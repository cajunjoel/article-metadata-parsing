BREEDING THE BLUE-BACKED MANAKIN
CHIROXIPHIA PAREOLA AT LONDON ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9868716" page_id="56811468"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By P. J. Olney
The Blue-backed Manakin Chiroxiphia pareola has the characteristics
of a typical member of its family, the Pipridae. It is a short-toed, stout-
bodied, short broad-billed bird about the size of a House Sparrow Passer
domesticus. In this species the sexes are strikingly different. The male
is predominantly velvety-black with a sharply contrasting pale-blue back
and a flat somewhat triangular shaped red skull-cap. The legs are pale
orange and the eyes are black. The female is far less ornate and is mainly
olive-green above with somewhat paler underparts. They are fruit
eaters and are found in or by the forests of South America and Tobago.
A pair of these beautiful birds have been kept in the Tropical House
at London Zoo since 1971--the female since May and the male since
December. The house has a flying space of approximately 65 ft. x 45 ft.
with a height of 12 ft. The temperature averages 7o*F (21 *C), and during
most of the year there are normal hours of daylight.
The birds rarely appeared to be close together and it was with some
surprise that the female was seen to be sitting on a nest in late May 1972.
The nest was an ordinary canary-type plastic pan, 4 in. diameter and 2 in.
deep, suspended from the wall some 6 ft. from ground level. The
nest-pan had been filled with moss, dead leaves and plant fibres, and the
female sat, with most of her body exposed, over a small indentation in
which lay the two eggs. The eggs were heavily speckled with chocolate-
brown spots on a bluish-buff background. One egg measured 25 mm.
x 17 mm. and weighed 2*2 grams. Unfortunately the female was already
incubating when the occupied nest was first noticed and no accurate
incubation period could be recorded. It was thought to be about 17 days.
Only the female incubated and the male appeared to take no further
part in the proceedings after copulation though in a second attempt at
nesting he was seen to fly to the nest-pan, settle and begin to shape the
cup by turning round while sitting. This behaviour does not seem to
have been recorded before as all accounts stress that the female carries out
all nesting activities alone.
One egg hatched on the 5th June, the other proved to be infertile.
The youngster was fed by the female alone on fruit coated with vionate--

mainly bananas, pear, grape and tomato. Mealworms were seen to be
taken to the nest, but were not seen to be given. The fruit was carried
in the mouth and bill, and during the first two weeks appeared to be
regurgitated but later was fed direct. The partly fledged youngster left
the nest after 14 days though it could only flutter from perch to perch
and frequently ended up on the ground. As there was considerable
danger of it being trodden on, drowned in the moat, or snatched up by a
visitor, mother and child were removed to the safety of the Bird House.
Here it remained dependant on the mother for a further 14 days, by
which time it could fly. The feathering of the head was the last plumage
to appear and even when fully winged the adolescent still had a partly
bald appearance. Otherwise it was very similar to the female, with olive-
green feathering above, and paler plumage below. The legs were pale
pink rather than the orange of the adult.
The female was returned to the Tropical House and further nesting
activity was seen after three weeks. Two eggs were laid, but proved to
be infertile.
Recently, at the beginning of October, courtship behaviour has been
seen and this followed closely that described by Gilliard (1959) and
Snow (1963, 1971) from birds observed in the wild. As there was only
one male involved in this case the interesting and well-recorded co-
ordinated courtship dance in which pairs of males would play an equal
part could not be observed.
Two forms of stereo-typed display were seen. In the first the male
made short fluttering jumps from a low horizontal steel pipe. The
ground around this perch was clear of vegetation and fallen leaves, though
it was not known if the bird had cleared away obstructions, as reported in
the wild (Gilliard 1959, Snow 1963). The bird would alight on the
perch, rise into the air and come down again a short distance from where
it started--always it seemed to end up on the perch facing the opposite
direction to which it started. In the air it would give a low whirring or
buzzing call. The display did not last for very long, and it looked as
though the jumps became more rapid and less high as the display continued,
until finally the bird flew away from the area.
The second type of display was quite different from the jump-display
and appeared to be a prelude to copulation. The female was present
but partly hidden by vegetation at one end of the display perch. The
male rose above the perch, facing the female and almost hovered with
shallow rapid rather butterfly-like wing beats. He then landed on the
perch in front of the female with his whole body held at an angle so that
his pale-blue back and red skull-cap were prominently displayed. This
stereo-typed display occurred three times before he flew into the vegetation
where he presumably mounted the female. Immediately afterwards he
flew the length of the house and then began to feed.

BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BUNTING
EMBERIZA BRUNICEPS AT CHESTER ZOO
By William H. Timmis
(Curator of Birds and Mammals, Chester Zoo, England)
Description
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.961165208333333" page_id="56811466"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
Emberiza bruniceps is sexually dimorphic; the males are " chestnut "
(the chestnut pigment is restricted, however, to the whole head and throat;
this extends onto the upper breast.) The sides of the neck and entire
underparts are bright yellow; the upperparts, mantle and back are olive-
yellow streaked with black; the rump and upper tail-coverts are yellow
and unstriped. Wings and tail are brown with pale edges to the coverts
and there is no white on the tail. One of our males has the head and
throat reddish gold instead of the usual chestnut. There is, according
to H. Witherby (1938), great individual variation in the males, especially
in the colour of the crown, which is from bright chestnut to golden yellow.
The adult female is brown above, streaked with darker brown; the
underparts are a mixture of buff and yellow and the rump is yellowish-
green with slight brown flecks. The chestnut plumage worn by the
male undoubtedly presents the fully adult dress and it would seem from
our observations that it is not acquired until the bird enters into its
second year.
Range and Habitat
Although only a rare vagrant to the British Isles, the Red-headed
Bunting has quite a wide distribution in the Palaearctic region, breeding
in the Aral-Caspian, Transcaspia, Kirghiz Steppes, Turkestan, Semi-
palatinsk to Altai region, north-east and east Persia, north Baluchistan
and Afghanistan. On migration and in winter from September to March
it is found in Sind, the Punjab, Rajputana, the North West Frontier and
Kashmir, through the central provinces south to the Nilgiri hills. Whistler

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BUNTING
(1949) writes that on the spring passage, vast clouds of Red-headed
Buntings along with Black-headed {Emberiza melanocephald) occur among
the ripening crops; on being flushed they fly into the nearest tree, making
it appear a yellow mass, and it is noteworthy that these flocks then consist
almost entirely of males. These flocks are very bold and are only driven
with difficulty from a field where they have decided to feed, and owing to
their numbers they can be responsible for a great deal of damage. In the
autumn they also do a certain amount of damage to jowar and similar
crops but on that passage they are not usually so noticeable. Out of 16
or so species of Buntings occurring in India the Red-headed is possibly
the most numerous.
It has no subspecies but in the south its breeding range overlaps that
of the Black-headed Bunting {Emberiza melanocephald) and Paludan (1940)
records that hybrids between melanocephala and bruniceps are known
from the region south-east of the Caspian Sea, males having heads black
and chestnut-brown admixed. Meinertzhagen (1954) writing about
melanocephala in the Balkans and east Afghanistan, where it hybridises
freely with bruniceps , states that the latter may well be a race of Emberiza
melanocephala.
As an accidental wanderer, the Red-headed Bunting has been found
in Italy, Belgium, Heligoland, Great Britain and Eire. It inhabits open
areas with scrub, cultivations with bushes and thick weeds, also arid
desert and steppe land with areas of water supporting reedbeds and
bushes. Outside the breeding season it is found largely in cultivated
areas and scrub jungle.
Housing
Two pairs of Red-headed Buntings were purchased on the 26th May
1971 and after a veterinary examination they were placed in an outside
aviary measuring 49 ft. 10 in. long x 10 ft. 6 in. wide x 5 ft. yin. high.
At one end there is a wooden shed measuring 10 ft. 6 in. wide x 10 ft. 10 in.
longxi2ft. high, which has a clear plastic sheet roof. The policy of
screening the faeces of all new additions to the collection has proved
especially valuable in the case of new bird arrivals where considerable
worm egg burdens are very often seen. It must also be stated, however,
that on certain occasions exotic specimens are received with parasitic
burdens which do not respond to treatment during the acclimatisation
period. The outside flight is heavily planted with shrubs. These
include Privet {Ligustrum avalifolium), Golden Privet {Ligustrum avalifolium
marginatum " aureum "), Holly {Ibex aquifoliaceae ), Laurel ( Laurus ),
{Polyganum cuspidatum ), Gorse {Ulex europaeus) and Honeysuckle
{Lonicera nitida). A large shallow concrete pool is situated in the centre
of the outside flight around which are several types of rushes and sedges.
One half of the flight is covered in short grass, the rest being washed river
sand. Branches cut from beech trees are fixed at various positions both

in the outside flight and inside shed. Other foreign birds kept in the
flight at the time of the introduction and eventual breeding included
various species of Weavers, Java Sparrows, Cut-throats, Green Singing
Finches, Diamond Doves, Zebra Finches, Bengalese, Waxbills and
Whydahs.
Breeding
No breeding activity was observed at all during 1971, the Buntings
going into moult in late September. During May 1972 one of the
females was seen carrying nesting material into a dense clump of Honey-
suckle (Lonicera nitida). Upon examination, a completed nest was found,
this being abandoned two days later due to Weavers taking a great deal
of the nest material. The female started building a second nest a few
days later, this being well concealed in Honeysuckle which had grown
over a short gorse bush. The nest was completed in a little over four
days and was a very untidy cup of grass mixed with dead leaves and long
stems of Lucerne. It was lined with hair and fine grassy fibres. Most
of the nesting material had been placed in the flight for the Weavers and
Whydahs, etc.
The work of building appeared to have been carried out by the female
alone. I noticed on several occasions that if the nesting material was
collected near to the nest site, the male would perch high on a branch
nearby, calling very softly, unless engaged in feeding or territorial disputes.
As with our Yellow-breasted Buntings (Timmis, 1972), when the female
Red-headed Bunting wandered further from the nest, she was generally
accompanied by the male, but he was never seen to take an active part in
nest building.
Incubation was carried out by the female only. In a total of over 60
visits to the nest, I always found the female incubating, except on two
occasions when no bird was present. Three eggs were laid at intervals
of a day; the hatching was completed in just under 22 hours, after an
incubation period of 14 days. A very interesting observation was the
way in which the female positioned the eggs, which were visible from the
side and partly from above. Because of this the female put the eggs on
the opposite side of the nest so that they always were out of the line of
vision of any possible intruder.
I never observed the male feeding the female on the nest during
incubation. The eggs were a ground colour, greyish-white, slightly
blotched with greenish brown and spotted all over with light brownish
and purple markings. One egg which did not hatch was measured in
our veterinary laboratory and measured 21 x 14*7 mm. In the Handbook
(Witherby, 1938) Jourdain gives the following measurements of 22 eggs:
average 20x 15*3 mm.; maximum 22*16 and 21*2x 16*5 mm.; minimum
19 x 15*6 and 20*2 x 14*5 mm.

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING THE RED-HEADED BUNTING
Care of Chicks
The young Buntings were brooded almost continuously for three or
four days after hatching and during this period the male was seen feeding
the female on the nest. After the period of close brooding by the female,
she sometimes brooded the young when the temperature was quite high
and at other times she left them uncovered when the air temperature was
lower; in fact the brooding did not appear to be correlated with air
temperature. The location of the nest, under an umbrella of gorse
thorns and Honeysuckle leaves, provided partial protection from the
direct rays of the sun and from the worst battering of the rain.
The nestlings were brownish above and had streaks of blackish-brown
in parts; the throat was yellowish red, turning to whitish yellow on the
chest and lower body. The food given by the parents to the young for
the first few days consisted of small insects and soaked seed fed by
regurgitation. After about three days the young were fed on caterpillars,
mealworms, maggots and soaked seed. The nestlings demanded the
constant attention of both parents, calling loudly for more food the
moment their bills were emptied.
Nest sanitation was carried out by both sexes although it appeared that
far more was done by the female and faeces lying around the rim of the
nest was removed by the first parent bird to arrive. I found that only
the female examined the interior of the faeces. The chicks did not
defecate until they were at least 34 hours old, after which they did so
regularly, about every two hours, by raising their cloacas towards the rim
of the nest before passing faeces. On some visits to the nest during feeding,
both the sexes would take a faecal sac and swallow it, but most times they
would fly some distance down the aviary before dropping it. We found
that the male took very little part in feeding the young until they were about
five days old, after which the number of visits in which food was brought
to the nest was approximately equal for the two sexes. If the female
was on the nest when the male arrived with food, or in some cases if the
two birds arrived at the nest together, the female generally took the food
from the male to give to the young.
The fledging period was 15 days and at that stage the young Buntings
looked very like the female, except that they were a shade lighter in colour
and the bill was greyish-brown above and below. Two Buntings left
the nest and for several days perched quite near to the site, occasionally
fluttering down onto the ground where they would peck at food when in
fact they were not hungry; they also pecked at markings on leaves and on
the aviary netting. It appeared to be more curiosity than hunger. If the
young Buntings were hungry they always gaped and begged, even begging
at food which had fallen on the ground, instead of pecking it up.
The adults continued to feed them for almost two weeks after leaving
the nest, after which time they had gained strength and ability to fly
around the aviary and fend for themselves.

Voice
The call of the male is a " chipz-chew " with a pause between syllables
like a rusty gate swinging back and forth. This is delivered from a bush
or tree. In flight the call sounds like " tchirp " in the male and " chawp "
in the female. The song consists of a descending phrase with a kick up
at the end, usually preceded by four or five preliminary notes. The last
phrase is repeated two or three times without a pause; the song has a
number of variants. In flight it runs several times together and also at
times is speeded up. We have on occasions heard birds singing whilst
on the ground.
As described above, the Red-breasted Bunting, Emberiza bruniceps , has
been bred at Chester Zoo. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Assistant Editor.

RELEASE OF A CAPTIVE-BRED BARN OWL
(Tyto alba alba)

The release and rehabilitation of captive-bred owls has been achieved
with planned programmes and feeding support of the birds released.
Wayre (1970) has described the method employed for the release and
rehabilitation of Barn Owls (Tyto alba alba) and Little Owls (.Athene
noctua vidalii). This consists of the release of the young when fledged
and feeding them every night on top of the aviary, with the parents kept
inside.

Having bred Barn Owls for three seasons (for first year's results see
Trollope, 1971) I decided this year to release one bird as a pilot attempt
at rehabilitation. However, living in a very built up, populous and noisy
area, the aviary feeding technique used by Wayre could only end in

disasater for the released bird. Therefore I had to find a suitable place
for the release, close enough to make nightly feeding visits possible.
What I envisaged was a derelict barn or building of large size near a park,
or similar area, then to release the bird in the building, which would be
used as a feeding site.
This was obviously far from an ideal method, but I thought it worth a
try, having postponed such an attempt the two previous seasons. Local
bird watchers informed me of a derelict house in a builder's yard, near a
large park and golf course, about three miles from where I live. I
obtained permission to use it from the manager of the building firm,
who was most co-operative.
The bird was released on 7th September 1972. It appeared to be a

cock and was the whitest-breasted Barn Owl I have seen, rather paler
than most birds on the dorsal surface. It was from a second generation
of captive breeding and when released was aged 106 days, weighed
12 oz. and wore a leg ring.
Result
Unfortunately the bird left the building on the day of release. This
I think was due to three factors:
1. The bird was too nervous to remain in a fairly busy area.
2. The building was not large enough.
3. I released it in the wrong part of the building, where " escape "
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.959114071428572" page_id="56811461"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
was too easy.
I continued to leave food in the house in the forlorn hope that the bird
would return. Neither the bird watchers or myself could see any sign
of the owl during the following weeks. I contacted the local R.S.P.C.A.
clinics in case it had been picked up exhausted or injured.
I was consequently both surprised and pleased to see the bird alive and
looking fit on the mornings of 8th November 1972 and again on 15th
November 1972. On both occasions it was perched on top of a hawthorn
hedge which borders the golf course about a quarter of a mile from the
release point. Obviously with the winter ahead the bird has a long way
to go before it could be considered rehabilitated. However, the fact that
a second generation captive bred owl has survived in feral conditions
without feeding support for just over two months, I consider to be worthy
of record.

(Tricholaema diadematum)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
Barbets are close relatives of the woodpeckers and have many of their
engaging habits. Their reputation for destroying the woodwork in their
aviaries, even to the extent of boring through thick wooden walls and
doors, has not made them generally popular with aviculturists, which is
a pity, first because they are most interesting birds which well reward
study; second because one can suit one's inclinations and have fruit-
eating, insect-eating or omnivorous species; third because in my ex-
perience their destructive capabilities can very largely be kept within
bounds by providing plenty of rotten logs.
The name " barbet " comes from the bristles around the bill (these
can be seen in Plate 2 ) and probably also from the fact that some species
have tufts of feathers near the base of the upper mandible. All barbets--
and there are over seventy species--nest in holes, some in natural or
other bird's boles in trees but most boring their own in rotten timber,
sand or earth banks or even perpendicularly downwards in level ground.
My Red-fronted Barbets followed me back in April 1972 from East
Africa, where I had arranged to meet Tim Barnley who obtained them
for me and saw to their transport. In parenthesis I should like to add
that it would have been impossible for greater care to have been taken
than he took over the packing and forwarding of these and two other pairs
of birds which he sent me at the same time: so well-designed and sturdily-
constructed were the travelling-cages that the air freight cost more than
the birds!
This is also an opportunity to pay tribute to the powers that be in Kenya
for the way in which they control the export of their birds. A permit
to trap a bird, or birds, of a particular species has first to be obtained, the
decision to award or withhold it being in the hands of a committee which
sits monthly in Nairobi, and before the permit is forthcoming the trapper
has to pay a fee equivalent to 10% of the amount which he will receive
for the birds. This permit is for a bird or birds of a given species, and
alternatives are not allowed: for example, to make things easier--as I
thought--I asked for one pair of either of two species of barbet, but this
was not allowed and I had to specify exactly which. How very cheering
it would be if all countries would adopt a similar attitude to the trade in
their native birds, so that a stop might be put to the excessive drain
upon the wild which is now going on.
Red-fronted Barbets are locally common from Southern Sudan and
Central Ethiopia south through Kenya and Uganda to Tanzania and
Malawi, and they are inhabitants of the bush country and especially in
acacia woodland near water-courses. With the exception of Tinker

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE RED-FRONTED BARBET
birds they are among the smallest members of the family, being about
nuthatch size though rather shorter and plumper, and their habits and
general deportment might be described as a combination of nuthatch and
small woodpecker. They are generally black above with yellow streaks,
and white to yellowish-white below; some birds have the very faintest
trace of brown spots on the lower breast. They have a bright red forehead
and pale yellow supercilliary stripes shading backwards into white. They
have a moderately long, stout black bill and dark grey legs. The sexes
are alike in plumage. #
When mine first arrived they very obviously disliked the cold of a
British April--or rather the 6o*F at which my bird-room was kept, and
they looked very unhappy until I put an infra-red lamp on them, although
they fed well from the start. After a week or two they were allowed into
the flight--24 ft. x 4 ft 6 in.--and, despite miserable weather, they
immediately improved. They are not happy in close confinement, even
though in this case the " confinement " consisted of a section of birdroom
8 ft. x 5 ft. x 4 ft. 6 in. Needless to say I gave them no companions.
It was not long before I was fairly sure that I had two birds of a sex,
probably males. One was aggressively dominant to the extent that the
other began to skulk in the shelter, seeming unwilling to go out into the
flight when the other bird was there and only dared to snatch a bit of
food while fearfully " looking over its shoulder ". On the other hand,
only the dominant bird was noisy while the other has never been heard to
utter a sound, but I was pessimistic enough to think that this was due to
their very unbalanced relationship rather than to the fact that they were
male and female, especially since vicious chasing had begun and I was
beginning to consider the need to separate them. My pessimism grew
worse when one of them took over a nest-box at the far end of the flight
while the other started boring a hole in a rotten tree-stump in the shelter.
However, gloom eased a little when relations improved sufficiently for
both of them to take turns at boring.
Their method was interesting: each would attack the wood, hammering
away until a piece was loosened at one end; this was then seized and torn
off and, when a large beakful was free, it was carried to the far end of the
flight and dropped on to an ever-increasing heap. Amazingly, small
pieces of wood were swallowed and regurgitated on to the heap; practically
nothing remained beneath the hole to give away the site to enemies.
The entrance hole was small for the size of the bird---a very tight squeeze--
and was not perfectly round but rather irregular like that of a Willow Tit,
Parus montanus.
Hopes really did soar when courtship feeding and then mating were seen
(the dominant bird was the male), and one bird began spending long periods
in the hole. Meanwhile, relations continued to be intermittently very
* Subsequent close examination has shown that in this pair the male has rather
more red on the forehead than the female.

strained, and the vicious chases were all the more alarming since they did
not culminate in mating, and appeared to be done out of pure spite.
Whatever their cause, there can be no doubt that the female spent a great
deal of her time absolutely terrified of her mate. Mating took place in a
most casual manner, with no preliminary display, after the two birds
had one of their rare periods of sitting peacefully side by side preening.
Far more often than not it was unsuccessful.
Any hope of breeding disappeared when one morning it was seen that
there was a gaping hole in the side of the log: they had opened up the
nest cavity, whether from inside or out we could not tell. So that was
that, and " summer " was fast passing. A new log was put up in place of
the old (they had in fact a choice of five logs in the aviary), but they ignored
it and it seemed as though even their very half-hearted desire to breed had
left them. In a final attempt to stimulate them I cut a hole in the bark
and exposed the soft wood within--immediately they started to bore.
Again they took it in turns, and again they carried their winnings to the
far end of the flight, where they filled their bath with them. Since they
are reputed to favour the vicinity of streams for breeding, one is tempted
to wonder whether this depositing of wood-chippings in their bath was
the equivalent of dropping them in a stream where they would be carried
far away from the vicinity of the nest-site.
Although it was impossible to be quite sure when it started, there was
soon little doubt that incubation was taking place, since frequent nest-
relief was seen. The relieving bird did not by any means always wait
for its mate to leave the nest, but either clung to the tree outside the hole
(presumably making a noise that I could not hear) or went inside and
down to the cavity. Sometimes both were in together for quite long
periods. This made it equally impossible to be sure when hatching took
place, but it was a few days before the 26th August, on which date my
diary reads: " R-f Barbets feeding hard, mainly on chopped lettuce.
Swallow food and regurgitate--do not carry it in bill. Do not always
allow very long for digestion, sometimes as little as two minutes."
For the first few days chopped lettuce and chickweed was the favourite
food, but the youngster's menu was gradually enlarged until it was being
fed on the widest variety of food that I have ever experienced--all, of
course, regurgitated by the parents: chopped lettuce, chickweed, grated
cheese (little), chopped hard-boiled or scrambled egg-yolk, soft food,
chopped raisins and currants, apples, mashed carrot (little), maggots
(few), mealworms and small locusts. Until 9th September (that is for
over a fortnight) one parent was almost continuously in the nest, and from
1st September faeces were seen to be carried away; presumably it had
been swallowed prior to this.
On 9th September, and thereafter, both parents were off most of the
time, though both continued to visit the hole to feed at frequent intervals--
surprisingly frequent considering that regurgitation was employed.

M. D. ENGLAND--BREEDING THE RED-FRONTED BARBET
During this time persecution of the female by the male intensified, to be
interrupted occasionally by brief periods of truce when courtship-feeding
and mating took place. On 22nd September a youngster was looking out
of the hole and was being fed by the male with egg-yolk in beakfuls, not
swallowed and regurgitated. The female continued to feed by regurgita-
tion, using a rapid " pumping " action with the bill inserted far into the
youngster's gape.
On the 23rd our hopes received a crushing blow--the nest-compartment
had been torn open again and there was no sign of a youngster: a thorough
search of both flight and shelter failed to find even feathers, the nest had
not even any broken egg-shells in it, and the parents seemed completely
unconcerned. I was miserably leaving, after another fruitless search,
when a very faint noise caught my ear--and there was a youngster looking
out of the hole; it had been " up the spout " all the time, clinging between
entrance hole and nest-cavity. That night it descended to the nest to
roost (in full view, of course) and the next morning left it for good.
Rather unexpectedly it did not return to the hole at night, but roosted out
in the flight with no shelter whatever. Meanwhile, the female parent
had dug herself a roosting hole in another tree, which she continues to use.
As will have been gathered, there was only one youngster, and no
evidence at all of there ever having been more, or more than one egg.
The one which was reared, however, was fully developed on leaving the
nest, and was indistingushable from its parents except on very close
inspection, which showed that the small patch of red on the forehead
which gives the bird its name was replaced by black. A very
faint mewing, to human ears audible only from a few feet, which
was heard on its last day in the hole, and again when it was caught up for
ringing, is the only sound it has been heard to utter, and its mother never
seems to make any sound at all. The male has three calls, one of which--\0x25A0
a not very loud he-he-he--very similar to the call of the Lesser Spotted
Woodpecker, Dendrocopos minor --was heard a few times only when the
birds first arrived. His main breeding-season call is a rapid version of
the " poo " of a Hoopoe Upupa epops repeated six or more times, often,
though not always, with an accelerando towards the end. This is uttered
with the bill pointing downwards and the throat " blown out in a
similar fashion to hoopoes and coucals. His other call, which is probably
a contact call and, I suspect, would also be used by the female were she
not so persistently in a cowed state, is almost exactly a louder version of
the call of an Owl Finch (Bicheno or Double-bar) Poephila bichenovii ., a
rasping nasal aark.
Summary
The breeding in an aviary of Red-fronted Barbets Tricholaema
diadematum is described. They bored a hole in a rotten stump of Silver
Birch Betula pendula , but this was left unused after they had broken open
the nest-cavity. A second hole--in another log of rotten Silver Birch--

was bored by both birds and one youngster was reared in it. This was
fed by regurgitation by both parents, which also shared incubation and
brooding. Incubation and fledging periods could not be ascertained, but
the latter was certainly in excess of 28 days, though probably not much
so. On the last day before the youngster left the nest, the nest cavity was
opened up in a similar fashion to the previous one, as also was the hen's
roosting hole.

has been bred by M. D. England at Neatishead, Norfolk; it is believed
this may be a first success.

By George A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
In my article on nesting and nestling parrots (Avicultural Magazine,
1972, pp. 155-164) I was foolish enough to write that parrots appear to
make no attempt at nest sanitation. This is certainly not true for Black-
headed Caiques Pionites melanocephala and with hindsight have reason to
suspect that it is untrue for other parrots. Parent caiques scratch the soiled
litter out of the nest-hole and continually chew splinter from the inside of
the box to refurbish the floor covering. It was only when the supply of soft
wood, nailed inside the box for this purpose, was totally chewed away
that the nest became fouled by the chicks.
This could well be the explanation of two puzzling features of brush-
tongued parrots (Lories). Why do these birds, lapping nectar and eating
soft, yielding vegetable substances need such a powerful bite to their
beaks? Keas, for example, which are the size of a Raven are caught
by an ungloved hand to be leg-rung, or killed for government bounty
money, without giving the handler other than the slightest inconvenience
(Jackson, in corres.). I only hold lories, as other parrots, in my naked
hand after catching and positioning them in a hand-net as they can give
nasty, blood-drawing bites.
My second perplexity with brushed-tongued parrots was as to why the
youngsters, in captivity, are almost invariably badly plucked while in the
nest? Some other " sorts " of parrot chew their youngsters' feathers.
Mostly, I feel, for some aggressive reason as the skin is often marked and
the head often suffers; but with lories it is the whole body, save wings and
tail, and the head feathering is left intact making them look as if they had
had a " pudding-basin hair-cut ".

I now believe, partly proved by the manner in which nest-boxes are
"eaten" by these birds, that in a "natural" nest cavity the parents
would rain-down--by chewing--a periodical shower of parings to absorb
the faeces of the young. The plucking of the chicks can then be seen as
done to " satisfy " this parental instinct. Dilger notes that soiled nests
stimulate parent lovebirds to fetch further quantities of nest litter. This
need to pare would satisfactorily explain the powerful bite of these birds.
While on the subject of nests much has been made of a species of moth
whose larvae feed in the nest litter of the Golden-shouldered Parrakeet
Psephotus chrysopterygius (e.g. p. 109 in Immelmann's Australian
Parrakeets).
My own nest-boxes commonly house two species of moth: the Clothes
moth and the Flour-moth--which, if my (schoolboy) memory serves me
right, is Esphestia kuhniella. The Clothes moth feeding on feathers and
"scruff" and the Flour moth, in its cobweb tube, living on the rich
organic dust thrown up by the birds. Most damp nest-boxes have
Housefly Musca domestica maggots feeding in the top layers by the late
summer and early autumn; perhaps a more careful survey would reveal
more cases of " commensalism ".
In their article on the behaviour of some African parrots the Holyoaks
(Avicultural Magazine, 1972, p. 89) suggest that Budgerigars and Grass-
parrakeets Neophema spp. hold food steady by standing on it when they eat.
They also say that Poicephalus parrots pick food items directly up with a
foot and then transfer it to the bill. I have tried to entice literally scores and
scores of Budgerigars and Grass-parrakeets to use the feet when feeding
on millet spray and Annual meadow-grass Poa annua pannicles. I try
to present this in such an awkward way--part pushed through the wires
or laying across a perch--that they should find it easier to use the foot
than to feed directly. I have yet to see a Budgerigar even attempt to use
its foot. Brockway (1964, Behaviour 22, p. 200) who has made a detailed
study of Budgies says that they make no feeding use of the feet. Some
individual Grass Parrakeets will use their feet to clasp food to the perch--
especially Blue-winged and Elegants N. chrysostoma and N. elegans --it is
less common in Turquoisines N. pulchella and I have yet to see
Splendids N. splendida or Bourke's N. hourkei involve the feet in any way.
Because the inability to use the feet is a recent development it would be
highly improbable if all Budgerigars or grass-parrakeets were incapable
of using the feet.
But for the two exceptions listed in my article on the use made by
parrots in feeding (Avicultural Magazine, 1971, pp. 93--100) I have not
seen a parrot directly take an item up in the foot. The following letter,
from Mr. Mats Tell of Ljungbyhed, Sweden, has some interesting points
on the use of the foot. He writes: " I should like to report two rather
interesting observations on my own birds.

A 1969-bred cock was seen, for the first time, using his feet when
feeding in the 1971 breeding season. When rearing chicks, he was every
day given large quantities of different green food. He would then fly
down, bite off a clover blossom, grasp it in his foot and eat it just the
same way as a Rosella. I have never seen him handle other green
food in this way, although I think dandelion seed-heads would be very
suitable. None of the young have hitherto developed their father's
unique habit, nor have I seen or heard of it before. None of my friends,
many of whom have fine Neophema collections, have ever seen it among
their birds.

One of my cocks is especially fond of pears. Fallen pears are often
pecked upon by wild Blackbirds and Fieldfares and I often throw these
into the Stanley aviary (of course I never normally give my parrots fruit
on the floor). This particular cock often bites off a considerable piece
and eats it, holding it in his ' hand ' in a normal way. However, when
disturbed--say, when a Buzzard is flying over--he drops it and, still
watching the Buzzard, picks it up again with the foot when the ' enemy '
is too far away to be considered as a danger. All my other Stanleys
(when in a similar situation) pick up their food with their bills."
It is rather difficult to obtain certain information on behaviour and I
would be most grateful if someone could tell me whether male Amazon
(Amazona) and Red-vented ( Pionus ) parrots when pairing, like all the other
observed American parrots, keep one foot on the perch and place but one on
the back of the female? All the Old-world parrots stand with both feet
on the back of the female.

Practically every year one has to state that the weather has been
unfavourable, in one way or another, for the welfare of exotic birds in the
supposedly priviledged climate of North-Western Europe, and 1972 was
no exception.
At Cleres, after a warm month of March, April, May and even early
June were unusually cold, windy and dry, and so, on the whole, was the
summer. That indeed interfered with the satisfactory reproduction of
many species, and numbers of infertile eggs resulted, as males simply
failed to come into breeding condition at the proper time. It was very
disappointing. But let us forget failures and remember mostly successes.
The two pairs of Emus again did well, producing 26 young. The Rheas
however again laid very late, and only two (one white) were raised.
Wattled Cranes and Demoiselles laid clear eggs, but we reared a Black
Crown Crane. Since 1920, when some of those birds first arrived at
Cleres, this is only the second time that eggs have been laid. In 1939 a
mixed pair Black x Grey had nested, building in August a large nest of
seeds and grass and laying three eggs. They all hatched and the young
were reared, only to disappear at the beginning of the war.
There are at present in the park and gardens seven Black and ten Grey
Crown Cranes. This year, a pair of Blacks set up a territory and laid close to
the fence along the river. The nest was very small and only two eggs were
laid. The parents were wary and the female often left the nest, finally
deserting the two chipped eggs for some unknown reason. They were
picked up cold, but one chick was saved and successfully hand-reared.
A pair of Black-necked Swans nested twice, first in March, then again
in July, after they had reared the first brood. They hatched six, then
seven cygnets, but reared three and four only, the female killing several
chicks after a couple of weeks, a very strange performance.
Two pairs of Cereopsis Geese, each isolated in a large meadow, hatched
and reared 12 goslings, both in February. Other goslings raised include
Swan, Greylag, Snow, Bar-headed, Giant Canada, Nene, Black Brent,
Magellan and Ashy-headed. Several Emperor and one Ross's chicks
died by accident. A special mention must be made of two young Red-
breasted goslings reared; a poor performance as we have seven pairs on
the grounds. One of them is partly albinistic; while the head and neck are
hardly paler than in normal specimens, with the usual complicated pattern,
the rest of the plumage is generally grey instead of black, with pale grey
blotches and white markings.
There were a number of Common, Ruddy, South African and Paradise
Shelducks; also 17 Moluccan Radjahs from one pair which laid three

clutches clear; the old pair of Australian Radjahs, the last one in Europe as
far as I know, again laid eleven eggs; I am afraid they are past the age of
successful breeding. A brood of n Maned Geese was raised by the
mother.
A number of various ducklings were lost owing to an epidemic of
salmonellosis, for the first time at Cleres, but others were reared, both in
pens and at liberty, including Yellow-billed, Indian Spot-billed, Pacific-
grey, Philippine and Hawaiian Mallards; Gadwalls, Pantails, Shovellers;
Bahamas; Mandarins and Carolinas; Puna, Silver, Cape, Sharp-winged
Teal; Pochards, Red-heads, White-eyes, Australian White-eyes, New
Zealand Scoup. Unfortunately, unwanted hybrids cropped up, particu-
larly Baer Pochard x Chestnut Teal, Brazilian x Chestnut Teal, Brazilian
x Kerguelen Pintail, Chiloe x European Wigeons. The first mentioned

are handsome, intermediate in shape between the parents, the male a
bright, purplish-chestnut shot with metallic reddish all over.
An interesting incident occurred with an old pair of Silver Teal, which
had long been secluded on a small pond for breeding purposes, but had
failed to produce healthy chicks the last few years. They were released
on the lake to make room for a younger pair, the result being a happy one:
the old birds did rear there three perfect youngsters.
Game birds were not very successful. The world is now so polluted
and infectious diseases so widespread that it becomes difficult to cope with
such dangerous conditions, particularly on grounds where they have been
kept for so long. Only Junglefowl were raised in numbers. Jabouille's
Red, Ceylon and Sonnerat's, and of course the commoner species such as
Golden, Amherst's, Swinhoe's, Silvers. But we had only a few young
Siamese and Malay Firebacks, two Monals, seven Edwards', many pea-
fowl, and one Bare-faced Curassow (C. fasciolata). The Brush Turkeys
did poorly, although nests were well built and attended, only one chick
came out.
Many Pigeons and Doves were reared: Olive (C. arquatrix ), Wongas,
Bar-tailed (M. unchall ), Mountain Witch, Bleeding-heart, Lemon,
Bronze-winged, and several other more ordinary species.
The number of Parrots kept at Cleres has to be somewhat limited as
we do not particularly enjoy the bare, unplanted aviaries required by
these destructive birds. There are however two free-flying Macaws,
female Red and Blue and Blue and Yellow, plus a somehow crippled male
of the latter species ( ararauna ). No more can be let out as the resident
birds would drive them away. There was a nice colony of Quaker
Parrakeets at liberty, but local Jackdaws, which breed on the high walls
of the chateau, incessantly attacked them, taking over their huge nests
of twigs, and finally they went away.
Some 20 specially built aviaries are inhabited by Cockatoos (including
Leadbeater's), Macaws (Leah Ambiguous), Amazons and other Parrots
and Parrakeets. Two Crimson-winged were reared and Bourke's breed

in a large planted flight, as they are almost the sole members of the family
they do not damage vegetation.
Seven species of Touracos live at Cleres but only one, Knysna, have
bred successfully this year, two pairs producing six young, three of which
reached maturity. A regrettable accident took place after two young, just
out of the nest, were removed when the male, evidently disturbed, killed
the female.
Three Kookaburras were hand-reared, the eggs being removed and
hatched in an incubator, as the parent birds have developed the habit of
devouring the chicks as soon as they are out of the shell.
We had some success with Passerine birds. Over 20 Superb Spreos,
several Diamond Sparrows, and two Baltimore Orioles were raised in the
aviaries, the latter species probably for the first time in Europe. We also
hand-reared five Fairy Bluebirds, three Orange-headed ground Thrushes
and one Fulvous-fronted Parrotbill (Paradoxornis fulvifrons ), all of them
taken from the nest when eight to ten days old. Several broods of these
species had met with failure in aviaries earlier in the season, the chicks
being killed in the nest by other birds when the mother began to leave
then unattended during the day, or soon after they had left it. The
breeding of a small Parrotbill, or Suthora, is probably the first of that
genus in captivity. All these hand-reared birds are, of course, delightfully
tame.
Black-eared Weavers (Malimbus melanotis) built several beautiful
hanging nests and laid, but no chicks came out. Rothschild's Starlings,
White-winged Blue and Black-faced Scarlet Tanagers did not rear their
young this year. Tacazze Sunbirds also failed and a female Violet-eared
Hummingbird built several nests without laying. A deplorable loss was
that of a cock Scarlet-necked Tanager (Anisognathus igniventris ), killed
by another bird (possibly a Pink-crested Touraco) when a brood of two
had just hatched in a privet bush. The female failed to raise the chicks.

By Dr. Peter R. Richards (Cookham Dean, Berkshire, England)
I have been interested in the Rook for many years, and have been
keeping them in captivity since 1951, when I had hand-reared my first
fledgling. I qualified in Medicine in 1959, and as I had to take a resident
appointment in hospital, I reluctantly passed on my birds to Dr.
Coombs, of Perren-ar-Worthal, in Cornwall; but from 1966 onwards I
was able to keep the Rooks again.
The birds live in an aviary, which is situated in my garden. It is
18 ft. wide, 24 ft. long and about 8 ft. high. It is irregular in shape, and
built between two large elm trees. The floor is earth, and turves of grass
are laid every few months, but are rapidly destroyed by the birds.
There are no natural perches, but artificial perches are provided in
many parts of the aviary. As some of the birds are crippled with injured
wings all the perches are near to the ground to enable the birds to climb
up if they cannot fly.
The aviary is surrounded with 1 in. mesh wire netting. Some protection
is provided from the rain, by means of corrugated polythene sheeting, but
that is all.
Nest sites are provided, by selecting branches with natural forks and
cutting them to suitable lengths. They are then placed in the aviary
about 6 ft. apart. Rooks show an interest in nesting material at all times
in the year, except in mid-summer when they are going through the
post-nuptial moult. I find there is no difficulty in inducing them to use
these nest sites, but, as it takes rather a long time for the birds to lodge
the first few sticks in the fork and form a foundation, I usually assist them
by tying a few twigs into the site I have selected. I choose a site about
6 ft. from the ground, and in a position where I can clearly observe the
nesting behaviour.
There are no other species of birds in the aviary now, but at one time
there were some jackdaws, Corvus monedula.
A bath is provided in the form of an upturned dustbin lid, and the
water is changed daily. All the birds take at least one daily bath.
In 1966 I started keeping Rooks again, this time finding a late fledgling
on 1 st June, in Norfolk. This bird turned out to be a hen, but unfor-
tunately I was unable to acquire a mate for her until the summer of 1968.
This pair are later referred to as Pair A.
Nothing daunted this hen fell madly in love with my collie bitch,
and in April 1968 laid a clutch of eggs. These inevitably were infertile,
and I put some wild rook's eggs under her. She hatched these, but alas
the young perished from starvation after a few days, because at the time

I did not realize the female rook contributes practically nothing to the
nourishment of her young until they are well feathered.
The following year in 1969, she laid again, in the meantime pairing with
a crippled cock rook with an injured wing. Unfortunately, this was
unsuccessful, as the cock ate every egg she laid, and has done so ever since.
In 1970, this Pair A laid again, but her eggs were again eaten. By
that time I had acquired several more rooks, so that in 1971, I had three
adult pairs and some yearlings. A hen that had been brought to me in
1969, aged two years, and another old cock rook with a broken wing, had
paired up (Pair B). They made a fine nest in early 1971, starting building
on 27th February and completing by 25th March. She laid four eggs,
the first on 28th March, and the last on 4th April. They hatched after
19 days incubation, the first on 15th April and the last on 19th April.
I was not adequately prepared regarding the amount of food that the
young would require, and the young perished by the 25th April. She
laid a second clutch of eggs, between the 4th and 8th of May, but none
hatched.
In 1972, I still had the original hen, but the cock I had given to a
friend, and alas the hen has made no effort to pair with any other rooks
and did not nest at all.
The second pair, Pair B, that bred in 1971, started nest building on
4th March. They chose a new site as a younger pair, Pair D, had usurped
their original site, and had built a nest that contained eggs by the 8th of
March. The nest of Pair B was completed by the 12th March, and she
had lined the cup of the nest by the 13th March, and was becoming
broody and begging constantly for food with a wing shaking, juvenile
gesture, and the typical, high pitched caw that is so prevalent in rookeries
at this time of the year.
Nest site selection seems to be made by the hen, but nest building is
conducted by both sexes. Much of the material is brought by the cock,
and the actual construction is largely conducted by the hen. The hen
contributes largely to the lining.
Perfectly adequate nests can be built by single birds of either sex, as I
have found that cocks who have lost their mates will continue to complete
a nest, and hens, for example A, can build and complete a nest in the
absence of a suitable mate.
The first egg was laid on the 15th March, the second on the 16th, until
the clutch was complete on the 22nd March, consisting of six eggs.
Incidently, Pair D suffered from the same fate as Pair A; the cock ate
all the eggs. He was released, and can be seen strutting about Hyde
Park and Kensington Gardens, one of the only two resident rooks in
Central London. The hen accompanying him was also one of my birds,
a particularly aggressive bird that I released at the same time because of
the trouble she caused with my little colony.
The hen of Pair B sat well and was regularly fed throughout incubation

by the cock. The first two eggs hatched on the night of 2nd April
(19+ 18 days) and another egg hatched on the 3rd April (18 days). The
fourth egg hatched on the 4th April (18 days) and the fifth egg, unfor-
tunately, cracked and the young died in the shell. The sixth egg hatched
on 6th April (16 days).
The young were grey-skinned with orange gapes when hatched, but
quickly grew until they had doubled their size by the fourth day, when
their skin had become quite black, and their gapes changed to carmine
pink. Feather tracts were making their appearance by this time. The
male rook was entirely responsible for feeding the young. The female
brooded all the time, only getting off the nest to stretch herself and uncover
the young when the male came to feed. Oddly enough, as has been noted
in the wild, when the cock arrived to feed the young the female begged
intensely for food, and only passed food onto the chicks when her own
hunger was satisfied. It was difficult to supply enough maggots, for
feeding the chicks, as these were used to the exclusion of everything else,
and the other rooks in the aviary also would eat up any maggots I supplied
in preference to their usual diet.
By nth April--8 days, the first feathers on the back were through, but
unfortunately the food supply was not meeting their demands, and on the
nth the youngest chick died of starvation, and on the 12th another died,
so I decided to hand-rear the remaining three myself.
The chicks that survived were ringed on the 12th April, aged 10, 8
aand 6 days. On the 13th April the oldest chick's eye opened, aged
11 days, and the smallest chick remaining died, leaving me with only two.
By the 17th of April the two chicks were gaping at my finger, and their
sight was obviously quite good.
Fortunately, although I hand-reared the first two chicks successfully,
on the 19th April the hen bird started relining her nest again. I had
reduced the number of rooks I was keeping from ten to six, releasing
some birds in Hyde Park.
The progress of the hand-reared rooklings was as follows:
By 14 days the feathers through on the back of the head, the back,
the scapula region and the primary and secondary flight quills were growing
fast. They grew very rapidly on a diet of chopped-up, day-old chicks
and a mixed mash of Lowes Meat Chips, layer pellets, bread soaked in
egg, corn, farlene, Sluis soft-bill, and groundnuts, on which the adult
rooks are basically fed.
By 21 days they were standing up and attempting to preen, their flight
feathers were about 1 in. long, and their legs had reached adult size.
By 25 days they were standing and flapping their wings and their head
and body growth was approximately completed. By the 27th day they
were standing on the edge of the nest, and on the 28th day they could
stand on one leg and scratch. By the 30th day they perched alongside
the nest, and by the 33rd day they could hop from one side of the

nest to the other. On the 35th day they could fly adequately. Their
wings were able to support their weight, but their tails were still about
half grown. It was not, however, until the 44th day that their wings and
tails had become fully grown, and they were not feeding completely
independently until August, although they could pick up food for them-
selves by the nth June (69 days). One of the two hand-reared birds
escaped, a hen, but the other, a cock, is alive and has moulted well.
A second brood followed a similar pattern, but by supplementing their
food supply by hand, the young in the nest had adequate supplies of food,
with the food brought to the young by the cock bird. I was able to rear
two chicks in the nest to maturity and to observe their parents' reaction
and behaviour.
The hen began to reline the nest on the 19th April, and the first egg
was laid on the 21st April. The clutch was completed by the 26th April,
and consisted of five eggs. The first two hatched on the 9th May, and
no others hatched, although one egg disappeared. The cock bird was
observed to remove the eggshell when the first egg hatched. The chicks
grew and behaved very similarly to the first brood, but because the rooks
were better at nest hygiene than I could be, numerous observations were
apparent that I missed in the hand-reared, first brood. The chicks were
covered with a fine down by eight days, and the parent birds spent a lot
of time preening and cleaning the young birds.
By the 19th day the young were well feathered, and the parent birds,
who up until this time tolerated my presence at the nest without getting
upset began to get very alarmed. My presence would cause great con-
sternation and alarm calls, the harsh grating caws were uttered, upsetting
all the other rooks, and the young rooks that I was feeding at about four
hourly intervals ceased to beg for food, and cringed in the bottom of
the nest. The hen bird ceased to brood the young continuously on the
29th May (21 days) and was seen to collect food and feed them herself
for the first time. She did not brood again after 3rd June, by which
time the young were 26 days old and were standing on the nest and flapping
their wings.
On the 7th June (30 days), they perched on sticks near the nest, and they
were flying by the 9th June (32 days). They, however, still returned to
the nest to roost until they were 34 days old.
The hen rook was responsible for most of their feeding, after leaving
the nest, the cock rook having started moulting.
I still have one of the first brood, but I exchanged the young of the
second brood on the 30th June, aged 53 days, for some other birds.
The young birds were not molested at all by the other adult birds at
any time. The parent rooks defended intensely the immediate tenancy
of the nest, in a radius of about one metre, and would not permit any other
bird within this area, the hen's territorial aggression being more intense
than that of the cock, which I have noted with all my rooks. When the

young left the nest they seemed to be quite confident of themselves, and
showed aggressive postures to strange birds that approached too close,
and were respected by other birds in the aviary. In fact, the young birds
have always been quite high in the heirarchy within the aviary. It is
only in autumn when the adult birds have completed their moult, and are
sexually highly active again, and the young birds are not showing any
overt sexual behaviour that they have slipped in the social hierarchy.
I think the successful breeding of these birds can be attributed to
there being a stable colony in which the individuals interact and stimulate
each other, and also to the large amount of live food in the form of
maggots and wax-moth larvae they receive.
I must say that since receiving the regular supplies of live food their
plumage has improved, and even in the wettest days their feathers retain
their sheen and water-repellant qualities.
As described above, Dr. P. R. Richards has bred the Rook, Corvus
frugilegus. It is believed that this may be a first success.

BREEDING THE CASQUED HORNBILL
AT "BIRDWORLD"
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99642245" page_id="56811413"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. P. M. Harvey (Holt Pound, Farnham, Surrey, England)
Early in April it was noticed that the pair of Casqued Hornbills,
Bycanistes subcylindricus , we had had for two years appeared to be coming
into breeding condition. They spent a lot of time preening and feeding
each other, the cock bird feeding the hen with far more animal food than
usual, this consisting of mice, chicks, meat, etc.
We placed a barrel in the large flight on 29th April taking care to place
the entrance hole to face away from public eyes, and so give as much
privacy to the pair as possible, should they make any attempt to nest.
On 5th May the birds started to mud up the hole in the barrel with some
muddy soil provided by the keepers. The cock bird did most of this
work, with a lot of interest and a little help from his mate. By 15th May
the hole had become very small and excitement of all the staff mounted on
the 17th May, when the hen had become completely sealed in, leaving
only a slit for feeding purposes. It was interesting to note that excrement
also was carefully forced out through this same hole. The nest must
have been spotlessly clean, while the area outside was getting progressively
dirty, but we of course left well alone.
At the end of May and beginning of June we began to get rather worried.
Feeding habits fluctuated violently, in fact on some days little food at all

was taken. On 9th June we offered locusts which seemed to act as an
appetizer and to our relief other food increased, but strangely enough
mice and chicks, not so long ago a favourite food, were now refused
completely; locusts and mince with a little fruit now appeared to be the
order of the day.
On 28th June, 42 days after completion of mudding-up, a baby was
thought to be heard squeaking and on the 29th definitely one chick was
observed through the slit in the hole. Little fruit was now taken, but
locusts, mice, young rats, cut meat and day-old chicks were eaten profusely,
the food intake increasing steadily throughout August.
The cock bird was a very dutiful father. When given a fresh supply
of locusts, it was his habit to immediately take each one up to his mate,
seldom helping himself. In fact August proved a very busy month for
him, for more and more food was demanded by the hen bird, who was
constantly banging on the side of the barrel to attract attention.
On 8th September, to the surprise of us all, during the morning three
beaks were seen at the hole! Imagine the excitement of all at " Bird-
world ". Mum and two chicks were all demanding food from poor father.
The family had now been in the barrel home for four months. We
thought perhaps it was time they were venturing out into the world.
Should we give them a little help by making the hole a little larger? Or
let Nature take its course? My husband sat down one evening and read
all the literature he could find on hornbills, one article read that it was
thought that some of the larger species did in fact stay in their nests as
long as \\ months and so, as the pair had done so well without inter-
ference from us, we decided to leave well alone; which proved a wise
decision. 124 days after the hen was first mudded-in the barrel, on
17th September at first light, two large knocks at the mud and out she
stepped, quite calm and very clean in her new plumage, having gone through
the moult while in the barrel.
The cock bird however was far from being calm, flying from one end
of the flight to the other in great excitement, and to some extent, we felt,
rather frightening the youngsters, who kept putting their heads out of
the hole to see what all the fuss was about but not daring to join the
parents. The first ventured out at 9.32 a.m., the second two hours later
at 11.34 a.m., in rather an undignified manner, just missing the branch his
mate had jumped to and falling like a stone to the ground. It did not
take him many minutes to find his wings and join the rest of the family.
The young birds could fly very well as soon as they left the nest, perfect
miniatures of their parents, with a spotlessly clean black and white plumage
and about three-quarters grown. The nest that they had left was quite
unsoiled and the birds never returned to it.
For the following five to six weeks the parent birds both fed the fast-
growing babies. Now, of course, at three months they are quite self-
supporting. The beaks are still much darker than the older birds and
give the impression that they are both hen birds.

BREEDING THE CRIMSON-RUMPED OR
SUNDEVALL'S WAXBILL AT CHESTER ZOO

<bodyText confidence="0.969401068965517" page_id="56811417"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
(Estrilda rhodopyga)
By William H. Timmis, Curator of Birds and Mammals
The Crimson-rumped or Sundevall's Waxbill is found from the
Central Sudan to Eritrea, Abyssinia and western Somaliland where it is
reported to be quite common locally in small parties, feeding on seeding
grasses and it is said to be extremely tame.
The adult bird is about 3-J- inches in length, mainly brown above, slight
greyish on the head and with crimson on the rump, edge of tail and along
centre of folded wings; a broad crimson stripe runs through the eye;
bill black; face, throat and foreneck white; breast and belly pale brownish-
buff. Finely barred above and below. Two races are recognsied:
E. r. rhodopyga , which is rather paler, and E. r. centralis, this being rather
darker below.
We have found it very difficult to distinguish the male from female,
but it appears that the red through the eyes and on the rump is a much
deeper colour and that the white on the throat is brighter and slightly
wider in the adult male. Three adult Crimson-rumped Waxbills were
purchased from Lady O. C. Baillie on 21st July 1964 and released into
the Tropical House two weeks later. No breeding activity was observed
until the summer of 1968 when a nest was found under a very thick layer
of tropical creeper.
The nest was about two inches from the ground resting on a layer of
dead leaves and grasses which we assumed had been collected by the
breeding birds. The completed nest was quite large, I remember at the
time being astonished at the nest size in relation to the size of the birds.
The nest consisted of grass, feathers, thin shreds of banana leaves, which
I feel must have been shredded by some of the larger birds in free flight
and once discarded this was then collected by the Crimson-rumped
Waxbills. Other materials used included hair, and stems of grass and millet.

26 W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING CRIMSON-RUMPED OR SUNDEVALL's WAXBILL
Eggs were not seen, due to the fact that when the nest was found one
of the birds was sitting and they continued to do so for io days, after which
both birds were seen carrying food into the nest. Food was placed quite
near to the nest area and consisted of soaked seeds, maggots dusted with
Vionate, chopped mealworms and ants-eggs plus seeding and flowering
grasses. I found that they also enjoyed fresh turves each day, also sprouted
millet seed, barley, crushed hemp and dried flies. The crushed hemp
was readily eaten, and the insects also, but not so ravenously, and it did
not seem that insects were essential.
One young bird was seen being fed by one of the parents almost three
weeks after the nest had been found. The parent birds at this stage
were particularly timid and would not approach the nest while being
watched. They were also very excitable, fanning their tails out wide and
switching them from side to side, which was very attractive to watch.
The young bird resembled the adults except that it had no eye stripe and
the bill appeared brownish instead of black and had coloured nodules.
It also had two tufts of downy feathers sticking straight up above the eyes
and no tail feather at all. The young bird was observed on numerous
occasions after leaving the nest and at about three months old it became
very difficult to distinguish it from the adults at a distance.
The Crimson-rumped Waxbills bred again in 1971, this time rearing
two young ones. The nest was almost 10 ft. up on a wide wall overlooking
the Mountain Gorilla enclosure and was built among very thick vegetation.
This year 1972 they again nested in the same area overlooking the
Gorillas and reared two young. I was able to watch this nest through
binoculars and worked out the incubation period at around 12 to 14 days,
the young leaving the nest at 25 days old and returning to the nest each
night for almost a week. Both sexes helped with nest building and it
appeared that the male did most of the construction in the earlier stages;
almost all the larger pieces of nesting materials were found and carried
to the nest site by the male. On three occasions I watched an adult
male Red-billed Weaver (Quelea quelea ) chase the male Crimson-rumped
Waxbill while he was carrying nesting material, once actually taking a long
stem of dried grass from his bill in flight and twice forcing him to land on
the ground which resulted in the Waxbill dropping the grass; it was
immediately picked up by the Red-billed Weaver who then flew to his
small purse-shaped nest and started working on the large entrance at the
side.
We never saw the male Waxbill feeding the female during incubation
but once the eggs had hatched both sexes brooded and fed the young.
Before feeding the young, the birds always settled on their customary
perch and only after they had looked around and noticed nothing unusual
did they fly to the nest. Once again it appeared that the male did more
feeding than the female at least in the early stages. This may be because
the female spent more time brooding and the male was responsible for

feeding the newly hatched chicks. Later, when the chicks were larger
and did not need as much warmth, she then seemed to share the feeding
almost equally as much as the male. One interesting point about the
third nesting was the considerable amount of crushed eggshell and
cuttlefish eaten by the breeding pair both during incubation and in the
rearing stages.
As described above, the Crimson-rumped or Sundevall's Waxbill
(Estrilda rhodopgya) was bred at Chester Zoo in 1968, 1971 and 1972.
It is believed that this may be a first success.

or Abyssinian Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus ), and the Southern

species (Bucorvus cafer). Both species are black in colour with white
primary feathers. The North African ground hornbill inhabits the
savannah land south of the Sahara from Senegal and Sierra Leone in the
west, across Africa through Niger, Chad, Sudan; and Ethiopia, Somali
Republic, Uganda and central Kenya. The southern species is found
living south of the Equator.
Both the northern and southern species have a huge black bill with
patches of red at the base. The area of skin surrounding the eye is bare,
blue in the northern species but red in the southern form. The wattle
on the throat is inflatable, both red and blue in the male. The female
is somewhat smaller in stature with the area around the eye and the
wattle being completely blue. The casque on the head is most unusual
in that it is open in front, and gives the appearance of being broken most
of the time. The presence of the large casque is an excellent distinguishing
feature of the North African form while it is hardly noticeable in the
southern species. The diet of both species is varied to include lizards,
snakes, large insects, small birds and mammals. Much of their lives is

spent on the ground foraging the vegetation for food. They are capable
of flight and their roosting habits are in trees or low bushes in which they
spend their nights.
At the time of this writing the San Diego Wild Animal Park has one
pair of North African ground hornbills in the 125-acre East African exhibit.
The female " Susie " was received at the San Diego Zoological Garden
on 20th September 1961 from Tilburg, and the male " Charlie " was
received at the Zoo on 8th August 1951 from Rotterdam. Both birds were
thought to be adults on arrival. The female was received at the San
Diego Wild Animal Park on 14th September 1970 and the male was
received 24th February 1971. They were introduced to the same area
and were immediately compatible. The individual temperaments of the
birds are almost exactly opposite, with Charlie being a friendly and almost
courageous bird while Susie is of a timid, shy and much reserved nature.
On 20th May 1972 Charlie was observed attempting to feed Susie a
rodent. She accepted the mouse and consumed it after a brief period of
carrying it around in her bill. At every observation for the next few
days both Charlie and Susie were carrying leaves and twigs to an
18-inch diameter drainage pipe situated on the extreme eastern edge of
the exhibit. The female Susie would place the material in the drainage
pipe and appear to stand guard at the entrance. The week of 7th June
1972 was one of inclement weather at the Wild Animal Park. The
drainage pipe which the hornbills had taken over was once again being
used and Charlie and Susie left the area. The next day they were
observed on the opposite side of the exhibit and on the moat line which is
made of earth. They remained in this area almost constantly with the
exception of Charlie who would migrate to the original food station across
the exhibit and return to Susie with food.
On 12th June 1972 Charlie did not come for food. A visual examination
of the moat line showed why. Both he and Susie were laboriously digging
with their bills a cave in the earthen moat wall and a hole was started
about 24 inches above ground level. Once the cave was large enough for
them to enter they incorporated the use of their feet as well. Since it
was obvious that neither he nor Susie were going to leave their labour for
food a new feeding station and a new method of feeding was established.
Their diet which consists of day-old chicks, rodents and small amount of
raw meat chunks was simply placed from afar near the nesting area.
The construction of the cave went on daily until the morning of 23 rd June
1972. Charlie was seen carrying leaves and twigs, and Susie was seen
placing the material in the nest.
On 26th June 1972 mating was observed. It was witnessed only one
time and took place about 200 ft. below the nest area. It was in typical
avian fashion with very little vocalization. Charlie would emit low
booming calls and walk around Susie with his wings partially extended
and his feathers ruffled. He would thump his bill on the ground while

booming. The complete act took about 30 minutes with the actual
mounting being the terminating point.
On 29th June 1972 both birds were observed carrying nesting material
into their cave, with Charlie spending more time inside than out. This
behaviour continued until 12th July 1972 when Susie went inside the
nest and remained. Charlie became more aggressive and protective of
the entire area surrounding the cave.
The cave is about 4 to 4-J ft. in depth with a slight curvature to the left.
The entrance hole is much smaller being about 18 in. in diameter. The
cave opens east and is constructed so that no direct sunlight ever really
enters more than a few inches into the entrance of the nest itself. The
major area of the floor of the cave has been covered with leaves and twigs
in which Susie sits facing the entrance. The earth that was removed
during the actual cave construction has intermingled with rhino dung so
that a ramp has been created from the ground level to the cave entrance.
On 16th July 1972 one off-white egg was observed partially exposed
from under the feathers of Susie's breast. Since she sits facing the
opening, the egg was rather easily seen. On 17th July 1972, a second egg
was observed under Susie. The opening to the nest remained open and
the male continued to feed the female. She did not leave the nest for
food or water.
On 22nd August 1972 movement was observed in the nest and instead
of the two eggs, we observed one chick and one off-white egg. The chick
was hatched naked with eyes closed. The chick's bill is rather enormous
for the body size, being very dark grey (almost black in colour) with a
large egg-tooth in place on the tip. The dark pink skin (almost purple)
covering the body of the chick was textured and closely resembled a
layer of fine grey-white down when first observed. The size of the egg
and the chick was close to that of the domestic turkey ( Meleagrisgallapavo).
The second egg was fertile but was broken open by the female. On
30th August 1972 the second chick, almost full-term, was observed dead
just inside the nest.
The hatching of the North African Ground Hornbill at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park is the second hatching of this rare species ever recorded
in captivity, the first being in Bristol in 1971. This is the first hatching
recorded in the Western Hemisphere.

(Musophaga rossae )
By Newton R. Steel (Stoke Fleming, S. Devon, England)
In October 1968 I was privileged to be the guest of the East African
Guernsey Breeders' Association, during which time I not only judged
cattle at the Nairobi Show, but word had got round that I was exceptionally
interested in birds. Through this, all my hosts and hostesses on the ten
different farms at which I stayed during this time, went out of their way
to show me as much as possible of the bird and wild life of Kenya. It was
whilst staying on a farm at Kitale that I visited a lady who had two pairs
of Ross's Touraco--one of which that year had produced a youngster
which died at some ten days old. I was so attracted by these birds that
I tried hard to buy a pair from her, without success. However I was
going to visit Mr. David Roberts at Lake Baringo so thought I might be
able to obtain them there. There were in fact none available at the time
but he agreed the price and promised to send me a young pair as soon as
they had been hand-reared.
This was subsequently done and one day whilst engaged judging a
Dairy Herds competition in the Surrey area, I received a telegram to say
that some birds were awaiting me at London Airport. The kind lady
who was acting as my chauffeur for this judging engagement, offered to
take me to London Airport to collect them, which we did on this June
afternoon. They arrived each in its own separate compartment with
feeding instructions pasted to the lid and when I got home and unpacked
them, one--which subsequently turned out to be the male--was in
excellent condition, the other looked somewhat dirty and tatty and gave
me some concern for a week or two.
Mealworms were an irresistible temptation and with these in limited
numbers, together with their softbill mixture and soft fruit and ad lib
bathing facilities, they did extremely well in one of my calving boxes on
the farm under infra-red lamps which were thermostatically controlled
to maintain 65*F, then as the summer warmed up and they became
better feathered, this was gradually reduced. They were given an outside
flight which they could use in the daytime only, and here they remained
until I moved to Devonshire in November 1967, where they were housed
for their inside quarters in the cool end of a heated greenhouse, with an
exit to a long 10 ft. flight raised 2 ft. off the ground on wire netting.
They seemed very contented and pleased with their new home which
during the winter was thermostatically controlled to between 45*F and
5o*F. They go into a moult in the early part of the spring each year and
at the end of one of these moults, one June day in 1968, I returned from
the garden to find the hen very severely beaten up about the head, and

down in a corner. So severely was she damaged that a scab grew right
over her head and eyes, thus preventing her from seeing to feed and even
today she still has a naked patch at the back of her neck and one blind
eye, which she unfortunately did herself with one of her long claws when
scratching the irritating scab. I had to force feed her for some ten days
to a fortnight and of course during this time she became very tame.
Her head and eyes were dressed with ointment twice a day and in due
course the scab came off and she re-grew her carmine crest. It was only
then that I realised she was blind in one eye. During this period she
was confined to a segregated section of the indoor aviary so that she should
not fret and here she lived until the moult of 1971 when I thought it was
really time that I tried to get them together again.
This I did in short periods of re-introduction when I was close by for
an hour or two. One day to my delight I saw them feeding one another.
I hurriedly spent a whole afternoon erecting a large tree log in the far
end of the flight, up against a south facing wall, hoping that this might
be a suitable home for them but no, they took no notice of it whatsoever
but preferred to carry very stupid pieces of stick on to some dangerously
insecure branches in the greenhouse. I endeavoured to help them by
putting some flat, dry laurel branches and leaves horizontally, but for all
their industrious stick carrying, everything fell down to the ground again.
I then wove in a piece of wire netting upon which I thought they could
lay their sticks more securely, when one day to my horror I found a
broken egg on the floor. It had rolled off this very insecure platform.
This was 1 6th June 1971.
My next attempt was to commandeer the only suitable shopping basket
and promptly remove the bottom of it. leaving a rim of about an inch all
round. The bottoms of shopping baskets, as you may know, are more
often convex than concave, so I had to make my nest-basket concave and
this was done by pressing it into an earthenware pigeon nest pan, putting
in the middle of it some extremely heavy bricks and filling the pan with
boiling water. When it had cooled off I found the canes had set in a
concave fashion and I then wired this on to the top of the wire-netting.
An old green sunblind protects the nest from direct rays of the sun or
cold radiation from the glass. The nest is 6 ft. from the floor. Every
time I approached the nesting-site to give any help at all, I was attacked
by both birds so the only safe means was to keep them out in the flight
while I performed the house building. This complete, I replaced the
broken egg with a similar size bantam egg.
i8i th June 1971
They took to it and the following day a second egg was laid and then
a third, so I removed the bantam's egg. This was the only occasion the
clutch was more than two. Not having any idea how long they would
brood, I left well alone, but on the 7th July one egg was missing. No

sign of it anywhere. I felt sure it had been eaten. After this they were
less and less concerned, although they continued to sit for a day or two.
I subsequently examined the second egg only to find it infertile so removed
it.

Another egg appeared and a second one on the 27th.
2&quot;jth July
These were again religiously incubated by the cock bird sitting from
about 10 o'clock during the day and the hen bird from tea-time until the
middle of the following morning. The eggs are almost completely round,
rather like those of an owl and 43 mm. x 36 mm. with no small end.
They sat continuously for four weeks. When I removed the two eggs
I found that one had a well-formed but decomposing chick in it. The
head was well-formed and eyes visible, and there were black feathers down
the neck and on the shoulders so it had obviously died just prior to hatching.
With this I decided it was quite late enough, so removed the nest for the
rest of the year. They went into their usual moult at the end of February/
March 1972 and at the end of March I replaced the basket nest.
9 th and 11th April 1972
This they were delighted to see and on the 9th April the first egg was
laid, the second on the nth April. They shared the incubation period
again for nearly four weeks but again both eggs proved infertile.
19 th May
Again they went to nest on the 19th May, this time not sitting quite so
well as in the past, and after three weeks I tested the eggs and found them
both infertile so I removed them.
28 th and 30 th June
Once again on the 28th June another egg appeared and a second on
the 30th June. This time they sat well and on the 23rd July, just 24 days
after, the second egg hatched and the little black chick, looking almost
exactly like a young Moorhen, was sitting with its head up in the nest.
But this was found dead on the floor at four days old. I removed the
other egg which was infertile. This was a great disappointment. During
this time I had been feeding them all their usual cut-up mixed fruit,
together with an insectivorous mixture and mealworms, but obviously it
was not sufficient.
12 th and 14 th August , and 8 th September
However to my delight they went to nest again, the first egg was laid
on the 12th August and the second on the 14th August. The first egg

was hatched on the 8th September. I left the second egg in the nest
for support.
During the incubation period I had started to feed the parents with an
occasional sop of bread and milk. This they became very fond of and
when the chick hatched, they had a regular feed out of my hand of bread
and milk twice a day, ten or a dozen mealworms three times a day, and
what I believe has been the main reason for success in rearing this chick,
in place of water I substituted nectar feed. Other than their bath out
in the flight, they have never been offered water up to the present time.
They consume a cupfull of nectar a day, and the chick, now six weeks old,
has been seen down at it. Mealworms were increased from 12-15 to
20-25 and they are now taking 100 a day. I have no doubt they would
take more but I feel that these, with the bread and milk and nectar,
should be adequate.
They have been consuming in the last two or three weeks the equivalent
of half a slice ofbread cut at an inch thick, soaked with milk overnight and
sugar sprinkled on the top and, in addition to this, a very concentrated
powder with a very high protein content. Half a teaspoonful of this has
been sprinkled on both feeds of bread and milk, as well as on the meal-
worms. Gentles have been offered, but are not readily taken, except
when fed before mealworms and if they are very clean and lively, then the
odd one seems to be eaten. Feeding is by regurgitation. Not as with
pigeons where the young put their beaks into the parents, but by the young
opening a large gape and its parent dribbling food into the open mouth.
Far less of the fruit and insectivorous mixture is taken. In fact for the
first week or two hardly any, other than orange and grapes. Even pear
did not seem to be appreciated.
At the time of writing on the 26th October, the chick has been out
and about for nearly a fortnight. It was interesting to note that at first
the chick was found down on the floor, where it remained for four
days despite my thinking it was kind to return it to the nest, but after
four days it returned to the nest of its own accord and continued to be
brooded there at night.
Since it came out of the nest, I have endeavoured to maintain a tempera-
ture of 6o*F by means of an electric radiator. The chick is now well
feathered and the blue sheen shows on the wings and tail, but as yet the
lovely carmine of the secondaries is not visible. The bill and wattle and
ceres are still quite black. It will be interesting to see how long before
they change colour. It is now about the size of a pigeon.
For those who have not been so fortunate as to know that they have a
pair, the difference between the male and female is that in the male, the
caque, or wattle, is very slightly concave and when really fit has a little
red mark in the centre, whilst that of the female is convex (i.e. Roman-
nosed) and has no red marking. One of the interesting features of the
birds is that they very much resent any change in one's appearance.

Normally I never wear a hat or glasses when I am feeding them but should
I inadvertently do so, I am attacked viciously. Apart from this they are
most friendly, will take mealworms or bread and milk out of my hand, and
always seem pleased to see me. I believe it is advisable, particularly
during the hot summer, to let them have a bath available during incubation
and should this be done, I think it is essential that it is there all the time
so that each parent may bathe when it pleases, because on one occasion
when I had withheld the bath for a period, both parents came off the
nest and got thoroughly soaked and then sat in the sun drying themselves.
As with so many birds, I find that they only bathe in fresh, clean water-
in other words they will not go into a dirty bath.
The floor covering of the inside aviary is coarse sand, which I feel
advisable as it is easily cleaned out, they being rather messy birds under-
neath their perch. For safety's sake I keep them off the earth. Visitors
are something which I never let them have during the incubation period
because they are much too agitated and omit their delightful liquid
warbling cry. I do feel that it is inadvisable to encourage their nesting
outside, especially in view of the length of time they sit and the lateness
in the year for a chick to be out.

Glorious sunny day; father taught baby to have a bath. Incidentally
three days ago he turned on the hen and scalped her unmercifully; she
has been removed for treatment and is recovering. He maintains close
watch over the chick which now feeds itself regularly.
As described above Ross's Touraco Musophaga rossae has been bred

NEW WALKTHROUGH RAINFOREST AVIARY
AT THE TARONGA ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976040485714286" page_id="56811433"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Kerry A. Muller (Curator of Birds, Taronga Zoological Park,
Sydney, N.S.W., Australia)
The concept of large walkthrough aviaries is certainly not new in zoos,
and the majority of first-class zoos in Europe and America have exhibited
such aviaries for at least the last decade, some being constructed at the
turn of the century.
The Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary in Healsville, Victoria, was the first
Australian Zoo to build a large walkthrough aviary. This houses a
breeding pair of Superb Lyrebirds. They have recently completed a
second similar aviary and a large bird-of-prey aviary.
On 3rd February 1972 the New Walkthrough Rainforest Aviary was
opened at the Taronga Zoo. In dimensions it stands 122 ft. long, 70 ft.
wide and 60 ft. high, being oval in design.
Architecturally it is unique, the entire aviary being supported by two
inclined steel parabolic arches. These arches are further supported by
interlacing cables of 8 mm. diameter, stainless steel wire ropes and
8 mm. diameter high tensile stainless steel rods, strung to form a grid.
Both the arches and cables are bolted into a concrete perimeter foundation.
The aviary cover is of 25 mm. (1 in.) by 12 mm. (J in.) galvanized weld-
mesh, tightly secured to the cables and the cement foundation. This size
mesh contains all bird species, including Malurus wrens, and prohibits
the entry of pests such as sparrows, starlings and rats. A guiding
principle in the design of the aviary was to create an enclosed space with
no acute angles, no crossbeams or upright supports, either inside or out.
The entire space is available for unobstructed flight (in this we are
fortunate in not having to consider problems of snow or ice loads.)
Entry and exit for the public is permitted at either end by a revolving
door, consisting of three panels set at 120* and permitting the access of
strollers (or perambulators) into the aviary. The vertical edges of these
panels are lined with heavy rubber strips to prevent escape of birds and
injuries to the visitors.
Within the aviary visitors are confined to a wide natural wood walkway.
Wherever possible this is raised above the ground, thus preventing
visitors from leaving the walkway and allowing birds access under

the walkway from one area to another. The area under the walkway
is heavily planted, and provides additional security and nesting areas for
the birds. In areas where the walkway approaches ground an incon-
spicuous barrier of sharp upturned tree-roots has been provided, upon
which vines and epiphytes are growing. This device has proved very I
satisfactory in confining visitors to the walkway and it has not been
necessary, as in many zoos, to employ a keeper or guard on patrol during
visiting hours. No visitors have yet been observed off the walkway.
Landscaping the aviary in a simulated rainforest was a major under-
taking. The site has an undulating slope, in some areas exceeding 45 0 ,
with a substrate of sandstone, in some areas forming attractive outcropping
shelves. Initially all old soil, rubble and vegetation were removed from
the site, retaining only an Umbrella Tree ( Brassaia) and a badly cropped
Paperbark ( Melaleuca ). New soil rich in leaf mould was added, in some
areas contained by low stone retaining walls. Trees for perching were
cut and set in concrete filled holes. To provide a composit rainforest
effect similar to those found in eastern Australia, the following indigenous
species were used in landscaping

hildebrandiana ), Cape Honeysuckle ( Tecoma capensis ), Asparagus Fern
(Asparagus sprengeri ), Wandering Jew (Tradescantia fluminensis), Begonias
and Bromeliads.
A series of small pools and connected streams were established in the
aviary, often adjacent to the walkway. Contours were shaped in the soil
and lined with butyl rubber. Sand and river gravel were added to cover
the rubber and give a natural appearance, and the pools planted with
native lillies and rushes. Small fish, amphibians and tortoises were then
added to complete the illusion of naturalness (much to the delight of our
Kingfishers).
Water is a major necessity of any rainforest, and this is provided by
four oscillating sprinklers located inconspicuously on the steel arches above
the vegetation. On the ground a series of mist-producing heads are
connected to a copper water line buried in the soil. To water the exhibit
a keeper need only turn on a series of valves and return to other duties.
On hot days the overhead sprinklers are often turned on, to the mutual
enjoyment of birds and visitors.
To prevent erosion and to provide a natural substrate, leafmould and
dry leaves were used to cover the forest floor. These rapidly decomposed
and provide food for insects and earthworms, which are in turn consumed
by the birds, especially the Lyrebirds.
Food for the wide variety of birds is provided in several feeding stations,
and changed once or twice daily. Stainless steel pans are placed in move-
able holders, both at ground level and above ground dependent on the
birds' feeding habits. These holders are fitted with circular transparent
perspex plastic domes, placed 12 ins. above the pan. These keep all rain
and water out of the feed but are unobtrusive in appearance. For nectar
feeders several bottles are provided on holders in trees throughout the
cage. For fruit-eater birds several dead perches have a series of stainless
steel headless nails imbedded in them, and pieces of apple, orange, banana
and papaya are impaled on them daily and old fruit removed.
In stocking the new aviary, emphasis was placed on Australasian species
inhabiting rainforest habitats. One reason for this is that the area of
the zoo in which the aviary is built is dedicated to native fauna and flora.
Another reason is that importation of any birds into Australia has been
forbidden by law since 1948, and exotic bird species are difficult (or
impossible) to obtain.
Labels were made identifying the birds presented, and defining the
relationship and adaptations of different families of birds to particular
ecological niches in a rainforest. It is our eventual aim to represent as
many families as possible in the aviary.
The following species are presently exhibited in the rainforest aviary:
Banded Landrail (Rallus philippensis ), Torres Strait Pigeon ( Ducula
spilorrhoa), Top-knot Pigeon ( Lopholaimus antarcticus ), White-headed
Pigeon ( Columba norfolciensis ), Luzon Bleeding-heart Pigeon ( Gallicolumba

walkway. Efforts were made to avoid initial overstocking, allowing for
later plant growth to provide additional cover. Within the next few
months pittas, treecreepers, sunbirds, log-runners, cuckoos, parrot-finches
and small lorikeets will be added to the aviary.
One of the greatest of all aviculturists and ornithologists, Jean Delacour,
once wrote " The principle of a walk-in cage is excellent, and I can claim
to be the sponsor of such aviaries in America, where they have proved
highly satisfactory. But its very principle is that the cage itself is not
obvious, so that the visitor who is inside has as much as possible the
illusion of walking among free birds. The frame of the aviary must not
only be simple and inconspicuous, but also made invisible by trees and
creepers. Even its approach should be so planted on the outside that one
is not aware that there is a cage at all."
We feel that in design and landscaping our new rainforest aviary meets
these criteria admirably.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
On two recent visits to the London Zoo on mild, dull December days
I was surprised at the activity of some of the fruit pigeons. This included
a display apparently not described previously, and I have therefore
published these notes. The accompanying sketches are reconstructions
at a later date based on hasty scrawls on the backs of envelopes or any
paper that came to hand in my pockets. They are not accurate as regards
detail but may help to give a general impression of the postures.
The display was that of the Grey-necked Fruit Pigeon, Ducula caroli.
There were two birds, which Derek Goodwin tells me are two males,
about the size of domestic pigeons but more stoutly built in typical fruit
pigeon fashion. They are mainly grey with dark spots on the wings and
a greenish tail. The upper breast is pale silvery-grey and the lower breast
a darker shade of grey, the two separated by a transverse line and giving
an illusion of shadow on a sunlit bird. Towards the sides of the breast a
white line separating the two areas is visible. The belly and under tail
converts are a dark purplish-brown.
The displaying bird drew itself upright on the perch, very tall and thin,
and blew out its chest as a two-tone grey balloon, rather in the fashion of
a pouter pigeon. At the same time it extended its neck forward and bowed
the head until the neck rested on top of the inflated breast with the head
pressed down against the upper breast and the bill pressed into the
feathers (fig. i). The legs were stretched and the tail pointed downwards.
In this posture it uttered a series of low-pitched " oomp " notes, about
eleven notes in rapid succession, beginning emphatically and becoming
more rapid and lower in pitch, and dying away. I can only describe the
general tone as similar to that heard when air rapidly bubbles out of a
submerged pint milk-bottle--a sound most washers-up may recall.
The bird repeated the performance twice.
It then turned slightly towards its companion who stood in an upright,
alert posture nearly. The displaying bird retained its very rigid upright
stance with lowered head, but by flexing its legs slightly performed a
series of vigorous upward jerks, very like those occurring in the display
of some estrildines. Having done six or seven of these it relaxed a little,
raising its head and uttering a small harsh note; after which it returned to
a more normal posture. The very upright posture was of interest because
this species is one with a conspicuously patterned underside.

C. J. 0 . HARRISON--DISPLAY AND POSTURES OF FRUIT PIGEONS
On the same visits I watched a Mountain Imperial Pigeon, Ducula badia ,
perform calling and nest-calling in a nearby aviary. The commencement
of this was indicated by the bird extending head and neck forwards and
upwards with the feathers of the head slightly fluffed and the throat partly
inflated (fig. 2). This was followed by an arching forwards and downwards
of head and neck accompanied by a puffing-out of the breast, resulting in
a hunched posture with the head pressed against the front of a swollen
breast and the bill almost buried in the feathers fig. 3). In this posture

the bird uttered four well-spaced, deep notes, the first two rather short
and more rapid, the second pair longer and almost disyllabic " wook-wook,
urwook, urwook ". This was immediately followed by an abrupt upward
swing of the head back to a more normal position above the back
terminating in a slight backward pressing of the head and outward thrust
of the breast. The same pattern was witnessed several times.
This individual was also seen nest-calling on two different occasions.
It squatted on top of a closely-clipped privet hedge. Its tail was not
noticeably raised and there was no marked wing-twitching, only an
occasionally slight tremor of the wings. Small twigs were picked up and
placed to either side by the bird. Periodically it would call. There was
the same arching of the neck and pressing of the deeply-lowered head
against the inflated breast. The call was only two monosyllabic notes
" wook, wook " and then the head was abruptly raised again in typical
fashion.
I had also seen this type of call with deeply-lowered head from an
Australian Pied Imperial Pigeon, Ducula spilorrhoa , at Amsterdam Zoo
in 1970. In this case the posture of the calling bird was almost horizontal.
The bird squatted on a perch, lowered its head to the front of the breast
with bill pressed against the feathers. It uttered what I noted at the time
as a deep, hollow " crool, coo-rool ". It also gave a briefer " kut-crool "
note.
In this last species I noted one individual standing on a possible nest-
site, tilted forwards with tail straight up and breast and bill almost touching
the site. Its wings were rhythmically quivering but I could not hear a
call at the time. I also noted one bird threatening another by moving in
short hops towards it with head low and neck extended forwards, and
uttering an abrupt " check " or " chuck " note, loud and nasal, and more
like that of a rail than a pigeon. This last note appears similar to that
recorded by Derek Goodwin (Pigeons and Doves of the world, 1967; p. 420)
for the Indonesian Pied Imperial Pigeon, D. hicolor.

On January 3 1973, I observed copulation in a pair of Mountain
Imperial Pigeons, Ducula badia , at the London Zoo. Although this was

seen only once it seems worth publishing here, partly so that it can form
an appendage to Dr. Harrison's observations on Ducula species, and
partly because I know of no other observation on any species of the
Ducula IPtilinopus group. The copulation ceremonials of pigeon species,
although sometimes variable in minor details, are usually species-specific
(Goodwin 1956, 1970) so that even if only one such has been seen it is
highly likely to fall within the species' normal repertoire and quite likely
to be entirely typical.
Shortly after cooing (see Harrison preceding article pp. 39-41) the male
flew down, slighted on a low perch and at once displacement-preened at the
side of his breast. The female, on seeing this, immediately flew down also
and alighted about two feet from him. As she did so he displacement-
preened once behing his wing. She sidled a little towards him, then
adopted a soliciting posture which differed from that of other pigeons
known to me in that her neck was elongated and curved slightly downwards.
For some moments the male stood beside her in an indecisive manner.
Then he raised his head, slightly swelled out his neck (inflation or plumage
erection?), then mounted the female. He remained for some time, perhaps
only half a minute but it seemed longer, quiescent on her back. Once
during this period he head flicked, usually a gesture of irritation or
repulsion (Goodwin 1956 b). Then he began simultaneously to coo and

to manoeuvre backwards to copulate. I had the impression that the
actual cloacal contact coincided with the end of the cooing phrase, and the
backward movement of the head as described by Harrison.
The male dismounted onto the perch at the same side of the female from
which he had previously mounted. He lifted his head high, the female
turned eagerly towards him and reached up with her bill. The male
offered his bill, opening his gape widely. The female inserted her bill
and with it inside the male's rapidly opened and shut her bill with a
vibrating movement of the head. The male did the same (except that
his bill was, perforce, widely open at the time) with his bill. There was
no passage of food or other matter between them. They separated, then
immediately repeated this billing, after which the mating ceremony
appeared to be at an end.
Mountain Imperial Pigeon. Post-copulatory billing.
If this instance was typical its most noticeable difference from that of
such other pigeons whose mating ceremonies have been described was the
occurrence of billing after instead of before copulation. The rapid
opening and shutting of the mandibles is similar to what I have seen from
the African Green Pigeon, Treron calva , and the Green Imperial Pigeon,
Ducula aenea , on the nest site and which is possibly their equivalent of the
nodding of Columba species. Cooing while on the female's back occurs in
the copulation ceremonial of the Diamond Dove and some of the
Australasian bronzewings (Goodwin i960).

OBSERVING THE HABITS OF FOREIGN
DOVES IN CAPTIVITY

<bodyText confidence="0.977376846153846" page_id="56811442"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California, U.S.A.)
What has interested, indeed fascinated, me more than any other factor
in enjoying foreign doves and pigeons in captivity is their individual habits
as manifested in their day-to-day behavoir, particularly in relation to the
habits of domestic doves and pigeons. In this essay I plan to emphasize
distinctive behavior traits of species of foreign doves and pigeons which
it has been my good fortune to maintain over extended periods of time
in my aviary.
In appraising the value of my observations, the reader should remember
that no two doves or pigeons, even those belonging to the same species,
behave necessarily in the same manner. This behavior may be conditioned
by many factors, over most of which their keeper has little or no control.
They may include the following: whether or not the doves were raised in
their native haunts or in captivity; how long they have been in captivity
and how well they have adjusted to its limitations; whether they are kept
under highly artificial or more or less natural conditions, and, of course,
how carefully and humanely they are treated by their keeper. All these
considerations, and many others, affect their behavior in captivity very
much.
One of the most typical doves for study, not only from the standpoint
of behavior but also from that of appearance is the Galapagos Dove.
It made its first appearance in captivity in 1893 when four specimens
arrived at the London, England, Zoo, and in 1923 at the New York Zoo.
This small, short, plump bird looks neither like a dove nor pigeon, and is
in this respect unique among foreign doves. I well remember the first
pair I acquired quite some years ago. Almost the very moment I released

male and female into a planted aviary, containing a mixed lot of doves
and softbills, they made themselves completely at home. At once they
began to investigate the aviary from corner to corner, the feed dishes and
the nestboxes, without in any way disturbing the other inmates of the
aviary. Best of all, they were wholly unafraid of me, acting as if simply
I belonged with them in the aviary. Their curiosity next centered on the
aviary soil, which soon they punctured vigorously with their fairly long,
curved beaks, apparently searching for beetles and grubs in the numerous
holes they dug all over the aviary floor. This habit of probing the soil
for nourishment is a distinct behavior trait of the Galapagos Dove, one I
have not observed in any of the other species of foreign doves I have kept.
Moreover, my pair lost no time in locating an open-front nestbox, soon
thereafter building a flimsy nest with sticks and straws, and in due course
raising young successfully. During their sojourn in my aviary, these
unusual " undovelike " doves proved tame and trusting, wholly unafraid
of me, and attending to their affairs without in any way bothering their
neighbors.
The most notable behavior trait of the Snow Pigeons I once kept was
their delightful liveliness: their flying and chasing about in the aviary,
time and time again jumping in and out of the large, open-top nesting box,
the while voicing their " clucks and croaks " in a very determined effort
to coax a suitable mate to join them. Filled with overflowing energy,
these handsome pigeons were " on the go and fly " seemingly the whole
day long, and in this behavior strongly suggested that of certain varieties
of domestic pigeons. So deeply absorbed were they in their goings and
comings as to pay virtually no attention to me when I entered their
private abode to feed and water them. That they were closely related to
domestic columbae was shown by their eagerness to mate with blue
Strasser Pigeons, there being no female Snow Pigeons available.
Among the gentlest " wild " pigeons I have ever had in my aviary was
a trio of freshly imported Splendid Pigeons--two hens and one cock.
This quite handsome threesome lived peacefully together during all the
years they were in my possession. Even after mating and producing some
offspring, old and young flourished without showing the slightest tendency
toward disagreement. On the basis of this rather unpigeonlike behavior
of freshly imported birds, I assumed that this species lived and nested in
flocks in its native habitat, as is the custom of certain wild species of
pigeons.
A lovely pair of Bartailed Cuckoo Doves deserve mention also owing to
their almost astounding prolificness during the four years they have been
mine. Always using the same nesting site in the half-dark of their
private aviary, they have invariably brooded the single white egg faithfully,
hatched it in 13 days, and nursed the squab to vigorous maturity. Their
alertness when brooding amuses me, since it manifests itself only in the
lifting of the head over the nest's edge as if to say, " please, don't come

closer, just leave me to my private business! " These beautiful long-
tailed birds' behavior is characterized by seemingly day-long masterly
inactivity, spent on the same high perch or else on the nest. Perhaps that
is the main reason why in antique records they were considered being
so-called " tree pigeons ". Even though for the last two seasons their eggs
have lacked fertility, the pair continues to lay them month in and month
out, even during the winter months--truly an interesting couple!
And now a few words concerning a pair of Key West Quail Doves, which
have graced a part of my aviary for the last seven years, raising many a
youngster, but currently laying only infertile eggs. Their characteristic
behavior trait lies in their sitting on the nest close together side by side
not only at the time of " changing the guards, " but literally for hours on
end as if both male and female were determined to see the eggs hatch!
Since they do not, or cannot, " sense " the infertility of their eggs, they
usually continue to brood for 12-13 days. And though I have followed
the well-meant advice of a friendly, concerned veterinary, giving them
epsom salts, special vitamins, and what not, I an unable to effect a' ' cure, "
probably because the doves are too old to reproduce, so I just have to let
them sit side by side and " enjoy" themselves! They are among my
pensioners that have served me well in bygone years, therefore deserving
of rest and quiet.
In conclusion, a brief mention of a pair of Bartlett Bleeding Heart doves
which have been my possession for well over a year. Their behavior
during all these months is marked by almost constant restlessness and
shyness, which no doubt is responsible for their reluctance to nest.
They live in a private compartment, wholly undisturbed by other doves
and thoroughly well protected against outside enemies. Though I keep
my distance when feeding them, they at once begin to run about wildly,
certainly sore afraid of me. Such reactions are new to me, especially
when they signify no change for the better in more than twelve months.
My explanation of this undesirable behavior is that somehow or other they
were not accorded the proper treatment by their former owner. However,
they are a beautiful pair, not at all common in this country; so I shall
continue to care for them hoping against hope that they will in due time
change their behavior and " reform. "

A pair of Ostriches at Longleat Safari Park laid a number of eggs
and Mr. Roger Cawley, the Manager, kindly asked us if we would like
to try our hand at hatching them, so they were placed in an incubator.
Altogether six eggs were sent to us over a period of several weeks.
Three proved to be infertile two developed chicks which failed to hatch,
the remaining one did hatch and the chick survived for three weeks,
eventually dying of Aspergillosis.
Details are as follows:
The temperature of the incubator was kept at 98*F for five weeks and
ioo*F for the last week. The eggs themselves were laid on moist sand
and turned every morning and evening. Examination over a strong light
showed that at 41 days the chick had penetrated the air sac within the egg;
at 42 days it was tapping the shell; on the 43rd day the chick hatched
with some assistance from our keeper, Martin Greene, who made a small
hole in the shell at the end containing the air sac to enable the chick
to breathe. This it could be heard doing quite clearly.
Hatching occured on the 8th July 1972. For the first three days the
chick did little. It neither ate nor drank and was very weak on it's legs.
At the end of this time it began to walk properly and was transferred to a
pen indoors over which was suspended an infra red lamp. It then began
to peck at clover and chopped grass. On the nth July it took half grown
locusts and was seen to drink for the first time. On the 14th July it was
seen to take grit in the form of a mixture of flint, oyster shell and limestone.
On the 15th July it was put out on short grass during sunny periods and
it began to eat turkey pellets. On the 16th July it was grazing and eating
pellets well.
From this time onwards it began to grow and seemed to be doing well,
but on the 29th July it died. It was of course shut in at night and at all
times had access to the infra red lamp during dull sunless periods in the
daytime.
It should also be recorded that Woburn and Windsor Safari Parks
kindly sent us eggs laid by their Ostriches, but unfortunately all were
unfertile.

BREEDING OF THE VICTORIA CROWNED
PIGEON GOURA VICTORIA AT BRISTOL ZOO

Michael Sherborne (Overseer of Birds, Zoological Gardens, Bristol
England)
During 1972 a Victoria Crowned Pigeon (Goura victoria) was hatched
and reared at Bristol Zoo, which we believe is the first breeding of this
species in Britain.
The cock bird has been in the collection since 1968 and a hen was
acquired in February 1971. They have been part of a mixed collection
in the walk-through tropical bird house since October 1971. Other species
exhibited here include Rothschild's Mynahs, Nicobar Pigeons, Wood-
peckers, Plovers, Broadbills, Hanging Parrots, Hoopoes and small
insectivorous species.
Mating began in the middle of December and a few days later the birds
started building a nest in an artificial tree in the centre of the public
walking area. The nest was typical of pigeons, an untidy heap of sticks
about 18 inches across and it was 14 feet above ground level. The first
egg was laid on nth March from a branch outside the nest and it broke
on the floor below. Another was laid on 6th May but there was no sign
of hatching after the incubation period of 28 days. We left it for a few
days longer but it was stolen before we could check if it had been fertile.
A third egg was laid during June and was removed, addled, after the
incubation time. The fourth egg, laid in August hatched on nth
September.
The parent's food consisted of insectile mixture with chopped fruit, cut
maize, wheat and turkey breeders' pellets. They also had free access to
livefood (maggots and mealworms). Both fed the chick until it left the
nest on nth October and for several weeks afterwards. It feathered
quite quickly and for a few days before it left the nest it would stand on
the edge flapping its wings, looking an exact miniature replica of the
parents except for the less well-developed crest. In about 10 weeks it
was as large as the parents. The only visual difference in the sexes appears
to be in size and as far as we can ascertain the youngster is a hen
As described above the Victoria Crowned Pigeon (Goura victoria) has
been bred at Bristol Zoo. It is believed this is a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the
Assistant Editor.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
The Horned Sungem, Heliactin cornuta, is found in central and eastern
Brazil. The species is rarely seen in captivity, indeed at the time of
writing, I believe the male in my collection to be the only one in this
country and probably in Europe. P. H. Hastings brought a number of
these birds in during the summer of 1957 and has, I believe, imported
only the occasional one or two since then (Hastings, 1969). M. W.
Clifford imported two males during the spring of 1971.
One of the males imported by Clifford went to a collection in the north
of England; it was an adult. This bird died during the latter part of 1971
due to a number of abcesses forming in and around the bill. The other
male, which was immature, I purchased.
Adult males are approximately \\ in. overall length. As if in. is taken
up with the tail feathers and a further J in. by the bill, it can be seen that
the Sungem is one of the smallest of the Trochilidae if the bodysize only
is taken into account. I have read that if the tail were taken away,
H. cornuta could be compared to the smallest of birds, the Bee Humming-
bird, Calypte helenae (Greenewalt, i960). Not having seen a live specimen
of the latter, I am not in a position to argue. I would point out, however,
that the Reddish Hermit, Phaethornis ruber , is certainly smaller bodywise
than the Sungem.
The adult male Horned Sungem has upper parts of shining greenish
gold which reflect a coppery sheen in certain lights. Sides of head are
velvety black which is carried on to the throat and terminates in two
points on the upper breast. Occasionally these feathers (hereafter
referred to as the beard) merge into a single point. The sides of the neck
and upper breast are pure white, these feathers forming a ruff thus
highlighting the velvety black beard. Lower breast and belly are also
white, but as these feathers are not so dense as those which form the ruff,
they do not have the intense whiteness of the latter. The crown is
glittering dark blue, at the sides of which are iridescent tufts (hereafter
referred to as horns), which are glittering golden green turning to
glittering ruby red at the base. In certain lights these horns appear blue
except for the base which always appears as ruby red. The tail feathers
are narrow, pointed and much graduated. The central pair being shining
dark green and the remainder white with the outer edge green. At no
time is the tail held in a forked position; I mention this having seen
illustrations depicting the species with a forked tail.
Females are very much like the males, but lack the glittering feathers
on the crown and the black beard. Also the outer tail feathers have a
black oblique band near the base.

A. J. MOBBS--THE HORNED SUNGEM HUMMINGBIRD
As already mentioned, the male I have in my collection was in immature
plumage at the time of purchase. It was very much like a female in appear-
ance except for a thin line of glittering blue feathers along the centre of the
crown and a few black feathers on the upper throat. The blue feathers
are erectile in the adult; in the immature bird they were small and
insignificant. Like the female, the immature male had an oblique black
band near the base of the outer tail feathers. The two central feathers
were shining dark green, but in the immature bird they were broader and
not so long as in the adult.
I purchased the Sungem on 21st May 1971. Other than being some-
what fatigued after the long journey from Brazil, the bird was in excellent
health and the following morning, after a good night's rest, was in excellent
spirits. In fact as soon as the birdroom lights were turned on, the bird
commenced to sing most exuberantly.
I believe this bird may have been moulting at the time of purchase,
but it was not until 23rd June, that I noticed feathers being shed in any
number and then it was breast feathers only which were found in the
bird's cage. It was another month before any flight feathers were shed.
Shortly after this, the bird commenced to moult in earnest and each week
a little more of the black beard appeared. Half the flight-feathers had
been renewed before any tail feathers were shed. The black and white
outer feathers were the first to go and it was 27th November, before the
two central green feathers were dropped.
The iridescent feathers on the crown and the horns are of course the
outstanding feature of this species and as there was no sign of these coming
through until the beginning of November, I had by then begun to despair
of ever seeing my bird with horns. However, on the same day as the
central tail feathers were dropped, I wrote in my diary " The horns are
at last showing on the Sungem! ".
As can be seen, the moult from immature to adult plumage was an
exceptionally slow process, especially for a hummingbird and it was
14th January 1972, before it was finally completed. Exactly 34 weeks!
Perhaps I should point out that although this was an exceptionally slow
moult, the bird was in excellent health throughout and when it did
eventually attain adult plumage, it was feather perfect. It will now prove
interesting to see how long it takes the Sungem to complete a normal
annual moult.
I have found the Horned Sungem to be one of the most robust of the
smaller hummingbirds; it is also one of the most vocal. It is rare indeed
for me to enter the birdroom and not hear this bird singing, in fact from
first light until approximately 7 p. m., it is rarely silent. The song
consists of an oft repeated chittering note terminated with a loud chirring
note which is repeated three or four times. This song is sung both on
the wing and when the bird is at rest. In both cases it is uttered almost
continuously with a break of only a second or two in between each phase.

A, J. MOBBS--THE HORNED SUNGEM HUMMINGBIRD
5 1
As well as the song, the Sungem will on occasions utter a loud " twitting "
note. This is heard especially when the bird is inspecting a strange
object, or when alarmed. Perhaps I should add that this note seems to
be used only when the bird is on the wing.
As with most of my tiny hummers, the Sungem is housed in a cage on
its own. The cage front is i in. by \ in. welded mesh, painted black.
There are two doors cut into the mesh, each y in. by 6 in. To prevent
injury to my hands and to the bird, black adhesive tape surrounds each
opening. I mention this because the Sungem often displays to this tape.
It will also on occasions display to one of the perches in its cage. When
displaying to the tape, the bird moves from side to side on rapidly beating
wings, uttering the chittering notes used in the normal type song. The
bird often hovers in front of the tape, touching it with the tip of its bill,
after which the body is moved up and down and from side to side very
rapidly. When the bird directs its display at the perch, it is very much
the same as when directed at the tape, except that the bird moves from
side to side in an arch instead of in an almost straight line. As well as
performing the rapid movements already mentioned, the bird will occa-
sionally hover directly above the perch, touching it with its bill and
extended beard feathers, after which the bird alights and goes through
the actions of mating. Throughout the display procedure the beard is
extended, but at no time have I seen the horns spread. This is rather
surprising as I should have thought these feathers would be used during
the display even more so than the black beard.
The iridescent head feathers and the horns can be erected slightly;
many hummingbird species are able to erect their head feathers, however,
so this is not at all uncommon. When the Sungem preens its wing butts
or scratches its head, the horns do appear to be fanned slightly. Whether
the bird can do this at will or during certain preening postures only,
I am unable to determine.
At the time of purchase, I fed the Sungem a mixture of Super Hydramin
and sugar. After a week on this mixture, I persuaded the bird to take
the diet I usually feed hummingbirds, namely equal parts Stimulite nectar
paste and clear honey. I would not call this bird highly insectivorous,
however, it does take around fifteen to twenty fruit-flies each day.
These flies are taken from either the sides of the cage or from the wire
mesh front. The bird takes hold of a fly with the tip of its bill, tosses the
fly in the air and catches it w r ith gaping bill, then swallows it all in one
deft movement. At no time have I observed the Sungem hawking flies.
I have noticed the bird prefers the smaller fruit-flies, large one's being
left strictly alone. If the Sungem accidently drops a fly it has caught, it
will pick it from the floor of the cage, toss it in the air and then swallow it.
The Sungem prefers a shallow saucer of water in which to bathe and
takes at least one bath each day. Compared to many hummingbird
species, this bird is not what I would call over-fond of water. It dislikes

being sprayed and because of this, I subject it to one a week only, prior to
cleaning its cage.
Claw trimming is an exacting chore which has to be carried out
periodically. As the Sungem has the smallest legs and feet of any species
I have yet encountered, the task has proved even more harrowing than
usual. Unlike the Reddish Hermit (Mobbs, 1971), the bill of the Sungem
does not require trimming. It did become overgrown a few months after
purchase, but the overgrown portion sloughed off of its own accord.
There is a belief that if birds are supplied with perches of a different
thickness, the need for claw trimming is eliminated. This is not the case
with hummingbirds and these birds should always be supplied with perches
which they can grip with ease, otherwise their claws will eventually become
deformed. I might add, it is extremely cruel to allow the claw r s of a
hummingbird to become overgrown, as these birds use their claws for
preening areas which cannot be reached with the bill.

This has been an average year for breeding results with no spectacular
successes. The nearest was the attempted breeding of our pair of
Casqued Hornbills. In 1971 the cock partially walled up a hole in a
barrel put up for them but never got any further. This year he actually
walled the hen in but after about a week she broke out again and no further
interest was taken in the barrel. It is difficult to be certain but, in
addition to mud, the cock appeared to use regurgitated food as " plaster ".
This mixture hardened off to the consistency of baked clay and one
wonders whether saliva from the bird's crop had something to do with it.
In the autumn of 1971 a young White Stork was brought into us by
the RSPCA which had fallen down a chimney and was covered in soot.
The bird carried an aluminium ring and turned out to be one of three
siblings which had left the nest in Jutland some weeks earlier. It seems
strange that they should have drifted so far west as they were all seen in
the Bath area and the remaining two were plotted down into Cornwall.

journey so, after consultation with our Editor, in her capacity as Secretary

to the I.C.B.P. we clipped the flight feathers of one wing and turned
him out with our other storks at liberty in the grounds where he soon
settled down and spent the winter and following spring. During the
summer he gradually moulted his flight feathers and became airborne
again in August. He stayed with us for some weeks and made a fine
sight on the wing, always returning in the evenings. At the beginning of
September however the migrating urge was evidently too strong and he
disappeared. He was by now in perfect condition so I hope he was able
to make the long journey.
Sacred Ibis reared five young. We have bred so many of these that we
tried a few at liberty. They stayed well for months soaring above the
grounds and foraging in the nearby fields. At nightfall they always
returned to roost on the aviary containing the breeding colony.
Eventually however they started to wander. One was caught and sent to
Slimbridge who passed it to Len Hill at Bourton-on-the-Water who
kindly returned it to us. Another was reported up in the Leicester area
but we never heard any more of it.
Scarlet Ibis nested and laid but the eggs came to nothing. I think that
the early part of the summer was too cold and wet. The only time they
really did well was the first time we bred them in 1970 and that summer
there was a fairly long hot dry spell of weather.
Our self maintaining flock of Cape Penguins is at the time of writing
down to nine birds--the lowest since they started to breed regularly.
Part of the reason for this is that some of the original birds imported in
1962 have died obviously from old age so that the death rate has exceeded
the birth rate.
The old pair of Blue and Yellow macaws reared two fine young ones,
making seventeen all told since they started breeding in 1965. A pair of
Red and Yellows reared two for the second year in succession. What is
particularly interesting is that a pair of our own home-bred Blue and
Yellows nested and laid this year. They were six years old. Unfortu-
nately the eggs came to nothing and we hope for better luck next year.
I think that this is quite as important as a first breeding if we are ever to
establish breeding stocks of foreign birds.
Leadbeater's cockatoos reared one, Roseates did nothing largely due to
the death of our old breeding hen the previous winter. We have kept
several of her progeny but so far they do not appear to be mature enough
to breed. Citron Crests hatched a chick but let it die. Umbrella
cockatoos reared a nice young one--the third in four years. They never
rear more than one at a time.
Illiger's macaws reared two fine young and Derbyan parrakeets two.
Rosellas, Stanleys and Mealies all produced a fair crop of young as did
White cockatiels and Lutino Ringnecks. Plumheads laid but failed to
hatch. It is worth recording that for the first time in my experience a pair
of Stanley parrakeets were double brooded--rearing two broods of four.

We have four species of Amazons at Rode including a pair of Orange-
winged. The latter are very pugnacious and have to be kept on their own.
Last spring we were as usual short of aviary space so we decided to put
them in a little aviary and wing clip them so that they could wander
loose during the day. In quite a short space of time they moulted their
clipped flights and started to fly, since when they have been a great
success as liberty birds, homing to their tiny aviary every night and sleeping
in their nest box. Their colouring is a perfect camouflage and when they
land in a tree, they just disappear.
New arrivals among our parrot collection in 1972 were two pairs of
Red-sided Eclectus, a Black Lory and a New Zealand Kea.
Twelve grey Peacock Pheasants were bred and quite a few Golden
Pheasants were reared at liberty by their own mothers. Exactly how many
it is difficult to say, but at least three hens were seen with young and our
liberty flock is well up in numbers with immature birds. There is a good
deal of extra work in rearing pheasants so we now concentrate on rearing
the more valuable species by hand and just raise a few of the commoner
ones to keep the numbers up.
We have a somewhat elderly cock Himalayan Monal kindly deposited
with us years ago by the Rev. P. K. Venner. This bird is infertile so we
decided to give him his liberty on the grounds. As usual with pheasants,
from being a nervous bird in an aviary where we hardly saw him, he has
become quite tame and looks truly splendid as he strides about at the
edge of the wood. He is full winged but never flies except to roost.
We see far more of him than of those kept in an aviary.
Blue Crossoptilons have been a disappointment as liberty birds.
We built up a flock of nine which stayed well for a while, but the cocks
became aggressive in the spring and they scattered over the surrounding
countryside, never to be seen again. We have found the same with
Swinhoe's which, once they are mature, are solitary and aggressive.
New arrivals in 1972 were two immature Great Argus Pheasants. These
were purchased as a pair but I am afraid are moulting out two cocks.
Our liberty flock of Carolina Ducks continues to increase and we have
counted as many as fifty birds at feeding time in the winter. At least one
pair with young have been seen on the River Frome nearby so there is
reason to believe that some pairs go off and rear their young unaided,
bringing them back to join the main flock when they can fly. As the
Carolinas increase, so do the Mandarins decrease in numbers, largely I
think because the Carolinas usurp every available nest box at breeding time.
A small number of other ducks and geese were reared including Pintails,
Tufted and Red-crested Pochard, Barnacle, Barheaded and Lesser White-
fronted Geese.
I have sadly to record the death of our old Lidth's Jay. This bird
must have been well over twenty years old and I have previously recorded
his past history.

The following studies and observations were accomplished while I was
Curator of Birds at the Brookfield Zoo, Chicago. I wish to thank the
following individuals who assisted me in compiling the data on egg and
chick weights and measurements: Paul R. Meppiel, John Gruetter,
and Ann Owens.
In September 1969, three pairs of South African Buttonquail Turnix
sylvatica lepurna were obtained from a local dealer. They were imported,
wild-trapped birds. They were placed in a cage 3x1 metre which they
shared with Nyassa Love birds, Double-banded Sandgrouse, Kittiitz
Sand Plover and Chestnut-backed Sparrow-lark. The African Waterhole
Exhibit as it was called was provided with sand and plastic boxhood
clumps. All of the above species got along quite compatibly. The
breeding of the hemipode appears to be first recorded for the Americas.

The Hemipodes were fed on Purina Game Bird Chow mixed with
Purina trout chow and small seeds. During breeding, mealworms were
supplemented. Food items offered to the other residents of the exhibit
were sometimes taken. These included fruits, ground meal, oyster shell
and pigeon pellets.

The size differences between males and females are shown on Table 1.
The hen is spotted along the side of the chest and neck with large black

<bodyText confidence="0.967991424242424" page_id="56811498"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
The calls I can attribute to this species are as follows:
The flock call is a high pitched almost inaudible chirping sound.
The alarm call is similar but much louder.
The female utters the courtship booming sound, and a growling buzz
used to threaten other birds.
The male utters a trumpeting buzz to threaten other males.
Courtship
Courtship begins in early February. It is initiated by the polyandrous
hen. She begins to take long strides--back parallel to the ground while
gently rocking the body back and forth. Sometimes the hen lies down and
the head and neck alone assume this rocking motion. This ritual attracts
males into her territory and the next phase is performed in the presence
of the cock birds. The female bends the legs and erects itself to a
45 degree angle (shown in the plate); the neck is then stretched and the
oesophagus inflated producing a booming sound reminiscent of a pigeon
but deeper. The female next sits and scrapes with the beak. The male
then gently pecks her head and nape and copulation occurs. The female
sometimes takes this initiative and mounts the male. As far as I know
this is the only instance of a female bird mounting and actually copulating
the male.
Nest and Eggs
A simple scrape in the sand is the nest site although the nest is usually
placed alongside or under a pile of straw or artificial plants. The female
rolls the eggs about in all directions for 10-20 cm.; later in the day they
were rolled back into the nest. The normal clutch is four eggs but six to
eight eggs were sometimes found in one nest probably the result of two
hens laying in it. As many as eight nests were built for the three pair of
birds and eggs were deposited in each. They are rolled by the female;
she uses her beak and backs up rolling the egg between her legs. The
first egg was laid on 25th February 1971, eggs are 20 to 28-5 mm. in
length and 16-20 mm. in width. They weigh 2-75 to 5*1 gms. The
ground colour is cream and they are streaked, spotted or blotched with
chocolate brown. The three hens laid a total of 302+ eggs from 25th

February to 24th September. This averages out to 100+ eggs per hen
in a seven month period or an average of an egg per hen every other day.
Amazing as this may seem the following observations are more startling.
On 26th May at 1.30 p.m. all eggs were taken from the cage. The next
day at 2.10 p.m. five eggs had been laid. At 11.20 a.m. on the 28th,
19 eggs were evident. The three hens therefore laid 14 eggs in 20 hours.
The largest hen was observed laying an egg at 8.00 a.m. and again at
11.00 a.m.--two to three hour interval. At 8.15 a.m. on the 29th there
were 27 eggs in the cage and at 5.05 p.m. the same day 35. A total of
43 eggs were removed at 10.30 a.m. on the 31st. Egg laying then tapered
off a bit as on 1st June there were seven eggs, on the 2nd eleven, and at
10.45 a.m. only 14. At the peak of laying--28th-29th May--the average
eggs laid per 24 hours was 5*4 and 4-2 respectively. Only one ovary was
functional as determined by X-ray and dissection.
{Editorial Note. The very striking egg-laying results which Mr. Flieg
records appear to be unique not only for this species but for birds as a
whole. In order to maintain a more balanced picture it should perhaps
be pointed out that previous observations on the breeding of this and other
Turnix species in captivity have shown a more typical egg-laying rate of
one per day. Mr. Flieg's results suggest some abnormal factors present
over a seven-day period when observations were made. His reference to
paper-thin shells may also indicate this since Schonwetter's eggshell data
give a similar shell-weights for this species and the Painted Quail.
Mr. Flieg's further comments as follows--" My hypothesis on the
Turnix egg production is this. We may assume that in the natural state
a hen lays a clutch with one mate, finds another and repeats the perfor-
mance. However, in a crowded situation in direct competition with
other hens for several males, the stimulus of the presence of the males
may be enough to increase the hormone flow and speed of ovulation;
this being a direct result of intraspecific competition. This theory
requires of coure careful testing to see if it is correct ".)
The male alone incubates the eggs but in the confines of the cage it
became an impossibility. The broody males were constantly harassed
by the hens until they deserted the eggs. Only once was a male able to
hatch a clutch in the cage. The incubation period is 12-13 days.
Incubation and Hatching
Most eggs were taken from the cage immediately and placed into a
forced air incubator at 99I *F and 85*F on the wet bulb. Out of a total of
383 eggs laid between 25th February 1970 and 23rd January 1971, 127
eggs hatched and 54 chicks were reared to maturity. After pipping the
eggs the chick always hatched in 10-20 minutes. The egg shell was paper
thin. The fertile eggs lost an average of 18% of their initial weight and
the hatching weight of the chicks varied from 2-2 to 3*09 grams with an

average weight of 2-67 gm., perhaps the smallest precocial bird. At
hatching the total body length is 42-45 mm., the wing 7-9 mm., tarsus
9-10 mm., bill 4*5-5 mm. Female chicks can be distinguished at two
days of age as they boom and assume the courtship stance of the adult.
Feeding
The newly hatched chick is a bill feeder and is fed by the male. The
male picks up the food items and offers them to the young which snatch
them greedily. We start the young birds on very tiny mealworms.
Within two to three days they are feeding themselves on mealworms,
game bird crumbles, and tiny grass seeds sprinkled with LIV as a supple-
ment. The chicks are fed many times at least once per hour and after
feeding are called back to be brooded by the male.
We tried unsuccessfully to hand-feed the young although they were
fed many times day and night. Males were not broody in the presence of
hens but when isolated from the females they never refused to accept
chicks. At one time* when a group hatched, too large for one bird to
accommodate, we introduced another male into the same cage and both
birds assumed care of the young. The chicks that hatched in the com-
munal cage would run to the hen also for food, taking it from her beak
although she had no intention of feeding them.
Captive Management
For optimum breeding in the species, it is important that a sex ratio
of two to three males per female be used. Males can then be removed
to rear the young without loss of fertility. Males are very broody and
two or more can be placed into a single cage with their broods without
any fear of aggression. The young are able to take care of themselves
at about three days of age and can safely be removed from the parent at
age 5 days.
Growth and Maturation of Young
The chick hatches with only down. On the second day the primaries
begin to show and the down attached to their tips, and the quill-sheaths
slough off them on the 14th day. The hatching weight is doubled at one
week of age. Flight is achieved at 7-11 days of age. At this age feathers
appear on the rump, back and sides of back. At 13 days of age feathers
begin on abdomen and middle breast. On the 18th day head and thigh
quills appear, the downy tips fall off the tail-feathers and full plumage is
attained. On the 22nd day yellow appears on the throat and minimum
adult proportions are achieved at 27 days of age. At this point the male
growth curve levels off and females continue to grow. At 37 days of age
copulation occurred among the young birds and at 39 days sexes are
distinguishable by size, weight and measurements. The first eggs are
laid at age four months. The Growth and Maturation of this species
was contrasted with that of a Galliform bird, the Painted Quail,

KEEPING AND BREEDING THE COLLARED

Otus bakkamoena

Introduction

Although diverse species of the Strigiformes are distributed over the
entire surface of the earth, with the exception of the Antartic, and many
of these species have been known to aviculture for many years, relatively
little detailed information seems to have been recorded in concise form.
When I decided to specialise in keeping and attempting to breed Owls in
1970, I resolved to make a modest contribution to recorded information.
The present notes refer to the Collared Scops Owl, the reason being
that a friend of mine, Mr. Harry Smith succeeded in breeding this species
in 1972 and due to pressure of business he has asked me to record the
details. The information recorded below is an amalgam of Mr. Smiths'
experience in breeding these birds, a collation of extracts from the writings
of other authors and my own experience in maintaining two males in
captivity for three years.

If any readers of this magazine can enlarge on, corroborate or have any
reason to think any of the remarks erroneous, I hope that they will either
write an article or letter to the editor, or to me. It is only by pooling
information that any significant contribution to science can be made.
Description
The sub-species of Otus bakkamoena , are from written descriptions,
very similar in appearance and the identification of an individual would
seem to be rather difficult without access to a comprehensive reference
collection.
For a detailed description, I include the details of the colouration of my
birds, which although imported from Northern India are of uncertain
identity. Iris dark brown. Eyelids and tear streak dark brown, the
edges of the eyelids are pink. Face fawn. Lower eyebrow white, the
upper eyebrows which stretch to the upper side of the ear are fawn.
The face is edged with dark brown. The crown is dark brown, mottled
with lighter shades of brown. Breast fawn, with pronounced broken
vertical barring of dark brown, faint transverse barring of greyish brown.
Back medium brown, mottled with dark brown--edged with a row of fawn
feathers. Flight and tail feathers horizontally barred with alternate stripes
of light and dark brown. Legs feathered, but toes naked, toe colour
greyish pink. Claws horn coloured with grey tips. Cere pink, beak horn
coloured. Length 8J ins.
The species has a wide distribution, from the Persian Gulf through
Pakistan, India, Burma, China, Japan, Korea and Ussuriland and south
through Indo-China, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to Java, Borneo, and the
Philippines.
Calls
Various authors give the call as " too-whoo ", " kwo-oo " or " wo-wo-wo,
wo-o, o-o " and also mention another call of "kwow" repeated in quick
succession.
My own birds (two adult males and the two sub-adults bred by Mr.
H. Smith) utter a call of " he-ooo ", with the first syllable more emphasised
and higher in pitch. They also repeat a growling " kwow " in quick
succession, the head being thrust forward and bowed with each call.
My birds also emit a greeting call either to each other, or to me when I
approach their flight with food, which can be best described as a plaintive
mew. I have also observed my birds looking into each other's faces and
making a twittering call.
When alarmed or angry, my Collared Scops Owls fan their wings, thrust
their heads forward, clap their beaks and make a deep throaty growl.

<bodyText confidence="0.987667357142857" page_id="56811505"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
Authors cite insects as forming the bulk of the Collared Scops Owl's
diet, although birds, small rodents and bats are mentioned. My birds
readily take white mice and day old chicks, the latter being preferred.
I have offered live locusts, but although some were taken, they were
mostly ignored; mealworms remained in the flight for many days, but as
they were not touched were ultimately removed.
It might be opportune to mention here, that in the past and to a lesser
extent today, many captive raptors die unnecessarily as the result of incorrect
feeding. My two original birds were bought by a friend of mine who saw
them at a well-known dealers', after admiring them but explaining that she
was unable to provide a suitable diet, the vendor explained that he was
feeding them entirely on minced raw beef and that was perfectly adequate.
After being assured that beef was a suitable diet, my friend bought two of
these Owls, but after they settled in her accommodation it was obvious that
both birds were seriously ill, being very thin and weak. Fortunately the
diet was immediately changed to mice and a complete recovery was made
by both birds, which were then transferred to my collection. Sub-
sequent investigation showed that the dealer in question imported several
Small Indian Owls, but all gradually deteriorated in health and I feel
certain that this deterioration can be attributed to the unsuitable diet.
Another instance brought to my notice, was that of a dealer who imported
a number of Scops Owls and only offered whole Guinea pigs as food.
Of course, such large carcasses are totally unsuitable for small Owls as they
are unable to break them up. I understand that this thoughtlessness
caused the death of most of the Owls.
I think that the rule that should be applied to all Owls, is that they
should be fed whole carcasses (insect, bird or mammal) which are of a
suitable size to be eaten in their entirety.
Nidification
The Collared Scops Owl nests in hollows in trees, cavities in buildings
or cliffs or in the bases of large nests, such as those of Vultures. Two to
five white eggs are laid from December to April depending upon locality
and measure in average of 35 mm. x 28 mm.
Breeding in Captivity
It would seem that Scops Owls have so far only been bred infrequently
and I can find no previous record of the Collared Scops Owl breeding in
this country.
The Scops Owl, Otus scops , (Meade-Waldo 1899) and White-faced
Scops Owl, O. leuzotis , have been bred in captivity and Prestwich ( 1955 )
notes that two Plume-footed or Half-Collared Scops Owls, O. b. semitorques,
are listed in the sale catalogue for Spedan Lewis' famous collection of Owls,
with the information that they " have nested ". However although I

have searched through available literature, I can find nothing to indicate
that any youngsters were reared.
The Collared Scops Owl was bred with considerable success at the
Zoological Gardens Dehiwela, Ceylon, during the 1940's. Several pairs
were kept in a large aviary along with a solitary Black Bittern. Nest-boxes
were situated in opposite corners of the aviary and the birds bred frequently.
The birds bred by Mr. H. Smith at Basildon, Essex, were imported
during the summer of 1970 and were thought to be two males and two
females. The four birds were housed in an outside aviary in Mr. Smith's
collection which, until 1971, was in Devon. In 1971 the collection was
moved to Essex and while a new zoo was under construction, the Collared
Scops Owls were housed temporarily in a 4 ft. stock cage in a draught
proof and well lighted, but unheated, shed. It was in this accommodation
that the breeding occurred.
In early May 1972 it was noticed that two of the Scops Owls had paired
and courtship behaviour was observed, therefore two nest-boxes each
12 in. x 12 in. x 12 in. with a vee-shaped entrance hole, were stood on the
floor in opposite corners of the cage. The mating pair occupied one box
immediately and three eggs were laid, all hatched, but one disappeared
after a week. The remaining two youngsters were reared without problems
and left the nest-box when between five and six weeks old. The youngsters
were identical in size and colouration to the parents, there would appear
to be no juvenile stage regarding colouration. Unfortunately it was not
possible to examine the nest frequently, so period of incubation, dates of
laying, hatching etc. are not known. The adult birds were rather shy
and resented disturbance, so they were left alone as much as possible.
The two other adult birds remained in the cage throughout this period
and no friction was noticed.
Mr. Smith's owls are all fed entirely on chicks and the Collared Scops
Owls reared two strong youngsters on this diet without additives. They
also had clean water for bathing always available. Many owls bath
frequently and my Collared Scops bath on average three times a week.
I have on several occasions observed incubating owls of various species,
bath and then return to the nest with the feathers very wet. I think
therefore that it is most important that bathing facilities are always available
for incubating owls, as they would seem to use this method of adjusting
the humidity of the nest to the correct level for hatching. It should also
be noted that owls will not normally bath in water that is stale or dirty.
When independent, Mr. Smith's two young owls were transferred to
my collection and on comparison proved to be identical in size, markings
and colouration to my two original birds (described earlier).
With only Mr. Smith's breeding pair of certain sex, it is difficult to make
any meaningful observation on factors that indicate a bird's sex, however
going purely on this very slender evidence it would seem that the female
is larger and has darker and more pronounced marking on the crown--*
this however may first prove to be individual variation.

Conclusions
Obviously with my limited experience and the scanty information at
my disposal any conclusion will have to be recognised as being provisional.
It would seem that Scops Owls can be bred in captivity without too much
trouble, the paucity of previous successes, probably results from few
attempts rather than insurmountable problems.
As described above, the Collared Scops Owl, Otus bakkamoena , has been
bred by Mr. H. Smith. It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Hon. Assistant Editor.

Rare newcomers are a pair of Iris lorikeets ( Psitteuteles iris). These
birds have so far only a few times been offered for sale by dealers and are
not well known to scientists. Even detailed special works contain but
few data on the habits of these parrots, so our zoo is very glad now to keep
a pair of them.

In view of the concern felt about the possibility of extermination of some
of the Amazon Parrots of the Caribbean region it is pleasing to hear of
the first breeding of Guilding's Amazon, or the St. Vincent Parrot, at
Houston Zoo, Texas. The breeding was from two of five birds from
various zoos and individuals brought together for this purpose. One
young one was raised.

David Lack and family, who visited St. Vincent in 1971 to study the
bird-life saw this parrot in all rain-forest areas that they visited and
commented that " it should survive provided enough rain forest survives
Like a number of other rare bird species its ultimate fate appears to depend
largely on the lumber industry. It appears, however, to be in a slightly
better state than the Puerto Rican Parrot which, according to a recent
study by Dr. Kepler, has declined from c. 189 in 1969 to c. 15 in 1971.
Faced with reduction of the forest to a rather limited relic in an area of
poor weather conditions, with loss of nest-holes through tree-felling, and
with a population explosion of the competing Pearly-eyed Thrasher
reducing existing sites and preventing the possible provision of new ones,
plus a population now so small that capture for captive breeding is difficult,
the species is in a very bad position.
Mrs. Marsault, who recorded in the magazine in 1969 egg-laying and
incubation by her Guillemots in Devon had further success in 1972 when
an egg hatched. Unfortunately she was ill at the time and unable to give
the young one special attention and it lived only for five days. It is,
I think, the only hatching of an auk in captivity on this side of the Atlantic.
In the U.S.A. they had a more complete success with the breeding of
the Tufted Puffin at the New York Zoological Park in 1970.

My only acquaintance with these birds in captivity was when I visited
Miss C. A. Nicholls at Perth, Western Australia in 1966. She tended
wrecked or injured sea-birds as well as other casualties. A large suburban-
type garden had, in addition to other occupants such as an Australian
Magpie with a fondness for attacking bare toes in sandels, two young
Giant Petrels wandering among the shrubs, having been kept for over a
year and a Black-browed Albatross with an eye injury sitting on the lawn.
In a wire-netting aviary were several Slender-billed Shearwaters and a
pair of these had actually burrowed and laid an egg. I believe that this
last constitutes an avicultural record at present.

I was pleased to see that accounts of first breedings recently included, as
well as records of the rare and difficult, the apparently first breedings of a
waxbill species and one of the commoner bunting. There seems to be a
general assumption that if a bird is relatively expensive and fairly easily
obtained then it must have been bred in captivity and everything about it
must already be known. The first is very often untrue, the second almost
always untrue.

The latest number of " Captive breedings of diurnal birds of prey " by
the British Falconer's Club and the Hawk Trust records, inter alia, the
breeding of the Sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus, in Devon in 1971 and 1972
by Dr. L. H. Hurrell. Single young were reared in each instance.
The Hawk Trust also records the breeding of a Caracara after eggs had
been laid in two earlier seasons. This is presumably the Crested Caracara,
Polyborus plancus, although the species is not stated.

We have heard from Mr. Bertagnolio that the Council of the Italian
League against the Destruction of Birds is attempting to reintroduce the
Egyptian Vulture which has disappeared from most of Italy except the
extreme southern tip and on Sicily. A captive breeding programme is
being started with four birds. Mr. Bertagnolio comments that they had
earlier hoped to do a similar project with Eagle-Owls but had been unable
to obtain birds from reputable sources.

Readers of the magazine will probably have noticed that in articles
dealing with the behaviour of aviary birds, and particularly with regard to
waxbills, there is often some reference to Desmond Morris's writings on
the subject. Mr. R. U. Lambert has written pointing out that a number
of these very interesting, if at times a little technical, studies by Dr. Morris

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
The Long-tailed Tit, Aegithalos caudatus , is one of the loveliest of our
small, native species. It presents some difficulties as an avicultural
subject. It is one of those very small, constantly active species; finding
tiny morsels of food on the twigs, branches and leaves of trees and shrubs.
It appears to have a high metabolic rate and a need to constantly stoke-up
with food, and therefore requires careful provision of food to ensure that
it is available when needed and also to ensure that each individual is able
to obtain a reasonable share.
Works on ornithology do not suggest any way of sexing this species,
but some aviculturists who have had experience in keeping them are of
the opinion that they can normally be sexed by comparison of the head
markings. On either side of an otherwise pale head a bold dark band of
blackish brown extends back over the eye to the nape. In the living bird,
this certainly varied between individuals, and the fine photograph by
Derek Washington, used as a frontispiece for this number of the magazine,
shows a close view of the heads of two young birds, illustrating the extent
to which these markings may vary. Birds with broad markings are said
to be males, those with narrower markings females. Unfortunately this
variation is not apparent to the same extent in museum specimens, possibly
as a result of movement of the skin during preparation of preserved speci-
mens and it is not possible to cross-check from this source. In view of
the variation in plumage pattern and colour throughout the geographical
range it is possible that this sexual difference would only apply to some races.
Another problem for the aviculturist who tries to breed this species is
the provision of suitable nest material. One principal constituent, which
sticks together the fragments of moss and lichen to form the domed nest
of the Long-tailed Tit is fresh spiders' webs. Spiders' webs are a natural
material which is usually to hand somewhere in a wild area, but is extremely
difficult to supply in adequate quantities in the confines of an aviary, and I
have not heard of a really effective and generally available substitute.
It is perhaps a mercy that so few of the birds which we try to keep
need this material to bind the nest together. If one examines the breeding
of birds in tropical and subtropical regions, it becomes apparent that a
surprising number of smaller, insectivorous birds use this material and a
basic element for binding and shaping the nest. In such regions spiders
tend to be larger and more plentiful and there is likely to be a more adequate
supply of bigger and stronger spiders' webs to utilise for this purpose.

J. O. D'EATH--KEEPING FREE-WINGED WATERFOWL
ON KEEPING FREE-WINGED WATERFOWL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9941948" page_id="56811520"  page_num="70" year="" vol="">
By J. O. D'Eath (Monken Hadley, Herts, England)
Having eschewed an interest in ornithology at an early age it was in my
two closing years at school that my attention became focussed more
specifically on aviculture and waterfowl in particular. Thus it was in
1929 that I based the foundations of my collection. It started in a modest
way with several Common Shelduck {Tadorna tadorna) reared from eggs
lifted in the wild on the Somerset coastline. During the passage of time,
now some 40 years, the collection grew in size and accommodated as many
as 90 different species including some rarities and one derived great
pleasure from breeding successes personal or otherwise, but of course
disappointment and failure outweighed these as it always will.
I suppose as one grows older one becomes more aesthetic in one's
outlook and the appeal of seeing birds at liberty grows stronger.
Therefore in the last few years I have been prompted to experiment
with free-wing species. This of course has been done by others before,
but the purpose of these notes is to encourage the younger generation of
waterfowl keepers to be bold enough to experiment.
I must assume that the governing measure of success must be local
habitat and therefore where some may succeed others may fail. It must
be obvious that if one's collection for example is geographically situated
near attractive wet-land or on a riverine site then losses must occur.
I am situated in an urban area and, in spite of this, have been surprised
at being able to hold unlikely species. I will now turn to the individual
species of birds currently free-winged in the collection and comment on
each.
Mandarin (Aix galericulata)
Apart from being one of the most spectacular plumaged of the waterfowl,
this species is undoubtedly the most likely to succeed as a free-wing
subject. It has of course established itself in the wild in various parts of
the United Kingdom. I have maintained 10/15 P a i rs here for a number
of years and it is an unceasing delight to see these birds flight in and
land at one's feet at feeding time. In Spring I derive the greatest pleasure
from seeing the Mandarin pairs prospecting for nesting sites sometimes
60 ft. up in tall trees. The late J. C. Laidlay established a similar colony
in his small garden on the banks of the Tay in Perth, Scotland and here
even today as many as forty Mandarin may be seen flighting in to two
very small concrete pools. They also return to nest in boxes put out
for them. Of the Mandarin I rear each year, I usually release about five
pairs to maintain the stock. By no means all the free-wing birds nest on
the property and it is usually not until the beginning of October that one

sees birds reared by their parents coming into to feed. Mandarins are
very fond of acorns and may be the presence of a good number of Oaks
here has some bearing on their autumnal showing.
Carolina (Atx sponsa )
A similar bird in its habits to the Mandarin but not quite so successful
in my opinion. Its flight is low and undoubtedly it does not propagate
itself so freely in the wild, hence one has to continually rear and release
young birds to maintain the stock. Nevertheless they would appear to
be good stayers.
Maned Goose (Chenonetta jubata)
Supposedly allied to the above in science and another suitable subject
for liberty. I started with an unpinioned male paired to a pinioned
female and have progressed from there. These birds are very confiding
and tame by nature and it is nice to see them sitting on gate-posts on the
wire perimeter fence and not taking wing till one almost touches them.
A fellow aviculturist in Essex who had some of my original stock now
has a sizeable free-wing colony. My Maned Geese do not seem to be
so arboreal in the habits as the Mandarin and Carolina, but as already
mentioned use gate posts and fences for perching.
Chili Pintail {Anas georgica spinicauda)
At one time after the War, this species was a rare one in collections
and I well remember obtaining the first two pairs to come into a private
collection from a Dutch dealer. Since those early days they have been
freely bred and have now reached the stage where they are difficult to sell.
However, on the credit side of the balance, I have found them excellent
subjects at liberty and they visit the various small ponds in turn. For the
first time this year a pair bred away and returned in July with four fully
grown young which were caught and ringed with Avicultural Society
rings. My stock are extremely tame and it is sometimes difficult to
deliberately get them on wing.
Eider (Somateria mollissima)
For many years now, I have made a point of not pinioning this species,
but to be honest not for the purpose of maintaining a liberty stock.
The Eider in captivity is a gross feeder and becomes overweight and if
getting on wing has difficulty in maintaining altitude. I always have
7/8 adult pairs and in the last 20 years have experienced only two losses
(one recovered). In both cases these were females, the latter bearing an
Avicultural Society ring was recovered about 10 miles away. The other
did not return. They will occasionally fly the width of the pond, more
particularly in Spring.

J. O. D'EATH--KEEPING FREE-WINGED WATERFOWL
Red-bill Whistling Duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis autumnalis)
This is an ideal free-wing subject and over the years according to
breeding success I have always had a small number of this species at
liberty. They are exceedingly tame and tree-perching, and with me
never wander beyond the confines of the collection. I have likewise had
the individual Fulvous (Z). bicolor ) under the same conditions. If my
memory serves me right I recall a small flock of White-faced Whistlers
free-winged at the famous Walcot Hall collection of Messrs. R. &amp; N.
Stevens before World War II. I think the whole family Dendrocygnae
are very suitable subjects for liberty birds.
Common Teal {Anas crecca crecca )
I would not say that this species is guaranteed to stay, but I have
enjoyed reasonable success and currently have two males which have been
in the collection for five years but which do disappear for brief periods.
Barnacle Geese (Branta leucopsis)
For some reason this species breeds well in the collection and I have
annually liberated 6/12 birds. I think the main basis to start is to have a
free-wing gander paired to a breeding female. The ensuent family will
then usually stay together. One can then carry it a stage farther by
feather-clipping one or two of the brood for the first year. At one time I
had a small flock of 12 on wing for 3 years and when they finally decided
to leave they appropriately moved to the Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge
and joined the wild White-fronts, causing some consternation and head-
scratching among the experts who were baffled by the sudden extension
of the Barnacles known range in the British Isles. Owing to lack of space
I have not experimented with other species of geese, but in larger
collections such as Slimbridge and elsewhere a greater variety of geese
have been successfully kept at liberty over the years.
Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadornd)
Alt: ddgh frowned upon by most Waterfowl keepers as a common bird,
this s^&amp;es is undoubtedly one of the most colourful of our native birds.
Here again a start was made by pairing a free-wing male to a pinioned duck.
Being a marine duck I was extremely sceptical of success, thinking that
the call of the sea would prove too much. However, this was not the
case and I now have five birds on the wing. It is interesting to note
that whilst in their natural habitat of the shore-line they have no obstacles
to negotiate and here they have to negotiate tall trees to effect a landing
and they accomplish this with far greater expertise than wild Mallard.
Knobnose Goose or Comb Duck ( Sarkidiornis melanotos melanotus)
About five years ago I reared a number of these birds, the female
laying 13 eggs in her first clutch. From the surplus undisposed of I
retained a pair unpinioned, which were feather-clipped their first year.

C. J. O. HARRISON--PLUMAGE PATTERN OF SPARROW AND QUAIL 73
These have successfully stayed ever since and it is interesting to note that
they always fly independently and not together. The male, however,
does make far-ranging flights off the property and is sometimes away for
hours at a time. It is always with a sigh of relief when I see him safely
back again within the confines of the collection. I was anticipating that
they might breed away from the property like some of the Mandarin but
so far this has not occurred.
Summary
As I mentioned initially, the foregoing notes are intended to encourage
waterfowl keepers to experiment on similar modest lines to myself and
I am sure the great pleasure they derive from any success achieved will be
an ample reward. There are obviously numerous other species which
would be suitable subjects for experiment and this can only be ascertained on
a " trial and error " principle. The free-wing plan can sometimes operate
on a reverse " lease-lend " basic and I have from time to time had wild
birds fly in and pair to pinioned females. Recently this Spring, a male
Shoveller (Spatula clypeatd) has arrived and paired to a female in the
collection and similar instances with European Teal and Tufted Duck
have occurred in the past.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
I recently had the opportunity to observe a number of individuals of a
buff strain of the House Sparrow, Passer domesticus , bred by Mr. T. Dooley,
and through the kindness of Mr. John Dowling have received specimens
of the buff variety of the Painted Quail, Excalfactoria chinensis. In
referring to a buff variety I mean the non-eumelanic variant hi v4lich
black melanin pigment is usually absent from the plumage. These tw^y
forms are of special interest, because of the extent to which not only the
chestnut-red melanin but also some black-pigmented signal elements of
the normal male plumage pattern are retained.
In the sparrows the females appear a light, buffy-brown. The males
retain in addition the broad chestnut-red band across the side of the head
and similar colour on the wings and the mantle. They also have a black
throat patch present to some degree, and in most individuals some black
colour is also present on the lores. One or two of the birds seen showed
more extensive dark markings on the head.
This retention of marking is even more apparent in the Painted Quail.
The female of this species shows typical loss of black markings in the buff
variant, the plumage being buff and brown with whitish patches where the

74 C. J. O. HARRISON--PLUMAGE PATTERN OF SPARROW AND QUAIL
black marks would normally appear on feathers. These pale areas were
not wholly white on the specimens examined but showed a greyish-blue
tint. This might be due to the retention of very small quantities of
eumelanin thinly dispersed within the feather, but might alternatively be
caused by the reflection of light from an unpigmented feather structure,
since in some non-eumelanic varieties of pigeons the unpigmented feather
areas have a bluish-grey tint for this reason.
The chestnut-red pigment present in small quantities, tinting the throat,
eyestripe and pale streaks of the back, and present to varying degrees
elsewhere in the plumage, is retained in the variant female. Dark
markings such as the ventral barring in the typical form are due to a
combination of both brown and black pigment, and although the black is
lost in the variant form, similar markings in brown are still present.
The loss of colour is most apparent on the flight feathers and primary
coverts of the wings which are almost white. The bill is still black and
there is no suggestion of loss of pigment other than in the plumage.
The male quail shows a similar loss of black markings to that of the
female, where the dorsal plumage and wings are concerned. The head
and mantle show a series of rows of small greyish-white spots replacing
black marks, but the mottling is less apparent on the back which appears
mainly chestnut-red with paler longitudinal streakings. The most
striking feature is that the entire ventral plumage pattern, including the
chestnut-red of belly and under tail coverts, and the slate-blue of breast,
flanks forehead and tertials, is retained, apparently unchanged. Apart
from a slight loss of black, producing a dark brownish-black, the bold
facial pattern is also retained. One would not immediately associate this
variation with the other non-eumelanic forms.
In both these species therefore a variant form occurs in which black
pigment is usually completely lost but in these instances is retained in
some signal markings of the male. Since there is some individual
variation it might be argued that the change is produced by a gene of
incomplete penetrance and that the presence of these markings merely
reflects the failure of the gene to achieve its full effect.
There is, however, evidence from variant plumages in the Zebra Finch,
Taeniopygia guttata , such as the " penguin " variety, indicating that the
bold black breast pattern characteristic of the male may be under separate
genetic control from the remainder of the pattern and that its presence or
absence may occur without affecting the remaining plumage pattern.
In the House Sparrow and Painted Quail the markings that are retained
in the buff variant are conspicuous markings characteristic of the species
and sex. It therefore seems possible that this might be a parallel case to
that of the Zebra Finch and that these markings also might be under
separate genetic control from the rest of the plumage and not immediately
affected by a genetic change which otherwise has a modifying effect on
the plumage in general.

(Tauraco schalowi)
By D. Grenville Roles (Deputy Curator of Birds)
Distribution
Found in suitable localities throughout Angola, Botswana, Zambia,
Rhodesia and the Southern Congo, our pair of Tauraco schalowi
(Reichenow) came from the vicinity of Luanda in Angola. The male
arrived in August 1966, the female in May 1971.
Description
Equal to a small pigeon in size but with a long fan-shaped tail and long
pointed crest, these touracos have the typically beautiful plumage and
striking appearance of the " forest-dwelling " species, with light green
head, neck and breast, sooty black underparts and rump and irridescent
emerald and violet-blue back and wing coverts. The tail is entirely
violet-blue and the flight feathers are brilliant crimson. The bill and
eye-wattle are coral red with a short white stripe in front of and a long
white stripe below the large brown eyes. Legs and feet are black.
Accommodation
The aviary is approximately 20 ft. x 8 ft. X 6 ft. high with a shelter
15 ft. x 8 ft. X 9 ft. high at the rear of the flight, a nest pan 7 ins. x 10 ins.
of weldmesh covered by hessian and with a ij ins. x\ in. wooden rim, is
fixed about 1 ft. from the ceiling in a dark corner of the shelter.
The flight floor is covered with a deep layer of sand over gravel, the
shelter floor is covered with sawdust. The flight is planted with flowering
currant Rihes sanguineum and Cupressus macrocarpa.
Sharing the aviary are a pair of Blue Eared Pheasants Crossoptilon
auritum whom the Touracos ignore; neighbours are a pair of Grey Touracos
Corythaixodies c. concolor with whom Tauraco schalowi bicker, and on the
other side a breeding pair of Keas (separated by double mesh of course),
who are also ignored.

Shortly after her clearance from quarantine and a brief period in a very
large aviary, the female escaped through a previously unnoticed hole in
the wire netting. She remained at liberty for 6 months, feeding (from
telephoned reports within a \ mile radius of the Zoo) upon apples,
blackcurrants, blackberries, elderberries and hawthorn berries. Event-
ually she was recaptured in excellent condition, in a cat-trap baited with
orange. She was frequently heard and seen in the Zoo grounds and

provided an exotic spectacle when seen flying between groups of trees.
During this period she was seen to visit a solitary individual of her species
and " bill " with it through the wire in a very friendly fashion, but
persistently attacked a (believed) pair of Tauracoschalowi in the aviary next
door but one to the single bird.
On her recapture she was placed with the single specimen, who after a
minutes chase, inspection, and domination, accepted her.
The birds' relationship went from strength to strength and the male,
(as he was to prove himself) was seen feeding the female, who solicited
this action by juvenile wing fluttering and gaping. No recognizable form
of courtship was observed though when one unexpectedly alighted beside
the other they would " bill ", shaking their heads from side to side and
" flashing " their facial pattern, while both uttering a staccato grumble.
Mating was never observed and no form of nest building was seen to
take place, the first dull white egg being laid on the 13th April, 1972 in
the totally unadorned nest platform. A second egg was laid on the
15th April. One of these was found smashed at the end of the flight
furthest from the nest on the 20th April, the remaining egg disappeared on
the 9th May.
The eggs of the second clutch were laid on the 24th and 26th May,
both eggs hatching on 16th June.
The development of the chicks has been tabled below for comparison
with the development of the two other species of Touraco, whose chicks
we have successfully reared. The data in each case refer to the first
successfully reared brood.
Both chicks described are now fully grown and in apparently perfect
health.
As described above, Schalow's Touraco, Tauraco schalowi has been
bred at the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust. It is believed that this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is required to communicate at once
with the Assistant Editor.

HUMMINGBIRD

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, England)
The Tourmaline Sunangel, Heliangelus exortis , can be found in the
temperate zone of the Western and Central Andes, subtropical zone of
the Eastern Andes of Colombia and of Eastern Ecuador (Peters 1945).
The male is a predomantly dark green bird. The upper parts are not
iridescent, the feathers do have a shine to them, however. The chest and
forehead are iridescent; chin and upper throat glittering violet-blue;
lower throat glittering red, appearing as pink in certain lights. The tail
which is long and deeply forked, has outer feathers of black and the central
pair bronzy green. The primaries are also deep black. The vent and
undertail coverts are white (adding greatly to the beauty of this species);
there are also white ocular patches.
The female is also a dark green bird with a white chin and throat.
The tail is shorter than in the male and not so deeply forked.
The male in my collection, is one of the few hummingbirds I have
purchased which has not been a new import. It had in fact been in the
country 17 months before it came into my possession. I first saw this
bird at my importer-friend's establishment, where it was housed with an
assorted batch of hummers, newly arrived from Ecuador. As well as this
male, there were two other males and one female.
Although I was very taken with the species, all the Sunangels in the
consignment appeared to be extremely belligerent and because of this,
I decided against purchasing one.
The male which is now in my collection, was orginally sold to a person
who housed it in a cage in his lounge. These conditions were far from
ideal, partly because the bird received no live food. As this was the only
bird owned by this person at the time, he soon grew tired of it and
eventually it was sold to a friend who kept a mixed collection of exotics,
which included two or three hummingbirds. It was from this person that
I acquired the Sunangel.
I have given a brief history of the bird in question, mainly because the
species is considered by many to be a difficult one to keep alive in confine-
ment for any length of time. In fact of the four which originally came in,
the male now in my collection is the sole survivor.
A friend of mine who is usually most successful with hummingbirds,
has had no luck with this species. The first Sunangel he acquired, died
within two months, the second and third died within a matter of days.
All were in seemingly good health at the time of death. Other friends of
mine have had reasonable success with this species, but none of the birds
have lived more than four months, even when housed under seemingly
ideal conditions. It is therefore, all the more surprising that the male now

in my collection, survived when the conditions in which it was housed
could not be classed as suitable for even the most robust of hummingbird
species. There is a possibility that this male holds the longevity record
for the species in this country.
When I purchased the Sunangel, most of its primaries were white or
near white. There were also white patches in the outer tail feathers.
I put this down to the bird receiving little or no live food during the
period of the moult. As it happened, I purchased the bird just at the
right moment, as within twelve days it had commenced to moult. In
hummingbirds, it is usually the primaries which are the first to go and as
I had had this bird so short a time, I would not have been surprised if
the first feathers to be shed had grown in abnormally coloured. I always
have an abundance of fruit-flies and the Sunangel took these avidly the
moment it was released into my communal hummingbird flight. This
moult took ten weeks and when completed, the birds' plumage was
immaculate and was the correct colour throughout.
This bird has continued to take large numbers of fruit-flies each day and
has proved to be the most insectivorous species I have so far owned.

I have mentioned earlier that this species can be most belligerent.
Other hummingbird enthusiasts who have owned Sunangels, will I feel
sure, be in agreement with this. It was therefore with some perturbation
that I released the Sunangel into my hummingbird flight. The bird was
obviously not in the best of health as not only had it moulted incorrectly,
it was also very much underweight. Perhaps this helped somewhat with
the introduction to the flight, even so the Sunangel did show aggression to
certain species. Two birds which helped keep the Sunangel " in its place "
was a male Velvet-purple Coronet, Boissonneaua jardini , and a male
Sapphire-vented Puffleg, Eriocnemis luciani. The former would most
probably have ignored the Sunangel but for its abnormal plumage.
This presumption is based on the fact that the Coronet attacked the
Sunangel only when the latter was flying. At such times, the Sunangel
showed large areas of white against what was otherwise a predominantly
dark green bird. I have been unable to house White-necked Jacobins,
Florisuga mellivora , or Black Jacobins, Melanotrochilus fuscus , with the
Coronet, because of the predominantly black and white plumage of these
species. Once the Sunangel had shed the white feathering, the Coronet
ignored it completely.
The Sapphire-vented Puffleg and the Sunangel disliked each other on
sight and will obviously continue to do so for the remainder of their lives.
At first the Sunangel, being the newcomer to an already well established
collection, was wary of the Puffleg and there were times when I feared the
former would have to be removed from the flight. However, over a period
of a few months, there developed a pattern of behaviour which appears
to satisfy both birds. During the morning period, the Sunangel is the
dominant of the two and does on occasions show extreme aggression
toward the Puffleg. From around mid-day to 3 p.m. is always a quiet
period as most of the hummers are at rest. After this quiet period and
up until roosting time (10 p.m.), the Puffleg becomes the dominant
character and it is this bird's turn to show extreme aggression towards
the Sunangel.
Species from the genera Heliangelus and Eriocnemis , appear to be very
much alike in many ways. For example the Tourmaline Sunangel and
the Glowing Puffleg, E. vestitus , are very similar. Both species being
predominantly dark green, with patches of highly iridescent plumage
(Perhaps I should point out that this applies to males only; female
Sunangels having white in their makeup). The shape of these
species is also similar. I mention this as there is a possibility that the
aggression shown is due to this similarity. This is most certainly the case
where such species as Amazilias and certain species of Sapphires (both
Hylocharis and Chrysuronia ) are concerned.
The Tourmaline Sunangel is extremely vocal (this is where it differs
greatly from the Eriocnemis , as birds from this genus appear to be silent),
and its song can be heard many times throughout the day. The song

consists of one note--Zzzzzt--which is repeated three or four times, when
there is a slight pause before the note is again repeated. When showing
aggression, the Sunangel uses this same note but it is more harsh, also the
beautiful iridescent throat patch is thrust out more than it is during the
normal-type song.
During quiet periods this hummer will perch on one leg and puff out
its feathers, giving the appearance of being ill. While in this position, it
will on occasions, sing a subdued version of the normal-type song. As the
bird dozes, so the song is repeated less frequently until eventually the bird
becomes silent. It needs only a slight disturbance, however, for the
Sunangel to commence singing again.
I have found many species of birds kept in captivity, are encouraged to
sing when music or such sounds as boiling kettles or vacuum-cleaners are
heard. The sunbirds in my collection sing exuberantly when my wife
is using the vacuum-cleaner in the hallway outside the birdroom.
I mention this inducement to sing because until I purchased the Sunangel,
I had not been aware hummingbirds could also be induced to sing.
The Tourmaline Sunangel, although perhaps not so ready to break into
song as the sunbirds, nevertheless is induced to sing when hearing prolonged
bouts of music, etc. One sound in particular which never fails to persuade
this hummer to sing is that of a scrubbing brush being run over the
wire-mesh of the flight.
In a letter which appeared in the correspondence column of this
magazine (1971), I gave a list of hummingbird species which I had
observed indulging the habit of resting on one foot. This list did not
include the Heliangelus, as at the time I had not owned a member of
this genus. After careful observation of the male exortis in my collection,
and through correspondence with other hummingbird enthusiasts, I feel
it is safe to say the Tourmaline Sunangel spends more time resting on one
foot than any other species I have so far studied.
Although either foot can be used for gripping the perch, it appears the
right foot is the most favoured. As with the Boissonneaua, I have yet to
see the Sunangel actually roosting while gripping the perch with one foot.
With certain species of hummingbirds, it is often difficult to decide
where aggressive attitudes end and mating display begins. This is
particularly so with the Tourmaline Sunangel. As already mentioned,
when showing aggression this species does utter a more harsh note than
in the normal-type song, also the throat-patch is more pronounced.
When showing aggression, the bird will hold its body sideways along the
perch, with the wings hanging loosely to the sides and the tail feathers
fanned. If this show of aggression is not enough to route the bird at
which it is being directed, the Sunangel will become most agitated and will
leave the perch and bombard its unfortunate " victim " from all directions.
The Sunangel will on occasions force, its " victim " to leave the perch by
pecking at its vent.

As mentioned, the mating display of the Sunangel is very much the
same as the aggressive display. There is a possibility, however, that I do
not witness the entire mating display of this species, as although my
hummingbird flight is 18 ft. long, it is only 2 ft. 6 ins. wide, and this could
limit the bird's actions somewhat.
The pronounced wing-action of this species is used each time the bird
alights. Although not so exaggerated as that of the Coronet Humming-
birds (Mobbs 1972), this wing-action is nevertheless most noticeable.
The Coronets hold their wings erect each time they alight; the wings are
then brought down abruptly and folded into the resting position. The
Sunangels, upon alighting, hold their wings horizontal and move them
two or three times before folding them into the resting position. This
action is more leisurely than it is in the Coronets and the wings are held
much more loosely.
The wing-action of the Tourmaline Sunangel is very much in evidence
prior to the mating display. At such times the bird will continually flick
its wings, it will also open and close its tail feathers continually.
Until I purchased the Sunangel, I had always looked upon the Sapphire-
vented Puffleg as being the most prolific bather of the hummingbird
species I had so far owned. I now consider the Sunangel to be equally
as fond of bathing--yet another similarity between the species. As well
as taking at least five or six baths daily, the Sunangel also drinks a certain
amount of water. In fact each morning as soon as the birdroom lights
are turned on, the Sunangel goes down to the bathing saucers to drink
before taking nectar. It can be seen taking water from these saucers many
times throughout the day also. Many hummingbird species take water
regularly, but I have witnessed the following species only, take water
before nectar each morning: Sapphire-vented Puffleg, Glowing Puffleg and
Rainbow-bearded Thornhill, Chalcostigma herrani.

By T. S. Johnstone (Stroud, Glos., England)
Aviculturally perhaps the greatest success at Slimbridge during the
last decade has been with the flamingos.
Before the first birds arrived, I was given the opportunity to visit those
establishments in Europe and America that had been successful in breeding
flamingos. My object was to gain information about their husbandry
particularly with regard to their diet, environment and colour preservation.
With this information, a lot of uncanny ' knowhow ' from the Hon.
Director, and a deal of experiment a system was evolved.
Starting with twenty Chilean Flamingos in 1961, the number was in
the autumn of 1972 over three hundred birds of all six forms as follows:--

45 Lesser flamingos {Phoeniconaias minor)
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99855356" page_id="56811534"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
The first breeding was that of the Caribbean in 1969 and since that
time 77 young of four forms have been reared. The only species that
has yet to lay is the James's.
The object of the exercise was to keep as large flocks as possible in as
extensive surroundings as possible and to maintain the birds natural
colour. We felt that these factors together with suitable winter quarters,
might well result in breeding flamingos for the first time in Great Britain.
The diet eventually evolved is a meal made up by milling equal
quantities of wheat, maize, poultry biscuit, turkey starter crumbs, dried
shrimp and fish meal. The meal is mixed with water to a consistency of
a thick soup. Minced lettuce, carrot and beetroot are added when
available and the soup is medicated with Tylan as a precaution against
respiratory diseases, to which James's Flamingo seems to be particularly
prone.
Inasmuch as the breeding pairs of birds have been those in the best
colour and that the colour is rapidly lost when the young birds are being
fed, it would seem fair to assume that colour preservation in captive
flamingos is a factor that facilitates successful breeding. Consequently the
effect of various additives to the feed on plumage was examined over the
first few years. It was found that the pigment canthaxanthine was the
most satisfactory and this together with the milk product Rhodophyll
are fed each morning mixed into the normal diet. A visit to Slimbridge
will show how effective this method has been.
The various forms are segregated into groups as they would be in the
wild. Apart from the Greater and Lesser flamingos which occur together

naturally, and plans are in hand to segregate these for breeding purposes,
the races are in separate pens and apart from the James's have com-
paratively large areas of water and mud over which to wander.
A great deal of trouble has gone into providing suitable nesting-sites
for the birds, and each flock has been provided with a carefully constructed
' Atoll To visitors these appear to be just a mud flat showing above
the water level. First of all the pond has to be drained and the mud
removed. Tons of hard core are then tipped onto the site of the island to
form a large oval, the edges of which, are brought up to within two ins. of
the water level. Concrete is then laid at an angle of 30* over this ridge
and as a causeway from the ridge to the feeding places on the banks of
the pond. At the narrow ends of the oval the ridge dips to below water
level in order to allow water to flow through the middle of the island.
Apart from the central channel the whole area inside the ridge is filled up
with a mixture of mud and sea-sand to some four ins. above the water.
It is essential that the water be kept at such a level as to keep the mud in a
consistency that the birds can build their nesting mounds without fear of
them disintegrating during the laying or incubating periods. Concrete
nests have been built and are quite satisfactory provided they are raised
up from the hard core to above the mud surface. Suitability of the
building material does seem to be of great importance. At New Grounds,
where the soil is heavy clay that bakes hard in the sun, one noted that
after a shower of rain during the summer, great building activity would
commence with softened mud. Assessing the amount of mud neccessary
for the flock is difficult as it is not practical to add to it during the nest
building activity. The nests are in the shape of flat topped cones some
18 ins. diameter at the base and 12-15 ins. at the top. The height varies
from nine to eighteen inches. When there are 20 or 30 nests this amount
of mud pulled up into heaps usually results in the nests being surrounded
with water and as the building continues for most of the incubation
period (28-32 days) in some cases the birds have found difficulty in
collecting enough mud with which to carry on.
Although flamingos seem able to survive in quite low temperatures, it
has been my experience that they are utterly miserable when left out in
the frost and snow of a Severn Valley winter. The fear of the birds
getting frozen in and the subsequent breaking of the tarsi when endeavour-
ing to release meant that something had to be done for the birds winter
comfort. I therefore built large winter houses over existing water
courses. Each house had to be close to a public foot-path and the side of
the building adjacent to the path had to be a continous window (for the
benefit of winter visitors). Strip lighting and infra-red heating are provided.
The floor is of concrete rendered in cement and sloping at an angle of 30*
to the water. Considerable difficulty was experienced in providing a
suitable surface, for the soles of the birds feet did not take kindly to the
cement. Peat, sand, sawdust and straw were tried, but each of these

became foul so quickly as to be impractical. Rubberised paint seemed at
first to be the solution. It was however found that the daily hosing and
brushing down destroyed the paint in a relatively short time. Finally
the floors have been covered with thin rubber sheeting which can be
easily removed or left in situ for washing purposes. In each house there
is a door over the water course and a small run adjoining so that the birds
can be let out on warm winter days.
After caring for flamingos for ten years, I feel the following observations
may be of interest to keepers of these interesting birds.
All species have been found to be easy to herd in and out of their
houses, always provided the exercise is carried out tentatively, and that a
recalcitrant bird is not chased. Any plan that can be evolved to avoid
catching and handling should be pursued. Handling a number of birds
usually results in one of them getting a tibio-tarsal joint damaged with,
inevitable fatal results. This policy means that the birds should be
pinioned on arrival. In our case, the birds have been feather-cut on
arrival and pinioned later on; but I think that immediate pinioning would
probably be safer. Of course in the Autumn, we have had to catch the
juveniles reared in the Summer for this purpose. In the last season
experiments have been made in pinioning the day old chicks on the nest,
which has been tried with the Greaters and the Chilean. In the case of
the former it was simplicity itself; one merely lifted the parent's wing,
took the chick, performed the necessary operation, and replaced it. Not
so with the Chilean. These would all leave the young and one had time
to pinion some, but there was a distinct possibility that the downies having
been handled would not stay in the nest, but would try to follow the
parents and one had the fear that when the parent returned, the baby would
not be able to climb back to safety.
It will be seen from the above that it has been found that the six species
of flamingos differ considerably in temperament. The Caribbean, which
are overlooked by the tea terraces and restaurant are the most apprehensive.
When the first member of the staff arrives in the morning, although
separated by a considerable stretch of water, the birds, even when nesting,
wall get up and rush to the farthest point. However as the day progresses
they recover and by the afternoon are quite oblivious of the many visitors
photographing them.
This initial apprehension does not occur with their cousins the Greater
Flamingos, for while they are laying and incubating, it is possible to walk
about amongst the nests and to put ones hand under an immovable bird;
in fact on being approached a vacant nest willbring the bird back to defend
it. Of course the fact that they are so gallant in defence of their nests does
not mean that they should be disturbed any more than is necessary for the
pinioning of the downies.
The Chilean behave midway between the Greaters and the Caribbean.
The feeder can approach within a few feet of an incubating bird, but the

nest will not be defended and a further advance results in the adults
leaving both eggs and young to the mercy of the intruder.
The Lesser Flamingo would appear to react as the Chilean, though as
we have had no young so far, the behaviour has yet to be observed.
The most phlegmatic are the two species from the High Andes, the
Andean, have a pen where their nesting atoll is within a yard of the public
albeit separated by a fence. Furthermore it is the end of the island
nearest to the public where the first nests are built.
The James's are in a pen through which the main pathway passes and
the birds like to roost on the tarmac surface. Here, very often, visitors
have to walk round them, obviously they get chivvied back on to the water.
Whilst it is believed that the chances of breeding flamingos is increased
by having large flocks, it is interesting to note that the Andean at New
Grounds number twenty birds and that as many as seven females have
laid in one year. A further point of interest is that only one pair have
produced fertile eggs. It was wondered whether this was due to the
difficulty for a pinioned male to balance himself properly during copulation
and it was proposed to feather cut the unpinioned wing to help with this
difficulty. Nevertheless as stated before over seventy flamingos have been
reared all by pinioned birds.
The normal number of eggs laid is one. On several occasions there
have been two eggs in a nest and in one case three eggs. In these cases
it has been the fact that two or three birds have laid the eggs.

THE EATING OF MEAT BY PARROTS

There is a tradition among Aviculturists that parrots are vegetarians
and that the eating of meat or any animal food will, among other things,
cause them to pluck their feathers. Nevertheless the relish with which
they eat meat points to a decided need for animal protein, certainly among
the larger parrots.
The first time this came to my notice was at the old Keston Foreign
Bird Farm before the war when we bred Blue Fronted Amazons. The
breeding pair came from the late Duke of Bedford's collection where they
had hatched young on several occasions and, if I remember rightly, the
chicks always died at an early age.
The Duke was a stickler for a vegetarian diet for parrots. I think the
birds were only given the usual seed, nuts, greenfood and fruit. When
they came to Keston, the late Mr. E. J. Boosey decided to supply them
with more bulk in their food when they hatched young, so they were given
boiled white fish, scrambled egg, boiled potato and rice pudding made
with milk. This they consumed eagerly and reared five beautiful young

D. H. S. RISDON--THE EATING OF MEAT BY PARROTS
and I can remember to this day the excitement of looking into a nest box
chock full of baby parrots.
Since we came to Rode, we have noted repeated cases of meat eating
among our macaws and cockatoos. This first started when our macaws
began to breed. Remembering what happened at Keston, as soon as
young were hatched the parents were offered extras in the way of bread
and butter, and soaked biscuit as well as chop bones and trimmings off
the joint which they consumed avidly. Incidentally the meat is always
cooked; they do not seem to like it raw, but they will eat raw sprats
holding them in one foot and greedily munching them from head to tail
as if they were eating a banana.
Our liberty macaws will descend on the bird food trolley as it goes
round the grounds in the morning and besides helping themselves to fruit,
readily take sprats and meat intended for the aviary birds.
If given a piece of bread liberally spread with butter, they will carefully
lick off all the butter before eating the bread. They also prefer shortbread
biscuit to other kinds of biscuit presumably because of its higher fat content.
The smaller parrots do not seem so keen on meat. This may be mainly
because they do not recognise it as food, but the larger cockatoos like
Moluccans and Sulphur Crested are equally keen on meat and fish.
What intrigues me is where would parrots get such food in the wild?
It could of course be a substitute for grubs. The beaks of parrots are
certainly designed for gouging into rotten wood, possibly in search of
these things, but they would have to find a great deal of this food to supply
them with what they seem to need. I find it hard to imagine any parrot
catching small active prey, although they might conceivably eat the eggs
and young of other birds.
Certain it is, however, that they have a distinct liking for food of an
animal origin and eat it so greedily that one gets the impression that they
are starving for it. The available literature on parrots in the wild only
gives a general description of their feeding habits. We all know that they
take grain, fruit, nuts, blossoms etc., but little seems to have been studied
as to exactly what they do eat. Perhaps some of our overseas members
who live in " parrot " country could enlighten us.

ASPECTS OF A NEW TROPICAL HOUSE FOR
BIRDS AT PADSTOW BIRD GARDENS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.962474575" page_id="56811539"  page_num="89" year="" vol="">
By Richard Mark Martin (Curator, Padstow Bird Gardens,
Cornwall, England)
Towards the end of 1971 we began work on the largest and most
important single development of these relatively new gardens--which
were opened to the public at Whitsun 1970. The, as it transpired to be,
accomplished intention was to have our new free-flight Tropical House
open by Easter 1972. Our financial circumstances dictated that we did
much of the work ourselves, only calling in specialists as and when
necessary. This arrangement worked surprisingly well, and I think we
all discovered new and unexpected talents.
The main purpose of these notes is twofold: one is briefly to explain
certain constructional details which I feel may be of interest and help to
others considering similar undertakings, while the other concerns the
establishing of plants and birds once the building was completed. That
others may benefit from our mistakes and successes is, in my opinion, one
of the justifications for our existence.
One conclusion which can be drawn straight away from our tropical
house enterprise is that the cost of establishing this kind of near-perfect
controlled habitat need not be nearly as prohibitive as one might think.
By careful choice of materials, a little basic constructional knowledge and
ability, a few extra pairs of hands from time to time and much hard work,
a roomy, if not massive, house similar to ours can be constructed for a sum
in the region of #2,000 to #3,000. This is inclusive of setting up the
boiler and heating system, and I have little doubt that most tropical houses
cost very much more than this.
We were fortunate, admittedly, in being able to make use of some
existing foundations and walls which to some extent governed the shape
and size of the building. The area had been used long ago as a greenhouse
and vegetable garden but all that remained were the very thick stone walls
which measured about two feet wide. At the rear, the wall was some
12 ft. high but at the front it was only 7 ft. We decided to point and make
good these walls, and at the front to add double-glazing--to effectively
heighten the wall to 11 ft. This we did and the result was to be a
pleasantly high and well-lit enclosure. (The ground dimensions can be
seen in the accompanying plan.)
We wanted a light yet strong roof with good heat insulation properties
but transparent enough not to hinder too much the passage of solar
illumination; on the other hand we did not want a totally transparent
material which would doubtless be a source of fright and frustration to
the birds housed therein. Eventually we plumped for a double skin of

Natural Translucent Filon supported by angled alum purlins, cross-tied
for additional rigidity.
But before we could go ahead with all this, the actual ground which at
that time resembled a scrap merchant's back-yard had to be cleared and
cleaned up. The pond, which is such an important feature of a tropical
house, was to be of a fairly simple shape mainly to facilitate the regular
daily cleaning necessary in the temperatures applicable to a simulated
sub-tropical habitat. I thought the plants and shrubs when established
would help to conceal its rather blatant artificiality. In addition we
constructed a shallow second pond at a higher level midway between a
recirculating waterfall, operated by a submersible pump in the main water
area, to a point some three feet above the higher pond. The idea behind
this subsidiary pond, apart from aestheticism, was as a bathing and
watering point for the more timid species, and the waterfall itself is
appreciated by some, especially sunbirds.
It was decided, without much difficulty, to confine the public to one
viewing area near the entrance. This type of arrangement is preferable
to a walk-through system in any but the largest of houses as it minimises
disturbance to what is the birds' territory, and thus improves breeding
prospects and probably cuts losses through egg-stealing, nest-destroying
and associated vandalism.
Probably the most intrinsic part of a tropical house situated in a
temperate country is the heating and ventilation system. We considered
many ideas before choosing an Afos C7 solo air heater which incorporated
piped water heating to help spread the output throughout the whole
building--a total area of approximately 10,360 cu. ft. This is a highly
versatile oil-fired boiler capable of many heating and ventilative tasks.
One 12 in. three-speed extractor fan was situated at the opposite end of
the building, but considering conditions experienced last summer, I feel
we were wrong not to fit a second fan. On hot days, in spite of the fan
working at maximum performance, the room temperature shot up alarm-
ingly to in excess of ioo*F at times, although I must admit that it affected
the public more than the birds! Normally we endeavour to maintain a
temperature between 55 and 65 *F through a room thermostat.
We took advantage of the heating facilities to locate an observation and
locust-breeding room and hospital adjoining the Tropical House, from
where we could keep a discreet eye on the birds (and public!). I was also
keen to construct some nesting sites within the dividing wall--into which
by virtue of glass panes we could observe and photograph any nesting
activities. It is still too soon to say if these will be successful.
By the time the actual construction work was finished Easter was
rapidly approaching. The next jobs were landscaping, perching and
planting. The first thing we did was to build a high long bank of earth
retained by large boulders at the far end of the flight, this we hoped would
be used for nesting in by kingfishers and bee-eaters. The acquisition of

plants, thanks to certain individuals and the Falmouth Parks Department,
did not prove difficult, and we soon had the soil prepared (by mixing in
many bales of peat) and the planting accomplished.
The logs and branches brought in for landscaping and perching reasons
helped to compensate for the bareness of the obvious new enclosure.
Even so, it looked little like the popular opinion of a jungle, and I was
afraid that the plants would take years to get established while, in the
meantime, the public would begin to mutter darkly. We needn't have
worried. I fancy by maintaining a high humidity through regular
spraying, and keeping the soil around the plants always moist, we encour-
aged rapid growth. Indeed, at the time of writing (January 1973), we
have just finished a massive pruning and cutting back operation, as one or
two of the plants were threatening to take over the entire building.
Especially vigorous and therefore to be recommended " tall plants "
were Cobaea scandens, the passion flower, angel's trumpet, morning glory,
Australian silk oak ( Grevillia robusta ), Abutilon thompsonii, jasmin, ' rubber
plant" ( Ficus elastica ), Fatsia japonica, bougainvillea, monstera, Clethra
alnifolia and perhaps surprisingly " busy lizzies "--which flourished from
the outset and still are. Among the low-growing plants, the familiar
nasturtium provided quick and efficient cover, and we have had to be quite
ruthless with it; a huge begonia has been in flower constantly since last
spring; amongst the others, Crinum powelii , a clivia and Pascicularia
pitlairnifolia have all done well.
The first of the avian inhabitants were to be a pair of Sunbitterns
(Eurypyga helias) --who quickly made themselves at home and especially
liked to skulk in a thick clump of bamboo which we had planted. Following
on their heels was a consignment of excellent African birds from Tim
and Jane Barnley in Kenya. Included in this consignment were Black-
winged Stilts {Himantopus h. himantopus ), African Jacanas {Actophilornis
africanus), Woodland Kingfishers {Halcyon senegalensis), Tacazze and
Malachite Sunbirds ( Nectarinia tacazze and N. famosa) and a Collared
Pratincole {Glareola nuchalis). Soon after these were established success-
fully we were able to add Green-backed Tits {Farm monticolus) from
India, Zebra Doves {Streptopelia striata ) and some Yellow-rumped
Tanagers ( Ramphocelus icteronotus ).
By and large there were few acclimatisation problems. We were forced
to remove a male Malachite Sunbird as the " true pair " of Tacazzes were
preventing it from feeding, and I think it very likely that we will breed
these in 1973 (at least I am hoping so!). We were unfortunate with our
Green-backed Tits: one was killed, presumably by a Sunbittern, before
it had learnt its way about, and a replacement hanged itself
quite recently; this was a great shame as they were obviously content.
The Collared Pratincole, which was acclimatising nicely, was found one
day, four months after its arrival, in the pond with severe brain damage.
In spite of all our efforts it died the next day. I feel it likely that it flew

into one of the purlins (they definitely form a hazard), although one must
not overlook the possibility of vandalism as it occurred in the middle of
August. I have my doubts about the suitability of these birds to captive
life as they are so obviously as much birds of the air as even the Hirundines.
This was the sum of our teething troubles, and, I think, does not
reflect too badly. Our aim within the Tropical House is to house only
the more compatible species, and for this reason have precluded members
of the magpie family Cracticidae and other large omnivores. These get
along admirably outside where they can have a flight to themselves, and I
hope our future breeding results justify this policy.
We are also precluding flamingos, ibis and other relatively large and
gregarious water birds for hygienic reasons. Through past experiences
I know the difficulties of keeping the soil of indoor aviaries " sweet " in
the face of such fierce competition!

A POSSIBLE METHOD OF SEXING
THICK-BILLED PARROTS
(Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha)
By George A. Smith (Peterborough, Northants, England)

Thick-billed Parrots are very large conures--about i ft. 3ms. (38cms.)
long and with an average weight (15 individuals) of 300 g (over half a
pound)--lowest weight 265 g, highest 330 g. A good, indeed the only,
illustration of this macaw-like parrot that I know of occurs in the
Avicultural Magazine 1927, p. 89. A rough description would be to
image a heavy-headed, black-billed parrot of a uniform dulled green with
the bend of the wing, face and thighs clearly marked with a deep blood-red.
The tail not being quite as elongated as with many conures and macaws.
Although it is not included by Greenway in his Extinct and Vanishing
Birds oj the World (1958), in Extinct and Vanishing Animals by V. Ziswiler
(1967) nor in The Red Book by Fisher, Simon and Vincent (1969) it is,
according to the International Zoo Year Book, listed as being an endangered
species. Several Zoos now provide suitable accomodation for its breeding
and it has been illustrated (where the artist has made it resemble a pigeon!)
on the 2 \ p. Jersey ' Wildlife in danger ' series of postage stamps.
It is possible that some confusion as to its rarity might have occured
because of a mix-up with the Maroon-fronted parrot, R. ( pachyrhyncha ?)
terrisi , of which Blake, in his Birds of Mexico (1953), says ' unlike the
Thick-billed Parrot this species is decidedly rare and occupies a very
limited range '. The distribution of the Thick-billed Parrot is said to be
over a large part of western and central Mexico where they are especially

characteristic of highland pine forests from Sierra Madre Occidental
southwards over the central plateau to Michoacan occasionally being
recorded as far east as Veracruz and as far north as Southern Arizona.
As Thick-billed Parrots subsist largely on pine seed--a wild crop--even
though this seed has commercial value as pinones and because water
catchment areas have increased value if afforested it might be thought to
be reasonably safe from immediate extinction. The authorities in Mexico
responsible for supervising exports of native birds seem not to regard it
as needing protection for many (ioo-f) have been recently imported into
the U.K.. Breeding must continue in the wild for about a third of these
imports, I am told, were juveniles with white streaks to the beaks.
Recently I examined fifteen dead Thick-bills. Sexing neotropical
parrots is not easy but a friend, on looking at these corpses, correctly
sorted out an adult male and female by the difference in boldness about
the head and beak, though held his opinion about most of the others.
The actual measurements of maximum beak widths, in millimetres was:

Again our breeding pair of European Eagle-Owls {Bubo bubo) hatched
three fine chicks on 12th, 14th, and 16th March. The mother is well
accustomed to people watching her closely and never feels disturbed
during nesting time. So we are lucky in not having to provide her with
a straw-screen, and the Eagle-Owls are one of the very first spring attrac-
tions for the public every year.
The Black Swans {Cygnus atratus) fortunately got their young in a fairly
fine time in March. Usually these Australians hatch their young during
their " natural " springtime, which means winter in Europe.

Two Takahes were hatched at the Mount Bruce Native Bird Reserve
in New Zealand on Christmas Day 1972. This blue and green flightless
species was believed to be extinct until 1948 when it was rediscovered in
the mountainous, inhospitable country west of Lake Te Anau in the
South Island. Fewer than 500 exist and every effort is being made at
Mount Bruce to help conserve the species. Part of the conservation
programme includes a determined attempt to breed the bird in captivity.
Although wild caught chicks have been reared, and adults have nested
before at Mount Bruce, this is the first occasion on which fertile eggs have
been produced. I visited the Reserve in February of this year and was
dismayed to learn that both the chicks had died because they had congenital
abnormalities of the alimentary tract. However, the parent birds were
making very good foster parents for a young Pukeko. As a parrot
enthusiast I was very impressed by the success which the Reserve is
having with parrakeets of the genus Cyanoramphus. Considerable
numbers of the Yellow-fronted and Red-fronted species have been bred
and, since my previous visit in 1969, several of the All Green Antipodes
Island and the large Antipodes Island Red-crowned species. I believe
that neither of these two members of the genus has been bred in captivity
before.

It has been estimated that more than a hundred Amboina King Parrots
of at least two different sub-species were imported in 1972. It is
gratifying that most appear to have survived and several parrakeet breeders
are now the proud possessors of potential breeding pairs. In this context
it is interesting that although one of the sub-species has already been bred
in this country the event was not well documented and appears to have
escaped the notice of most people interested in parrakeet breeding.
The successful rearing of a male and a female Salawati King took place
in the late Duke of Bedford's Collection at Hayward's Heath when it
was in the care of F. Gorman. The event is described very briefly in
the Magazine of the Foreign Bird League (1940).

Since 1964, 25 Kea Parrots have been reared at the Zurich Zoo.

Breeding results 1972.
Mats Tell, Ljungbyhed:
" This season my parrakeets have been fairly successful and the following
young were reared: five Stanleys, five Redrumps, one Manycoloured
(which was reared by a pair of Stanleys), one Turquoisine and eleven
Bourke's. My Red Cardinals have four young which have now moulted
into adult plumage; they proved to be two cocks and two hens and they
are really magnificent birds. My softbills have failed. My old cock
Silver-eared Mesia died after one day's illness and the hen of my second
pair came into a heavy, and too early, moult. The hen Pekin Robin,
which has been in my possession for nine years, would not lay although
the pair had a complete nest. The Blue-winged Sivas had their first
three eggs infertile and the newly-hatched chicks of their second clutch
were immediately eaten by the female.
W. Langberg, Copenhagen: " I had young Pileated, Rock Peplar,
Crimson-winged, Pennant's (the lesser red from North Australia),
Princess of Wales, Blue Ring-necked and Blue-winged Parrakeets, Lutino
and Pied Cockatiels, Spectacled Parrotlets and Cherry, Diggle's, Bicheno
and Peale's Parrot-finches. The King Parrots had infertile eggs and the
Leadbeater's Cockatoos laid but would not sit. "
E. Norgaard-Olesen, Janderup: " I bred one Loriculus vernalis and
one L. galgulus. Several of my Tanagers had eggs but none succeeded. "
Dr. L. F. Baptista: " Dr. Hans Lohrl, the director of the Max Planck
Institut fur Verhaltenphysiologie Vogelwarte Radolfzell , has twice bred the
Parrotbill {Paradoxornis webbiana ). The first egg of the first clutch of
six was laid on 12th May 1971. Three eggs were removed for protein
studies and substituted with three flycatcher eggs so that the parrotbills
could incubate a normal clutch size. Two Parrotbills hatched and were
removed when seven days old and hand-reared in connection with Dr.
Lohrl's behavioural studies. A second clutch of five was started on
28th June 1971. Three young hatched, two of which were raised to
maturity by their parents. The eggs of a third clutch were removed.
This is very likely a first breeding for the genus in captivity. Jean
Delacour's breeding of Paradoxornis fulvifrons (Avicultural Magazine,
1973, 79 &amp;gt; t8) is probably a second record for the genus. In 1971 Dr. Lohrl
also bred the Wallcreeper ( Tichodroma muraria). Two young were raised
to maturity by their parents. The Wallcreepers are now on display at
the Innsbruck Zoo. Some of the Parrotbills were sent to the Basel and
Frankfurt Zoos.
E. Williams, Hambledon: " nine Splendid Parrakeets from four pairs,
eight Turquoisines from three pairs, six Elegants from two pairs, five
Bourke's from three pairs, one Golden-Mantled Rosella from two pairs
and two Pennant's from two pairs. No Many-coloured were reared from
three pairs and Blue-wings did not go to nest ".

three Mealy Rosella, four Stanley, five Turquoisine, five Yellow Red-rump,
three Quaker and three Lutino Ring-necked Parrakeets. My Yellow-
fronted New Zealand Parrakeets had five chicks which they let die--
last year they reared some lovely birds. My Cape Parrots arrived too
late in the season to breed. My latest arrivals are two pairs Iris Lorrikeets,
one pair Dusky Lories, one pair Yellow-streaked Lories, one pair Everett's
Blue-backed Parrots and one pair of Blue-naped Mousebirds ".

REVIEW
REVIEW
THE PARROTS OF SOUTH AMERICA. By Rosemary Low.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99684087804878" page_id="56811556"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
London: John Gifford, 1972. Price ^3*25p.
Although Central and South America contain the greater part of the
world's parrot species, very little information has been available in the
past, in spite of the amount written about the relatively smaller number of
Australian species. With the shift of sources of bird imports over the
years an increasing variety of American parrots have become available to
the aviculturist, who at times has found it difficult to discover which
species he had. Rosemary Low's book is therefore an important addition
to parrot literature, as the only work specifically covering this region.
The book is written for the aviculturist and the text constantly reflects
the author's considerable experience in the keeping of these birds. The
opening chapters on purchase, accommodation, feeding, general care, and
breeding contain a lot of good practical advice.
The parrots themselves are grouped in five chapters--headed Macaws,
Conures, Parrakeets and Parrotlets, Small Parrots, and Amazons. This
section brings out one shortcoming of the book. Some 144 species and
their subspecies are involved, but there is no general key to the identification
of the different types of South American parrots and their species groups.
Those familiar with some of the birds may find this satisfactory, but the
beginner with an unknown bird might need to work through most of the
text to identify it. There is an identification key for the Amazon species,
and something of this kind would have been a help elsewhere--with the
Pyrrhura species for instance.
Each genus or natural group of smaller genera is introduced with a
general text, differing considerably in length, seemingly related to the
extent to which the birds are kept, but usually containing information on
the suitability of the species as pets or aviary birds, and sometimes on
their general keeping and breeding. Following this birds are dealt with
as species and subspecies. The text for each, where sufficient information
is available, includes alternative popular names, and a brief description of
adult and immature birds. Distribution is given, varying from precise
habitat data where available, to a brief statement of geographical region.
This is followed by a section headed" remarks " which usually gives
information on the extent to which the species has been imported and
kept by aviculturists, together with various pieces of information, and
quotations from published sources, of the general demeanour and needs
of the birds; as well as any facts which are not covered by more specific
headings. Finally there are sections on breeding results, with data on
captive breedings.
The arrangement is a little difficult to follow at times owing to the
treatment of subspecies. In recent revisions of parrot classification birds

which were earlier thought to be separate species have been grouped
together under one name. In the present work species and subspecies
are often listed with similar headings. Separate English names may be
used in each case without a clear indication, other than in the abbreviated
Latin name, as to which is involved. Some subspecies are, however,
listed with only subsidiary headings, and a few with no indication of how
they differ from the described forms. This may reflect the degree of
avicultural interest in the birds concerned, and from that viewpoint the
arrangement may be satisfactory, but otherwise it does not commend
itself. I feel that the species unit should have been more clearly indicated,
and that the popular names for subspecies should have been less prominent.
In the plates 42 species are illustrated by colour photographs. There
is an appendix note on the taking of, such photographs; and one on
known abnormal plumage variations in these species. In spite of
criticism the book is a useful and timely addition to avicultural literature.

HANGING PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992711285714286" page_id="56811557"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
My first recollection of Hanging Parrots was at a National Cage Bird show.
The second time was in Singapore, on my first visit to three of the bird shops,
where they each had a small number of Blue Crowned.
The next time I saw this group was during this voyage at Goa, where we were
loading Iron Ore. It was on the second day there; a young man came on board
with four Vernal's. At the time, I had no intention of acquiring any as my hopes
were for Sunbirds or any insectivorous birds. One of the assistant stewards, who
takes home small parrot-like birds for his father, acquired them for a shirt. Later,
through an Anglo-Indian boy, I found out they were to be had in town for as low
as 1 op. I have since found out at home they cost between #5 an d #7 a pair,
which is certainly a great contrast. Two more boys bought two each in the
following days and the same Indian boy had six more the day we sailed for Japan.
In Japan, I acquired five of them as their previous owners did not wish the
birds to mess up their newly acquired electrical equipment. At the time of
writing, I have had them for a month. In this time I have noticed that each has
its own character.
They sit for most of the day on top of the bell-like cage moving down to the
table, on which it stands, for food and water. Each morning when I uncover
them, as I always put them in at night, the most nervous one is always the first out.
It makes straight for the water which I have just put down. It proceeds to dip
only its head and breast, then climb up the cage to preen itself. Another makes for the
food dish, looks in and then up to the top of the cage. The other three remain
inside. Nothing more happens until I have left the cabin. On my return, about
an hour later, they are all on the carpet with the exception of one which is always
on my bunk, as it can fly quite well.
I feed them on sponge cake, which one can easily get on a ship, which has gone
a little stale then soaked in diluted honey and a little fruit. This diet appears to
be quite adequate as their droppings are soft, semi-solid and normal in appearance.

They do not seem to mind noise at all, even sudden ones, as I play my tape-
recorder when ever I get the opportunity at a reasonably good volume. They
appear to like certain pieces more than others as they come to life even joining in
with chirps and squeaks. Their voices are heard, at other times, only occasionally
so they are the least offensive of parrots.
I would have liked to have kept these five, but being away at sea this is impossible.
I have asked Mr. B. Reed, another of our members, if he can find a home for them.
One of their habits, of which they have just reminded me, is the rubbing or scraping
of the tongue on their bills giving quite a load rasping sound. Why they do this
I can only guess: to clean the tongue or the beak.
In his book Whistler says that, " iris yellowish white; bill coral red, tip yellow;
cere darker red", but in my five the bill is orange with a hint of red in two and
the eye is completely dark. In the book the iris colour is clearly indicated in the
monochrome illustration. Are my birds young ones and do these features change
with age? Can any member more experienced with this group comment on this
matter?

By Derek Washington (East Grinstead, Sussex, England)
It would seem that no one has yet published an account of breeding
House Sparrows Passer domesticus in captivity in Britain. This lack of
information was brought to light by C. J. O. Harrison (Avicultural
Magazine 77 (1971) 131-135 and 78 (1972) 205-209) and the second of
his lists finally pricked my concience and stimulated me to prepare these
notes. The following account describes breeding attempts, some
successful and some not, between the years 1967 and 1971. Further
interest is added by the fact that the male parent was abnormally coloured,
and that this abnormality was not inherited by any of the offspring, even
when the male was paired back to his daughter.
Towards the end of 1966 I was given an unrelated pair of House
Sparrows. The female was normal in colour, but the male was paler
than normal. He showed all the markings of a male, but the colours
were reduced in intensity giving an overall fawn appearance. The
normally black bib, for example, was dark grey and the chestnut regions
on the neck were light brown. The bill was a yellowish horn colour,
even in summer when it should be black, and the eyes appeared red when
viewed with a bright light directly behind the observer.
For convenience, I shall refer to this bird as dilute, though this may not
be scientifically accurate. I am not certain of the origin of these birds
but believe they were taken from the wild.
In 1967 they were kept in a large double breeder cage in my garden
shed at Redhill in Surrey. They were given a Budgerigar nestbox, but
made no attempts to use it. Food at this time (April) consisted of a
soaked seed mixture up as follows:-- 2 parts British Finch mixture, 2 parts
wild seeds, 1 part niger. Each bird consumed about i\ teaspoons of
this mixture daily. A good supply of maggots was always available, also
sweet apple and coltsfoot.
On 30th April I transferred the birds to an aviary measuring 12 ft. x
7 ft. x 7 ft. high. The rear wall was timber, covered on the inside with
bunches of heather. The rear ft. of roof was also timber to provide
shelter. The aviary already contained one pair each of the following
species:--Canary, Bullfinch, Greenfinch, Goldfinch, Siskin and Redpoll.
Within minutes of their release in the aviary the male House Sparrow
started chasing his female all over the place in a most excited manner.

DEREK WASHINGTON--BREEDING THE HOUSE SPARROW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9980478" page_id="56811566"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
Fresh wild seeding plants were given daily as they became available;
for example in June I saw the House Sparrows eating chickweed, sow
thistle and plantain. In spite of frequent chasing by the male no nesting
activity was noticed until 6th June, when an attempt was made to build
a nest high among the heather under the covered roof. There was very
little material to act as foundation, so I fixed a Budgerigar nestbox at this
spot. This suited the birds fine, though not in the way I expected. They
built on top of the box, sandwiching their nest between it and the roof--
a height of two to three inches. One result of this was that the nesting
chamber had a hard wooden floor with no lining over it. The nest was
rapidly constructed from dry grasses and some of the various plants
which were offered to the birds as food, such as long stems of great
plantain. A sparse lining of feathers was subsequently added.
The first egg appeared on 13th June, followed by three others at daily
intervals. Incubation appeared to be by the female alone. On 25th
June I noticed a sudden increase in the rate of maggot consumption, and
assumed the eggs were hatching. On the following day I gingerly felt
in the nest and found three chicks and an egg. This egg did not hatch
and disappeared within the next two days. The Handbook gives an
incubation period of 12 to 14 days, starting from the completion of the
clutch. In the present case there were certainly young in the nest 10
days after the last egg was laid, and probably as soon as nine days after.
On 1 st July I examined the nestlings. One had a deformed leg with
the knee joint apparently working the wrong way round, so that the leg
was pointed forwards towards the wing. At the time I wondered whether
this might be a consequence of the very shallow nest with its hard wooden
floor. The other two young were ringed with the recommended B.B.B.A.
rings, size B3. These would barely go on, although the young were
probably only five or six days old. Later on the legs became much
thicker and the soft fleshy surface bulged out over the rings. This
worried me, and I managed to cut the rings off without harm to the birds.
A bigger ring would not solve this problem as I had been able without
difficulty to fit B3 rings on to the legs of both parents when they were
adults. The House Sparrow is one of those species which exhibits
" puppy fat ", that is the legs of nestlings are thicker than those of adults.
Some measurements of a subsequent brood showing this phenomenon
are given later in the article. It seems likely that close rings are un-
suitable for this species.
All three young appeared to have normally coloured skin with no
trace of any pale features. They differed from the young of other species
I was breeding, Greenfinches for example, in showing no traces of fluffy
down. They were simply bald and ugly, with a few quills beginning
to push through.
By 7th July I was able to offer daily supplies of blackfly on stems of
dock and thistle, but I did not notice the Sparrows eating these. They

were nervous birds, however, and I continued with the blackfly in the
hope that they were being taken after I left the aviary. On this day I
found the chick with the deformed leg dead in the nest.
The remaining two young left the nest on 14th July. During the
rest of the summer I gave supplies of all manner of wild seeds as these
came into season. Both birds were successfully reared, and proved to be
one of each sex and normal in colour. Both had slightly deformed toes
on each foot. I kept the female to pair back to her father, and released
the male.
In 1968 I moved house from Redhill to East Grinstead in Sussex.
The three Sparrows were caged in February whilst their aviary was
dismantled. On 21st April they were released into their new aviary.
This measured 12 ft. x 9 ft. x 7 ft. high, approximately 3 ft. of the rear
wall was boarded from ground to roof and attached to a 3 ft. square
boarded section of the roof. The rear of the aviary was heavily planted
with evergreen shrubs and some elderberry bushes. The aviary con-
tained three Budgerigar nestboxes and a tit nestbox of a type known as
the Upton permanent box (see British Trust for Ornithology Field
Guide No. 3 " Nestboxes " by Edwin Cohen).
Other inhabitants of this new aviary were 10 finches of various species,
a Collared Dove, and a Black-headed Gull with only one wing. There
were a few differences from the previous year in the food available. All
seeds were given dry, not soaked. Separate dishes contained British
finch mixture, sunflower, peanuts, wheat, dove and pheasant mixture
and wild seed mixture. Soft foods were also offered, again in separate
dishes. These were soaked puppy biscuit, egg biscuit food and bread
and milk sprinkled with calcium phosphate. As many wild seeding
plants were offered as possible, species varying according to the season.
On 28th April the Upton permanent box contained some dead grass
and the adult female Sparrow was seen to visit it. The male House
Sparrow was very energetic, often displaying and chasing this, his original,
mate. By 8th May a lot of material had been added to the nest and a
lining, mostly of seed fluff, was being added. Three days later I added
a daily supply of maggots to the diet.
On 18th May there were five eggs in the box, and the adult female
was incubating. During the evening of the 25th I felt in the nest and
the eggs were quite cool. I wondered if the hen had deserted, but on the
29th the rate of maggot consumption increased about four times, and on
the following morning there were certainly young in the nest. That
evening (30th May) there were four chicks and a clear egg. In spite of
earlier difficulties I decided to ring these young with smaller than the
recommended B3 rings (inside diameter =3 mm) this time using the
2-6 mm B2, as I knew the B3 ring could be fitted on to adults. By 4th
of June it looked as though there was another puppy fat problem, however,
and to prevent further constriction I cut through the rings with fine

wire cutters, subsequently pulling them open sufficiently for removal
using two pairs of surgical forceps. I tried fitting the larger B3 ring on
this day, but it would not go on. Next day I put on plastic Budgerigar
split rings for identification. These were coloured green, blue, black
and white.
On 7th June I measured the length of web open on the primary feathers
as an indication of their stage of development. I also measured tarsus
thickness to check on the puppy fat problem. The birds ringed black
and white left the nest on 12th June, whilst Green and Blue fledged the day
after. Further tarsus measurements were taken on 18th June, details are
given in Table 1.

There was thus a reduction in tarsus thickness between the probable
ages of 9 and 20 days of up to 0*4 mm. (Tarsus measurements were
made to the nearest 0-05 mm using vernier calipers. Every effort was
made to measure consistently to minimise experimental error). The
results illustrate the puppy fat problem and give some measure of the
difficulties faced when close ringing this species.
On 14th June, the day after the last young fledged, I noticed a drop in
the rate of maggot consumption by about 30%; at the same time more
bread and milk was being eaten. Two weeks later three of the young
were seen feeding together on freshly gathered chickweed.
The young were all normal in colour.
All the Sparrows were nervous and would hide if they knew I was
around. Sometimes though I could watch their behaviour from the
house (about 80 ft. away) using binoculars. 16th June at about 11 a.m.
was one such occasion when I watched the male and the breeding female
mating. I did not see the start of this sequence, the unusual activity
prompted me to fetch my binoculars. The female was on a sloping perch
about two feet from the nest box, she was quivering her wings. The
male flew round the aviary several times (clockwise if viewed from above),
briefly pausing now and then on perches or on top of the nest box. He
then quickly mounted the female from behind. During copulation she
stopped quivering her wings, but the male flapped his vigorously as if
to keep balance. They remained like this for only 2 or 3 seconds, then
the male flew off for 5 to 10 seconds and returned and repeated the per-
formance. This happened eight times in all. The female remained

stationary except once when she moved a couple of inches down the perch
between matings. The female interrupted the sequence by flying away.
Two days later the first egg of the second clutch was laid in the same nest.
The nest contained two eggs on 20th June (late afternoon) and four
on the 23rd. July 1st still saw four eggs, but on the 5th there were four
naked young in the nest. Late in the afternoon of the following day I
watched the male eating bread and milk, he then flew to the nestbox
and went in for about five seconds. There was much cheeping as he
entered. When he left he flew straight to the female and the other young
hidden in the shrubs. I noticed that the female always left the nest at
this time if I went to the aviary.
On the 10th the four nestlings were well feathered and, once again,
normal in colour; one was smaller than the others. Three days later I
ringed them with Budgerigar split plastic rings--Red, Dark Green,
Red &amp; Black and Red &amp; White. Next day I moved the 1st round to
another aviary, and on the 18th the second brood left the nest.
On 21 st July the smallest bird, Black &amp; Red, was found to have inturned
feet and pronounced fault bars across the tail (bars indicating a dietary
deficiency at intervals during the growth of the feathers). On 5th August
this bird was found drowned in the water dish. Red &amp; White also had
fault bars on the tail and one slightly twisted foot, the other two appeared
to be perfect.
On 17th August Black and White (1st round birds) were moulting
black bibs, and obviously were males. Blue and Green eventually
proved to be females.
At the end of the month I could not find Dark Green (2nd round) or
the mother, and realized that they must have escaped when the feeding
hatch was left open accidentally a few days earlier. Green (1st round)
seemed to be fittest female so I put her with her father on 14th September,
having removed Red, Red &amp; White and the 1967 bred daughter two
weeks earlier. Having been without a female for two weeks the male
was most excited at the introduction of Green. He chased her all round
the aviary. Whenever he managed to perch near her he adopted a
posture with drooping wings, open beak and a slightly fanned tail which
he flicked up irregularly about twice a second. Several times the female
clung to one of the wire netting aviary sides. This prompted the male
to jump around her landing on the wire netting, as if forming a circle
about three feet in diameter with the hen at the centre. At times she
sheltered in a dense shrub, whereupon the male kept jumping to and fro
along a nearby sloping perch. Unfortunately I did not observe, or did
not record, the end of this activity.
I have no more relevant notes concerning these birds until April 1969
when I released all the remaining young except for the female, Blue, who
was placed in a separate aviary as a reserve. On 28th April I discovered
that Green had one egg in the Upton permanent box.

The food given was similar to that of the previous year as far as seeds,
wild foods and maggots was concerned. However, I decided to experi-
ment with the soft food to see if I could overcome the problem of some
chicks having deformed feet. Instead of separate dishes of soaked puppy
biscuit, egg biscuit food, and bread and milk sprinkled with calcium
phosphate I made up the following mixture:-- i part breadcrumbs,
2 parts puppy biscuit (Saval number i), 2 parts chick crumbs, and 1 part
Farex. To 1 lb of this mixture I added one teaspoon of calcium phosphate
and half a teaspoon of Lusty's Pure Kelp Powder (rich in minerals and
made from seaweed). This was moistened with water when supplied
fresh daily.
On 10th May there were three eggs in the Upton permanent box, but
the female seemed to have deserted them. The male no longer showed
any interest in her, but he was often excited by wild females outside the
aviary. I decided to add his other daughter, Blue, to this aviary, and
also put in a new tit nest box. Next day the male was seen entering
the new box, and a nest was being built in it on x8th May. By then
there were only two eggs in the old box, both cold. I removed these and
put them under a broody Canary. These eggs had a pale greyish ground
colour, one was spotted and mottled all over with greys and browns,
the other only had a little of this pattern at the thick end (the Handbook
states that one egg in a set is usually much lighter than the rest). The
fostering experiment was a flop as both eggs were clear.
On 26th May there was one egg in the new box; subsequently two more
were added, but I did not discover which female had laid them. By
14th June these eggs were deserted, but Green had four eggs in the old
box. One week later Green had one tiny chick and three eggs, whilst
nest material was being placed over the eggs in the new box. Green's
remaining three eggs failed to hatch, and the chick was eventually found
dead on the ground. It was well feathered and normal in colour (this
was the first offspring from the pairing dilute male x daughter).
In 1970 I continued experimenting with the diet. I reverted to
bread and milk sprinkled with calcium phosphate as the main soft food.
This time however no maggots were given. Green had vanished by June
and I presumed that she had died or escaped. On 3rd June Blue had
five eggs in the Upton permanent box. One had hatched by the 12th,
when I started giving about 40 mealworms daily. No other eggs hatched
and the chick subsequently died as it was becoming feathered. This chick
too was normal in colour.
In 1971 I added two pairs of Zebra Finches to the aviary. One pair
nested in the Upton permanent box and I eventually found Blue dead
wedged in the hole of this box. She appeared to be both going in and
turning to get out. I suppose she was driven away by the Zebra Finch.
As the Sparrow's corpse was like a cork in a bottle the poor Zebra Finch
could not get out to feed, and she too was dead when I found them. Later

that year the old male Sparrow also vanished, bringing this experiment
to a close.
I think the main point about the rearing of healthy undeformed
young was that this only occurred when there was a plentiful supply
of both maggots and bread and milk sprinkled with calcium phosphate.
I do not know for certain that these are essential but I would use them
again if trying to breed this species, except that I would probably use a
multi-mineral/vitamin powder such as Vionate in preference to calcium
phosphate.
Finally a few words on the failure to breed coloured or dilute birds
may be of value. One fact which emerges is that this is not a sex-linked
recessive type (as found in cinnamon Canaries for example). If it were
sex-linked the dilute male paired to a normal female would have produced
split dilute males and dilute females; however, all the females were normal
in colour. If a non sex-linked recessive factor was involved all the young
would have been split dilute, i.e. normal in colour, and young from the
father x daughter mating should include both dilutes and split birds of
normal colour. The two young actually produced from this mating
were both normal in colour, but such a small sample does not rule out the
possibility of a non sex-linked recessive factor.

A COLLECTION OF RARE BIRDS NEAR PARIS
By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
Some twenty miles north of Paris, at * le Clos du Cedres ', Mesnil
Aubry, Dr. Henry Quinque has gathered an unusual collection of rare
birds, particularly Parrots and Parrakeets.
Born at Limoges, he was initiated to aviculture by our late member
U. A. Decoux who for many years maintained in the vicinity, at Gery,
an outstanding collection of Parrakeets, Doves and small birds, often
writing about them for this magazine. Dr. Quinque still keeps there the
more usual species of Broadtails and other Parrakeets, in his mother's
garden.
It is at Mesnil-Aubry, however, that he has installed his rarer birds.
The accommodation consists essentially of a vast block of 30 aviaries
designed for Parrots. Each flight is 40 ft. long, 4 ft. wide and 6 ft. high
and it has a heated shelter. They are elaborately built of steel and
concrete, with all sorts of modern devices for the welfare of the occupants.
A long indoor corridor and an open air one serve the aviaries at both ends.
Other aviaries are found in different parts of the grounds, inhabited by
other Parrakeets and also by some rare passerine birds, particularly
Rothschild's Mynahs, Red Birds of Paradise and a few others.

The small park surrounding the house is walled-in and has a large pond:
Cranes, Flamingos and Waterfowl live there at semi-liberty, as well as a
few mammals. A pair of Kagus inhabit an enclosure.
The following species of Parrots and Parrakeets are represented at
present at Mesuil-Aubry:
Great Palm Cockatoo: A pair, plus a tame male, over 40 years old, which
used to be U. Decoux's pet. Gang-gang Cockatoo: Three pairs in perfect
condition, which have not yet started breeding. Queen of Boavaria&amp;apos;s
Conure: Several tame young specimens, recently arrived. Amboina King
Parrot: Also several lately arrived. Australian King Parrot: Regularly
breeding pairs. New Guinean and Australian Crimson Wings , also
regular breeders. Horned Parrakeet: A male of this very rare New
Caledonion species. Uvea Parrakeet: Two males of this rare species,
one of which has produced hybrids with a female Red-fronted Kakariki ,
several pairs of which live and breed there. Rock Peplars: Regularly
breeding. Twenty-eight, Port Lincoln , Cloncurry and Brown's Parrakeets.
The latter reared a number of young, but Dr. Quinque has some difficulty
in keeping them alive after the first six months. A fine pair of Pesquefs
Parrot has recently been added to the collection.
Of the smaller species one finds a number of pairs of Manycoloured
Hooded and Naretha Blue-bonnets which are breeding very successfully.,
Swainson&amp;apos;s and Scaly Lorikeets are also present, as well as some wild-
caught Cockatiels.
We hope that Dr. Quinque will soon report personally on his breeding
successes with his rarer birds.

BREEDING THE BLACK-HEADED SIBIA
(Heterophasia capistrata)
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Bucks., England)
I obtained a pair of Black-headed Sibias, Heterophasia capistrata , from

a Buckinghamshire dealer in February 1971. At first glance these birds
are difficult to sex, but on closer scrutiny of this pair the hen has one or two
pale grey primary feathers in the wings, and while the cock is bold the
hen is much less tame. Both birds are mainly chestnut-brown, with
black crests, and a long tail the feathers of which have grey and black
terminal bars.
Their flight is short and jerky and they seem to jump from perch to
perch like their relatives the mesias, Leiothrix species. They call con-
tinually with small babbling notes. The only time I heard what might
be called a slight song was when they paired up before nesting. On a few
occasions, associated with what appeared to be a nesting display, I heard
a peculiar noise rather like a cat mewing two or three times in succession.

This was followed by the cock chasing the hen at a terrific speed round the
aviary and in and out of a bamboo clump, and attempting to peck the
cloaca of the female. Presumably this proceeds copulation. Cloaca-
pecking in babbler courtship has been recorded for other species (Harrison
1967).
With regard to diet, all that I can persuade them to feed on are grapes,
cut up small, and a continual supply of " nectar " which consists of honey,
Complan, and Farlene Baby Food mixed with water. I have tried the
usual proprietary soft foods but they refuse to touch any. Apart from
insects which they " hawk " on the wing this is their basic diet. 1971 was
a good year for wasps and they really relish these, it is fascinating to see
them hold a wasp down with one foot and remove the sting. Sometimes
they don't bother and just swallow the wasp whole.
After wintering them in the bird room (which is kept reasonably warm
by electric heating in bad weather) they were put out into a flight in the
second week of March 1971. The flight was 4m. x 2m x 2m x and planting
and planting with a clump of bamboo and some ferns.
They showed no interest in breeding in 1971. As with my Silver-
eared Mesias, I overwintered them in the bird room with a pair of Spreo
Starlings. On 12th March 1972, when the weather was rather cold, but
fairly fine, I put them out in the planted flight again, but this year I fixed
up a trellis in the flight and trained some wild hops to climb it.
In May I obtained some fibre from a Palm tree, the same material that
the Silver-eared Mesia had used (Franklin 1972).
On 30th May the cock was seen to carry some of the fibres about the
flight. On 10th June I saw him display to the hen with a long strand
held in his bill, raising his crest and vibrating his wings. This went on
from time to time until 16th July when I saw both birds commence to build
high up in the clump of wild hops. By 24th July the nest appeared to
be finished. It consisted of an outer layer of fibres, partly bound around
the hops; then a thick layer of fibres interspersed with a number of bamboo
leaves and other dead leaves, and within this a deep cup lined with fibre.
It was about the size of a Blackbird's nest, Turdus merula , but with a
smaller and deeper cup.
On 25th July I saw the cock chasing the hen at terrific speed, calling
loudly and making the peculiar mewing noises. Copulation was not
observed. On 28th July, when I saw the hen leave the nest, I examined
it with the aid of a mirror and could see one egg, rather like that of a
Greenfinch in size and colour.
Both birds shared the incubation, which lasted 14 days, with one young
one hatching on 12th August. The following day another young one
hatched out, and because the hen is not so tame I kept out of the flight
for fear of upsetting her. From then on it was a case of supplying as
much live food as possible. This meant going out into the fields every
day with a large net to catch flies. Luckily the weather during this period

was rather hot, and this made it easier for me since the parents were
able to catch plenty of live food in the flight.
I would have preferred to let the birds come out at liberty to collect food,
but as I have a Siamese cat I thought the idea might be a little imprudent.
On 28th August the two babies came out of the nest, the feather colouring
being the same as that of the adult birds. They roosted apart from each
other and unfortunately the weather became a little chilly. They both
died at two days out of the nest.
The parents appeared to be mating again at about 30th August, but
nothing came of this, and I brought them back into the bird room on
15th October. This year (1973) they have gone into a large planted flight
and I am hoping for better results.

FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON THE

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996834583333333" page_id="56811576"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
Since writing the notes on the Tourmaline Sunangel, Heliangelus
exortis , which appeared in Vol. 79 : 79-83 of this magazine. I have
learnt from personal observation, that the species will in fact roost on
one foot.
For two weeks I purposely entered my birdroom before the birds had
awakened from their night's sleep, and each time I found the Sunangel
using the left foot only to grip the perch. It is surprising the bird uses
the left foot during the night period, because as already mentioned in my
previous notes, the right foot is favoured during the hours of daylight.
Since writing my previous notes, I have also had the opportunity to
examine male H. exortis both in juvenile and post-juvenile plumages.
The juvenile plumage resembles that of an adult female except for the
white patch on the chin and lower throat which in the juvenile male is
smaller and speckled with green. Male's in post-juvenile plumage
resemble the adults but are shining rather than glittering green on the
chest. As with the adult male, the chin and upper throat is violet-blue
and the lower throat is red. However, although these feathers are some-
what iridescent, they are not so brilliant as in the adult bird, nor are they
as pronounced. In the post-juvenile plumage, there is a faint white line
running along the bottom edge of the red of the lower throat. The tail
feathers in the post-juvenile male, although longer than that of the juvenile
bird (and the female), are not so long, nor as deeply forked as in the
adult bird.

In a recent paper in Avicultural Magazine, Willson and von Neumann
(1972) draw attention to the higher proportion of colourful birds in the
tropics than in the temperate zone, but are unable to suggest any general
hypothesis to explain this phenomenon. A reexamination of their data,
however, shows that the problem can be at least clarified by separating
the colourful birds in the tropics into two groups: those which have
developed colourful plumage for the same reasons as temperate species
(and presumably have the same proportion of colourful forms), and those
which have developed bright colours in response to purely tropical
conditions. Birds in the latter category would be expected to belong to
groups absent in the temperate zone, and the addition of such groups to
the fauna would then account for the increase in the proportion of
brightly-plumaged birds in the tropics.
That such a division does occur (as opposed for any general tendency
for birds to be more colourful in the tropics) is indicated by a consideration
of groups with wide latitudinal ranges. The following table, drawn from
the appendix to Willson and von Neumann's paper, compares the propor-
tions of colourful birds in families having representation of io spp. or
more each in temperate North America and in South America.

It is apparent from the above that in most families there is no tendency
for the proportion of brightly coloured birds to increase in the tropics.
The exceptions are the Corvidae, Parulidae and Icteridae. The higher
proportion of colourful corvids in the New World tropics is almost
certainly a reflection of the absence of the genus Corvus in South America.
Parulids also show a decrease in diversity in the tropics. The largest
genus of the family in tropical South America is Basileuterus (n of the

19 species) whose members, although many have yellow underparts or
well-marked crown patches (6 spp. at tropical elevations) and are therefore
colourful by Willson and von Neumann's standards, strike the observer as
much less brilliant than most North American species (data from Meyer
de Schauensee 1970, which excludes Central American species).
The highest proportions of colourful species in the New World tropics,
as listed by Willson and von Neumann, are found in the Psittacidae (100%),
Trogonidae (100%), Momotidae (100%), Galbulidae (100%), Capitonidae

Coerebidae (74%), Bucconidae (67%), Corvidae (64%), Thraupidae
(64%), Trochilidae (63%), Icteridae (63%), Pipridae (51%), and
Cotingidae (28%) (ignoring the Cathartidae). Most of these families have
poor representation or are absent in temperate North America. More
important, they represent ecological types largely confined to the tropics.
Most are obligate or almost obligate frugivores (e.g. Psittacidae, Trog-
onidae, Capitonidae, Ramphastidae, Pipridae, some Cotingidae, Thrau-
pidae, some Icteridae (e.g. Icterus )) or nectarivores (e.g. Trochilidae,
Coerebidae) (Haverschmidt 1968, Thomson 1964). These feeding types
are rare in temperate latitudes, presumably because the stronger seasonality
restricts the availability of fruit and nectar during much of the year.
A similar correlation between diet and plumage holds in the Old World,
where many of the brilliantly coloured species are frugivorous (e.g.
Psittacidae, Musophagidae, Trogonidae, Capitonidae, Paradisaeidae) or
nectarivorous (e.g. Psittacidae (Lories), Dicaeidae, Nectariniidae) (Thom-
son 1964, Gilliard 1969). Contrasted with this is the failure of the large
families of insectivorous birds in the tropics (e.g. the Dendrocolaptidae,
Furnariidae, Formicariidae and Tyrannidae in the New World, and the
Sylviinae and Timaliine complexes in the Old) to produce more than a few
colourful species. As a further indication that frugivory and bright or
striking plumage tend to be correlated, in the Cotingidae and the closely
related Pipridae those genera with bright colours or ornamental plumage
(e.g. Phoenicercus , Cotinga , Xipholena , Iodopleura , Haematoderus , Querula ,
Perissocephalus , Gymnodoera , Procnias, Rupicola , Pipra , Xenopipo ,
Chiroxiphia , Manacus ) are obligate or primarily frugivores, while those
with more dully-coloured plumage (e.g. Attila , Laniocera , Rhytipterna ,
Lipaugus , Pachyramphus , Platypsaris, Tyranneutes , Schiffornis , Neopelma)
are largely insectivorous (Slud 1964, Haverschmidt 1968). Similar cases
exist in the Old World, where the fruit-eating pigeons of the genus
Ptilinopus are the most colourful in the family, and in the Drepaniidae of
the Hawaiian Islands, in which the largely nectarivorous genera Drepanis ,
Ciridops , Palmeria, Vestiaria and Himatione are generally more colourful
than the insectivorous or granivorous genera Loxops , Psittirostra , Pseudo-
nestor and Hemignathus (the exceptions being the black Drepanis funerea
and the red Loxops maculata jlammea and L. c. coccinea respectively).

There are several possible reasons why frugivorous and nectarivorous
birds are likely to be brightly coloured. Firstly, food items for such birds
are more likely to be concentrated in circumscribed areas--i.e. single
fruiting or flowering trees--than is the case for insectivorous or granivorous
species. This tends to bring the birds into close physical proximity during
feeding, and may as a result increase aggressive encounters. Humming-
birds, for instance, are highly aggressive, as are the nectarivorous Drepaniids
in Hawaii. The Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea ), the most brilliantly coloured of
the latter family, is also one of the most pugnacious (personal observation).
Frugivores are apparently less overtly aggressive than nectarivores. The
presence of bright colours in both groups, however, may provide more
striking aggressive signalling patterns and as a result contribute to the
spacing of individuals at feeding sites. Secondly, the utilisation of a food
source, such as fruit or nectar, that can be gathered with a minimum
amount of search may free the male from the necessity of assisting the
female in parental care, and as a result promote the development of
polygamous mating systems in which the male mates with a wide variety
of females instead of forming a pair-bond. In such birds the male
normally develops brilliant colours and/or ornamental plumage for use in
display. The first factor mentioned above may be more important in
those forms in which both sexes are brightly coloured (e.g. Ptilinopus
doves, Psittacidae, Capitonidae, Drepaniidae, many Thraupidae); the
second applies to such groups as Paradisaeidae, Pipridae and Rupicola.
The two factors are not necessarily mutually exclusive; many humming-
birds have polygamous mating systems and are highly aggressive at feeding
sites.
In addition it should be pointed out that many of the birds considered
are birds of edge and forest canopy (presumably as a result of the dis-
tribution of their food sources), and that bright colouration may render
birds most inconspicuous against the brilliant greens of tropical rainforest
foliage. Again, this is not a contradiction of the above-stated explanations;
a bird which might be inconspicuous to an aerial predator, viewing it from
above, may be quite the opposite to a conspecific at its own level in the
canopy. As an example, in many of the Ptilinopus doves the back is
bright green while the head and underside carry distinctive markings in
other colours. Thus these birds would present a completely different
aspect when viewed from below or on the same level--as a conspecific
might see them--than they would viewed from above against a green
background.
The evidence, as reviewed above, is thus against any general tendency
for birds to be more colourful in the tropics than in temperate latitudes.
It seems probable that the primary reason for the larger number of
colourful birds in the tropics is the addition to the avifauna of nectar-
and fruit-eating groups not found in the temperate zone. Admittedly
other special factors may be present in the tropics; for instance, the

Momotidae, Galbulidae and Bucconidae are not frugivorous but do
represent feeding types absent in higher latitudes. Probably there are a
wide variety of reasons for the evolution of bright plumage, but for many
groups the explanations will be equally applicable in the temperate zone.

NESTING OF THE KEA, NESTOR NOTABILIS,
AT JERSEY ZOO

By Margaret Mallet (Bird Section, Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust)
The Kea, Nestor notabilis is found in the South Island mountain areas
of New Zealand, with a more extensive range than in the latter half of the
last century, in spite of the massive toll taken by sheep farmers. They
nest on the edge of the high level forests and obtain food from the forests
clothing the mountain valleys, ranging widely to the alpine grasslands for
Autumn fruits. During wintertime their natural curiosity and lack of
food brings them further down the mountains to human habitation levels,
where they tend to annoy the local population by their destructive habits,
which include pulling tiles off roofs, chewing window frames and even
entering houses and helping themselves to objects which take their fancy.
This provides entertainment for the tourists, but they too can suffer
the disadvantages of these birds' curiosity and boldness, since they are
not averse to hopping into cars and creating the same sort of havoc that
they do in houses.
In May 1963, a pair of keas was presented to the Jersey Zoo by the
New Zealand government and a second female arrived the following
August. All three were housed in an aviary, the dimensions of which are
approximately 30 ft. x 12 ft. x 9 ft. high with a shelter provided at the

rear, under which are two large barrels, about four feet from the ground;
the birds use these to sleep on but very seldom go inside them. In the
centre of the aviary is a large mound of granite rocks and logs and
wedged amongst these is a metal container for bathing and drinking.
Ample perching is provided and fresh branches are given daily--Willow
being the most acceptable. The area under the shelter is sanded and the
remainder of the aviary is grass.
Their diet consists of sunflower seeds, peanuts, omniverous nuts,
hardboiled egg (of which only the yolk is eaten) and any fruits and vegetables
in season. Added to this are the staple, oranges, apples, bananas, plus
dates, fresh coconut, figs, melon, chicory and lettuce. They also eat
kidney, but are more enthusiastic about it during the breeding season,
and brown bread soaked in a nectar mixture is always the first item to be
eaten. Their lettuce is usually taken straight to their water container and
" dunked " several times before it is consumed, but I have not seen them
give the same treatment to any other item of food except for their carrot.
The young keas on the other hand, spent a great deal of time around their
water bowl and a large amount of their food was to be found at the bottom
of it each morning.
In December 1965, a wooden " T " shaped nest-box was installed, but
although it was thoroughly inspected at the time, no great interest was
shown in it until the beginning of January 1966, when the male and female
began spending a large part of their time in it. The second female was
always driven away if she attempted to enter, and if she succeeded, was
promptly chased out again after a brief bout of squabbling, but once clear
of the tunnel entrance, was left to her own devices and at no time was she
bullied by them. Eventually, she was seen to spend most of her time at
the front of the aviary although they all fed from the same dish. However,
by the end of February, it was obvious that no serious attempt at nesting
was to be made that year, and by the end of the month all three were
amicable again.
In the years 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, four, five, four,
seven, seven and seven eggs were laid respectively, the majority of which
were fertile. Several of these disappeared during the latter part of in-
cubation and we had strong reason to suspect that the male was responsible
for this, since whenever he went to feed the female, a good deal of squab-
bling was heard before she chased him out of the box, although he was
never actually seen to take an egg. In order to cut down the losses as much
as possible, each egg was removed as it was laid and replaced with one from
a bantam and put back a few days before they were due to hatch. Some
chicks were hatched during these years, but none survived for more than
48 hours, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to hand-rear one in 1970.
The second female did not appear to be a disturbing influence on the
pair during the breeding season, but nevertheless, it was decided to remove
her to a small cage some distance away, and to make another one for the

male kea which was built at the back of their aviary. So at the beginning
of the 1972 season, the odd female was taken out, and when the clutch of
seven eggs was completed, the male was shut into his quarters where he
could still have contact with the female and eventually the young.
Unfortunately, during the time the pair were together, to ensure fertili-
sation one egg disappeared and one was found damaged at the entrance of
the nesting area, leaving a clutch of five.
An interesting point is that a kea clutch in all accounts, only consists
of four eggs, maximum, yet on three occasions our female has laid seven
eggs and once five. On several occasions she has laid one or two eggs
and then stopped for a period of about a week before starting again and
laying every two or three days. This has inevitably meant a long gap
between the laying of the first and last eggs, another reason for taking
them away and putting them back once she has started to sit. Therefore,
the first eggs were sometimes placed under pigeons and it was a chick
from one of these fostered eggs that we attempted to hand-rear.
In 1972, incubation commenced on the 16th February and on the nth
March, the first chick had hatched, Nos. two, three and four hatching on
the 12th and 14th. The fifth chick was unfortunately dead in shell. On
hatching, the chicks are covered in white down, with large sack-like
structures at outer edges of their beaks, giving them a rather grotesque
appearance.
Beaks, legs and areas of skin around the eyes are pale pink for the
first few days, gradually changing to a greyish green, and eventually
turning to a clear yellow at the age of about eight weeks, except for the
beaks and legs which turned black. This colour is retained for at least
two years, and probably until they approach maturity at four to five years.
The chicks were checked daily and at all times had full crops and
stomachs, the first food to be seen in their crops being carrot. Our Keas
and also those at Zurich, are very partial to chicory and during the rearing
of their chicks were given three a day. It is customary for the male kea
to feed the female while she has young, but since our male could not do
this by going to the nest box, he used to feed her through the wire of his
cage, whereupon, she would go straight back and feed the chicks. Three
feeds a day were given at this period, one of which was placed in the
tunnel to the nesting area.
On 17th March one dead chick was found in the tunnel and we had a
few anxious days wondering if they were suffering from some contagious
disease, but the remaining young continued to grow rapidly and on the
5th April, the first pin featheres could be seen along the edges of their
wings. By the second week in May they were fully feathered and although
they would venture along the tunnel, they were not seen in the aviary
until the 26th May, but since they seemed very timid it is probable they
had been out at night-time before that date; once they realised they were
being observed, they would dash back to the safety of their nest-box.

As they became more confident and spent longer periods outside, it was
easier to note their behaviour and they and their father appeared to take
great interest in each other, but he was not seen to feed them until several
weeks later.
The male kea was released from his cage on 15th June and rapidly
settled into family life, although for the first three days he was put into
his quarters at night. No antagonism was observed from him towards
the young ones, but neither did he appear to take any great interest in
them; it is possible that the female could have been partly responsible for
this since she was the dominant party at this period and would not tolerate
him anywhere near her, and it was with her that the young spent a great
amount of their time.
The timidity they displayed at their debut, rapidly diminished, and
by the beginning of July, one in particular had become most confident
and friendly; this specimen was heavier in build than the other two, with a
longer curved beak and his sex was tentatively determined as a male. He
readily took food and play objects from my hand, and took great delight in
dropping my rubber gloves in the water container until, at the risk of
offending him I decided to terminate this practice, but he still derived
great pleasure from trying to pull them off my hands. He also enjoyed
playing with my clothes, tugging at a leather belt, boots and most of all
emptying the rubbish bucket by tossing everything out with his beak.
The other two would watch these activities with great interest, occasionally
attempting to wrest a plaything from him, but since he was the dominant
one, they usually had to wait until he lost interest in it, and even the
objects they took from my hand, he quickly commandeered. Robert
Keller observed the behaviour of this group of Keas during the latter
part of June, and it is due to him, I am sure, that the young keas and I
derived so much pleasure from each other's company, since he advised
that spending as much time with them as possible could be nothing but
advantageous to all of us.
On the 25th October one pair of the young keas was sent to Paignton
Zoo, and later the single female to Chief Officer of the Parks Department,
London.
In the current year (1973) they are again nesting sucessfully, with three
young hatched. This time the male has been permitted to remain with
the chicks since hatching and his behaviour has been exemplary. We
believe this is due to a second nest-box having been installed and his
having somewhere to go during incubation apart from the nesting area.

At Slimbridge, the Wildfowl Trust has its major collection of waterfowl,
screamers and flamingos. This concourse of birds is the largest and
most comprehensive collection of one group of animals in the world and
its has been my privilege, over the last twenty-six years to collect them
together and to create their environment.
I came to Slimbridge with a medical training and a knowledge of
architecture and building construction. My acquaintance with waterfowl
was to say the least, limited. But I was fortunate in having as my boss,
Sir Peter Scott, whose enthuiastic support and encouragement has made
the project so worth-while. Furthermore I was lucky in the early days
to be under the tutelage of that great and unassuming aviculturist, John
Yealland.
Apart from the passerines in the Tropical House, there have been over
this period 197 forms represented of which 163 produced eggs and 152
kinds have been reared. It is difficult to be sure of first records, but it is
believed that 14 of these were reared for the first time in captivity and
27 in Britain. One of the attractions of New Grounds is the wintering
flocks of wild swans, geese and ducks and ample facilities are given to our
members for viewing these birds at close quarters, and without too much
difficulty. There are six towers of varying heights, some fitted with
powerful binoculars, numerous hides, and a very comfortable observation
room, adjoining the hostel, where one can view the winter population of
Bewick's Swans, together with numerous Pintail, Wigeon and Shoveler.
For many years the collection was kept in an area of some thirty-five
acres and this posed particular problems regarding the segregation of the
more aggressive species and finding fresh grazing annually for rearing
the young birds. However, in 1972, we were able to expand and the
new development has made it possible to fox-proof 100 acres. It was
intended that the extension should include a Nene park, swan pens,
Mallard aviaries, and further heated quarters. There would also be
additional grazing for flocks of fifty or more geese of individual species.
An eleven acre field has also been fenced close to the propagation centre
for rearing purposes. An additional water supply was planned to be
supplied by means of Well Points.
For the collection the amenities are many. There are four series
of aviaries and perhaps the most interesting are those adjoining the
propagation building, which are built on the principle of the tent pole.
Steel hawsers, tensioned by means of bottle screws, rise upwards and
forwards from the seven-foot-high shelter to a point fifteen feet above the
observation path and held in position by steel scaffolding poles. This
structure is covered with half-inch wire netting and provides a flight space

some twenty feet long. Each partition has a pond with flowing water
and a winter-house with infra-red heat and a tapped water supply.
The Guinness Aviary is eighty yards long and is constructed of semi-
circular frames of tubular steel with a radius of twelve feet. Each section
has an external pond with flowing water and a heated house with separate
water supply. This structure was presented to the Trust some fifteen
years ago by the famous Dublin Brewery. Since that time among the
rarer birds to breed therein were Spotted Whistling Duck, New Zealand
Brown Duck, Hartlaub's Duck and White-winged Wood Duck.
The other two rows of aviaries are of the conventional type with flat
roofs and wooden frames. Both have external and internal water-ways
with flowing water and infra-red heat. They are used principally for
rearing full-winged birds and for wintering the more delicate birds in the
collection.
The Propagation Centre has recently been rebuilt through the generosity
on an anonymous benefactor. The building contains food silos, rooms
for milling food, food preparation, insect propagation, incubation, surgery
and X-ray. There is on the first floor a large work shop and store room
together with a staff recreation room. Half the ground floor is devoted
to an indoor rearing unit. Here there are some forty raised pens, each
virtually one yard square with plastic and wire-netting floors and roofs.
The partitions are removable and are wooden. The pens can therefore be
altered in size to suit the number and size of the young birds. Each is
supplied with an infra-red lamp adjustable for height, and a plastic mat
the latter being from the hygenic point of view far more easy to clean
than sacking. The floor of the unit is in rendered cement and is washed
down daily. Originally intended for the more delicate species without foster
mothers, it has been found that the installation is extremely useful for all
species, particularly when weather conditions are bad.
In the early days, in fact for the first seven or eight years, there was no
electricity at New Grounds and the natural flow of water was very, very
slow. At this time the young were reared on an ' S ' bend of water
leading into the top pond of the Rushy Pen. However, with the arrival
of power, I constructed a prototype duckery with a water course where the
water flowed over a step from pen to pen. There were three rows of
pens, but the last pen in each row had water from all the others in the row.
This was hardly the basis of good hygiene. In consequence a further
duckery was built. Here water, pumped up from water bearing sand
20 ft. below the surface, is fed into a raised header channel to three rows
of pens. From the header channels water is fed into a shallow, wide,
cement-lined ditch to each of the pens. In one row the ditch is widened
out to deeper ponds for the diving ducklings. The water leaves the pens
by means of waste drain, whence it flows into a disused rhine. The pens
are some 150 sq. ft. in area and at the height of the breeding season can
be sub-divided to accommodate the thousand young birds that are reared

annually. The water supply to each pen is controlled by a wooden tank
and the 3500 gallons per hour supply is found to be adequate for this
purpose. There is a power supply available to each pen. Weather
conditions permitting and provided the downies are feeding satisfactorily,
they are moved from the internal to the external duckery about the fifth
day where they are installed in one of the rather sophisticated brooders
that I first built some fifteen years ago and which have been gradually
modified as experience with their use has proved necessary. The
alterations have been principally in the reduction of length from six to
four ft. and in making the handles detachable for the purposes of easier
handling and storage. Swans, geese and ducks, with or without a bantam,
are reared with equal facility in this type of brooder.

Other facilities for the captive birds include a recently constructed
sea-duck pool. This consists of three ponds at different levels and
connected by rocky cascades. The highest is at eye-level, the middle at
waist, and the lowest at ground-level. The middle pond is retained by a
Cotswold stone wall and here visitors can approach close to the birds,
which are fed on stone shelves projecting from the interior of the wall at
water-level. The water supply is pumped into the top pond by means of a
well-point system. It was hoped that the cold fresh water pumped up
from below ground would also be clear, but unfortunately due to the high
iron content it is translucent rather than transparent and in consequence
the proposed underwater window has not been installed.
The Tropical House was another project sponsored by a generous
benefactor. It has a floor space of 2700 sq. ft. and a maximum height of
15 ft. At least two thirds of the floor space is water. There are three
ponds connected by waterfalls, one relatively large with the surface five ft.
above the ground. It is fed by a waterfall from almost roof height.
Water circulates from here through the two ft. high centre pond into one
at ground-level. Thence it is pumped back again over the top waterfall.
Originally filled from the mains the water is circulated twenty-four hours
of the day. The walls, a cavity structure with an internal skin of Therma-
lite blocks and a double roof of transparent plastic were erected through
the kindness of two members of the Trust. The Royal Botanical Gardens,
Kew, supplied the plants and advised on planting. All the internal
construction, rock-work, ponds etc. were carried out by the staff. The
building is kept in winter at a temperature between 65 and 7o*F by means
of Wanson Thermopiles, hot air heaters, in duplicate (in case of failure).
A Lister generator cuts in automatically in case of power failure. There is a
sprinkler system to simulate tropical rain and a lighting system to increase
the hours of light during winter months.
The ' raison d&amp;apos;etre &amp;apos; for the tropical House was the hope of breeding
the Pigmy geese. Unfortunately, up to the time of my retirement, the
only waterfowl to breed there were the Hottentot Teal. But having
produced suitable conditions, it was decided to try our hand with some
passerines. And Hummingbirds, Tanagers, Pittas, Sun Bitterns and
Roulrouls were tried.
The Brown-breasted Hummingbird ( Amazillia castaneiventris) laid on
several occasions, but the eggs were infertile and it was never certain
whether the birds were a pair. The Brown Violet-eared ( Colibri
delphinae) nested and reared a chick paired to a male Sparkling Violet-
eared ( Colibri thalassinus). The Golden Tanger ( Tangara arthus) and

the Blue-necked ( Tangara cyanicollis ) both reared young as did the
Blue-winged Pitta ( Pitta moluccensis).
Giant toads and Geckos were introduced with a view to controlling a
cockroach infestation but with little success. The fish in the ponds
include Silver and Grass Carp, Swordtails and Guppys.

S. T. JOHNSTONE--NOTES FROM SLIMBRIDGE
Apart from the conservation story of the Hawaiian Geese, which must
by now be well known in avicultural circles, the Trust has embarked on
a similar project with the White-winged Wood Duck (Cairina scutulata )
regarded as a much endangered species. There were at Slimbridge
several pairs of these birds some fifteen years ago and they lived for
several years but never showed signs of breeding.
In 1970, with the aid of the World Wildlife Fund, two consignments
of birds were caught in Assam and sent to Slimbridge. These were
paired and put into the larger sections of the aviaries; some pinioned and
some left full-winged. Nesting-sites in the form of kennels and open-
topped boxes were placed 10 ft. high, 2 ft. high and on the ground,
4 alternatives being offered to each pair, though the highest site was
omitted in the case of the pinioned birds. In each case a kennel was placed
on a log in the winter shelter. Of the 3 clutches laid in 1971 and 1972
two were by a full-winged pair and one by a pinioned pair. The latter
and one of the former were in the kennel in the winter quarters. The
other of the flighted pair was high up in a willow. The clutches were
large, 12 to 14, and the eggs similar in size and shape to that of the Muscovy
Duck though they were somewhat darker in colour. The incubation
period would seem to be between 32 and 34 days. I issued an edict that
the birds were not to be disturbed and the nest not examined until the
parent appeared on her pond with the brood. Incubation period and
clutch number could wait until the birds were more firmly established.
The hatches were successful and in due course the broods appeared on
their ponds. It was found that the males spent their time ' dunking '
the ducklings and to prevent any drowning they were removed to a
separate aviary and not returned to their females until the young were
fully feathered and had left their mother. Some twenty birds have been
reared in the last two seasons. The downies were patterned and coloured
like young Mallard, being brown and yellow, a characteristic feature was
noted in the way the post orbital stripe turned up at an angle to join the
dark cap. Like all cairinini the tarsus was duo-coloured in this case brown
and yellow. The juvenile plumage was dark brown where the adult was
black.

I know that most sincere aviculturists, in spite of what many con-
servationists say, are really very concerned about the state of wild
populations. People keep birds privately because they love them, not
because they want to exploit them.
Of course, there are the exceptions--every trade, profession and calling
has its black sheep--but notwithstanding this, I feel certain that what
shocks me as a conservationist and aviculturist will also shock 90% of my
fellow enthusiasts, or at least I sincerely hope it will. A friend of mine,
H. Elliott McClure, who is ornithologist with the American Migratory
Animal Pathological Survey in Thailand (which is a branch of the U.S.
Forces, and works in conjunction with the Applied Scientific Research
Corporation of Thailand) has just sent me a report published by the
Thai Goverment.
It is entitled Animal Exportation From Thailand In 1962-71 , it runs to
22 pages and deals with mammals, birds and reptiles. It is, to my mind,
both an important and horrifying publication which demands to be read
by all who love Oriental wildlife. It does not set out specifically to shock,
in fact, if anything, an opposite inference comes through. The opening
words of the Introduction read as follows:
Wild animals make up one of the natural resources of the country which
are of value to the economy, education and recreation of the people.
In the past, Thailand has received millions of Baht income from the
exportation of wild animals alone. Many species are in demand and
therefore commercial business dealing with wild animals seems to be
a real promising one. This has also been beneficial to the circulation
of Thai currency within the country.
What follows is true; it is happening now. And in writing this, I
sincerely hope that it is not taken for a personal attack on aviculture or
aviculturists because it is certainly not intended as such. I merely feel
that readers of this journal have a right to know what is going on, and will
find the following stimulating and form their own opinions as I have done.
The faults lie within the "system": the fact that Thailand is a poor
country; the fact that it is (or was) very rich in exotic wildlife; the fact
that it is inhabited by Orientals; and, let us be truthful, the fact that world
demand (essentially European and American) for tropical animals has
proliferated out of all proportion in recent years.
It should be borne in mind that the report is only concerned with those
animals which left the country legally via the Don Muang Airport. I
emphasise that it does not include animals which have been brought
out illegally, and as the report points out: " This [higher priced] group
has often been smuggled out for profit

In 1967 the Royal Forestry Department set up a Wild Animal Inspection
Office at the airport, and so data since then has been much more detailed.
For the earlier period (1962-6), data was gathered from the records of the
Department of Foreign Trade, and is so peripheral that we can almost
ignore it. Perhaps the most interesting facts to emerge for that period
with regard to birds are that 549 Roulroul Partridges (Rollulus roulroul)
were exported with the peak being 192 in 1963; 336 Great Argus Pheasants
(Argusianus argus) were exported, the peak being 126 in 1964, since
protection in 1966 their export has been banned. Of the other pheasants,
424 were exported; so were 437 hornbills--of which over half were
members of the Great Hornbill species (Buceros bicornis).
These figures do little to prepare one for what is in store, for no mention
is made of the more popular species. Incidentally, in the same period,
as many as 45,799 monkeys (Macaco, spp.) were likewise dispatched.
In the table I have listed each species or group of which more than
100 were exported in the five years from 1967-71 together with a few
especially interesting types of less than that number.

It is clear which species suffer the heaviest predation from human
trappers. The case of the Pin-tailed Parrot Finch (Nonpareil) aptly
spotlights the overall picture: from a large enough figure of 18,000 in
1967, this all but doubled each year until 1971--when a phenomenal

number of nearly 196,000 or 538 every single day were exported, making
a grand total of over 417,000 for the five years at an average of 83,446 every
year. This species suffers most it would seem; another hard-pressed bird
is, perhaps predictably, the popular so-called Talking Mynah---of which
on average over 40,000 are exported each year, with a record number of
nearly 62,000 in 1971.
There are no figures available yet for 1972, but I see no reason to
believe why this figure should not jump up again. The case of the Mynah
is particularly sad as few are ever bred in captivity--over 99% of the
200,334 exported from Thailand over the last five years are sure to be
living unproductive solitary lives.
Parrots of the Psittacula genus (these include the Alexandrine Parakeet
(P. eupatria ), Blossom-headed Parakeet (P. cyanocephala rosa ) and the
Grey-headed Parakeet (P. himalayana finschii)) have also been subjected
to increased export trafficking: from little over 1,500 in 1967, the figure
has rocketed to one approaching 80,000 for the year 1971 (which is
nearly 20,000 more than the sum of the preceding four years).
Munias, even excluding the Chestnut Munia, have been exported over
the period at an evarage of nearly 22,000 p.a., with well over half (56,259)
the sum total (108,619) being handled in 1971. The Chestnut Munia
almost equals that figure on its own with on average a steady 19 J thousand
leaving Thailand each year.
Other figures which struck me as being particularly disturbing were
those for the Scarlet-backed Flowerpecker and birds of prey---of which
numbers in excess of 13,500 and 3,000 respectively were exported in 1971.
The numbers of owls to leave Thailand increased from a mere twenty-one
in 1967 to 1,368 in 1971. 15,685 doves and pigeons were exported in the
period, together with no mean totals of 782 kingfishers, 1,326 hornbills,
1,819 woodpeckers, 1,750 barbets, 1,756 pittas and no fewer than 6,368
Fairy Bluebirds were similarly sent out.
Apart from the birds I have listed in the table, the report also covers
many other species--which appear to be less prone to exploitation and are
exported in more reasonable numbers. By and large the current progress
of this " boom business " is easily deduced from the 1969-71 figures.
Over those three years, an average of 210,248 birds were exported legally
from the Don Muang Airport each year.
Figures such as these must concern even the most hardened aviculturist.
Clearly we have a lot of work to do if aviculture (the foreign-bird branch)
is to remain a respectable occupation. It is my personal opinion that
there has got to be changes, and many foreign-bird enthusiasts are going
to have to try a lot harder to breed their own stock replacements--for
that is surely our responsibility. We cannot continue to be consumers
of nature in this wholesale manner. Aviculture, for its own good, must
change with the times: already, and many would say not before time,
Thailand along with many other tropical countries is tightening the screws
on her wildlife drain.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF
PAINTED QUAIL
Excalfactoria chinensis
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.955653862068966" page_id="56811596"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
About a year ago I had the opportunity to keep Painted Quail,
Excalfactoria chinensis , again and to make further observations on their
behaviour at close quarters. These have added a few interesting facts to
those already recorded (Harrison 1965, 1968; Harrison, Restall and
Trollope 1968).
A pair of quail was given to me for observation by Mr. J. Dowling.
The female had developed an odd affliction which caused her constantly
to fall over. I lacked accommodation for birds at the time and therefore
kept the quail in the room where I was working, converting a shallow
cardboard box about 3 ft. X 2 ft. X 1 ft. high by covering the open top with
gauze panels and inserting a long glass panel into the side of the box.
This makeshift cage rested on a bench just below a large window.
The female's trouble appeared to be due to some injury which had
impaired her sense of balance so that whenever she turned her head to
the left or looked around sharply, she fell backwards. Apart from this
she appeared normal. In an attempt to help, and to watch her progress,
I made an imitation thicket with thin, upright strips of stiff card projecting
an inch or two apart from a solid base. With these to support her when
she staggered, the female moved around with reasonable agility. Unfortu-
nately she succeeded in wedging herself in the water-pot during a fall,
and in my absence drowned herself. The male commenced the usual
calling that occurs in isolation or when the female is not visible; and as
soon as possible I provided him with another mate.
The Crouching Walk
Although I had not seen evidence of a furtive way of walking in these
or other Painted Quail in indoor situations or when they were on the floor
of a shed, the relatively shallow and open-topped box near a large window
apparently created an artificial " open space " situation. The birds, when
</bodyText>

C. J. O. HARRISON--NOTES ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF PAINTED QUAIL 1 37
moving across the box, would use a crouching posture appropriate to such
a situation. The birds moved slowly, with the legs flexed so that the
body feathers were almost touching the ground. The body was
horizontal and the head held low, the top of it in line with the back.
The movement was smooth, lacking the more jerky, head-nodding motion
of the normal walk. This smooth movement is the one referred to prev-
iously (Harrison 1965) which, seen from above, gives the impression
that the bird is gliding along on wheels rather than legs. When almost
to the further side of the box the bird would abandon this slow movement
for a sudden rush to the " cover " of the wall.
A bird suddenly introduced into a box or bare space of this kind may
show a similar stance, but half-squatting, with the legs flexed, but the
body more upright and the head raised. In this posture it may move
around in abrupt, short rushes and, until it relaxes, gives the impression
that it has sustained some kind of injury.
Alarm Call?
In addition to this fear of open space the quail also showed constant
nervous awareness of the passage of larger birds, such as rooks and jack-
daws, outside the window. The rapid ticking or reeling call which I had
previously suspected to be an avian predator alarm was sometimes heard
in such circumstances. This call, which was usually followed by a short
period of complete silence and motionlessness, also occurred occasionally
in response to some external sound, such as the sudden shrieking alarm of
a blackbird outside the building, although no cause for fear was visible.
However, on one or two occasions a sudden bout of this reeling was followed
by the male dashing in circles round the female with plumage fluffed and
wings drooping in display, suggesting that the call may have a broader
function than is at first apparent.

Roosting

<bodyText confidence="0.999823384615385" page_id="56811597"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
In order to give the birds a greater sense of security I added a number
of grass tufts at one end of the box. The most immediately noticeable
effect was on their roosting behaviour. The pair roost side by side with
the hinder ends of their bodies pressed together so that the head ends
diverge slightly, or side by side facing in opposite directions, sometimes
pressed together so tightly that they appear like one ball of feathers.
Hitherto they had normally roosted towards one corner of the box but in
the open. When the added turves provided cover in this area they used
the cover almost continuously during the day, but at night they moved to
the bare half of the box where they still roosted in the open space.
The Throat Pattern as a Signal
The grass tufts, with earth still on the roots, had been arranged so that
they provided a fairly level roof of drooping blades about 5 ins. above the

ground and left small tunnels between the bases of the tufts. The birds
quickly utilised these and after thorough exploration both birds, but
particularly the female, spent much of the time squatting in small hollows
which also gave a wide view of the box. When the birds were using the
grass tuft area one aspect of the plumage became more apparent. The
throat of the female is unpatterned and pale, but the male has a bold
black and white pattern restricted to the throat and lores. When the
birds were creeping through the grass tunnels they would raise their heads
at intervals, pushing them up through the grass-blades and looking around.
In this posture the bill was tilted upwards and what showed most con-
spicuously above the grass was the throat area which, when the remainder
of the bird was concealed, provided as immediate signal indicating both
the species and sex of the bird. It may be that the bold pattern restricted
to the face and throat is related in this species and perhaps in other
gamebirds, to this aspect of visibility in a grassland habitat.
Nest-Calling
The second female I put with the male was a young one beginning a
moult and it was a month or two before she showed any tendency to nest.
During the greater part of this period the male performing intermittent
bouts of nest-calling (or " cornering " as it is sometimes called in behaviour
studies). In performing nest-calling the male would squat in a corner or
hollow, facing outwards, with the breast lowered and the tail end sometimes
raised in the air. Various scraping and scuffling sounds could be heard
but it was not possible to see what foot-movements occurred.
This posture was accompanied by a low-pitched, subdued and mournful
note constantly repeated. It sometimes appeared to be a monosyllabic
" quoor, quoor, quoor " repeated an indefinite number of times, but on
other occasions was a disyllabic " quoror, quoror, quoror ". Since the
birds were with me in a rather small room every sound was audible, but a
week or two elapsed before I realised that a series of sounds which occurred
while the male was uttering the mournful note did not, in fact, emanate
from the female but were made by the male concurrent with the other call.
This second series of notes was a subdued twittering, much higher in
pitch than the long-drawn plaintive notes and slightly harsh in tone.
It appeared wholly independent on the other call but careful listening
revealed that there was at times a similar cadence in the two. There are
records of several sounds being uttered simultaneously during song in a
number of bird species, but this performance by the Painted Quail would
seem to be exceptional even in this context.
The female took little or no notice of the male's behaviour, but once
when she walked towards him while he was calling, and several times when
she appeared to come on him suddenly by accident, I saw him flatten him-
self on the ground, half-spreading his wings and turning his head sideways
towards the female so that the throat pattern was visible from above

accompanying this by a soft, rapidly-repeated " wit-wit-wit-wit " call.
This posture was described before (Harrison 1965) as an apparently more
extreme form of tidbitting.
Nest Building
When the grass tufts had been put into the box the male usually called
from a hollow among them, although he sometimes chose a useless site
such as the narrow crown of a tuft where any egg would immediately have
rolled away. Before the grass had been put in he used corners of the box,
or the very slight overhang when the loose paper forming the floor of the
box lay up against the side and drooped over at its upper edge creating a
hollow with slight shelter above.
After a bout of calling the male would often stand on the site stretching
upright and looking upwards, or pecking at the side wall, as though he expected
to find something there. This first occurred during late winter when long
grass was not available and so I took a strip of paper 7-8 inches wide and
cut it deeply along one edge to produce a tall fringe of upstanding, grass
blade-like strips. When I placed this on edge and partly surrounding one
of his sites with it, he called there and then began reaching up and grasping
these false grassblades at or near the tip, pulling them down towards him
and then releasing them. Very shortly a number were drooping inwards
over the site and it is obvious that in a wild state this behaviour would
result in growing herbage arching over the nest-site and concealing it from
above.
Little other evidence of nest-building was seen until the female laid her
first egg when, about an hour before the event, she squatted in a hollow in
the grass and began frenziedly sideways-throwing, seizing small pieces of
grass or debris and with a quick sideways flick of the head throwing them
back to one side of her or the other. She did not lay consistently, and
the male started eating the eggs, destroying them within minutes of their
being laid. On the few occasions that I was able to make observations eggs
were laid between 15.30 and 16.00 hrs.
Care of Young by Male
The behaviour of this male spoilt any hopes of observing a full nesting
cycle, but in recent observation on adults with small chicks, belonging to
other aviculturists, I was interested to observe that the attention which
the male devotes towards the female and brood includes the brooding of
the young chicks, with plumage fluffed in similar fashion to the female's.

(Ketupa zeylonensis)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts., England)
At the London Zoo at dusk on 16th June 1973 I was able to observe
the calling behaviour of an apparent pair of Brown Fish-Owls, Ketupa
zeylonensis. The two birds were perched side by side, facing me; and
when first observed the presumed male had partly turned towards the other
bird. The feathers of its throat were puffed out and formed a large
rounded white mass immediately below the bill, the tips of the ruffled
feathers projecting a little further than the bill. Normally this white
area shows as a thin, inconspicous whitish band across the throat, streaked
with darker colour.
In addition to inflating the throat the bird had also brought the " ear-
tufts " into display. In this species these elongated tufts of feathers
normally lie flat over the eyes, the tips projecting laterally. They had
not been raised like those of other owl species, but appeared to have
been ruffled and brought forwards so that they formed prominent shaggy
brows projecting above the eyes.
In this posture the bird uttered a very deep and surprisingly soft
" hu-hu ", the first syllable a little more emphatic than the second.
The presumed female immediately responded by inflating her throat,
a large white patch appearing where none had been apparent previously,
and uttered a trisyllabic call " hu-hu-hu ", with the first note also slightly
stressed and the other two following at shorter intervals than in the call
of the first bird. When the call was complete the throat deflated and the
white patch disappeared; but the other bird retained the inflated throat
when silent.
The calling was repeated a number of times with the same ceremony.
The two calls followed each other in such a consistent succession that to
anyone not witnessing the performence it might have sounded like a
five-note call from a single bird. The most striking feature was the
quietness of the call-notes. From references in literature it would appear
that they carry well, but heard at close quarters it seemed improbable that
they would carry further than some 50 metres.
The species shows similarities to the typical Eagle Owls. A white
throat patch, inflated when calling, is also present in owls of the genus
Bubo; and Philip Wayre ( pers. comm.) has noted sexual dimorphism in the
call-notes of the Great Eagle Owl, Bubo bubo , the male having a mono-
syllabic call and that of the female being disyllabic.
References in literature to the call of the Brown Fish-Owl vary.
Whistler (1941) refers to " a deep triple hu-who-hu ". Salim Ali and
Ripley (1969) seem aware of both calls, describing " a deep hollow-sounding

Owls are not easy birds to observe in the wild and it is probably only
under aviary conditions that some problems of their vocabulary will be
elucidated.

We have received from Professor Cade at Cornell University the report
of the captive breeding programme on birds of prey, together with some
ancillary literature. Considerable effort has been directed to experiments
in artificial insemination, using captive birds with psychological fixation
on their owners, and there has been some success. In 1972, using artificial
incubation and then allowing adult to rear young, or hand-rearing young,
one Golden Eagle, four Lanner Falcons and one Harris's Hawk were
raised, the eagle being the result of artificial insemination. This is,
however, from sixty-six eggs, twelve of which hatched. The publications
are being placed in the Society's library at the Linnean Society.

According to The New Scientist , Professor Jewell of London University
put forward at a recent meeting the theory that the key feature of domestic
animals (presumably including domestic birds) is that they have lost the
ability to respond to adverse conditions that would suppress breeding in
the wild progenitors. Selection under domestic conditions will have
favoured those individuals which will breed in spite of everything.
While this may seem satisfactory to the average aviculturist it could have
interesting implications for those who claim that we can maintain and
increase wild populations by captive breeding, followed by release of
surplus birds.

Peter Olney writes . . . " the Blue-backed Manakins at the London Zoo
which reared a young male in 1972, reported in the magazine earlier this
year, have unfortunately not repeated their success this year. One egg
was laid in late April on the bare top of the heating pipe grill and, not
surprisingly, was later found to be cooked. Then, in the middle of June,
two partially-fledged young were picked up dead at the back of the
Tropical House. Obviously they had left the nest too early, as did the
original first youngster reared in 1972. Regretably it was not known
that the female was sitting, for no nest was, or has been, found and she
was always on view when we were in the house.
It may be of some interest to record that a hybrid was produced, to an
embryo stage, by a female Active (Black-billed Jamaican) Parrot, Amazona
agilis , and a male White-browed (Spectacled) Parrot, A. albifrons albifrons.
Unfortunately the egg was abandoned after 14 days."

With the six adults he now has Len Hill has succeeded in breeding
more than fourteen Mountain-witch Doves. This rare Jamaican species
is one of the more beautiful of the doves and it is to be hoped that through
Mr. Hill's efforts it may now become more widely established in aviaries
and zoos.

Comments have been made in the past concerning unlikely species
found with the Society's waterfowl rings on them. The latest is a kestrel,
found by someone in north-east London with ring number 714.

During discussion of the effect of light on bird breeding cycles at a
recent conference an attempt was made to relate this to the aviculturists'
problem of migratory native species that may come into breeding condition
too early if given too much light during winter. Dr. R. Murton's advice
was that if the daylight in the bird's wintering area is unknown it is best
to play safe and stick to a less than 12 hour day in winter. Since experi-
ments show that a brief period of illumination during the hours of darkness
each night can have a similar effect to a long day in stimulating a bird's
breeding responses it seems inadvisable even to switch the lights on once
the birds have gone to roost.

Peter Brown writes from the Harewood Bird Garden . . . " Our most
interesting breeding to date this year has been that of four Ypecaha
Wood Rail which are now half grown and scampering all over their aviary
with their parents. This is one of the tallest of the Rails, standing
18 in.-2 ft. and not at all secretive like most Rails. They are eating
mostly live food and a little beef.
Ringnecks and imported Redrumps have young as do Peach-faced and
Fischer's Lovebirds. Penguins were again a disaster with six hatched but
none reared. The oldest lived for two weeks on hand-rearing but then
died. We have tried a variety of food substances, but we cannot come up
with the complete answer. Invariably the parents let their young die
within a week.
The pheasants have been very eratic in fertility with Coppers, Mikados,
Eliot's and Bar-tails all being clear but Swinhoes and Brown-Ears are very
fertile and we have seven young at present.
We have likewise had good hatches with Bar-head, Snow and Barnacle
Geese and Bahama Pintail.
We have three pairs of Snowy Owls sitting and are keeping our fingers
well and truly crossed, and Barn Owls have three young.
Last year we sent some Californian Quail form America. These birds
have been paired to our own birds and we now have dozens of young quail.
Fertility has been excellent.
One interesting pair is a male Roseate Spoonbill which has paired up
to a Scarlet Ibis. They have built a nest and the Ibis is now sitting.
It would be nice to produce a Scarlet Spoonbill. "

Members will be very grateful to learn of the legacy of #100 made to the Society
in the will of the late James Bailey, Hon. Life Member, who died in April this year,
aged 87.
Jim Bailey, who worked at London Zoo for 44 years, latterly as Overseer of
Birds, was a very gifted aviculturist and many Members will have benefitted from
his knowledge and long experience. Among his many achievements was the
establishment of the Hummingbird House at London Zoo and particularly his
invention of the glass feeding tubes, still used today, whereby humming birds were
successfully kept alive for the first time in Europe.
Jim's death will have saddened many friends and Council would like to record
its appreciation for his contribution to aviculture and his support and interest in
the Society. H. J. Hors well.

I have been commissioned to write a book on the origins of pet names of all kinds.
I am particularly anxious to have a good selection of bird names, and would be
very grateful if members of the Avicultural Society who keep birds as pets would
kindly write to me briefly giving the names of their bird or birds and the reason
for the choice.
I should naturally also appreciate receiving particulars of the species of bird and
short description of its colouring, together with any characteristics which may
have led to the name being given
Any information sent will be duly acknowledged.

{Manacus candei and Chiroxiphia linearis)
By Dr. David Snow (Tring, Herts., England)
The accompanying plate shows the males of two Central American
manakins, the White-collared Manakin ( Manacus candei) and the Long-
tailed Manakin ( Chiroxiphia linearis). These small fruit- and insect-eating
birds, of about the size of tits, belong to a tropical American family and
are not to be confused with the seed-eating mannikins of the Old World
tropics. They are most remarkable for their courtship displays, which
are unsurpassed in complexity and variety.
Males of the White-collared Manakin gather at leks, traditional dancing
areas on the forest floor, where each male clears for himself a " court "
two or three feet across, from which he removes all fallen leaves and any
other debris light enough to be carried away. The basic element of the
display consists of rapid leaps, each accompanied by a loud snap of the
wings, to and fro between upright perches on either side of the court.
Occasionally the bird leaps down to the bare ground of the court and up
again, with a curious grunting sound, to a higher position on the same
perch. The females visit the males at their courts and mating takes
place on one of the upright perches beside the court. The bird in the
plate is shown preparing to make a jump from one upright perch to another.
The white throat feathers are puffed out forwards so that they project as
a beard beyond the tip of the short beak.
The Long-tailed Manakin displays quite differently. Pairs of males
take part in a perfectly coordinated dance on a horizontal or slightly
sloping perch two or three feet above the forest floor, usually in a place
where the undergrowth is thick and observation difficult. In this display
the basic element consists of a jump, with fluttering wings, head held low,
and long tail feathers drooping, accompanied by a curious vibrant call
reminiscent of the twanging of a jew's harp. The two birds jump
alternately; as one lands the other jumps up, and the perfectly timed
alternate jumps, with the rhythmic twanging, may continue for half a
minute or more. When a female visits the display perch the two males
face her, and the jumping then takes the form of a Catherine wheel

revolving before her; as one male jumps he moves back in the air, while
the other hitches himself forward to take his place, jumping as the first
bird lands.
Both of these manakins have traditional sites for their displays, which
apparently persist as long as the forest remains undisturbed. Male and
female have little to do with one another except at the time of mating.
The female alone builds and attends the nest, which is a slight hammock-
like structure slung in a horizontal fork of some low plant. The normal
clutch is invariably two eggs, whitish in ground colour with fairly thick
brownish streaks and mottling. The eggs hatch in about 19 days and the
nestlings remain about 14 days in the nest.

RECENT PARROT BREEDINGS AT THE
SAN DIEGO ZOO
By Dr. Iames M. Dolan, Jr., Director of Animal Sciences
(San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
Psittacines represent the largest single family of birds exhibited in the
San Diego Zoo. They have long been a speciality of the collection and a
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.99804847826087" page_id="56811612"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
number of species and subspecies have reproduced here for the first
time in captivity or in the United States. Between 1st January 1972
and 30th March 1973 a substantial number of hatchings have taken place.
Certainly the most important is that of a Red Shining Parrakeet, Prosopeia
tabuensis splendens on 4th March 1973. Unfortunately this bird died
on 10th April 1973. Two previous clutches were laid by the hen
but these were all infertile. The first clutch consisted of four eggs,
the second three and third three. The adult group of birds is com-
prised of four males and a single female captured in June of 1970 at
Kavala Bay, Kandavu, Fiji Islands. Three males and the female occupy
an aviary twenty feet long by six feet wide by seven feet high in which
are hung two standard grandfather clock nests. All four birds have
proven to be very compatible, and there has been no fighting within the
group. Oddly enough, these birds have never exhibited any noticeable
breeding display. The hen has always spent a great deal of time in the
nesting box, as has been our experience with hen Eclectus, so it is not
possible to give an exact incubation period. The fourth male Red
Shining is housed with a pair of Masked Parrakeets, Prosopeia personata
and as in the case of the Red Shining group, all three birds are compatible.
As far as we are aware this is the first successful rearing of a Red Shining
Parrakeet in captivity. Two further subspecies of P. tabuensis are kept
in the collection: P. t. tabuensis , which to date have shown no inclination
to nest; and P. t. koroensis, which have laid two clutches of infertile eggs.

DR. JAMES M. DOLAN, JR.--PARROT BREEDINGS AT SAN DIEGO ZOO 147
Of almost equal interest is the hatching of a Blue-crowned Lory,
Vini australis on 29th March 1973. The parent birds arrived on 21st
November 1970 from Apia, Western Samoa among a group of five, of
which they are the only survivors. This pair of birds produced three
previous clutches of infertile eggs. Again we believe this to be a first
captive hatching.
Other hatchings among the lories and lorikeets during the 1972-1973
period are as follows: one Red Lory, Eosb. bornea ;four Forsten's Lorikeets,
Trichoglossus h. forsteni; two Edward's Lorikeets, T. h. capistratus; 13
Red-collared Lorikeets, T. h. rubritorque; 20 Ornate Lorikeets, T. ornatus;
14 Scaly-breasted Lorikeets, T. c. chlorolepidotus; 17 Perfect Lorikeets,
Psitteuteles euteles; 14 Mt. Apo Lorikeets, P.johnstonae; two Iris Lorikeets,
P.i.iris; three Blue-thighed Lories, Lorius lory erythrothrorax; nine Yellow-
backed Lories, L. garrulaflavopalliata; and 11 Musk Lorikeets, Glossopsitta
concinna .
Several interesting hybrids have also been hatched. One Burn Red
Lory, Eos bornea cyanonothus x Swainson's Lorikeet, Trichoglossus h.
moluccanus . This particular bird closely resembles Mivart's plate (1896)
of the hybrid Gray's Lorikeet, although the parentage is quite different.
It has proven to be a hen and is now paired with a cock Red-collared
Lorikeet. Since the hybrid bird is a generic cross, it will be interesting
to see if it proves fertile. Four Scaly-breasted, Trichoglossus c. chloro-
lepidotus x Meyer's Lorikeets, Psitteuteles flavoviridis meyeri have been
raised since 22nd November 1971. These birds closely resemble the male
parent except they are somewhat smaller, more plump and unlike the
father have yellow rather than red under-wing coverts. One of these is
now paired with an Iris Lorikeet. A hybrid Black-winged, Eos cyanogenia
x Red Lory, Eos b. bornea was hatched on 2nd February 1973. It is too
early to tell what this bird will look like when it is fully feathered, but for
the present it has begun to grow black feathering on the head and wings
as in the male parent.

Until the study of Giittinger (1970), the Grey-headed Silverbill
(Odontospiza \Lonchura ] caniceps ) was one of the least known of the
mannikins (Lonchurae). Between January 1971 and March 1972 I kept
two wild caught pairs of these estrildids, as well as four males and two
females which were hatched and raised in my home by Striated Finches
(Lonchura striata). I made previously unreported observations on the
behaviour of these individuals. Some of these observations appear to be
of taxonomic importance. In describing displays, the terms " inverted
curtsey ", " lateral pivoting ", and " leap-frogging " used throughout this
paper, are after Morris (1957).
Each breeding pair was kept alone in a cage measuring
22 in. x 18 in. x 21 in. When not breeding, they were kept in a cage
22 in. x 36 in. x 49-5 in. along with some other estrildids. The birds
were colour-banded for individual recognition.

Giittinger (1970) describes the courtship display of this species as
follows: The male grasps a grass stem by one end in the manner of many
other estrildids. He flies before the female, then performs inverted
curtsies accompanied by song. The inverted curtsey is a bobbing
movement in which the main component is an upward thrust imparted by a
straightening of the legs. The female then performs inverted curtsies in
synchrony with the male, but without song or a grass stem. After a while,
the male drops his grass stem, and turning his bill and tail in the direction
of the female, sings his long song. The male's display is often
accompanied by bowing (the " low twist posture " of Moynihan and Hall,
1954), which in turn often passes to displacement bill wiping. The above
ceremony may also be initiated by the female, if she flies before the male
and begins inverted curtsies. This display is infrequently, though
regularly, performed during pair-formation and before the laying of the
first egg. In contrast to most other estrildids, the inverted curtsey display
of this mannikin has never been observed to lead to copulation. Frequently
the display is followed by allopreening, or both partners feed. Giittinger
(1970: 1052) has suggested that this display functions to stimulate and
synchronize mated pairs.

The display of my wild-trapped male Left-Yellow (LY) was as follows:
With bill mandibulating and pointed at an angle skywards, head and tail
turned towards the female, and belly slightly fluffed, LY would sing his
long song. If the female changed perches, he would follow her, keeping
the same posture and continuing to sing whenever he landed next to her.
If she remained still, he would approach her in short hops, while still
singing and posturing. Sometimes the female would respond with tail
quivering in typical estrildid manner. Irrespective of the female's
behaviour, the male would often fly on her back, attempting to copulate.
Usually he would leap-frog off. Only on one occasion did copulation
ensue.
LY's display was similar to the second part of the display described by
Giittinger (1970). The position and movements of the bill were similar
to that seen in solitary song (Giittinger, loc. cit.), however, the lateral
pivoting movements of the head were absent. Only on one occasion did
LY perform inverted curtsies during courtship. Although there were
always grass stems in the cage which LY utilized in nest-building, these
were never used in display.
The display of my second wild trapped male, Left-White (LW),
differed markedly from that of LY. His display may be divided into the
following two parts: (i) the submissive courtship portion (terminology
after Goodwin, 1965) and (ii) the inverted curtsey portion. The first
display was usually followed by the second, although each could be
performed without the other.
Submissive Courtship. In this display, the male crouched on a perch
next to the female. The feathers of the belly were fluffed and covered
most of the legs with only part of the toes showing. Its body was bent
slightly away from the female. With head and sometimes the tail pointed
in her direction, with bill wide open, and tongue protruding and moving
back and forth, the male sang to her. Frequently, the male's wing distal
to the female was flicked out and in very rapidly several times during
singing (Fig. 1). A second male, Right-Black (RB), the offspring of LW,
was observed performing this display twice. This display is similar to
that described for other estrildids, for example, the species of Uraeginthus
(Goodwin, 1965). In the Red Avadavat ( Amandava amandava ), a similar
display is given, but only to strange females (Kunkel, 1959; Goodwin,
i960).
Inverted Curtsey. After a period of singing in the crouched position,
male LW erected himself. With bill still wide open, tongue still
protruding and moving back and forth, head and tail pointed towards the
female, and belly feathers slightly fluffed, the male performed inverted
curtsies. At higher intensity the body was bent away from the female
(Fig. 2) and inverted curtsies were alternated with lateral pivoting
movements of the body. When performing inverted curtsies, the male
slowly approached the female in a series of small hops. Sometimes he

danced away from the female. Inverted curtsies were interspersed with
bows and or displacement bill wipes. Sometimes the male merely
nodded at the female, probably an intention movement to bow (Morris,
1958). On a few occasions, double bows were observed, one bow followed
immediately by another. As in submissive courtship display, the wing
distal to the female was often flicked out and in very rapidly. On one
occasion (19th February 1972) the wing was also quivered as in juvenile
begging display (Giittinger, 1970).
The female sometimes responded with inverted curtsey displays. On
rare occasions this was followed by tail quivering. Copulation was
observed only twice (see below).
LW and LY's displays could be elicited by reintroducing their females
to them after a short period of separation. When not breeding, LW would
display to any strange conspecific, irrespective of its sex, when the latter
was introduced into the cage holding him and his mate. When breeding,
LW would ignore or attack strange conspecifics introduced into its
breeding cage.
Three other males, offspring of LY, were observed performing stem
displays as described by Giittinger (1970). These were never at high
intensity, as observations were made when the birds were still juveniles.

Copulation
At 6.47 p.m. on 9th February 1971 a successful copulation was
observed between male LY and his mate Right-Red (RR). I was sitting
about 3 ft. from their breeding cage when I heard LY complete two
songs. I looked up to see LY on RR's back, his wings fluttering rapidly
and tail thrust under hers in the act of coition. After dismounting he
flew back and forth between two perches placed ft. apart. He next
flew beside the female, and both birds then engaged in displacement
autopreening. At 6.54 p.m. the same day LY performed the same display
described earlier. He flew on his mate's back in an attempt to mount her
but she did not respond. RR laid her first egg on 15th February 1971.
On 1st January 1972 male LW was observed performing high intensity
display to his mate (unbanded). She solicited with tail quivering, her
head was slightly upturned and bill wide open. The male leap-frogged
over her back four times, but no copulation ensued.
A copulation was observed between the same pair on 12th February
1972. The male displayed at full intensity, and the female solicited
copulation with the tail quivering, her head slightly upturned, and bill
wide open. After leap-frogging off her back twice, the male finally
mounted. He stood perched on her back with tail widely spread for a few
seconds, during which time the female's tail was still quivering. He
finally copulated with her. After he had dismounted and flown to another
perch, the female was seen performing inverted curtsies. At 12 noon on
27th February 1972 LW displayed to his mate at high intensity and the
female solicited with tail quivering. The male leap-frogged off her back
once, then copulated with her. The female performed displacement bill
wiping after coitus, and the male preened his belly.

There appears to be individual variation in the displays of Grey-headed
Silverbills. Whereas inverted curtsies were always performed by LW,
they were rare in LY's displays. Whereas stem displays were performed
by Giittinger's birds and three of the four offspring hatched in my bird
room, I could never induce LW or LY to use stems in their displays.
Moreover, displaying with bill wide open and tongue wagging were
observed only in two birds (LW and RB).
Individual variation of this degree is not unusual among the Lonchurae.
In the Cherry Finch (Aidemosyne modesta ), for example, males also have a
stem display, followed by singing with bill wide open. However,
Immelmann (1965) informs us that: " ... there is great individual variation
in this species. Some males never use a piece of grass, others never sing
with bill wide open. . .
Copulation has not hitherto been described for the Grey-headed
Silverbill. It has been suggested that for the Grey-headed Silverbill and
in forms of Spermestes, copulation takes place normally inside the nest

(Giittinger 1970, Kunkel 1965). Kunkel (1965 : 175) observed only one
copulation for Spermestes ( Lonchura ) bicolor. However, Morris (1957)
was of the opinion that with the Bronze Mannikin ( Spermestes [Lonchura\
cucullata ) copulation on a branch was the usual method, suggesting that he
must have observed this more than once. It may not be too unusual then,
for the Grey-headed Silverbill to occasionally copulate on a branch in the
usual estrildid manner. Indeed, several aviculturists (summarized in
Immelmann et al. 1972, in press) have also observed tail quivering by
female Grey-headed Silverbills in response to the courtship dance of the
male. An alternative interpretation of these observations would be that
this is an artifact of captivity (see Immelmann et al., loc. cit.), that awaits
verification by field study. It is noteworthy that the bill open, head up
posture of one of my soliciting female Grey-headed Silverbills was also
observed in Bronze Mannikins by Morris (1957). Females of the latter
species, however, also protrude their tongue when soliciting. Morris
(loc. cit.) considered these to be important components of the female's
display, derived from the nest building elements of " mandibulating and
scooping
Derivation of Display Components. The submissive courtship display
of the Grey-headed Silverbill is very likely derived from the begging
display of the juvenile. The posture of the head (Figs. 1 and 2), the
waving tongue and wide open bill are all found in the begging juvenile,
which does not always twist its head in the more usual estrildid manner
(Personal observation). Giittinger (1970) reported that young Grey-
headed Silverbills also quiver their wings when begging. Wing quivering
is rare in estrildid finches, and has been described in Aeginthia temporalis ,
Erythrura prasina (Giittinger 1970, Immelmann 1965) and Lagonosticta
rubricata (Goodwin, 1964). Friedmann (i960 : 25) reported that
nestlings of Estrilda subflava " move one or sometimes both wings forward
in a jerking, spasmodic gesture ". My observations indicate that in
begging juveniles of Grey-headed Silverbills the wing distal from the
parent bird with food is also often slightly extended. The flicking distal
wing in the submissive courtship display of the Grey-headed Silverbill is
probably an intention movement to extend and quiver that wing. This
opinion was held by Goodwin (1965) who made similar observations on
species of Uraeginthus. I have reported on one observation of a Grey-
headed Silverbill quivering a wing during courtship.
Relationship to Spermestes. LW's completed display was similar in
many respects to that of the Bronze Mannikin as described by Morris
(1957). The Bronze Mannikin also begins its courtship dance with a
crouched display, with the bill open, and the tongue protruding and
moving. This is followed by an inverted curtsey display, and lateral
pivoting when performed at higher intensity. Morris' birds also danced
toward and away from the female, and leap-frogging was described. The
similar postures of the soliciting females of the two species have been

discussed. The differences between LW's displays and those of the
Bronze Mannikin are that (i) LW's bill was pointed up whereas that of
the Bronze Mannikin was pointed down, (ii) Wing flicks were absent
from the display of the Bronze Mannikin, (iii) The tongue was moved
more rapidly (quivered) in the Bronze Mannikin, (iv) Soliciting female
Bronze Mannikins protruded their tongues.
Subsequent to Morris' (1957) study of the Bronze Mannikin, Kunkel
(1959, 1965) and Giittinger (1970) have studied and compared courtship
displays of all the forms of Spermestes. The last two authors both
concluded that courtship displays of all forms of Spermestes are similar,
but with quantitative differences with regard to the frequency of
occurrence of the display components.
The Grey-headed Silverbill has been placed by some authors in the
genus (or subgenus) Euodice along with the two Silverbills Euodice
(Lonchura) malabarica and E. (L.) cantans (see review in Giittinger, 1970).
Giittinger (1970; and personal observations) has shown that in a number
of behavioural characters (vocalizations, fighting postures, copulation in
the nest, absence of peering behaviour) the Grey-headed Silverbill more
closely resembles the African mannikins of the genus (or subgenus)
Spermestes. My observations on the epigamic displays of LW and RB
indicate that the courtship displays of the Grey-headed Silverbill, although
variable, fall within the range of variation of that of species of Spermestes ,
lending support to Giittinger's conclusion of their close relationship.
The use of the vernacular " Grey-headed Silverbill " for Odontospiza
(Lonchura) caniceps would seem misleading, therefore, because it implies
a close relationship to the Silverbills (Euodice). I propose the name
" Pearl-headed Mannikin " for this distinctive estrildid, a name similar
to the German " Perlhalsamadine ".

By Rae Anderson (Sierra Madre, California, U.S.A.)
Twenty years ago with the help of Dave West I got started with lutino
Indian ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri manillensis ). Then again
with Dave's help I started with the blue variety. Since then I have been
working the hard, slow way from the original birds with split (recessive)
factors towards birds that could produce the albino. The anticipation
was like that of a child waiting for Christmas with packages beckoning
under the tree.
A few years ago I was successful in getting a lutino cock and blue hen to
accept each other. This in itself was a project requiring several years.
Then finally one baby was hatched, a green male split to both yellow and
blue. Then a yellow hen split to blue and two more cocks, and a year
later another hen. This year they hatched a single cock which died
within a few days after hatching. I swapped two of these young " split-
both-way " cock birds with Dave West and John Furniss to reduce
inbreeding.
This season a two-year-old pair started work particularly early with a
clutch of three eggs in early January, 1972. On 12th February, these
eggs appeared to be clear and were removed. The nest was then checked
on 24th March, some two or three weeks after the hen seemed to be
incubating again. At this time there were four eggs. On 1st April the
nest was again inspected and to my exaltation and amazement, there
were three pink-eyed babies. These appeared to be about five days old.
This breeding combination can produce green, yellow, blue and albino
but the probability of an albino is I believe about 1 in 8. The three
pink-eyed babies immediately ruled out all greens and blues in this clutch
and brought the albino possibility down to about 1 in 3. With three
pink-eyed babies this means an almost certainty of having one albino.
Of course, my anticipation was almost without bounds but I did not
want to take the nest box down and open it unless the hen was out. For
the past two weeks if she was not already in the box she had made a dive
for it whenever she saw any of us approaching her aviary. I felt that by
this weekend, 22nd April, the babies would be old enough so that their

pin feathers would be opening and would be too large to be injured by
the hen's scrambling if I opened the box with her inside.
Upon opening the box in the somewhat subdued light of the aviary
shelter with one of my sons, and while we were looking for the possible
white baby, my immediate reaction was one of disappointment at seeing
only two babies. This disappointment was very short lived, however,
as my son recognized before I did that one of the babies was indeed an
albino and that it was the larger of the two. The third baby appeared to
have been dead about a week. It was decomposed beyond recognition
except that a few tiny yellow feathers were apparent. The fourth baby was
never found.
I feel very fortunate that the bad odour of the dead baby had not caused
the mother to abandon the clutch. We had, however, been checking at
least every morning and evening to be sure that she was in the nest.
I removed the albino from the nest for hand raising because of Harold
Rudkin's experience of the hen killing her white baby. This was probably
due to its " odd" colour. I could not risk this because my breeding
combination was identical to Rud's.
It is my understanding that the albino raised by the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm in 1963 (the first recorded albino Indian Ringneck) was a
female. From the colour genetics of its parents (Cummings, 1964) the
only albino possibility from this breeding is a hen. This bird
unfortunately died before reaching maturity.
Harold Rudkin then hatched the one that, shortly after its pin feathers
opened, was killed by its parents. Post-mortem examination proved this
baby to be a cock. Its skin is now in the collection of the Los Angeles
County Natural History Museum. Then in 1968, Mr. Rudkin was again
successful in producing an albino. This time, however, from parents
with a different colour genetic combination which could only produce
albino hens. This breeding is related in the American Aviculture Bulletin ,
October, 1970. In 1969 Dr. Swaenepoel in Belgium successfully
raised one. As stated (Swaenepoel, 1970) this bird had to be a hen.
I understand that it is now in the collection of Alfredo Marques. My baby,
however, has a 50-50 chance of being a cock based on the colour genetics
of its parents. This is from the same breeding combination as Mr.
Rudkin's first which was a cock.
At this time the bird is a full grown perfectly proportioned specimen,
having been independent since June, 1972. I am not able to do more than
guess at its sex because I have neither observed it to display nor other
known males to display to it. I am, of course, hoping for a cock.
I am still uncertain as to whether or not the pink neck ring will appear
if it is a cock. While I hope that the pink ring will be there, I do not
believe that this will be the case. The pink ring might well occur with
natural accidental albinism, but I do not think we will see it with
" albinos " developed from yellow-blue breedings. In our aviary

developed " albinos " the bird is actually a pink eyed blue (dilute--having
lost the melanin) bird. Since it is basically a blue bird with pink eyes
and since blue cocks have white neck rings, I suspect that our " albino "
factor will produce white birds with white neck rings. I am most anxious
for this to be proven one way or the other.
This year, 1973, another albino Indian Ringneck has been produced
in California. This was in the aviaries of another aviculturist. This
bird is now independent and an excellent specimen. It is from the same
genetic combination of parents as is mine. This now brings to three the
number of living albinos in Southern California. We believe that this
is the total number existing in the United States.

THE PAPUAN LORIKEET
By Rosemary Low (New Barnet, Herts., England)
The Papuan Lorikeet ( Charmosyna papou papou ) is virtually unknown
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.999144826086957" page_id="56811624"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
in aviculture and almost nothing seems to have been recorded about it.
There is, however, a plate of this species in Mivart's Monograph of the
Loridae. I never anticipated seeing any of the members of this genus
alive, let alone having the opportunity to keep one--but in aviculture
unexpected events are always happening, particularly regarding the
availability of species.
When a friend telephoned me in September 1972 to tell me that she
was about to import a Stella's Lorikeet (C. p . stellae ) I was at first in-
credulous and, a few days later, on seeing the bird, completely captivated.
The Charmosyna Lorikeets are among the most beautiful birds in the world
and this individual was hand-reared and completely fearless, thus adding
to its attraction. When I was asked if I would like to look after it for a
time, my reply was naturally in the affirmative!
On closely examining the Lorikeet, I realized that it was not Stella's;
its description agreed with that for the Papuan given by Salvadori in his
Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum --except for one point. Salvadori
gave the length as " from 16*9 to 14-93 inches, tail from io-6 to 8*23 "--
yet this bird measured only 11 inches or 12 inches. The mystery was
solved when the Papuan moulted its tail (which as the photograph shows,
was rather frayed); this was replaced by an 8 inch tail to give a total length
of approximately 14 inches. The tail is reminiscent of that of a Fischer's
Whydah (Vidua fischeri) in that it tapers almost to a hair's width. When
the tail feathers are spread the beauty of each feather can be seen. There

is a red patch on one side of the web, also a yellow patch which extends
to the side of the web which is mainly green.
This species is extremly slim in build and cannot be compared in this
respect with any of the more familiar species of Lorikeet. The shape of
the head and beak are, to me, reminiscent of certain Hanging Parrots

The colouring of the Papuan Lorikeet is particularly attractive. The
wings and the upper side of the tail are dark green, the underside of the
tail and the tip of the upper side being yellow. The head and underparts
are scarlet with a darker sheen on the upper breast. There is an almost
square patch of colour on the crown, which is dark blue at the front,
becoming black. Further back, on the nape, there is a crescent-shaped
black patch. There is also a black patch on the abdomen which meets
the black of the front of the thighs, the thighs being yellow at the back.
The lower rump is decorated with a patch of dark blue.
The feet are pinkish and the nails black; beak orange; iris orange with
a very narrow ring of paler orange which is noticeable only on close
inspection.
The Charmosyna Lorikeets are sexually dimorphic, thus I know that
the bird in my temporary possession was a male. Salvadori described
the female as follows: " The red feathers on the sides of the rump have
the base yellow; a yellow-orange patch over the yellow spot above the
thighs."
He stated that in immature birds the nape, abdomen and thighs (which
are black in adult birds) are dark green.
Being hand-reared, the Papuan loves attention and would display as
soon as I spoke to it. In display, the yellow patches on the thighs stand
away from the body. A soft whistling noise is made and one foot is
lifted and waved, more rarely both feet in turn.
The flight is unlike that of the more familiar Lorikeets, no doubt
partly due to the fact that the long tail holds the bird back to a certain
degree. Another characteristic is the way in which a perfectly straight
line of flight was never taken, the bird always flying upwards just before
landing.
The Papuan refused fruit and small seeds. Its diet consisted of nectar
made from equal amounts of honey and malt, with the occasional addition
of condensed milk, with the same mixture added to trifle sponge. The
Papuan was particularly fond of the latter. Every day several drops of
the orange-flavoured multi-vitamin preparation Vitavel were added to
the sponge cake and nectar. On this somewhat monotonous diet the
Papuan thrived--in fact I have seldom seen a fitter and more active bird.
It bathed every day and kept itself in immaculate condition.
After nine months in my care, the Papuan was sold to a fellow member
of the Avicultural Society. I am pleased to record that it now resides
in a 20 ft. planted aviary, in a collection of small softbills, where it is
greatly admired by all who see it.

non-flying juveniles in Iquitos, Peru, have been observed since 17th
August 1963 (male) and 14th September 1964 (female) by A. E. Goodman

The birds live in an outdoor aviary 6 ft. x 10 ft. x 10 ft. with a natural
ground floor, natural perches, and tropical planting. Each bird daily
consumes two or three day-old chickens from a supply kept continually
available, with an occasional dead rat or mouse as offered. The male has
been seen to catch and eat a Cuban tree frog [Hyla septentrionalis).
Cardinals, Mockingbirds and warblers enter the aviary without molesta-
tion. Neither owl has been observed to drink.
Nesting and Incubation
Breeding behaviour was first initiated by the male in February 1966.
His soft night hooting became louder, with an aggressive tone. He made
rudimentary nest scrapes, profferred food to the female, which she
refused, and attempted copulation. This behaviour continued inter-
mittently until the first egg was laid on 6th April 1969. Since then 10
clutches have been incubated, three with four eggs each, seven with three.
The male makes several shallow scrapes at each nesting. Originally
these were primitive, but they have developed until the last was a depression
about seven inches in diameter, deepened by the female during brooding
to three quarters of an inch. The only nesting material is litter such as
bits of leaves which the female may pull in while sitting, and stuff under
her breast.
Eggs are unspotted pinkish-buff. The only one measured was
4-7 mm. x 5*5 mm. Apparently they are laid before mid-morning at
approximately 60 hour intervals. Incubation is by the female only and
starts with the first egg. The period to hatching is approximately 33 days.
The time differential in four clutches where two chicks were hatched was
judged to be from one to five days. During her first incubation the female
often left the nest for periods of time, even in rain. Thereafter during

the first two weeks of each brooding she left very briefly, only once or
twice a day, to defecate. She is fed on demand, by the male. Eggs are
turned with the bill. The nests have been moved several times from
one to five feet, either with eggs, or chicks in them. In one instance
the chick was three weeks old. The method was not observed, nor the
method by which the nest is always kept clean. The female has been
observed eating the hatchling's shell. A downpour flooded the nest
11 days before one successful hatching until for 15 minutes only the
incubating bird's head was above water. Weather of this sort would be
typical in the range of this tropical species.
Clutch
Only one chick is raised. A second chick may hatch, appear healthy,
but disappear within a week. The other eggs of the clutch are kicked
out during incubation and shortly disappear. In three clutches where one
chick hatched one survived, two disappeared within five days each.

Brooding
A chick is closely brooded in the nest for about two weeks. To
accommodate its rapid growth the female deepens the nest and broods with
arched wings. She maintains this posture, wings arched, head bent over
the young, while feeding for some time after the chick has emerged from
the nest. Small pieces of food are gathered into a mouthful and proffered
with a special cluck, the chick taking the food from her bill. If alarmed
she signals the chick to return under her wing by rapping it on the crown.
The chick signals its desire for shelter by pecking at the joint of her wing
and shoulder until the wing is raised. When a chick has grown too large
to brood she backs up against it and raises her wings over it. It is sheltered
from rain by this means until it is almost full grown.
When first out of the nest the small chick sleeps flat out on the ground,
neck extended, feet tucked under. The female shelters it from sun by a
raised wing, or her shadow cast from a perch above it. Even when
full-grown a chick will lean against the female when resting; and the
female was seen to leave a new clutch of eggs untended several times to
feed a 50 day old chick that was refusing to accept food from the male.
Both parents watch the chick closely at all times. The female stays
physically closer, the male is more nervous at human approach to the
aviary, and more agitated by the mishaps of flight, or failures in self-
feeding of his young.
Bill as a tool
There is some evidence of the bill being used as a tool. Small chicks,
unsteady, may fall into the bloody carcasses of the chickens from which
their food is coming. The female has been observed to gather pieces of
dried leaves in her bill and to use them to wipe the blood from both
faces and breasts of the young. With many avian species a chick that
falls from the nest, or gets into physical difficulty will be ignored and left
to die. One of these young owls attempting flight after clambering up
the aviary wire to a high perch, crash-landed in the base of a palm tree
and became helplessly wedged among the stiff stalks. Both parents were
much agitated. The female flew down and pulled aside one of the stiff
stalks until the chick was freed.
Communication
Except when the female is on the nest mating is frequent. The
voices of all these owls have been distinctive, and they are strongly
communicative. There is much soft, low, conversational hooting by
day as well as by night. On the nest the female clucks when she wishes
food brought to her and she has been observed to cluck persistently until
the male removed unwanted food. If he delays in attending her she
becomes agitated and screams. It is the female who shrieks alarm at
nocturnal possums or other animals coming about the aviary at night.

The first warning sound given by the male when disturbed is similar to
the heavy breathing of a human. With continuing disturbance he will
click his bill rapidly, hiss and spread his wings. In full attack he is
soundless, but hits the aviary wire with great force.
By the 18th day all three birds eat at the nest. The female does not
permit the male to feed his young until after she has done so. Later,
when she is teaching an older chick to pick its own food, if the male
attempts to aid the unskilled young she interposes herself, often screaming,
until he retreats. On the other side of the coin, when the eggs of a clutch
(that failed) were left unattended, the male was much agitated; and another
time, when the female left a nest after heavy rain to spread her wings in
the sun, the male screamed at her until, still wet, she returned. Again,
a few-day-old chick was seen abandoned out of the nest, extended on
the earth, ignored by the female. The male flew hooting about the aviary
until finally she scooped the chick up with her bill and tucked it under
her. Then he quieted. (The chick disappeared that night.) Chick
A, a female, was removed to a second aviary, where she lives with a
Spectacled Owl ( Pulsatrix perspicullata). They copulate and she sits on
infertile eggs. But during the mating season she calls constantly to the
male of her own species a few feet away. Another chick, removed from
its parents at 60 days (as the female was sitting on a new clutch) was also
put in with the Spectacled Owl, who preened, and fed it. Both chick and
parents cried back and forth to each other for many days.
The following timetables are roughly applicable to the development
of all five young, as the growth patterns have been similar.

By J. V. Beer (The Game Conservancy, Fordingbridge, Hants.)
and
Janet Kear (The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucester, England)
Cladosporium herbarum , a common fungus present on plants, organic
debris and in the air, is also known as a pathogen on the plumage of
captive flamingos (Beer 1969). It forms black sclerotia within the feathers,
rupturing the cortex and weakening the structure so that the distal
portions of the feather barbs break off (see the plate). The plumage of
the back becomes dingy and frayed, and the birds are wet and miserable-
looking. At Slimbridge, the condition has sometimes seriously affected
the Chilean form Phoenicopterus chilensis in the late autumn and, to a
lesser extent, the Andean Phoenicoparrus andinus and James' P. jamesi
species.
The mould is slow growing at an optimum temperature of 24-25*C.
At 27*C, the growth rate is halved and at 3o*C, spore germination is
completely prevented. Below 24*C and down to o*C, development is
sluggish, although sub-zero temperatures are necessary to prevent growth
altogether. At o*C, a colony on an agar culture will be 2-3 mm. across
in 2-3 months. Because of this temperature relationship, only the
flamingos' outer feathers, away from the bird's body heat, are affected
(the scapulars are especially prone) but, conversely, cold winter weather
will not entirely inhibit growth. The spores also survive dehydration
and, because they are heavily pigmented, do not succumb to light. Thus
treatment is difficult.
Badly affected feathers can be pulled out or cut off. Dusting with a
fungicidal powder only affects the hyphae deep in the feather with
difficulty. Raising the ambient temperature to 30*C should stop growth,
but only while heat is applied; in any case, this temperature level will not
kill the mould. At Slimbridge, we have tended merely to wait for the
birds to moult.
In the autumn of 1972, the Chilean Flamingos were seen to be partic-
ularly badly affected. There had been severe attacks by aphids
(greenfly) on three of the willow trees in their pen that summer. The
leaf surfaces had become coated with the sugary honey-dew secreted by
the insects and later covered with a black mould which had apparently
caused the leaves to fall. By December, the tree trunks were still thickly
powdered with a sooty mould and from this C. herbarum was cultured in
the laboratory.
Of all the willow species in the Wildfowl Trust grounds, only the
Osiers Salix viminalis are badly affected by greenfly. These trees have
been eliminated. The source of infection in the Andean and James,

Flamingo pen appeared to be a balsam poplar Populus gileadensis , the
trunk of which has now been painted with malathion.
It is too early to say whether this treatment will prevent mould outbreaks
on the flamingos' plumage in the future. Clearly, in summers when
aphids are especially common, the vegetation in the vicinity of colonies
needs periodic examination. Cladosporium spores cannot be completely
removed from the environment, since they are the commonest fungal
component of the airspora, but gross local contaminations can probably
be checked.
Apparently C. herb arum does not act as a pathogen in other birds, and
the captive waterfowl sharing the habitat of the flamingos at Slimbridge
are unaffected. The mould is opportunistic and can grow on a weakly
nutritive substrate. If the bird washes itself in water contaminated with
food and faeces, then the materials adhering to the feather surface provide
a substrate on which initial mould growth is possible. This does not
explain why the particular fungus invades the structure of flamingo
feathers. C. herbarum is clearly able to pass through the keratin walls;
the action may be mechanical or enzymic. In vitro , isolates from infected
feathers appear to cause no change in the structure of mammalian hair,
although growth is vigorous (Clayton and De Vries, pers. com.). Damaged
feathers would be more easily invaded, but only a minute hole is needed.
Perhaps keratinisation is less complete in flamingos thus facilitating
penetration, and at the same time providing a richer substrate on which
the fungus grows and produces the hyphal masses which damage the
barbs. Perhaps the preen gland oil is fungistatic in resistant avian

(Tangara nigrocincta )
By C. Miller, Jr. (Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A.)
In the spring of 1973 I succeeded for the first time in breeding my pair
of Masked or Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers. The breeding took place in a
flight 8 ft. x 6 ft. x 7 ft. high, located in the third floor unfinished attic of
my home in Baltimore. In the flight along with the tanagers were some
18 other birds, all seed-eaters. The tanagers attempted to breed several
times before succeeding. Following are the details and background of
their breeding history.
I obtained them in November, 1971 from Canary Bird Farm in New
Jersey. Walt Frey accurately picked out a pair from a South American
shipment for me. I housed them in the above-mentioned flight; the
other birds with them were: 1 pr. Java Sparrows, 2 pr. African (Red-billed)
Firefinches, 3 pr. Yellow-bellied or Swee Waxbills, 1 pr. Orange-cheeked
Waxbills, 1 Red-eared Waxbill, 1 pr. Starfinches, 2 pr. Cut-throats,
1 Jacarini cock, 1 Red-billed Weaver, 1 pr. Button Quail. The Cut-
throats and the Weaver were removed before breeding occurred.
In October, 1972 the Tanagers nested, laid one egg, but did not incubate
it. They nested a second time 17th December 1972, laying two eggs in a
wicker finch nest using only a little hair and string as lining. The eggs
hatched in 14 days. The weather at this time was bitterly cold, and,
since my attic is uninsulated, temperature there was chilly. On 8th
January the temperature at 7 a.m. was 45*F. It rose to 51 as a high that
day. I noticed then that all the birds in the flight increased their
consumption of live food (meal worms and fruit flies) considerably.
On 9th January it was again 45*F at 7 a.m. On 10th January I fed live
food at eight in the evening. I noticed then that the tanagers did not feed
this to the young immediately as they had been doing. On checking I
found both babies stone cold and dead.
On 20th January I was distressed to see that the hen looked a little puffy.
I kept an eye on her, and noticed that two days later she was missing.
A check revealed a tail sticking out of the wicker nest, which incidentally
they had defended as theirs all along. With a mirror I looked into the
nest and found two light blue, speckled eggs. One of these hatched on
4th February the other failed to hatch. The young was found dead on
the floor of the flight on the evening of 7th February. Thus ended
round 2. I should add that this time around I fed plenty of live food in
the form of mealworms, corn grubs, and small crickets.
The next round began with a first egg on 18th February 1973. Needless
to say, my enthusiasm had died down a bit by now. A second egg was
laid on the 19th, and both of these hatched on time on 4th and 5th March.
Although the parents were feeding, I removed the young on 6th March

and gave them to Fred Beall, principal keeper at the Baltimore Zoo,
for hand feeding. Both lived until ioth March. They had been fed
soaked dog chow along with flakes of apple and orange.
The next round commenced with the hatching of one out of two eggs
on 4th April. Although I fully expected this young one to be thrown out
of the nest also, the parents continued to feed it. On 14th April I noticed
that its eyes were open, and on 18th April it fledged. On 22nd April I
banded the fledgling with the number AS-73-H289.
On 23 rd April the hen laid another egg (she had looked puffy on the
21 st; apparently this is a sign that she is manufacturing an egg). A second
egg appeared on the 24th. On 4th May the fledgling tanager, at four
weeks of age, was still being fed by its father. On 7th May I saw it feed
itself for the first time, though later in the evening (and subsequently as
late as 12th May) I saw the cock bird feeding it also.
On 8th May the firstborn of nest no. six hatched, the other egg again
failing to hatch. On 13th May at 8.30 a.m. I found this chick dead on
the cage floor. I think it was thrown out, or at least died, because of
insufficient live food this time around.
On 20th May the six-week-old fledgling tanager began chasing the tiny
waxbills for sport, so I caught him up and removed him from the aviary.
On fledging, the bird's colour was overall a charcoal grey suffused with
blue. The belly was paler grey. The beak was black with gape marks
of ivory. At the time of writing it has developed its blue shoulder patches
and is fast developing its white abdomen and coppery nape. On fledging,
its tail was very short, but it could fly well enough to keep off the floor.
The food available to its parents during the time it was in the nest is
as follows: apple, orange, banana (occasionally), peanut butter, Prunty
insectile (mockingbird) mix, Purina dog chow soaked 30 min. in cold
water, finch mix, Scarlett's " wild seed " mixture, Stimulite nectar
formula, and live food, including a fruit fly culture.
Some observations on the breeding behaviour of these birds: First,
the female does all the incubation. Second, for the initial 14 days, the
parents feed only live food to the young. Third, like most monogamous
birds, the male assumes most of the responsibility for feeding the young
after fledging, while the female goes back to nest. It is interesting to note
that these birds are supposed to build an open cup nest in nature, but
chose a covered wicker finch nest in my aviary. Finally, I might add
that the Calliste tanagers are not quite the " hothouse flowers " that most
writers state they are. Mine took a low temperature of 34 degrees this
winter, with no ill effects. Success with the Masked has spurred me to
try breeding other species of the group; I have a true pair of Speckled
Tanagers ( T . chrysophrys) which were observed mating by me and by
Mr. A. G. Scott of Toledo, in March. Perhaps they will be next!
As verification of the authenticity of the Masked's breeding, I had
Shon Ross of Baltimore observe the parents feeding the young before

BREEDING THE ORTOLAN BUNTING
{Emberiza hortulana )
By John F. Dowling (Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, England)

<bodyText confidence="0.996771470588236" page_id="56811641"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
During the winter of 1971-2 I received from a member of ASPEBA
living in Spain a pair of Ortolan Bunting, Emberiza hortulana , which he
had hand-reared. The male of this species is brown with dark streaking
on back, wings and tail, russet-buff below, with an olive-green head and
upper breast, and yellow on throat, moustache-streak and a thin ring
around the eye. The female is browner on head and breast and has
dark spots on the upper breast. The head feathers form a slight, peak-
like crest at times.
Not having kept this species before and wishing to keep them warm I
put them in a flight cage, 4 ft. 6 in. x 1 ft. 3 in. x 1 ft. 6 in., in my bird-
room during the winter months and in the spring of 1972 put them in an
outside flight, partly sheltered, 9 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft., together with three
greenfinches, Carduelis chloris. They were given a seed mixture but
appeared to eat hardly anything except plain canary seed and maggots.
Some softfood was available and they were also given 5-6 mealworms a
day, which they ate.
Thinking that they would nest low like a Yellowhammer I made several
nest-sites close to the ground among growing hops and a small elderberry
bush; while for the Greenfinches I also put in wicker baskets surrounded
with a little evergreen foliage fixed about 4 ft. 6 in. up. During that
season the hen bunting built a complete nest in one of the finch baskets,
and then started a second directly on the ground in the open, ignoring the
nesting sites in the hops. As far as I know no eggs were laid.
I saw virtually no courtship behaviour, apart from the fact that the cock
occasionally offered live food to the hen, and also offered the dried grass
used as nesting material. The cock sang his rather simple song usually in
the late evening, continuing at times into the night and early morning.
During this season the greenfinches bred successfully in the same aviary,
ignored by the buntings.
I wintered the pair outside, and this spring, 1973, they started to carry
nest material in late April; but before the hen could begin laying she was
scalped and killed by the cock. During the subsequent breeding season,
when the Greenfinches nested, the cock bunting tried to feed the young
and interfered so much that I had to remove him.

During the autumn of 1972 I had received a second pair of these bun-
tings. The male of this pair was very nervous, less brightly coloured and
with a slightly dropped wing. The female was very boldly coloured and
quite green on head and breast. I caged them for the winter as I had
with the first pair and a few days after they came was surprised to find an
egg on the cage floor. It was cracked so I broke it and found it to be
fertile. The female did not then lay any more.
In May 1973 I put this pair in a flight 10 ft. x 4 ft. x 6 ft. 6 in. high,
with access to a raised compartment in a bird-room 6 ft. x ift. 6 in. x
2 ft. 6 in. high. The outside flight had plenty of growing honeysuckle
and a small yew bush, and again I made some nest-sites at about ground
level. I had never heard this second cock sing, nor seen any kind of
mating or courtship behaviour, but early in June I noticed a lot of dried
grass on the floor of the inside flight, which is wooden and painted glossy
white. It looked as though the hen had tried to build a nest in one corner
but could not shape it because of the slippery floor.
I was not quite sure what to do but in the end I put three clods of dry
earth around one corner of the inside flight leaving enough room behind
them for a nest. The site was ignored for several days, but on 24 June the
hen started building here and on 25 June it looked finished. One egg
was laid in the nest on 27 June and others on the two subsequent days.
On 29 June the hen was on the nest. This was the first time I had seen
her anywhere near it. When I fed the birds that evening I found a
soft-shelled egg on the floor, so I presumed that she was sitting on three.
During the incubation period I saw the hen off the nest only two or
three times. She usually sat very tight even when I was moving about
and feeding birds. Two young hatched from the eggs on 12 July and
the third egg did not hatch. On 15 July one young one was dead. After
this date I often found the hen off the nest, but the remaining young one,
which was covered with whitish down, always appeared well-fed. During
this period I fed the small maggots sold as " squats " and small mealworms
J to  |in. long, later putting cut mealworms on softfood. The hen was
seen carrying these but I have never seen either parent actually feed the
young one, although I have seen the hen on the edge of the nest with live
food in her bill.
On 20 July the youngster was seen perched on the edge of the nest.
On 23 July it left the nest completely and after this for a week it darted
for cover every time I went near the flight. On 30 July I was able to
watch it for the first time without it flying for cover. It was pale buff
with fine streaking on the face and underside, and huffish-brown with
darker streaking on the back. It had a pale buff throat, moustache-
streak and eye-ring; showing none of the colour of the adults.
At the time of writing in early September the young one is fully indepen-
dent and well.

According to the 94th Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society
of South Australia 25 species of Parrots were hatched and raised in the
Adelaide Zoo last year. Especially notable among them were 2 Musk
Lorikeets, 2 Rock and 3 Hooded Parrakeets and 2 Red-tailed Black,
4 Leadbeater's and 2 Slender-billed Cockatoos.

Unfortunately, the Red Shining Parrakeet hatched earlier this year at
the San Diego Zoo has died but, according to Dr. Jim Dolan, the Blue-
crowned Lories are progressing very well.

The pair of Iris Lorikeets belonging to R. Kyme hatched a chick in
July which progressed well until it was about 30 days old when it died.
This species has not been raised in Europe but has on several occasions
in the San Diego Zoo. Several other breedings with a more successful
outcome have occurred in Mr. Kyme's aviaries and this year his birds
have produced 4 Stanley and 3 Mealy Rosella, 3 Splendid, 1 Turquoisine
and 1 Yellow Redrump Parrakeets in addition to 4 Azara Conures. His
collection has recently been supplemented by several species of rare
Lories and Lorikeets and the aviaries are now inhabited by pairs in
perfect condition of such rarities as Duyvenbode's, Dusky and Yellow-
streaked Lories and Iris, Meyer's and Fair Lorikeets.

Although two members of the genus Charmosyna were bred successfully
just before the First World War by Brook in Scotland, the stock died out
and the possibility of ever seeing again specimens of these glorious
Lorikeets in our aviaries appeared very remote. A few Stella's Lori-
keets were imported privately in the 1930's and went to the collection of
the late A. Ezra at Foxwarren Park where they flourished but did not
breed. Except for these, it is unlikely that any other specimens of the
genus appeared in this country for 50 years. It was a big avicultural
event, therefore, when a private importer succeeded recently in obtaining
a single specimen of the Papuan Lorikeet which is now reported to be
thriving in the collection of Raymond Sawyer. Even more exciting was
the acquisition by the same enterprising importer of more than 20 Fair
or Fairy Lorikeets (C. pulchelld) all of which arrived in excellent con-
dition. This tiny, colourful species, about the length of a Budgerigar

Bedford would have described as an " exquisite psittacine gem ". Let us
hope that the unique opportunity not only to emulate Brook's success
but also to establish an aviary breeding strain will not be wasted.

When I first joined the Avicultural Society, almost 30 years ago, one
of the most regular contributors to the magazine was Dr. Alan Lendon.
Almost every species of Australian parrakeet bred successfully in his
aviaries, and I remember well his series of articles in the magazine which
ultimately were published in book form. More recently he wrote about
the Golden-Shouldered Parrakeet, the Cloncurry Parrakeet and the
Blue-cheeked Rosella all of which he did much to establish as aviary
strains in Australia. He is not only an ardent aviculturist but also a
very keen bird watcher and his accounts of birds in the wild, some of
which have also appeared in the Avicultural Magazine, have made
fascinating reading. For years I have wanted to meet Dr. Lendon but
my ambition was fulfilled only recently when I visited Adelaide early
this year. The few days which I spent mainly in his company represent
a highlight of my avicultural career. Together we visited some of the
parrot collections in the vicinity of Adelaide and spent several hours
watching the host of species of waterfowl which thrive on the South
Australian salt pans. I shall write about the species we saw on another
occasion, but the most exciting to me were White-backed Wrens and my,
first Grass Parrakeets in the wild, a pair of Elegants. Dr. Lendon is
still a practising aviculturist but he has reduced the size of his collection
considerably and now keeps pairs of rare species like Golden-shouldered,
Hooded and Orange-bellied Parrakeets as well as Leadbeatter's Cockatoos
and a breeding colony of African Grey Parrots.

After an excellent dinner, Dr. Delacour presented the President's Medal
to Mr. Walter Van den bergh in recognition of his outstanding services
in the cause of aviculture
In making the presentation, Dr. Delacour spoke of his memories of the
Antwerp Zoo which he first visited as a boy in the early 1900's and of how
the Gardens had suffered in the two world wars. Under the directorship
of Mr. Walter Van den bergh, the Gardens and the Collection had been
transformed to their present excellence. Dr. Delacour also spoke of the
work done by Mr. Van den bergh and his colleagues in the breeding of
the Congo Peacock and the reconstitution of the Imperial Pheasant from
the single living specimen available to him, the latter species now being
almost certainly extinct in its native Indo-China, and of the achievements
at Planckendael, the Antwerp Zoo's country estate where many species
of birds are bred. It was for Mr. Van den bergh's outstanding contribu-
tion to aviculture that he was being presented with the President's Medal,
only the fourth to be awarded in the long history of the Society.
In reply, Mr. Van den bergh expressed his deep appreciation on behalf
of himself and his colleagues for the honour bestowed on him.

Members assembled at 12.30 for sherry which gave a rare opportunity
for southern and northern Members to meet each other. After a
delicious luncheon, Mr. Mottershead and Mr. W. Timmis, Curator, took
the party on a fascinating tour of the Zoo.
There was so much to admire in the beautifully landscaped and planted
gardens, the well-designed buildings which were both functional and
attractive, and the many rarities amongst the exhibits, that it would be
hard to single out the most enjoyable feature, but probably the magnificent
Tropical House held the Members' interest for longest.
The time passed far too quickly and after meeting again for tea at
5.0 p.m., Members with long journeys reluctantly had to leave.
I am sure that all Members would wish to thank Mr. Mottershead and
his staff most sincerely for their warm hospitality and for giving the
Society such an interesting and enjoyable day.

PIGEON RACING. By H. R. Axelrod and E. C. Welty Jr. London:
The Oak Tree Press, 1973. Price #2.50.
As a boy I kept and flew Racing Pigeons for my own amusement.
During part of the war I was in the Middle East Pigeon Service, an
organisation which gave me a great deal of time to watch Racing Pigeons.
I have, however, never indulged in the competitive sport of pigeon racing
so it must be understood that I am only qualified to review this book as
an ornithologist and pigeon-addict, not as one directly involved in the
sport in question.
The book starts off with a refreshing lack of false modesty: " Just follow
my suggestions . . . compare them with any other advice you have been
given. I am sure you will have little trouble in being consistently among
the top winners The pigeon racer's love for his birds is emphasised;
much in the book makes it clear that this love is conditional upon the birds
performing as their owner dictates and desires. This being so, it is
perhaps as well that the statement (p. 10) that " . . . the pigeon loves
Man ..." is demonstrably untrue as a generalisation even though it may
be valid for a few individual pigeons.

Information on the keeping, breeding, training and flying of Racing
Pigeons is given in detail. In spite of this being, as we are assured,
based on personal experience, it often reads surprisingly like a compilation.
It is, for example, surprising that anyone who has looked closely at,
let alone handled, a blue chequer (the commonest colour pattern in Racing
Pigeons) can write (p. 83): " A checker occurs when a pigeon's basic colour
is covered with small feathers of a darker shade--". Some other state-
ments also seem questionable or at least not applicable to all Racing Pigeons,
for example, that " very little attention is paid to the first egg " (p. 56).
The widowhood system is fully explained. The section on this should
be of thought-provoking interest for all students of bird behaviour,
especially any who doubt whether birds feel emotions as strong, illogical,
and easily manipulated by the unscrupulous as our own. The book is
very fully illustrated with sketches, diagrams and a large number of
excellent photographs. These latter include adult Racing Pigeons of
almost every colour pattern, young of varying ages, and a few fancy breeds.

TANAGER DISPLAY
Last year I promised a note on the sexual behaviour of a pair of Paradise Tanagers,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9213619375" page_id="56811653"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
Tangara chilensis. In June 1972 I one day observed the male of a pair appearing
from a hawthorn bush with a bamboo-leaf carried crosswise in the bill. He landed
at the side of the female with the feathers ruffled, the wings drooped and shivering,
and beak and tail pointed upwards. This happened several times during the
period of observation. Each time he entered the bush on one side and emerged
at the same place on the other side, uttering a " si-si-si-si-si " call in a falling
cadence. He reminded me to a high degree of the Cordon Bleu, Uraeginthus
bengalus. I was unfortunately in hospital a few days later, but on returning a
month later I again saw the same behaviour once or twice, before the pair were
killed by some other inmates.
Once I have seen a male Golden-eared Tanager, Tangara chrysotis, crouched
feathered to a shelf, raising the ear-coverts in a similar manner to those of the
Violet-eared Hummingbird, Colibri coruscans, and giving the head a somewhat
snake-like appearance. This was the only occasion on which I observed this
behaviour.

WARBLER, Cichladusa guttata, AT BIRDLAND
By L. W. Hill (Bourton-on-the-Water, Glos., England)
Birdland possessed one Spotted Morning Warbler: and in 1971 a second
one was purchased, which, after a period of re-adjustment under the care
of John Midwinter, who is excellent in these matters, was put into my
Tropical House where it very fortunately proved to make a pair. The
Tropical House is well-vegetated and maintained at a temperature of
about 70 degrees Farenheit.
After a few months it was noticed that the birds were trying to make
small piles of mud on the Palm Tree leaves. It was hardly believable that
this was nest-building, but both birds were very busy at their objective.
One day in 1972 a small mud nest was observed on top of a small girder.
It was approximately 3 \ ins. high and the bird was sitting on it. The
nest resembled a minute Flamingo's nest except for the lining of plant
material. Eggs were laid and a chick hatched.
Full success was achieved early in 1973. On 23 rd April both birds were
frantically building a nest on the same small girder. On 26th April the
hen was sitting on the nest, probably all day. It was assumed that the
first egg had been laid. On nth May there was a young one in the nest,
being fed with mealworms and maggots; and on 24th May it left the nest
and was really airborne in the next two days.
Since then the birds have nested several times and single young again
been reared.
As described above, the Spotted Morning Warbler, Cichladusa guttata
has been bred at Birdland, Bourton-On The Water. It is believed this
may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in
Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once
with the Assistant Editor.

By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancs., England)
The Spotted Morning Warbler, sometimes known as the Spotted
Morning Thrush, is a small thrush-like bird, of six and a half inches. Its
upper parts area dull rufous brown with a creamy-buff eye stripe, whilst
below is also creamy buff, heavily marked, with large black spots. The
tail is cinnamon. There are three species of Morning Warbler all
confined to Africa. The Spotted Morning Warbler is found in the southern
parts of the Sudan spreading southwards through Ethiopia, Uganda and
Kenya down to central Tanzania.
They are comparatively rare in captivity, possibly due to the fact that
they are not one of the more brightly coloured species which a lot of
people seem to prefer, although in a quiet sort of a way they are very
attractive birds and have an extremely pleasant song. This is usually
heard in the early morning and late evening. The sexes are more or
less alike, but the cock appears to have larger spots than the hen.
We have kept this species in Winged World for a number of years and
have found them extremely easy to cater foi; their requirements being
a good soft food mixture and live food such as maggots and mealworms.
Our original two birds built a number of nests over quite a long period of
time. These were made mainly with mud, mixed with the odd piece of
dried grass or rootlets and shaped into a deep cup approximately four
inches across overall, perfectly rounded, and about three inches deep, the
mud being nearly half an inch thick. These were invariably built on the
top of a vertical branch with a minimum width of three inches, where the
higher portion had been broken off leaving a rough finish.
They laid two pale greenish-blue eggs and incubated for twelve days
plus, they then left the nest which ultimately collapsed. As mentioned
above, this happened on a number of occasions, it wasn't until we found
four eggs in one nest that we realised that we had two hens. We then
attempted to obtain two more birds, with the idea that out of four birds we
would have a better chance of getting a true pair.
Our two new acquisitions arrived in September 1972 and as one of them
was more heavily spotted than the other we thought that we could have a
true pair with these birds, and consequently released them both into one
of our planted compartments.
Within a month they had started carrying mud up into a rubber tree
and were attempting to fix it onto a sloping branch, with hopeless results.
We then decided to help by fastening a piece of plastic netting horizontally,
near to where they were trying to build. They did construct a nest onto
this, but that too was unsuccessful.

A wicker nest-basket was then fixed up earlier this year close to the
plastic mesh and some mud was pressed into the bottom and sides to give
them a little encouragement. This they readily accepted and ultimately
laid their eggs in, without very much more nest building. They incubated
for approximately twelve days. It is impossible to be more accurate, as
the necessity of placing the nest in a secure place also made it difficult
to obtain good visibility owing to the foliage around it.
The chicks duly hatched, one was found on the floor beneath the nest
at an approximate age of two days, the other one leaving the nest fifteen
days from the assumed time of hatching. In colouring the young bird
resembles its parents, but is considerably smaller. Even so, it was
flying quite strongly on first leaving the nest on 1 st July.

(Empidornis semipartilus)
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (St. Keverne, Cornwall, England)
This very attractive, graceful and unusual Flycatcher is not often
imported into this country and I have not seen others than those we have
obtained ourselves direct from Roberts Wildlife of Lake Baringo, western
Kenya. There are three races, the nominate race from northern Ethiopia
where it is stated to be common in dry thorn country, havirondensis which
ranges from South-east Sudan, Uganda, the western half of Kenya to
north Tanzania and the third race orleansi which ranges over parts of
western, central and southern Sudan into western Ethiopia. The
nominate race is said to be slightly darker above than the other two races
and the wings and tails of havirondensis are longer than either of the other
two races. We believe that some of the Silver Birds we have imported
have been havirondensis and possibly two of them orleansi. The adults
vary in length from a little under 7 ins. to ins and in colour are a
silvery grey above with the primary feathers dark grey. Below they are a
deep tawny. Both sexes are alike.
Our experience has been that Silver Birds are more sociable among
themselves than any other flycatchers we have kept. Even in the breeding
season we have had three of these adult birds in one aviary and though
there was some chasing there was no fighting. They are not to be
trusted in a mixed aviary with smaller birds. There is no territory song
but both sexes have a low and sweet song and call which is most
distinctive.
In June 1966 we imported a pair of Silver Birds with their own

youngster which was still in juvenile plumage. We housed them in a
planted aviary with a flight 9 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft. and a shelter 6 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft.
high. Though all three birds appeared to be in excellent condition
within a month the hen started to spit and sneeze and quickly died. A
postmortem showed respiratory parasites. The cock developed the same
symptoms but after a few days in a hospital-cage and with a veterinary
surgeon prescribing thiabendazole dusted on its mealworms for a week
it seemed to recover, but not for long as it died later that summer. The
young bird never developed the parasite and is still in perfect condition
now, seven years later. The next problem was to get a mate for our
unsexed bird still in juvenile plumage and it was not until May 1969 that
we were successful. From the behaviour of the two birds in the aviary
we felt sure we had a true pair, the new arrival, being slightly deeper in
colour below, broader and a little longer, was a male and our three year
old bird a hen. Within a few days the latter started building a nest in an
open-fronted nest-box in the shelter. According to the " African
Handbook of Birds " Vol. 2 by C. W. Mackworth-Praed and Captain
G. H. B. Grant, from which book we have also obtained most of our
information on the nesting behaviour, range and races of the species in
their natural surroundings which is mostly open acacia bush, the nominate
race appears invariably to breed in old weaver nests, usually those of the
White-headed Buffalo Weaver Dinemellia dinemelli. The other two races
either build a large nest of dry grass with a roof of thorny twigs or use the
nest of other species particularly those of the larger Weavers.
By the 13th June our 1966 hen had cleared up all the dried grasses and
loosely twisted string or cord which we tease out and supply as a nesting
material to many of our birds. The nest-box was soon filled to over-
flowing with an untidy mass of material and bore little resemblance to a
nest. On the 22nd June it seemed that she was making no progress so
we fixed up another nest-box in the flight--this time with an entrance
hole. She quickly switched to this box but was intimidated by a cock
Tacazzi Sunbird, one of a pair nesting in the adjacent aviary, and soon
returned to her shelter nest-box. We then moved the nest-box from the
flight to the shelter to give her the choice of the two but she still preferred
the open-fronted one. On 1st July another pair of Silver Birds arrived
from Kenya. They were in perfect condition but as I was so sure that
we already had a true pair I let a friend of ours have the new arrivals.
Throughout the summer nest building continued but the hen seemed
unable to finish it off. It almost filled the nest-box by now, with the
entrance high up. The grasses and teased string all seemed to be laid
in one direction and not woven in any way. Feathers and other nesting
materials were ignored. We were convinced by this time that this
particular bird was incapable of building a nest to her satisfaction and was
probably descended from a long line of Silver Birds which use discarded
Weaver nests so we sent to Kenya for such a nest! When it arrived we

placed it inside another open-fronted nest box which it almost filled--but
the hen never took a look at it though we watched for hours over many days.
In June 1970 the hen commenced nesting again in the open-fronted
box in the shelter after the two birds had wintered together in the same
aviary. She spent most of her time in the nest, sometimes remaining
in it when I came into the shelter to feed. At intervals I checked the
nest but no eggs were laid. She seemed to prefer long lengths of the
teased-out string or cord and threw out all the short lengths she had used
earlier. As last year she remained unsatisfied with the result and so
passed another frustrating summer for the birds and ourselves! In
September our aviaries were dismantled and in October we moved to
Cornwall with the Silver Birds, other softbills and some nectivores. Both
birds spent the winter in cages in the bird room at our new home until an
aviary was ready for them. Early in the Spring of 1971 the male Silver
Bird died. It had been ailing for some time and though separately caged
from the hen, it had never really settled down since our move. The 1966
hen was placed in its new aviary with two Ant Thrushes which are ground
birds, while we awaited the arrival of two more Silver Birds from Kenya.
Though without a mate that summer she nested continuously in an
open-fronted nest-box in the flight.
The two new Silver Birds arrived on 31st August 1971 and seemed a
pair. It was a bit late in the year to try and acclimatise them in the
same aviary as the 1966 hen so after a short period in a cage together we
transferred them to a small aviary with a heated shelter and let them out
on fine days only for the next eight months. All three birds called to
each other frequently.
On 21st April 1972 we transferred the Ant Thrushes to another aviary
and replaced them by the two 1971 Silver Birds, shutting the three birds
in the shelter each night and releasing them to the flight each morning.
The three birds agreed and no fighting took place. Two food pots were
supplied always. The flight is 21 ft. long by 6 ft. wide and is 6 ft. 6 ins.
high. The shelter measures 6 ft. x 4 ft. x 7 ft. 6 ins. high and is a compart-
ment of our birdroom which we keep at a minimum of 45*F in the winter.
The open-fronted nest-box of \ in. wood measures inside 5 ins. wide,
6J ins. deep 4 J ins. high in front and 5! ins. high at the back, is placed
just outside the shelter window about 6 ft. from the ground and facing
west. It is at the north end of the flight and is under a flat roof which
covers the flight for about 4 ft. of its length. This flat roof gives the nest-
box cover from rain and direct sunshine. The aviary runs from south
to north and is heavily planted. There are two hydrangeas, a 4 ft.high
hedge of Lonicera nitida about 10 ft. long, two fuchsias, two small black
alders, a eucalyptus tree up to the roof and which requires much pruning,
a veronica and a few spirea which are grouped around the nest-box area
and give it some privacy. Outside the flight on the west side are three
more eucalyptus trees about 5 ft. or 6 ft. high and several alder about 10 ft.

to 12 ft. in height. On the north side there is a small wood of deciduous
trees which screens the avaries from a road which is busy in summer and
helps to break the cold spring winds we seem to get. All this is ideal
cover yet the flight receives ample sunshine from the south and west.
Other nesting-boxes were erected but no interest was shown in them as
the old hen again resumed nesting in her old box.
At first it meant shutting the birds in the shelter each night as the
spring was cold until the middle of May, particularly at night. As in the
past, the 1966 hen had a busy summer, building and rebuilding her nest
and sitting in it for days at a time except when she fed. No eggs were laid.
The 1971 pair gave her a wide berth but made no attempt to nest them-
selves. About this time we had started breeding locusts and these became
a part of the daily diet. They were readily taken, mostly by the cock. So
another summer and winter passed, the three birds in the flight by day
from October to March and in the shelter at night.
In March 1973 when it came to the nightly job of shutting the birds in
the shelter, the 1971 hen became more and more reluctant to enter so for
her own safety we caught her up and caged her and now hoped the old hen
and the 1971 cock would pair and breed. On June 1st no progress had
been made so we rather sadly came to the conclusion she would have to be
removed from the aviary and caged. We replaced her by the 1971 hen.
During the next few days there was some wild chasing of the hen by the
male--up and down the flight for minutes at a time following which they 1
would perch together. Though we never saw them mate, we did feel
they were compatible. The question was, would the hen be capable of
completing a nest or would she behave like the 1966 hen? We had not
long to wait; on 8th June just eight days after we had transferred her to
the aviary, there was a well finished and domed nest in the same nest-box
plus one egg! The entrance hole was at the top and the materials were I
the same, teased out string or cord and some raffia.
The weather was now very hot for this part of Cornwall, about 73 *F.
Incubation continued normally and when I checked the nest on the 22nd
June there were three eggs, one more than is normal in Africa. At
10 a.m. on the 23rd June I saw an eggshell fragment near the water pot
about 18 ft. from the nest. This was the 16th day since the first egg was
laid and 14 days since incubation had started. From then on we gave
mealworms ad lib . (instead of about 10 each twice daily, with a similar
quantity of maggots plus insectivorous food which they will eat very well
if they are rationed with live food). The weather was again very hot,
74*F, with almost unbroken sunshine. The nest-box under the flat roof
must have been many degrees hotter so it was not suprising that the hen
did not brood as much as one would expect. However we had the
consolation of seeing her taking mealworms to the nest several times and
saw both birds hawking for insects in and around the bushes. Whenever
we have to give mealworms in quantity, which is usually when young birds

are in the nest, we always coat the mealworms with vegetable cooking oil
and dust them just as lightly with " Vionate" vitamin/mineral additive.
Either must not be done too freely or the mealworms become limp and
the birds wont feed them. The next day we saw some livefood being
carried to the nest, but in the afternoon both birds were perched together
for long periods. It was again hot. Partly from curiosity and partly from
our need to know how many chicks we were catering for (mealworms
can be in short supply just when you need them and one requires a
stock for safety), we shut the parents in the shelter and covered the window
with newspapers while we checked the nest. There was one chick and
two unhatched eggs which we left.
During the next few days the weather was cooler and more time was
spent by the hen brooding. Only mealworms and locusts were fed by both
parents, maggots were untouched. On the ist July we observed the male
kill a third instar locust and take it straight to the nest, the hen flying out
as he arrived. The male then went in to feed. The door-framing at the
end of the flight furthest from the nest was by now plastered with excreta
sacs deposited by the male. The hen dropped the sacs she carried into
the larger hydrangea. By this time we were supplying about i J ozs. of
mealworms and about 25 locusts a day. On the 6th July, the 14th day
after hatching, both parents were observed for over an hour during the
afternoon but were not seen to take food to the nest, so with the parents in
the shelter and its window covered, I carefully put my hand in the nest-box
and felt a silky, fully-fledged bird which seemed to fill the whole of the
nest. Earlier in the day we had seen the mother carrying nesting material,
hence our doubts. Live food usage started to drop and as the days went
by without the young bird leaving the nest we began to wonder if all was
well. On the 12th July I checked the nest again and again touched a
warm silky bird.
The next morning at 7 a.m., the 21st day after hatching, a young
robin-like bird was seen in the flight. It was spotted buff with darkish
flecks on the head underparts and back. The tail, about S in. long, was
dull grey as were the wings. No second fledgling was found though we
searched the flight from end to end. It was on a high perch at 2 p.m. and
at 7 p.m. we shut it in the shelter with its parents just to be safe! There
was only one unhatched egg (instead of the expected two) in the nest, so
another search of the flight was made. We then let the cock out for a
while knowing he would feed it if there was one, but he only fed himself.
The egg, which I broke getting it out of the nest, is a pale shade of green
with a light brown mottling mostly at the large end.
Next day was cool, 58*F maximum, and very wet, but the parents saw
to it that the young bird stayed under the covered section of the flight and
did not get wet. As the weather got worse in the afternoon we shut all
three birds in the shelter and were able to observe it being fed with
mealworms by both parents. The locusts were too large by this time,

but even so, the adult birds broke them up and swallowed them
themselves--about eight, (fourth instar), went during the afternoon
The next three days were warm and included a two-hour thunderstorm
from which all three birds sheltered. The hen was now rebuilding her
nest and on the 19th July one egg was laid. The male parent was now
doing most of the feeding and with a second clutch in the offing we dare
not cut down on the mealworms in case they ceased to feed the young bird
which was now flying strongly but as yet unable to feed itself. From the
20th July we stopped shutting the three birds in the shelter at night. The
next day there were two eggs and a third on the 23 rd July when the hen
started incubating. The young bird had grown a lot and was very
active. While the hen incubated the male did the feeding until the 28th
July when we noticed she kept coming from the nest to feed the gaping
youngster which the male was now ignoring. It was now time to separate
the young bird, which we did at 6 p.m. and caged it well away from the
hearing of its parents. It ate only a few mealworms up to 10 p.m., three
from 5.30 a.m. next morning to 10 a.m. and 30 mealworms from 10 a.m.
to 1 p.m.. From then on it was no trouble and within two days we had it
eating the usual insectivorous mixture plus eight mealworms three times
daily.
On the 4th August an eggshell was found in the flight, the 13th day
after we thought incubation had started. I checked the nest on the 10th
August and felt one chick and two eggs so it looked as if the other two
eggs had been chilled as a result of interrupted incubation. On the
22nd August the fledgling left the nest, the 19th day after hatching. We
did not shut the young bird or the parents in the shelter this time and
noted that it returned to its nest many times and we believe it roosted
there at night with the mother. On the 1st September there were two
cold eggs in the nest and the hen commenced incubation on the 3rd
September. We separated the young bird on the 5th September, the
15th day after leaving the nest. It was feeding itself within two hours.
We checked the nest on the 15th September. There were three eggs
again. One chick hatched on the 17th September, 15 days after we thought
incubation had started. A second chick hatched later possibly next day
and the pattern of feeding followed as for the previous clutches. After
the hot summer we were now in a spell of storms and cold nights with
night temperatures on occasion as low as 40*F. However two Silver
Birds left the nest during a mild spell on 6th October the 20th day after
the first chick hatched. It does seem that the extremes of weather made
little difference to the incubation periods of 13 to 15 days and in the time
to leave the nest, 19 to 21 days. I think supplying locusts gave some
variety to the live food, mostly mealworms, and helped a lot in rearing
these birds. With the latest two birds we did not shut them in the
shelter until two days ago (nth October) when cold easterly gales and
heavy rain compelled us to.

The Silver Bird hatched on the 23rd June is now moulting in an indoor
flight in our birdroom. It still has some feathers to come but the spots
have gone and the underparts are the same deep tawny as its parents.
Also, like its parents, it is grey above with dark grey primary feathers.
The Silver Bird hatched on the 4th August is now half patchy grey on the
head and back replacing some of the fawn spots. It is still spotted fawn
beneath but tawny feathers are spreading from the vent area. It is
6 ins in length. The tail feathers are dull grey and the primaries a dull
dark grey. All four young birds are in fine condition.
Last year we ordered another Silver Bird to try and make up two pairs.
It arrived from Kenya about two months ago. We think it is a male and
it has been caged with the old 1966 hen ever since. They agree perfectly.
Next year we hope to give her another chance to breed in an aviary with
her new companion.
As described above, the Silver Bird, Empidornis semipartitus , has been
bred by Mrs. K. M. Scamell. It is believed this may be a first success.

BREEDING THE RUBY-THROATED OR
BLACK-CRESTED BULBUL, Pycnonotus melanicterus
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.991281842105263" page_id="56811669"  page_num="189" year="" vol="">
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (St. Keverne, Cornwall, England)
For some years when we lived in Newdigate, Surrey and since in
Cornwall, we have kept in our aviaries a few Bulbuls of the species
Pyconotus melanicterus. Sometimes the birds are advertised for sale by
dealers, but generally they have been difficult to purchase in this country.
Some of these Bulbuls have had small raised crests, others have been
crestless or almost so. One feature those we have kept had in common,
was a ruby or red coloured throat.
The earliest importation into the U.K. of the Ruby-throated Bulbul
was believed to be in 1904 and the aviculturist who kept them, Reginald
Phillips, reports his experiences with the two birds in Avicult. Mag.
(2)7(1908-9) : 215-219 : 236-240. I am also indebted to Dr. Colin
Harrison for clarifying the present grouping of the various races of these
Bulbuls and I cannot do better than to quote from a recent letter he
sent me in reply to my enquiry on the matter:--
" The taxonomy of the bulbul is rather complex. All forms are now
grouped as the species Pyconotus melanicterus, which is given the name
Black-crested Bulbul, probably a better one in view of the variation in
throat colour. There is a yellow-throated, non-crested form in Ceylon,

and a yellow-throated crested form in Borneo. There is a red-throated
crestless form in South-West India, a red-throated crested form in
Eastern Thailand, and a red-throated orange-breasted form in Java
(dispar). The remaining forms are black-throated and the crest is
developed to varying degrees. At present 12 races are recognised by
name ".
Our Ruby-throated Bulbuls measure about 7 in. in length. The head,
nape and beak are black. The back, wings and tail are dark olive-green
and the underparts pale yellow. The legs are brownish and the throat
feathers, some of which tuft or bristle, are a deep red or ruby colour
which fades somewhat in captivity. The iris is yellowish. The call ;
sometimes has a single note and at other times a pleasing bubbly one of
many notes. There is no territorial song.
We have found them reasonably hardy once established, although in
winter it is essential to provide a minimum temperature of 45*F in the
shelter. Feeding is simple--an insectivorous mixture (we make our own)
into which we grate carrot and apple until it is nicely moistened. We
then add soaked currants, cut-up soaked sultanas and cut-up figs and
grapes. All the fruits are well dusted with Gevral-Protein. Maggots
are not eaten and at times mealworms are also ignored or just a few taken.
We have tried small locusts but these have been left also. During breeding
periods mealworms are sometimes taken in quantity.
We purchased our first pair of Ruby-throated Bulbuls in 1964. From
what country any of this species came from we have never been able to
find out. This particular pair were of one of the crested races but it
was not until 1966 that they showed any interest in nesting. As this came
to nothing we moved them to a larger aviary planted with bamboo
rhododendrum and privet. It measured 20 ft. in length, 4 ft. in width
and 6 ft. 6 ins. in height, with a shelter measuring 4 ft. x 2 ft. x 7 ft. high
and this they had to themselves. In May 1966 they were again seen
carrying dried grasses to an open-fronted nest-box placed high up near
the roof of the flight and concealed somewhat by privet, On 3rd June a
broken egg was found in the shelter and after about 10 days a check
showed an incomplete nest in the nest-box as in the previous year. As
the nest-box was on the large size we squeezed inside it a part of a disused
thrush's nest and inside that was placed an old warbler's nest. On the
25th June two eggs had been laid in this improvised nest. Then followed
normal incubation by, we think, the hen (the sexes are alike). Both
eggs hatched on 8th or 9th July. We gave mealworms in addition to the
usual food and the mealworms were seen to be fed by one of the parents
perching on the ledge of the open front. It was easy to shut the parents
in the shelter and check the nest and this we did every other day. The
weather was very hot. We tried extra fruit such as diced pear. The
mealworms taken were very few, perhaps 30 per day but much of the
fruit was taken. We wondered if they were getting other live food such

as caterpillars as the aviary was on the fringe of our wood. Both young
birds left the nest on the 20th July, the 12th or 13th day after hatching.
The fledglings were very attractive with dull black caps, white gapes,
olive green mantles, and dark olive-green wings, and were creamy under-
neath. They were quite small with tails about 1 in. long. They perched
in the privet and were able to fly short distances only. About 12 meal-
worms were taken that day but the next day over 50 mealworms went.
We had gone through a very warm spell, temperatures being generally in
the high seventies or low eighties F., and the inevitable thunder-
storm broke on the late afternoon of the 22nd July. Searching in the
aviary we found one young bird beaten to the ground and dead. We shut
the survivor and its parents in the shelter. Next morning it seemed
very fit and perched high and as the weather had now cleared up we let
the three birds in the flight but shut them in the shelter for the next two
nights. On the 25th July I didn't like the look of the young bird, it
was very hunched and stayed in the shelter so we shut the parents in with
it. It was not being fed so nothing could be done except to put it into a
hospital cage and try to hand-feed it. However it died in a few hours and
from the colour of its droppings it was apparant that it had enteritis.
The parents soon began nesting again, incubation commencing on the
3rd August and one chick hatching out on the 17th August. Another egg
remained unhatched. Feeding was as before but three days later a dead
chick was seen in the flight. The old nest-box was removed and replaced
by a new and smaller one. The Bulbuls took to this at once, completing
a small cup shaped nest, and were incubating two eggs by the end of the
month. These hatched on the 12th September. Again the food was as
before and the parents birds were both seen feeding. Again the chicks
were thrown out, this time five days after hatching.
The male parent died the following April, but we managed to purchase
another bird (sex unknown) later that year. This bird however, was
crestless and its yellow colouring was paler. Early in 1970 I had the
misfortune to break a bone in my right knee and this resulted in some
stiffness in the joint and made it difficult for me to climb the staircase in
our house so we decided to move to a bungalow in an area where the winters
were milder and the summers not quite so hot. Later that summer we
purchased a property in Cornwall close to the sea. Though we are much
more exposed to winds and storms than we were at Newdigate, our
avairies are all protected from South-Westerly winds by high screens of
evergreens such as Escallonia, Eucalyptus etc.. We moved here in
October 1970 with about 50 softbills and nectivores and with our. best
aviaries in sections! It took the next 12 months to erect and plant the
20 aviaries we now have, so 1971 was a blank year for any successful
breedings. The old crested hen died in 1972, but we were fortunate in
obtaining three more of the uncrested form, two from a dealer both
freshly imported) and one from a Zoo (acclimatised). We now had the

possibility of two pairs but it was too late in the summer of 1972 to expect
any nesting in the aviary we gave them. This has a flight 12 ft. long
x 3 ft. wide by 6 ft. 6 ins. high and a heated (45*F minimum) shelter
3 ft. x 3 ft. x 7 ft. 6 ins. high at one end. It is planted with a griselinia, a
conifer and furthest from the shelter a Lonicera nitida and a Senecio.
Three of the birds spent the winter in this aviary and all seemed to agree,
at least until the Spring. The fourth looked miserable and was caged in
the birdroom. In the shelter was an open-fronted nest-box and a felt-lined
canary nest-basket, in the flight an open-fronted nest-box. On the
24th April 1973 one of the three Bulbuls was seen in the nest basket and
on checking this I found one egg. A second egg was laid the next day.
Incubation continued until the 5th May when one egg was seen on the
floor. The other egg was in the nest but punctured. The eggs measured
22 mm x 15 mm. They were dark brown at the broad end with an off-
white background flecked brown at the pointed end. By this time we had
removed one of the three Bulbuls as it was being chased from the food
pots. It was placed in a nearby aviary to join No. 4 which had over-
wintered in a cage. In late May one of the first pair was seen carrying
dried grasses to the Lonicera nitida bush which was then about 4 ft. high
and in which was built a very small cup-shaped nest entirely of dried
grasses. Two eggs were laid and as the nest was entirely exposed to all
the elements a sheet of clear corrugated plastic was fitted to the roof
netting frame. Two chicks were hatched on the 14th June and the
incubation period was either 13 or 14 days. We supplied the usual food
plus about 50 mealworms most of which could have been eaten by the
parents. All the mealworms were very lightly coated with vegetable
cooking oil and as lightly dusted with Squibbs " Vionate " a mineral-
vitamin supplement. Within three days we were feeding 100 mealworms
a day. The weather was warm but unsettled on the 19th June when, with
the parents in the shelter, I had a look in the nest. Both chicks were
growing well and were heavily quilled. Another warm spell followed--
where we live the shade temperature so far has not exceeded the low
seventies F., but with the intense sunshine it always seems warmer
than similar shade temperatures in Surrey. By the 23rd June, the 10th
day after hatching, the chicks were almost fledged. Mealworm con-
sumption had dropped from a high of 150 per day to about 100. Early on
the 25th June, the 12th or 13th day after hatching, both fledglings left
the nest. It was raining at 11 a.m. and as we were going out for the day,
we shut the parents in the shelter, caught the young birds and put them
in the shelter also. On our return in the evening they were on a low
perch and from the droppings we were satisfied they were being fed. We
kept the four birds in the shelter until the 29th June. At night all four
would be on the topmost perch, the two young in the middle and one
parent either side, a pretty sight! Other food was now being taken in
addition to about 100 mealworms per day. The young birds differed

from those bred in 1967 from " crested " parents in that their underparts
were whitish and not creamy-yellow. They could fly fairly strongly in
and out of the shelter, but at night we shut the shelter door. They were by
then invariably perched inside close together like peas in a pod. Observa-
tions over a period of an hour on the 3rd July showed that both parents were
still feeding them mostly mealworms. From now on we rationed the
mealworms so that they had none for four or five hours a day. This
pushed up the consumption of the other foods. The white gapes were
disappearing, the birds grew very fast and were almost as large as their
parents by the 9th July. On the 16th July, the 22nd day after they had
left the nest we shut the parents in the shelter and carefully caught the
young birds and caged them some distance away. They were feeding
themselves within two hours, eating all the soaked currants first. Though
they were offered mealworms strangely enough they didn't touch them,
and only after they were moved to an indoor aviary in the birdroom
about two weeks later, did they sometimes steal one from a flycatcher
sharing the same aviary.
The parents took the separation of their youngsters very badly, looked
very miserable for some days and then moulted some of their tail feathers.
We didn't expect that they would nest again this summer but by the middle
of August the hen was incubating two eggs in a new nest about 18 ins.
above the old one and in new growth. It was a few inches from the top of
the shrub and even more exposed to the weather than the first nest. On
the 30th August one chick hatched the other egg remaining unhatched.
I removed this egg in about 10 days. All went well until the 12th
September when the young bird should have left the nest. It seemed
not quite fledged and slept a lot. We could see it through the netting
from the path. Its breathing was very rapid and though the parent
brooded the bird almost continuously, mealworm demand had dropped to
very little and we formed the opinion the bird had been chilled on the
nest during the night which had been cool. Two days later it was found
in the flight dead. As I mentioned earlier, the nest is a very frail affair
measuring about 3! ins. across, 2 ins. in total depth and less than J in.
thick. Its not lined, just coarse dried grasses. For success it seems it
needs two chicks in the nest and warm days and nights such as we had in
June and July. The two young birds which are independant have yet to
moult but they have gradually become pale yellow underneath. The ruby
or red throat is as yet absent though a deeper yellow than the underparts.
The second adult " pair " have not nested.
As described above, the Black-crested Bulbul, Pycnonotus melanicterus,
has been bred by Mrs. K. M. Scamell. It is believed this may be a first
success.

in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at

(Trachyphonus erythrocephalus)
By M. D. England (Neatishead, Norfolk, England)
The genus Trachyphonus , the so-called " ground barbets ", is confined
to Africa south of the Sahara and consists of five species--D'Arnaud's,
Yellow-breasted, Red and Yellow, Levaillant's and the Yellow-billed--
the last of which is sufficiently different for it to be placed by some
authorities in a genus of its own, Trachylaemus. The first three are
birds of dry scrub areas and thorn savannas, while the last two prefer
more wooded country.
The Red and Yellow Barbet lives up to its name and is a brightly-
coloured bird clad mainly in red, yellow and black. The body is basically
yellow, with black mantle and wings which are heavily spotted with
white; it has red cheeks connected by a red band passing over the rear of
the crown, a good deal of red on the upper breast and ventral areas,
white cheek-spots and a tail which is barred black and white. The
feathers of the crown are erectile. The male differs from the female in
being generally brighter in colour and in having a black fore-crown and
throat patches; both have a variable black and white breast-band. The
species is locally resident from Somaliland and Kenya to north-eastern
Tanzania; it is common in some parts of the Northern Frontier province
of Kenya.
My Red and Yellow Barbets were sent to me from Kenya under licence
by Tim Barnley and received at his hands the same meticulous attention
and care in packing as he appears to give to all his birds, with the result
that they arrived in perfect condition. They were placed in a section of
birdroom about 6 ft x 5 ft. by 8 ft. high, with access to a 20 ft. flight.
Because of very poor April weather they were kept inside for the first
week or so, but seemed so fit that they were soon allowed into the flight.
A nest-box ioins. x ioins. x 7 ins. was provided and they immediately took
to roosting in it. From the start they returned to the shelter each night
of their own accord and needed none of the wearisome chasing indoors
which so many birds require. On the other hand they rarely go inside
during the day except to feed, however bad the weather.
I have never known birds to thrive on so little food. They were offered
mealworms, maggots, locusts, soft food, and fruit of many kinds, with
occasional grated cheese and egg-yolk. At first everything was ignored
except mealworms, but they settled down to a diet of a few of these,
a fastidious peck at the soft food and diced fruit, with one or two maggots
when they had finished their mealworms. Of course they are never
denied food, but they appear to need incredibly little.
These birds are well-known as duettists, and almost immediately after
arrival they started their interesting and amusing performance of sitting

side by side, beaks slightly up-tilted, ecstatically " shouting " (this really
is the only appropriate word) at each other an unmusical cackle. It is
initiated by one bird but taken up at once by the other, in different tempo:
while oneissinging "titti-poo-too" the other keepsup "chock-er-chock-er".
Most of the time they face each other, but as the paroxism proceeds they
rotate their heads to and fro, looking remarkably like the mechanical
singing bird which provides the " signature tune " to the television
programme " Going for a Song This song is subject to considerable
variation, since it is sometimes performed by a party of birds in chorus
and the duet sung by one pair of birds may be very different from that of
another pair. The song of my pair, for example, is quite unlike that of
the pair which may be seen and heard in Alan Roots' magnificent film
" The Baobab Tree ".
They pose an avicultural problem since they are normally bank-nesters,
boring a hole in earth or sand or termite-nest, like a kingfisher, and the
particular aviary in which they were housed was quite unsuitable for the
building of artificial banks such as are provided at, for example, " Winged
World ". As a substitute a bale of tightly compressed peat was set up
with a tunnel and partially-excavated nest-chamber. To prevent the
roof falling in, an upper lining of black plastazote was fitted. In case this
was not to their liking, five different types of nest-box were hung in various
positions; two were given a cursory inspection, but otherwise all were
ignored.
Their song continued for the rest of the year and through the winter
but in early spring was performed less and less enthusiastically and very
infrequently. It was noticeable too that no longer did they perch side by
side but one would sing in the flight and be answered by the other in the
shelter. They seemed to be losing interest in each other and certainly
showed no inclination to breed.
About mid-March the song ceased altogether, which made it all the
more surprising to see, on the last day of March, the male pecking the
female's head, then strutting in front of her, head and tail raised, and
attempting to mate with her. However, it seemed to be a solitary effort
and they settled down once more to ignoring each other, one sitting in the
flight, the other remaining in the shelter.
On 7th April I was amazed to see the female leave one of the nest-boxes
in the shelter, whereupon the male immediately flew up and took her
place inside. He remained there for as long as it took me to feed the
birds in all the sections of the bird-room and it was obvious that their
apparent indifference was a cloak for serious nesting operations.
Both birds incubated the eggs, the male taking a major share during the
daytime. Since I am not sure when it started, I do not know the length
of the incubation time, but by 17th April the nest undoubtedly contained
young because the parents were taking turns at carrying mealworms up.
They were good parents, feeding the young at frequent intervals with

food carried in the bill. Mealworms were taken whole but mandibulated
to soften them; small locusts had all legs removed and full-grown ones
had their wings torn off before being given to the young. The method of
doing this was interesting and similar to that adopted by hoopoes and
some other birds; the locust was taken down to the ground, seized by the
leg or wing and violently shaken until the body came off, sometimes being
thrown right across the shelter with the effort. It would then be grasped
by another leg or wing and the process repeated until the body was
devoid of appendages, when it was held longitudinally in the bill and
carried to the nest in that position. On the other hand, mealworms were
held transversely.
By 7th April a youngster was looking out of the hole and two days
later it was out, to be followed by the second (there were only two) in
another couple of days. They were immediately sexable as male and
female, being smaller and slightly paler editions of their parents, one
having the male's characteristic black crown and throat marks.
Both parents continued to feed them well, at first on the ground and
later when they perched. Curiously enough, although they ate them,
the young were not very keen on the locusts which their parents always
chose to offer them when they were available; the youngsters obviously
preferred mealworms to everything else. The first out did very well for
a week, when it began to decline and eventually succumbed at five or six
weeks old. The young male rapidly became self-supporting and had to
be removed to another aviary when his parents showed signs of starting
another nest.
To make the record more complete it should be added that, prior to
their second brood, a great deal more courtship was seen. The male
frequently fed his mate, sometimes stealing a locust which she was
preparing to eat in order to offer it to her. There was much head-pecking
as they perched side by side, although again their duetting ceased.
Mating was seen twice with little preliminary while perched, but the male
usually prefaced an attempt at coition by strutting round the female on
the ground, tail cocked up, with increasingly frenzied head-pecking until
as she crouched low he stood astride her , feet on the ground , until he actually
mounted and grasped her as the act was completed. He looked comically
like a tall man whose feet reached the ground while riding a small pony.

THE DWARF (RED) TURTLE DOVE
[Streptopelia tranquebarica)
By S. B. Kendall (Chertsey, Surrey, England)
As its English names suggest, Streptopelia tranquebarica is a member of
the large group of " ring-necked " doves of which the domesticated
Barbary Streptopelia roseogrisea and Collared dove, Streptopelia decaocta ,
are well known examples. It is however much smaller than either of
these, being only about nine inches long and is probably unique in the
group in having a well-marked colour difference between cock and hen.
Cocks have an ash-grey head down to a black collar round the hind
neck. The rest of the upper plumage is wine-red except for a dark grey
patch at the base of the tail. Wings and central tail feathers are brownish
but the three outer pairs of tail feathers are black at the base and white at
the ends. The lower parts are mainly wine-red. Hens are brown-grey
with a black collar similar to that of the cock. Young when they leave the
nest are uniformly brown without a black collar but this soon starts to
appear. Cocks moult into red plumage in the autumn or winter of the
year in which they are hatched, i.e. the first moult, the exact time depen-
ding on whether they are early or late hatched. If young cocks are
examined in early autumn a few red feathers may be apparent.
According to Whistler (1941) the bird has a wide distribution throughout
Asia and parts of China to the Philippines and there are three recognized
races of which the one from Assam and Burma is most richly coloured.
My original stock probably came from India but more recently I bought a
pair in which the hen was distinctly darker. The cock with which she
arrived was certainly of excellent colour but this does vary between
individuals and according to age in my home-bred birds. However these
may well have been the Burmese race.
The Red Turtle Dove has been known to Aviculture for a good many
years and a Miss Rosie Alderson (1913) who was an enthusiastic and
successful dove-keeper wrote a laudatory account of " this beautiful little
dove, very small, trim and graceful in shape " in the Avicultural
Magazine, the articles being later reprinted in a volume called Practical
Bird-keeping which was edited by J. Lewis Bonhote. Miss Alderson
refers to the birds nesting freely but not always rearing. I have not traced
the reference but I believe that elsewhere she does report successful
rearing. There are probably earlier references.
I have now kept the Red Dove for about 13 years, breeding successfully
nearly every year and now having a well-established stock. Some
account of the birds' activities may be of interest to fellow Members of
the Society.
I have never seen the species in the wild but Whistler (loc. cit.) gives a
useful account from which it appears that it is less conspicuous than the

other common doves of India occurring usually in single pairs, away
from villages but in all sorts of country except extreme desert and heavy
forest. Occasionally large flocks occur and these may consist of all males.
Importation into Britain is sporadic. I remember seeing what were
described as " Burmese Red Doves " advertised in Cage-Birds soon after
the war when importation was just being resumed and I was thinking
about resuming bird-keeping, but it was not till later that I bought four
pairs (probably from India) as a breeding nucleus. There were the usual
troubles with imported birds. All four cocks died from ornithosis, one
hen succumbed to some other cause and as no more imports appeared I
was left for a year or two with three widows. However I was eventually j
able to exchange one hen for a cock and to buy another. These birds
provided the nucleus for a stock which, while fluctuating widely over the
years, has with one infusion of fresh blood survived to the present day.
As has been indicated the species has the outstanding merit of being
readily sexed on colour. Old hens tend to look pinker than is typical,
particularly on the breast, and some cocks are less red than others but the
distinction is usually very clear. In captivity flocks of mixed sex can be
kept together outside the breeding season but when breeding, as with most
doves and indeed with most birds, they do best as isolated pairs. I have had
limited breeding success with a small flock (three or four hens with rather
more cocks) in a shed and attached flight with a total floor area of about
twenty-four square metres but the occasional bird is liable to be persecuted.
In a confined space unacceptable persecution may take place. I have
recently had two pairs breeding very successfully in a total floor space of
ten square metres but one pair established territory outside and the other
inside the shelter. There was no evidence of persistent fighting. Young
birds were tolerated, but were removed within two or three weeks of
leaving the nest.
Red Doves build for preference in an open site although I have had
them nest in a covered box. The nest is initially of the classic dove
type--two crossed sticks on which the eggs are balanced. I usually try
to persuade them to nest on a piece of half-inch wire mesh or to replace
the nest they build with one of netting. With luck, however, the birds
nest more than once and the nest may be used again and become more
substantial as the season progresses, partly as the result of the accumula-
tion of droppings.
The normal clutch is two eggs. Whistler ( loc . cit.) says that three
may occur. I once fostered a spare egg to make a clutch of three all of
which hatched, but one young bird died after a few days. Young doves
normally orientate themselves in the nest in head-to-tail fashion and when
three were present there were clearly complications, and, it seemed to me,
unusual activity while they tried to arrange themselves suitably. Barbary
Doves are capable of hatching and rearing Red Doves in spite of the latter
being so much smaller, but in my limited experience there is a high

percentage of failure.
The incubation period is about thirteen days and the young grow very
rapidly; particularly, so it appears, for the first week. At about ten days
there is a tendency for babies to hop out of the nest. This should be
avoided if possible by leaving them strictly alone. If a bird should leave
at this stage, or even wander a little from the nest platform it will probably
not be brooded and will die unless put back. Brooding is shared between
cock and hen in usual pigeon fashion, the hen taking the night shift.
Young leave the nest at about fifteen days after hatching and are self-
supporting soon afterwards. My records on this are not exact. Birds
do not interfere with rings put on after fledging.
A pair that starts breeding in May, which seems to be the norm in
southern England may well rear three broods in the season but there are
of course plenty of opportunities for accidents. Birds live and continue
breeding for a number of years and a three or four year old hen is probably
a better breeding proposition than a first year one.
My birds have unheated sheds to roost in and appear to be completely
winter-hardy. Feeding is easy. They seem to accept most grains up to
the size of the components of "mixed chicken corn" i.e. a mixture of
wheat, cracked maize, oats and barley, the two former being much
preferred. A commercial " canary mixture " is much enjoyed. Clearly
cereal mixtures may prove inadequate for breeding although doves seem
less susceptible to the deleterious effects of low protein than some species.
I feed turkey starter crumbs with the cereal mixture and sometimes
bread and milk and hard boiled egg but it is difficult to say how much
they take.
To me S. tranquebarica is a very delightful bird and a very satisfactory
aviary subject. A drawback, which has been more apparent to others who
have kept the species than to myself is its typical dove-like tendency to
panic when disturbed. Birds in a confined space may fly directly at the
disturber and escapes can occur. In a larger area they may hit the end
of the flight uncomfortably hard and damaged heads and wings result.
However, if treated gently in quarters to which they are accustomed their
nervousness can be overcome.
The need to establish in captivity and regularly to breed foreign birds
in order to avoid dependence on continual importation is a fashionable
doctrine with unfortunately more advocates than exponents.
The Red Dove seems to be a very suitable subject for ultimate domestica-
tion.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
Although I am unaware of any hummingbird species which indulge in
mutual preening, after studying these birds for a number of years, I have
learnt it is unwise to generalize with this family, as the Trochilidae are so
diverse, there is almost sure to be a species which will prove any generaliza-
tion to be incorrect.
It is safe to assume the majority of hummingbirds do not indulge in
mutual preening, and because of this have evolved highly developed
scratching and preening postures. To the casual observer, the minute
legs and feet (of most species) would appear to be of little use other than
for gripping a perch. However, if one is prepared to study these birds
more closely, it will be seen how well adapted for preening the feet have
become.
As with most birds which do not (or are unable due to being housed
alone) indulge in mutual preening, the hummingbirds preen the head,
neck, chin and upper throat with their claws. Long billed species preen
certain other parts of the body also in this way.
The Swordbilled Hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera ), due to the extreme
length of beak, is unable to reach any part of its anatomy other than the
wings and tail, and even these feathers can only be run through the centre
of the beak as a whole, not individually as with other hummingbirds.
Because of the length of beak and the problems entailed, the legs and feet
of the Swordbilled have extra manoeuvrability, thus enabling the species
to preen areas it could not otherwise reach.
It is quite an experience to watch a Swordbilled bathe and preen and
the first time I witnessed such an occurrence, I was amazed as to how well
the bird's legs and feet are adapted for such work. As far as I am aware,
no other species of hummingbird is able to preen the centre of the back
or vent feathers with its claws as the Swordbilled does.
A friend informed me that a Swordbilled owned by him was seen to
preen the primaries also with its claws. Certain hermits ( Phaethornis
and Glaucis) will preen their wing coverts with their claws, but I have yet
to witness a hummingbird preening its primaries in this way.
Several other species, due to the length of beak, have to use their claws
a great deal. Many of the hermits (both Phaethornis and Glaucis) can be
seen to scratch-preen regularly; in fact, a female Long-tailed Hermit
(P. superciliosus) in my collection often scratch-preens areas which can be
reached just as easily with the beak.
It is often stated that in common with most other birds, the humming-
birds bring the foot up and over the wing when scratching. As with most

generalizations appertaining to this family, this one is incorrect. I will
agree it is more usual for most hummingbirds species to bring the foot up
and over the wing. However in many long-billed species the foot is brought
up and under as often as it is brought up and over.
Due to the way in which they are constructed, many hummingbirds
assume most exaggerated preening postures. The neck appears to be
exceptionally flexible and when certain species preen the wing butts or
the upper (and lower, according to the length of beak) breast, the neck
may be stretched to three or four times its usual length. The neck is also
stretched during certain scratching postures and I have a number of
most amusing colour transparencies showing a female Blue-fronted
Lancebill ( Doryferajohannae ), with the neck stretched out of all proportion
while scratch-preening the lower hind neck.
I have mentioned the unique way in which the Swordbilled Humming-
bird preens. Another species which has an extremely specialized beak
is the Sicklebill ( Eutoxeres ). This species, however, appears to find little
difficulty when preening, in fact the beak proves to be an ideal tool for
such work, and it is only the head, hind neck, chin and upper throat which
has to be scratch-preened. Due to the extreme curvature of the beak,
the Sicklebill does not have to assume exaggerated postures when preening
the lower throat and upper breast.
I believe it is possible to place certain scratching and preening attitudes
into categories. First there is the posture taken up by a hummingbird
which is scratching due to irritation. Under these circumstances the
actions although deliberate are usually rapid, the foot being moved
extremely quickly. If the irritation is about the head, the bird will while
scratching move the head into different positions, thus enabling a larger
area to be covered with the minimum of effort. I have noticed that this
form of scratching is quickly over and it appears once the irritation has
eased, the bird wil cease to scratch.
When scratch-preening, the foot is moved in a more leisurely manner
and the bird gives the impression of actually combing the feathers with the
claws. Also during scratch-preening the bird's body will often move in
unison with the action of the foot; especially when it is the neck feathers
which are being preened. It is a most amusing sight to see a number of
hummers sitting on the same perch all scratch-preening, as if the perch is a
supple one, the movement of the birds sets it in motion until eventually
such a momentum is reached, the birds find difficulty gripping the perch.
Scratching and scratch-preening is often carried out on the wing and
certain hummingbird species appear to prefer to scratch and/or preen
while on the wing rather than when perched, even though such an activity
appears extremely difficult to human eyes. With irritation scratching, it is
usually the head or beak which is attended to, and a male White-bellied
Woodstar (Acestrura mulsani ) in my collection, will purposely leave the
perch to scratch its head and/or beak.

202 A. J. MOBBS--SCRATCHING AND PREENING POSTURES IN HUMMINGBIRDS
When scratch-preening on the wing, it is usually the breast or abdomen
which is attended to, although I have on occasions witnessed humming-
birds scratch-preening the hind neck also. To do this, the foot is usually
brought up and over the wing; no mean feat when the bird remains
airborne the whole time.
Finally I would like to mention displacement preening in hummingbirds.
This occurs when a bird has experienced stress for some reason, and is
most prevalent directly after fighting has occurred. It can also occur
directly after a bird has been forced to leave a favourite perch--either by
another bird or by a human. I have also witnessed displacement preening
by a bird which has acted in a way which in human terms would be
considered foolish: i.e. miscalculated when alighting on a perch.
Displacement preening appears to be carried out by the claws (even in
short-billed species), and as with irritation scratching, is carried out in a
rapid manner. However, an aviculturist who has witnessed this activity
a number of times should be able to distinguish it from irritation scratching
or scratch-preening as the bird's movements will be more jerky and the
head in particular will be moved more sharply.
I have witnessed displacement activity in certain species yet rarely if
ever in others. Pufflegged (Eriocnemis) and Sunangels ( Heliangelus ) appear
to indulge in this activity more than most, probably because of their
extremely aggressive nature. The Rufous-breasted Hermit ( G . hirsuta ),
also reverts to this activity regularly.
It appears as well as certain species indulging in displacement preening
more than others, individuals from these species may acquire mannerisms
peculiar to themselves, but not necessarily to the species as a whole.
For example the male Rufous-breasted Hermit in my collection scratches
the lower hind neck--usually after showing aggression to other species
with which it is housed. When perched this hermit brings the foot up
and over the wing or up and under, but when the displacement scratching
is carried out on the wing (which is often) the foot is always brought up
and under.
The male Tourmaline Sunangel ( H . exortis) in my collection, also
scratches the lower hind neck; this bird always brings the foot up and
over the wing. The Sapphire-vented PufHeg ( E . luciani), although not as
consistent as the two previously mentioned species, does scratch the hind
neck, but will also scratch the crown during displacement activity.
Displacement scratching and/or preening is known in many other
families of birds and I have witnessed the activity in numerous parrot-like
species, also in domestic pigeons.

By Karl-L. Schuchmann (Zoologisches Institut, Frankfurt, Germany)
During a research study at San Pedro, California, on certain ethological
aspects of North American Hummingbirds, I was, with the assistance of
S. Wells and G. Nixon, able to trap a young albino Black-chinned
Hummingbird, Archilochus alexandri.
During the early part of July 1972, approximately 15 female A. alexandri,
were seen to be brooding, or showing signs of nesting, in the restricted
area of Averill Park, San Pedro. The nesting sites were close to a small
lake and many of the nests were directly above the water. The breeding
birds preferred the shrubs of Senecio petasites --a plant belonging to the
sunflower family-- and lower parts of certain willow species.
I first saw the albino Black-chinned in the lower pait of an elm tree at
a height of about three metres. I had been informed by other observers
that the bird had left the nest three days before. Up to this date, the
mother bird had fed the young albino regularly every ten minutes or so.
There had been two youngsters--the other being a normal coloured
bird--but 24 hours after leaving the nest, this bird was not seen again.
As well as feeding the young albino, the mother hummingbird collected
nesting material (hair, spiders' webs and for the external decoration
dead cactus cells), and proceeded to build a second nest in an elm some
two metres from the previous nest, in which the albino had been raised.
The female Black-chinned laid her first egg the same day as the second
nest was completed; two days later, the second egg was laid. By this time
the young albino had left the nest six days.
The albino had remained in the same elm since leaving the nest. As
the mother bird was now sitting, she was unable to feed the young bird
regularly and because of this, the latter was heard to call for food more
persistently. The call was made up of a high pitched ziip. Sometimes
the call would be answered by the mother bird and she would then leave
the nest and feed the youngster. However, it was noticeable that as time
progressed, the begging behaviour of the young albino became less
successful.
Other hummingbirds (mainly immature A. alexandri and Selasphorus s.
sasin) were seen to attack the young albino; these attacks were usually
warded off by the mother bird.
Seven days after leaving the nest, the albino was caught with a butterfly
net. Permission for this was granted by the United States Department
of the Interior Wildlife Service.
From the time of fledging, the albino had been most lethargic and was
not seen to inspect leaves or flower buds; an activity observed in other
hummingbirds of the same age. Before the bird was collected, it was

Distributed in various subspecies over the southern third of Africa, our
three specimens (&lt;J? 9 ) came from the vicinity of Luanda in Angola on
the 20th May 1971. They appear to be the nominate form Pternistes a.
afer , Muller 1776.
Description
About the size of a Partridge with the spurred male being noticeably
larger than the female, they have the forehead, eyebrow and moustachial
stripe white, top of the head brown, neck speckled black and white and
the remainder of the upper parts earth-brown with darker shaft stripes.
Underparts are broadly streaked with black and white (black shaft stripes
with white edges) legs, bill, facial skin and throat wattle coral red. The
sound most commonly heard from our birds is a loud " crowing cackle ",
on a descending scale, usually heard early morning and late afternoon.
They are reputed to make " Kek Kek Kek " call in flight, and give their
alarm call when perched in trees.
Accommodation and Diet
After quarantine the birds were released into a small aviary approxi-
mately 4 ft. x 10 ft. x 7 ft. high, with a shelter 3 ft. deep at the rear. The

For convenience the birds were kept as a trio, though almost certainly
only one hen was mated with, and certainly only one was favoured, being
called to mealworms and other choice titbits by the male. If the other
female approached she was given a sharp peck and swiftly chased away,
although not pursued. The greater part of their day seemed to be spent
skulking amongst the small shrubs of their aviary, the male being particu-
larly lethargic. Great interest was taken in the fresh turves which they
regularly received, the presence of the odd female being tolerated at the
investigation. Dust-bathing was also taken part in regularly and
vigorously, the birds resting periodically during their exertions. The
only form of courtship observed was after the supply of mealworms or
turves, when the male called to the female with his neck stretched up and
forward, all plumage apart from the flank feathers which were fluffed out
was sleeked, and he adopted a peculiar high stepping gait around the
apparently disinterested, feeding female. The stretched neck of course
showed off the naked red throat patch very clearly and the stripes of the
underparts were shown to advantage by the upward stretching of the bird.
Mating was never observed. The first egg was laid on the 25th January
1972, eight months after the birds' arrival; this, however, was broken.
The first clutch of five eggs was started on the 19th March 1972, eggs
being laid on alternate days. A sixth egg was laid on the 4th April. Of
these two were infertile and four were dead in shell. The size of the eggs
varied from 31-34 x 38-40 mm and possessed remarkably thick shells.
They were a uniform light brown colour and heavily pitted--each pit
showing as a white speckle. Egg production started again on the 7th
December 1972 continuing very erratically throughout the first four
months of 1973. Forty-four eggs in all were produced of which four
only hatched on the 21st May after an incubation period of 23 days.
Of the remainder six were dead in shell, three were broken and the others
were infertile.
Chick Development
On hatching the chicks' down pattern was as follows: a mid-brown
stripe bordered by darker brown extended over the crown to the nape.
The back was mid-brown bordered by darker brown next to a buff stripe,
a dark stripe separating this from the buff undersides. The face and

(Sicalis flaveola)
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
In the early spring of 1973 I received three South American birds of the
genus Sicalis from Robin Restall in Spain. From their behaviour I
suspected that they were two males and a female but there was some doubt
about their specific identity. An examination of museum skins showed
that they must be Saffron Finches, Sicalis luteola. This species had been
bred fairly frequently in captivity but, like many other South American
species, its behaviour and life-history are very poorly documented and
the present account seemed justified.
Plumage
The adults of the species are distinctive enough. The male is green
above with faint darker streaking on the lower back and dark inner webs
on tail and wing feathers; yellow on head and underside; with saffron-
orange on lores, forehead and forecrown forming a distinctive patch.
The amount of green tint in the yellow on the underside, head and mantle
seems to vary with age. The male described here, newly moulted from
immature plumage, showed a distinct green tint over much of this plumage.
The female is olive-green dorsally, with dark streaking on mantle and
back, and small fine streaks over the head. Wings and tail are dark with
of greenish-yellow feather edges. Lores, throat and underside are yellow
and the area around the eye is an unmarked yellowish-green. There may
be a faint orange tint on the forehead.
The identification problem arose because the birds sent, although
behaving like adults, were in immature plumage. This is greyish-white
on throat and underside, save for the upper breast which has a broad band
greenish-yellow, the latter continuing as a narrow strip across the upper
mantle. The head is grey, slightly tinted buff and with fine dark streaking
over the top and nape. The mantle and back are streaked dark brown
and tinted yellowish-green, deepest on the rump. Wings and tail are

dark, edged with greenish-yellow like those of the female. The under
tail coverts are yellow. The bill of adults is a light buff colour. In
the young it is blackish at first, but the lower mandible becomes pale, and
is conspicuous in " bill-up " displays.,
In this plumage the birds were singing advertisement song and
quarrelling, and one received like this was still in immature plumage six
months later. The period for which this plumage is retained, and its
relationship to the breeding cycle does not seem to have been investigated.
General Behaviour
The Saffron Finch is a typical seed-eating bunting, appearing rather
heavily-built and short-necked, and having a short blunt bill. It perches
when resting but feeds extensively on the ground, walking with a steady,
lark-like stride, and occasionally running. On a perch it will sidle rather
than hop. It can cling to a vertical perch and lean out to reach seed-heads.
It is capable of making brief, flycatcher-like flights from a perch after
small flies. It bathes avidly.
Saffron Finches are aggressive and quarrelsome, both among themselves
and with other birds, tending to dominate those placed in aviaries with
them. This makes them difficult for mixed aviaries and this, together
with their loud and rather monotonous song, probably prejudices avi-
culturists against them.
Food
I can say little concerning food, since the birds were housed with some
Painted Quail and for much of the time also with a pair of Spanish
Sparrows also present. An aviary seed mixture was offered and maggots
and grated cheese were also put into the aviary. The last two regularly
disappeared but I could not be sure if the Saffron Finches took any. They
certainly took unripe seeds of grasses and herbaceous plants, and small
insects, especially when there were young in the nest, but were not seen
to take maggots or mealworms until the young of later broods were in the
nest.
Voice
The normal flight call is a " chep " note, sparrow-like but a little more
melodious. Birds settling near each other may squabble with a harsher
" chuc-chuc-chuc " chattering note, usually accompanied to some extent
by the " bill-up " display. A subdued " hueet " call was heard at times
from the male, usually when the female was on the nest, and from its
context it appeared to indicate slight anxiety. The alarm call, frequently
heard, is a short, high-pitched and thin " stit ".
Advertisement song is usually uttered from a high and conspicuous
song-perch. Although in brief moments of song during other activities
only four or five notes may be uttered in a phrase, during more sustained
</bodyText>

C. J. O. HARRISON--BEHAVIOUR AND BREEDING OF SAFFRON FINCH 209
outbursts the phrases consists of eight to twenty notes. The notes
resemble the high-pitched calls made by House Sparrows during their
more excited moments when fighting, but are a little more melodious.
In a typical phrase the first four to seven notes are loud, sharp and incisive,
and are uttered separately as a series of independent notes with apparently
random variation in pitch. The remainder of the phrase is similar but
the notes are more hurried, less sharp, and sometimes two or three are
run together. As a song it is monotonous and the cumulative effect is not
melodious.
There are usually periods of sustained song, one long phrase following
another in rapid succession, after dawn and just before sunset. The early
morning song period may be very long. The period at dusk may be
shorter, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but is of very regular
occurrence, even in cold and wet weather. During the breeding period
there are intermittent outbursts at other times of day and short phrases
may occur at any time.
In addition the male also has a subdued song. This is a quieter,
sustained warbling of a much more musical type. It is uttered as a
continuous flow of soft and melodious but slightly wheezy notes, and may
include intermittent low, grating notes. It appears usually to be sung
in the presence of the female, and on the only occasion on which an
apparent courtship display occurred it was accompanied by this song.
The call of young in the nest is a soft wheezy " tzee-tzee "; and on
their emergence this changes to a loud " zwit, zwit-it ", harsh, nasal and
of moderate pitch, lower than the call of the nestlings.

Postures and Displays
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999703388888889" page_id="56811695"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
In general the green and yellow colouring of the adult birds is less
conspicuous than might be expected, but the orange forehead of the male
appears to have a strong signal function. During advertisement song the
head is frequently moved from side to side and up and down as the
disjointed notes are uttered, and the frequent sharp movement of this
small patch of colour is conspicuous from a distance.
A possible epigamic display was witnessed only once and not clearly
seen. The male was feeding on the ground near the female. A more
vigorous burst of the subdued song was heard and the male was briefly
glimpsed running towards the female, rather upright, the feathers of head
and neck appearing fluffed so that the orange and yellow colour was very
conspicuous. The wings appeared to be drooped and the tail cocked
sharply upwards.
The aggressive nature of this species has already been mentioned.
Reaction to other species such as the sparrows was a simple forward
threat with open bill. Towards conspecifics the " bill-up " threat posture
was frequently used. One bird would settle near another, in a rather
upright posture either facing the other bird or laterally aligned to it, and

throw back the head with a quick movement so that the bill pointed
straight upwards. Both birds may adopt this posture and one may make
a threatening move towards the other, but in general dominance appears
to be established without open conflict.
In the male the colouring of the forepart of the head which moves
most conspicuously during this display is yellow, with the orange forehead
region. In the female throat, lores and around the eyes are unmarked
yellow. In the young the throat is white, and the pale huffish lower
mandible is more conspicuous during the movement.
Breeding
When received, in late February, the birds were put into an aviary
consisting of a part of a greenhouse 2 ft. 6 in. x 4 ft. x 7 ft. high, set in the
angle of a wall with the top partly shaded, and opening through a large
aperture into a planted flight on a slope, about 13 ft. x 3 ft. and tapering
in height from 8 ft. to 5 ft. Two birds were in immature plumage and the
female had mostly moulted into first adult plumage. It was thought that
both immature birds sang from high perches in the flight. One was
scruffier, having lost many feathers on head and body, and the other was
dominant.
During the next two months the first moulted into adult plumage and
became the dominant bird, supplanting the other. The female was seen
occasionally carrying small twigs. According to the rather sparse litera-
ture the natural nests are in cavities. Rolls of wire-netting with long,
dead grasses woven into them were put up in the shelter, but the grasses
were pulled out and the site ignored. Boxes placed in the shelter also
aroused no obvious interest.
In early May a cardboard box with one end partly removed was fixed
at the end of a perch in the flight, under a section sheltered by a polythene
sheet. The adult-plumaged male sang perched by this box and the female
was seen to enter carrying grass blades. Since the Spanish Sparrows
were still present a nest was provided for them. This was a section of
silver birch log, about 10 in. long by 6 in. external diameter with walls
about J in. thick. It had been a tit nest-box and the usual round hole
near the top was enlarged up to the lid and the whole turned on one
side to provide a horizontal cavity with a slit-like entrance on the side at
one end. This was hung in an exposed position, on the wire side of the
flight, near the door and furthest from the shelter. The Saffron Finches
immediately transferred their attention to this. The male sang on top
of it or from a nearby perch, and chased off everything else. The Spanish
Sparrows went to Herbert Murray who already had a displaying male,
and the extra Saffron Finch, who was losing feathers in aggressive
encounters and tending to hide, was offered temporary asylum by Leslie
Ranee.
The singing male finch was seen to pick up fragments of nest material

and hold them once or twice, and in the early stages of nest building was
seen to carry material about, but it is not certain that he played any
significant part in nest-building. This was done by the female, rather
furtively, and a nest became partly visible within the box, at the end furthest
from the entrance. An examination later showed it to be a shallow cup
of dead leaves and stems and dried grass, lined with finer grasses and
feathers. It was so far in that nothing could be seen but by 24th May
there were eggs in the nest, the nearest just touchable with a finger-tip.
On the Spring Bank Holiday of 26th-28th I was able to observe the female
and saw her enter the nest once or twice, but no evidence of brooding.
As always the birds were nervous, the thin " tsit " note being constantly
heard, but they seemed tamer than previously.
On 7th June when I could feel a young one I realised that each time I or
a neighbour appeared in our gardens the male gave the alarm note and the
female immediately slipped off the nest and joined him. In view of the
amount of time she must have been off the nest it was fortunate that we
were enjoying an exceptionally prolonged period of fine hot weather.
Incubation must presumably have begun about 24th May. They were
more tolerant of birds than humans, for the perch by the nest extended
into an adjacent compartment with an Azure-winged Magpie in it, and the
constant flights of the latter jogged the nest a little with each movement.
Incubation, like building, appeared to be by the female alone.
With the hatching of the young the adults began systematically
searching the vegetation of the flight for small insects, but showed little
interest in small blowfly maggots when these were offered, although larger
maggots were utilized later in the season when the third brood were in the
nest. Both adults fed the young. I threw quantities of seeding Forget-
me-not weeds infested with aphis into the flight and these were quickly
investigated. The young continued to survive, although as in incubation
the female left the nest when people were present and showed reluctance
to enter with food.
When the young were about six days old I opened the box and pulled
one out. It was virtually naked, dull purplish-pink in colour, with a
few tiny sparse down tufts on mid-back, one or two on the wings, and a
few on the crown of the head. The gape flanges were very pale yellow,
the mouth orange. An egg had rolled to the wrong end of the box and
was not incubated. It was typical of the species, pale pinkish white,
but heavily marked with large spots and specks in dark purplish-brown,
hiding much of the ground colour and forming a dense cap at the larger
end. There were two young.
On the morning of 22nd the first young one emerged onto the perch by
the nest where it sat until late afternoon. Its first flight was quite strong,
and it kept to the higher perches. The parents kept up a barrage of alarm
calls and when the Azure-winged Magpie in the next aviary showed
interest they both flew at it and landed on the wire near it in a manner

suggesting intention of attack. The second youngster emerged next
morning and also spent some hours on the perch before moving.
The harsh begging call of the young was heard fairly infrequently.
Within two days the hen anxiously inspected the nest-box after I had
examined it, and two days after that began to lay, three more eggs being
in the box by 29th June, and the last presumably laid on 30th June.
The hen showed similar behaviour to her previous incubation although
once or twice, on suddenly emerging from the house, I saw her slip out
of the nest. The young were fed mainly, perhaps entirely, by the male
now. At seven days I saw him occasionally repulse a food-begging
youngster, and by ten days they appeared to be feeding themselves,
although food-begging could be heard for up to a fortnight.
The second brood had hatched by the evening of 13th July. The parents
were again eager for any insects. On this occasion I had some mealworms,
and these were taken when offered. As on the previous occasion during
the nestling period the adults were seen taking unripe seeds from grasses
and weeds in the flight as well as insects. The young of this brood
emerged on 29th July, behaving in similar fashion to the first brood.
Four young emerged and fledged. The male chased young of the first
brood away from the nest-box both during and after occupation by the
second brood, but otherwise there was no aggressive interaction with
them.
Three days after the second brood emerged the nest had been partly
rebuilt, the walls being raised and the cup deepened. The first egg of a
third brood was laid on 7th August, young were hatched by 24th, and
emerged on 7th September. Five eggs were laid in this instance, and
four young hatched and fledged. The weather having turned cooler
the nest-box was removed.
Clutches laid were therefore of 3, 4 and 5 eggs; and young hatched and
fledged were 2, 4 and 4. Intervals between young leaving nest and the
next egg were 4 and 9 days. In the latter stages of the last brood the
broken end of the box by the entrance hole fell away and it was possible
to see the interior. Throughout the whole period there was complete
nest sanitation by the adults both within the nest and the box, and there
was no evidence at any time of faeces within the cavity, or immediately
below the entrance where they would have fallen if voided at the entrance.
During the period that the third brood were being raised there was some
evidence of occasional noisy calling suggestive of song from some of the
earlier young. Also during this period the third adult, which had
originally been suspected to be a male, and which was being kept elsewhere
with some Zebra Finches, indicated its true sex by laying an egg, similar
to that of the breeding female but more sparsely marked.
The present data suggest an incubation period of about 13 days, and a
fledging period of 15-16 days, followed by about 10 days dependence on
the adults. The fledging period seems a little long. It is a difficult
</bodyText>

factor to calculate in an aviary breeding since the ease with which the
adult can find food and rapidly bring it to the nest may decrease the
likelihood that hunger and desire to follow the adult in search of food
might help to trigger off the initial departure. From about 10 days
onwards the young in the nest seemed to react positively to interference
with the box, not by crouching but by huddling back into the darkest
corner of the nest and box, the front ones rearing up in the nest to do so.
It seems possible that this type of cavity nesting might create a situation
where the young could remain longer at the nest site, and be stronger,
more active and more successful in their subsequent fledging. They did
not appear at the entrance to the box during the days immediately prior
to departure as do more typical cavity-nesting birds, and the tendency to
emerge onto a nearby perch and to sit there quietly for a long period
before attempting to move may be correlated with a need for the emerging
youngster to become accustomed to entirely strange surroundings.
Although the period of dependence on the adults seems short, after the
last brood emerged and (the nest-box having been removed) the female
was present with the young, the food-begging call was heard at intervals
for almost four weeks, although this does not necessarily imply that feeding
occurred. It may be that when the female is not occupied with a new
brood she may be more tolerant of the sustained demands of the young
than is the male.

By G. Michael Flieg (St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.)
We first obtained specimens of Laysan Albatross (Diomedea immutabilis)
and Black-footed Albatross (Diomedea nigripes ) at the St. Louis Zoo on
24 March 1966. Six specimens of Laysan and three Black-foots were
received. These birds were collected after the breeding season was
completed and arrived thin and not unusually aggressive. Our initial
attempts at hand feeding were in vain. We then force-fed the birds Smelt
(Osmerus mordax) and squid supplemented with vitamin A and B complex
and salt tablets. Salt was given until the birds excreted salt from the
nasal gland as described by Frings (1959). After a period of two weeks
the birds began to hand-feed. The birds were individually marked with
coloured plastic bands for quick identification. Temperament varied
within the group. The Black-foots were the more aggressive whereas
the Laysan were semi-aggressive to docile. The dainty Laysans were
hand-fed by placing the fish alongside the mandible; when the beak was
opened, the fish was slid back into the gullet where it was swallowed whole.
The Black-foots hand-fed quite differently as the fish were snapped from
the hand when held at the end of the mandible and then worked to the

gullet. At this point the birds were taking up to 60 Smelt per day per
bird. We then switched to Herring (Clupea sp.) which was a much
handier size for hand feeding and does not contain thiaminase which
destroys thiamine. Occasional squid were given. The birds were hand
fed so that each bird's intake could be recorded and observations concer-
ning their individual behaviour could be noted. As albatross are aggressive
feeders they should be fed with care. The razor sharp beak and tearing
hook are formidable weapons. One keeper sustained a severe bite which
became badly infected resulting in a severe case of blood poisoning. The
birds were kept in two indoor cages 5x2 metres with access to an outdoor
cage, weather permitting. They were given a salt water solution for
drinking but were seldom observed ingesting it. Instead they preferred
to drink the fine spray of fresh water from a garden hose. By August
only three birds were alive and two succumbed before the end of the year;
the last Black-foot died in April 1967. The next group of Albatross
were received in January 1967, totalling seven Laysan and three Black-foot.
These arrived in poor condition, but were quite heavy as they were taken
near the beginning of the breeding season. They were very aggressive
and difficult to induce to feed. Even when force-fed they refused to keep
a single fish down. These birds died in a short time, but we obtained
some valuable information. Due to improper packing containers,
(cardboard containers were used) half of the birds shipped died in ship-
ment. We also learned that albatross can be overdosed with NaCl.
Our last shipment arrived in December 1969. Well ventilated shipping
containers were built, 100 x 30 x 30 cm, with a door on one end screened
with 6 cm hardware cloth for ventilation. The birds were never fed or
watered in shipment. Six birds, four Laysan and two Black-foots,
arrived in excellent condition. Again the birds were over-aggressive and
refused to eat. From our experiences thus far we feel that birds taken
after the breeding season respond well to our feeding attempts because
they are lean and hungry and when the birds arrive at this time the weather
is favourable for giving the birds access to the outdoors for at least a part
of the time.
All of the birds were promptly autopsied upon their deaths and the
following results were recorded. It was found that contrary to popular
belief the birds could be saturated with NaCl and three birds were lost
due to salt poisoning. Two birds were lost to Nutritional Secondary
Hyperparathyroidism, an imbalance of Calcium and Phosphorus.
Aspergillosis in the respiratory tract claimed the lives of some birds, and
the virus PPLO was responsible for two deaths.
The treatments administered as a result of diagnosis made through
observation or autopsy are as follows.
(1) A severe gastro-intestinal problem developed which caused the birds
to vomit all their food. This was diagnosed by autopsy as asper-
gillosis and was promptly cured in other birds with mystatin
(Mycostatin).

(2) PPLO virus was found on autopsy. The birds went down in the
legs and were listless. Frings (1969) lists this as a sodium deficiency
but this occurred when the birds' salt intake was maximum. An
oral cortisone (Azium) was administered along with a tetracyline
(250 mg Achromycin) twice daily.

Individual specimens of albatross have been kept in captivity for
considerable lengths of time. Washington, D.C. kept a single specimen
of Black-foot for almost nine years and a Laysan for over two. Brookfield
Zoo holds the record for the Galapagos Albatross (Diomedea irrorata) at
four years, four months. The oldest age in the wild established by
banding records is twenty-nine years for the Laysan and twenty-seven for
the Black-foot (Robbins 1961).

Recently I have had the opportunity to study the captive breeding
biology of the Germain's (Polyplectron germaini), Gray (Polyplectron
bicalcaratum) and Palawan ( Polyplectron emphanum ) Peacock Pheasants
while working as Curator of Birds--Truli D Faims, Haines City, Florida.
All three species were hatched and reared from eggs obtained from
seven pairs of Germaine, three pairs of Palawan and three pairs of Gray
of various ages. This study is meaningful because of the statistically
significant numbers of breeding pairs and data was accumulated on clutch
size and clutch intervals in various age birds as well as variations between
the three species. Notes were taken on behaviour of the breeding birds
and the chicks. I have outlined the procedure for hatching and rearing
as well as problems which may occur and their solutions. This account
will begin with detailed observations on each species and conclude with
general procedures for rearing peacock pheasants. The same procedures
may be used for the Roul Roul Partridge ( Rollulus roulroul).
Generally the Peacock Pheasants go to roost right after sundown.
It is at this time that laying hens can be spotted as they stay on the ground
rather than going to roost. The hens may appear puffy for a day or two
prior to laying. Peacock Pheasant eggs are creamy pink to white in
colour. The hen goes to roost after laying or may remain on the egg if
it laid when it is near dark. The nest is a simple scrape usually in a
corner of the pen or under vegetation. The Palawan may drop its eggs
at random. A comparison of the Breeding Data compiled on the three
species is shown in Table I.

Their pens can be entered carefully without exciting the birds. The
cock is bold and doesn't hesitate to display before an audience. This
species is the first to lay (Table I). The hen is broody and will protect
her second egg. If the eggs are removed, a hen will produce up to six
clutches. Yearling pairs are capable of breeding and of three young pairs
one produced fertile eggs, the other two did not lay.

The Germain's is the most shy and flighty. The display is rarely seen
and most birds are extremely nervous. The oldest hen produced one egg
clutches or in the instances where she laid two eggs they were four days
apart. All the young pairs laid but the fertility was very poor. Up to
six clutches can be produced by a single hen. The male Germaine
becomes quite nervous and vocal when the hen is ready to lay.
The Palawan is between the previous species in temperament. This
species displays readily but is a bit shyer than the Gray. The cock takes
two to three years to attain its full colour but is sexually mature during
the first breeding season. The eggs are 100% fertile even among the
year-old pairs. Before the hen lays, the cock becomes very irritable and
contrary to his nature is flighty.
Eggs of the peacock pheasants are not stored but set immediately as
fertility declines quickly. The eggs hatch in 20-21 days. They are
placed in the hatcher 2-4 days prior to hatching depending on the air
space in the egg. If the egg is dry and the air space large, it is placed
into the hatcher early. If the air cell is small, it is put later or allowed to
hatch in the incubator. Eggs are turned 45 degrees three times daily.
Temperature in the incubator 99J 0 F (37*5* C) and Humidity (Wet
Bulb) approximately 83* F (28* C). The chicks hatch about 24 hours
after pipping. The Palawan chick which is the strongest hatches immedi-
ately. The chicks are allowed to dry in the incubator. They are then
moved into a brooder box. The box used is 61 cm. x 61 cm. x 20 cm.
The box is ventilated on three sides. The solid side contains the light
bulb which is about four inches from the solid brooder floor. The
chicks are started with 100 watt bulb; maintaining the temperature at
about 93--95 0 F (35 0 C). Paper towels are used on the floor. Crumbles
of Purina Gamebird Startina and Trout Chow are sprinkled on it. Quart
jar waterers are used with marbles placed in the water to prevent drowning.
The chicks are started on mealworms; each chick receiving 1-2 worm?
three times daily from a forceps and are given water from a dropper until
they are observed drinking. When newly hatched chicks are introduced
to established ones they are placed inside a small circular cage 15 cm. in
diameter made of fine hardware cloth. The chick can move around in
the mobile cage until the others are used to him. The chicks of the three
species are similar in size but differ a bit in colouration and are readily
distinguishable to the trained eye. As many as 6-8 chicks can be reared
together if they are compatible. We were able to put three-day-old
Palawans with io-day-old Gray and Germain's. The Palawans even at
this age are very aggressive and become dominant in the peck order though
they are only half the size of the others. Grays on the other hand are
the most docile and ignore their cage mates. Male peacock pheasants
can be detected as early as three days of age as they display to their cage
mates. Germain's are the most difficult to raise and their individual
temperaments range from aggressive to docile. This also has to do with

the sex as males are more aggressive. All chicks are handled daily to
check the vent and weight. The vent must be kept clean or the birds
become constipated. If a bird is encountered with this condition, the
water should be treated with Cosa-Terramycin. If crooked toes develop,
the chicks can be given a 5 mg. tablet of Vitamin B 2 daily--broken into
small pieces and placed deep into the throat with a forceps. If the
condition is not remedied in 10 days, spread the toes in natural position
between masking tape. In another two weeks remove the tape and the
toes will be perfect. During this procedure continue using the B 2
religiously. Initially \ in. perches should be placed in the brooder.
Use dowel pins gradually increasing the diameter as the chick grows.
Chicks are kept in the brooder until they are nearly grown.
During this growing period the size of the light bulb must be decreased
gradually to 15 watt minimum and the marbles can be removed from the
waterer. Cleanliness must be maintained at all times. Paper towels
must be changed when necessary and the waterer changed and cleaned
daily. The young birds remain tame but fly out of the brooders when
they are opened. It is important, therefore, that the brooders be kept
in a room or building so that the chicks cannot escape. Mealworms fed
individually keep the birds tame. When grown, the birds are transferred
to roofed wire bottom cages with shelter in them. Groups of these
peacock pheasants can be then introduced together into a large cage and
can be kept together for months without problems. Of course, when the
breeding season begins fighting will occur and the birds must be separated
into pairs or pens of separate sexes.jghd species.
In northern climates peacock peasants must be kept indoors in the
winter if temperatures are lower than 35 0 F. (i-6* C.). Their life
expectancy sometimes exceed 10 years.

By George A. Smith (Peterborough, England)
The male of my pair of Port Lincoln Parakeets is very tame. (For the
purist in taxanomic matters they actually are Barnardius zonarius dundasi
and not B.z.zonarius). This otherwise very pleasing tameness has made
him something of a nuisance when breeding. For I cannot enter the
flight without being attacked unless I go to the bother of carrying a
black catching-net. The white net is practically useless as a prophylactic
for it is the blackness which frightens him more than the fear of being
caught. And each morning as I do my rounds of giving tit-bits of fruit
and protein I have to spend too much time making him pursue my left
hand--outside the wire--while my right hand sneaks inside and stealthily
changes the pots. Sadly his worse fault, which I believe comes from this
almost complete lack of fear, is to courageously climb right to the bottom
of the very long and dark nest-box where, if he can, he eats the eggs.
He developed his liking for eggs two days before the first clutch was
due to hatch and the two eggs that I rescued were badly cracked. However
the repairs made with transparent nail varnish held and one hatched under
Indian Ringnecks, Psittacula krameri , but it died because they would not
feed it, although they are excellent parents with their own chicks. The
Port Lincoln managed to eat all the second round after his wife had sat for
a full week. But from the third clutch I managed to take three eggs.
Two were given to Rock Pebblars 4 Polytelis anthopeplus , and the other
put under Redrumps, Psephotus haematonotus. All three hatched.
The differences between Port Lincoln chicks and those of Rock Pebblars
are very slight. It is mainly that the Rock Pebblars have slightly more
white down; have less pronounced barbs to the arrow-shaped tip of the
upper bill; and they may be fractionally larger and perhaps slightly less
helpless. Indistinct as these differences are the hen Rock Pebblar had no
difficulty in distinguishing them for, though she continued to brood the
mixed babies, she did not feed the Port Lincolns and one died before I
realised this neglect. The second hatched chick was rescued only just in
time. At about two days old he was extremely weak and, completely
starved of food, he lay partly immersed in a trio of fat Rock Pebblar chicks
each with a massive, filled crop. Only one of these well-fed chicks was
older than the neglected Port Lincoln. The starved chick was artificially
fed with " Farex " and milk and then, not wishing to become its wet-nurse,
it was put with the only available parent parrots, which were quite in-
experienced Bourke's Grass-parakeets, Neophema bourkii, with week-old
young. They accepted it immediately. After two more days the third
egg under the Redrumps hatched and I waited two days to make positively
certain that they were feeding it before I gave them the now seemingly
enormous " Cuckoo " Port Lincoln from the Bourke's nest. As a further

experiment I also gave an incubating Yellow-fronted New Zealand
parrakeet, Cyanoramphus auriceps , two Splendid Grass-parrakeet, N.
splendida , eggs; and a Barraband, Polytelis swainsonii , those of a Gold-
mantled Rosella, Platycercus eximius. These two foster-parents had
previously proved themselves to be good parents. The fostered eggs
hatched just before, or in the same period as the fosterers' own eggs, yet
like the Ringnecks and Rock Pebblar, they would not feed the fostered
chicks although they did not neglect their own.
In the available literature there are many accounts of different parrot
species successfully rearing quite alien forms. My personal knowledge
includes Redrumps (whose young have thick down and fledge when four
or five weeks old) hatching and rearing Indian Ringnecks (whose chicks
are born naked and spend almost twice as long in the box) and Budgerigars,
Melopsittacus undulatus, raising Quaker Conures, Myiopsitta monachus
until they became too large for the foster parents' feeding ability.
(Budgerigar chicks are naked, Quakers are downed and have, like the
majority of New World parrots, huge basal swellings to the upper
mandible). From, the literature we might especially note Fischer's
Lovebirds, Agapornis personata fischeri, successfully rearing a Splendid
Grass-Parrakeet with some of their own chicks (Boosey 1934 ); Bourke's
rearing Princess of Wales', Polytelis alexandrae (Harvey 1933 ); and Brown-
throated Conures, Aratinga pertinax, fostered from an early age by
Budgerigars (Williams 1907). Failures are not often given: West ( 1955 )
found that his Cockatiels, Nymphicus hollandicus, would not feed Crimson-
wings, Aprosmictus erythropterus.
Dilger (i960) reports that once Lovebirds, Agapornis spp., have had ex-
perience of feeding their own youngsters then the sexually differentiated
forms he studied--Madagascar cana; Abyssinian, taranta, --which have
white-downed young refused to feed the fresh-hatched chicks ofthelike-
sexed Lovebirds--and vice-versa. It might be noted that the species in
which the sexes are similar--Peach-faced, roseicollis; Masked, Black-
cheeked, Nyassa, Fischer's, personata ssp.--have a slightly more dense
down with a pink rather than a white colour. But should the parent
Lovebirds have had no experience of raising young then they would
feed chicks of the other group. He found, by experiment, that when Peach-
faced Lovebirds foster-reared as their first brood white-downed species of
Love-birds they would not subsequently feed their own pink-downed
chicks.
Dilger did not suggest how it is that Lovebirds can distinguish their
own offspring. It is unlikely they do it by sight. The difference between
pale pink and white would not be made out in the dim light of a nest
chamber. And, as Dilger notes, although experienced breeding Lovebirds
will not feed fresh hatched chicks of " opposite " forms this discrimination
does not apply to older chicks. That is when the visual differences
between the chicks are only too obviously apparent. I know of Cockatiels

accepting half-grown Bourke's, and Gold-mantled Rosellas, put in the
nest with their own young; yet when subsequently offered fresh-hatched
chicks in their next breeding cycle let them die unfed. It is my experience
that older chicks, provided they are not too close to fledging, get accepted
while in the box.
I believe that this discrimination against alien species comes because a
hen parrot experienced in rearing chicks has become attuned to react
quite specifically to the noises made by their hungry chicks. If the
subsequent chicks cannot give a correct sound then the parent is unable
to react and feed it. Neglect is therefore not " purposeful " but a psy-
chological inability to react to " strange " food-begging calls. If this is a
correct hypothesis then it must follow, from Diliger's experiment with the
Peach-faced Lovebirds, that the first experience that Lovebirds (and most
parrots?) have of hatching and rearing their chicks " imprints " them with
their specific chick noise for it seems not to be a hereditory knowledge but
something that has to be learnt. Following such imprinting the parents
can only respond to this or to very similar sounds.
The explanation for the development in parrots of this fine sense of
discrimination, to the food soliciting calls of very young chicks, is that
without it the smaller and younger members of a parrot brood would
probably die of starvation because of excessive attention being given by the
parents to the stronger, more actively soliciting, elder chicks.
Parrot hens usually begin the incubation of their eggs before the clutch
is complete. The youngest chicks, if they are to survive, must have a
greater allure for the parents to feed them than the elder chicks (Smith
1972). The eldest members of a brood, especially with the fast growing,
ground-feeding, forms, can be almost of adult size and weight, with
feathers, capable of maintaining their own body heat and are fed largely by
actively soliciting food from the parents. While the freshly hatched
youngest would be less than 10% of adult weight, completely blind
easily cooled and almost absolutely incapable of any physical movement
except to jerk its head vertically while being fed with its beak held by the
parent and of shuffling into sources of heat, the rest of the brood consisting
of various intermediates between these two conditions. Elder chicks
sound very noticeably different from the babies. Their food soliciting
call makes the parents regurgitate and feed, but it is not done with the
solicitude they show for the very young. I have repeatedly observed
that parrots excited enough to regurgitate food--and some parrots seem
to get literally sick with excitement--attempt to feed a noticeable projec-
tion, which is usually the bill of another bird. But isolated, sexually active
individuals can be seen to feed projecting twigs, knots of wood, spots of
paint and even their feet. I have seen a male Splendid call his wife to
the hole of the box to be fed and then proceed to feed a projecting nail,
rather than her, presumably because it offered more stimulus than her
stubby bill. Oddly she swallowed after each " feeding " just as if he

had fed her. An older chick waggling its head and moving its face
purposely towards the parent is easily seen and fed for it provides an
attracting feature--the bill which in all nestling parrots is light-coloured.
But the very young can barely raise their heads. They have to lie
because it is source of heat, immured beneath a cluster of their older
brethren. They must therefore have a means of attracting the parent
hearing it to purposely seek out the source of such a noise, regurgitate
pick up its beak and feed it. The noise must therefore be quite distinctive
from older chicks and, to a parrot, be most plaintive. It is therefore such
an important feature in the successful rearing of large broods that is
has become selectively attuned to a very high level of discrimination.
If this is so, and the evidence seems to point that way, then people
desirous of fostering eggs of parrots would be advised, if the parrot species
are quite dissimilar, to use inexperienced rather than experienced hens
for the purpose. Secondly valuable hens that have, for some reason or
other, no success in hatching their first round should not be used as fosters
for alien forms in case they become imprinted to these and will not, in
subsequent rounds, feed their own offspring.

Although there is usually an indication at the end of an article in the
magazine if it is thought that the account in question is a record of the
first breeding of a species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, it is not
always clear if an award has been made; and I have been asked to summarise
the more recent awards. I have taken as a starting point here those
breedings for which no award had been made by the end of 1970, although
the account may have been published in that year. In the list below the
year given is that of publication of the account in the magazine.
Medals awarded.

C. J. O. HARRISON--FIRST BREEDING MEDALS AND CERTIFICATES 225
Chester Zoo (W. H. Timmis). Schalow's Touraco, Tauraco
chalowi&amp;apos;, Jersey Wildlife Pres. Trust. (D. G. Roles). Victoria
Crowned Pigeon, Goura victoria&amp;apos;, Bristol Zoo (M. Sherborne).
It will be noted that some breedings, thought at first to be first records,
are omitted from the above list. Subsequent letters in the magazine
(vol. 73 : 48) indicated that the breeding of the Lesser Sulpher-crusted
Cockatoo, Cacatua sulphured sulphurea by C. Smith was not the first, and
we were notified of an earlier breeding of the Perfect Lorikeet, Trichoglossus
euteles , to that of K. Russell; by I. G. Hale in 1969. Notification was also
received of earlier breedings of the Crimson-rumped Waxbill, Estrilda
rhodopyga , and Chester's claim for the Yellow-breasted Bunting, Emberiza
aureola , has also been queried.
The Gold Coast Touraco, Tauraco persa, had already been bred under
the name Senegal Touraco by Captain H. S. Stokes in 1932. The
oversight here was a simple one, a list being lacking at the time, but more
problems are raised when taxonomic revisions of birds result in forms
which retain different English names, and which were previously regarded
as separate species, being grouped as subspecies of a single species. The
rules of the Society allow the award of a medal for the first breeding of a
species. Other medals may be awarded at the council's discretion for
breedings of special merit, but the award for a species must be for what is
regarded as a species in the current consensus of taxonomic opinion.
This rule seems to have been overlooked in the past in the case of some
parrot breedings, and had led to some confusion, especially since many
subspecies are not clearly defined entities. Two breedings during the
period under discussion are affected by this. The Double Yellow-headed
Amazon Parrot, bred by C. Smith, is now regarded as a subspecies,
Amazona ochrocephala oratrix , of the Yellow-headed Amazon, the
nominate form of which, the Yellow-fronted Amazon, had already been
bred by Mr. Smith and for which he had received the Society's medal.
The Lesser Patagonian Conure, Cyanoliseus p. patagonus , bred at Chester
Zoo, is regarded as a subspecies of a species including the Greater
Patagonian Conure, C. p. byroni , which had been bred in 1963 by W. R.
Partridge. Under the rule these two breedings do not therefore qualify as
first breedings of a species.
The breeding of Weber's Lorikeet, Trichoglossus haematodus weberi , by
R. T. Kyme, for which a medal was awarded in 1971 is therefore not an
award for a breeding of a species, but a discretional award for the first
breeding of a well-defined isolate of a species of which other subspecies
had already been bred. I personally feel that in instances where well-
defined subspecies are bred the onus is on the breeder to indicate the degree
of difference which he feels is involved, and which might justify an award;
although this is difficult in view of the small number of birds usually
involved, which tends to exaggerate the individual differences in behaviour
which are normally apparent. The final decision, right or wrong, must
rest with the Council.

However, some of my old reliable pairs failed and so the results were
not the very best. Here is the list: 3 Silver-eared Mesias (second
generation), 3 Blue-winged Sivas, 2 Redrump, 20 Bourke's and 2 Aymara
Parrakeets. There were no Cardinals as I had no room for them.
Nevertheless, two young females bred last year laid many eggs from the
perches, although I kept them separated from the cocks."

<bodyText confidence="0.987634545454545" page_id="56811714"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Several cases of ornithosis have been diagnosed in human patients
recently and almost invariably the source of the infection has been traced
to newly imported South American Parrots. Some clinicians believe
that the only solution to the problem is the immediate reintroduction of
restrictions on the importation of psittacine birds. Most bird lovers
would probably welcome such a move not only on medical but also on
humanitarian grounds. There can be little doubt that the appalling
conditions in which parrots and other birds are being imported and
maintained on many dealers' premises are probably the fundamental
cause of the present situation.

CURASSOWS AND RELATED BIRDS. By Jean Delacour and

<bodyText confidence="0.993623954545455" page_id="56811714"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Dean Amadon. New York: The American Museum of Natural
History. 1973. Price 20 dollars.
The game birds of the family Cracidae are found in the tropics and
sub-tropics of the Americas, from the border of Texas to northern
Argentina. They are much more aboreal than the pheasants and not so
brightly coloured. Many, however, are elegant in shape and have
brightly coloured skin ornaments, wattles and crests, on the head. The
variation in plumage between a number of different species is often
difficult to detect and their classification has had to be thoroughly revised.
This has been carried out by the authors, with the help of Dr. C. Vaurie
who had previously published detailed studies on this subject.
This book, thanks to the Phipps foundation, is profusely and beautifully
illustrated. Both the coloured plates and black and white drawings are
by Albert E. Gilbert, and in addition there are four colour plates by
George Miksch Sutton and one by David Reid-Henry, three skilled
artists whose work would be hard to surpass, and results in a magnificent
volume of great attactiveness.
The two distinguished authors give a wealth of documentation of the
Curassows, Guans and Chalchalacas, in particular with regard to their
characteristics and habits.
The records of these birds in captivity and their breeding as well as
information on their care is of especial interest and value to aviculturists

BREEDING OF THE BLUE-WINGED PITTA, PITTA MOLUCCENSIS,
AT THE WILDFOWL TRUST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986145230769231" page_id="56811715"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
In an article on the Wildfowl Trust published in the magazine recently Mr. T.
Johnstone casually mentioned the breeding of the Blue-winged Pitta, Pitta
moluccensis , in the tropical house. Since, as far as we are aware, there are no
records of succ essful breedings of any species of pittas in Britain as yet, we asked
for more details and Mr. Johnstone has supplied the following data--\0x25A0" First nest
building commenced on 21st May 1972; first egg on 2nd June. Four eggs were
taken away on 28th June and found to be clear. The second nest was built
quickly on 30th June. Four eggs were laid by 3rd July. Two hatched on 22nd
July. They left the nest on 7th August and one was found dead in the pond on
10th August. The second young one survived. Both parents incubated, brooded
and fed the young. There are other pittas and Sun Bitterns in the house, and the
adult female Blue-winged Pitta was found dead with a head injury some days
after the young hatched."

HON. TREASURER'S REPORT
We have published this year a Balance Sheet as well as a full Income
and Expenditure Account. From the latter you will see that your
Society made a loss of #308.42 last year due to rising costs and a fall in
Membership.
It has been decided not to increase the Membership fee but to effect
economies mainly in the production of the Magazine which we are
confident can be done without any fall in the high standard which has been
maintained for so long.
We would ask all Members to make every effort to interest others in
joining our Society. We would also welcome donations which can be
used to increase the number of coloured plates printed or for general
purposes, according to the donor's wish. The Society is registered as a
charity and a donation in the usual form of covenant will enable us to
reclaim tax. This does not apply to subscriptions.
The Balance Sheet, printed for the first time, takes into account
printing costs unpaid at the close of the year. The Society has for many
years paid its printer in arrears and it has been decided to sell our Bonds
to clear up this situation and enable us to renegotiate our printing. This
will leave the Society with very little reserves but we are confident that
these can be built up again.
I wish to acknowledge a generous anonymous donation of #100 to
assist us in carrying out the proposed changes.
H. J. Horswell,
Hon. Treasurer.

On January ist, 1974 I shall be replaced as Editor of the Avicultural
Magazine by John Yealland. In this my farewell and expression of
thanks to the many contributors who have made my task so gratifying
and enjoyable during the 34 years as Editor, I think perhaps I can best
summarize my experiences by quoting briefly a few paragraphs from the
Editorial I wrote in the 75th Anniversary Supplement published in
November 1969, Volume 75, No. 6. After an account of the early days
and problems of the Magazine I wrote:
" The situation remained difficult till 1925, after which the Magazine went from
strength to strength owing to the great ability and drive of Mr. David Seth-Smith
who had served as Editor (sometimes with a co-Editor) from 1901 to 1934, with
only an interval of 10 years from 1910-1920.
" It came, to say the least of it, as a surprise when, at an ornithological meeting
in 1938 Mr. Alfred Ezra, Monsieur Jean Delacour and Mr. David Seth-Smith
came up to me and said, ' We have an additional job for you, we want you to edit
the Avicultural Magazine '. ' But I can't ', I replied, ' I am not an aviculturist '.
' No matter we will help you.' And that is how it all began. Thanks to the
efforts of all three I gradually graduated to being an aviculturist."
Shortly afterwards the Second World War broke out.
" Like a snail with its shell I took the Magazine with me during my various
vicissitudes of the war--typing on rickety tables in billets--correcting proofs
during rare occasions when there was a lull during night duty at the Foreign Office,
and later finding even the pasting-up of the pages a relief and relaxation from the
underground existence deep in the Corsham caves in the production of a new
secret aircraft engine. When I lost my home and all my possessions by a direct
hit during the Battle of Britain the editorial headquarters of the Magazine were
literally a large suitcase.
" During 1940 the standard and size of the Magazine were maintained, but at
the end of that year with the fall in income and rise in cost of production it was
essential that economy should be made and it was therefore decided to publish
the Magazine every second month. With the progress of the war the pinch became
tighter, particularly with the advent of paper rationing, and the Magazine became
very slim.
" Since the war the Magazine has gradually built up again though with a
difference. Most of the great collections of the past have gone, but a new pattern
has appeared in the bird parks open to the public . . . which have proved that they
can give much interesting information and achieve first breedings, as well as serve
as an attraction for the public."
It has always been my aim to maintain a balance between scientific and
popular interests and the fact that at the present time articles are contri-
buted from all over the world is gratifying evidence of the wide scope of
our journal. This is due to all those who have made it possible, and I
would specially like to thank the printers--Messrs. Warren &amp; Sons Ltd.,
to bring the Magazine to the high standard it now enjoys. Though it
would be invidious to mention by name those who have given the greatest
help they themselves will realize how much is owed to them and how
grateful their Editor is for their unfailing support.
Mr. Yealland will undoubtedly maintain the standard of the Magazine
and in future all communications should be addressed to him at:
