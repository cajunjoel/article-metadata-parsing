THE GOULDIAN FINCH.
By A. F. Wiener.
Some 20 years ago the inmates of my aviary used to vary
in numbers between 300 and 500, mostly foreign finches.
My great ambition then was to obtain some living speci-
mens of Gould's Aegintha picta, or painted Finch, of which I had
seen a drawing and read a description in Gould's classical work
on the Birds of Australia.
The greatest disappointments I had during my experience
as a keeper of foreign finches were, that I never could find a
specimen of Gould's painted Finch, and never meet with a copy
of Gould's famous work at anything like a reasonable price.
Gould's book on Australian Birds was not to be had at that
time for less than sixty or eighty guineas, which would have
made it a rather expensive addition to an amateur's stock of
books of reference.
How very grateful we all should have been twenty-five
years ago if Dr. Butler's spendid work on Foreign Finches had
then existed.
At that time bird-keeping taxed the pocket of amateurs
rather heavily. I remember being made to pay #10 for one of
the first pairs of Leiothrix luteus which reached this country,
whilst now the same pretty birds can be bought for a few shillings.
The search for Gould's painted finch had however the
result that I came into possession of a good many rare finches
which I might have overlooked if a mild mania to find a specimen
of that Australian finch had not taken hold of me. To it I owe
that I bought one day from a sailor in the street, four little birds
which I thought might be young Gouldians imperfectly developed.
When I reached home and could examine them closely, I found
that they were something quite different, but further study
revealed that this primary mistake had put me by accident into
possession of quite a new species, which had until then been
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998416255813954" page_id="10098574"  page_num="2" year="" vol="">
unaccountably over-looked by all collectors and writers, and
which was subsequently named Pytelia wieneri , and determined
as of West African origin.
Last year I heard by the merest accident that somebody
had received a consignment of several hundred Gouldian finches,
and curiosity led me to go and see them, when I found a beauti-
ful lot of lively birds the sight of which brought back the
memory of my former vain endeavours to find Gould's painted
finch, and made me forget my resolve not to resume keeping
cage-birds.
Although the few Gouldian finches which I had seen at
the Zoological Gardens and in private collections generally look-
ed dull and out of condition, and I had heard and read that
Gouldians were delicate, stupid, and disappointing as cage birds,
I purchased two pairs, one Redheads and one Blackheads, with
the object of studying the habits of these finches.
And I must say that I never had any finches which interes-
ted me more, gave me more pleasure, and proved more satisfactory
cage birds.
I purposely refrained from selecting the best specimens.
I just took three birds as they came to hand ; and for number four
I selected a rather sickly looking hen, just to see whether there
would be any real difficulty in keeping her alive.
I placed them in a roomy cage, the floor of which was
thickly covered with gritty sand, which they at once enjoyed to
pick.
I was told that during their voyage the birds had only
been fed on canary seed. I supplemented this food with spray
millet, which they took greedily. Occasionally they would
however, for a day or two, return to the canary seed and abstain
from millet. The latter soon became their staple food ; now
they only eat a few grains of canary seed occasionally.
Let me repeat, however, that millet in the ear is the food
which these birds require, and that the millet seeds sold by
measure do not replace this. These stalks of millet are sold by
most bird dealers at one penny each, which makes it a dear bird
food. But there are several shops in London where it can
be bought of excellent quality at 1/6 and 2/- the large bunch of
fifty stalks.
My birds soon became so tame that, when I brought them
a fresh spray of millet, they had actually to be pushed out of the
way to enable me to fix it on the bars of the cage ; and they sat
on it and began to peck before my hand was out of the cage. As
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999309186046512" page_id="10098573"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
soon as they see me bringing a new supply of millet they chirp
something which sounds very much like " be quick."
The males soon began to sing, and their efforts at voice
production are very funny. An apparently great effort produces
but a very faint twitter, and I am inclined to call them feathered
ventriloquists.
I offered my birds a bath but they would not use it at first.
It was absolutely necessary to teach them to take a bath. To do
this I took a vaporiser, such as is used in sick rooms to produce
a fine spray of Eau de Cologne. This little machine I filled with
tepid water, approached the cage slowly and sent a gentle spray
of wet on the birds' backs. They evidently liked the sensation,
shook their feathers, hopped from perch to perch, and gradually
descended to the bottom of the cage. I followed their move-
ments with my gentle minute stream of water directed to their
backs, without ever frightening them. I continued this until
they jumped on the rim of their bath, took a drink, and then
jumped bodily into the bath. When they had once enjoyed the
delight of a bath it required no further persuasion or teaching.
They soon went into their little tub one after the other and
sometimes two at a time. But they are very particular that the
water is quite fresh and clean. Water which has been in the
cage for some hours and has become slightly fouled they will
not bathe in.
I believe however that most of the Gouldiau Finches will
naturally bathe without any persuasion, and the original objec-
tion of my birds to wash was only an individual peculiarity, or
perhaps partly due to my habit of putting a handful of clean
sand into the bath of my birds. This gives the birds a little
foothold ; and as they splash in the water particles of sand get
into the feathers, which has a twofold advantage, it makes the
birds shake themselves thoroughly afterwards, and the fine grains
of sand act on the feathers something like a currycomb does on
the coat of a horse. It has a distinct beneficial effect on the
beauty of a bird's plumage. Watching the sparrows in the
street who prefer a puddle to bathe in has taught me to try the
experiment. A Eondon sparrow knows what he is about, even
when he takes a bath in what looks like dirty water.
The plumage of my Gouldians was soon in a beautiful
state of perfection.
I next procured two husks of cocoa-nuts from a bird
dealer, such as are used for breeding Australian Budgerigars. I
fixed a husk on each side of the cage, removing one wire so

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999804139534884" page_id="10098572"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
as just to leave room enough for a bird to creep through and
into the cocoa nut. At first there was very great excitement
amongst the birds. They pretended to be frightened, but in less
than twenty-four hours female curiosity had gained the day.
The hen could not refrain from peeping in, at first very little,
but as nothing happened they grew bolder, put in their heads
and finally went in altogether. After a few days the males
followed boldly, and soon the black-headed cock had fairly taken
possession of one nest, the red-headed male of the other. There
was a great deal of scratching going on in the cocoanuts, but no
attempt was made to form the fibres into a nest or to carry in
additional material.
The black-headed male paid most attention to the red-
headed hen, but when the red-headed cock tried to flirt with
Miss Blackhead, the Black-headed male became very jealous.
In fact Mr. Blackhead became a decided bully, and considered the
cocoanuts as a kind of convenient ambush ; he laid in wait there
and darted out upon any bird that came near the small entrance,
when he would take the bird by the nape of the neck, by a wing
feather or by the tail if that came in his way. shake him well,
drop him, take a mouthful of food and retire quick as lightning
to the cocoanut. No harm was done, but the game looked so
dangerous that I inserted a partition in my cage one day. The
birds, however, did not like this and resented it by becoming
dull, wherefore I took the partition out again and the birds
brightened again at once ; no damage ever resulted from what
often looked like mortal feuds. The courtship of the red-headed
cock was very gentle in comparison with the impetuosity of his
black-headed cousin.
I did not expect to bring my bird number four, a black-
headed hen which I had picked ouc because she was sickly,
through the winter.
Whilst the other three birds were the picture of health
and happiness and continually on the move, that poor little hen
sat for hours sleepy, with her head under her feathers. But I fixed
a stalk of millet always within eas} 7 reach of her favourite perch ;
and if she did not bathe I occasionally damped her feathers with
injr toy water spray apparatus. As long as we can induce a bird
to eat and to keep his plumage clean there is always a chance.
Several times I thought her at death's door, and twice I
picked her up from the floor of the cage more dead than alive.
I found in each case that she was egg bound. Some people give
whisky in such a case, others oil, but I do not much believe in

<bodyText confidence="0.999377441860465" page_id="10098571"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
either remedy. I took about half a yard of new flannel and
heated it as much as I could without burning it. Whilst the
flannel was getting hot, I put the bird into a dish containing
about an inch of cold water, carefully supporting her head
with the hand in which I held the bird. After one or two
minutes' immersion I wrapped the bird in the hot flannel, and
left her undisturbed for about lialf-an-hour. In each case I
thought I should find my bird dead on undoing the flannel
wrapper, instead of which she had laid a soft egg, and seemed
perfectly recovered and all right again, fit to be put back
into the cage. At various times I found the shells of several
perfect eggs in the cage, and do not know whether these eggs
were laid by the red-lieaded or the sickly black-headed hen.
But I believe the tyrannical, impetuous black-headed cock turned
cannibal and ate those eggs as soon as they were laid, leaving me
only the broken shells.
During the winter my four birds kept in very good health.
Their cage stood in my sitting room. I took no special pre-
cautions as regards temperature, and the room was thoroughly
aired every morning by opening the windows irrespective of the
weather prevailing. I think it is a great mistake to cover a
bird cage at night, and therefore never do so ; but we should be
very careful so to place our bird-cages that they are never even
for a moment in a draught.
About February my Gouldian finches began to moult.
Their appetites remained good, and except that the black-headed
cock was less aggressive and less pugnacious than formerly, there
was very little change in their habits or manners. The formerly
sickly hen quite recovered.
But month after month passing without the moult being
completed, I came to the conclusion that there must be some-
thing wanting in the food, and that canary seed and millet were
not a quite sufficient substitute for their natural food. I tried
sesame seed, but the birds though occasionally picking up a
grain did not care for it. Green food, such as lettuce, groundsel,
watercress, etc., they would not touch or look at. During a visit
to South Wales, I remembered that my Gouldians were really
Grass finches and I gathered stalks of about a dozen different
kinds of grass then flowering. But not one of these would my
birds touch. I tried slices of apple, banana, and greengages,
very ripe fruit in every case, but the Gouldians would not eat any.
A lady to whom I had presented a pair of Gouldians wrote
to me that her birds were in magnificent colour and ate sugar.

<bodyText confidence="0.999468976190476" page_id="10098538"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
As soon as I heard this I took a lump of sugar, crushed it and
threw it on the sand. The first day my birds picked up some
morsels but afterwards did not seem to care for any more.
I next tried a berry of a very sweet muscatel grape, and
the juice of this the Gouldians drank with avidity; and thus I
had at last found some dainty morsel which the birds liked.
Towards the end of July I gathered some flowers in a
friend's garden, and in doing so I gathered some stalks of an
ornamental grass. The thought occurred to me that my
Gouldians might fancy this, and I offered them a little, which
they took with great zest. When I gave more they finished
every morsel, and the effect of this additional food was very
remarkable. The moult finished in a couple of days, and the
colouring of the plumage became brighter than I had ever seen
it before.
I sent a specimen of the grass to Messrs. Sutton &amp; Son,
the eminent seed growers of Reading, who kindly supplied the
botanical name, viz. Sctaria glajica, and added the following
information:--"Dr. Vasey of the U. S. A. Department of
Agriculture states, in his work on the Agricultural Grasses of
the United States, that the seeds of Sctaria glauca and Sctaria
viridis are eagerly sought for by birds and poultry, especially
among the stubble after harvesting wheat."
My Gouldiau finches were within 3 days after tasting this
seed in the most perfect plumage, and my sickly hen is as well
and strong as any cage bird can be. Within 5 days both hens
began to lay, and this time without any mishap or trouble what-
ever, and the eggs were perfectly developed and had hard shells.
Soft eggs and eggbinding seem to be a thing of the past.
Certainly the black-lieaded Cock broke and ate the eggs
again. If he were not such a beauty and such a very interesting
individual to watch, I should be inclined to wring his neck or
exchange him for another.
Anyhow, my two pairs of Gouldiau finches purchased
about a year ago are now in better health and plumage than
they were when I received them, have proved to be fairly hardy
and very interesting cage birds of very great beauty, and I have
no doubt that it would be comparatively easy to breed any num-
ber in captivity.
As I have not at present access to a copy of Gould's work
on Australian Birds I should be grateful to Dr. Butler if he
would kindly say whether the birds now known as Gouldiau

finches are identical with Gould's painted finch (Aegintka picta)
or a variety of the same family? (a)
In conclusion, I may add that I used to find the beautiful
Australian Fire Finch (Aegintka phaeton) also most difficult to
keep until I purchased, one day as an experiment, a lot of sixteen
exceptionally healthy specimens. To these I gave some flower-
ing wild grass from the roadside; and I had the satisfaction of
seeing this rare and delicate Australian Grassfinch nesting and
hatching a brood in my aviary, which success I also attribute to
having accidentally found the right sort of grass seed.

their somewhat ungainly actions, their love for bright articles,
their nests, the long oval form and heavily blotched character
of their eggs, they seem to show some affinity to the Corvidee.
I purchased a young pair of this species in the green
plumage on September 18th, 1899. Although many examples
have at various times been acquired by our Zoological Society, I
found that a pair, even of tailless young birds, was by no means
to be obtained cheaply ; but, though so many have come under
observation, I discovered that there was still some doubt as to
the manner in which the change from the young to the adult
plumage took place, and the desire to study this point was an
additional incentive to the acquisition of this beautiful species.
In the Museum ' Catalogue of Birds ' we read that the
young male " resembles the female at first, but is generally to be
distinguished by a few purplish-black feathers appearing on the
head and back, or on the quills. The body plumes appear to be
acquired by a direct moult; but the quills and tail-feathers
become black by a change in the colour of the feather itself."
(a) Emblemapicta is the true name of the bird : it is figured in my book, and is quite
distinct from the Gouldian finch. I placed it doubtfully among the Waxbills, but it is
probably more nearly related to the Diamond Sparrow.--A.G.B.

Now, before going any further, I may say that, unless my
male is in every respect exceptional, the above account is
incorrect in almost every detail :--when young, the male mainly
differs from the female in its superior size and more aggressive
behaviour ; at first it has no black markings anywhere, but after
a time these begin to appear irregularly on the crown, nape,
greater wing-coverts and sides of breast.
So far as I could discover, the change of colour (which
occupies just a year) was produced precisely in the opposite
manner to that described in the Catalogue. Contrary to my
expectation the birds did not moult in our spring ; the colour-
ing of the male gradually spread from month to month, so slowly
that, if produced by a moult of the body-feathers, they must
have been shed singly. At no time was there any litter of
feathers, as is the case with most birds when moulting.
About the end of July the quills and stumps of the tail-
feathers began to fall out, perhaps one or two in a day, and
before these were all dropped the new richly-coloured feathers
began to replace those that were lost; so that the birds were
never hampered or crippled in their flight like many soft-food
birds. The full colouring was not attained until near the end of
September, 1900.
The adult colouring of the male Satin Bower-bird, when
living, varies somewhat according to the light in which it is
viewed : seen from below the prevailing colour is intense glossy
black, the eyes looking almost brown ; when, however, the bird
descends to the floor of the aviary the whole of the plumage,
excepting the flights becomes satiny Prussian blue, the iris being
of a transparent brilliant ultramarine blue. According to
Gould the iris is " beautiful light blue, with a circle of red round
the pupil: " possibly this may be the case in some examples,
but both of my birds, as well as a pair Mr. Housden possessed,
could only be properly described as having eyes of the colour
of " Reckitt's Paris Blue" or ultramarine. If closely examined
I daresay the red ring round the pupil exists, which would
account for the brownish appearance of the eyes when the light
does not fall direct upon them.
The blue-black feathers, which cover the base of the
culmen and nostrils of the upper mandible, give the bill of the
male a deceptively shortened appearance.
The general colouring of the female is greyish green, the
rump and upper tail-coverts being brighter; the greater and
primary wing-coverts are reddish-brown, the innermost coverts

being tipped with whity-brown; the quills are dull brown,
reddish externally; the secondaries are tipped with whity-
brown ; the tail is golden brown with the central feathers some-
what ashy ; the ear-coverts and cheeks are grey-brownish streaked
with yellowish ; the throat ashy brown mottled with greenish :
under parts otherwise yellowish, varied on the breast with deep
brown bars which become indistinct on the front of the abdomen
and gradually disappear; under wing-coverts yellow, with dusky
bars, axillaries greener.
According to Gould the irides of the female are of a
deeper blue than in the male : but I am unable to endorse this
statement, for I can discover no difference in the eyes of the two
sexes.
Of the wild life of this bird Gould writes: " It is a
stationary species, but appears to roam from one part of a
district to another, either for the purpose of varying the nature,
or of obtaining a more abundant supply ot food. Judging from
the contents of the stomachs of the many specimens I dissected,
it would seem that it is altogether frugivorous, or if not
exclusively so, that insects form but a small portion of its diet.
Independently of numerous berry-bearing plants and shrubs,
the brushes it inhabits are studded with enormous fig-trees, to
the fruit of which it is especially partial. It appears to have
particular times in the day for feeding, and when thus engaged
among the low shrub-like trees, I have approached within a few
feet without creating alarm ; but at other times the bird
was extremely shy and watchful, especially the old males, which
not unfrequently perch on the topmost branch or dead limb of
the loftiest tree in the forest, whence they can survey all around,
and watch the movements of their females and young in the
brush below.
" In the autumn they associate in small flocks, and may
often be seen on the ground near the sides of rivers, particularly
where the brush descends in a steep bank to the water's edge.
" The extraordinary bower-like structure . . first came
under my notice in the Sydney Museum. . . This so much
interested me that I determined to leave no means untried for
ascertaining every particular relating to this peculiar feature
in the bird's economy ; and on visiting the cedar-brushes of the
Liverpool range, I discovered several of these bowers or playing-
places on the ground, under the shelter of the branches of over-
hanging trees, in the most retired part of the forest: they differed
considerably in size, some being a third larger than others.

The base consists of an extensive and rather convex platform of
sticks firmly interwoven, on the centre of which the bower itself
is built: this, like the platform on which it is placed, and with
which it is interwoven, is formed of sticks and twigs, but of a
more slender and flexible description, the tips of the twigs
being so arranged as to curve inwards and nearly meet at the
top: in the interior the materials are so placed that the forks of
the twigs are always presented outwards, by which arrangement
not the slightest obstruction is offered to the passage of the
birds. The interest of this curious bower is much enhanced
by the manner in which it is decorated with the most gaily
coloured articles that can be collected, such as the blue tail-
feathers of the Rose-hill and Pennantian Parralceets, bleached
bones, the shells of snails, etc. ; some of the feathers are
inserted among the twigs, while others with the bones and shells
are strewed about near the entrances. The propensity of these
birds to fly off with any attractive objedl, is so well-known to
the natives, that they always search the runs for any small
missing article that may have been accidently dropped in the
brush. I myself found at the entrance of one of them a small
neatly-worked stone tomahawk, of an inch and a half in length,
together with some slips of blue cotton rags, which the birds
had doubtless picked up at a deserted encampment of the
natives.
" It has now been clearly ascertained that these curious
bowers are merely sporting-places in which the sexes meet, and
the males display their finery and exhibit many remarkable
actions, and so inherent is this habit, that the living examples,
which have from time to time been sent to this country, continue
it even in captivity."
Mr. Gould never discovered the nest and eggs: the latter
were first described by Dr. Ramsay from specimens collected by
Mr. Ralph Hargrave, at Wattamolla, New South Wales.
The nest is composed of sticks and twigs, and is lined
with grass. The number of eggs appears to be two, long ovals
of a rich cream or pale stone-colour, " spotted and blotched with
irregular patchy markings, and a few dots of umber and sienna-
brown of different tints, in some almost approaching blackish-
brown, in others of a yellowish colour ; the larger markings are
as usual on the thicker end, but a few appear with the small
dots on the thin end. In this, the usual form, the irregular,
short wavy lines "(--" some resembling ill-shaped figures of
fives, eights, and sevens, others being long and wavy"--),

"seldom appear except where the larger spots or blotches are
confluent; as if beneath the surface of the shell are a few
irregular shaped, faint markings of slaty grey or pale lilac."
The Satin Bower-bird inhabits New South Wales, and
ranges throughout Eastern Australia to Rockingham Bay and
Port Denison.
Of the notes of the bird little has been written, but Gould
quotes the following remarks from a letter which he received
from a Mr. F. Strange :--
" At times the male will chase the female all over the
aviary, then go to the bower, pick up a gay feather or a large
leaf, utter a curious kind of note, set up his feathers erect, run
round the bower, and become so excited that his eyes appear
ready to start from his head, and he continues opening first one
wing and then the other, uttering a low whistling note, and,
like the domestic Cock, seems to be picking up something from
the ground, until at last the female goes gently towards him,
when, after two turns round her, he suddenly makes a dash, and
the scene ends."
In the case of my birds, to which I have devoted a small
aviary, no bower has been built, although I supplied plenty of
sticks ; probably because the male was only assuming its adult
plumage. He however constantly sings to the hen, puffs out his
feathers, arches his back, alternately opens and shuts one wing
or the other, flies round with a dropped quill-feather in his beak
and once he so alarmed his wife that she turned on her back,
on the earth with open beak and claws up to defend herself. My
man came running to me crying--" He's done it, I said he
would ; lie's killed her ! " and certainly it looked like it until I
went inside the aviary, when she was up and off to her favourite
roost in a second.
The song is a most comical performance, and resembles
nothing so much as water, containing bits of cabbage-leaf,
running down a sink, and interspersed here and there with clear
Starling-like notes: the alarm note is a jarring monosyllable
most like the word scoot with a very rough hesitation on the c.
As this species is particularly nervous and excitable the alarm-
note is often heard.
It is difficult to express the sounds of the song in words,
but the idea it conveys to the mind is a rapid ivhozzle-whozzle-
whozzle-sgrrrr, with variations.

household bread, one part each of yolk of egg and ants' eggs,
and a little Abrahams' food ; sometimes I add a little fine pea-
flour. I moisten this either with a sprinkling of water or an
admixture of potato. I also give grapes, orange, apple and
sometimes pear; but the last is hardly ever eaten.
Gould was certainly wrong in supposing that this species
was almost, if not altogether, frugivorons; for insedls of all
kinds are eaten with the greatest avidity, and my birds will
swallow cockroaches as long as I can supply them, gulping
them down whole one after another.

(Chloropsis hodgsoui.)
By H. C. HESEETON.
This is a handsome bird, a native of S.E. India, and a
member of a species rarely imported (I found it very delicate to
bring over) but which, when here and properly looked after, is
much hardier and easier to cater for than many less rare birds.
The plumage of body, wings and tail is a bright grass
green ; the inner web of principal wing-feathers being nearly
black ; the whole of the plumage being well glossed ; a dark
y-ellow patch on forehead tinged with orange at base of bill ;
throat a bright metallic blue, this colour forming a bib meeting
in the centre, not like the Malabar, one of which I have, the blue
in the latter being a stripe on each side of the mouth. The blue
bib of Hodgsoni is followed by another of black extending well
-down on the breast and edged by a pale 3 T ellow border which
fades into the bod) r colour of green. Beak blackish and slightly^
curved; feet and legs blue-green. There is a small patch of
ver} 1, light blue on the extreme part of wing-butts but this can-
not be seen unless the wings are extended.
This bird seems to be purely arboreal. I have never seen
it on the floor of my aviary, its food and water being placed
amongst the branches of the tree. The food consists of a few
ants' eggs, fruit, and about twelve mealworms per da\ r ; the
worms are preferred when they have just cast their skins, being-
soft, but not soft enough evidently as the bird beats them against
its perch, runs them thro' its beak several times, throws them in
the air, catches and swallows them. It is fond of bananas,
plums, and soft pears, and I make these the "base" food. It
drinks or rather sips b} r putting its long tongue in the water,
and bathes every da}\

The song is bright and cheerful though not of extended
compass ; the call notes seem to be two, one a harsh note some-
thing like that of the Sliama, the other a very fine loud whistle.
It is extremely tame, feeding from my hand although it
is in a cage 8ft. square.
I am not acquainted with the district from which these
birds are brought, but think it must be a fairly temperate one, as
the plumage is thick, and whilst always throwing a few downy
feathers, the bird always looks like paint and does not seem to
mind a little cold weather. When I bought it it was in its nest-
feathers, and all the colours and markings were dull and
indistinct.

BREEDING OF THE MALABAR MYNAH.

<bodyText confidence="0.999462142857143" page_id="10098545"  page_num="13" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Some of the readers of the " Avicultural Magazine " may
remember how, about two years ago (1898), I was successful in
getting a pair of Malabar Mynahs to make two nests and to lay
two lots of eggs in succession ; but although they sat steadily
and did all in their power to hatch those eggs, still being
unfertile, the task proved hopeless ; although it called out much
patience and persistent effort. Whose fault it was I cannot say,
as both birds seemed in perfect health and condition ; but so it
was, those eggs refused to hatch, and at last even the patience of
the Malabars, or, as a neighbour's poultrymau will call them (with
a fine disregard to correctness) &apos; Balamars,' was exhausted and
they gave up the case as a bad job. At the end of the season I
sold them to my friend ' Balamar,' but during the next winter he
lost them both : from want, I think, of sufficient live food.
For a year I remained without any Malabars ; but one day
this summer I was looking at a friend's aviary at York, and he
happened to have an odd Malabar, the finest cock, I think, I
ever set eyes on--quite a monster. He had once belonged to Mr.
Fulljames, but, on the disposal of his birds, had emigrated
North. After a little bargaining I got him transferred to myself;
and after seeing him comfortably settled in his new home, and,
on the principle that neither for Starlings nor man is it ' good to
be alone,' I wrote to London and procured him a mate. His joy
on seeing her was pathetic. She, I must say, seemed (or
pretended to seem) coy and amazed at his bold demonstrative
ways. There was no mistaking that he was a disciple of
Herrick, as he gaily warbled

Come, live with me and be my love,
And we will all its pleasures prove.
After a few days she consented and came.
I think there can be no doubt that Malabar Mynahs, like
all Starlings, are red Republicans : their sober and Quaker-like
garb reminds one instantly of one of Cromwell's preachers.
And one could quite imagine one addressing the other as ' Praise
God Barebones,' or ' Smite-them-liip-and thigh Amalek.' Sober
in mind as in apparel, he sets his face steadfastly against ' all
the pomps and vanities of this wicked world '--the quarrels of
Crimson-finches; the absurd dancing of Waxbills; the gaudy
appearance of Blue Mountain Rories. He holds that life is a
struggle ; he believes that Starlings, like men, are ' born to
labour,' and that the whole duty of Mynahs is worms. The
Malabar, therefore, cannot be brought to see the ritilitj r of a
Manycolour's wing patch ; the fat aldermanic deportment of the
apopletic Diamond Sparrow ; and has no patience with the silly
habit of the Mocking-bird, who spends his freedom in tuning
his voice. P&apos;or a Turquoisine father, with a rising family, he has
some respect; but for a frivolous little Zosterops, well, he can't,
for the life of him, see why such silly things were made. He
holds, with apologies to the author of ' Farm Ballads':
Some birds were born for great things ;
Some birds were born for small ;
Some -- it is not recorded
Why they were born at all.
The Malabar Mynah believes fully in leading a righteous and
sober life. He rises early, late takes rest, and eats the bread of
carefulness. He is the first to rise in the morning, and the last
to go to bed at night. He and his missus remind me of a Dutch
burgher and his frau : they are well though soberly dressed ;
well fed, of grave deportment, and so respectable that scandal
hesitates to whisper their name. They seem to say what the
Sliunamite said to Elisha : ' I dwell among mine own people.'
They never meddle with what does not concern them ; and
herein set us humans a good example.
My Malabars were not long over their courting; they
evidently, like our American cousins, hold with ' no blamed
foolishness' of that kind. Mrs. Malabar soon said 'Yes,' and
then she evidently meant business. ' The wife is heart or head.'
as Josh Billings slily says somewhere, and we (who have tried it)
all know how persuasive the wife is--especially when she wants
something. Well, Mrs. Malabar wanted a family, and she set
about having it.

Mr. Malabar evidently believed in the words of the
immortal Josh when he says, 'Whenever i find a real hansum
wuman engaged in a wimmin&apos;s rights lrizzness, then i am goin'
to take mi hat under mi arm and jine the procession.' So
Master Mynah 'jined.'
The amount of hay these birds conveyed into their
nesting box would surprise you. They worked early and late.
The lining was most peculiar, for it consisted of dry box-leaves.
Malabars, like sailors, take watch and watch about. I never can
make out whether they come off at any stated time, or when the
spirit moves them ; I think the latter. When off duty the
gentleman spends his time sitting on a bough, and tuning up : I
believe he thinks he can sing.
You hear a sound that seems to wear
The semblance of a tune,
As if a broken fife should strive
To drown a cracked bassoon.
Occasionally he visits the nest and pops in his head carefully,
and asks the missus how she is getting on. What the answer is
I do not know ; but something short and uncomplimentary, I
fancy, by the rapid way he withdraws his head.
The lady, when off duty, has a sober eye to business.
First she attends to the cravings of the inner man, and then,
like all ladies, she spends a Jew hours at her toilet. Then
suddenly she bethinks her that it is time to go and see what that
idiot of a husband is up to ; and she goes--and he comes, and
makes no silly delay about it.
On the morning of Wednesday, August 15th, when I went
in to feed, I found sundry blue egg-shells on the floor, so that
I knew that the family had arrived. For the first few days
the Malabars fed the young from the crop, as I particularly
watched to see, for they swallowed everything they picked up ;
but, on Thursday, August 17th, I saw them begin to carry the
live stock in their bills, after thoroughly beating the life out of
it 011 the window sill. What silly r twaddle it is to tell people
that they must always kill the mealworms before giving them to
the birds ! Bless me, old Mother Nature has taught them what
to do themselves, and the} 7 do it; if learned scientists will only
observe them, instead of trying to teach them.
The excreta are carried out by the old birds, after about
the second day; until then, I suppose, they are either too
insignificant to do any harm, or the old birds swallow them.
They always carry them to the very farthest point the} 7 can, and

then whittle their beaks on a bough, like a butcher sharpening
his knife, before he cuts you off a steak or a chop.
When going to feed, there is a regular system of signals :
a sort of 'Hullo, my dear, I'm here, are you quite ready?&apos;
Sometimes the lady is not, and she takes no notice. Then Mr.
Malabar grows impatient. ' Hullo,' he says, ' hullo, hullo-o-o ! '
and when he gets like this, she comes--and in he pops. The
way they limb the poor cockroaches is a caution to rattlesnakes.
No doubt 3^oung Malabars appreciate ' cockroach chops,' or
'clock trotters,' but think of the feelings of the poor clock, as
he is scientifically chipped to pieces. I have seen them remove
one leg at a time, leaving the poor wretch after each amputation
to carry his leg to the nest ; but there, I won't be horrid, you
can picture the rest--Leeds Infirmary, on ' Operating Day,' is
not in it.
Now let me sa} T a word on rearing such birds as Malabar
Starlings. I have read in 'Cassell's Foreign Cage Birds' that
Mr. Wiener professes to have reared some Malabars on ordinary
soft mixtures, which he buried in mould and made the birds
search for it, and a fciv mealworms and spiders occasionally, and
a little chopped raw meat. I do not wish to say that the account
is apocryphal ( b ), but shall we say it is to be taken cum grano ?
I say so for the following reasons (i) I have tried chopped meat,
just for curiosity ; they would not so much as look at it, let alone
eat it. (2) They would not eat the ordinary soft mixture them-
selves, let alone feed with it.
Now let me tell you a true story of what it takes to rear a
nest of Malabars. I watched the old birds feeding, and during
fifteen minutes they alternately visited the nest ten times between
them. They took each time thirty fresh wood ants' eggs each, or
two big mealworms, or a mashed up black clock. This went 011
from dawn until dusk ; forty visits an hour for ten hours equals
four hundred. Say each time they took thirty ants' eggs or their
equivalent, it means twelve thousand per diem. Now can you
credit that anyone reared young on soft food, a little chopped raw
beef, a fciv mealworms and spiders occasionally ? Maybe, I say,
your ' cargo hatch ' will hold it; mine wont. And this, bear in
mind, goes on for weeks and weeks. No one who has not tried,
knows what it means to rear a nest of such birds as Malabars.
The young Malabars left the nest on Sunday, September
2nd, on the principle, I suppose, that ' the better the day the

lest his word be doubted.--A.G.B.

better the deed.' There were four of them, all lusty and strong.
For a few days they perched about, but soon learned to fly any
where. In appearance they are nearly white about the head and
breast, and ashy-grey-brown on the back, beaks nearly white,
eyes grey-blue with black centre.
The other day, in looking over a back number of the
Magazine, I learned that my cock Malabar was a noted Palace
winner, spoken of there by Dr. Butler as a capital specimen.
He adds the scathing comment, ' I prefer Mr. Housden's Crested
Mynah, rarer and far more intelligent.' Has Dr. Butler ever
kept a Malabar Mynah ? ( c) Few birds I know can beat
Malabars for nous.
And now I think I had better draw to a close, or else you
will be saying that there's a lot of truth in the old saw--
The Magpie can talk for a terrible span,
And so, by gow, can a Yorksliireman.

WINTER.
By A. F. Wiener.
The season is now beginning which too often brings many
disappointments to owners of the prettiest small exotic finches,
because it brings death to so many. A few hints how to minimise
the mortality in winter, may therefore be useful and welcome to
some readers of the Magazine.
My aviary at Herne Hill was heated by hot water pipes.
It was divided into compartments of about 12ft. long by 6ft.
wide and 8ft. high. The floor of these was raised 2ft. above the
level of the passage which led through the aviary. Each
compartment had a small fountain, was furnished with some
evergreen shrubs in pots, and numerous perches of many kinds.
The food I used to give in white china dishes placed on the
sanded cement floor.
I was always careful not to crowd my cages with too many
birds, and to locate quarrelsome species apart from the small
exotic finches, Waxbills, etc., which were my special favourites.
With the advent of the first winter the mortality among
my birds became very considerable. Every morning I found a

sixth as much for it as he did for his Crested Mynah : it is common, but not regularly
imported, probably because there is no great demand for it.--A.G.B.

number of my little birds dead on the floor. I thought the
heat of between 50 and 55 0 F., which my self-registering
thermometer indicated as minimum, had been insufficient. The
boiler was thereupon driven to its utmost capacity and the
temperature raised a few degrees, but that did not in the least
diminish the mortality. 1 could not understand why birds,
which were perfectly well one day, should be found dead the
next morning in perfect plumage. When I began to dissect the
dead bodies I soon found the cause, and a little reflection pointed
out the remedy.
The crops of my dead pets were invariably empty : they
evidently had died from exhaustion and hunger in an aviary
with plenty of food in view. A visit to my aviary at dawn
confirmed what I suspected. When the birds woke up hungry,
the stronger ones took possession of the food dishes and drove
away the weaker and smaller kinds. The latter came to grief,
not from cold, but from want of sufficient food during the very
long nights of a London winter.
All birds digest and assimilate their food very rapidly.
Finches of the size of a Canary cannot survive want of food for
twenty-four hours. I found that the smaller a bird is, the
greater becomes the amount of food he requires in proportion to
his own weight to sustain life and strength. No cage bird, at
least no finch, feeds in the dark. The small exotic finches
coming from the Tropics, where all the year round the length of
the night does not vary very much, their organism could endure
a fast of about twelve hours, but not a London December ni ght
of sixteen, seventeen, or eighteen hours.
Thereupon I purchased as many petroleum lamps with tin
reflectors as I had compartments in my aviary containing small
exotic birds. These lamps I placed outside the cages in such a
position that the light was thrown all night on the food-dishes,
whilst the favourite sleeping-perches of the birds were near the
roof and to some extent in the shade. After this, when a bird
felt hungry at night, he saw where food could be found, flew
down, had a good feed, and returned to his sleeping-place in the
shade.
This very simple arrangement arrested the mortality in a
very remarkable manner, and from that day I had practically no
losses (d). I had even the pleasure of seeing a pair of Brazilian
[d) I have also found this plan, if not essential, at all events most beautiful to our
British summer migrants, especially by the soft-billed species.--J.L.B.

Saffron-finches hatching a brood at Christmas, and bringing: it
up, without any mishap, in the early days of January.
I had no further anxiety about the temperature of my
aviary. On the principle that even in tropical countries there
are sometimes cold nights, I was quite unconcerned if the
thermometer fell during great frost to 45* or 40*, and never lost
an}' birds from cold.
Years afterwards, I was living in France and kept half-a-
dozen delicate Waxbills in a cage in my sitting-room. This was
lighted by shaded lamps. At ten every evening the shade from
the lamp was moved for a time, when my little birds woke up
and had their supper. When they had eaten enough, the shade
was replaced, and my little birds went to sleep again. I kept
half-a-dozen birds during several years without losing one, and
all the time in perfect condition.
Canaries and finches of the size of Canaries can, as a rule,
endure the long fast consequent on our long winter nights, but
the smaller finches and Waxbills cannot, and that is the chief
cause of their mortality which can very easily be avoided.
Covering up birdcages is a very great mistake. Every
bird requires his food as soon as there is sufficient daylight to
find it, and, if then covered up and thereby kept in the dark, is
practically starved. Some individual birds do not like artificial
light: in such cases a small piece of paper or any other material
may be used just to shade a little the spot where the bird
habitually perches at night.

Sir, --With reference to Mr. Seth-Smith's article on the Long-tailed
Grassfinch (P. acuticauda) may I be allowed to say that, in Germany, the
difference of colour in the bill is believed to denote two distinct species.
According to " Die Gefiederte Welt," No. 34 of the current year, 1900,
it is stated that the Long-tailed Grassfinches, with what Mr. Seth-Smith
calls reddish orange beaks, are Poephila hecki ; those with yellow beaks
Poephilu acuticauda. The difference between the two distinct species has onlv
lately been ascertained. The article in question mentions that even Dr. Russ
himself believed the yellow - beaked variety to be identical with the
reddisli-orange-beaked birds, and that the darker coloured denoted adult
plumage. Since his death it has been proved that two distinct varieties

exist. " Die Gefiederte Welt " is of such undoubted authority in ornith-
ological matters that I venture to quote this information.

SHAMA WITHOUT TAIL.

<bodyText confidence="0.998789533333333" page_id="10098552"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have a SliSma which has no tail. Upon examination, I find
there are no signs of tail-feathers coming. Is this usual in this kind of bird ?
Can you advise any treatment likely&apos; to cause the growth of tail-
feathers ? as it makes him very unsightly. I have had him a month, and he
is quite healthy and sings well. I feed him on Carl Capelle's insectivorous
food, ants' eggs, a few mealworms, and a liberal supply of gentles. He
does not seem to care for fruit. Arthur Gire.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Gill :
You can encourage the reproduction of feathers by giving phosphates
in the drinking-water -- eight drops daily of syrup of phosphates to a wine-
glassful of water.
It is not natural for a Shama to be without a tail; but, if knocked
out soon after it has been produced, a tail is frequently a long time before
it reappears. My Satin Bower-birds were tailless for about nine months,
but now they are both perfect. A. G. BuTrer.

PROPOSED AVIARY FOR WEAVERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998205555555556" page_id="10098552"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- W ill you please let me know, by post, the following questions,
viz. : ist. Would 60 ft. long by 24 ft. broad be too large to keep Weavers
in ? 2nd. How many would it hold ? 3rd. What are the best shrubs to put
in ; would honeysuckle hurt the birds ? 4th. Would it be best to turf and
gravel the outer run, or cement ? 5th. What height should it be ? 6th. If
too large for Weavers only, what could I keep with same?
C. Castre-Sroane.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Sloane :
An aviary can hardly be too large, if you desire to breed Weavers.
In such an aviary as you speak of it would be possible to keep upwards of
fourteen hundred Weavers in health, but there would then be no possibility&apos;
of breeding, which (after all) is one of the most interesting features of
aviculture.
I do not think honeysuckle would hurt the birds, but they would
remove it all in a day or two : I should recommend you to cut a quantity of
reeds, bind them in bundles--towards the bottom of the stems -- and stack
them upright at one end of the aviary, so as to simulate a reed-bed : it is
then quite likely&apos; that you would breed the more beautiful reed-frequenting
Weavers.
The advantage of cement is that it keeps out rats : for this reason
the floors of all my aviaries are cemented. I would not recommend living
shrubs, because no finches will allow shrubs to live long unless the area is
very extensive and the birds comparatively&apos; few in number. If you think
of breeding, I should recommend one cock and several hens of each
species to begin with. Of course you would include the smaller Wliydalis.
I should not recommend that the aviary&apos; be more than ten feet high :
it is difficult to catch birds in very lofty aviaries. A. G. Butrer.

for they are always, I think, held from a Tuesday to Thursday,
thereby saving unnecessary Sunday labour. This year was no
exception, the Exhibition taking place at the Crystal Palace on
October 30 and 31 and November 1. I paid my visit in the
forenoon on the Wednesday.
The collection of foreign birds (there were also British
birds and Canaries) was not a large one, the withdrawal of Mr.
Fulljames from the show bench making a marked difference in
the number of the exhibits. Nevertheless, there was a very nice
little Show, placed in a snug place free from draughts, and part,
but not all, in good light.
Most of the exhibits were humanely caged (I inspected
only the foreign birds, and classes 51 and 53 of the British), but
I must except No. 2 in class 53, a fair Missel Thrush in a
regulation show cage so shallow that it could not but be restless,
and it could not flutter backwards and forwards without bruising
its flights. Can an exhibitor suppose that any judge would
award a prize to a bird in such a condition ! Not only is it
larger, but the Missel Thrush is a much more nervous and rest-
less species than the Song Thrush, and requires a respectable
cage.
A few birds, not marked absent, I could not find ; and an
empty cage was a pathetic epitaph in one instance ; and plurals
in the catalogue were sometimes represented by single specimens.
Let us hope that the latter were but printer's errors, of which
there were sufficient, such as " Lui " for " Tui," " Lanceolated "\0x25A0
for " Liueolated," " Blue-pointed " for " Blue-fronted, etc.

Two absurdities attracted my attention, (i) A pair of
Paradise Whydahs in a cage suitable perhaps for the two birds
in undress, but which the male in full fig. found highly
inconvenient for the decorous handling of his full court train ;
(2) A House Sparrow, which a gentleman with a Scotch name,
presumably from some out of the way place in the Highlands or
Islands, sent up so that we poor Londoners might have a chance
of seeing Passer domeslicus for once in our lives.
The judge (foreign birds) was scarcely happy in some of
his awards.
Amongst the British birds (" Migratory.--Any Variety,"
and " Any other Variety British Bird."), perhaps two fine
Choughs attracted most attention, but one unhappily had injured
his bill. These birds are most diligent hunters after insects in
crevices and under stones on the sea shore, turning the stones
over and groping about amongst them in a most industrious
manner, the long, curved, very fine, narrow bill being specially
adapted for the purpose. Not but what they will accompany the
ploughman like a Rook when unmolested. The injured bird had
evidently been following his instincts in captivity to his own
undoing. A male Chough (the female is often shy and timid)
with semi-liberty makes a grand pet, but is out of place and
thrown away in a cage.
Mr. Maxwell exhibited a superb Wryneck ; but the poor
fellow, standing as bolt upright on his bare perch as a scared
Scops Owl, did look so absurdly conscious of his incongruous
surroundings ! He would have given the best feather in his tail
for twelve inches of apple-tree sprout. A specimen each of the
Greater and Lesser Black-spotted Woodpeckers were interesting,
the latter being not often seen at the Shows. Mr. Maxwell's
Black Redstart was hardly in good form. I failed to see his
Blue-headed Wagtail which took the second prize. More than
once, when visiting a Show in the morning, I have noticed
special birds carried off to a quiet corner in order to be sketched
or painted. This is most unfair, and ought not to be allowed.
We pay our money, come a considerable railway journey, and
put ourselves to much inconvenience in order to see the birds,
and especially the special birds, and no bird should be
moved from its place during show hours except on account of
sickness. I do not say that this particular exhibit had been
removed for the purpose suggested because I do not know. A
good Grey Wagtail was shewn by Mr. Allen. Mr. Wilson had
a nice, though small, Missel Thrush : and a Grasshopper

Warbler (a bird of the year I think) sent by Mr. Sandy, and
a Lesser Whitethroat by Mr. Davison, were not without merit
taking the species into consideration.
Two good Nightingales stirred up the muse in the heart
of a gentleman near, perhaps a foreigner as I had difficulty in
following his speech, who told me (as I understood him) that
Nightingales on migration used to pass over his garden but not
stop there. One year he had a caged Nightingale in his garden ;
and two pairs of wild birds, attracted by the captive, instead of
passing on as in previous years, stopped for the season and
nested with him. Some country gentlemen may like to take
the hint. Mr. Plumbridge's Jay, a good bird but dull of feather,
called out another story. A passenger, passing a caged Jay on
board ship, gave a violent sneeze. On the following day the
gentleman's wife passed the bird, when it likewise began to
sneeze. In truth our Jay, although a poor talker, is a splendid
mimic. One fine Magpie, and another smaller, were also
present.
So far as the foreigners were concerned, not much atten-
tion was paid to the class in which a bird was found. On this
point we can sympathize with Show Managers--so long as the
mistakes are made by mistake, which is not always the case.
But still it was necessary to make just one example, and thus to
uphold the principle of the thing, and accordingly a scapegoat
was found in the person of a Shining Parrakeet--which was not
in its wrong class. But here I can sympathize with the judge
also, who, as indignant as myself, could think of no better way
of inflicting punishment on its owner. I found the poor bird
hanging on by its eyelids to a slippery, ungraduated, much too
large bamboo perch, and afraid to wink for fear it might tumble
off backwards. If it was not the perch that made it look so miser-
able, I can only suppose that it was troubled with a bad " tummy-
ache" when I passed by. Besides, to have accepted the Shining
Parrakeet would have been to have condemned Mr. Sutton's two
excellent Fijians which were in another class. And so it came to
pass that Mr. Sutton was rewarded with second and third prizes
for sending up two good birds, and Mr. Cole condemned in costs
and a Wg. Cl. for sending up a less excellent example :--really
an admirable system to work upon.
In class 55 there were but five exhibits, amongst which
were distributed four prizes and a V.H.C. This is reducing prize-
giving to an absurdity. Might not some kind of sliding scale be
arranged, so that the number of prizes might bear some pro-

portion to the number of entries, or of cages present on the
judging day? To make the matter more ridiculous in this case,
the first prize was awarded to a bird which had no business in
the class, for a Ritieolated Parrakeet is not a Pigmy Parrot.
Although not exactly common in this country, for there is little
demand for it, it is not a rare species; and this bird at its best
could not have been a first class specimen :---when I passed it, it
appeared to be approaching its worst. In this class there seemed
to be a good pair of Rosy Rovebirds, but I could hardly see
them in their dark but otherwise comfortable cage. The rest of
the class was filled up with Budgerigars.
Mr. Re Grace exhibited a couple of good Tui Parrakeets,
a most engaging species to my mind. An old male we have had
for some years will sit just out of my reach, and mock, and
cheek, and almost make faces at me like some impudent young
scamp who knows his parents are too effeminate to give him the
walloping he so richly deserves. But when a good boy, or
in any trouble, he will come on to my little finger, the only one
he can comfortably grasp with his tiny paws, and allow us to
kiss and caress him as placidly as if he were a kitten, puppy, or
baby. I tried very hard to persuade myself that Mr. Re Grace's
birds were a pair, but was not successful. A very good female
Golden-shouldered Parrakeet was shewn by Mr. Hawkins;
probably it was the rarest bird in the Show.
The Rories and Rorikeets had but one representative
between them. Mr. Maxwell's Scaly-breasted Rorikeet was a very
lively healthy bird, but in unusually poor colour. From what I
know of the species, I feel inclined to associate this loss of
colour with moulting on seed ; and this bird had nothing but
seed in its cage when I saw it. One would like to know
something more of its history. Mrs. Doherty exhibited a nice
Red-winged Parrakeet, and another was sent up by Mr. Sutton.
Mr. Hawkins' Turquoisiue seemed to be in good feather ; but
Mr. Housden's excellent pair of Pennants and Mr. Maxwell's
well knowm Hawk-lieaded Parrot seemed a trifle stale. A very
lively White-browed Amazon, owned by Mrs. Cooper, helped to
cheer up its companions; but it should not have been ignored
by the judge just because it was a little woman in female attire
but, alas, it also had a woman's tongue, so of course he passed
it with all speed.
One lady valued her very ordinary-looking Blue-fronted
Amazon at ^500 (so the catalogue) ; but the judge did not
notice the bird, which of course shewed very bad taste on the
</bodyText>
<page confidence="0.998201" page_id="10098557"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.989266418604651" page_id="10098557"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
part of the judge. This is supposed to have shamed the lady so
much that I was told she tore the price off the label. Or did the
bird, with a more modest idea of its own value, itself gnaw it off!
Mr. Housdeu had a good female Ganga and a capital pair of
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, and Mrs. Cooper had a fair male
Leadbeater.
Cast but hardly least come the three Fijian Parrakeets, to
which I have already indirectly alluded. On previous occasions
we have had examples of two, but not I think of three, different
species of these large but, in captivity, not very interesting birds.
Exhibitions are of great value to aviculturists, as by them they
are enabled to see and compare species which otherwise would
be beyond their reach ; and I must be forgiven if I let out at
those who by thoughtlessness bring the Shows into disrepute.
I made out Mr. Sutton's second-prize bird to be a Tabuan
Parrakeet, Pyrrhulopsis tabnensis, his other bird a Masked
Parrakeet, P. personata, and Mr. Cole's to be, as catalogued, a
Shining Parrakeet, P. splendens.
Most of the foreigners other than Parrots were most pro-
perly placed in cages with wooden backs, which caused some
of them to be so much in the shade that I could hardly make
them out, much less observe their points. For instance, Mr.
Hawkins' pair of Rufous-tailed Finches, which took the first prize
in the open class for Waxbills,Whydahs, etc., looked to me much
like two males. To this class Mr. Hawkins sent also a Red-faced,
an Aurora, and a pair of Pectoral Finches. Mr. Glasscoe had a
pair of what seemed to be Golden-fronted Weavers, and a
Yellow-backed Whydah ; Mrs. Cooper a Red-headed Weaver
and a pair of Magpie Mannikins ; and. Mr. Townsend a pair
of Zebra Waxbills. What seemed to be a pair of ordinary
Combasous were catalogued as " Paradise Whydah (E. African
variety)."
My first sight of the next class was enough to break the
heart of a wheelbarrow, much more so mine, for I am very fond
of the Parrot Finches. A solitary specimen seemed to be deeply
lamenting a lost one, and a hybrid (Vol. VI., p. 136) next to it
was likewise alone, although the catalogue speaks of " finches,"
and the only Report on the Show I have seen refers to both as
"pairs"; the pair of Tricoloured had vanished, taking their
cage with them ; while a 2nd prize Parrot Finch in the Eimit
Class was represented by a tenantless cage. It is impossible to
help liking these little fellows, but they are not over robust. All
these birds belonged to Mr. Hawkins (who took the whole of the

<bodyText confidence="0.998103232558139" page_id="10098558"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
money in this class), and also a lovely pair of Beautiful and a good
pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches, and a rather lumpy female Cuba
Finch. Mrs. Gill exhibited a pair of Passerine Doves and
another of Chinese Quails. There were also in the class several
foreign Goldfinches, a good pair of Zebras, and a Green Singing-
finch. I did not see any of Mr. H. B. Smith's cages in this or
any other class.
The first prize in the Insectivorous, Any Variety, Class
was taken by Mr. Glasscoe's excellent Masked Wood-Swallow,
which looked as much like a fish out of water as the Wryneck;
but his Blue-cheeked Barbet, a fine male in rather poor colour,
looked as impudent as you like, and from his very cheeky look
attracted the attention of several visitors. This species lives on
fruit and berries ; but the bird had to be shoved either into this
or the class for seed-eaters. The two Zosterops sent up by the
same gentleman, of different species as I believe, were caged
together, and properly passed by the Judge. Mr. Townsend
carried off the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th prizes with his Tanagers--Blue
and Black, and Blue-headed. He had also a Black Tauager.
I11 the Limit Class, Mr. Hawkins came first with a first-
class male Rufous-tailed Finch, and third with a fair pair of
Bicheno's, and fourth with a pair of Lavenders. He and other
exhibitors had likewise several birds of no particular merit, but
I must except Mr. Housdeu's Dominicans, which looked like
good birds.
As regards the Lavender Finches, the female was of the
light colour which in recent years we have been taught to believe
denotes the female, but which it seems to me denotes only
immaturity of either sex. For some years past I have been
trying to obtain an undoubted female ; but all the light coloured
warranted females have turned as black as Crows when fully
adult. I fear that the females, being the more delicate, rarely
survive, and that most of the Lavenders we meet with are males.
The nearest approach to a female which I have been able to
obtain is now as black about the hind quarters as its mate; but
it is worthy of note that when it is handled twice a year on the
occasions of its transfers between its winter and summer abodes
it is found that it never has any flank spots, which the male as
often possesses. The light coloured flank theory took its origin
from a drawing which Mr. Abrahams caused to be made of an
example in his possession which a post mortem examination
proved to be a female ; but I strongly suspect that if the bird
had lived it would have turned as black as the others. I think

27
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994445" page_id="10098559"  page_num="27" year="" vol="">
that it is the slightly lighter colour of the general plumage, but
especially of the fore rather than the hind parts, that indicates
the female. These very light coloured examples are simply
immature. I hesitate to express an opinion in respedt of the
flank spot. I make these statements not for the purpose of
dogmatising but of inviting discussion.
One more digression, started by Mr. Hawkins' Long-
tailed Grassfinches, and then I have done.
Last October, Mr. Seth-Smith drew attention to the vary-
ing colour of the bills of this species, and says (p. 258), " I have
sometimes thought there must be two distinct forms." In
November (p. 19), Miss Hodgson supported this view on the
authority of a German avicultural paper. I have myself kept the
species continuously since 4th May, 1897, and have found over
and over again that the normal colour of the bills of my birds is
of the yellow type, but that they assume the red (I use the
expressions red and yellow, although not strictly accurate, for
the sake of convenience) as the nesting season approaches. The
colour of the bill will completely change from the yellow to the
red in a few days. Strong vigorous males, especially if kept in the
warm, will retain the red bill for months, while I have known a
female adopt and lose the red in less than a fortnight. I notice
too that, as my birds grow older and lose vigour, they have less
of the red. Mr. Seth-Smith has found that the Yellow Bills have
the longest tails. If my birds are anything, I feel inclined to
say that they are Yellow Bills, but never have I had such a tail as
we see repeatedly at the Shows. Now my birds for the most
part have had to rough it in my open, exposed aviary during a
great part of the year, and have had but very moderate warmth
during the winter. I have not treated them thus because I
consider them hardy, but because I have nothing better to offer
them. If I could, I would follow Mr. Todd's example (Vol. III.,
p. 210) ; and it was Mr. Todd who first and so quickly reared the
species. I totally disagree with those who tell us that the species
is hardy. The Long Tail is a strong bird, and will stand a great
deal for a time, but is none the less greatly affected by cold.
Occasionally I have kept a pair of these birds in a warmer place ;
and I look back and find I have recorded how these latter have
become prettier and prettier, and have acquired a bloom on their
feathers which is never seen on the others, and which with these
is lost as soon as they are turned loose. When I regard the
beautiful condition of many exhibited specimens, sometimes
Yellow Bills but oftener Red, I can see at a glance that they have
been kept under totally different conditions from my own. I

have repeatedly found, with birds generally but especially
foreigners, that it is the protected specimens, and those kept in
the warm, that have the glorious bloom and softness and rich-
ness of colour which one sometimes beholds. It seems to me,
too, that this species would be rather sensitive to artificial
treatment. Moreover, as regards the tails, as I observed years
ago in the Shama, birds kept in the warm will undoubtedly
throw out longer tails than will those which live in the open
aviary. Altogether I think the case non proven, and that we
should do well to suspend judgment for a while; and in the
meantime perhaps some of the gentlemen who exhibit these
beautiful specimens may be willing to give us their views on the
subjedt. Am I far wrong in suggesting that in the Parson and
Long-tailed Grassfinches we have an example of a species sub-
dividing into two distiudt species or sub-species ? The specimens
of the original parent which found their way North (or vice versa
as the case may have been) seem to have developed into the
magnificent Long Tails under the influence of a tropical climate,
while those going South have degenerated into the stunted-
tailed Parson.
Mr. Hawkins' Long Tails were good, with red bills, but
not so good as others I have seen. They were an undoubted
pair, and that brings us to another point. The female and only
the female of this and of other undoubted pairs exhibited from
time to time, so far as I could see, had the white mark at the tip of
the two outer feathers on each side of the tail. Only quite
recently I have noticed that it is stated in the Museum Catalogue
of Birds, at page 376 of Vol. XIII., that the young of this species
have " all but the centre tail-feathers broadly tipped with white." I
have never seen any but the two outer on each side tipped or
touched with white, for the form that the white mark takes differs
considerably at different times even in the same bird. But be
this as it may, the Catalogue is inaccurate in inferring that only
the 3 7 oung have the white tips, for my two old females have the
white tips now as plainly marked as when I first noticed the
peculiarity. I have had two adult males and three adult females ;
the latter have always had the marks, the males never. Of my
three hybrids referred to by Mr. Setli-Smith, I examined them
on October 22, and then two were strongly marked while the
other, the best of the lot and apparently a male, had a faint
touch of white on only one feather. They have all three
adopted the long tails of the mother ; but somehow their
general appearance and movements are those of the Parson Finch,
and also the call notes. Their bills have slightly changed colour.

By Iv. W. Hawkins.
Some account of my breeding experiences this year may
be of interest.
My aviary consists of a span-roofed building, one half of
the roof being covered with boards and zinc, while the other half
facing south is entirely glazed. The walls are double-boarded
and have a window. The floor is concrete. A large portion of
the space is enclosed with straight wire as a breeding aviary, and
includes a loft 16 feet long. Here live in perfect harmony
several pairs of seed-eating birds,each pair belonging to a separate
species. Perhaps the most charming of these are the little Cuba-
finches, Phoyiipara canora. Their appearance is very pleasing,
but their chief attractions are their cheerful nature and continual
twitter.
My pair came into my possession in January this year. In
April they built a nest iu a cocoanut husk, swinging on the roof
near the highest part. The nest was composed of dried grass
and feathers, and completely lined the husk, the entrance, how-
ever, being left quite free, so that it was easy to see into the nest.
Four eggs were laid 011 as many consecutive days, and were white
in colour, densely sprinkled on the larger ends with light brown
marks. The hen sat alone during the day, and at night both sat
together. Things went on satisfactorily for about a week, when
the increased heat of the sun on the glass roof made it necessary
to draw down the outside sun blind for the first time this year.
The result was disastrous, for the Cuba-fiuches at once deserted
their eggs, and nothing would induce them to return to them.
It was very disappointing, as all four eggs appeared to be fertile.
However, the little birds evidently became accustomed to the
pulling down of the sun blind, for, about a mouth later, another
four eggs were laid in the same nest as before. This timethesitting
was more successful, for 011 June 14th one young bird was
hatched out alive and well. Two of the eggs-were thrown out
of the nest and found broken, with young birds dead inside. The
remaining egg also contained a dead bird. The young bird
thrived and grew day by day, till it left the nest on July 2nd.
When first hatched it appeared quite bare, no down at all being
visible. The beak had a thick yellow edge, and the inside of the
mouth was red. When it left the nest, it resembled the mother
very closely. The yellow collar was very evident, but the upper
throat was still bare. Both parents were at first very attentive,

constantly feeding it from their crops. I was, however, again to
be disappointed. On July 8th, I noticed the young Cuba was
too weak to leave the ground, and, thinking to save it, I picked
it up and placed it in the nest. The parents immediately flew to
the nest, and the male appeared terribly excited, flying into it with
great force, and seemed to be trying to kill his offspring instead
of feeding it. I believe his intentions were indeed murderous,
for shortly afterwards the poor young bird again fluttered to the
ground weaker than before. I then tried to feed it by hand. It
took yolk of egg off a straw, but next morning it was dead. The
day after this, July ioth, I was surprised to find an egg in the
Cuba-finches' nest. They had commenced to breed again before
the young one could feed itself, and consequently had deserted
it. The batch of eggs this time consisted of three only, one
of which disappeared during the sitting, and I never found it
again. On July 26th, one young bird was hatched, and the third
egg was found to be clear. This time I was determined, if
possible, to prevent the parents breeding again until the young
one could take care of itself. I accordingly put the nest and
young one into a cage, and securing the parents placed them
with it. All went well, and as soon as the young one left the
nest on August nth, I removed the nest. This time I was
rewarded with success, and the young Cuba-finch now takes full
charge of itself. It is a hen and could scarcely be distinguished
from its mother, when only about six weeks old. I put the
parents and the same nest back into the breeding aviary 011
August 30th, and, on September 3rd, the first egg of another
batch of three eggs was laid, which however came to nothing.
I cannot find any record of Phonipara ca?iora having been
bred in Britain before. The allied species Phonipara lepida has,
I am told, been bred this year by a gentleman in Scotland, two
males and a female being successfully reared (a).
The Double-banded Finches have proved very prolific with
me. My pair made a cup-sliaped nest inside a cocoanut husk,
hanging high up on the wirework side of the aviary. The
materials used were hay and a few feathers. Here they succeeded
in bringing up three broods of two, four, and three young ones,
respectively, and they are now sitting again. In addition to
those mentioned, I have two more young birds from the same
(a). I think these three young birds (from Dundee ?) came into my hands, but they
seem to be adopting the plumage of P. pusilla rather than of P. lepida. The song, how-
ever, of the surviving male (the other died from the effects of the journey) is totally
different. My old female Pusilla (Vol. VI. p. 239) took to them, and they to her, at sight,
the old widow mothering and feeding the young as if they had been her own--R.P.

parents, hatched and reared by my Zebra-finches. These eggs
were laid after the hen had been sitting on her first batch of eggs
about a week, and were, of course, unhatched when her first two
young ones appeared. I transferred them at once to the Zebra-
finches, who were then sitting on eggs of their own in a cocoanut
shell suspended in a cage. They brought up two young Zebra
cocks and the two young Double-banded Finches together.
When the young leave the nest they look like the parents, but
the two bands are not so distinct, and the white parts are very
dirty looking. When about three months old, however, they are
not to be distinguished from the parents (#).
Last year I was rather successful in breedingthe Long-tailed
Grassfinches, but this year they do not seem to have managed so
well. They have sat on four batches of eggs, two of which were
complete failures, noeggs hatching at all. Once twoyoungones left
the nest, but died a week later, apparently of starvation. On the
last occasion two birds were hatched, one of which grew much
less rapidly than the other, and finally died in the nest. The
other is the only one reared this year. They build their nest
sometimes in a German canary cage, and sometimes in a
mahogany nest box hanging on the wall. My pair have red
beaks, but a large number have yellow beaks. I have heard it
stated that the difference is due to the age of the bird, the beak
only turning red after a certain age. I have also been told that
it is the aviary-bred specimens alone that have yellow beaks. I
can only say that I have kept Yellow-beaked Longtails over two
years without any change in colour, and that the beaks of my
aviary-bred birds, from Red-beaked parents, have invariably
turned directly from black to red. I assume, therefore, that there
are two varieties.
The African Fire-finch is a bird with a strong inclination
to breed. The great difficulty is to get it acclimatised. I bought
four pairs last January, of which two pairs aud a cock died
within a fortnight. The surviving pair and odd hen are still in
my possession. The pair have nested three times. The first
time they lined a cocoanut shell on the wall with hay and
feathers. They had three eggs and sat well, but all the eggs
were clear. The second time they selected a cocoanut shell on
the roof. This time they had four eggs from which three young
were successfully reared. The third time they built a nest in a
(#.) This year I have fully reared five, in three batches ; and others lived to leave the
nest, but perished in the cold and wet. I find the elder ones may be distinguished from
the adults by the narrow breast-band. The narrow breast-band is a sign of youth, not of
sex as suggested by some aviculturists.--K.P

German canary cage, and from four eggs reared two young ones.
The young Fire-finches, when just hatched, are rather pretty to
look at when opening their mouths. The roofs of their mouths
have black spots, and at each corner of the mouth are two milk
white glands with a deep blue spot between them. When they
leave the nest both sexes are brown. The cock sits alternately
with the hen in the day time. At night they both sit together.
A pair of Masked Grassfinches, Poephila personata, have
just (October 25th) succeeded in rearing five healthy young ones
in my aviary. The parents have been in my possession about
two years, and have made several attemps to breed, but up till
now with no success. They seem very nervous birds and fly
from the nest on the slighest alarm, and it is a very long time
before they will return. The nests have always been made of
very loose hay in a German canary cage, hanging high up 011
the wall. The shape is globular, with a very small entrance. On
two or three occasions all the young birds have been found dead
in the eggs. Once they hatched two young ones, but the hay of
the nest was so loose that the young birds and the remaining
eggs would sink and get lost in the hay. The little birds only
lived a few hours.
Finding they had laid again last August, I removed the
nest and put in its place another German canary cage, in which
a pair of Parrot-finches had built a much more substantial nest.
Into this I transferred the eggs which this time were six in
number, though previously the number had always been five.
The birds did not appear to notice the difference. Care was
taken to leave the birds as undisturbed as possible, and on
September 4th, five young birds were found in the nest, the sixth
egg which was also fertile being found on the floor. The period
of incubation was about sixteen days.
When first hatched, the young birds are very like young
Long-tailed Grassfinches, but the marks on the palate are more
distinct. On September 27th, all the five birds left the nest fully
fledged. The colours are the same as in the parents but duller,
the beaks, however, being black and the feet grey.
I11 my experience the Masked Grassfinch is a hardier bird
than the White-eared Grassfinch. One pair of the former have
outlived three pairs of the latter. The sexes are very much alike,
but when seen together I have always been able to distinguish
them. The breast of the hen is a decided shade lighter, and the
portion of the mask under the beak a trifle smaller.
Three pairs of birds have produced batches of eggs, but

failed to hatch them. These are the Rufous-tailed Finches,
Gouldian-finches, and the Red-faced-finch mated with a Cock
Aurora finch. The Parrot-finches have made several nests, but
never laid an egg.
All the eggs laid by my birds, except those of the Cuba-
finch, have been white in colour.

No doubt other aviculturists besides myself, who have
visited the Exhibition this year, have been equally disap-
pointed that their especial hobby has no place allotted to it
among the exhibits, although everything else imaginable seems
to be well represented. I had expected to find exhibits in
aviaries and all appliances for the same ; but, although I have
paid innumerable visits to all parts of the Exhibition during the
past few months, I have failed to find any, although it is possible
that in some out-of-the-way corner such may exist.
One day recently I was tempted to visit the dreary Annex
of Vincennes, away on the other side of Paris, where unlimited
space is given up to all the exhibits which were crowded out of
the Exhibition proper, by reading in the papers that one of the
most interesting departments there was that devoted to " Avicul-
ture." As not one out of every five hundred or more visitors to
Paris troubles to go there, or perhaps knows that such an Annex
exists, I thought I had a treat in store, and could perhaps find
something interesting to write about for the "Avicultural Magazine"
for the benefit of those who have not been able to visit the show.
I chose an unfortunate day, for by the time I arrived there the
rain came down in a deluge, and with no hopes of it clearing
up. Guided by numerous sign-posts at the corners of all the
paths, I picked my way through a sea of mud and water to the
fenced-in part given up to " Aviculture." On arriving there I
found it was another of the numerous " extras " of the
Exhibition, with a charge of 25 centimes entrance fee, which I
gladly paid if only to get under shelter until the rain ceased. I
see by the tickets that the price had originally been fixed at one
franc ; but like everything else connected with this gigantic
show and failure, all prices have had to come down to less than
the half at first conceived by those who expected to make a
fortune over it. On nearing my goal I was half prepared for a
disappointment by hearing much crowing, cackling, and quack-

ing, which suggested more of the farmyard than aviculture, but
I was not prepared to find it given up solely to poultry, rabbits
and guinea pigs, the only exception being three very miserable
deer, having as companions in their enclosure some wild ducks,
and a few dilapidated golden pheasants. If the scope of this
Magazine were extended, as some wish it to be, those members
might have been interested to have heard more of these exhibits.
As it was, the only thing dealing with cage birds was a gorgeous
large drawing-room aviary in the shape of a house, with all the
horrors of winding staircases, stained - glass windows, and
artificial plants on the balconies, &amp;c. This was in the Secre-
tary's office, where I also found samples of every known kind of
trap and means of catching animals and birds from a lion down
to a mouse, and the largest hawks to the smallest finches. The
French seem to excel in these inventions, although I see they
call many of these--" pi^ges anglais," and " ratieres anglaises,"
&amp;c., but for such unsportsmanlike inventions as " grains
diaboliques," and " Pilules du Diable," which figure on one list
I had handed to me, I hope they take the full and sole credit of
inventing and using.
Although there is no part dealing specially with cage birds
in the Exhibition, there are, nevertheless, many exhibits of
interest to the naturalist and aviculturist in the wa)&apos; of stuffed
specimens and cabinet skins, scattered through the Pavilions on
the Champ de Mars and also in a few of the buildings on the Rue
des Nations. In this class Canada undoubtedly stands first, both in
quantity and quality, and has a room given up entirely to her
fauna. One could wish, though, that they were classified, and
arranged better, and less crowded together. There are many
rare and interesting birds among the exhibits, and some of the
sea birds especially, are really well put up. I have found them
sufficiently interesting to visit several times. Most of the French
Colonies send collections of skins also, but without a single
exception they are all of the commonest species, and have
evidently been chosen only for their colours, and on the whole
they form one of the saddest and most dilapidated sights in the
Exhibition. Those that are mounted (generally on a large
artificial tree in the centre of a room) bear little or no re-
semblance whatever to the living birds ; and the unmounted
skins are all nailed on the walls ruffled, shapeless, flattened out
and covered with dust. This is especially the case with the
Madagascar exhibits, although there are also one or two cases of
fairly well put up skins from that Island. Martinique exhibits

skins of humming birds which never come from that Island at
all, nor from any other West Indian island either. Of the French
possessions, Tunis makes the best show, although they are
arranged in such a dark corner of the Official Pavilion that it is
difficult to see the majority of the birds properly.
In the Rue des Nations, Portugal has a good show of
mounted birds, but principally shore birds, and Bosnia and
Herzegovina also have a few interesting specimens. In this
part of the grounds, however, Mexico stands far and away above
all other countries. It is much to be regretted that this hand-
some building is so badly lighted, and many of the birds in such
a dark alcove that it is all but impossible to distinguish birds
from mammals. Those in the centre of the building can be
seen to much better advantage, and for me possess the greatest
interest, as most of the birds belong to families so well represented
in Ecuador ; in fact many of the species vary only slightly from
the Ecuadorian ones. Among them I noticed that the Mexican
form of Yellow-bellied Grosbeak ( c ) is very much larger than the
Ecuadorian one, and not so brilliant, otherwise I could see no
difference. I omitted to mention when writing of this bird that
it is subspecifically separated under the name of Pheucticus
chrysopeplus chrysogaster. Among the many handsome birds
exhibited is a lovely pair of Xanthura luctuosa and also some
fine Tanagers. There is also a wonderful and very large collec-
tion of Lepidoptera coleoptera (all beautifully set), and land shells.
In the Palace of Forests and Chase are numerous exhibits
whichcannotfail to interest aviculturists, although they do not con-
cern them particularly. There the leading Paris taxidermists are
well represented, and I noticed some rare Colombian birds among
the exhibits of one well-known firm. A sight in this building
which no one interested in birds could fail to think sad is in the
Japanese section, which is taken up almost entirely by boxes of
birds' skins of every known species from that country, exhibited
with a view to obtaining orders for their wholesale exportation ;
which is quite a different thing to legitimate and limited collect-
ing for scientific purposes. I understand that great numbers were
sent to England in the early Spring of this year, to some auction
rooms, where they were sold by the thousand for a mere song.
Some of the daily papers had a deal to say about it at the time,
and it was hoped that the absurdly low prices they fetched
would discourage the trade as far as England was concerned.
Perhaps here in Paris they may find a larger demand for them,

where feathers and skins are " faked up " in a marvellous
manner for millinery purposes. There must be very many
thousands of them in the present exhibition, for the boxes of
small birds contain at least a hundred skins each, and include
even canaries and the little Bengalese. Like everything else
which comes from that country, they are the perfection of neat-
ness in the way they are put up, and even down to the boxes
they are packed in. Every skin appears to be perfect, with not
a feather out of place, but all have that cjdiudrical form peculiar
to the Japanese prepared skins, caused by putting them in a
paper band before the skin is dry. A cap of fine rice paper is
also neatly folded over the head, with a small opening cut for the
bill to pass through. In each box a few are left unwrapped to
show the species. One cannot help thinking that, if this trade
is continued, Japan at no distant date will be quite denuded of
birds ; and she will find out her mistake when it is too late. I
am sure no one could more regret it than themselves, for the
Japanese are really fond of birds, and seem to understand the
treatment each kind requires in captivity much better than most
people do in England, and I have often thought we might go to
them for wrinkles.
Ecuador has a pretty little pavilion at the foot of the
Eiffel Tower, and might have sent an interesting collection of
bird skins, but I was prepared for disappointment there, as when
I was in the country last year I knew the Government was not
troubling itself much in that direction. No other country could
have sent so large and interesting a collection of humming birds
alone. The few badly mounted ones, in a large case of mixed
birds occupying the centre of the ground floor, are the commonest
ones to be found in the country, and they are so very badly put
up that it is difficult for one who knows them in life to recognise
them at all. The case also contains some of the long-tailed
Resplendent Trogons, which of course are not found in Ecuador.
I hope that no one who has seen the collection will for a moment
imagine that in life the beautiful Cocks of the Rocks (R.
sanguinolcntci) in the least resemble in shape and attitude those
that are mounted there. I see I did not mention these birds in
my Notes on Ecuador, and I don't suppose any member of the
Society has had a chance of keeping any of the species alive,
which is a pity, as I know for a fact that perhaps few birds are
hardier or so easy to keep. The blood-coloured one is by far the
handsomest, then the R. pemviana, from Eastern Ecuador, and
lastly the R. crocea, from Guiana, which is also the smallest.

With the exception of a few birds chiefly from the
&apos;Caucasus, exhibited in the Russian building by the Trocadero
Palace, these seem to me to be the only items of special interest
in the Exhibition to those who are fond of studying Natural
History.
I have been continually surprised to see the numbers of
people who take an interest in the bird exhibits, when there are
so many marvels to occupy their attention in other directions,
and people whom one would hardly suppose would glance at
such things : )&apos; , et if there is a case of birds in a room, I have
often found it difficult to get near it.
I wonder if any other visitor to the Exhibition has
remarked the number of Blackbirds to be seen about the grounds
in spite of all the noise, bustle, and the hundreds of thousands
of visitors which daily crowd the grounds. I have sometimes
counted eight or nine in the course of an hour, mostly around
the Trocadero, but also in the trees close up to the Palace of
Electricity.

HOW TO KEEP SMALL FOREIGN BIRDS OUT

By Wesley T. Page, F.Z.S.
In writing this paper I am not questioning Mr. Wiener's
methods in the least. For the indoor aviary they cannot be gain-
said ; but it is very probable there are many, like myself, who are
compelled to keep their birds out of doors all the year round ;
and if say Waxbills, etc., could be kept only under the conditions
stated, it would be a real deprivation to many, because of their
lack of indoor accommodation. For myself there are few birds I
would keep in the average box cage, even though they appear
fairly contented and keep in good condition ; for the data
gathered together under such conditions can be of but little
value.
In my garden aviary, among a mixed collection, there are
usually about twenty Waxbills, my losses among them in four
years having been about four ; and these have taken place during
the very hot weather and before the commencement of the
autumnal moult. My aviary is simply a lean-to shed, 14ft. by
6ft. by 8ft., boarded on three sides, covered with Mn. mesh wire-
netting in front, and has an open flight at one end. It faces almost
full south ; from N. and E. winds it is wholly sheltered, and
partially from the W. also. This is all the shelter they get, no

matter how severe the weather; I never make use of blinds or
shutters in any form whatever ; and though I am aware a few of
our members will possibly exclaim in horror at my cruelty as
they read this, I certainly am not conscious of its existence ; and
I will never believe that birds which sing, bathe, and are blithe
and gay all the day long can be either miserable or suffering.
The Waxbills of which I am writing are, briefly :

They have for companions a fairly representative series of the
genus Afunia, a sprinkling of Grassfinches, a few of the Emberiza ,
and a pair of Cockatiels.
I venture to say that, if members were to compare notes, it
would be found that those keeping their birds in out door aviaries
suffer by far the smallest number of losses ; again, the indoor
aviaries are by no means free from epidemics, as some avicul-
turalists know to their cost.
I will now quote an instance of one day last winter, when
it was necessary to break the ice in the bath three times during the
day ; Sporceginthus amandava , A. subflavus and A. melpodus , so
soon as the ice was broken (i.e. three times), went in, had their
tub, then away into the branches to preen their feathers ; between
times they were on the wing continuously, trilling their sweet and
merry little lay, as happy--well as a bird could be.
They have the usual seeds, soft food, and generally
manage to secure one meal worm daily from th o. Emberiza ; when
obtainable they also get grass in flower; they must have sand
and also cuttle-fish bone.
Simple as it seems this is about all that is required.
Under such conditions the birds will thrive and charm the
aviarist by their happy and contented demeanour and quaint
entertaining birdy ways.
Wholly insectivorous and frugivorous birds can only in
most instances be kept indoors, though I believe our fellow
member, the Rev. C. D. Farrar, has succeeded in keeping and
breeding several of these entirely out of doors.
My locality is Shepherd's Bush, Loudon ; in spite of the
fogs we have to endure I have never supplied artificial light ;

though from observations made in friends' indoor aviaries and
cages, artificial light during our long winter nights is a sine qua
non of the indoor aviary ( d ).
In conclusion, my ideal of a garden aviary is simply to net
in as large a space as possible, and to stand inside one or two
shelters after the style of the rustic summer-houses now so
common in the market; and to closely plant the other portion
with a few evergreens and deciduous plants, such as box, arbor
vitae, bush forms of willow, poplar and cheap fruit trees ( e ), with
a few blackberry brambles, filling up the spaces with sowings of
tall growing grasses and cereals ( e ). I am unable to give details for
this year as 1 was taken ill last Xmas eve, and am still too weak
for business ; so mv birds have been left to the care of others
and have simply existed, but I cannot grumble : only five have
died including two of the aforementioned Waxbills (/).

THE WHITE-BREASTED KINGFISHER IN CAPTIVITY.

From " Bombay Natural History Society&apos;s Jojirtial,&amp;quot; 29 th July , 1900.
Although in no part of the world can the Kingfisher be
said to be a common cage-bird, on account of the difficulty in
catering for its appetite ; yet anyone who really values gorgeous
colours in a bird can, with very little more trouble than is
ordinarily bestowed upon an insectivorous bird, keep the King-
fisher in perfect health and plumage.
The first two White-breasted Kingfishers which I reared
were fed entirely upon pieces of fish, cut up to about half the
size of a hazel-nut; also, on small whole fish when procurable,
alive or dead. These birds were procured when just ready to
leave the nest, and kept in good health for four months, when
I presented them to the Calcutta Zoological Gardens. That was
(&lt;/) I do not agree with Mr. Page that artificial light is indispensable for indoor aviaries
in Winter ; I never supply it ; yet I have reared Zebra-finches at Christmas time. If new-
born birds can pass through the long&apos; nights without food, undoubtedly adults can do so.
Moreover, years ago, I tried turning a light upon the seed-hoppers in my bird-room for an
hour or so, but hardly a bird took advantage of it.--A.G.B.
( e ) Some may say these will be destroyed at once; not if the aviarist suits the
number of birds to the space, or space to the birds.--W.T.P.
( e ) For more than a dozen years, I have had several currant bushes in my garden
aviary : but beyond destroying the flower the birds do them but little harm. I think the
redcu-rrant bushes do the best.--R.P.
(/) This may answer in London but it certainly would not do in exposed situations in
the country in Winter, except for very hardy species. --D. S.-S.

in 1897, and they were the first specimens the Zoological Gardens
ever had.
The London Zoological Gardens, however, purchased a
single specimen as long ago as 1SS4. Unfortunately a civet cat
killed the two birds at the Calcutta Zoo a few days after their
arrival.
Last summer, having obtained another White-breasted
Kingfisher, I determined to adopt a different method of feeding
it. Small pieces of raw lean meat were pushed down the bird's
throat, until, in a day or two, it took the meat of its own accord.
This meat diet was varied with pieces of fish, the bird always
striking its food (as it would have done a live fish) upon its perch
three or four times before swallowing it. This was done with a
jerking movement of the whole body. Lizards, slumps and grass-
hoppers are greedily accepted as dainty morsels by this bird.
Although I have had the bird about nine months, yet I have
never seen it drink. Its meat and fish are always placed in a jar
containing three or four inches of water, into which it plunges
its massive beak to take out its food. I might also add that the
bird sometimes immerses its beak in the water, instantly with-
drawing it with a shake of the head, even when not feeding.
For some weeks the Kingfisher was kept in an aviary
containing a number of other birds, such as mini vets, white-bellied
drongos, black-headed orioles, golden-backed woodpeckers, &amp;c.,
with all of which it agreed perfectly; but owing to the fact that
other birds used to eat any meat or fish scattered by the King-
fisher, and as this upset their digestions, I had to remove the
latter bird to a separate cage.
It greets me with a faint cry accompanied by other signs
of pleasure when I offer it any food. It is tame enough to sit
upon my finger; but, in the presence of strangers at close quarters,
evinces a certain amount of fear. The bird's plumage is perfect,
and quite as bright as that of a wild bird. Mr. F. Finn, B. A.,
A. Z. S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum, w'ho saw
the bird, said, " It is a distinct triumph." The bird is extremely
fond of bathing, as might be expected. When I think it requires
a bath, I stand the cage in a tub of water a foot deep, removing
the lower perch of the cage. It plunges in head first, sometimes
a dozen times in as many minutes. The ejection of pellets of
fish-bones and other indigestible matter is preceded by a few
minutes' gaping and straining. The average weight of food eaten
in one day is if ounces, or equivalent to about 21 minnows.
Since the above has been published, the Kingfisher referred to has
been presented to the Zoological Gardens, Calcutta.--E.W.H.

NOTES on BREEDING the MADAGASCAR LOVE BIRD,

AND OTHER BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.99375025" page_id="10098596"  page_num="41" year="" vol="">
gascar Love bird in the Magazine. I suppose the fact is not
worth recording, the birds are so common and, according to
some authorities, " easily breed." That they are both common
and cheap, I fully agree with ; as to being easy to breed, I am
quite of an opposite opinion. I have kept them for years, and,
until this season, have never been able to rear any. However,
at last I have been fortunate enough to have a fine nest of four
come off, and under rather remarkable and unusual conditions,
too. I had fully decided the hen was dead, not having seen her
for weeks (seven or eight, I believe) ; and the cock, the unfaithful
little wretch, had forsaken her early in the Spring, and taken up
with a hen Bluewing, since which I have not seen him pay the
Madagascar the slightest attention ; so how she has arranged
matters, to rear them by herself, and at the same time to keep
out of sight, is a mystery.
Among other birds that have bred with me this season is
my old pair of Mealy Rosellas. Other years one nest has
sufficed, though this year they have gone one better, and had
two. Certainly the first clutch proved clear, but they made
amends in the second by rearing three grand youngters. Hitherto
they have never had more than two eggs per nest.
Another season, I hope to be able to record a nest of Blue
Bonnets. Of Cutthroats, Zebras, etc., I have quite a flock : with
me they breed like the proverbial mouse. I have had several
nests of Double-banded Finches, not reared ; only the other day
I found two newly-hatched young thrown out of a nest. My
Parrot Finches have all proved cocks; it is ver}' disappointing,
after one buys several birds, thinking you are bound to have a
pair out of the lot, to find them all of one sex.
I had hopes of having a nest of Woodlarks last Spring.
The hen made a nest in a slight depression under one of the
bushes in the outer aviary, but that terrible scourge to avi-
culturists, egg-binding, put a stop to all further proceedings on
her part in that direction.
Like the Parrot-finches, my Diamond Doves are all males.

year or two. We fanciers here have had to take what we can
get, and often what we do get is what we don't want. Many of
ns don't even have the pleasure of a first visit to a London bird
shop--we can get taken in at home.
My Quails have only done badly this season. They made
their first nest out in the open, during that miserable wet
stormy weather we had in July ; the second night after hatching
proved a regular deluge, and, with the exception of one chick,
all were drowned. After rearing the odd chick, the hen nested
again, inside this time; seven eggs were laid, all fertile, though
the young were unable to break out of the shell: want of
moisture, in this instance, proving as destructive as too much in
the first nest.

Sir,-- I saw recently a Grey Parrot which was brought to England
by Sir Malcolm Pasley in i860 or 1861. The bird was then a good talker,
but now it seldom speaks, and shows all the signs of extreme old age. A
cousin of mine saw this Autumn, in Venice, a Macaw, which is said to be
136 years old. One of the ladies who saw the bird, writes : " The old
servant of Don Carlos, living at Palazzo Balbi, said the bird had belonged
to the grandfather of the Duke." Don Carlos is called Duke of Madrid,
and his grandfather was Charles IV. of Spain. Charles IV. died in the first
decade of this century, " If Don Carlos," the lady adds, " had his parrot's
manners and appearance he might be King of Spain."

for hours on liis feet, disinclined to move and looking unhappy. He does
not take flights nor go to his bath as formerly, though he can fly well and
strongly. Can anything be done to improve this ? I should also be glad to
know how to treat a Green Avadavat ; its head and neck have been bare for
the last six weeks, at least, with no appearance of young feathers, and now I
see that the upper part of its back is in the same condition. All the other
birds (fifteen) are in good feather. I shall be very much obliged for advice

The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Ward :
Your Bullfinch is probably^ suffering from a slight touch of cramp :
in such cases a mild purgative, followed by strengthening medicine, is often
useful.
Give it, for one day, five grains of Epsom Salts in its drinking-
water ; and when this has acted effectively, give (instead) six drops daily of
syrup of phosphates in its drink.
Green Avadavats are especially addicted to plucking one another ;
so that, if you have more than one example, it is almost impossible to
prevent unsightliness: these little Waxbills are also somewhat combative,

Sir, -- I should be much obliged if you would let me know if it is
advisable to give Waxbills and African-finches green food and grass seeds ;
if so, what kinds ? I am only just starting to keep a few, and feed them on
millet, canary and spray millet. M. E. Stanyforth.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Stanyforth :
When grass is in seed, it is decidedly beneficial to collect a few hand-
fuls in the fields and give them to Waxbills and any other finches. Also
when chickweed is to be obtained fresh and not frostbitten it is a useful
green food. During the winter a little dry grass-seed, such as the corn-
chandlers supply, makes a welcome change of diet, but it is not absolutely
necessary to the health of the birds. A. G. BuTEER.

Sir, --I thought it might interest your readers to know I have bred
two hybrids (male and female) from a cock Sharp-tailed Finch and a hen
Silverbill.
They were born in July, and are most like the hen but a shade
darker, and have a few spangles here and there ; the bill and legs are also
darker. But what I think curious is that they have some dark red feathers
on the saddle, which are noticeable when flying. Neither parent has any
thing approaching a red tinge.
Their call-note is like the Sharptail, but the male hybrid sings like
a Silverbill only louder. They are lively and altogether very interesting
birds. Chas. Dell.

Sir, --The following case has just come under my notice, and is, I
think, worthy of being recorded in our Magazine.
An old lady has a tame Dove, a friendly and constant companion.
She is in the habit of taking a nap in her arm chair of an afternoon ; and
the Dove sits on the back of a chair close by : as the old lady dozes off, so
does the Dove. But the other day the Dove, instead of taking its seat on
its accustomed chair, perched on the lady's head, and, as the lady snoozed
off, comfortably nestled itself in her cap.
In due course the lady awoke, and tried to remove the Dove; but the
Dove declined to allow itself to be removed. A female relative came te
her assistance ; and then it was found that the Dove had laid an egg--a
beautiful instance of trust and confidence in a dumb creature.

fLagonosticta ccerulescens J .
By Rosie Alderson.
I purchased my pair of Lavender Finches in the spring of
1900, from Mr. Robert Green, Bedford Conservatories, Covent
Garden Market; and here I may mention in passing, that
though the prices are higher than most other dealers' his
birds are always very good. The Lavenders, when they
arrived, were in excellent condition, and in perfect plumage.
I put them in my smaller heated aviary, with many other
small Waxbills and Finches. The first nest was built in
half a cigar box, (placed lengthways on, and divided in the
centre). F&apos;ive eggs were laid towards the end of July. I left
home on August 7th, and learnt on my return that, when I had
been from home about ten days, three dead young birds had been
carried by the parents out of the nest. They were quite hard
and stiff, and evidently only a few days old. A little later a
fourth nestling was treated in the same manner, but it appeared
to have been dead only a short time, and was rather older than
the others. The fifth egg in the nest was clear. It was very
small, pure white, and round in shape.
Almost directly after this, indeed I believe it was the next
day, the birds began a second nest, in some Scotch fir branches,
fastened to the back wall in a far corner of the aviary. This
nest was not built in any box. It was chiefly composed of
hay, and fir needles, and was domed and oval in shape. I
returned home on September 13th, and the first news that
greeted me next morning was the information that it was believed
the Lavenders had hatched their eggs. But again my hopes
sank, for the parents scarcely seemed to go into the nest after
the first few days. I tried them with wasp grubs, ants' eggs, and
cut up mealworms; the latter item the Lavenders have always

been fond of. The wasp grubs they played with, but did not
seem to eat. Gentles they were almost indifferent to. I tried to
get some aphides, but it was too late in the year to be able to
keep up a supply.
On October ist, while I was in the aviary, one of the old
birds suddenly emerged from the nest with a young one dangling
from its beak. The poor little thing was quite dead, and looked
older than those in the first nest who had shared the same fate.
Its wing quills were very decided, and its body was covered with
grey down, but it was thin and did not seem to be well nourished.
It was very disappointing, and I was quite perplexed as to what
to provide in the way of extra diet to ensure the young being fed ;
but apparently there were no more in the nest, for the old birds
seemed to quite lose their interest in it, and one day I saw one of
them with a huge feather in its beak, as if preparing to build
again. So certain was I that the nest was forsaken, that I
arranged with a carpenter to come and make some alterations in
the aviary. As it would have meant endless trouble to have
caught up all the birds, he had to work amongst them. Un-
fortunately the work was in that part of the aviary that was near
to the Lavenders' nest. I noticed when the man went outside
that they flew round about, but I never suspected that any
young ones were left alive, and put it down to the naturally
inquisitive nature of the little birds. While the work was going
on, I was suddenly startled, while standing in the aviary, to see
what appeared to be one of my Uavenders suddenly grown
much smaller, shuffling rapidly across the floor, (it could hardly
be dignified by the name of flying). The small object fled
behind a hot water pipe, and tried to squeeze through a tiny
space, where the pipe passes through into the next aviary. It
nearly put an end to itself by getting its head fast, and I had a
terribly anxious moment trying to release it. The little thing
chirped loudly, and, when I at last got it free, it dashed off into
a far corner with great speed and disappeared from view. I
found it a few minutes later sitting in a corner looking quite
composed, and as if nothing had happened. Whether the
joiner's hammering had brought it out of the nest prematurely,
I do not know, but I should hardly think so, as, calculating that
the bird was hatched when I returned home, it must have been
about a month old. The baby Uavender was the sweetest little
ball of grey feathers, much the colour of the old birds, but
rather darker. The tail was dark red, edged with black, and
the wax skin round the beak very distinct. Its eyes were very
bright, and black as sloes. There were no white spots on the flanks

as in the adult bird, indeed, beneath the tail it was quite bare of
feathers.
It was most amusing to see the joy and pride of the
parents; they stood in front of the little creature, jerking their
tails with pleasure, and evidently exchanging congratulations
with each other on such a remarkable infant prodigy. The
young one received their adulation very calmly ; it slept that
night upon the floor, but by the next day had climbed up into
the branches. It was evidently partly fed on seed, as some
white millet was plainly visible in its crop. The old birds fed
it from the crop in exactly the same way as Canaries feed their
young, first working up the food in the throat, before transferring
it to the young bird.
The next day, finding a Bronze Mannikin inclined to peck
the young Lavender, I caught it, and also the hen, and put them
into a large cage, meaning to also secure the cock ; this I failed
to do, and the old birds so fretted at being parted, that I had to
let the captives out again. While I had them in the cage, I
examined the nest to see if there were any more young birds in
it, as if there had been I had meant to cut out the nest from the
branches, and fix it in the cage, (this was of course before I
abandoned the idea of being able to catch the cock). I found a
young bird, its crop quite empty, dead in the nest. It was very
plump, and nearly the size of the other bird, though the
plumage on its head was not so developed, and the bill and feet
were pinker than in the elder nestling. I think the poor little
thing must have died of starvation the day the joiner was in the
aviary. Later on, a third young bird, about the same size, was
found in the branches ; it had evidently been dead for some time,
for its body was quite dry and hard.
On October 13th, the little Lavender had mounted quite
high up in the branches. It could fly the length of the aviary,
and sat pluming its tiny wings with great satisfaction, and
amusing itself with nibbling the ends of the gorse twigs.
O11 October 24th, the old birds began to build a third nest,
near to where the first had been. I had purposely given them
no fresh material, (for it seemed unwise to let them nest again
though both birds seemed perfectly well and strong) but they
began stealing it from the other birds' nests, so I was obliged to
give way, and provide some. After I had done so, the work
progressed rapidly; by the evening of the next day, the nest,
(which was the same shape as the second one), was thickly roofed
over, the favourite material being asparagus bass, cut about three

inches long. I found if the sprays were given any longer they
became rather awkward for the birds to manage. Only one
bird seemed to work at once, and I fancy the hen did the
principal share. It was very pretty to watch them fetch a spray
and carry it up into the nest, then turn round and drag it inside.
They worked very fast, and raised the roof by pushing it up
vigorously from the inside with their beaks. A few feathers
formed the lining, and a narrow hollow tunnel, (hanging rather
downwards), was attached to the nest.
On Sunday, October 28th, I noticed the hen looked
puffy, but soon looked quite herself again, and I concluded the
first egg had been laid.
I wish I could leave the story of my little Lavenders
here, for the sequel is a very sad one. On November 3rd, the
hen was found ill, evidently egg bound, and scarcely able to fly
(though only a short time before she had looked quite bright and
lively). She died about ten o'clock at night to my great sorrow.
The cock and little one miss the hen very much, and look quite
lost without her, for the three made such a pretty trio. They still
sleep in the nest at night. I found there were no more eggs, so
apparently the hen did not commence to lay until almost a week
after the completion of the nest. I should add, in conclusion,
that, besides the usual seeds always in the aviary, namely
canary, white and Indian millet, and four kinds of grass seeds,
the birds have had for the last few weeks a dry mixture of
crushed broken biscuit, preserved } r olk of egg, and a little maw
seed. Of course this is given fresh daily. I first began it for
some breeding Canaries ; but the birds, and especially some small
Doves, all seem so fond of it, and it appears to do them so much
good, that I have continued it every day. Of course, as soon as
I knew about the young Lavender, I provided mealworms (cut
in several pieces) at short intervals during the da} r , and, what I
think very important, always left some mealworms over-night, so
as to be ready for the birds first thing in the morning. To-day,
November 12th, I have examined the Lavenders' second nest
(the autumn cleaning in the aviary having begun) and I find it is
made of chickweed, hay and feathers, the latter woven in as well
as lining it. Inside I found one or two ants' eggs, which looks as
if they had formed part of the food for the young ones. The
interior of the nest was very dirty.
Lavender Finches have always been great favourites of
mine ; their little ways are so quaint and cheerful. One very fine
cock I once had, called " Little Billee," was the liveliest of all

my tiny birds, and the ringleader in any mischief that was on
the stir. It was in the days before I had my aviary, and all my
little Waxbills lived in a large three compartment cage.
" Billee " was very fond of bathing in the glass bath that
hung on the cage door, but was too great a coward to go in head
first, and always lowered himself gently backwards into the
water, in a most amusing fashion. I have not found Lavender
Finches at all delicate if once acclimatised. "Billee" lived for
a long time, and much enjoyed his freedom in the aviary, but,
with his wife, came to a sad end. She was a very healthy bird,
and the darkest in colour I have ever seen. An ailing, newly
arrived Zebra Waxbill escaped through a bent wire out of its
quarantine cage, and, though at first there appeared nothing
much the matter with it, infected not only my hen Zebra, but
also both the Lavenders. As usual they were very curious over
the new comer, and paid a terrible penalty for their inquisitive-
ness. Only one out of the four birds (the hen Zebra) recovered ;
one after another the others died.
Two other Lavenders I once had infected each other,
almost directly after their arrival, with a most curious disease,
iu the form of wax coloured growths on the face, spreading
very rapidly over the eyes. Both were chloroformed, as it
seemed cruel to let them continue to live. I am thankful to say
I have never had a bird suffer from the same thing before or
since
The baby Lavender, who must by now be about two
months old, shows no sign of the white dots on the flanks, and
its tail is still much darker than the adult cock bird ( a).

By A. Coraue Charrington.
I am tempted to send a short account of my aviaries,
which, although they do not contain anything very original,
afford me much pleasure. I think the experiences of other
amateurs form one of the most interesting parts of the Magazine.
I have three outdoor aviaries facing S.E., but sheltered by
the house from the east. They lead one out of the other, and
consist of a boarded shed, and wire runs, each run being about io
feet wide, and 15 feet long. The shed is quite open to the run, but
("). Will not Miss Alderson be so kind as to say in what particulars, if any, the
plumage of her breeding female differed from that of its mate ?--K. P.
Since the above was written the white spots have fully appeared on the flanks. I
first noticed them on Dec. 4th.--R. A.

lias a high roof for shelter. Part of the run is covered over with
rain proof felt, which helps to keep the run dry. The end aviary
is rather exposed to the S.W. gales, so there are two removable
shelters made to rise on the outside of the run ; these are covered
with Duroline, a material consisting of woven wire, washed over
with a transparent yellow substance like varnish. This is quite
rain and wind proof, but lets in light and warmth. During the
summer (from May to November), I have kept in No i. aviary
a pair of Chinese Quails, two pairs of Gouldian Finches and a pair
of Zebra Finches.
In No. 2. I have had Zebra Finches, a pair of Trumpeter
Bullfinches, a North American Siskin, a cock Nonpareil, one
hen Chinese Quail, and a pair (or perhaps I should say two)
Bleeding-heart Pigeons.
In No. 3, a pair of Californian Partridges, two Rosy Pastors,
a Green Singing Finch, a pair of Parson Finches, and a pair of
White-headed Dove-birds
One pair of Chinese Quails had twenty-two eggs, but did
not sit steadily; and there was no result from these eggs, though
some were fertile. She then laid nine more eggs, and sat
steadily, hatching seven. Unfortunately I had to go to Scotland
the day they were hatched, and when I returned a month later
only one survived. I am told it is impossible to rear them with-
out fresh ants' eggs. Is this so ? The survivor lived for a week,
and was very healthy and lively on a diet of Abrahams' mixture,
Spratt's game meal, and small mealworms, but I found it dead
one morning. The hen Quail laid five more eggs, but it was
then too late in the year and I took them away.
My Gouldians nested freely, but only one hen laid. She
had five eggs, on which she and the cock both sat most faithfully,
but they did not hatch, tho' all were fertile. They are now
indoors in a large cage, nesting again, but I must remove one
pair, as they disturb each other. I find these birds easy to keep
on canary seed, spray millet, and a little maw seed, with, in
summer, unlimited chickweed, grass tufts, and particularly
shepherd's purse--and always cuttle-boue and egg shell. The
two pairs eat most of an egg shell in twenty-four hours.
The second pair of Gouldians have not nested, or rather
have not laid as yet. I see in the November No. of the " Avicultural"
Mr. Wiener recommends the seed of a grass, Setaria glauca , as
very much appreciated by Gouldians. I wrote to Messrs. Sutton
for some, but they do not keep it. I should be glad to know
where I can get it.

I have had eight Zebra Finches from two pairs, all cocks.
They are very beautiful little birds I think, tho' so common.
My Parson Finches have built one nest after another, all
the summer, in every box, husk, and bush they can see, but have
not laid. Last year they laid on the ground, but did not build.
They are now building again in a box tree--but I fear it is too
late for any results outdoors.
No. 2 aviary is too crowded, I had no breeding results.
The Desert Bullfinches laid five eggs in April, but did not
hatch, and the hen died in June, when I found she was a ball of
fat. I am not sure if my Bleeding-heart Pigeons are a pair.
They agree fairly well, and one sometimes follows the other
about cooing in a deep tone, and bowing till his beak touches
the ground. 1 notice these birds drink without raising the head,
as do also the Gouldians. They keep the beak down in the
water for some seconds, and seem to suck up the water.
In No. 3 aviary, the Californian Partridges laid over
thirty eggs, but are so wild that they did not attempt to sit. I
put some under a Bantam, but, tho' they all contained chicks,
they did not hatch. Next spring I shall put them in a wire-
covered fruit run, and see if they will be happier. They will
have more shelter and insedt food. Apropos of fruit runs, I had a
Silver hen Pheasant in this run all last summer, and she cleaned
the gooseberry bushes of every caterpillar, and did no harm to
any of the fruit, while she herself had the look of absolute
health.
In August last I purchased a pair of White-headed Love-
birds, and as the weather was fine turned them out at once. I
was away a month, and on my return could not find the hen any-
where. After several days watching of every box and corner, I
caught her burrowing under the tub containing a box tree in the
centre of the run ; and once having run her to earth I constantly
saw her carrying small pieces of leaf she had cut out of a large
branch of Eucalpytus, under the tub. She tucked the pieces
under her back and wing feathers, and her feathers became quite
rough by this process. The cock kept watch most vigorously,
and drove away any bird who was daring enough to go anywhere
near. He fed her at the entrance to the hole. After three weeks
of patience I ventured to lift the tub and investigate, only to
find bits of egg shell and one clear egg. The nest was on the
ground, just a slight hollow filled with cuttings of leaf. The
hen went to work again, and laid three eggs, which I left a week,
and then finding them clear, I took them. Is it not unusual for

these birds to nest on the ground ? I propose leaving them out
all the winter. Will it be safe ?
The Rosy Pastors are two cocks, and most charming birds ;
very tame and most quaint in the way they run about and
chatter at each other. They remain out all the winter.
I want very much to breed some Mocking Birds. I had
one for over nine 3^ears, and his brother for nearly seven years.
They were brought me from Virginia out of the nest. They
were wonderful singers, going on in summer all night and
day, and ultimately died of old age.
I was in Madeira last spring, and had the great pleasure of
visiting Mrs. Reid's aviaries. Her articles in our Magazine are
so interesting, that it was nice to see her birds.
Her Grey Parrots breeding in a small cask in the open
were the picture of health, and her endless other Parrots,
Finches and Waxbills were nesting and living as happily as if in
their wild state. Of course the climate is a great help to
success, and I came away with a feeling of despair at having to
cope with our dull, damp climate. The Cordon Bleus in
Madeira were a never failing source of envy to me. One saw
cages of twenty or thirty of them at a time, in the perfection of
plumage and brisk health ; but they cost a great deal, 8/- a pair,
which seemed too much. I wonder if any of our members can
help to name a bird which I saw for sale in Madeira. It was the
size of a Java Sparrow, with much the same shaped beak, but
thicker, and dull slate colour. The plumage of the bird
was glossy jet black (like a Combasou), but on the point
of each shoulder was a round spot of white, the size of a sixpence.
It had a very melodious whistle, loud for its size, and lived on
canary and millet. The man who had it said it came from
Demarara, and he had seen only one other. This bird was very
old, or I would have bought him. I fear I have digressed far
from my original subject, but one thinks of so many points of
interest when writing of birds, that I hope I may be excused.
One other little point may interest your readers. I brought home a
Madeira Canary, which lives in a cage in the same room as an
Indian Plum-headed Parrakeet. The Canary's song is an absolute
imitation of the Parrakeet's whistles and cries, in miniature, and
I have distinctly heard it whistle " prettjr dear," and once " pretty
Polly," mixed up with its song. It sounds most extraordinary,
especially when the two birds go on together.

By the Lady Dunleath.
Perhaps some of your readers may be interested in hearing
of my aviary. It consists of a one-roomed. cottage, 12 ft. high,
18 ft. wide, 30 ft. long: it is thatched first with straw and after
that with heather ; the inside, walls and roof, is covered with
dove-tailed wood sheeting, and the floor is covered with peat
moss litter. It has besides the door, six windows, two at each
side and two larger ones in front, all of which open, and the
openings are protected by half-inch mesh wire. The outside
run is 90ft. by 51ft., and in it I have planted small evergreen trees,
and stumps of trees and dead branches are put here and there
round the sides; in the middle there is a shallow cement bath.
Both the cottage and the run are divided down the centre by
half-inch mesh wire. In one side I have thirteen Parrakeets,
one pair of Teal, two Popes, seven Californian Quails, and one
pair beautiful Nicobar Pigeons, and Nanday, Rose-headed, Scaly-
breasted, Purple*headed, and Brown-cheeked Parrakeets. In the
other side I have St. Helena Waxbills, Golden-breasts, Paradise
Whydalis with splendid tails, Orange and Red Bishops, one
Crested Cardinal, one pair Virginian Nightingales, a Pekin
Robin, two pairs Indigo-birds, two Nonpareils, Zebra Doves, Cut-
throats, Zebra Finches, Combasous, Saffron Finches, Canaries,
one pair Black-headed Gouldian Finches, and two pairs Parson
Finches. I started the aviary last March and put out Canaries,
all of which have done well. Towards the end of May I put out
Waxbills and other birds, Weavers, Nuns, and so on, and had
very few deaths. In June, I was obliged to go abroad, and during
my absence the Popes reared one young one, with a tawny
orange head. It was strong and able to fly, when unfortunately
it was killed by a very heavy storm of rain. Returning through
Paris I bought there about twenty Waxbills, some Nonpareils
and Whydalis. They were far less expensive than in England
and have all done very well. I kept them in their travelling
cages in London for a fortnight, and took great care of them,
feeding and watering them several times a day, and keeping
them out on a small flat roof outside my lodging window. As
soon as I returned home I put them in the aviary and did not
lose one. The Popes built again in July, making their nest in
some furze branches under the roof. They laid two eggs, one of
which was hatched ; and the young bird feathered very quickly.

It was apparently quite strong and healthy and able to fly
through the aviary, when one day I found it twirling round and
round on the floor. I did all I could for it but it died. It was very
fat, and in beautiful plumage. The parents were very fond of it,
and whenever I gave them mealworms, took them at once to the
young one. I also reared a Zebra Dove, but rain killed it after
it was able to fly about outside. There have been about twenty
young Zebra Finches all doing well, and I saw a nest of six:
appear only the other day just able to fly. The Parson Finches
also sat on eggs, but the mice, who I am sorry to say have found
out the aviary, broke them all (one mouse was found in the nest).
There is all round the aviary a bed of cement, which prevents
any rat from finding a way in, and I thought the wire mesh was
small enough to keep out mice ; but we have killed nine in the
cottage. I now propose to hang branches and nesting boxes
from the roof by thin wire, as the sides of the house are so
smooth that no mouse could get up them. If it had not been
for the mice I should have reared very many more birds.
I got the Gouldians from P. Castang, Leadenhall Market ;
they are very handsome, and in perfect health. To-night ( b ) for
the first time I have shut the door and front windows, the tem-
perature being forty-five inside. The aviary is not heated. My
Virginian Cardinals made several nests and laid eggs, but
unluckily the Popes were in the same division and killed the
cock Cardinal.
I have had for some years a big heated aviary in a large
conservatory attached to the house, and I intend, if I find any of
the birds suffer from the cold, to move them up to it. I have
as yet only had to bring in two Parrakeets, which were in full
moult and felt the cold very much. The others are all in
beautiful plumage, having all moulted outside. The Nonpareils
last week had hardly a feather, and were covered with "spikes,"
yet they persisted in roosting out of doors, and are now almost
in their full plumage and the Indigo and Combasous have got
their Winter suits.
I forgot to say that I reared ten Californian Quails
from a cock and two hens ; I tried to bring them up under
Bantams, but only succeeded with seven as the Bantams broke
so many eggs : the parents brought up six, but three died. I
have only three cocks, the rest being hens. The two hens laid
about 60 eggs.

ACCIDENTS.
By Reginald Phillipps.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964838" page_id="10098610"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
Some years ago a well-known authority, giving a lecture,
made a statement to the effect that if a bird meets with an
accident it is best to kill it and get another, as it is not worth
while to nurse an injured bird. After the ledture, I mildly
protested ; and the great man replied that it was a mere matter of
sentiment. To my mind it is much more than a mere matter of
sentiment. If we keep birds it is our duty to do our best for
them ; and I always feel that the familiar words of Cowper are
not inapplicable in this connection :--
" He was designed tliy servant, not thy drudge,
And know--that his Creator is thy judge."
Miss Alderson, as shewn by her interesting letter which
appears at page 207, Vol. vi., has followed in the footsteps of the
humane poet; and I hope that the Shama whose life she has
spared may live to reward her with many a long hour of brilliant
song.
Nevertheless I am not satisfied that it was necessary to
amputate the leg. Let me state a case.
A Chinese Blue-Pie (Urocissa erythrorkyncha), a great pet
of ours, who was most nervous and fidgety in her younger days,
during 1888-9 broke the upper part of one of her legs no fewer
than three times:--(1) an Ariel Toucan approached the outside
of the aviary in which she was confined ; and in her hurry to
dash at him and shew off her magnificence and her pluck (she was
an arrant coward--but then there was wire-netting between them)
she caught a claw in the wire, and snap went the limb. (2) When
convalescent, one night she was frightened by the approach of a
stranger, dashed about in her cage, and re-broke the leg. (3 ) A
3'ear or so later, while as it is supposed she was hiding some tit-
bit amongst some books which had been piled up in an untidy
heap, several fell on her, breaking her leg again ; this time a
very serious compound fracture. On each of these occasions
the limb was set and its use regained. And when I add that she
lived with us, without further mishap of the same kind, for
some nine years after the last fracture, in the enjoyment of
excellent health and the use of both legs, living with us
altogether for over twelve years before we passed her on to a
friend, I think it will be seen that it is not necessary to kill a
bird just because it has broken its leg, nor as a rule to amputate
the limb.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995162069767442" page_id="10098611"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
On one occasion I was taking a farewell look at the birds
before starting for the West of England, and tossed down a
mealworm in a narrow path for a Cuckoo, a wall being on one
side and thick bushes on the other. A Stork, seeing the meal-
worms in my hand, charged down the path at me just as the
Cuckoo was making for his mealworm. The sudden appearance
of the Stork flurried the Cuckoo, who lost his head and got
trodden upon, his leg being broken just at the joint. ,1 at once
applied a figure-of-8 bandage, very hurriedly for trains will not
wait even for a broken-legged Cuckoo, and placed the bird in
the same cage which had three times sheltered the old Blue-Pie.
On my return about a month later, I found that, owing to the
bandage having become relaxed or worked a trifle loose, the
limb was slightly crooked, but otherwise quite well, and the
joint not showing much sign of stiffness. The bird too was in
excellent health ; and even the plumage was more presentable
than is too often the case with the Cuckoo in confinement.
In later years a Himalayan Blue-Pie (Urocissa occipitalis ),
on arriving here, when loosed out of his travelling box was
found to have broken the upper part of his leg. This likewise
was set, and the full use of the limb recovered.
With a broken leg, I am of opinion that unquestionably
the limb should be set. To leave it unset, as some have
recommended, is cruel; and, if it be the upper part that is
broken, fatal results may be expected to follow.
It might seem unnecessary to add that, in setting a bird's
leg, it must be set with the leg bent up, to enable the bird to
stand on the other leg. I was out on the last occasion that our
old Blue-Pie broke her leg ; and when I reached home I found
that a Vet. had been called in, who had fixed the limb perfectly
stiff and straight, and so stretched and pulled down from the
body as to reach fully an inch below the other leg. I remarked
that the bird could not possibly live with the leg in that position,
as it could neither eat, nor drink, nor stand, and would batter
itself to pieces the instant it was loosed,--to which the Vet,
made reply that that was how he always set a horse's leg. But
a bird is not a horse * and although the poor beast was nearly dead
from exhaustion, for she had been under very rough treatment
for nearly two hours, and although night had come, there was no
help for it but to cut off the bandages as best we might, and
make a fresh start. Now it had so come about that, after the
second break, the leg had been set with the toes pointing out too
much, an unsightliness with which we had patiently borne for

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.991612953488372" page_id="10098612"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
many months, and which I was now determined not to repeat;
and with this resolve biasing my eye, and with the assistance of
the shadows cast by artificial light, and aided still further by my
anxiety to dispose of the case as speedily as possible, I fixed the
leg this time with the toes turned in too much--and in this
slightly awkward but not unsightly position it remained to the
end. As a consequence the bird, when at rest, would often place
one foot on the top of the other, as if folding her hands as it were ;
and this used to give her a singularly quaint and pathetic aspect.
But I doubt if anyone ever noticed that there was anything wrong,
or suspected for a moment that a leg had ever been broken.
When a bird is being operated upon for any length of
time, a taste of water (not too cold) given now and again, and
even a taste of plain, unsweetened, watery sop, will greatly
refresh and give it heart; and a little fluid magnesia should be
added to allay the fever. Brandy should not be given unless
there should be faintness or collapse, and then only sparingly,
and should not on any account be continued; and the food
during the illness should be of the plainest.
A broken wing is often a less serious matter, for the bird
can hop about and keep in health ; and sometimes the muscles
will keep the wing in position and render a bandage unnecessary.
The patient, however, should be kept in a very low box cage,
with a perch but a trifle off the ground, so that it may not be put
to any temptation to open its wings; but this is only speaking
generall} r , for the details of the treatment of every case must
depend upon the nature of the case.
Iu March, 1898, my bird-woman came to me with the
intelligence that one of the birds had just fallen on to the floor. On
the floor of thebirdroom I found a little shapeless ball of feathers.
A Redrump had nipped a male Grey Siugingfinch, breaking the
wing; and the shock and the fall seemed to have killed the bird. But
it recovered ; and since lias been, and is still, the best songster
of the flock, and has been the father of several fully-reared
youngsters. Iu this case I made a mistake, and let him out of
the hospital too soon, and direct from the box cage to the aviary
and the company of a quarrelsome Green Siugingfinch. As a
consequence, the limb "gave" a little; and although the bird
can fly perfectly well, when at rest it may be seen that the wing
is a trifle out of position, which was apparently not the case
when the bird was first restored to liberty.
Iu September, 1899, I found that one of my two Red-
backed Buntings (.Embcrizci rutila ) had a broken wing. I think

a nervous Piecl Gralliua (Grallina picata ), a new arrival, had
given it a casual peck. Taking warning by the Grey Singing-
finch, I kept the Bunting in the hospital for a longer time, and
placed it for a while in a flight cage before returning it to the
aviary. At the present time it is absolutely impossible to detect
the slightest trace of injury to the wing, or to say which bird (of
course I personally know the bird) was injured or which wing
was broken. It still is, as it previously had been, much the
better and the more active bird of the two. The mend seems
to be perfect.
I mention these details with the view of helping our
younger friends, and encouraging them to do their best for their
feathered captives, and not unnecessarily to take away their poor
little lives just in order to save trouble,--not but that I must
fully admit that a broken limb, especially a leg, is often a very
wearisome business to attend to.

AVIARY FOR WEAVERS.

Sir, --It is a great pleasure to hear that a member of the Avicultural
Society has as much as 60 by 24 feet space at his disposal, and proposes to
devote this to an aviary for Weavers.
Great tilings can be done with such an aviary. But if adequately
stocked with hundreds of birds, many battles and much bloodshed and
murder would result in the breeding season. To avoid this and to obtain
success in breeding, divisions are necessary. If an aviary of 60 feet long is
divided into three, four, or five compartments of 20, 15, or 12 feet in length
each, very much more breeding will be accomplished than if the same
number of birds are free to quarrel in one huge space.
Another point to consider is that, in an aviary 24 feet deep the birds
would become shy and wild. They would, on the approach of an observer,
retire to the farther perches, trees, or shrubs, and at something like 20 feet
distance it becomes difficult to watch a bird's life and habits ; whilst foreign
birds soon become used to being looked at more closely when housed in
compartments of less depth, allowing of better observation.
If I had such a space for an aviary, I should carry a corridor through
the middle of it, and cut up the 24 feet depth into compartments of 8 feet
in depth, allow 5 or 6 feet for a corridor, and the remaining 10 or 11 feet as
maximum depth.
As regards height, I do not quite share the opinion of my very
esteemed friend, Dr. A. G. Butler, that about 10 feet should be the maximum.
In writing " I should not recommend that the aviary be more than 10 feet
high : it is difficult to catch birds in very lofty aviaries."--Dr. Butler
probably thought of the necessity of catching with a net weakly, or
damaged, or quarrelsome individuals. With a net it is of course difficult to
catch any bird in an aviary higher than 10 feet. But is it necessary to use
a net at all ?

I found that entering an aviary with a net frightens and upsets the
birds in a dangerous manner. Broods would become infallibly disturbed.
We easily lose sight, in the general turmoil, of the one individual whose
removal has become necessary, even at the risk of accidents, which are
more than likely.
When I wanted to catch a bird I never used a net, but entered my
aviary very quietly, armed with a pot of tepid water and my gardener's small
liot-house syringe. My birds knew me, and did not mind much my coming
among them. I waited quietly until the bird whose capture was desired was
in a favourable position, and easily marked him with a well-directed stream
of water from my syringe. A second douche was easily applied and brought
him down, when he was caught by hand, put in a cage in readiness, and in
a quarter-of-an-hour the bird would be dry and feeding again as if nothing
had happened. In this way I avoided all accidents and any very great
excitement. I see no reason why an aviary should not be more than io feet
high, and would not mind having one 15 feet high and even more.
To have flowering plants in an aviary is impossible. To have climb-
ing plants like honeysuckle, ivy, or Virginia creeper (c) outside the wire
and overgrowing the aviary would be pretty, but end in disaster. These
plants would only help mice, rats, stoats, cats, and other enemies of the
birds to climb all over the aviary.
The only plants which I found possible to keep alive inside my
aviary were: ivy in pots, arbor vitae, and holly. All these can be obtained
of large size at reasonable prices, but they should be well established
before the birds are put into the aviary. I should be half inclined to try a
weeping willow, if there is time to plant a big tree and to allow the roots
to become well established, for it will always be a race between the tree and
the birds, whether the birds will destroy the buds and shoots faster than
nature develops them. But even a dead weeping willow would be useful
to Weavers.
A pair of Grenadier Weavers once built a most beautiful nest in mv
aviary in the top of a straggling holly tree, and brought up a brood of five
young. I could never understand how this interesting family and their
mother found room in their nest.
The floor is best made of cement, as a protection against rats and
mice (to be afterwards covered with gravelly sand) as suggested by Dr.
Butler. But perhaps a third of the floor might be laid out with garden
mould. I would try this, and sow it with a rough kind of fast growing
grass. This grass would of course soon be pulled up by the Weavers, but,
by keeping half or one third covered in rotation with a small forcing frame,
successive crops might be obtained with advantage.
It is not advisable to keep any Finches with Weaver-birds; but
Thrushes, the beautiful African Glossy Starlings, or small Indian Pagoda
Starlings, Mocking-birds, Mynahs, and such birds have been kept by me
with Weavers in the open-air parts of my aviary, without accidents. The
very pretty small Chinese Quails, or the graceful Californian Quails, might
also live in the company of Weaver-birds. Aug. F. Wiener.
(c). I have any amount of Virginia creeper in and on and all about my aviary ; the
birds delight in it, but the cats do not. The birds delight also in the balsam and common,
but not in the Lombardy, poplars ; and these not only live but flourish.--R. P.

(i) A. G. B.'s, and (2) D. S.-S.'s comments on same.
1. I have seen Dr. Butlers aviaries. He has had years of experience

of them, and during that time he states he has kept them without artificial
light; therefore that practically ends the matter there. But his aviaries
(excepting two) are largely constructed of glass, and are almost as light as
outdoor aviaries; when writing, I had in mind the ordinary bird-room, and
therefore my use of "sine qua non," re indoor aviaries, was certainly too
sweeping. At the same time, it appears to be the general experience of
aviculturists that, in the bird-room, artificial light is beneficial, and tends to
lessen mortality during the dark days of Winter, especially in London, (d)
2. Mr. D. Seth-Smitli&apos;s note is set against my last paragraph, that
was written in the light of my whole article, in which I insist on shelter
from the N. and E. as a sine qua. non.
In London we are very heavily handicapped against the country ; fogs,
impure air, etc. (even iu the suburbs) make the keeping of birds in or out
doors none too easy a matter. I should have more confidence in my ideal
aviary, pitched in an open field, in open country, than iu London ; of
course, under such circumstances, the enclosure should be boarded up on
the N. and E., and have open wire work or netting on the S., W. and roof,
the small shelters or one large one having openings on the S. only.
Will the Rev. C. D. Farrar kindly break his silence as regards his
aviaries, and give us a description ? As far as I can gather from what he
has written, they are very similar to my ideal; if I am wrong perhaps he
will correct me. It was really from reading his experiences, and from a list
he kindly gave me of the birds I could keep out of doors all the year round
(and his county, Yorkshire, is one of the coldest and bleakest of English
counties), that decided me to take up aviculture again, as, with the excep-
tion of a pet or two in a cage, I must keep them out of doors or not at all.
Finally, none of the birds mentioned in my article have been in my
possession less than four years, most of them for a longer period, so that
my facts were not hastily arrived at; and I venture to assert that, if the
conditions I have named are carried out, the birds named can be success-
fully kept out of doors all the year round in the open country.
Our Magazine gets more interestingly useful month by month, and
those responsible for same are certainly entitled to the heart}&apos; thanks of all
the members, for the time and labour unselfishly given, though the
success attained (and greater) is, I expect, all they require and aim at.
There must be, though, still many members who do not contribute their
avicultural experiences ; this is certainly to be regretted.
WESLEY T. Page.

Sir.--I shall be very grateful if any member will kindly identify a
pair of birds I have just purchased. The dealer from whom I bought them
calls them Yellow-breasted Finches, and says that they came from Asia,
and fed on canary seed and mealworms.
The birds are about the size of a Java Sparrow, but much more active-
looking. The back is brown-green, with narrow, regular, black marks
(about lialf-an-incli long) running down it. The wings and tail are also
brown-green, but each feather has a light, dull yellow edge, giving the
bird something the appearence of a Lizard Canary. The breast and
under parts are bright Canary yellow, while the head and throat are rich
chestnut brown, making a very beautiful contrast. The beak and legs are
both flesh-coloured, and the middle and hind toes are larger than the
others. The eyes are very round and black.
In the cock, the Canary yellow meets at the back of the neck, but
in the hen the top of the head is green-brown, and merges into the back
colouring. They are decidedly handsome birds, very quiet and intelligent.
I have found them very fond of mealworms, and they are birds that soon
seem to get tame. Can you kindly tell me, (rst) their correct name, (2nd)
their proper treatment, (3rd) about their value per pair.
Might I make a small suggestion while writing, namely, that in anv
article in the Magazine where the Latin name of a bird is used, the English
one should also he added. To any Member, who, like myself, is not a verv
good Latin scholar, it would make the interesting accounts of different
birds much simpler reading, than when a book of reference has to be
turned to, every few minutes, to translate a Latin name. R. Aederson.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Aldersou :
I have no doubt that your birds are what are called Japanese
Buntings; though whether they are obtainable wild in Japan, is doubtful.
Red-backed Bunting used to be the dealer's name for the kind.
Your description of the back is perhaps more applicable to the
common Indian species, Emheriza luteola, known as the Brown-headed
Bunting, but I do not think this bird has been much imported latelv,
whereas the Red-backed Bunting has been fairly common in the market.
I should feed on canary, oats, and sunflower, with two or three mealworms
daily. Prices vary according to the supply in the market, but I should not
dream of paying more than 10/- a pair for them myself; indeed I think (if
I remember rightly) I refused a pair at a lower price. A. G. Buti.er.

Sir --I have found Parson Finches, also the Long-tailed Grass Finches,
veritable demons in a small aviary--killing Mannikins, Nonpareils, and
Waxbills, by tearing open the skin between the shoulders--Is this their
usual disposition, or is it due, perhaps, to the aviary being too small for the
weaker or less aggressive birds to get out of the murderers' way ?

liave found the Parson Finch extremely aggressive. A cock I once had (e)
killed a ribbon Finch and pulled several feathers from the back of a Bar-
shouldered Dove. Another made itself very objectionable in a community
of Mannikins and Waxbills ; several of which, I believe, were killed by it.
I have never possessed a cock of the Dong-tailed Grass Finch, but should
expect it to show a similar disposition.

Sir,--I have been much interested in the remarks of Mr. Page and
Mr. Phillipps as to the heat birds require in Winter.
Mr. Page's remarks confirm Mr. Farrar's experience as to the cold
Avadavats will endure with impunity. They rather confirm what I have
noticed in Parrots--that cold can be endured as long as there are no
draughts.
And vet I find that there is a great difference in Parrots as to suscep-
tibility to cold; a difference I cannot explain. For instance, Amazons,
Macaws, Cockatoos, Conures, Ringnecks, and Broadtails seem indifferent to
cold ; and Grey Parrots, Dories, Pceocephali, and Caiques to be very suscep-
tible to it.
I think I have seen it stated that migrants bear cold in aviaries better
than seed-eating residents.
Mr. Buxton, in his experiments at Northrepps, found the dislike of
the Grey Parrot to cold was an advantage to them, as they took shelter,
which the Cockatoos not doing, got their toes frostbitten (f).
It would be very useful if aviculturists would give us their experience
on this point. F. G. Dutton.

Sir,--I quite agree with Mr. Wiener that artificial light is necessary
for small birds at night in the Winter.
In the beginning of November I found, one morning, in 1113^ outdoor
aviary, a small Green Avadavat lying dead ; it was plump and in perfect
plumage. Since then I have had a paraffin lamp lighted at 4.30, and hung
in a large wire enclosure in the centre of the aviary (in the cottage, of
course). The small birds, which used to look puffy and unhappy in the
mornings when I let them out of doors, now all are in perfect health. I go
down to the aviary frequently after dark and look through the window, and
always find numbers of birds feeding, both large and small. I have lost
none since. The lamp burns itself out during the night.
I shut up the birds at 3.30 p.m., and let them out about 10. a.m. In
the Winter all the food is inside the cottage; also water, which I find is
quite as important during the night as seed. N. J. F. Dunreath.
( e ) It died last spring after about five years' captivity.
(/ I have found this to be the case with many totally different species. Many
species which sleep in boxes will endure cold which will kill others equally robust, but
who habitually sleep in the open.--R. P.

GRASS SEED FOR GOULDIAN FINCHES.

Mrs. R. H. Gosling presents her compliments to Mr. Cresswell,
and will be glad to know, in reference to Mr. Wiener&apos;s letter on Gonldian
Finches' food, whether the grass seed Setaria glauca would answer in
winter, procured from a seedsman, and given with millet, or whether the
birds would only eat it in the ear, and could then only have it given to
them for a short time each year, when the grass seed was ripe.
The following reply has been sent to Airs. Gosling :
No definite reply can be given. The frequently considerable
mortality of Gonldian Finches, the occurence of egg binding, and the
production of eggs without shells, point to the insufficiency of the usual
food consisting of canary seed and spray millet. The fresh ears of Setaria
glauca were tried with great success only quite recently. Since then I
have given dried ears of the same grass, but found that the birds did not
pick the dried ears as eagerly as they did the fresh. On the other hand I
noticed that, when the bunch of dry ears was removed for the purpose of
cleaning the cage, the Gonldian Finches eagerly picked the fallen grains out
of the sand.
It should be well worth trying the effect of adding a little Setaria
glauca seed to the food of Gonldian Finches. The results of one experi-
ment with any food are scarcely conclusive evidence, because birds differ
individually to some extent. In estimating results it should also be borne
in mind that birds, in a state of nature, do not eat the same seeds all the
year round. It would not astonish me if it were found that the eagerness
of birds for some kinds of food varied somewhat with the seasons.
As observation in a cage can be much more close than in an aviary,
and Gonldian Finches are mostly kept in cages, it is to be hoped that
owners of these beautiful birds will publish the results of their observations.
Aug. F. Wiener.
F.S. Carbon copy and a few ears of Setaria glauca were sent to Airs.
Gosling.
Sir, --I have read with great interest Air. Wiener's account of
his Gouldian Finches, and of the good effect the grass-seed Setaria glauca
had upon them. I have seven cocks and five hens, which fly about the bird-
room. They only go to their cage to rest, and they generally nest in it also.
Three of these birds I have had for four years, the others I got only a year
ago. The hens have uever looked in as good feather as the cocks. They
have all moulted regularly in the spring, and up to a few weeks ago they
were in magnificent plumage. Two of them are now losing the feathers
round the beak and back of the head, and two of them have a sort of white
cheesy growth at the corners of the mouth. I have had to separate the hens
in a cage by themselves, for I found their mates were continually fighting
over them and maltreating them. They made a nest lately in a cocoa nut
husk and several eggs were laid, but they were all thrown out and broken,
and most of them were soft-shelled. Twice I saved a hen, who was egg-
bound. I should be very much obliged if you would tell me if Setaria glauca
is to be had in this country, and where ? I have always given my Gouldians
flowering grass every day, when it is to be had, and I find tliev are verv
fond of fresh chickweed, and every other day I give them a teaspoouful of

crushed hemp, which the}- finish in a few minutes. Do you think this is the
reason they are not looking well ? The four hens which are by themselves
are improving. They all seem to have had the first joint of the wing
injured, I should say by being bitten (a Gouldian can bite, as I know by
experience), then the feathers have dropped out. More than once I have
found the joint bleeding, and they cannot fly, and indeed can scarcely hop
up to the perch without great effort, otherwise they are in tight good
feather. Claude D. Rotch.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Rotch :
I am uot aware that Setaria glauca seed can be bought at such a price
as to be available for bird food. It may be obtainable from seedsmen in
small quantities.
Seven cocks and five lieu Gouldian Finches would require a large-
sized bird-room. If the proportion of sexes were reversed there would be
less cause for jealous} - and less fighting. All finches that I ever kept fought
more or less during the pairing season, especially when there were more
than one pair of the same species. Cock Gouldian Finches are certainly
very pugnacious. I have heard of them killing their mates, therefore it
would be better not to have more males than females. As a rule the
fighting is harmless, but individuals differ.
The loss of feathers round the beak and on the back of the head, as
well as the injury to the wings, is probably due to fighting. A white cheesy
growth at the corners of the mandibles has never been observed by me on
any finch, and I do not venture to guess at its cause.
In consequence of your letter I offered some hempseed to my
Gouldians, but they would not look at it. I am inclined to think that
hemp would be too heating for these birds and make them more quarrel-
some.
Whilst your Gouldian Finches are very fond of chickweed, mine will
not touch it. Chickweed late in the year, after having been exposed to
frost, or fog, or much cold rain, should not be given to birds, as it may cause
sickness. Although the fact of your birds being in "tight good feather&apos;'
seems to negative the supposition, the growth you mention might be due
to wet chickweed. In their native country these birds would scarcely get
green food which has been exposed to English Autumn rains and fogs.
I should diminish the number of male birds, and separate the damaged
females until quite recovered on a diet of canary seed and spray millet.
The real cause of and certain remedy for soft eggs and egg-binding
in the case of Gouldian Finches has, I fear, yet to be discovered ; but
if all members of the Avicultural Society will please to publish their
experience in the Magazine, the cause and remedy will scarcely remain
unknown very much longer (g). Aug. F. WiENRR.
(g). Give plenty of liberty, space, proper sand, and cuttle-bone, and separate the
sexes for about half the year (unless you have a specially good winter aviary), and they
will not lay soft eggs nor yet become egg-bound. They require much more exercise, and
in this climate fewer nests, and these only during the warmer mouths. As a rule a female
cannot lay three consecutive clutches with impunity. When separated, with common
sense, they will live as long as you like.--K. P.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley.
There are no birds more stately or more ornamental than
the Cranes, especially where they can be given a large space in
which to walk about, where there is a goodly stretch of grass
land on the border of a pond or lake, round which grow sedges,
rushes, and water plants of various kinds ; where clumps of
bamboo and giant spiraeas form backgrounds to the beautiful
Japanese irises, as well as others of that charming species, such
as Iris siberica and the yellow flag.
Where bold groups of pampas grass and Tritoma uvaria,
or, better still, T. nobilis, give fine effects in August; and where
giant ferrels, Polygonums and Osmunda regalis mingle together
to enhance the beautiful effect of a wild garden ; pushing them-
selves above the immense leaves of the Gunnera manicata.
In the water itself, if that splendid annual--the Canadian
rice--can be induced to sprout and root, so much , the better ;
but at any rate the Aponogeton and the many varieties that are
now to be obtained of mauy-lmed water-lilies, will bejewel the
surface, and transform an ordinary pond into a Paradise.
Here if, as I say, the space around is roomy,--for Cranes,
are, in a real flower garden, as is a bull in a china shop--these
magnificent birds can be kept.
You can have sixteen species if you like : the late Lord
Lilford had them all, I believe; but more than that number you
cannot attain to, for the very good reason that there are no more
in all the wide world.
And moreover, some of these are decidedly costly and
difficult to obtain, especially the Wattled Crane of Africa, and
the splendid White-necked Crane of Asia.
At this moment (January, 1901) I am fortunate enough
to possess five species : and these are the)&apos;. First and foremost--

they come first because I have had them longer than the
others--is a pair of Australian ' Native Companions.' Not so
tall as the Sarus Crane of India, but still very tall and very
stately, and very ready to take offence. Very jealous too of
any invasion of their territory, so that no other bird that cannot
fly dares venture beyond a certain point.
The Australians are of a soft French grey, which is set
off--as is the Grey Parrot by his red tail--by a scarlet patch of
warty skin at the back of the head, which edges the greenish
yellow skin on the crown. To see them stride round a visitor,
their bright red-brown eyes looking defiantly, is most entertain-
ing, the sexes shown forth by the demeanour of either bird.
The male takes much longer steps, jerkingly striding, with
uplifted head ; whilst the female, her head held on one side in a
coy manner, sidles about with lowered petticoats; that is to say,
with the elongated feathers of the wings drooping.
" What nice tame birds! " said some one to me not long
ago. "Yes! aren't they?" I answered. What would happen I
well knew, but I kept silence just to see the fun of it. Nearer
and nearer came the Australians, stalking and sidling, until the
male bird being quite close to his visitor, turned his back (a way
he has) and appeared to be admiring the view in the opposite
direction. To stroke his beautiful grey feathers seemed natural,
but even as the hand was outstretched, whish ! he was round like
lightning, fiercely digging with dagger-like bill at the intruder's
trousered legs! Tableau ! And this attack was followed by
exultant and loud trumpeting rattling cries from the Cranes,
telling out their victory to the neighbourhood for quite two miles
round ; at least that, with the wind.
Cranes are long-lived birds, and have been known to exist
for thirty-six years in captivity. Moreover, they are, as a rule,
granivorous, so that their food is cheaper and cleaner than that
of Storks, and Herons, and Ibises, etc. But they are fond of
meat greaves, bread and dog biscuit, not to mention fish, though
they can do without the latter. In the park, by the margin of
the lake, my Cranes pick up a good deal in the way of roots of
grass, either in the water or out.
They love to stand knee - deep in the shallower parts,
where, with their images reflected, they add considerably to the
features of the place. They are very hardy, and the water,
however cold, doesn't seem to give them chilblains. Certainly
they can do without hot-water bottles, unlike ladies of my
acquaintance, who become so parasitical in this respect that
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999518744186046" page_id="10098622"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
they continue to use them even through the summer, whereby
they undoubtedly diminish the strength of the natural circulation
and render themselves more and more subjedl to cold feet.
But the Cranes wade boldly into the icy water.
The Mantchurians are splendid fellows, well-known as
depicted upon Japanese and Chinese screens. At a distance
they have the appearance of giant white Storks, although their
legs and bills are dark lead colour ; for they too are snowy white
with elongated black plumes on the wings, covering their white
tails ; and all this bold simplicity of colouring is set off by a
touch of scarlet skin on the crown of the head. Very tall and
very stately are these Mantchurian Cranes, with loud trumpeting
voices.
When the water of the lake is lowered, which it sometimes
is and easily can be, they' - look extremely picturesque as they
wade about on the watch for the small fish which can be snapped
up in the shallows.
And, at peace with them, there wanders a pair of snow-
white Siberian Cranes, with Flamingo-like pink legs, and bills of
the same tint. The fore-part of their faces has bare scarlet
skin, cut sharply down by the eyes, which are fierce looking and
bright yellow. It is only when they spread their wings, that one
discovers they are not entirely snow white, for the primaries are
black, which doesn't show when the wings are folded. Their
voices are weaker, considerably weaker, than the Mantchurians'
and Australians'; a musical, tremulous, whistling cry.
If it is necessary to catch them, one must charge boldly
into the spot in which you have cornered them, for, with their
.amber-coloured eyes glaring at you close down on either side
of the base of the bill, they show that they intend fighting, and
will strike out like an Italian with his stiletto in double quick
time, and at your face too !
It is a curious sight to see the Siberians swimming, for
they do so every evening in order to roost on the island of the
lake. Once upon a time their ancestors must have swum
altogether, and had shorter legs, for the White Cranes turn
themselves into what looks uncommonly like Pelicans, their
heads low down in the water, and their long legs high up behind,
so that they can better use their feet, duck fashion, for paddling.
They don't give me the idea of being Cranes at all, until they
reach the farther shore, when down go their legs, up go their
heads and bodies, and the Pelican is suddenly transformed into
a tall and stately Crane once more.

Then I have a pair of the Common Crane, which once was
a native of Great Britian, and which is becoming almost as rare
in Europe--more's the pity--as it has become in England.
Smaller, considerably, than the species already described,
but extremely graceful. Dark grey bodies, with black and
white running down the neck, and scarlet skin on the heads, the
distinctive feature of the plumage being the black cock-like
plumes of the elongated wing feathers, drooping over the tail.
They too have a wild sounding, trumpeting note, and they too
can be familiar and fierce, if they like.
But the smallest of all the Cranes is my fifth species, the
lovely Deitioiselle of Africa, India and different parts of Asia.
Delicate pearl grey bodies, with long pointed wing feathers
hanging over the tail, and black feathers depending in a point in
front of the neck, rather like the ends of a lady's boa. Besides
which, this dainty bird is ornamented with silvery white ear-
tufts, growing in a graceful curve on either side of the head, and
bending round to the neck. I wonder which learnt to dance first,
men or Cranes? Cranes, I expect. They are ballet dancers
from their birth, or, if they don't practise as soon as that, at
least their steps and attitudes come to them naturally.
It is supposed that they are the most ancient living
representatives of bird-life, and many a poet of older days has
written about them. Virgil and Homer, par excellence.
A flight of three or four hundred Cranes is a grand sight,
their weird trumpetings sounding from afar, before ever they
come into view.
As fine a species as any is the larger Sams Crane, in which
the head and a large portion of the neck is scarlet with the
curious bare skin, and the plumage is delicate French grey. A
very tall and stately personage.
The Cranes at our Zoological Gardens need more space,
and more artistic surroundings, which is, no doubt, difficult to
give them. They don't look well enclosed in small paddocks,
with a meagre asphalted pool in which to put their toes. They
want a place something like the duck ponds, with stretches of
open lawn, and groups of rushes and reeds. Above all they
want fresh country air, where grimy London soots and smoky
atmosphere cannot besmirch their naturally pure colouring and
smooth plumage. There is a great difference between a country
Crane and a town one, to the latter's disadvantage.
Some species breed fairly readily in captivity, especially
the Great White and Black Man tellurians, and to this event I

am looking forward, for mine are youthful birds. Sometimes I
have my doubts as to their being male and female! They are
so much more of a size than the Siberians or the Australians.

By Wesley T. Page, F.Z.S.
Simultaneously with the November copy of " Avicultural
Magazine," there came to hand the October copy of " Bird
Lore," the official organ of the Audubon Societies of America ;
it contained an article on the Bower-birds of Australia, by Mr.
A. J. Campbell, of Melbourne ; from which I have culled the
following, not quoting in extenso, but abbreviating and in some
instances, givinghis description in my own phraseology, think-
ing the}&apos;' would be of much interest to our members, specially so
just now, Dr. Butler having brought one of them (the Satin-bird)
before our notice in the November issue, " Avicultural Magazine."
If they could be obtained at moderate prices they would
make delightful inmates of our bird rooms, especially the last
two, but they are very rare and I do not think these two have
yet been imported.
The Satin-bird (.Ptilonorhynchus violaceus).
He describes the male as being specially beautiful in his
satin-like, blue-black coat and beautiful violet eyes ; the female
is clad iu a grayish-greenish mottled dress ; which is also the
colour of the young; the adult plumage is not obtained till
the third or fourth year, some say not till the seventh 3 r ear.
It is found principally in the coastal forests of Eastern
Australia; they thrive in captivity, are poor whistlers, yet readily
learn to articulate words, and are good mimics.
He describes the eggs as being of a rich cream colour,
irregularly blotched with brown, nearly if inches long, two
being the usual clutch, but occasionally three are laid.
The nest is usually found at the height of 12ft. in a tree or
bush, constructed of twigs and leaves loosely put together. He
notes as strange the fact that these birds, building so neat a
bower (the walls of which are i2in. high, ioin. long, and 6in.
apart) yet building so slovenly a nest; he further states that
more than one pair of birds frequent the same bower--a lovers'
bower--a rendezvous for match-making.
The Spotted Bower-bird (Chlamydodera metadata ) inhabits

?o
the arid and dry interior provinces. The plumage is of various
shades of brown with beautifully spotted markings ; the male has
a baud or frill on the back of the neck of a beautiful rose-pink
shade; it has a harsh scolding voice, yet it is an admirable
mimic.
The nest, loosely constructed of twigs, is placed in a thick
bush, or on the forked branches of a small tree ; its eggs (two or
three) are beautifully and wonderfully marked (colour not
given). This species adds bones to its bower or play-ground ; as
many as 1,320 bones were counted at one, another had go at
entrance and 92 at rear ; size of bower, walls i2in. high, 2oiu.
long, 7m. apart.
Regent-bird (Sericulus melinus).
He describes this as being one of the most gorgeous birds
that emblazon the sub-tropical scrubs of E. Australia. The
male has strikingly beautiful plumage of black and gold, yellow-
coloured eyes and bill. The female is more soberly clad in a
brownish olive-mottled dress, dark brown eyes and bill.
The eggs (mostly two) are strikingly and beautifully
marked, judging from the illustration ; the colour is not stated.
Its nest is constructed entirely of sticks, and twigs, and is very
difficult to find. The bower comparatively small, 7 or 8 in. high,
7 in. long, in. between walls.
Goeden Bower-bird (Prionodura newtoniana).
This beautiful bird vies in its golden splendour with the
Regent-bird; its home, the rich palm scrubs of Northern
Queensland. A11 authenticated nest has not yet been discovered.
Its bower is a wonderful structure, usually built on the ground
between two trees or tree and bush, constructed of twigs, piled
up round one tree in a pyramid form, 4 to 6 ft. high; a similar
pile 18 in. high, is built round the foot of the other tree, the
intervening space being arched over with stems of climbing
plants; piles and arch are decorated with white moss, the arch
more so with clusters of green fruit, resembling wild grapes ;
scattered around are a number of liut-like erections, giving the
spot the appearance of a miniature blacks' camp.
The illustrations are beautiful reproductions of photo-
graphs of nest and bowers taken in situ , and consist of:
Bower of Satin-bird. Bower of Spotted Bower-bird, shew-
ing sheeps' bones used as decorations. Nest and eggs of Regent-
bird. Bower of Regent-bird.

THE CHINESE SPECTACLE THRUSH.

<bodyText confidence="0.983571214285714" page_id="10098626"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Some three years ago, when in London, I paid Mr. Lner a
visit, as in duty bound, in search of curiosities. His shop, by the
way, is worth a visit, for he generally has something good put
away. I found it so this time ; for, on looking into a certain cage, I
saw a rare bird that at once attracted my attention. He was a fine
ehocolate-colonred fellow, with blue eyes, and curious triangular
spectacle patches round the eyes. I knew at once that I had
before me the Chinese Spectacle Thrush, and I saw he was a fine
cock. I at first hesitated to buy, as I always try to get a pair. I
got Mr. Lner into talk, and he told me he had taken him in
exchange from Mr. Moerscliell, of our Society. I said to myself:
1 Oh, foolish Mr. Moerscliell; some men never recognise their
blessings until they are gone ! ' At the same time I blessed him
for giving me this chance. I asked Mr. Luer if he chanced to
have a hen ; he said he did not know, but he had another
Spectacle Thrush in a cage right up on the sky line. I asked
him to reach it down, and I saw directly I set eyes on it that it
was a hen, and a very good one, too, though shabby in feather.
We soon struck a bargain, and I carried off my two friends at
the end of the week to Yorkshire. I kept them in a big cage for
some weeks until I had got them into condition, as I had to pull
all the hen's flights and tail : they were so badly broken. I then
transferred them to a big garden aviary, which I call the
Wilderness, and where they have remained ever since in the
company of Nonpareils and Indigos. Curiously enough, though
insectivorous birds, they much prefer Indian millet to any soft
food I can put before them, and it seems to agree with them
admirably.
During 1899, they made no attempt at breeding; though
they had the good example of a pair of Nonpareils before them.
They stood all last severe winter with hardly any shelter; but
suffered apparently no inconvenience.
The cock is an excellent singer, and I think he knows it.
The hen sits by and approves by a low gurgle from time to time;
she seems to believe ' that it iz a grate art to know how tew listen.'
I really felt very sorry for these birds last winter, it was so
bitterly cold ; but they apparently held with Emerson that
" All sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together
To make up a year
And a sphere."

I think they are the only birds I know that are always satisfied
with the weather. No matter what the condition of the atmos-
phere, they are contented and happy, and willing to affirm that
the state of things at any given moment is the very best that
could have been desired.
In summer, when the mercury goes bolting up to the
nineties, they peep out of the bushes and look up at the sky,
and say, ' Splendid ! perfectly splendid ! ideal weather for birds
and ice merchants.' In winter, when the mercury goes creeping
down fifteen degrees below zero, and the cold was nearly severe
enough to freeze the inside of Vesuvius solid down to the centre
of the globe, those Thrushes would sit out on a brauch and
exclaim, ' By gracious, did you ever see such weather as this ! I
like au atmosphere that freezes up your very marrer. It keeps
lip the price of coal. Don't talk to me of summer ; give me cold
and plenty of it.' If contentment is happiness, then the life of
these Thrushes is one uninterrupted condition of blessedness.
East year the Thrushes made up their minds to rear a
family ; but so shy and quiet were they about their projected
plans, that I only knew things were ' fixed up ' by finding a nest
by chance which I thought must be theirs. I did it on the
elimination of chance principle. There were only Nonpareils,
Indigoes, and Thrushes in the enclosure. I knew it was not the
nest of a Nonpareil, it was far too large for an Indigo ; what
then could it be but the Spectacle Thrushes' ? However, to be
quite certain I knew I must possess my soul in patience and wait
for eggs.
A morning or two later, on August 13th, to be exact, I
took a casual peep, and lo ! there was au egg in the nest; about
as big as an English Thrush's, but rather rounder, and the same
shade of blue, but without any sort of markings. The eggs
were laid every other day, and the nest is not quite so large as a
Blackbird's, aud made of dry grass and bents beautifully woven
together, and about four feet from the ground. My friend Mr.
Oates was here on August 15th, and I graciously permitted him
a peep, as an old and experienced aviculturist ; and also with a
view to stop all subsequent doubt and gainsaying. If 'Human
happiness consists in having what you want,' I was supremely
happy that August day. I remember reading once 'that Fortune
sometimes shows us the way but it is energy that achieves
success.' I determined that, if care was worth aught, success
should be mine.
I carefully noted the day when the first egg was laid, and
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.989753585365854" page_id="10098628"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
made my plans accordingly : for it takes a lot of calculation to
raise a nest of insectivorous birds. Some folks say that babies
take a lot of rearing ; but I would rather rear ten babies than
one nest of Spectacle Thrushes. I know that Mark Twain says
somewhere that * one baby can furnish more business than you
and your Interior Department can attend to'; but then Mark
had never kept birds! Set him down to rear a nest of young
Spectacle Thrushes and he would alter his view, and not be long
about it either.
I felt a little bit proud over this affair. ' There aint but
phew men who kail stick a whole henkerchief into the brest
pocket ov their overcoat without letting a little ov it stick out--
just by acksident.'
Here my article must end abruptly, for the Thrushes
declined, for some reason, to sit ; but still, as no one, so far as I
know, has ever got so far as eggs, I thought this paper might be
of interest. Next summer, if we all live and things go well, I
hope to record some young Spectacles.
THE BREEDING SEASON, 1900.
By W. H. St. Ouintin.
Without having anything very novel to tell, I am tempted
to send you a few facts relating to last breeding season. It was
an exceedingly late Spring in this district. I did not hear the
first Chiffchaff until April 10th ; while on the same date, I have
a note that, in a plantation on the north side of our Wolds, about
three miles from here, snow that fell in the blizzard of 15th
February was still unmelted !
Amongst the Pheasants etc, running in a large enclosure,
a female Cabot's Tragopan laid two eggs in an old Woodpigeous'
nest nine feet up in a yew tree, and sat steadily. But, as at that
time I had no male of her species, I removed the eggs. A
Grey-hen, after being missing for some ten da} r s, was found
sitting on seven eggs in a nesthole so cleverly scooped out in the
grass, that the bird's back was level with the surface of the
ground, and she was very difficult to see. Although in this case
there was a fine male bird, whose display in the early Spring was
most amusing, these eggs did not hatch, possibly from having
been touched by a night frost before the bird began to sit.
A Pink-footed Goose, tame-bred last year, nested ; but her
eggs were unfertile. But a pair of Whitefronted Geese, which
for the previous three seasons had laid only clear eggs, under

exactly similar conditions, laid six eggs this year in their nest-
site of 1899, and to my surprise hatched four Goslings, rearing
two of them. Of Ducks a good many of the commoner kinds
were reared ; and we succeeded for the first time in bringing up
some Shovellers. These birds appear to require a great deal
more animal food than any other ducklings that we have reared
here, Eiders excepted. Of these last, I am sorry to say that I
have only one old female remaining. At this time last year I
had a fine lot of seven. But in one fortnight during last winter,
two splendid old drakes, one adult duck and two young birds of
the year, all died in what seemed to be apoplectic fits. In four-
teen years I have never lost Eiders in this way; and the reason I
believe to be that by a mistake they were for several weeks
allowed access to grain, including maize, thrown down to other
waterfowl. A careful post mortem examination and analysis
disclosed no other cause but this, which had led to the accumu-
lation of enormous masses of yellow fat about the vital organs.
To complete my misfortune, one of the two surviving ducks got
out of the enclosure, and was caught by a fox the same night.
My Pratincoles, of which I have seven, had suffered a good
deal from frost-bitten feet in the severe weather of the Spring,
for I had no sufficiently warm quarters to offer them. Two pairs
made "scratches," and in each case one bird (probably the male)
sat hard, but no eggs were laid, though no one would have guessed
this who saw the way in which the bird behaved. These birds
make delightful pets, if allowed room to use their wings. Mine
are comfortably housed this winter, and I hope for better results
when the breeding time comes.
Both Diamond Doves and the charming little Painted
Quails reared yoring ones, but neither of the species of Sand-
grouse which laid eggs, Exustus, or Alchatus, hatched. In
the latter case the aviaries had been fresh gravelled, and the
eggs were broken against the small stones, in several instances
with chicks partly formed. It is not easy to hit off the right
kind of soil for these birds. If too sandy, the sides of the rather
deep "scratch" fall in, and the bird never attempts to remove
the sand, but makes a fresh nest.
My beautiful pair of Snowy Owls, now more than nine
years old, laid their first egg on the 26th May ; and the first
young bird was seen on June 29th. Two fine young, one of
either sex, were safely reared. I hope that, if any of my fellow-
members acquire any of these fine birds, they will be very careful
in regard to food.

With Eagle Owls one can take great liberties, either as to
quantity or quality. But it is not so with the far more delicate
" Snowies." They must have what falconers call " castings," at
every meal, that is fur, and small bones. The only easily
obtained food that seems to suit these birds perfectly is rabbit;
and it must be fresh and not tainted in the least, or the Owls will
go amiss. They will not eat birds in confinement, at least that
is my experience, though when at liberty it is otherwise ; and
they are said to feed on Ptarmigan, etc., and sometimes even on
fish. My birds sometimes have freshly-killed young rats or
mice ; but, I repeat, they must not have the rougher food on
which the Eagle Owl will thrive.
A pair of Jays, which I have had for some years, for the
first time nested this summer, on the lid of a basket fixed up in
their aviary. One young one was hatched, but apparently it
died and was removed : for on the old birds deserting the nest a
week later, two eggs were found, each with a young one dead in
the shell. As the Jays are very tame, if they go to nest again, I
intend to leave the aviary door open, so that they may obtain a
supply of natural food.
A MISTAKE.
By Reginald Phillipps.
Years ago, when Stnithidea cbieria was rare--it is almost
common now -- a lady was looking at my birds, and asking
questions about those which took her fancy. Pointing with her
finger, she said, "What is that--that thing up there?" "A
Strutliidea," I replied. "A er-r-r, what?" "A Struthidea ; a
Grey Struthidea from Australia." "Yes, yes," she rejoined
petulantly, " but what is its name? what is it called generally? "
"The Grey Struthidea," I blandly remarked. "But hasn't it
any other name ? " And the only other name I could give was
Struthidea cinerea, which did not tend to soothe her irritation.
She seemed to think that I was humbugging her, or wanted to
show off, for she was unable to comprehend that the species has
not any simple English name.
One day in the spring of 1900, a clerical gentleman, who
lives next door, and has the benefit of the dulcet (and other)
strains that proceed from my aviary, who has many an ear for
music but hardly an eye for a bird, was with us taking tea.
" What bird is it," he asked " that has such a pleasing bubbling

note, like the rippling of running water?" "Oh, that will be
the Pied Grallina," I replied. "I beg your pardon?" "The
Grallina; the Pied Grallina ; that handsome black and white
bird which waves and folds its wings so curiously as it utters a
wild, almost Curlew-like, cry." He shifted uneasily in his chair,
and again suggested that he would like to know the name; but
I could only add, " Grallina picata ; or Grallina australis , as it
is called by the Zoological Society." The gentleman was not
satisfied ; but he had too much self control to unseemingly
betray that he was annoyed, and too much courtesy to pursue
the matter further. Even Mrs. Phillipps, with all her advantages
of close companionship with the bird, a great favourite of hers,
has not taken kindly to his name, but calls him Agricola ; and
by his name of Agricola he is always known between ourselves.
The Grallina is known in Australia as the Little Magpie,
to distinguish it from "The Magpie," as the several species of
Piping Crows are indiscriminately called ; and I am inclined to
think, but am not sure, that it is identical with the " Mud Lark"
of some parts of the Australian Continent. The names are not
recognised in this country, however, and rightly not, for they
are misleading, as the bird has nothing of the Magpie about it
but the pied coat, and nothing whatever of the Lark that I can
perceive.
Since his last moult, my Grallina has been an exception-
ally handsome bird, and as graceful and elegant as he is
handsome. The white body and other parts are of the purest
white, and the blue-black glossy and brilliant. A specimen of
the species, likewise a male, may be seen in the Western
Aviaries at the Zoological Gardens--if nothing has happened to
him since I was there last. We each obtained a pair in 1899 ;
but neither female recovered from the effects of the journey, &amp;c.,
whilst each male keeps in perfect health and condition.
O11 21 st August, 1900, I secured a pair of very active,
lively, short-legged, uncommon looking birds of a species which,
I think, has not been seen in this country for many years. It
conies from the Himalayas, and is of a chestnut-red colour set
off with black and a touch of white, of rather small size, and
goes bobbing and bounding about the aviary like an India-rubber
ball, sometimes with the head, ofttimes with the tail, uppermost.
The sexes are nominally alike, and both are attractive, the male
conspicuously so when he raises his crest and salutes his lady,
or holds himself up by her side in stately dignity ; and he is
cpiite a musical box in the variety of his call notes and warblings

when the two get accidentally separated. Their favourite
occupation before the winter set in seemed to be darting into the
air after the smallest gnats and winged insects, which they
practically never failed to catch ; but they mainly rely on their
spring for taking their prey, never flying like a Flycatcher.
Although often visiting low thickets, they rarely go actually on
to the ground, unless momentarily after water or some insect.
They are fond of grapes, and know a good pear when they meet
with one.
I doubt if these birds would be an unmixed joy in a cage,
or even in a small aviary, because of their restless disposition
and nervous temperament; and for some weeks after their arrival
I feared they would prove to be a nuisance. But now that they
have settled down, it is quite different, and if possible I grow
fonder of them every day. Their great affection for one another
is a pleasing trait to note ; and in this and other ways they
betray affinity with the smaller Jay-Thrushes. They are very
noticeable, and seldom fail to attract the attention of visitors,
and "Oh! what is that bird!" in one form or another, is the
usual cry. In vain I assure my friends that it is a Sibia, the
Black-headed Sibia (Sibia capistrata ; or Malarias capistrata, as
per Cat. Birds Brit. Museum) from India. They vacantly remark,
"Yes, it has a black head," and add, under their breath, various
improper words. Mrs. Phillipps, in this case also, from the first
declined to recognise the title af Sibia; but she knows all about
the Sibyls,--and as a Sibyl is the bird usually spoken of here.
It seems to me that we make a mistake by failing to give
the birds, as far as practicable, simple English names, not names
which are misleading and disseminate error, such as " Hedge
Sparrow," " Mud Lark," and " Little Magpie," nevertheless
names that can be taken hold of and remembered, comfortably
handled, and carried to our homes. We ought to try and lift
our less fortunate brothers and sisters above the " Dickie-bird "
level, and induce them to take an intelligent interest in our
feathered friends, and not choke them off with Struthideas,
Grallinas, Sibias, and a host of such like titles. A similar
thought (page 61), or one akin to it, seems to have been forced up-
on the mind of our enthusiastic fellow aviculturist Miss Alderson,
by the trouble and inconvenience occasioned her, and doubtless
others, through the English language being sometimes ignored
in our Magazine. I once heard a cabinet naturalist affirm that
he did not know a species by what some are pleased to call its
trivial name. But that is not true aviculture ; it is much the

reverse. No one can admire and value the study of other
languages, dead or otherwise, and the importance, nay, the
necessity, of scientific classification and nomenclature, more
than I do, but I fail to see eye to eye with those who speak
slightingly of their own mother tongue. And we should not
act so as to disgust and repel the embryo aviculturist, but rather
do the best that may be done to win and assist him.
Let us close by returning to the original line of thought,--
and admit that it is now impossible to do much towards simpli-
fying the names of certain foreign birds ; nevertheless we may
well keep the idea before our minds, and act accordingly should
any opportunity of doing so present itself (a).

EFFECTIVE SIMPLE BIRD TRAPS.

By Arthur G. Butler, Pli.D.
Now that the purchase of even the commoner British
birds has been rendered difficult, owing to the many and per-
plexing local restrictions which have grown out of the Wild
Birds' Protection Act. the only chance of the British aviarist is
to be his own bird-catcher: this he can only hope to be upon his
personal property, so that the idea of clap-nets and even bat-
fowling nets must (unless he be a large lauded proprietor) be
set aside.
In the early days of my bird keeping, before I had come
across a bird-catcher, and long before the utopian fiction that
the preservation of a few thousand birds in the British Isles
would affect their permanent representation on our shores, had
gained ground with a gullible public ; I used to catch all the
commoner birds with two very simple, cheap, and easily made
traps, known as the box-trap and caravan-trap.
Before describing these contrivances, it will perhaps save
future discussion if I point out that only in severe weather,
when our wild birds are dying from starvation, are any traps of
much use; and to catch and care for birds at such times (far
from being cruel) is the greatest kindness that you can show
them. It is well-known that birds are purely animal in their
passions and desires; therefore, in a good-sized aviary, where
they can carry on a natural life without the dangers of absolute
(a.) I am quite at one with Mr. Phillipps in this opinion ; indeed X go further, for I
think it our duty not to accept nonsense names for any bird for which we can suggest a
descriptive name : on this ground I have objected to the terms ' Picui ' dove, ' Picuzuro '
pigeon, &amp;c. as conveying no meaning to Englishmen.--A. G. B.

freedom, they are far more likely to pass a happy existence than
if subjected to all the risks and torments which untra mmelled
Nature provides for her children.
In the second place, as regards the protection of wild
birds; if those who imagine that the prevention of birdsnesting,
bird-catching, (as practised in Great Britain during the past
century), or even shooting (as practised by ornithologists) is of
any avail, would only study the subject and reflect a little, they
would see that this notion is utterly ridiculous : as well might
they believe that the sands of the sea shore might be exhausted
by the efforts of trippers' children with their toy pails. Those
who can credit such nonsense can have no conception of the
countless myriads of birds which pass over our Islands ever}&apos; 1
spring, and only pass away from us because we have destroyed
and are still destroying the natural homes in which they once
delighted. By denying the aviculturist the pleasure of studying
British birds in cage and aviary, the peasantry of Italy and Spain
have a few more Nightingales, Robins, Skylarks, and other
sweet singers to eat; but we gain nothing for England excepting
blind faith in an ever receding millennium of bird life. It is
pretty certain that bird life in our country was never so varied
or so prolific as during the Middle Ages, when every male, so
soon as he could toddle, began to make war upon the feathered
family; when every ingenious contrivance for their capture was
used both by day and night throughout the year.
The box-trap which is very effective in the capture of
Blackbirds, Thrushes, and many of the small birds of our
gardens costs about threepence to construct. You get au
ordinary deal box from a grocer for about i#d., taking care that
you get the lid with it. The latter you saw across at about three-
fifths of its length, nailing down the longer length, across the
centre of the underside of the shorter length ; you screw a lath
which projects about half its length behind the wood and is
bevelled off at the end ; the loose portion of lid is then put in
position and hinged with thin leather or even tape tacked on
each side. An ordinary penny wire spring with one end fastened
through the edge of the lid, and the other carried from within
outwards through the side of the box, so as to keep the lid firmly
closed, completes the trap, which then only requires a crutch
with a notch cut in it to be ready for use.
To set the trap the lid is raised, the end of the crutch
rested against the end of the box inside, the fork being under
the opening, the end of the lath which crosses the lid is inserted

in the notch, and the spring retains all in position : either stand
on a step or bury in the earth, sprinkling fine breadcrumbs
outside--and large inside the trap : as the bird jumps down he
knocks away the crutch and the lid closes. A small piece of
glass let into the back of the trap is advantageous, as it enables
you to see what you have caught: I used to set these traps over-
night, and sometimes found various species of mice in them in
the morning.
The caravan-trap is based upon a sixpenny iron hoop with
one portion flattened, so that it represents an elongated D 1
across this, from the two corners to the opposite sides, are bent
two wires arching somewhat and united in the centre; over these
and fastened all round the hoop is string netting. Inside and
loosely wired to the corners of the D at its extremities is an arch
formed of a bent apple-twig or strip of thin cane ; a crutch, and
a second piece of apple-twig complete the trap.
To set this trap the flat back of the D is loosely fastened
to the earth by iron hooks or bent wire ; the crutch is firmly
driven into the earth outside of and just beyond centre of the
ring ; the latter is raised at an angle of about 45 degrees, the
inner ring is also held about two inches above the earth: this is
easily done by inserting one end of the loose apple-twig through
the front of the netting over the fixed crutch, then back and
behind the edge of the lower hoop. Crumbs are thrown inside,
and the birds release the sustaining apple-twig as they pass over
the lower hoop, a touch of the tail being often sufficient.
One advantage of the caravan trap is that it rarely catches
old birds : these are too cunning, and leap clean over the lower
hoop, take a good feed and hop back again. To make sure of
them, in spite of this trick, one has to lay two slender twigs
across from the lower hoop to the centre.
The caravan-trap is admirable for most of our common
garden songsters, but unfortunately one has to watch it constantly
on account of the Starlings. No birds are so utterly foolhardy
as Starlings, and no sooner is your trap set than in they go,
sometimes three together, and seem quite astonished when they
find themselves under a net. I caught thirteen one morning,
turned them all together into a large cage, and in the morning
when they were quieter I selected the three best and let the
others fly ; later I selected the best of the three and kept him
for show : he was the most perfectly-formed Starling I ever saw--
a long close-feathered active snaky bird;--but I did not force
him into colour before his. time, therefore he was ignored in

iavour of two squat unnatural looking birds (in breeding plumage
in early February): that experience sickened me finally of keep-
ing British birds for show-purposes : natural birds are a bit off
colour now-a-days at our shows, yet I believe my Starling has
been a winner since he left my hands.
CORRESPONDENCE.
AVICULTURAL NOTES.
Sir, -- The first number of the "Avicultural Magazine" published in
the new century is graced by three most interesting articles, written by
ladies, members of the Society. This is indeed a good beginning.
Lady Dunleatli mentions her Californian Quails: which reminds me
of my experience with these pretty inmates of my outdoor aviary. I had
a pair which lived in a garden aviary stocked with Canaries. The hen
Quail began to lay eggs, aud I made her a nest of sods of turf in a corner
and under cover. The cock bird was much interested in this nest and
used to sit on its rim, but the hen laid an egg daily, anywhere on the
ground, except in the nest. These eggs were daily put in the nest, which
the cock bird watched faithfully.
I forget now whether eleven or thirteen eggs were laid. But the hen
showed no inclination to sit, and one day the cock sat down on the eggs
and remained there, hatching the whole brood ; and when the chicks came
out he fed them as carefully as any lieu would do, rearing the whole lot. I
believe this case is bv no means unique, probably not even rare, but it is a
curious and pretty sight. The young Californian Quails are very small,
and run about as quickly as mice.
As food for newly-hatched birds, I found it an excellent plan to send
im* gardener into the fields to dig up an anthill and put the earth, ants,
aud larvae into a bag, which was emptied in the aviary. The old and the
3&apos;OUng birds scratched and hunted for ants' eggs and ants, and ate both
with great delight and advantage. For very young birds I would prefer the
yolk of fresh boiled eggs to the preserved }-olk. The latter is very good,
but the former is perhaps more digestible for the tender stomachs of newly-
hatched birds.
Writing about preserved eggs reminds me of something which may
interest some of the readers of the Magazine. I believe I am the innocent
inventor of this preserved egg-food. It happened as follows: -- When the
brilliant coal-tar aniline dyes were brought out they were very costly, and
chiefly used for printing delicate flower designs on muslins, destined to be-
come ladies'summer frocks. To thicken and fix these colours, egg albumen
was used, as being the most suitable gum and not affecting the most delicate
tints. The white of eggs, when boiled, becomes a white leather}&apos; insoluble
mass ; but when dried at a slow heat, it becomes a very fine soluble gum,
which is pure albumen. A friend of mine bought annually millions of eggs
in Hungary, to make albumen from the white, but did not know what to
do with the yolk of the eggs. He offered it by the hundred-weight and the
ton to pastry cooks and to leather dressers; he tried to salt it, and he tried

<bodyText confidence="0.988635804347826" page_id="10098637"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
to invent candied yolk of eggs ; but nobody would have it. I suggested to
him to preserve the yolk by simply evaporating the moisture in it at a low
heat, and in a chamber from which the air was exhausted, whereby very
rapid evaporation at a low heat without the alteration of chemical combi-
nation of substances, resulting from cooking, becomes possible. My friend
acted on the suggestion, and the product entirely answered my expectation
of proving a very useful food for rearing pheasants, bringing up chickens,
and as a food for cage birds. Where the thus-preserved yolk of eggs is
now made, I do not know : the albumen is supplanted by cheaper materials,
although the Chinese offer it at a fraction of the price for which it is made
in Europe, and the Hungarian eggs are sent to London in their shells.
Pray excuse this digression. Aug. F. Wiener.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir, --Amongst all the suggestions offered for the treatment of the
Gouldian Finch, I never see the use of rock salt recommended. I always
keep my Gouldians,&amp;quot; both in cage and aviary, supplied with a lump ; and
frequently splash a little water over it, and the birds quickly descend from
their perches and lick the moistened surface with their tongues.
As to 'green food,' my Gouldians eat freely chickweed and shepherd's
purse (when in seed), also the annual meadow-grass [Poa anna), the tufts of
which may be pulled up by the roots in any ill-kept pathway, at any time
of the year. A little egg-shell, crushed into small bits in the hand and
thrown upon the ground, is also much appreciated. I have great faith in
rock salt, and plenty of lime in the shape of cuttle-bone and egg-shell;
and I never have a case of egg-binding. My birds are all in first-rate
condition and colour, and the young ones invariably acquire the adult
plumage at their first moult. W. H. St. Quintin.
LAVENDER FINCHES.
Sir, -- I have pleasure in replying to Mr. Pliillipps' query in the
Januar}' Magazine as to the colours of my hen Lavender Finch.
I have never found the colour of the plumage a distinguishing mark
of the sexes. The breeding hen that died was just the same colour as the
cock bird. Many Lavenders, after moulting, assume a much deeper shade
(for a short time) than before--sometimes .the plumage is quite sootj&apos;.
A much surer test is the size and build of the bird. As far as my
experience goes, the cock is always both larger and longer-, the lieu is
invariably smaller and much rounder looking. It is hard to see the
difference if you look at the birds singty. but when together the contrast is
immediately apparent.
Mr. Pliillipps may be interested to hear that my lame Sliama, " Phil,"
is in lovely plumage. He is very well and cheerful, and just getting into
song. His leg w r as broken so close to the body that it seemed impossible
to bind it; and, as he refused to eat and seemed gradually sinking, we
thought that the only chance of saving him was to have the leg amputated.
I was much interested in Mr. Pliillipps'article on " Accidents." If
he would kindly tell us how he bandages the broken limb, and if he uses

many members of the Society. Rosie ALDERSON.
THE PIED GRALLINA.
Sir, -- I noticed that, in bis article upon "Accidents," in the January
"Avicultural Magazine," Mr. R. Phillipps mentioned that be bad got a
ben Pied Grallina. I should be glad if be, or any of your readers, would
kindly inform me if they are easily procurable now, and if they are good
birds for Exhibition purposes.
In the end of 1S9S, I procured a pair through the Keeper of the
Western Aviary at the Zoo ; and I understood from him at the time that
my birds and a pair at the Zoo were the only living specimens in the
country. I also remember seeing a young pair (b) advertised in the
"Avicultural Magazine," in 1S99.
I am sorry to say that I missed shewing mine at the Crystal Palace in
1899, and that they both died before I bad shewn them elsewhere.
Chas. Cushny.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Cushny :
Excepting my own bird, which I advertised some mouths ago because
it was noisy and shewed an inclination to peck at other inmates of the
aviary, I doubt if a single specimen of the Pied Grallina has been offered
for sale in this country since 1899. Probably 7 my bird, and the one at the
Zoological Gardens if still to the fore, are the only living specimens in the
United Kingdom at the present moment.
You seem to be one year out in your dates, as it was in 1899, not 1898,
that some of these Grallinas arrived in England. Moreover, my bird is a
male. If you will kindly refer again to the article quoted, you will see that
the sex is not mentioned. The sexes are readily distinguishable as--not to
mention other points of difference--in the male, the forehead and throat
are black, in the female, white.
In another article, forwarded to the Editor a few days ago, I have
again referred to this species, giving some further particulars that may
interest you. I am glad to be able to say that my Grallina has quite given
up pecking at its neighbours, and is now a general favourite. It makes a
capital aviar)t bird, and keeps its plumage splendidly ; nevertheless I cannot
think that the Pied Grallina would be a good bird for Exhibition purposes.
It is nervous, a very shy feeder, and does not seem to be able to stand much
knocking about. It is perpetually hovering and floating about in the air,
or stalking about on the ground, and is, in my opinion, quite unsuitable for
cage life. Reginald Phillipps.
ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL.
Sir, --We have had very few articles in the Magazine on this branch
of aviculture ; but I feel sure there must be many of our members who
are interested in the numerous beautiful species of foreign Waterfowl, most
of which may be kept in captivity in this country with little trouble, and
will well repay their owner by their charming ways and great beauty.

A most useful little work by the Hon. Rose Hubbard, entitled
"Ornamental Waterfowl," was published in jSSS, but is now out of print so
that probably few of our members have seen it. I was very glad to read in
the " Bazaar," of Jan. 9th last that, as a great many enquiries have been
received for this work since the old edition was exhausted, the author
would bring out a new and enlarged edition if sufficient promises of
support were received to make it worth her while. The old edition
contained an account of every known species at the time, with full
directions for their successful management in captivity; and if a new
edition is brought out, it will doubtless be quite up to date.
It seems to me that it would be a great pity if the author were
compelled to abandon the idea of bringing out the new edition for lack
of a suitable number of subscribers, for we can ill afford to miss this
opportunity of adding a really useful work to our avicultural libraries.
All correspondence on the subject should be addressed to the Hon.
Rose Hubbard, Seven Gables, Winslow, Bucks. D. Seth-SmiTH.
KINGFISHERS.
Sir,--A t a recent Welsh Show I saw a very lovely young specimen of
the Common Kingfisher, in splendid condition and remarkably steady,
which, I was informed, was only one of 13 (or 18) young birds caught and
brought to maturity by the exhibitor. They are rather plentiful on
our Welsh rivers, but I assume they are difficult to tame and keep in
captivity.
If any member would like one, I could doubtless procure it at a
reasonable price, and would willingly try. J. VlNER LEEDER.

Sir, -- I have received the enclosed bird-skin from a nephew, who is
some distance inland near Lovada, on the Portuguese West Coast of Africa.
Can you give me the name of it in the next issue of the " Avicultural
Magazine?" I have written him to bring me a live specimen, if at all
possible, when next he visits Europe.
Some years ago he brought me some specimens of Wiener's Finches
and Violet-eared Waxbills amongst some common birds. He left Eovada
with about 150 and brought about sixty alive. He, however, knew nothing
of the treatment of birds, but has since taken an interest in them.
F. Moerscheee.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Moerschell.
Your bird, as I supposed when I received it, is one of the African
Cuckoos ( Clirysococcyx smaragdinens) of Swainson.
From the form of the bill, the bird is probably largely insectivorous,
and would, I should think, be no more difficult to import than a Bulbul.

Sir,--I shall be very much obliged if you could let me have a short
list of the commoner kept birds which have not yet been bred in this
country, as I am anxious to win the medal.
Has the Dhyal-bird been bred in captivity ?
R. Franklin-Hindle.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Hindie.
It would need a great deal of work to make a list of the commoner
birds which have not been bred in this country. In the finches, less has
been done with Whydahs and Weavers than with any others.
Mr. Farrar (in Vol. V. of the Magazine) told us that he had hatched
out Dlival-birds; but whether he has succeeded in rearing any I cannot sav :
probably not, or we should have heard of it. (c)
The Yellow Wagtail and some of our English Warblers would be
good species to experiment with : I have not heard of their being bred in
captivity in Great Britain. A. G. Butler.

Sir, --Are Black-headed Connies rare ? as they are not mentioned in
Dr. Greene's book on Parrots. Where do they come from, and would they
be likely to nest if placed in a room with other birds ?--M. M. Hamilton.
The following reply hits been sent to Mrs. Hamilton.
In answer to your question, the Black-headed Conure is not a rare
bird, to judge from the frequency of its inclusion in the advertisements of
dealers as the "Neuday Parrakeet."
The fact that it is not described in Dr. Greene's book is probably due
to the said work never having been completed. According to the Catalogue
of the British Muesum the habitat of the Conurus nenday is Paraguay.
I should think Conures most unlikely to breed in a room with other
birds, and I should not be inclined to trust small birds with them.

Quantities of Parrakeets' eggs are spoilt by being laid on a flat surface :
they get scattered about instead of being all in a bunch, as they would be if

SMALL FOREIGN BIRDS AND OTHERS OUT OF DOORS.

Sir, --I quite agree with Mr. Page that all foreign seed-eating birds
do much the best out of doors, all the year round; also that thickly-
planted aviaries are far and away the best, for they not only afford
natural shelter from the elements, but also screen the birds from obser-
vation and so induce them to breed. Mr. Farrar's wonderful success should
be proof enough for anyone : I am now taking a leaf out of his book, and
planting some of my aviaries as thickly as I can.
I do not war with the elements, for I can't say that they do me a
great deal of harm; but I do war with the mice, and these I find my
great enemy, for they not only disturb the birds, but they eat up the seed
and, moreover, they kill the young and suck the eggs. Ivlv cat is ready
everv morning and follows me when I go to feed the birds, for she well
knows where a good feed is likely to turn up, and she generally gets it.
I find little gin traps far the best for catching mice but, of course,
you can't set them inside the aviary unless they are covered up. Sunflower
seeds are the best baits for mice.
F&apos;or indoor bird-rooms, I have noticed that it is necessary to have the
top lights, if any, of a flat pitch : the sun's rays do not then strike at such
an angle as to overheat the place, as they will do if at a pitch such as is
usual in a greenhouse. I once saw a greenhouse with a very flat roof, and
the plants did simply splendidly in it; they were close up to the glass, and
the sun did not burn them ; moreover, the temperature could be better
regulated, and there was not the burning up in the day nor starvation at
night. It is just the same in a bird-room with top lights.
I have just invested in Dr. Butler's excellent book on foreign birds.
I find he recommends artificial heat in winter, and I fancy a good many
will not agree with him on this point. His idea of fountains with glass
receivers sounds nice and clean ; but what about frost, and where is the
foothold for the birds ? His cement sides a foot high and faced with tiles
I consider quite useless--I mean as to the tiles; the cement is all right and
should go well into the ground to prevent vermin undermining it; but
mice can easily jump a foot high, so tiles would only be a waste of expense.
Summer and Winter quarters are not necessary so long as a good shed is
provided, with plenty of branches and furze bushes hung about, and plenty
of trees, bushes, and evergreens are planted in the foreground.

A NESTING PARROT.
Sir,--I t may interest your readers to hear of a nest built by a Parrot

for some months in a cage. Last June it escaped, and its feathers havin
grown again, it flew to a farm belonging to Mr. W. F. Rawnsley, of Par
Hill, Lyndhurst, where it has remained flying about the place and feedin
with the fowls. During the summer it set about building a kind of nest
on the thatched roof of the farm house, nipping off long twigs of hawthorn
for the purpose from a hedge near at hand. Since the colder weather
began, the bird has greatly added to this nest, and uses it as a shelter,
often lying in it by day and always sleeping in it.
The nest is now a tunnel, about 18 inches deep, coming straight out
from the thatch, and partly supported by a chimney stack. It has a
cup-shaped opening about the size of a cocoa-nut. It is very firmly and
compactly woven, and is entirely made of hawthorn twigs. High winds do
not affect it, and rain cannot beat into it; the only thing to be feared
is a heavy fall of snow.
I suppose the bird to be Psittacus murinus ( e) ; its colouring and general
appearance agree with the description of that species bv Bechstein, except
that this bird's tail is certainly more than five inches long, nearer eight, I
should think. Though shy with strangers, it is quite tame to the farmer&apos;s
wife, and will feed from her hand.
I shall be glad if you can tell me : --
1st. Is it usual for Psittacus to build nests of this description ?
2nd. If the nest is only a shelter, or whether, if a mate could be
obtained, the birds would be likely to breed in it ?
3rd. Is there an}&amp;quot; difference in the plumage of the sexes, and is this
one likely to be a cock or hen bird ?
4th. Can it survive an ordinary winter in a sheltered spot in the
South of England ? Ethel F. Chawner.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Chawner.
Miss Chawner's letter is very interesting. I have no doubt the
Parrot is the one she supposes, viz., Myopsittacus monachus, as the British
Museum Catalogue calls it. This is the way it builds. I should expect it
to be a female. It would, no doubt, be quite hardy. Were a mate
provided, they would probably breed. I should advise a cock bird being
hung up near when it is warmer.
I am not aware of any difference in the sexes. F. G. Dutton.

Sir, --For the encouragement of anyone who, like myself, cannot
manage to give their little birds artificial light. I should like to record the
fact, that I have for some years kept the little Waxbills and exotic Finches
successfully, with no other light than that which the sun bestows--which
certainly is not much just now.
When I first started my bird room, the birds I had were all confined
in cages, and I gave myself a good deal of trouble and anxiety in providing
artificial light for them, as I was quite under the impression that our long-
winter nights would be too much for them otherwise.

Another winter came, and by that time my birds had increased in
number, and I had improved their room so that the tiny inoffensive ones
might fly free--this added to my difficulty in safely providing them with
candles--I had no gas at that time and considered lamps dangerous, my
bird room being some distance from the house.
I ventured to consult a gentleman--a member of our present Society
--whom I had previously found most kind and courteous in giving me
advice and answering mv questions, although I was, at that time, a
complete stranger to him. He thought artificial light unnecessary, and
laid stress on the fact that, during the time of rest, food was not required.
Gladly acting on this opinion, I left my little birds to nature, and have
found, so far, that really through the dark winter time I have lost fewer
than at other times. Indeed, I do not recall one death during the darkest
period, either last winter or that before. I have found the early spring
more trying. This is the fourth winter they have had no artificial light.
My little room is now warmed bv one of Mr. Abrahams' stoves (gas),
and the temperature is seldom much over 50 deg. in winter. I think
myself fortunate when the thermometer keeps up to 45 deg. during the
night. When the weather is really winterly it goes down a good many
degrees, and was below 40 many of the cold nights last February. But my
Gouldiau Finch did not appear to suffer, neither did a hen Corden Bleu, nor
any of the tiny Waxbills.
I keep the Gouldians and a few other delicate birds in large cages,
and cover the tops and about nine inches of the fronts at night with baize;
this makes a warm shelter for the little things to sleep under, and leaves
the rest of the cage to benefit from the first rays of light in the morning.
Some of the little mites which fly free like to creep under the baize
at the top of a Crystal Palace Aviary; some perch on the nursery guard
which protects the stove, and others go into the rush nests provided for
them.
All religiously go to bed with the sun. At this time (Dec. 29th) I
pay them their good-night visit punctually at 10 minutes before 4 o'clock,
and find all the free members of my feathered family assembled at that
time on the feeding shelf, busily engaged in eating a good supper.
If I am many minutes making the arrangements for the night, I
have the pleasure of seeing them all retiring to bed, and find each
individual little bird is most jealous over his own sleeping place and very
impatient if I get in his way. I do not think any of them would be at
all pleased if I disturbed them with lamps or candles. This letter sounds
egotistical from a writer who can lay no claim to scientific knowledge--
much as she respects that knowledge in others--but there may be members
of our Society, who have had less experience than myself, to whom it may
be a comfort to know that it is quite possible to keep their little pets
indoors during the winter, without providing light for them at night.
At the time of writing, I have a little Orange-cheeked Waxbill in my
room which has been in my possession 8 years and 4 months.

DEMOISELLE CRANES.
By the Hon. Gerald Lascelles.
A few notes as to the nesting of my Demoiselle Cranes
may perhaps interest readers of the " Avicultural Magazine," even
though no successful result was attained ; and possibly some of
the members may be able to give me a few hints as to the best
steps to take for rearing the young, should my Cranes lay again
this year.
I procured these Cranes from a London dealer in Novem-
ber, 1898. They were rather rough in feather but in good health.
I turned them out, closely pinioned of course, in the small park
or field of about six acres which is in the front of this house.
They settled down in a very short time and have thriven well
ever since. They share this field (in which there is a small
pond) with a number of poultry and a small collection of water-
fowl. With these they agree very well and neither species
interferes with the other. Their food is much the same as that
of the fowls--viz., maize, wheat, broken dog biscuit, and scraps
from the house. In summer they practically maintain them-
selves, but in winter they will come readily to the whistle for
food, and are quite as tame as the game fowls running with them.
They moulted out beautifully in 1899, and, except for
being pinioned, were in absolutely perfect plumage. Their
loud but not unmusical note is most frequent when rain or a
change of weather is impending; at such times they become rest-
less and inclined to try to take wing. And there is always a
chorus from the two of them at the extreme close of the day just
before darkness sets in, which the whole household recognises
as the " evening hymn."
In 1899 the}&apos;- gave no signs of breeding, nor was there
any apparent difference between the two that would enable me
to form an opinion as to whether they were a pair or not. But
in the spring of last year we noticed certain gestures on the part

of one bird which decidedly looked as if a cock bird was playing
up to a hen. They are both, however, so fond of jumping and
dancing absurd quadrilles with each other that it was not easy
to be certain as to these movements.
On one of the last days of April, however, an egg made
its appearance. It was laid on the bare ground without any
pretence at a nest, and in the centre, and most exposed part of
the park. Had it not been that one or other bird stood sentry
over it, the egg might have escaped notice. However, three
days afterwards the second egg made its appearance, and in two
days more, regular incubation commenced. We then put a few
hurdles round the nest to protect it from cows, etc., and this did
not disturb the birds at all. Both parents took their turn at
sitting with great regularity, but the lion's share was allowed to
fall to the hen, while the cock stood sentry and did his best to
drive off any intruders. Their actions, when any strangers
entered the field, were most interesting. The hen--or which-
ever bird was sitting--would immediately leave the nest, and,
just calling to the other, would walk quietly and unconcernedly
away as if there was no nest and nothing interesting inside the
hurdles. But if the stranger approached nearer the birds would
return closer, and the hen would flutter away along the ground
as if both wings were broken, crawling slowly in front of him
right to the fence of the field. But if this device failed, the
cock would throw off all disguise, and, if the intruder approached
the nest, would boldly attack him with wings spread and feathers
erect, screaming loudly the while ; he would strike with his bill
at a man ; and a cow or strange dog would be fairly hustled off
the premises in terror.
The eggs were very large considering the size of the
Crane's body, almost as large as a turkey's egg, and in colour
very like those of the Green Plover, except that the dark brown
markings at the larger end were not so large or so distinct. They
lay always side by side, the smaller ends both pointing the
same way.
Incubation was steadily carried on for twenty-eight days,
and on May 30th the first young Crane appeared. Its advent
was heralded by the close sitting of the mother, and the positive
fury of the sire if any living thing drew near the nest. The
quitting of the eggs and feigned lameness were abandoned, but
were made up for by the violence of the protecting guard. On
the following day, May 31st, the second egg hatched, this bird
being rather weaker than the first.

The appearance of the young was (except for the greater
size) very much that of a young Green Plover, viz., a dark buff
on the back shading off to cream colour, and with black or very
dark brown markings. From the first few hours they followed
the old birds all over the field just as chicks do their mother,
but with this difference, that every scrap of food was, in the
case of the Cranes, collected by the old bird and placed with
the bill into the gaping mouth of the young. In this waj&apos; they
traversed the whole park, every moment collecting some insect
and with it supplying the wants of the young birds running
beside them. The difficulty, which I had foreseen from the first,
would be to provide a sufficient supply of insect food to main-
tain the whole family. To assist this matter I imported ants'
eggs in numbers, but the old Cranes seemed afraid of the ants
among the eggs, and did not use them as I had hoped. We also
gave them scalded meal mixed with egg, and in fact all forms of
Pheasant food ; but though the old Cranes would, under ordinary
circumstances, gorge themselves with such diet, they only used
it sparingly with the young birds. One of these, always weakly,
added to its troubles by walking into the pond, unwatched by
the parent that was also its guardian (for each one of these
interesting birds took charge all the time of one chick, and
devoted all its energies to the maintenance of its section). On
the third day this weakly chick died ; but its brother went on so
bravely and strong that we all thought the trouble was over, and
that for the first time on record the Demoiselle Crane would be
reared in confinement.
But on about the tenth day he suddenly failed--from no
evident cause, and without previous drooping. And by night-
fall he was dead, but not before the interesting family group
had been immortalised by the aid of the camera ( a ).
The difficulty no doubt was the insufficiency of proper
food--insect food as it ought to be ; unless a better plan would be
to risk an enclosure of the birds while incubating and giving
them abundance of custard, meal, and such food as they them-
selves love, on which to bring up their young without seeking
to find their natural food by roaming all day. But would this
answer for the young birds ? And, failing this, how can I
supplement the insect life of the soil so as to provide what
evidently failed this year ? It would probably answer better if
this could be done; and, moreover, nothing could be more
{a). We have received a charming&apos; photo from the Author, which we hope to get
reproduced for au early number of the Magazine.--O. E. C.

interesting than to watch the indefatigable work of the old
Cranes as they collected every scrap of insedt food on their way,
while the little chicks kept running with open mouth to have
each morsel dropped in as the old hunter captured it.
If your readers can give me any hints for guidance in the
future that may, I hope, arise, I shall be supremely grateful (#).

THE SOLOMON ISLAND COCKATOO.

<bodyText confidence="0.997870714285714" page_id="10098647"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
In the July number of the " Avicultural Magazine" I saw
an advertisement of two Red-eyed Cockatoos for sale. At first I
took no notice ; but about the middle of the month I bethought
me of the Solomon Islanders, and wrote to ask, if still unsold,
whether the owner would kindly let me hear about them. In
reply I received a most courteous letter telling me that the
birds were at least 18 years old ; that for the last nine years
they had been kept in a cage and were consequently in bad feather ;
that they destroyed a bundle of firewood every day; that they
had just laid two eggs (at least the lady had) ; that they had been
given cotton wool to make a nest with, and that either in intense
indignation or utter disgust they had scattered eggs and material
all over the cage bottom ; that one egg had disappeared, and that
the other had been sent to me. It came duly to hand, but was
fractured ; still it showed me the size and shape : it was about
the same size as an ordinary Pigeon's egg, and rather obtuse in
shape.
The gentleman said that, if I liked to have them, I could,
and might keep them until either they got into form or went to
nest again. In an unthinking moment, I closed with what I
thought a most generous offer. From that day my sorrows
began, and have continued with fair regularity ever since.
Before I tell you what they are like, I will make a
digression. Full of wicked unsanctified pride, I wrote to my
friend Mr. Savage to tell him of my good fortune. His reply
was laconic and to the point. He thought that " if the hen had
really laid on the bottom of a cage and used a nest of cotton wool,
she ought to be relegated to the animal kingdom of asses " ! and
(#). A most interesting and valuable experience May I suggest mealworms and
cockroaches? It would be very difficult to obtain a full supply; but they would supple-
ment the supply of natural food obtainable by the parents; and a few "carcases" might
be hung up, out of which the maggots would fall to the ground.--R. P.
I would suggest au abundance of earthworms and fine raw meat, but I have not had
practical experience.--J. I,. B.

lie further expressed his opinion that "such an easy-minded bird
ought to breed anywhere.&amp;quot; Now I believe it was that last remark
that decided me. I accordingly wrote and said I should be
pleased to give the Cockatoos a trial--they have since given me
not one but many !
About a week later a porter toiled up to the vicarage sad
and weary, bearing a cage of Gargantuan Islanders' proportions
covered with sacking, in which were the savages. I got them
inside, undid the sacking, and the Solomons in lavender were
revealed to view.
I may as well here say that they had been known in their
past life as Solomon and Rose. I thought the latter name
unsuitable ; and, with a nice regard for Bible history, we re-
named them Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
Solomon I found was a gentleman of moderate size, about
the same girth as a small Moluccan Cockatoo, but with a very
red and evil looking eye, suggestive of drink ; on his head he
wears a beautiful sulphur-coloured crest, which he can erect at
pleasure or anger ; on his cheeks he has (although it sounds a
bit Irish) a blush of sulphur colour; the rest of his person is
snowy white with a dash of sulphur under the wings ; strong and
wicked looking feet complete the picture, set off by a beak that
would break bars of iron in sunder. When in full dress, I have
no doubt he will be rather a taking gentleman ; but on arrival
he was quite naked in the part where a City Alderman keeps " his
corporation," and his shoulders were so bare that I thought of
making him a coat.
Rose, or the Queen of Sheba as she now is, had a rather
wild and scared look about her, as though, like the immortal
Mrs. Gummidge, she was always on the worrit. She had also a
decidedly undressed appearance about the neck ; in fact she
might have been some ancient duchess on her way to Court: for
she showed a great deal of long and scraggy neck. She too had
had a sulphur crest, but Solomon, apparently not approvin g of
female finery or the order that " ladies going to Court must wear
feathers," had partially removed it. This gave her a wild
unearthly look, and, combined with a bold brown eye, gave her
a very rakish appearance. The rest of her person was clothed
in what should have been dazzling white, but which was, to put
it mildly, a bit " off colour."
I hope I may be excused if I make a slight extract from
their late owner's letter : " Two of our dogs are glad that Rose
and Solomon have departed ; as when the Cockatoos screeched

the bulldog would sit on the stairs and howl enough to take the
roof off, and the toy black-and-tan would whine until tears ran
down her face. It was quite a concert. A few years ago, when they
wanted to nest, we wired off part of a bedroom and put great
logs of wood in, and they enjoyed it tremendously. They picked
the wall paper off in strips, and nibbled holes all round the frame
work of the window ; so we did not put them up there again."
How I cried with laughter as I pictured that scene, described
with such unconscious humour.
I wrote one day to their late owner pathetically bewailing
their destructiveness. His answer was not encouraging. "I am
not surprised at your account of the ruined aviary. When I first
had the Cockatoos I wired off a large bay window in a spare
bedroom, and, as I thought, protected every piece of woodwork
with wire. Unless I had seen it I would never have believed
the destruction done by the pair in a few hours. The window
sashes were nibbled the whole length, and a broad board about
nine inches under that around the ceiling had pieces out as large
as a tea saucer. To this day I cannot imagine how they supported
themselves in doing the mischief." (I can though. They hang
head doivnivaids and go to work.--C.D.F.) The letter continues,
" Their seed was supplied in biscuit tins, and these had their sides
torn out and flattened. They seemed possessed of the 'old gentle-
man,' and did this mischief out of pure cussedness. After all my
time and trouble I was obliged to return them to their cage, for
I believe they would otherwise have wrecked the house ! About
three years ago, when I was taking out the spaniels for a walk,
the birds managed to undo the wire fastening of the cage. Rose
(now the Queen of Sheba.--C. D. F.) went round the room
knocking down ornaments, and Solomon got out at the French
window. At that time the drainage was in progress, and at the
opening opposite this house the cutting was thirty feet deep.
Being the most dangerous part of the road, an old watchman
was posted there. My wife asked if he would catch the bird ;
' All right, mum,' he said, and hobbled after Solomon. Shortly
after he cried out, ' Ive got him, mum'--then there was a brief
scuffle, accompanied by dreadfully sulphureous language ; then
he groaned aloud, and exclaimed, ' By-, lie's got me ! ' He
had, too, in the fleshy part of the palm of the hand, and hung
on like a bulldog ; even when we had managed to get him back
into the cage he was still holding on. The man bled like a pig,
and made the carpet in a nice mess."
However, I felt I was fairly in for it, and as they were

here I should have to make the best of it. It was not long before
I learned to sympathise with that bulldog and toy spaniel.
When enquiring about a new continent, one naturally asks
for its most remarkable product: I can safely say that in this case
it is " the Voice." Those two Cockatoos could give points to
any musician on the vexed question of voice production. When
they are carrying on a quiet orderly conversation, it reminds you
of a captain of an Atlantic liner giving his orders to the crew in
a storm ; but when they get fairly roused up, excited--say over
my appearance or yours--well, they would about wake the dead !
Sometimes, you know, when a friend tells you rather a tall tale,
you say very quietly&apos;, " It's a bit too large for my belief hatch ;
but if you can get it down yours, you are free and welcome
to ship it." Well, I am telling the solemn truth when I say&apos; that
I heard Solomon making some observations to his partner at our
station, which is nearly a mile from the vicarage.
The Solomon Islander is a deeply trying creature, who,
when y r ou are in want of a quiet morning snooze and just as you
have tucked the clothes up to your chin, serenades you until you
feel positively wicked, and get up and throw things at him. What
makes it so aggravating, not to say&apos; maddening, is that the brute
never seems to be where you have thrown the things. You
could swear he was just where you shied that empty soda water
bottle, and instantly conies from the exactly&apos; opposite direction
his " Weigh, weigh, weigh." He is a ventriloquist, and anyone
experienced in Cockatoos soon finds that he is not driven away&apos;
or destroyed by the artillery&apos; of missiles, but merely lies low until
his victim has got into bed again, and then off he starts, as fresh
as paint, with his " Weigh, weigh, weigh," in an ever increasing
crescendo. Whether he is talking to his lady love or whether he
wants me to come and fight him, I do not know, because my
knowledge of Cockatese is limited ; but there are times when I
don't talk to him " with a sweet mouth."
Sometimes people incautiously take liberties with Solomon,
and try to scratch his head. They don't usually try&apos; a second
time! Solomon resents such liberties. A friend tried it once,
and got scratched. He blamed me ! I said people should be
very careful in handling strange Cockatoos ; and the scratched
one profusely agreed with me, and said things I will not repeat,
about " that fool of a bird."
Have y&apos;ou ever seen a very&apos; deaf old lady&apos; trying to hear
what is said to her ? She puts up her ear trumpet and say&apos;s, " Eh,
my&apos; dear, what did y&apos;ou say : the house on fire ? " " No," you

yell; " It's--a--fine--day ! " Well now, that just reminds me of
Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. " Wark ! " he yells.
" Wey," she replies, in a milder way with her head on one side.
"Wark, wark, wark," he yells; " why-don't-you-listen-to-what's-
said-to-you, you-old-idiot; if you are deaf why don't you go to
a doctor?" And poor Sheba subsides--for a time.
I am rather vain of these Cockatoos; and I naturally
desire to show them off, but meet with very little encouragement;
indeed my friends say quaintly but forcibly that, if I do not
get rid of them they shall leave, not the village merely but
the county, and devote their remaining years to sweeping
crossings in their native northern home ; they say they would
rather do this than face those birds again. Besides, they say, it
is very unkind and unnecessary to make a fellow aviculturist
go and say things which would only make things harder for him .
in the time to come.
In a future paper I hope to speak of Solomon and the
Queen of Sheba in domestic life ; but what that future will be I
cannot tell.

By D. Seth-Smith.
In the British Section, the first bird which especially
interested me was a Lesser-Spotted Woodpecker shown by Mr.
Maxwell. One frequently sees the Greater-Spotted species at
Shows, but rarely the Lesser.
It seems absurd to have to show these two species in
separate classes, but so long as the classes are divided according
to the size of the birds, this separation is unavoidable. Again,
when will the authorities understand that the word " variety "
is a most unsuitable and incorrect term to use in connection with
British birds. There are numerous varieties of the one species to
which the fancy Canaries belong, and of other domestic creatures,
varieties which are produced by man's ingenious and careful
selections, but with wild birds the different kinds are each a
distinct species , and varieties of these species are almost
unknown.
Of much interest to lovers of British birds was the
Wryneck shown in beautiful trim by Mr. C. T. Maxwell, and
rightly awarded first prize. A Black Redstart in the same class
was also interesting as being of comparatively rare occurrence

in these islands, and from the fact that, when it condescends to
visit onr shores, it is nearly always in the autumn or winter that
it puts in an appearance. A Crested Tit which is hardly likely
ever to have been wild in these islands was interesting, as was
also a Blue-headed Wagtail, a species which, by the way, is less
rare in this country than is usually supposed.
The Foreign Section commenced with the Whydahs and
Weavers. There were two Red-collared Whvdahs a species which
one sees far more often at Shows now-a-days than formerly. A
rare and pretty bird was the Red-headed Weaver sent by Mrs.
C. Cooper, which was awarded second prize. The first prize was
taken by two Weavers which looked uncommon]}&apos; like two hens
of distinct species, but the present writer is not well enough up
in this family to say to what species the}&apos; belonged.
There were two classes for Waxbills, one for the Common
and the other the rarer kinds ; in the former the first prize was
awarded to a pair of Cordon Bleus. Though very common and
cheap there are few species more beautiful than this; and,
although it is usually considered a delicate species, it is, when
once acclimatised, one of the hardiest of the African Waxbills, and
will stand a considerable amount of cold.
In the class for the rarer Waxbills, a beautiful pair of
Wiener's Waxbills (Pytclia a/raj obtained the first prize, these
being shown by Mr. L. W. Hawkins, who also sent a grand pair
of Rufoustails and a Red-faced finch.
In the class for Gouldians, Parrot Finches and Pintail
Nonpareils, the most interesting birds were the Tricoloured and
Hybrid Parrot Finches. There were also common Parrot
Finches, a beautiful Pintail Nonpareil and some Gouldian
Finches.
The class for Grass Finches and Mannikins, not
included elsewhere, was an interesting one, as it contained
several rare birds. Probably the rarest exhibit was Mr. Hawkins'
pair of Black-rumped Finches (Stictoptcra annulosa), which
were awarded third prize. The same exhibitor sent a charming
pair of Cuba Finches and an equally good pair of White-eared
Grass Finches, which obtained first and second respectively.
The White-eared Grass Finch (Poephila Icucotis) is to the writer's
mind one of the nicest of the Grass Finches, and it is to be
regretted that it is so seldom offered for sale now-a-days. Several
pairs of the closely-allied Masked Finch (P. pcrsonata) were also
shown by Mr. Hawkins, who has lately succeeded in breeding
the species for the first time in this country. There were two
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998449880952381" page_id="10098653"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
pairs of the White-breasted Mannikin (Mania pectoralis) , a
species which has recently become comparatively common,
although formerly very rare.
Two interesting and uncommon exhibits were those of
hybrids between Parson-finch and Bengalese, and Chestnut-finch
and Bengalese, both sent by Mr. Hawkins, but for whom the
foreign Finches at this Show would have been a poor lot indeed.
In the class for all species of Grosbeaks, True Finches and
Buntings, not included elsewhere, the first and second prizes
were awarded to Red-headed and Green Cardinals shown by
Messrs. J. B. Housden and G. G. Henderson respectively, and the
third to a very fine Blue Grosbeak (Guiraca ccerulea) sent by Mrs.
Galloway. The female of this species is very rarely imported,
which is much to be regretted.
Swainson's Sparrows are uncommon in this country and
therefore interesting, and the pair exhibited in this class were
worth notice, as was a Red-lieaded Bunting, a Japanese Hawfinch,
and a pair of European Black-headed Buntings.
In the class for Tanagers there were some lovely birds,
including several specimens of the Blue-and-black, the Blue-
lieaded and the Scarlet.
The Parrakeet class always has special attraction for me,
and on this occasion there were some especially rare and
beautiful specimens exhibited. First of all came Captain
Sutton's beautiful Masked Parrakeet from Fiji, in perfect trim ;
then Mr. Hawkins's very neat and charming little hen Golden-
Shoulder. By the way, all who are interested in the Psephoti
should not fail to see the very beautiful hybrids between this
species and the Many-coloured Parrakeet now in the Parrot-
house at the " Zoo."
The Red-shining Parrakeet ( c) sent by Captain Sutton was
not quite perfect in plumage, but was nevertheless a very
delightful bird and a very fair talker ; I certainly think it should
have been placed third and Mr. Hawkins' Turquoisine fourth,
instead of vice-versa.
There were besides, a good King and Queen, a pair of
Pennants, and single specimens of the Redrump, Crimsonwing,
Plumhead, &amp;c.
In the class for Amazon and Grey Parrots the first prize
was won by an exceptionally fine Grey sent by Mrs. R. Baptie,
but Mr. Woodfield's Yellow-faced Amazon, which came second,
^). Rightly or wrongly, I mule this bird out to be a Tabuau {Pyrrhnlopsis tabuensis). --R-.P&amp;quot;.

was equally fine and considerably rarer. A very good Grey came
third ; and there were several others of the same species as well
as some of the commoner Amazons shown.
Then came the class for Parrots not included above, and
here a Red Macaw shown by Mr. H, B. Smith was awarded first
prize ; tile second being awarded to an exceptionally fine female
Lclectus shown by Captain Sutton. There were also several
Cockatoos, and three Kings which should have been in the
Parrakeet class.
The last class, that devoted to all species not included
elsewhere, was, I think, the most interesting of any, as it contained
several birds of great rarity. Here Mr. T. H. Glasscoe took the
three first prizes with a Regent Bower-bird, a Masked Wood-
swallow, and a Sacred Kingfisher. The first two of these were
absolutely faultless, but the last looked rather sad in its close
quarters, and very different to the smart, bright-eyed, tight-
feathered bird he once was, when he had the run of the present
writer's 36ft. outdoor aviary.
Mr. H. B. Smith exhibited two very fine Starlings, a Red-
headed and a Purple-headed, both in very fine form, as well as a
good Warty-faced Honey-eater.

ByJ. Lewis Bonhote.
In point of entries, as in most other respects, the annual
show at the Crystal Palace this year may be said to be a distinct
improvement on its predecessors; this, in the British Section,
with which I am going to treat, is mainly due to the persevering
efforts of the N. B. B. and M. C., a Society which deserves the
support of all exhibitors of British birds. With the much more
liberal classification, there were far fewer disqualifications owing
to birds being entered in the wrong class ; the judging was also
better, and the elementary mistakes in the knowledge of the
birds, so conspicuous a feature some years ago, are now nearly
eliminated. Taken as a whole, the birds themselves seemed to be
of much better quality, and there were few birds that would not
have been noticed in a local show, if they were not actually in
the money. As regards rarity, we noticed an absence of the
rarer Warblers and delicate birds, such as Willow Wrens, Long-
tailed Tits, Gold-crests, etc., and, as these birds seldom looked
really happy and well, their absence was rather an advantage
than otherwise.

The first class which conies into my province is Class 85,
A.O.V. Hybrid, bred from British birds. I noticed after leaving'
the show that I ought to have made some notes on one or two
specimens in the former class, and am very sorry I did not do so
as there was one bird in particular, viz., Mr. C. J. Ward's Lfinnet-
Bullfinch, which I should much like to have noticed. However,
to return to Class 85, more than half were Greenfinch-Goldfinches
and very handsome birds some of them were. They were all very
much alike ; in some the blaze was brighter, and in others the
size and shape partook of one parent more than the other, but
the markings were very similar in all ; the breast, wings, and tail
most resembled the Goldfinch, and the blaze was well marked in
all ; the back and head, however, showed their Greenfinch
affinities. I would suggest that exhibitors be asked to state,
where possible, in what wa;^ these birds were bred, i.e., whether
from a Goldfinch cock and Greenfinch hen, or vice-versa, as such
notes would add greatly to their interest. The Greenfinch
seems to be an easy bird with which to hybridise, as, in addition
to those mentioned, we noticed several Linnet-Greenfinches in
the class ; and, in these cases, the Linnet affinities were mostly
visible in the beak, sides and back, and the Greenfinch on the
other parts.
1488 was a nice Linnet-Goldfinch, although it was not
noticed ; in size, shape, and colour of the back we recognise the
Linnet parentage ; the remainder resembled a Goldfinch, except
in the absence of a blaze and the markings on the head.
1496 was a cock Blackbird with a cinnamon tendency, and
had no relative among the Thrushes.
1489 (3rd) a Siskin-Redpoll, showed but little of the
Siskin except in size and on the breast.
1502 (2nd) was a Linnet-Twite, a very unusual hybrid
which, except for its shape and the colour of the beak, might
well have passed for a Linnet.
Class 86 (Bullfinch), and 87 (Goldfinch), were both ver}r
large classes, the judging of which must have been no slight
work. All the birds were good, and we could not detect any
foreigners among them. Some of the Goldfinches were spoilt
by being colour-fed, although, we are glad to say, it did not
in this class avail them much. Several "Extra" prizes were
awarded, but not always, we venture to think, judiciously ; there
was, in our opinion, a great difference in the merit of Nos. 1586
and 1599, both taking a second prize.
Class 88 (Chaffinch) was a nice class, but the majority

of the birds seemed to us very dark. No. 1664 (1st) was, however,
a beauty, although rather wild.
Class 89 (Linnet) was another large class with many good
birds, Mr. Prior taking 1st with a splendid specimen, which
was perhaps a little restless, but otherwise perfect. No. 1693
(4th) was a very dark bird, and should not, we think, have been
in the money.
Class 90 (Twite). This, if we mistake not, is a new class,
and the entries quite justified its existence. Mr. Prior again
takes 1st, though the 2nd prize bird ran it close ; they were all
rather wild.
Class 91 (Lesser Redpoll). Formerly it used to be a rule
that preference should be given to cage-moulted birds; and,
although we can find no such rule now, it seems a pity that it
should have been dropped. The 1st prize was in this case
bestowed 011 the only "recently-caught" specimen, presumably
on account of its red breast. The 2nd prize went to a beautiful
Mealy ! which should have been marked wrong class, and we
are thus driven to Mr. Edwards' beautiful Lesser lor the true
champion of the class.
Class 92 (Siskin) a nice clean class, the 1st prize going to
a real beauty. There were many colour-fed monstrosities in this
class, of which more anon.
Class 93 (Brambling), Class 94 (Hawfinch). These classes
were both moderately filled, and contained some splendid birds;
a few of the Bramblings were rather wild, but nevertheless in
good plumage.
Class 95 (Greenfinch). Had we been judging this class
we would have passed over more than half as being colour-fed
monstrosities ; in this species, more than in any other, the
colour is not only intensified but altered by the process of
colour-feeding. The question as to whether the result is an
improvement on nature or not is of necessity a matter of
opinion ; but it seems to us that when one goes to look at a class
of British birds, one expects to see the birds as nature coloured
them, and not as they are made by man's devices. There is to
our mind but a narrow line between " painting" and " colour-
feeding." Why cannot the colour-fed birds be judged in a class
to themselves? they are separated in Canaries, and it is mani-
festly unfair that they should not be so in British birds. No.

went to " impossibilities in nature."

Finch or Bunting), Class 98 (Skylark). Each of these classes
was good of its kind ; the Yellowhammers especially were for
the most part splendid birds. The A. O. V. was chiefly made up
of Reed-buntings, with two exceptions: firstly, a nice Corn-
bunting which won a well deserved 2nd ; and a Mealy Redpoll, a
migratory bird in its wrong class, which was awarded 3rd ! !
Class 99 (A. O. V. Eark or Pipit, Resident or Migratory).
1st was a nice Wood Lark in a rather dark cage. 2nd a good
Meadow Pipit, 3rd a Shore Lark, 5th a Tree Pipit, the remainder
of the class being composed of Meadow Pipits and Wood Larks.
Class 100 (Robins). A very small class, and, except for
those in the money, not of great merit. One could hardly see
the 1st prize bird, for the ornamentation of frost and snow, which
would have been much better omitted.
Class 101 (Blackbird), Class 102 (Thrush), and Class 103
(Starling). Beyond noticing the fact that these classes were well
filled with birds of fine quality, there is nothing to say about
them. The Starlings were perhaps rather below the high quality
usually seen.
Class 104 (Magpie, Jackdaw, Jay, Chough) contained many
splendid Magpies, a few nice Jays, one or two Jackdaws, among
which we noticed 1994, which was not only a good bird but a
good talker ; one good Chough, which took premier honours ;
and one indifferent Chough, which, for some obscure reason, was
awarded V. H. C. The 2nd and 4th went to Magpies, and the
3rd to a Jay.
Class 105 (Pied or Albino). As compared with previous
years this class was but poorly filled, and with the exception of
the remarkable Bullfinch, half-hen half-cock, to which I referred
last year, there was nothing worthy of serious notice. A Pied
Linnet, Pied Sparrow, Cinnamon Blackbird, Pied Greenfinch,
White Blackbird (very inferior compared with Mrs. Herbert's,
which has hitherto for many years topped the class), and a Black
Bullfinch with light-coloured wings, complete the number.
Class 106 (A. O. V. Resident Insectivorous, small). A Corn-
bunting is rightly disqualified, and next we have a beautiful little
Cole Tit. A very nice Lesser Spotted Woodpecker takes 3rd ;
and next to it a nice Yellow Wagtail, in its wrong class, is dis-
qualified. The 1st prize is taken by Mr. Maxwell's Stonechat, a
perfect gem and in beautiful condition. 4th and H. C. are two
nice Nuthatches; and a beautiful Grey Wagtail is second.
Class 107 (A. O. V. Resident Insectivorous, large). This

class begins with three Great Spotted Woodpeckers, very badly
judged. No. 2018 (2nd), was very wild and should have been
V. H. C. No. 2019 (V. H. C.) a nice bird, might very well have
been 4th. No. 2020, the best, should undoubtedly have been 2nd,
but perhaps the Judge was beginning to weary, and no wonder.
H. C. was a moderately nice Ring Ouzel. 1st and 3rd were two
nice Missel Thrushes, the 1st bird being a monster and in such
condition !
Class 10S (Blackcap and Nightingale). The best bird in
this class was 2024 (2nd), a Blackcap. The 1st prize went to a
rather small Nightingale, and the 3rd prize to another Nightin-
gale with the same fault. Three more Blackcaps completed the
class.
Class 109 (A. O. V. Insectivorous, Migratory). Mr. Maxwell
takes 1st, 3rd, and 4th, and H. C. in this class with Wryneck,
Black Redstart, Yellow Wagtail, and Blue-headed Wagtail
respectively, the Black Redstart being a most splendid bird,
although they were all good and splendidly kept. The only
other species were a Redwing and a Crested Tit, the latter
rightly disqualified.
Class no (A. O. V. Seed-eating, Migratory). The 3rd prize
was given to a Tree Sparrow, which ought to have been wrong
classed ; an Ortolan takes 2nd ; a Lapland Bunting, a beautiful
specimen but wild, 4th ; and a nice Snow Bunting takes the
honours.

A short account of my experience in breeding these
pretty little birds may be of interest to some of the members of
the Society.
Two years ago I purchased some Gouldians of both
varieties, Blackheads and Redheads, and now have about twenty-
five including four young birds.
I keep them in a room 14ft. long by 8ft. wide by 11ft.
high, in the centre of which I have erected a small sycamore
tree; and at the end facing the light I have hung some cocoa-
nut husks and a breeding cage ; and an ordinary dome cage
stands on a table.
Many times my hopes of breeding these birds have been
raised by the making of nests and the laj'ing of eggs, and
sitting by the various pairs of birds; but when the Autumn

of last year was well in, and I had given up any idea of the
Gouldians nesting in earnest, they set to work, and on the 25th
October, I had the good fortune to hear the chirp of young
voices in a nest made in the breeding cage, the doors of which
I had fastened open.
Although I was very curious to know how many young
birds there were in the nest, I curbed my curiosity till 17th
November, when, on going to look into the nest, three young
Gouldians flew out fully fledged, leaving two unfertile eggs in
the nest.
They were a sort of a dull grey without anything to
indicate sex or colour of the head, but they had purple spots
round the edge of the mouth, and the under part was a lighter
colour than elsewhere. Their mother was a Blackhead and
their father was a Redhead, both excellent parents, devoting all
their time to the feeding of their offspring, who got stronger and
more noisy day by day.
All three youngsters got on well with the exception of
one little chap who died on 16th December of fits, which seemed
to develop suddenly, but from what cause I do not know. O11
27th November, another nest attracted my attention ; this time
it was in a cocoa-nut husk, and, after leaving it undisturbed for
about eighteen days, I found two young birds in it half fledged ;
but the parents in this case were not so good at feeding their
progeny, and so the latter did not make nearly so much noise
at feeding time, and were in fact, more backward than the first
hatching.
The diet I provided for the new comers was hard boiled
egg, bread and milk, Abrahams' food, and canary seed and spray
millet.
There is also always plenty of sea sand, red sand, crushed
oyster shell, mortar from old bricks, chalk straight from the pits,
and cuttle shell, and also lump sugar kept damp with water so
as to be more easily broken up by the birds.
By the kind advice of Mr. Wiener, I caused the gas jet in
the bird room (but outside the wire partition) to be lighted at
dusk when the short winter days set in ; and, by erecting a sort
of reflector of tin so as to throw the light on the feeding shelf,
I was glad to find the birds often feeding up to 8 or 9 o'clock at
night, at which time the light was turned down ; and on foggy
mornings the gas is turned on again, and sometimes, alas for
Dondon cage birds, kept on the whole day, to enable them to see
to feed.

The temperature I keep up to between 50 and 60 degrees
Fahr. by means of an oil lamp stove, which is easily turned on
and off; and, however cold it is outside, I always open the
windows for a few minutes in the mornings to change the air.
The losses by egg-binding of numbers of hen birds is
distressing, but I have saved a great many lives by administering
weak whiskey and water, and putting the sufferer in a small
cage in front of the fire, which treatment generally results in the
production of a soft egg; and the bird after a few hours is able to
fly about in the bird room again.
The preponderance of males is also a detriment in the
bird room, and therefore I have removed half-a-dozen gentlemen
to another cage, and am in hopes of again rearing some young
birds.
I am also indebted to Mr. Wiener for some of the Setaria
glauca, which the birds devour with avidity, and which I keep as
a bo?ine bouche for them on rare occasions until I can obtain a
supply, which I should be glad to do from any source.
REVIEW.
" My Birds in freedom and captivity,&amp;quot; by the Rev. Hubert D.
Astley. -- J. M. Dent &amp; Co., Aldine Ho 7 ise, 29 &amp; 30, Bedford
Street, W. C.
We have been favoured with a copy of this charming book,
sumptuously got up. It's author, who is, fortunately for him-
self and his readers, also its illustrator, is a Member of the
Council of the Avicultural Society.
The title is a correct one, for Mr. Astley, who evidently
loves birds for their interesting characteristics and not merely
for their rarity, writes sketchily of many tribes both British and
foreign--alike in freedom and captivity--which he has watched,
or studied, or kept in garden or aviary. It is impossible to give
any list of all the birds which in his fifteen chapters he describes.
Among them Hoopoes, Blue Thrushes, Rock Thrushes, Night-
ingales, the Indian Shama, the Dliyal bird, and Virginian Night-
ingales have a place ; his account of a pair of the latter, which
escaped from his aviary and nested in freedom in the garden is
most interesting, probably a unique experience in England.
Ring Ousels too, Water Ousels, Wrens and Titmice, Sea and Shore
birds, Parrots and Parrakeets are among the miscellaneous species
sketched lightly with pen and pencil. Some of the illustrations,
reproduced in photogravure, are extraordinarily life-like, far

more so than the generality of bird-portraits taken now-a-days
by professional artists. They remind us of some of the best
of Barraband's pictures in Eevaillant's Oiseaux cT Ajrique. The
Pied Wagtail, the Ring Ousel, Oyster Catchers and the Red-
start strike us as being among the happiest pictures. The author
is at times somewhat digressive, but the digressions are always
apposite, and such as a scholar and travelled man ot the world
uses as illustration to his subject, and through them interests in
the pursuit of his heart classes which would fail to be attracted
by chapters on systematic ornithology. Beyond the graphic
portraiture of this wide range of feathered genera there is a
chapter on the comforts in cage and aviary, which aviculturists
may justly be expected to provide for the creatures which they
confine for their pleasure ; and a somewhat sad chapter on the
cruelties which among some nations are daily&apos; practiced on birds
from absolute callousness; and in our own land, we hope and
think, rather from ignorance of the wants of birds, than from
indifference to their sufferings.
We heartily commend the book to all bird-lovers and
aviculturists, and are sanguine that it will bring recruits to our
ranks. We may add that there is an edition de hixe of this work,
a copy of which has been graciously accepted from the author
by Her Majesty Queen Alexandra.
NOTE.
It is found that no articles are more popular than those in
which the Aviaries of Members are described. It has been sug-
gested that the reproduction of Photographs of such Aviaries
would be an additional attraction, and I shall be grateful to
Members who will send me both descriptions and pictures of
their aviaries. O. E. CreSSWELL, Editor.

Sir,--I have two young Amherst's Pheasants, five-and-a-half months
old, and they are exactly like their mother. Can the sexes be distinguished
at that age, and how ? And when do cocks come into adult plumage ? also
to what age do aviary Pheasants attain ?
Also please let me know how to tell the sex of Woodlarks, and what
to feed them on. Are they satisfactory birds in captivity, and do they sing
best in a cage or aviary ? Gavin Alston.

The following replies were sent to Mr. Alston.
Re Amherst's Pheasants--At five-and-a-lialf months the sexes of young
Amherst's Pheasants should be distinguishable. The upper long tail feathers
become pencilled with white, while the young hens remain the same colour
as their mothers. The next change is the appearance of black about the
heads of the young. Unless yours are very backward birds they must be
hens. Cocks come into full plumage when about sixteen months old.
O. E. Cressweee*
Re Woodlarks--The sexes are practically alike, but the female is
slightly smaller and has slightly less crest. They should be fed chiefly on
.soft food and hard-boiled egg, ants' eggs, and a little scraped meat and
mealworms. You might try them with a little seed as well, but I do not
think they will take much. They are nice birds in a cage, and sing very
sweetly and softly, but are rather delicate and will not stand our winters
out of doors. In an aviary they are quite harmless to other inmates, but
being quiet and dull-coloured are not much seen. J. L. Bonhote.

Sir,--I should be pleased to receive a little information on the
following.
A friend, who is leaving N. Orleans for England in a few weeks, has
written asking me if I would like a couple of pairs of American Goldfinches
(I think I have read they are Siskins); a pair of Baltimore Orioles ; and a
pair of Orchard Orioles. I have never had these birds, but have read of
them ; are they of any value? I never remember seeing the Goldfinch for
sale; are they rare? ( d ) Also has the Cat-bird been imported, and is there
any sale for them? They are certainly not common in N. York State or
Pennsylvania from what I have seen.
I have just received a bird from the Azores, about the size of a
Mountain Linnet but the shape of a Norwich Canary; wings and back
vellowish-green striped with dark grey, under parts light greenish-yellow,
cheeks grey. Will it be a Wild Canary ? It is a very good singer: Canary
notes but much sweeter. H. C. HESEETON.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Heselton.
All the birds you mention would be worth having. Win&apos; it is I do
not know, but these N. American birds seem to be so rarely imported that
I have never seen any, excepting the Baltimore Hang-nest, in a bird-shop :
they do come occasionally.
Dr. Russ speaks of the American Cat-bird as a favourite cage-bird:
he says that it is a good mimic, and is admired and interesting on account
of its cat-calls and other amusing notes.
I am afraid I do not recognise the bird from the Azores ; and, being
at home just now, have no opportunity of looking it up. My advice is--
By all means have the American birds. A. G. Buteer.

Sir, --On passing a bird-shop in Glasgow, a short time ago, a bird in
the window drew my attention. It was about the size of a Linnet, and
resembled a Siskin in colour and marking, but neither of them was so
decided as in that bird. The cap was not so black, the colour of the body
was more smoky, and a distinct fawn-coloured bar crossed the wing. I
entered the shop with the intention of purchasing it, but was informed by
the dealer that it was not for sale. He explained that it had been deposited
by a young man who had brought two of them from Cuba, but the other
one had died. He said they were Cuba Linnets.
I neglected to ask if he considered it a cock or if it had any song.
It was very tame, and although not very bright in colouring still a desirable
bird.
As I had not seen a similar bird before, can auv of our members give
any information about it ? also say if this is its proper name.
Gavin Alston.
CUBAN LINNET.-- (Reply to Mr. Alston).
If the bird resembles our Siskin it should belong to the genus
Chrysomitris which certainly is prevalent in the New World ; but I cannot
discover that ail)&apos; of the species is known to inhabit Cuba ; nor can I find
any Siskin with a fawn-coloured band on the wing : indeed I am unable to
discover any American finch which fits your description. A coloured
sketch of the bird might help me to name it for you. Could it be Spizu
atnericana ? (e). A. G. BUTLER.
EAGLE OWLS.
Sir, -- I have had now two Eagle Owls for five years in a large aviary.
They have never shown any signs of wishing to nest, and it is impossible to
tell one from the other, so I think they must be of the same sex.
I shall be glad if you can tell me if there is any way of distinguishing
the sexes other than by the size, and how long they usually are before
breeding. Henry Boughton Leigh.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Leigh :
I know of no way by which to distinguish the sexes of Eagle Owls
except by size, the female being much the larger.
A pair in my possession were taken from the nest in 1896, and made
no attempt at breeding until last year, when eggs were laid, but they were
unfertile. They are at present busy preparing to nest, and I am hoping for
eggs in a short time.
When nesting they become&apos;very pugnacious, and attack anyone enter-
ing their aviary. The signs of nesting are a great deal of hooting at night,
and scrapes made in various parts of their aviary. J. L. Bonhote.

By the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton.
The subject of the accompanying plate had not much to
recommend it as a cage bird, except its rarity. It came into my
possession almost accidentally.
It is always my custom, when anyone comes from a
parrot country to preach for Foreign Missions, to ask them about
the parrots of their country. Two or three years ago, in 1897, it
happened that Mr. Berkeley, from Barbados, came to preach. I
asked him about Guilding's Amazon, which is peculiar to
St. Vincent. He told me that if I wrote to Canon Branch, who
is a naturalist, he might get me one.
The result of my correspondence was that one was got, by
a shot, I think, which brought it down without maiming it. But
just as Canon Branch was looking out a ship by which to send it,
the bird escaped, and soon after, Canon Branch left St. Vincent
for Dominica, and my chance of getting a Guilding's seemed to
be gone. I say " seemed " because, as a matter of fact, Dad}&apos;
Thompson, whose very interesting letters to her father, Mr.
Bosworth Smith, of Harrow, on the hurricane at St. Vincent,
were published in the " Times," offered me one later. But I
pointed ont to Canon Branch that if he could no longer get me
Chrysotis guildingii, yet there was a still rarer bird peculiar to
Dominica, Chrysotis auqusia, and I should be glad to buy a
specimen, if one was for sale.
I confess I expected to hear no more, and so was agreeably
surprised one day at receiving a letter from him to say his son
had shot an augusta without injuring it, and he would sell it to
me if I would like to have it. I struck the bargain, and then Canon
Branch asked me if I would also take a smaller parrot they had.
I knew bouqueti was also peculiar to Dominica, and asked for the
description of the bird, and as the description seemed to be that
of bouqueti , I agreed to take that too.

In June, last year, I had a telegram from Plymouth to say
the steamer with two parrots for me would be at Southampton
that night. I packed up, and started at once, but was rather
dismayed, on boarding the ship, at the huge size of the cage.
However, there was augustci, and there, no less certainly,
bouqueti: though boziqzieti did not look very cheerful. However,
by the aid of two men, the cage was safely landed, and taken to
the S. W. Hotel. There it had to stay in the hall all night, for
the ship had berthed too late for me to catch the last train home.
Early next morning I left, having ordered a special cart to meet
my cage at Cirencester, and got home without mishap.
It seemed rather a formidable task to get them out of their
cage. Augusta is the biggest of all Amazons, and, if it were
vicious, it would not be a very easy task to abstract it. The cage
was too big to get into the house; however, I had the door
broken off in the coach house, and then made a dash for their
legs. They did not seem to be vicious, and, with a few squalls
and a little fluttering, were soon safe in the cage in which they
were to live.
Augusta was in fine plumage, and never gave me a
moment's anxiety. But I cannot say the same for bouqueti. It
never sat in a right attitude, and always seemed dull. Although
it was June, I kept a fire going all day in the small room in
which they were ; but I confess I left in July for my " kur " at
Tarasp, with some misgiving. But I had good accounts of the
bird, and when I returned home it seemed fairly well. Eater, in
the autumn, it again looked out of sgrts, and rapidly became so
ill that it could no longer sit on the perch and would not eat. I
gave up all hope of its recovery ; but by one of those chances
which happen once in a thousand times, the bird did not die,
and after one or two relapses got well enough for me to sell it to
the Zoological Gardens. In fact it got better than it had ever
been.
The bird struck me as being the Dominican variety of the
Blue-fronted. It was of the same size ; had the same shape,
carriage, and tail ; while the colouring does not differ more than
might be easily accounted for by its complete isolation for
centuries. My bird was tame enough to let me scratch its head,
but beyond that had nothing to recommend it. It was not
affectionate, it never said a word, and uttered ceaselessly a cry,
which, although unlike that of any other Amazon, was not the
less wearisome on that account. I parted with it without a
shadow of regret, and felt its proper place was the Zoo, where it

seems mucli happier than it was with me. It is the only Amazon
that I have seen that wanted extra warmth, and I fancy the heat
of the Zoo parrot house, which ordinarily I consider too great,
just suits it. The authorities there were very glad to acquire it,
as it was the first they have had. They have had versicolor from
S. Lucia, and have one now which 7 as certainly ought to have,
as they boiiqueti, for the poor thing has evidently been a great
pet and misses the petting. Their possessing the two enables
the public to compare them.
I am now hoping that Sir Harry Thompson may be able
to get me a versicolor.
OWLS.
By E. G. B. Mkade-Waldo.
Ever since I kept birds, which is since I was a small child,
the Owl family have held the first place in my affections; both
as inmates of our aviaries and living in wild and semi-wild
conditions about our grounds and woods.
Owls stand confinement well, living for great numbers of
years in perfect health. Many species breed well; they maintain
themselves in perfect plumage, become very tame, shew them-
selves well, and, beyond good habitations suited to their mode of
life, good and fresh food administered in proper quantities
according to the time of year, water for bathing, and of course
cleanliness, they do not require much attention. Almost all
species appear to be practically indifferent to cold. Aviaries
intended for Owls should be roomy and of two compartments,
an open and an inner, with solid roof, sides and back; but the
entrance into the back compartment may be wide so that birds
roosting in it are not out of sight. All Owls love a sun bath, and
the site chosen for their aviaries should, if possible, be one that
has the morning sun, for half the pleasure in keeping these
birds will be lost if you cannot see them enjoying themselves
in their own way. And no more curious sight can present itself
to the lover of birds than a Great Lapp or Ural Owl laying
spread out in the sun bath, its face turned full on the orb itself,
the pupils of its eyes vanished to the size of a pin's head. I
have seen our own Tawny Owl bask in this manner in its wild
state.
All Owls are great bathers and should be supplied with
roomy baths, from which, of course, they also drink. This

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997626590909091" page_id="10098669"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
necessity is, I fancy, often omitted by those who wish to keep
Owls. On emerging from their bath some of the large and very
downy-plumaged Owls present the most ludicrous appearance.
All the Owls like large and rough perches. I use larch or
small Scotch fir poles for mine, but some of the small Owls, such
as the Scops, should be supplied with thin perches as well. It is,
of course, not advisable to place more than one species of Owl
in an aviary, and a breeding pair must always have an aviary to
itself.
To keep these birds in perfect health and order good and
fresh food must be given. For convenience I generally use
rabbits, but they also eat birds, chickens' heads and necks ; and,
when procurable, fur or feathers must always go with each meal;
and the health of the individual cau always be gauged by the
condition of its castings, viz., the indigestible portion of its last
meal which is ejected the following day. The healthy castings
should consist of the fur or feathers and bones alone tightly
wrapped. If sloppy, or with portions of undigested meat, the bird
is not well, The lining of the gizzard and the skin of , the feet of
a bird eaten are ejected as indigestible by an Owl when in health,
and need not alarm its owner. Owls do not eat the intestines of
their prey, and for cleanliness sake it is well to paunch all rabbits
etc., that are supplied as food. All Owls eat a great deal more food
during the summer and early autumn months than during the
rest of the year, and from May to September should have as
much as they can eat once a day, but not more. The reason for
this feeding is obvious. During the summer and autumn, food
is easily obtained, owing to numerous young and inexperienced
creatures always being on the move ; but when the strain of
moulting is over and the supply of fat laid on (all Owls are very
fat in winter) much less food is required ; and Owls, during the
winter and early spring, must often starve for a long time ; and
most of the larger Owls are none the worse for one day's fast in
the week from October to April.
In feeding Owls it may be taken as a rule that the large
Owls eat much less food in proportion to their size than small
ones. The Scops Owls, who will only exist on exceedingly
digestible food and insects, are enormous eaters, and generally
require feeding twice a day. The Tittle Owl (.Athene noctua ) is
also an enormous eater, but not in any way a delicate bird. It
has been established as a wild species in my neighbourhood for
years, and is quite common, and I have seen individuals sitting
perched on the telegraph wires when going by train in the
middle of a hot midsummer day.

This sketch of Owl keeping is only intended as a hint to
their management, and not in any way individual. It may be
taken as a general rule that Owls of the genus Bubo, as the Eagle
Owl is, are very hardy and thrive well, and that the Arctic Owls
are delicate and require care, notably Tengmalm's, the Hawk Owl,
the Snowy Owl, and of this latter I can endorse all that Mr.
St. Quintin says of the importance of tender food for them.
Rabbits always as young as possible, young rats (never old ones),
water rats (the latter are particularly good food, and possibly
from being vegetarians are very like the Lemmings) with, if
they will eat them, young birds, mice, sparrows, fish, fresh
chickens' heads and necks forming the best diet. All food should
be given warm, viz., just dead, as often as possble to all the Owl
tribe, and has a most beneficial effect.
In describing the aviaries that I consider suitable I forgot
to mention that, as many Owls prefer to nest on the ground, it is
advisable to have the floor of the back compartment consisting
of the ground itself, which is the only thing in which a convenient
hole can be scratched. For those that nest in boxes a little
decayed wood is all that is necessary, no Owl using any materials
for its nest.
At some future time I will give an account of some
particular Owls and their nesting habits.
INTELLIGENT PETS.
By Rosie Aederson.
I suppose all bird-lovers have at different times had one
special pet which had a nearer place in their affections than any
of the others, and this not because of the bird's rarity or beauty,
but because it was intelligent and returned the care and love
spent upon it by its owner.
One of my earliest recollections was that of "Joe," a very
fine Grey parrot. Most people know that a Grey which shows
more or less red on the body or wing-feathers, is called by the
dealers a " king" bird, and is considered of higher value than an
ordinary Grey. Every year as " Joe " moulted his little regal badge
always reappeared. He lived with us many years, notwithstanding
the fadt that his diet was most unsuitable, being chiefly sopped
bread and hemp seed. I have never known a bird speak so plainly,
or learn fresh words so quickly, and he would not only pronounce
the words, but even imitate exactly the tones of the speaker's
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.995492976190476" page_id="10098671"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
voice. The longest of liis many sentences was, " The Queen,
Prince Albert, and all the Royal Family, hip ! hip ! hurrah!
"Joe" had a keen sense of humour, and would whistle for the
dog, and then if the animal obediently answered his call, would
command him in scathing tones to "get out." At times "Joe"
would put on a pathetic air, and bid "Anne, fetch the doctor,
poor Joe's very poorly." He was a born actor, and could dance very
prettily, lifting his feet most daintily, and whistling softly mean-
while. Then too, when told to 'put his coat on,' he would
imitate in a most amusing fashion the struggles of a man getting
into a great coat. He would make any number of courtly bows
when bidden, and like the celebrated " Grip," could uncork and
decanter innumerable bottles of imaginary wine.
Another of my special favourites was " Ben," a tufted
duck. In his summer suit of white and glossy purple-black he
looked very fine, with his quaint little "duck tails" depending
from the back of his head, which he used to shake in the most
old fashioned manner.
His wife "Susan," and a little Teal named " Oliver," were
his most devoted slaves. The trio spent most of the day basking
under some bushes near the house, but in the evening they
regularly journeyed down to a small artificial stream, some
way down the garden. " Ben " always led the van, and called
for frequent halts, squatting on the grass, whilst the other two
would patiently wait beside him until he was ready to proceed,
never dreaming of going on alone.
" Ben " had a great weakness for freshly dug up worms,
and I had only to come into the garden with a small fork or
trowel in my hand to fill him with the greatest excitement. He
would follow me all over, and when overcome by his importunity,
I tried to find some of the coveted dainties, he would stand close
to me with his eyes fixed on the hole I was digging, and if the
worms did not appear fast enough--as sometimes happened in
hot weather--he would tug at my dress with his bill, and then
run away frightened for the moment at his own boldness, only to
return presently with renewed courage. "Ben" would feed
from our hands, but much preferred to wash his worms before
eating them, and would solemnly lead the way, with a worm
dangling in his bill, to a bowl ot water (that always stood in the
* Probably "Joe" learnt this sentence previous to Prince Albert's death in 1861.
This being so the parrot must have been at least 23 years old when he died, which was
about 1883, but I only remember him for the latter part of his life.--R. A.

garden) looking back at me, and telling me as plainly as possible
to bring the remaining worms, and look cpiick about it.
It is now some years ago since I went to my first bird
show. It was held at the Royal Aquarium, and who can describe
the delights, to the novice in bird keeping, of a first show. Here
I saw for the first time in my life a pair of Cordon Bleus. There
seemed only one pair exhibited, from which fact, in our ignorance,
we concluded they were very rare as well as lovely, and it ended
in our buying them for a very high figure.
Next day we were disillusioned.
In a dealer's shop were some of these very birds, at a few
shillings a pair, and in talking of the show to the shopman he
remarked, ' he had heard of a party there, who had given over
#2 os. od. for a pair of Cordons.' It was the last straw to our
discomfiture.
All the same these little birds gave us much pleasure. I
think they would have bred in an aviary, for the lieu laid several
eggs in the large cage which they tenanted together with
numerous small Waxbills.
Poor " Phyllis" died after a time, and Corydon," who had
never shown her much affection, became devoted to a second
wife; she also died, and a third hen was provided. At first the
newcomer was terribly persecuted by the cock, but she was a
very wise little bird, and evidently took for her own the motto
of Prosper le Gai, " I bide my time," and in the end succeeded
in entirely winning the affection of her lord and master.
The Cordons' cage stood in a large bay window, and as
" Corydou" grew old it was found too cold for him, so he was
placed in a separate cage by the fire, but at night he cried so
plaintively, that we put him back, when the birds were moved for
the night into a warmer room. The little fellow knew quite well
it was for his good, and would hop quite readilj^ of his own accord
into his private cage, and as readily return to the hen at roosting
time, always letting us know when he considered it was the
proper hour by chirping loudly.
All these pets are dead and gone, but one which is a great
favourite is still living. I have had my little Senegal Parrot for
nearly a year.
He had already been four years in England when I bought
him, and was sold to me under a wrong name, the modest price
asked being only 7/-. His colouring is very pretty. He has a
grey head, bright orange yellow breast, and the rest of his body

chiefly grass green. At first he was so nervous that it was painful
to come near him, for if I only spoke he trembled all over. Now
he demands the first attention of any bird in the aviary, and is
inclined to be jealous of a beautiful Masked Parrakeet, " Dick
Turpin," which is very tame and somewhat of a rival.
My Senegal loves to be let out of his cage, but is terribly
destructive to the woodwork, and is fast pulling the aviary to
pieces. He quite despises the special log put for his delectation,
and if I reprove him looks up for a moment as if to say, " don't
interrupt, I'm very busy," and continues to strew the floor most
industriously with splinters. He is a very gentle and affectionate
bird, and has quaint little ways of his own. While on my arm he
will rarely eat with his face towards me, always turning his back,
and then reversing himself when lie has finished his dainty.
Having only just learnt to come on my hand he is rather nervous
over it, and evidently decides in his own mind that if he can't see
me, why then, of course, I can't see him.
Though perfectly well now, a short time ago I feared my
Senegal was going to die. He slept nearly all day, and seemed
very ill. On the kind advice of two of our members I varied his
seed diet, and put two or three drops of Tabasco Sauce daily in
his water. Also, as he seemed very lonely, and I could not find
him a hen, I fastened a looking-glass in his cage--with great
success. He was very delighted with it, and possibly agrees
better with his own reflection than he might do with a living
companion.
All my parrots prefer a make of biscuit called " Nice " to
any other, and both the Senegal and the Masked Parrakeet
delight in peanuts. The latter is also very fond of mealworms
and spray millet. In conclusion, I may just mention that I have
found Tabasco Sauce a splendid remedy for chill and inflam-
mation in the cases of a Diuca Finch and an Avadavat, both of
which seemed at death's door.

We have had our Cockatiel for some years, but he was not
until lately a very special favourite, for though tame and
fearless, he has not been affectionate. If a finger were put
between the bars of his cage, even though accompanied by
endearing epithets, he would instantly attack it, drawing blood
with his sharp little beak. When let out he would fly on to the

breakfast table, stalk about as if all belonged to him, eat a little
salt, nibble a hole in the loaf and toss a spoon or two on the
ground then fly on to my shoulder, but every time I moved my
head he would give my ear a horrible tweak. All his real
affection was centred in a Grey parrot, their cages had always
to be side by side ; were Polly carried out of the room, Joey's
cage must quickly follow or he rent the air with ear piercing
screams, and however far off Polly might be, she heard and
answered back ; but yet Polly did not fully return his love for if
Joey alighted on her cage she would at once try to bite him,
and we could never let the two out together. But ye: Polly
would sit with her wings opened out like Joey's, and would imitate
his wee voice so exactly one could not tell which was speaking.
"Joey, Joey, Joey, pretty Joey, pretty dear, kiss pretty dear, pity
poor Joey, let poor Joey out, kiss kiss kiss," first one and then
the other would say, and then try to whistle a tune, Polly
copying all Joey's blunders.
But one day our dear Polly died--sadly mourned by us all.
Joey sat by her till the last, bat he seemed to understand it all,
for when she was carried away dead he never called after her
but sat silent and moping for a day or two. We put him beside
the Budgerigars, but he thought them too small to be interesting
and instead cast loving eyes on the Fox terrier. If Tinker were
lying in the arm chair, Joey would sit on the arm of it, posturing
and talking and kissing, and when the dog jumped down Joey
would follow and keep running to and fro under his nose. It
amused Tinker and he would sometimes wish to have a rough
game, in which we feared he might unintentionally hurt poor
Joey ; and when the bird would try sometimes to alight on his
back he would get a little nervous and cross, and so at last Joey
has been constrained to turn to his human friends. He now
sits on my shoulder without punishing my ear so cruelly; and on
cold evenings when we draw round the fire he likes to nestle in
my lap, wrapped round in a warmed duster, with a fold of my
dress drawn over him. If I peep at him I often find his
eyes closed and his head lying sideways as if on a pillow;
now and then he pops his head out and looks around and
then draws it back like a tortoise into its shell. He will also
at these times let me scratch his head and coax him without
attempting to bite. I rather fear that love of warmth may be a
sign of old age, and now we have grown fond of each other I
shall grieve when the time comes to part with him.

ACCIDENTS.--In reply to Miss Alderson's inquiry
(p. 82), I think it essential that support of some kind should be
used in the case of a broken leg. The point to be aimed at is
that, after the two ends of the broken bone have been placed in
position, they should be so fixed that there may not be any
movement to hinder the knitting of the two pieces. The actual
kind of splint or support used must depend on the position of
the fracture and the size of the bird, for it must not be too heavy
for the patient to bear. In the case of the Cuckoo I spoke of
(p. 56), the fracture being actually at the joint, nothing was used
or seemed possible but a simple linen figure-of-8 bandage, which
I had been taught in olden days at the St. John Ambulance
Classes. I think I give good advice (alas ! I do not always follow
even myown advice) when I add that it is, as a rule, a wise proceed-
ing to call in a doctor or vet., the former from preference, if one can
be obtained who will trouble himself about a bird, as some of
the latter are very heavy handed. Not only are two pairs of
hands necessary, but professional men have materials and
appliances (not to mention professional knowledge) which are
often of great value, and which an amateur would not possess.
THE SHAMA.--I am very glad that Phil, is so well
(p. 82). The Shama, in my opinion, is a charming species.
ROCK SALT.--I can fully endorse Mr. St. Quintin's
appreciation (p. 82) of the vaiue of rock salt. I keep it in all
my aviaries and cages, and have done so for many years. Mr.
Savage had something to say on this subject, likewise in
connection with Gouldian Finches, at page 17 of Vol. III., where
also I have a foot-note. As Mr. St. Quintin infers, in dry places
it requires wetting pretty frequently. Pieces in cages I regularly
dip or even wash.
EGG SHELLS AND EGG-EATING.--Another capital
thing is a supply of egg shells, from fresh eggs only. These
should be baked, and then ground in a coffee mill, or else
crumbled very small. This will not induce to egg-eating, as
some have supposed. Small aviary birds very rarely, probably
never, eat their own eggs for the sake of eating them : they are
not such fools as all that. They eat their eggs simply because
they consider their surroundings unsuitable for breeding. A
regular egg-eater, if moved to a proper place, will breed at once.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.998241404761905" page_id="10098676"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
A supply of egg shells has just the opposite effect, for it supplies
a want which is sometimes keenly felt, and thus not only tends
to prevent egg-eating but likewise egg-stealing. Nevertheless
remember that tons of egg shells will not force a dissatisfied
couple to breed successfully.
SOFT EGGS.--It seems to me that some of the treat-
ments suggested for anything of the nature of egg-binding are
altogether too drastic. One feels that a bird could not be very
far gone if it could go through what is sometimes recommended--
and live. So long as certain of the more delicate antipodeans
are permitted to nest in cages or small aviaries, or to over-lay,
during our winter months more especially, soft eggs will
occasionally occur, no matter what care may be taken. But if
it be a first case, and cold lias not been caught, extra warmth
and a quiet retreat are usually all that are necessary. Neverthe-
less, where plenty of space cannot be provided, segregation of
the sexes is the only safe course.
The treatment by Mr. W. C. Douglas (p. 105) of his birds is
practically what I have followed for years. I use brandy (sparingly)
instead of whiskey, and add fluid magnesia (an invaluable bird-
medicine) freely, place in a box-cage with a little short-cut hay in
one corner and plenty of perfectly dry sand, &amp;c., and a low perch,
and cover well over with green baize excepting a small part
opposite the food and drink. The food should be of the simplest,
and should include a little plain biscuit crumbled small. I
place the cage in a quiet spot near the stove, and, if it be merely
a soft egg, the bird will be all right in the morning. As a
precautionary measure, I keep it in the box-cage for a few hours
before returning it to its old quarters. Should inflammation of
the ovary have been set up by cold or other cause, the case is
very serious. If warmth and quiet, assisted by some such
medicine as the above, will not cure the patient, nothing will.
Strong measures cannot but do harm ; for it must be remembered
that tiny foreign finches should not be judged, as they too often
are, by the Canary standard ; and even the latter would be all
the better if gentler measures were used. As the bird is about
to be placed in the cage, a little of the above mixture should be
given with a paint brush. In very bad cases, and also when the
patient loses heart and settles down to die, the physicking must
be continued from time to time, but with the greatest care and
gentleness. A drop of sweet oil deposited on the vent will
sometimes render valuable aid; but warmth is the great thing--

<bodyText confidence="0.995413695652174" page_id="10098677"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
even to the extent, should it become necessary, of placing the
bird in a tiny cage over the kitchen range.
GREEN FOOD.--In the aviary, all the year but especially
during the winter mouths, when grass, &amp;c., cannot be relied on
to grow freely, I regularly sow wheat as well as grass ; and it is
greatly appreciated by birds of many species. I refer, of course,
to the young growing corn ; and equally of course it must be
sown very thickly. I find no difficulty (if I can find the time)
in keeping up a plentiful supply of green food growing in the
aviary all the year round. Here, in London, at no season of the
year can the special plants and weeds so often recommended be
obtained, but with wheat, oats, grass, peas, &amp;c., and sometimes
rape, I find it possible to do very well without them. The
Virginia Creeper shoots, too, are largely eaten by some species.
In addition to the foregoing, during the autumn and winter, cut-
up grapes for the Orioles, Bulbuls, &amp;c., are within the reach of
the whole avine community. In the closed cages (winter only),
I supply cooked cabbage, or greens of some kind, in little glass
dishes (never metal), of which a considerable quantity is regularly
consumed by some of the birds, apparently to their no small
benefit. Raw green food will sometimes kill birds unaccustomed
to it; but I have never known anything but good result from
green food that has been cooked.

LIGHTS AT NIGHT.--I do not say that lights in winter

<bodyText confidence="0.998977611111111" page_id="10098677"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
are in all cases absolutely necessary, but I consider them to be
desirable, and in some cases quite necessary. It is a common
saying that more birds die during the autumn and spring than
in the winter. The moult, directly or indirectly, accounts for
the autumnal mortality, but how about the (p. 88) spring!
Privation does not necessarily kill outright, but it so weakens
the constitution that, although the poor victim may struggle on
for a while, it nevertheless sinks to so low an ebb that a
very little trial, something less than the night frosts of spring,
will too often cause it to pass away, sometimes without any very
apparent cause. Consider how near to death's door Mr. Wiener's
birds (p. 18) must have been when just a trifling delay in their
breakfast caused their death ! I must give one solemn warning
however; it is not sufficient to shine a light on the food dishes ;
the light must be sufficient to enable the birds to find their ways
back to the sleeping-boxes.
While considering this question, it must be borne in mind
that birds unaccustomed to artificial light do not understand it

at first; but if it be persevered in and arranged judiciously they
will come out in troops during the very long nights. The
unanimity with which the majority give up the night feeding as
the nights shorten is worthy of notice, for it seems to shew that
it is not greed that prompts them to leave their snug quarters but
an intuitive impulse of stern necessity.
In the birdroom, in which my birds fly loose, I have found
it best to hang up two or three dimly burning hurricane lamps
during the winter nights. A good class of lamp, costing three
shillings and sixpence in London, is perfectly safe if properly
attended to, and will last through the longest night and help the
birds to an early breakfast in the morning.
STOVES.--Some of our members are fortunate in being
able to have properly constructed aviaries, heated with hot
water pipes ; but there are many who, like myself, have to make
other arrangements for warming the rooms in which their birds
are kept during the winter. A coal fire is unsatisfactory, in
many cases impracticable ; and for man}&apos;&apos; years past I have been
trying gas and paraffin stoves of various kinds. The gas has
long since been rejected; and, of the oil stoves which I
happen to have tried, all have been condemned but Rippengille's.
These differ much, and have their faults, but they can be depended
on. They need never go wrong ; it is entirely one's own fault if
they do. In my dining room, however, they have not been so
successful as in the birdroom. In the former, during the cold
season, I regularly keep some of the more delicate or more
highly valued of my pets ; but, owing to the large bay window
and its proximity to the cold draughty entrance hall, this room
is very cold ; and the ordinary stove has failed to keep up the
temperature sufficiently during severe weather. Last autumn,
I purchased one of Rippengille's hot air radiating tubular
stoves. It is 36m. long x 3oin. high x yin. broad, is not unsightly,
and can be moved about at will, but should not be placed on the
unprotected carpet. Mine has been standing in the window
recess, where it cuts off the draught, and has proved moderately
satisfactory. With the door open some fifteen hours out of the
twenty-four, during the severest weather this winter, the
thermometer, on the wall just opposite the door and some
distance from the stove, has not gone below 53 deg. Fahr., which
is fairly good (a). As a rule, of course, the temperature has been
(a). This stove was not so satisfactory during the high north-east winds of March,
the temperature of the room often falling to 50 deg. After a winter's trial, I have come to
the conclusion that it requires more care and attention, and is less reliable, than many of
those of the ordinary type.--R.P.

up to and above 6o*. It gives remarkably little trouble ; and
although, in cold weather, it consumes a great deal of paraffin, yet
it supplants the coal fire which, with or without the birds would
without it be necessary ; and even for living purposes the room
is distinctly more comfortable than it would be if heated by a
fire, as it is always warm and ready, night and day. The fumes
from all these stoves are slightly objectionable, notwithstanding
that one gets so used to them as not to notice them ; and some-
times I feel sorry that I did not obtain a hot water stove instead ;
but I doubt if a hot water stove of reasonable size would have
kept up the temperature so well ; and it probably would not
have been so convenient in a dining-room.
NESTING BOXES.&apos;--I am under the impression that
inquiries have been made in our pages concerning nesting
boxes. Mrs. Rotch, the mother of our valued member Mr.
Claude D. Rotch, herself an enthusiastic aviculturist, very kindly
gave me the other day a pamphlet published by the Peasant Arts
Society, 8, Queen's Road, Bayswater, London, in which an
account, with illustrations, of nesting boxes for wild birds may
be found, and at which address I understand the nesting boxes
may be obtained. Some of these it seems natural to suppose
would be equally suitable for birds in captivity. Log-nests for
Parrakeets, &amp;c., with saucer-shaped bottoms, so far as I know,
can be obtained in this country only from Mr. J. Abrahams fb ),
192, St. George Street, London, E. See also pp. 39, 128, and 161,
of Vol. VI.
SOFT SOAP.--I was reminded by a lady the other day of a
little, very little, thing which occasionally gives a great deal of
trouble. I refer to the red mite. If soft soap, used as bought, be
smeared over the chinks and crevices in cages and aviaries, 3^011
will not be troubled with vermin of this kind. When cages are
stacked one on the top of another, if soft soap be smeared freel} 7
where the cages come in contact with one another, they ma}^ be
left unmoved for a year and more without the slightest tear. No
fear need be entertained of the birds touching it; only take care
that it be not placed where they may soil their feathers. Care
also should be exercised when nesting boxes are being prepared,
so as not to repel the birds themselves.
I have used soft soap with satisfactory- results for a very
different purpose. Some of the small Parrakeets (I should think
(#) The news of Mr. Abrahams' sudden death must have come as a shock to many
besides myself. His death will be a great loss to the avicultural world.--R. P.

twice before I tried it on with an enraged Cockatoo or an angry
Macaw) are very spiteful, and will attack and freely bite those
who attend to their wants. Thickly smear a finger with
the soap, and place it within their reach. If they bite, hold the
finger again and again up to their beak, until they flee in abject
terror and consternation. I do not know from personal
experience, but have an idea that a good mouthful of soft soap is
not altogether a pleasing morsel to the taste. But it is only soap,
and cannot really hurt either the birds or their plumage.
Again, when a Parrakeet gnaws wood-work which you do not
wish to have injured, smear the same with soft soap ; and the
offender will usually turn his attentions elsewhere. And mice
may often be successfully deterred from climbing by a liberal
application of the same delicious compound to their customary
upward path.
THE SATIN-BIRD.--I am surprised that Mr. Page
(p. 69) should give the height of the Satin-bird's bower as 12 inches.
I11 my garden here I have had them repeatedly nearly or fully
double that height. Probably it depends on the sticks
obtainable, for birds of this species will run off with remarkably
long ones when they have the chance. A 2-3 foot poplar rod, or
shoot of the year, they will carry off with ease. Every spring,
while 1 was pruning my trees, these birds used to come up
behind me--always dead behind me--and steal the loppings of
every size, with which they would cautiously sneak off with the
most intense glee, more than half of their delight being caused I
suspect by the wicked thought in their knavish hearts that I did
not see them and that they were diddling me. If not disturbed,
they will keep on adding to the same bower, year after year, until
it becomes a huge affair.
As regards their moult (p. 7), my Satin-birds, of which I
have had three, used to moult regularly every year just the same as
any other health}'&apos; and moderately hardy bird. The male used to
take two annual moults to gain the adult plumage, but each
moult was complete in itself and was not in the smallest degree
protracted. I quite fail to see why it should be otherwise, for it
is not like a Weaver or other bird coming into colour every year
at the breeding season, but an ordinary case of a bird moulting
into the adult plumage. Dr. Butler's way of putting it, that the
change of colour occupies just a year (p. 8), by a kind of octave
counting is in a sense correct, but perhaps a little misleading.
By one moult it becomes a parti-coloured bird, by the succeeding
annual moult it completes the plumage of the adult male. That

<bodyText confidence="0.992073209302326" page_id="10098681"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
is, it takes, or should take, two annual moults, each one complete
in itself, to finish off the work (c). Where this does not happen,
there must be something wrong with the birds, their aviary, or
their food. I found the same to be the case with the male Naked-
throated Bell-bird f Chasmorhynclnis nudicollis). At one annual
moult it changed from the greenish plumage of the young bird
to a speckled plumage,--whilst bearing which I thought it
looked its best--and at the succeeding annual moult it became
pure white. To return to the Satin-bird, as Mr. Page infers, the
age at which the male commences to don the plumage of the
adult is not certainly known. I feel inclined to say that the
young male does not put on a single dark feather until it is at
the very least three years old.
The Satin-bird is too bulky and boisterous for the birds I
now keep, but I can most strongly recommend it to those who
have plenty of space to spare. In a large well-sheltered Wilder-
ness, with snug winter quarters attached, it would breed. Even
in their unsuitable aviary at the Zoological Gardens, eggs have
been dropped about I am told ; and last summer they even went
so far as to build a nest in a box tree. But it is a Wilderness
they require, not a trimly kept parterre like their home at the
Zoo. To do well, this species should have a really large place,
with abundance of grass and green food growing naturally. It
is an active powerful bird and requires much exercise ; and, as it
will sample every leaf, care must be exercised in the selection of
the trees and shrubs planted within its domain.

REVIEW.
Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds , by Archibald James Campbell ,
Melboztrne. (Pawson &amp; Brailsford , Sheffield ), imp. 8 vo., 1901.
This very important work has at length appeared, and so
greatly advances the knowledge of the nidification of the Birds
of Australia that it undoubtedly ought to find a place in the
library of every scientific aviculturist. The book is a bulky one,
inasmuch as it contains (with its indices) no less than 1102 pages
(c). My ' way of putting it ' was simply stating a fact: the colouring of the body
changed so gradually that, if produced by a continuous moult, only one or two small
feathers can have been dropped on the same day : at first only two or three black feathers
appeared on the whole body, but twelve months later these had increased in number to the
extent of a complete change of colour. My birds have been in absolutely perfect health
from the beginning. The only moult in the year of large feathers only, which I was aware
of (the only one in which feathers remained on the floor of the aviary) was between July and
September, 1900 : both birds have been in perfect plumage since then.--A. G. B.

of letterpress ; in addition to portraits of the late John Gould
and the author, a map, 28 coloured plates, and 131 photographic
illustrations.
Instead of quoting synonyms, Mr. Campbell has wisely
contented himself with a simple reference to the British Museum
* Catalogue of Birds ' and one good figure ; thus the whole of the
text is devoted to practical information ; the latter is arranged
much as in niv "Handbook of British Oology" under the headings
of ' Geographical Distribution&apos; ' Nest ,' ' Eggs,&apos; and &apos;'Observations&apos;&apos;;
the period of nidification, when known, being noted under the
last heading instead of (as in my little book) forming a separate
heading. In many cases the observations are most interesting.
The portrait of Gould, taken five years before his death,
is admirable, but gives little idea of his appearance when in full
vigour ; as I first knew him in the sixties. The photographs of
nests and nesting sites are, for the most part, very good ; those
most interesting to the Aviculturist will probably be the nest of
the Satin Bower Bird, opposite p. 192; of the White-backed
Magpie, facing p. 292; the White-eye or Zosterops, p. 348 ; the
nesting-place of a Pardalote, p. 448 ; nest of the Masked Wood-
Swallow, p. 466; young Laughing Jackasses, p. 552; taking a
White Cockatoo's nest, p. 612; Ant hillock, showing nest of the
Beautiful Parrakeet, p.646; egg mound of Megapode, p. 702;
nest of the Black Swan, p. 1014 ; finding an Emu's nest, p. 1058 ;
Emu's nest, p. 1060; but one of the most charming pictures in
the book is the ' Home of the Parra (Jacana),' p. 774.
As regards the coloured plates, that of the Rose-breasted
Robins and Nest, p. 142, is not a success ; and is more suitable
for a children's magazine than a scientific work : it is a pity it
was included. The coloured illustrations of the eggs are
characteristic, but some of them a little flat. One can hardly
hope for absolute perfection in any human work, and Mr.
Campbell's book is so good generally, that we must not complain
if the coloured illustrations do not equal the photographs in
excellence. A. G Butler.

Sir,--W ill you please let me know the proper treatment for the
following case.
A cock Crimson Wing was brought in by my man to-day with
inflammation in one eye.

The eye seems rather swollen and inflamed, and the bird keeps it
shut as much as possible. The other eye seems perfectly right. I have
bathed the eye in weak boracic lotion, and am keeping the bird warm.
Would you tell me if I can do anything more, and if the bird is likely
to lose the sight of the eye ? It has been in a large outdoor aviary all the
winter, and is otherwise in perfect health.
Would you also tell me if I can give anything beyond seeds and fruit
to a hen Eclectus, who is sitting on eggs ? Will she require bread and milk
if the eggs hatch? M. Johnstone.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Johnstone.
Your Crimson Wing has doubtless taken cold in some form, but it is
impossible to say off-hand what the result may be. If the bird has had a
thorough chill, which is exceedingly likely, the loss of one or both eyes
may follow: nay, more--the bird may linger on and die. But if it be a
simple case of a cold in the eye from sitting in a draught, if your treat-
ment was not delayed, there is hope that the eye may be saved.
Keep the bird comfortably warm in an even temperature day and
night, and be most careful to exclude even a suspicion of a draught. Bathe
the affected eye rather frequently with warm water, as warm as the bird can
bear without hurt. Twice, or not more frequently than thrice, in the day,
add a little lotion to the warm water. I hardly like too much of the boracic
lotion. You might try a change, at any rate temporarily, to the simple
old-fashioned zinc-and-rose-water. Attend carefully to the general health
of the bird, and carefully avoid any stimulating or heating food. A little
fluid magnesia in the drinking water now and then might be beneficial,
especially if the inflammation continue. Do not bathe the other eye so long
as it seems to be all right, or it might catch any possible infection.
Food for a Parrot with young should, as far as practicable, be simply
an enlargement on that to which it has been accustomed. A new food,
however valuable, may be avoided because it is strange, or it may be
partaken of too freely and temporarily upset the bird's system. You
mention fruit as part of the birds' food : give plenty of it. If accustomed
to bananas, supply them freely ; also grapes if the birds have been having
them. I should certainly give a little bread (I prefer biscuit) and milk (or
bread moistened with water)--and watch. I always add to my seed Huntley
and Palmer&apos;s " Tea" biscuits crumbled up ; this the birds eat dry and quite
naturally, but it quickly softens into pulp in the crop ; nevertheless do not
give too much. I also cut up. and place on the top of the seed, dr}&apos; bits of
date and fig, I mean, as little sticky as may be. I also give the best
sultana raisins, carefully cleaned, and cut in halves. Doubtless you give
them maize. If you give oranges, I would not give milk at the same time,
as the acidity of the orange might act on the milk.
May I express a hope that you will send an account of this interesting
case to the Magazine ! Reginald Phieeipps.
Mrs. yohnstone states further :--
The Crimson Wing at any rate seems no worse ; but the hen has also
a bad eye; it appears glazed over like a white film. She has also lost the
use of one foot: I never saw anything like it before. I noticed she perched

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.993245163265306" page_id="10098684"  page_num="127" year="" vol="">
awkwardly about November. It is no worse; but on close examination I see
the use of the foot has gone. The other foot is all right, but this one seems
quite stiff and helpless. They always roosted in a mass of logs and bracken
but I fear this very severe weather has been more than they can stand.
The Red-sided Eclectus, my man now tells me, has only one egg as
far as he can see; it is difficult to judge as she is nesting in a long log-nest.
She laid once previously one egg, but it proved clear. She sits very closely,
and only comes off to take a few seeds, and, if she hear a sound, darts back
to the nest. The cock never feeds her as far as I can see. Should the egg
hatch, I will certainly write again. M. Johnstone.
The following ftirther reply was forwarded to Mrs. Johnstone.
I fear much that nothing can be done for your female Crimson Wing
but to give gentle warmth and nursing, simple food, and fluid magnesia
occasionally in the drinking water. I would not worry this bird by bathing
the eye if there be no apparent inflammation ; from what you say, it is too
late. The mischief has been done. It is possible, but exceedingly unlikely,
that these two birds may have pricked their eyes in the aviary. Dead gorse
might do this; but you mention only the innocent bracken. It seems to
me that your birds were in too good health and condition (notwithstand-
ing the foot) to be killed outright by the cold, but that it has most seriously
affected their system. If they recover, with the loss of only one eye each,
it is the best that may be hoped for I fear.
If the female has ?iot received any injury, the loss of the use of one foot
probably will have been caused by difficulty of some sort in connection
with egg-production,--probably set up by cold. The desire of these auti-
podeans to nest during our cold season is a source of great danger and
difficulty. It seems now too late to do anything. Gentle warmth and
quiet, simple diet, and a well-shaded corner into which she can retreat from
all glare and disturbance, hold out the only possible hopes.
I am very much interested in what you say about the Eclectus. Tell
your man not to disturb her in any way, but (apparently) to ignore her
existence as far as possible. I cannot call to mind any instance of an
Eclectus having laid in this country. Reginald Phileipps.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
Sir, --Mr. Wiener invites the experiences of those who have kept
Gouhlian Finches, and, although I believe I have recorded mine on more
than one occasion, for the benefit of those who may not have seen it, I do
so again.
With me the Gouldian Finches have always been the simplest and
hardiest of tropical birds to keep: living for } - ears, breeding most freelv,
and always appearing in perfect health and condition. The management
is so simple that it practically amounts to none at all. The} - are placed in
pairs in the open aviary at the end of April or in the beginning of May, one
pair in a compartment. I do not find that more than one pair nest satis-
factorily in a compartment, however large it maybe; but this I think is
not the experience of some.
They moult out in the spring and early summer, slowly at first, very
quickly afterwards, commence nesting in August, and rear two broods of
young ones between then and October. In numbers from three to six.

practically all eggs are hatched and all young reared. In November I
catch them up, and place each family with its parents in roomy open wire
cages, called, I believe, waggon-shaped ; these are stood on tables in a
window of an ordinary living room, and, beyond being kept free from any
draught, have no particular attention. Abundance of coarse sharp sand,
plenty of baked and crushed egg shell, a lump of rock salt (which is
moistened every morning) in each cage, plants of Poa annua pulled from
any neglected path or road side, seeding cliickweed when procurable--is
all that is necessary, beside the ordinary canar}&amp;quot; seed, spray millet, and
white millet. Although I see that the old birds are very fond of eating
3&apos;oung shooting grass from the lawns in their aviaries, I do not detect that
the)&apos; feed the young on anything but hard seed.
Mv birds have never wished to nest again after they were brought in
from their outdoor aviaries, and have never wished to rear more than two
broods. The 3&apos;oung remain long in the nest, and do not leave until
practical^&apos; full grown and strong on the wing.
When in the open aviar3 r they of course have access to the rock salt
and egg shell that is supplied to all other birds.

THE WHITE-BREAvSTED MANNIKIN.
Sir, -- I bought a pair of birds from a well-known importer a few days
ago, which he called Pectoralis Finches. I cannot find any description
tallying with these finches in any book I possess, and will be obliged if
you can aid me in any way.
The following is a description of the cock : Size nearly equal to the
Ribbon Finch ; top of head and front of face black, a narrow band round
this, golden brown ; back and wings pale brown with minute white spots;
a patch on breast (like the violet patch on a Gouldian Finch, but shallower)
a mixture of brown and white feathers ; under parts brown, becoming paler
towards and shading into white at the vent; tail dark brown; bill slate-
coloured ; legs and feet pink-brown shade. The hen is not so clearly
marked. They seem to thrive on canary and millet.
I enclose a rough drawing, shewing the distribution of colours.
John Foueis.
The following reply was se?it to Mr. Foul is :
The bird yon describe is the Pectoral Finch or White - breasted
Mannikin (Munia pectoralis) from North-West Australia.
Until quite recently it was very rarel3 7 imported indeed. I remember
seeing one at a bird show at Brighton in 1896, and I think this must have
been almost if not quite the first living specimen seen in this country.
During the last year or two, however, quite a number have arrived, and it
cannot now be considered rare.
I have had about lialf-a-dozeu specimens in my aviary for about a
year, and have found them quite hardy but sliy and uninteresting. They
have made no attempt at nest-building to my knowledge, although I once
witnessed a most comical love dance; the female standing still on the
ground facing her mate, who, with lowered head and expanded tail, hopped
from side to side with great rapidity.
Canary and millet seed are about all tlie3 r require. D. Seth-SmiTh.

By Frank Finn, F.Z.S.
I have already treated of the best-known species of the
Duck family in my series on Fancy Waterfowl in the " Feathered
World " of last year-which, by the way, is now available in
book form and as Mr. Seth-Smith has complained in a recent
number of our Magazine of the paucity of articles on these birds
I am emboldened to offer a few remarks on some species which
are very little known as yet, but of which I have been fortunate
in having personal experience. Of these the most generally
attractive and deserving of importation is
Ihr Cotton Teal (Nettopus coromatidelianus).
This most charming little creature is often known as the
Pigmy Goose or Goose-Teal, but wrongly so, as neither in its
plumage or in its habits does it display any affinity to the true
Geese; and, although its bill is strikingly like that of a Goose
in miniature, its general build is very different, the neck wiims
and legs being short, and the tail long and rounded. It is almost
the smallest of all ducks, being less than an ordinary Pio- e on
but it is nevertheless remarkably showy. That is to say* the
drake is, his plumage being mostly white, with wings of a dark
metallic green marked with a big white patch on the flights- a
black cap necklace and tail, and flanks delicately pencilled with
fine black lines. His bill is black, feet olive-yellow with black
webs, and eyes ruby red. The duck is dark brown where the
drake is black or green, and has no black necklace or white
wing-patch ; her flanks are plain drab, and her neck is pencilled
with brown There is also a dark brown streak passing alono-
the side of the head through the eye, which gives her a
particularly pretty and innocent expression. Her bill is
yellowish brown, and her feet duller than the drake's, while her
eyes are brown also. Young birds resemble her, and so does

the drake when in his undress plumage, a garb which he puts
on in winter, not in summer like other drakes which undergo
this change. He may, however, always be distinguished by the
green and white of the wings, which do not change.
The Cotton-Teal, as it is called by Anglo-Indians, is
almost the commonest duck in India, and is not migratory. It
is not considered a very good table bird, but hundreds are,
nevertheless, brought into the market at Calcutta for sale as food
during the wild-fowl-netting season in our " cold weather" here.
It has, however, very rarely been sent to Europe, as it is by no
means an easy bird to keep in close confinement, although when
let loose on a pond or in a large aviary with plenty of water, it
thrives very well and becomes remarkably tame--not to say
cheeky, for it does not appear to have much respect for larger
ducks, and I have seen one show a bold front to an obtrusive
crow. It is a most active little bird, a fast swimmer and a very
good diver, and very agile on the wing. On land, however, it is
at a great disadvantage, being naturally weak in the legs and
hence readily disabled. Although not by any means unable to
walk, as stated by some writers, it does not like to go more than
a few feet at a time, and is very apt to collapse when it tries to
turn round or go fast! It seems also never to stand on one leg
like other ducks. Yet its feet are strong enough for some
purposes, as it perches readily, being naturally a builder in trees,
and will cling or climb up wire-netting in a manner remarkable
in a duck. Herein lies the difficulty of keeping it in any
ordinary cage ; it will climb up the sides, to fall ruinously down
again; and if debarred from clambering will jump and flutter
foolishly.
Hence, when I sent some to the London Zoo four years ago,
I had to devise some means for keeping them penned up and yet
uninjured. This I managed by confining them in a metal tank
about four feet by three, with a movable wire-netting cover.
Into this was put daily a few inches of water, the foul water of
the day before being let off by a plug, while a flat cage or a
plank supported on two bricks set on edge served as a resting-
platfonn for the dozen birds I kept confined. Of course at
flighting-time at nightfall they waddled along the platform and
sprang up, but, falling back into the water, did not hurt them-
selves, and so " survived successfully," as Mr. Kipling's Babu
says. After several weeks of this they were very tame and quiet,
and I sent them home in a cage just high enough for them to
stand upright in, and provided with a deep detachable tin
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999045476190476" page_id="10098690"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
bottom which could be filled with water to give them a bath,
the bottom of the cage itself being barred, as those of all
travelling-cages should be.
Nevertheless, although every care was taken of them by
Mr. C. Fawns, Steward of the " City of Oxford," who very
kindly looked after them for me, only three survived the voyage.
I think I should have sent them in a cage divided into more
compartments. As it was, I had two only, with six birds in
each, and, though there was ample room for any ordinary birds
of the size, I fear these active but clumsy little things must have
trampled each other.
The food presented no difficulty : paddy (raw unhusked
rice) and canary-seed are eaten readily by these birds, and I
found they would also take grass cut fine, as well as the maggots
commonly given to insectivorous birds here. Naturally, they
feed mostly on small shell-fish and water-weeds, pecking about
on the surface more like a Waterhen than a Duck. They will
dive for food on occasion, but not readily or neatly like a Duck,
and when they tilt up their tails in ordinary duck-fashion, they
do it as quickly as they possibly can, not standing on their heads
for several seconds at a time like the others.
As I remarked above, they are very easy to tame ; one I
turned out on our large pond in the Museum grounds here, in a
very few days began to swim to me whenever I appeared, as she
laboured under the impression that I always had paddy secreted
about my person. In this she was mistaken, for as the pond was
full of natural food I did not feed her except occasionally ; but
she bore no malice for frequent disappointments, and stayed
for sometime, although full-winged when I turned her out. She
was then too weak to fly away, as far too many of the poor birds
fresh from the market are ; indeed, many of these Teal cannot
even stand at first.
I think the Cotton-Teal, if kept in a large aviary or well-
protected pond, would probably be easy to breed ; as I have seen
the birds courting in the fine Duck aviary at the Calcutta Zoo.
When they are doing this the drake bends down his bill so as to
arch his neck and show off its showy whiteness, and jerks open
his quills to display the otherwise concealed white patch. He is
a gallant little fellow, and will not peck the gentler sex of his
own species, as I had many opportunities of seeing when I had
them closely confined. From what I saw, however, I think two
drakes in a small space would probably damage each other

severely at breeding-time, like so many other Dncks. They
build in holes at a moderate height from the ground.
Owing to the difficulty of procuring sound and steady
birds for shipment, and the care they require on the voyage, this
species is not likely to be readily obtainable for some time to
come. Still, a few have reached England since I sent the first
specimens above-mentioned, and, as everyone here admires the
pretty quaint little birds, they only need to be better known to
be thoroughly appreciated by amateurs of waterfowl, especially
by those who have no room for big Ducks.
The Pink-headed Duck ( Rhodo?iessa caryopliyllacea).
This most extraordinary-looking bird differs from the
Cotton-Teai in being very hard to get and very easy to manage
when you have got it. Only a few birds annually come on sale
in Calcutta, and these are expensive as wildfowl go here, but
their habits are not such as to give rise to any difficulty in
managing them, being very similar to those of the Mallard.
The " Pink-header," as he is often irreverently called out here in
India, is also much like that bird in size and shape, but is rather
smaller and decidedly slimmer in build, the head and neck being
almost gaunt in appearance. The wings are also shorter, for
this Duck does not migrate, and, indeed, is not found outside
India.
Its colour is most remarkable ; the body is brownish black,
with a fawn coloured wing-bar and the quills also shaded with
that hue, while the head is pink--a bright rose-pink in the
drake, and a dull smutty pink in the duck. Both have black
feet, but they differ much in the colour of their bills, the drake's
being fleshy white, and the duck's black. Young birds are light
in colour below, and have heads of a sort of drab hue. The
drake does not go out of colour to any great extent, only getting
a black streak on the crown, which the duck always has.
This bird is allied, by the structure of the male's wind-
pipe, and by the peculiar wing-pattern, to the Pochards, but it is
a true surface-feeder in all its habits, although I saw one recently
dive just as neatly as a Pochard, and stay under as long. But as
some other Ducks were playing at the time, I think he was only
in fun. Certainly one I kept for a long time on the Museum
pond never attempted to dive for food as my diving Ducks do.
The drake has a most peculiar two-syllabled call, which he often
utters--something like "wugh-ali," with a metallic ring to it.
The species has never, I believe, been bred in Europe, though it

has been not unfrequently sent home, and it lives well at our
Zoo here. It is a ground-builder, and lays round eggs something
like billiard balls ; I have always considered it more curious
than truly beautiful, but it always attracts notice, and is well
worth attention on the part of anyone who can get hold of it.
The Bronze-Cap (.Eunetla falcata ).
This bird is very often dubbed a Teal, but it is really too
big to fairly claim the title, being as large as the well-known
Gadwall. Indeed, the females of the two birds are so much alike
that it is as well to mention their points of difference explicitly.
The female Gadwall, then, has more or less orange on the bill
and feet, and a white bar on the wing, while the Bronze-Cap
female has an entirely black bill, grey feet, and a black wing-bar.
The Bronze-Cap drake is a most beautiful bird, and would
be preferred by many people to the gorgeous Mandarin himself,
though personally I do not think any species can compare with
him, as he has character as well as beauty.
The Bronze-Cap, however, is very lovely, with his silky
copper-and-green head and mane, white neck, and body
exquisitely pencilled with black and white lines, the whole set
off by the long curved sickles formed by the innermost or
tertiary quills of the wing. The tail-coverts are also peculiar,
being so long that they reach to the end of the tail, giving the
bird a rather stump-ended appearance; but their colouring
makes some amends, the lower ones being rich cream-coloured
and black. The wing-sickles are black laced with grey, and are
the last parts of the full plumage to make their appearance.
The Bronze-Cap properly inhabits Eastern Asia, and was
scarce and dear when Miss Hubbard wrote on Ornamental
Waterfowl, and still remains so. 1 have never seen it in the
London Zoo. Of late years, however, it has turned up pretty
frequently at the Calcutta market, having been less uncommon in
India than it was, so that I am in hopes, if the invasion continues,
that some consignments may reach Europe hence. I know that
a pair I got for my friend, Mr. W. Rutledge, were sold to go
home and that the drake arrived safely. But as a rule drakes are
hard to get, and almost all I have got lately have been ducks. I
gave Mr. Fawns four the other day, and if an}&apos; of these come
on the market I should advise duck-keepers to try crossing one
with a Gadwall drake. The hybrid would probably be fertile,
and the pure stock could be secured by breeding back, as was
formerly done with the Amherst and Golden Pheasants.

Baer's Pochard (. Nyroca baeri ).
This is another East Asiatic Duck which has taken to
invading India of late years, and in considerable though now
dwindling numbers. When it first arrived, as it was then not
known from India and new to the London Zoo, I sent them
specimens, and since then our Zoological Society has sent a
further consignment.
Baer's Pochard is very like the familiar White-eyed
Pochard, but differs from it by being rather larger and slighter
in make ; in having a deep green instead of mahogany-red head ;
and in showing a good deal of white on the flanks. As in its
ally, the eyes are white in drakes and dark in ducks. The
green-glossed head of the female makes her handsomer than
any other female Pochard, these birds being generally so lamen-
tably dowdy, and the drake does not go out of colour to any
great extent, so that the species may fairly be called a desirable
one. But it is not likely ever to be so popular as any of the
others I have mentioned, supposing them all to be available in
Europe at any time. Nothing, however, is known of its breeding-
habits, so anyone who gets a pair and succeeds in breeding them
will be adding a new fact to the history of the Duck family.
The only interesting point I have myself noticed about the bird--
and I have kept pinioned specimens on our pond at the Indian
Museum for some years--is that it rises on the wing more readily
than other Pochards, an observation I was able to make in the
Duck Aviary at the Zoo here, where the birds are of course
allowed the use of their wings. This, if it shows superior
power of flight, may account for the somewhat erratic habits of
the species, which is not regular in appearance even in its more
proper haunts in China.
For some time it was thought to be a hybrid ; and,
certainly, when I first saw specimens in the market, I put it
down as such, as I did not then know the species. But since
then I have seen many, and there is no doubt it is a distinct
form. Birds in the dusty-brown of immaturity are, however, very
like young White-eyed Pochards, but may be easily distinguished
by their larger size and darker crown, a young Duck of this
species being as big as an old White-eyed drake.

By The Hon. Mrs. Carpenter.
I find the accounts in the Magazine of other people's
aviaries of such absorbing interest that perhaps even my humble
efforts in this line may be interesting to other beginners. My
first aviary was built three years ago, in April, 1897, against the
glass west end of a conservatory, which thus protects it from the
east and slightly warms that side of it. It is a cube of 7ft. to the
eave of the roof which is a gabled one, sloping north and south.
The lower half of the south side of the roof is of glass to let in
more sun ; the upper half and whole north side of roof of boards
covered with tarred felt.
The front of the aviary to the south is the only open side,
covered with smallest mesh wire netting; about 2ft. of the west
side of glass, the rest of this side and the whole of the back of
boards covered with tarred felt. The floor is of cement on a
brick foundation, and raised about 8 inches off&amp;quot; the ground.
In the winter a woollen blind is drawn down over the wire
front of the aviary at night.
In this aviary I have kept for the last three years,
with varying success, Parson Finches, Diamond Sparrows,
Silverbills, Avadavats, Green Avadavats, Bronzewing Mannikins,
Zebra Finches, Zebra Waxbills, a White - throated Finch,
Combassous, Bullfinches, Goldfinches, Nonpareils, lien- Green-
finches, and hen Canaries. Too many for breeding to be very
successful, but I have bred a lot of Zebra Finches and twice
Bronze-winged Mannikins, though of these last the only one that
lived to come out of the nest was then abandoned by its one
surviving parent (the hen having died soon after the young
were hatched) and died in spite of my attempts at feeding it by
hand. I also bred in this aviary a hybrid between a cock Siskin
and hen Greenfinch, a very fine strong bird which I had brought
up by hand when old enough, but which unfortunately escaped
from its cage in the summer.
This is a very cold and damp place in the north of
Yorkshire, and the birds have withstood 35 to40degrees of frost
last winter, and intense damp cold this winter, and have all looked
well and happy except hen Avadavats, hen Green Avadavats,
and hen Combassous, which, though they did not actually die
during the coldest weather, suffered from it and died last spring.
The cock birds of all these species do not appear to mind the
cold, but I noticed that the cock Avadavat, who has been out

two winters and was brilliantly red when I turned him out, has
never come properly into colour again, having only patches of
red about the breast all the year round. I consider the Silver-
bills about the hardiest of all these birds. They never even
look cold. I have also had a Tong-tailed Grassfinch out all this
winter and it seems perfectly hardy. It sings occasionally--
a sort of weak Parson Finch's song--so I thought it was a
cock bird, but have recently discovered it was sitting on a nest-
ful of eggs, and as its only friend in the aviary is a cock Zebra
Finch I am beginning to think it must be a hen bird in spite of
its song. The eggs, however, have all turned out bad.
I afterwards added another aviary at the back of the first
one, consisting of about 12 ft. by 7 ft. wire run, and a house with
cement floor at the end for the birds to feed and roost in.
It is colder and less sunny than the other, but I have bred
lots of Budgerigars and Canaries besides Redpolls and Linnets
in it ; and Saffron F&apos;inches nested, but were easily disturbed, and
proved so quarrelsome--not to say murderous--that I had to get
rid of them. The Budgerigars do not seem to mind any amount
of cold, and nest all the year round. The water in this aviary is
often frozen solid. I hope to let in more sunshine from the south-
west by cutting down a tree. I am sure sunshine is almost the
most important point to consider in choosing the site for an
aviary.

(Continued from page 124).
Since the foregoing was written, I have received Mr. A. J.
Campbell's new book, " Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds," in
which appears a remarkable statement made by the Director of
the Zoological Gardens, Melbourne. Concerning a certain male
Satin-bird in captivity, the author writes,--" It is interesting to
learn that this bird did not don its full livery of blue-black till
the fourth year." Appended to this remark, a foot-note by the
Director runs as follows :--" I think this particular bird must
have been of mature years when Mr. Bailey first got it, as many
years ago I caged a number (at least a dozen) of these birds at
the gardens here, young green birds, caught at Gembrook, and it
was only after the expiration of nearly eight years they began to
change colour. I think four or five birds put on the beautiful
blue-black plumage, and in a year or two died off. It is, there-

<bodyText confidence="0.999414651162791" page_id="10098696"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
fore, evident that the birds only come to their full plumage
in old age, and that accounts for the fact that in a flock of say
one hundred birds, which we often used to see at Gembrook,
some years ago, there would be only a very few, not half-a-dozen
black ones among them. They die off shortly after the change."
I cannot help feeling very strongly that the conclusions arrived
at by the Director should be received with great caution. Birds
in captivity do not always moult the same as in the wild state.
Look at the Nonpareil, and even some of our British species !
I remember reading of a Naked-throated Bell-bird, I think in
Germany, which one year, like my specimen already referred to,
moulted from the green to the speckled plumage but, unlike my
bird, never moulted into the pure white of the adult male,
although moulting annually at the proper season. See also my
notes below on the moulting of the Regent-bird. If the
accommodation at the Melbourne Gardens is as unsuitable as at
our own, and the food equally unsuitable (my Satin-birds would
graze growing grass like geese, and lived mainly on growing
vegetable matter, to which I added various fruits), it is quite
conceivable that the development of the plumage into that of the
adult may have been deferred. Again, the Satin-bird has all the
appearance of a long-lived species, not one that would naturally
die off in nine or ten years. That it should don its wedding
plumage only in old age seems contrary to all experience.
A creature that is slow to develop is a slow one to die is the
almost universal law. If the Director's birds had been in their
wild haunts, they would probably have carried the blue-black
livery of the adult male for many a long year.
[Immediately after having penned the foregoing, I wrote to
our fellow member Mr. Victor Castellan, asking him if he would
kindly let me know what had become of the male Satin Bower-
bird which he had purchased from me on the 13th July, 1898.
This bird had shewn his first black feather on the 20th July,
1896, and completed his dark plumage in the autumn of 1897--
more than three years ago. Mr. Castellan, in a letter dated 6th
March, replies as follows :--" In reply to your note re Satin
Bower-bird, I am glad to say that the specimen I bought off you
is doing very well, and is very much alive. We find him a most
amusing bird ; the variety of his calls is numberless. He also
has the habit of collecting all the stones he can find in one
corner of his aviary. I have also noticed that when he is in his
outside flight in the summer he tries to stick bits of twigs and
grass into the ground, but has so far never built a bower. His

plumage is beautiful, and in the sun a splendid shining blue-
black. He has been so since I have had him." It will be seen,
therefore, that this bird, which has been in full colour for three
years and a half, is still " very much alive " ; and, if no accident
should occur, I shall be surprised if he does not continue to be
" very much alive " for years to come. R. P.]
THE REGENT BIRD.--Although quite right as to
the rarity of the Golden Bovver-bird, Mr. Page is behind the
times when he supposes (p. 69; that the Regent has not been
imported. For some years it has been an occasional--but
unwilling--visitor to this country ; it lias been represented at
the Loudon Zoological Gardens more than once ; and even so
recently as this latest month of February an adult male has been
exhibited at the Palace--but its merits cannot be observed in a
cage. I have had three specimens myself, and still have one--
an inimatu:e male. Of the three species of Bower-birds which
I have kept, taking all things into consideration, I prefer the
Regent; but it is not nearly so robust as the Satin-bird, nor is it
nearly so diligent, at least with me, in its building of bovvers ;
but perhaps this is owing to the cold driving it so much into the
house. There is a peculiarity about some (for they are not all
constructed on the same plan) of the bowers of this species
which I have never seen mentioned by any writer. Mr. Campbell
does not speak of it ; but unwittingly and very opportunely he
seems to have supplied an explanation of the peculiarity of
which I was wholly unconscious. In the exact centre of the
bower, which I have not seen used as a " run," a " nest," of the
size of a saucer, is carefully prepared ; and all the bird's
treasures, consisting in my aviary of small stones, are deposited
in this " nest." Now let me quote from Mr. Campbell's new
Book :--" Archie's own observations concerning birds he saw
performing in this bower are : ' When first seen there were three
birds playing in the bower; two were what we took to be males
--but they were immature--and the other was a female. The
antics they went through were extraordinary, and they were not
in the least disturbed by our presence. One would go into the
centre of the bower and, picking up a shell, of which there were
three, would dance, half opening its wings and then tossing the
shell in the air or over its head would run out. While this was
going on the other two birds outside were scraping or sweeping
the ground with their wings, and when the shell fell, one would
pick it up and enter the bower to go through the same
performance as the first bird, and so on. There were four or five

fresh young leaves in the bower at the time, and on visiting the
locality the following afternoon, these were seen to be thrown
out and four fresh ones placed in their stead.'" Although there
does not seem to have been any special receptacle in the centre
of this bower, yet the bird is stated to have gone into the centre
of the bower for its shell, just where my Regent had a specially
prepared Partridge-nest-like receptacle for his treasures. No
pen can describe the antics of the bird when courting in the
vicinity of his bower ; they are wonderful beyond description,
much more so than are those of the Satin-bird, which are more
ridiculous than any clown's foolery. But the writer of the
foregoing account of the wild Regents and their bower is silent
on a very interesting point ; perhaps he was too far off to hear.
All my Regent's antics are accompanied by indescribable notes
and noises, not loud, but all expressive and quite in keeping with
the general weirdness of the performance. It is to a female
Pied Rock-Thrush that my Regent pays homage, to the intense
disgust of her own long-suffering mate. Talking of notes and
noises, the Satin Bower-bird has a goodly collection, but the
Regent has more, for it has a pleasing song. Hiding away in a
sheltered corner, he will warble away by the hour, not loudly but
softly and sweetly, rather like the Pied Rock-Thrush, but more
varied. To what extent his notes are borrowed, I do not know.
I notice that, a year ago, I likened the song to the suppressed
voices of a very large flock of Starlings, all in their full spring
song.
Concerning the plumage of this species, Mr. A. J.
Campbell writes :--" The youthful male resembles the female ;
the second year the bill is yellowish ; the third or fourth year the
plumage is complete." My present bird, when received on the
4th August, 1899, had just a little yellow on the wings. During
the moult of that autumn, he put on a trifle more yellow but no
black. In July, 1900, he commenced growing a few yellow and
black flights ; and during the autumn his bill became yellower,
and the head assumed a faint wash of the same colour. Judging
by my earlier specimens and this bird, and others I have seen, I
think that the Regent either takes a longer period to come into
full colour than Air. Campbell supposes, or else that the due
development of the colour is greatly retarded by the coldness of
our climate, or the adverse influences of a life in captivity.
THE PALACE SHOW.--My reference to the Regent-
bird at the Palace brings another thought to my mind. I think
it is not unfair to suggest that if Exhibitors would be more

careful with their labels it would save much confusion. This
year is not the first that Exhibitors' errors have brought an
unfortunate press reporter into trouble. On the Saturday of this
year's Show, I read a report of it in a London daily. The
unfortunate wight who penned the report evidently didn't know
a Waxbill from a Woodpecker, but thought he would be treading
on safe ground if he commented on the first prize winners as
printed in the catalogue. Accordingly, but with professional
caution and vagueness, he spoke with lofty wisdom of the tenant
of the cage which was catalogued as No. 2223, Blue-cheeked
Barbet, winner of the first prize in Class 126--thus the catalogue
be it remembered. On reading that a Blue-cheeked Barbet had
won the first prize in this class, I expressed myself strongly to
my Better-Half, declaring that the Show would not be worth the
bother of a journey to the Palace if a bird so common, so
easily obtained, so often exhibited, and one that keeps itself
in health and plumage without troubling its owner, could be
the best bird in the class. However, we came to the conclusion
that it was just au incompetent judge--which w&apos;as a little hard
on the judge.
On the Monday, when I visited the Show, I found that
all four of the birds exhibited in this Class by one gentleman had
been placed in the wrong cages. On inspecting the cages, the Blue-
cheeked Barbet and first prize winner of the catalogue and press
reporter became a Regent-bird, the Regent-bird of the catalogue
became a Sacred Kingfisher, the Sacred Kingfisher became a
Masked Wood Swallow, and the Masked Wood Swallow became
the Blue-cheeked Barbet, which looked queer, and had been
altogether ignored by the unjustly-judged judge. This kind of
thing is unfair to the visitors, and the refinement of cruelty to
those members of the press who do not know a Hangnest from
a Shama (Vol. II., p. 91), or a Barbet from a Regent.
MICE.--Dr. Butler tells us fp. 78) of traps for birds. If
somebody would tell us of traps which would catch mice in the
midst of abundance of seed and other food, the whole avicultural
world would rise up and call him blessed. I do not understand
to what little gin traps Mr. Cooper refers (p. 86) which can be
baited with sunflower seeds 4 will he not enlighten us? The
mice soon learn all about traps and poison, and any new trap is
a help. As to poison, I have raised a breed of mice here which,
generation after generation, have been so successfully
" inoculated " that they are practically immune. They will eat
" Battle " regularly, and not only live but increase and multiply
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999269674418605" page_id="10098700"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
upon it. I ventured to suggest adulteration to the chemist, but
he pooh-poohed the idea ; and I suppose he was right, for one
wandered into niv neighbour's garden, and "caught " and killed
his cat : at least it looked very much like it. One case was too
remarkable to leave unrecorded. I have seen it stated that the
females of various animals, when with young, are exempt from
the usual deadly consequences of a snake's bite. I do not know
if this be true; and the following instance is not altogether to the
point, as the poison from a snake's bite affects the system
differently from that taken internally. Some sixteen months
ago, a pair of mice discovered a sack of Indian millet in a spare
but very full bed-room, and comfortably settled down. Before
long, I detected the attack on the seed (which I removed), laid
down poison, and killed the male. The female continued to live
in the room, and, having nothing else to feed upon, took the
poison freely, so freely that I took an interest in the case and let
her have her fill. In due course she built a nest of scraps of
paper, on a table, under a cloth (up which she used to climb)
which covered various articles on the table. For as long as I
dared, I spared the young, in the hopes of being able to catch the
mother, still regularly feeding her with poison, spread as usual
on thin bread and butter. Eventually I made a sudden raid on
the nest, killed all the young, but missed the mother who had
been in the nest. Shortly afterwards, she turned up in the
dining-room, and established herself behind a book-case ; and
there she remained for several weeks, for nearly three months I
think, living on the seed scattered by the birds and occasional
doses of poison. Then the birds were removed to their summer
quarters in the garden, the room was " turned out," and the
mouse killed. It was sickly, having a large growth on the neck,
but was still alive although it must have eaten several packets of
Battle's Vermin Killer, which I understand is principally com-
posed of strychnine.
In the house I have been able to control the mice ; but in
the garden I must confess that, this year for the first time, I have
been discomfited, and am in despair. During the hard weather
in February, I suppose they ran short of food, for I caught a few
in break-back traps. On two occasions, when I inspected the
traps in the morning, I found a mouse in a trap which, had had
its whole skull and brains devoured by the survivors. Mice that
would do this would not hesitate to devour young birds in the
nest, and even small adults in sleeping shelters. I have no rats
here, nor any but the common house mouse, Mus musculus.

CATCHING BIRDS IN THE AVIARY.--The mention
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999017674418605" page_id="10098701"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
of traps leads us on to another thought, which it is to be
hoped may prove the last, at any rate for the present. As most
of us know, it is sometimes necessary to catch birds in the
aviary ; and the larger the aviary the more important it is that
the work should be carried out with our brains and not by means
of the unscientific and dangerous net. In olden days, I used the
net almost as a matter of course ; but I cannot too strongly
condemn this the most usual custom. Of course one must and
should use the net sometimes, but not as a general practice. Mr.
Wiener I am glad to see (p. 59) does not favour the net. His
plan of bringing the wanted bird down with the garden syringe is
excellent when only a stray bird is required ; but it would not
work well in a garden full of birds of many kinds when a number
is required, as is the case here every autumn when a few dozens
have to be transferred to their winter quarters. For some
years now I have used traps, much after the manner described
(Vol. VI., p. 75) by Miss Alderson, and with most satisfactory
results. I now rarely use any trap but those which act only when
I desire ; and more and more I have been discarding the very
large ones in favour of those which can be carried bodily into the
house with their prisoners, and readily carried back again and
reset. Sometimes I use one which works on the principle
described by Miss Alderson ; but I find that a modification of the
sieve trap of our boyhood is by far the best in every way, being
simple, handy, and easily made by oneself in some ten minutes.
Take a piece of wire netting, of suitable mesh of course, some
two feet square (it need not be square, but is best when nearly
so), fold down the four edges to the width of about six inches,
making a cut at each corner to enable the fold to be effected,
interlace at each corner, and there you have in a minute a
rectangular cover of netting which, falling over a bird, would
make it a secure prisoner. Another piece of netting, fastened to
a slight frame to enable the whole to be carried into the
house, should be placed under the trap, and covered with sand
and seed or other food. When the whole affair is lifted, the sand,
seed, etc., slip through the wire and are left behind. Take a
piece of dead, natural looking, stick about six inches long, with
which prop up the side of the cover nearest to where you propose
stationing yourself, which should be out of the sight of the birds
if possible. If the ground be soft, place a stone under the end
of the stick to prevent it sinking into the ground. Fasten a piece
of thin dirty old string (but not rotten) to the lower end of the
stick, and carry the string moderately taut to your hiding-

place. The trap should be set firmly, so that it may not fall
down except at your desire, and may be left for days until the
birds regularly resort to it for their ordinary food. When you
mean business, sprinkle fresh food in the trap or traps (I usually
have at least two), and retire. When you see a goodly number
of the birds you want zvell under the uplifted " sieve " or sieves
(for at first great numbers will go in), pull the string or strings
sharply and the birds are entrapped. Lay a piece of dark baize
or cloth over each trap, to stop the prisoners from fluttering
about, and then carry each trap bodily away. I may finish
up by adding that, when you want to catch a bird in a
cage with your hand, the plan of darkening the cage by placing
something over it is very helpful. The bird in the dark will
crouch down in a corner, and you can lay your hand on it and
catch it without a flutter.
AVICULTURAL NOTES.
By Miss Hodgson.
I have had an Orange Bishop ( P . franciscanus) in my
possession for 12 years, and this winter he has remained in full
colour, though perhaps the orange is less vivid than it was in the
summer. Hitherto he has always assumed the coloured plumage
in July and lost it in November as the days became dark and
foggy. We have not enjoyed much sunshine during the past
winter, and early spring and November and December were
exceptionally foggy here in Kent, so it is curious the bird should
have preserved his brilliancy. My Napoleon Bishop (P.
melanogaster), which I have had for about the same number of
years, is in his usual brown winter dress. The birds are always
fed in the same way and no change has been made in their mode
of living. I believe some authorities say that the American
Nonpareil (Fringilla ciris ), goes "out of colour" in the winter.
Mine moulted every feather in September, and has emerged from
the moult in the most vivid and lovely plumage. I have not
been so fortunate with Gouldians as Mr. Wiener and find them
the most delicate birds I have ever kept. In fact, I am now
trying to harden my heart against the temptation of their beauty
and to abjure the species. They go on well during winter
spring and autumn, but the excessive heat of the last two
summers has invariably proved fatal, and each year I have lost
my five or six lovely specimens in as many days. They mope
for a day or two and then conies the end for no apparent cause.
I have fed them most carefully with plenty of millet in the ear

and flowering grass (never given in a wet state) and Mr.
Abrahams' seed mixture. They are not exposed to the sun
after the early morning, when they have their bath. Afterwards
my aviary cage is kept in a large cool drawing room with sun-
blinds down when necessary. I fancy two of my deceased birds
came from the same place where Mr. Wiener procured his stock.
I do not consider myself unlucky with birds as a rule, and am
able to keep the small rarer species of Waxbills successfully, and
also Tanagers, Zosterops and Sugar Birds. I have had a hen
Daciiis cayana for over two years in perfect condition. The only
drawback to the Tanagers (of which I have three, Scarlet,
Green-headed, and Blue-and-Black) is their occasional spiteful
fits. The late Mr. Abrahams told me this would occur at the
breeding season, and except with the Superb Tanagers, I find
that their peaceable disposition returns after a few weeks.
During their quarrelsome phases they drive the other birds about
the cage, but do no actual harm, with the exception of the
Superb Tanager, Calliste fastuosa. One I had slew first a
Lavender Waxbill and then a Masked Grassfinch, after having
been perfectly peaceable for six months previously. I have found
the Violet Tanagers more delicate than the others. It is curious
how the Shama delights in noise. I have had my bird
" Drosselbart" for nearly seven years and he is a splendid
singer, combining every good quality of a pet bird. I always go
to London for a short time every spring ; " Drosselbart" accom-
panies me and sings from morning till night. He revels in the
various street noises and especially loves to reply to a boy
whistling. The country seems now to strike him as rather dull,
and he is less disposed to favour me with his music, though he
likes to answer the thrushes in the rhododendron bushes on the
lawn.
THE ILLUSTRATION.
We are glad to include in this number a picture of the
Demoiselle Cranes with young one, whose nesting was lately
related by their owner, the Honble. Gerald Lascelles. We
greatly regret to hear that the female has in the meanwhile
fallen a prey to a fox, after living happily in captivity for
years. O. E. C., Editor.

Sir,--A short time ago one of our members wrote to me asking for a
book on Ornamental Waterfowl. I replied referring him to Mr. Finn's
articles in the " Feathered World." It may, however, be of interest to our
members generally to know that the articles by Mr. Finn are reprinted,
and may be had in book form, under the title "F&apos;ancy Waterfowl."

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998394710526316" page_id="10098704"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have read with very great interest Mr. R. Phillipps' notes in
the " Avicultural Magazine" (February, p. 77) on a great favourite of mine,
the Black-headed Sibia (Malarias capistrata). Having observed the species in
a wild state--it is almost the most conspicuous bird at Darjeeling -- I can
bear witness to the accuracy of his observations. But I have here to com-
plain of his objections to its name, and to those of other birds which have
not descriptive English appellations. Now I yield to nobody in my admira-
tion for our noble language, the more so as I am by early training a
classical man, although I have always been a bird-lover, and of late years a
professional naturalist.
Thus I do not like the pseudo-classical barbarisms with which
scientific ornithological literature is loaded, although one must use them
for the sake of accuracy of reference. And still less do I like the refusal to
enrich the English tongue by the adoption of foreign words--for how
otherwise is the language to grow ? Of course one can use descriptive
vernacular names -- which, by the way, not everyone is competent to
frame--but that is a clumsy way out of the difficulty, more suited to the
German language than to the English. But the English way of dealing
with a foreign bird has commonly been to adopt its native name, and I
must say I think with excellent results, granted that people don't know
what is meant at first; let them know that the name given is what the
bird is called in its own country by its own human fellow-countrymen, and
if it is worth noticing at all they will take to the outlandish name readily
enough, if it be at all euphonious and possible of pronunciation.
This is not mere theory. Who would change the names of the
Dhyal and Shama, the Budgerigar and Lory, the Cockatoo and Cassowarv ?
These names meant nothing at first, but people have now got used to them,
more or less, according to the commonness of the birds in question. True
you may call a Budgerigar an "Undulated Grass Parrakeet," but you will
not find many people to follow you ; the name is too long for an essentially
practical language like ours.
Now as to the Sibia; Sibya is the name given to the bird by the
Nepalese, who know it as a native. It is not an ugly name, nor hard to
say; and as the bird represents a very distinct and recognizable genus, it
has surely a right to a name of its own. A Sibia is a .Sibia, and there is an
end of the matter; you can call it a Black-headed Tree-babbler if you like
a descriptive name, but I would lay long odds on the real name winning in
the long run.

The case of the Strutliidea is different; Struthidea is not a native
name, but one of those doggy Greek abominations which ornithologists
delight in, and therefore a name wdiicli is only known to a comparatively
small number of specialists, never having formed part of the vernacular
of any people. Were it possible to call the bird something else I should
much like to do so ; but what can you call it ? There is no bird I know of
near enough to the Struthidea to share names with it. I don't happen to
know what the natives and the colonials call it, but if their name is at all
11 possible" it should, I think, be adopted (a). A colonial name may not be
correct, but it always expresses something, like a dealer's or schoolboy's.
The Pekin Robin doesn't come from Pekin, and isn't a Robin; but he looks
like one, and is found in China. Whereas his scientific title of Liothrix
means simply " smooth hair," which is, I submit, merelj 7 silly--though I
must plead guilty to often using it, because it is rather a pretty word, and
a handy one.
The " descriptive name " naturalists give to this bird is the Red-
billed Hill-Tit. But the bird is not a Tit, but a small Babbler, and there are
plenty of real Tits in the Indian hills which form part of his wide range.
The native names are Nanachura and Rapchil-pho ; these, I submit, are not
pretty or easy to say, and so in this case I think the dealer and the producer
of modern scientific terms have a fair case against these particular speci-
mens. The best argument I know in favour of the adoption of native
names is the readiness of the outside public-- i.e., 11011-birdy people, whom
we all want to help--to adopt them. I know several New Zealanders in
Calcutta, and I notice they all rise Maori names in speaking of their native
birds, so that I take it these are well-rooted among English people in that
colony. So, in India, most people who use their eyes, know the black
Cuckoo as the Koel, and call the Bulbul and Mynah by the same names as
are used by the natives.
I have, I fear, written at what will seem to most of our members
needless length on this subject. But I admire a fine language as well as a
fine bird, and I should be sorry to see ours defaced, when it deals with
aviculture--I W&apos;ould rather say bird-fancying, but I daren't here--by uu-
wieldly Teutonic compounds, or by the appalling productious of naturalists
who know 7 , in most cases, as little of the classical languages as they do of
live birds. Frank Finn.

Sir, -- I have a male Red-faced Finch in a large flight cage with about
fifteen other birds. He has been very bald on his back all the winter, and
even now the feathers are not coming in. I took him out of the cage to
see if I could do anything for him as I noticed one of the Zebra-finches
pecking his back. It is swollen and very hot to touch and looks inflamed.
I painted it with a little sw&apos;eet oil, but should be glad if you can give me
any advice on the subject. The bird is quite well otherwise and in good
spirits, and I am most anxious to get him right, as he is a dear little bird
and very tame, and, of course, he is one of the best birds I have.
I feed all my birds on white millet and canary seed, brown millet and

adds that it is more frequently called the "Apostle Bird."--R. P.

spray millet. They have plenty of sand (Hyde's shell gravel), egg shells
crushed, cuttle fish bone and green food. One or two of them have taken a
long time to get through the moult, but I have never had one lose all the
feathers on the back like this.
I shall be very much obliged if you can help me. I gave him
Parrish's food in the water, and have now put him bv himself in a cage so
that the others cannot annoy him. I am also trying to get some sea sand
for my birds as, perhaps, the)&apos; require a change; but all the others, with
the exception of one Spice-bird, are in very good feather.
I hope some of the members of the Society may be able to tell me
what I should do. I do not know the age of my Red-faced Finch, but I
bought him in Madeira three years ago, and he has never had anything
wrong until this winter. E. W. Robertson.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Robe/ tson:
The drawback to keeping the Ornamental Finches together in a
cage is that they almost always peck one another's feathers out. I think it
highly probable that the Red-faced Finch has suffered simply from the lack
of other occupation on the part of the Zebra-finch.
Should lie not recover his feathers when isolated, you will have to
treat him for ' Surfeit ' so-called, with four grains of Epsom salts and the
same quantity of chlorate of potash in his drinking water for one day, but
I do not think he will require this.
I prefer vaseline to sweet oil; it does not run into the feathers and
disfigure the bird to the same extent.
Shell-sand is dangerous, on account of the sharp-edged chips of
shell, which are apt to perforate the crop and so cause death : you will do
well to use sea-sand. Uo not wash the sand, as the salt in it is most bene-
ficial to all birds. A. G. BuTEER.

Sir, --The article in last month's Magazine on "Intelligent Pets"
was, in my opinion, most interesting, as no doubt nearly ever) - member has
his favourites. Among my birds the Grey Parrot holds premier position.
It is a most accomplished talker, and values itself by repeating "Fifty
pounds for pretty Polly." When I purchased this bird three years ago I
was told it had been fed on "sop," and that its breast was bare because it
was moulting. I knew better, however, ami now that it gets no sop it is
in splendid plumage. Among the "smaller fry" our greatest pet is a
Sliama, which spends a great deal of its time out of the cage, and is so
tame that it will readily fly and take mealworms from our fingers. It is
very jealous of a Blue Robin which also feeds from our hands. The Sliama
I consider a most interesting cage bird and I should be sorry to be without
one. Why is it that hen Shamas are so rarely advertized?
I trust that some of the wealthier members of the Society will favour
us with photos and descriptions of their aviaries, as 1 am sure these articles

THE SATIN BOWER-BIRD.

Sir, --I note in issue of Magazine just to hand (p. 123) Mr. Phillipps
says: "I am surprised that Mr. Page should give the height of the Satin-
birds'bower as 12 inches." In my article (p. 69) I stated clearly that most
of the information it contained was culled from an article by Mr. A. J.
Campbell, of Melbourne, in " Bird Lore," October issue, 1900, so that it is
not really I that give the height as 12 inches but Mr. A. J. Campbell. I
will now quote the passage in extenso : "The curious play house, or lovers'
arbour is built uoon the ground. It has apparently no connection with
the nests, which may be any distance away. One of these bowers I collected
in Xmas.-tide 1884. It was situated amongst bracken in open forest.
There was a cleared circular space about 26 inches across, in the ferns,
floored with twigs well trodden down. I11 the centre were erected two
parallel walls of pliable twigs, tapering and arching towards the top, which
was 12 inches in height. The walls were about 10 inches long and 6 inches
apart. In the avenue and round about were placed gay feathers of
Parrots."
It would appear from Mr. Phillipps' experience that the Satin Bower-
bird, in a state of nature, frequently changes the site of bower, or else,
being at full liberty, it is otherwise engaged than in continuous building.
For it would appear from Mr. Phillipps' facts that, even in a large aviary,
they get hold of all the available material and go on building in the same
place (I presume from lack of choice) till ultimately a huge structure is
raised; which is not customary in their native haunts. If this is so, it
points to the necessity of the aviculturist comparing his data with those
of the field naturalist, to arrive at a correct conclusion.
I myself am convinced that the birds we keep, even in large outdoor
aviaries, vary considerably in their habits and demeanour under such con-
ditions from what they do when in full liberty. Though at the same time, as
we know from experience, that valuable knowledge has been gained by the
aviculturist,especially concerning song, method of courting, moulting, nidifi-
cation, &amp;c. For myself, I am sure that if a pair of Satin Bower-birds had an
enclosure of sufficient size, they would construct a bower similar to that
described by Mr. Campbell, and that given a plenitude of material, they
would choose the shorter in lieu of the " 2--3 foot poplar rod," which given
plenty of choice is probably the last they would choose.
Wesley T. Page.
P.s. --If Mr. Phillipps would care to have a look at the illustrations
and peruse Mr. Campbell's article I shall be pleased to post it on to him--
he can return same at his convenience, as I have only one copy ( b).
W. T. P.
(&lt;$.) I am very much obliged, but I now have Mr. A. J. Campbell's excellent book.--R.P.

THE SHAMA.
By E. W. Harper, M.B.O.U., F.Z.S.
The Shama is found generally throughout the greater
part of India, from the base of the Himalayas to Ceylon; it
also extends to Burmah. Its home is in the dense jungles, away
from the haunts of men. The Dayal, on the other hand, which
is first cousin to the Shama, even at times courts human society;
a pair of these birds has taken up its abode in a garden in the
centre of Calcutta, and I have seen the cock bird approach to
within six yards of the house. The Shama lays four eggs in a
nest composed of dry grass and leaves, generally in a bank or
hole of a tree near the ground. Although shy and retiring in
its habits, it has the pluck of a game Bantam cock. A hen
Shama, which is now in my possession, quickly asserted her
authority over a cock White-capped Redstart and a cock Niltava
Flycatcher, which were in the same aviary. Even larger birds,
such as Orioles, have to keep their distance, owing to the
pugilistic attitude of the lady Shama, when a dainty morsel of
food is offered ; for she opens her long tail like a fan and spreads
her wings forward and downward in a most threatening
manner.
Shamas are caught wild and also reared by hand in fairly
large numbers, but I never heard of their having been bred in
captivity in India; although Mr. Pliillipps has done so in
England. This is chiefly owing to the fact that there are so few
aviculturists in India. Amongst Europeans, I doubt if there
are a dozen enthusiastic aviculturists in the whole peninsula.
Natives would not take the necessary trouble ; especially when
young birds can be purchased for three shillings or four shillings
each in the towns, and probably much less up-country. The
hen Shama is rarely seen in captivity ; but her lord and master
is one of the most favourite cage-birds amongst the natives. He
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999240953488372" page_id="10098709"  page_num="150" year="" vol="">
ranks with the Greater Racket-tailed Drongo as being the finest
songster in the East.
The Shama has a "regulation" cage in India---just as
Larks, Thrushes, and Linnets have in England. It is shaped
like a gipsy's waggon ; round at the top, and entirely open--top,
sides, end, and bottom. The bars are of cane, wire, or brass;
according to the pocket of the owner. There is no false bottom ;
a piece of cloth being placed upon the floor of the cage, which
is scraped occasionally. The cage is about 18 inches long, 8
inches high, and 8 inches wide, with the door in the middle.
Two perches are placed across the cage, about 2 inches from
the bottom and 3 inches from each end. Food and water
are always put inside the cage, and the whole is wrapped up
tightly in a cotton cloth. The size of the cage and the position
of the perches prevent the poor bird from flicking its magnifi-
cent tail without damaging it.
The cruel practice of covering up the cage night and day
with a cloth is universal amongst natives, without exception.
I have frequently asked a man's reason for doing so, and have
been informed that it is " the custom " ; another man will tell
you that the bird will catch cold, if uncovered ; others say that
the wind will ruffle the bird's feathers and make him look less
sleek. The general belief is that the bird, seeing nothing to
attract its attention, has more leisure for singing. One man,
who tried to be very eloquent, stated that by covering up the
cage the bird sang both day and night! that man was a veritable
Shylock, and demanded his " pound of flesh " even from the
poor Shama.
The size of a Shama's body is about equal to that of an
English Robin ; its tail measures about 6 inches. The colour-
ing of the male bird is well described in Dr. Butler's " Foreign
Bird Keeping," part I. The female has the white rump as in
the male ; but the upper parts of the body which are black in
the male are slaty brown in the female; and the rich chesnut
breast of the male is replaced by a rufous one in the female.
The young of both sexes are brown, spotted with rufous.
Oates, in his "Birds of British India," places the Shama
between the Robins and the Ouzels.
Regarding the food of this bird in captivity, perhaps it
would not be out of place to describe how he fares when his
owner is a native. The staple food is peameal well mixed with
"ghee" (refined butter) to a stiff paste : about a teaspoonful of
live maggots are also given daily, as well as a few grasshoppers ;
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999543255813954" page_id="10098710"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
and drinking water ad libitum. Up-country, where maggots are
not commonly bred, white ants and a little raw lean meat take
their place. That is the sole diet of the Shama, and he thrives
on it. I heard of one bird which lived for 14 years and was then
killed by a rat!
It may be asked, How about the live maggots ? Nothing
is simpler. Here in Calcutta we have the maggot-man, just as
London has its cats'-meat-mau. He comes round every morning,
starting as soon as it is light, with his can of maggots and his
bag of grasshoppers. He charges me Rs.2 (2s. 8d.) per month,
and gives me about four tablespooufuls of live maggots and some
grasshoppers every day. He tells me that he has about 40
houses to visit during his morning round ; so he must make a
fairly good living--considering that the average pay of native
servants is from Rs. 10 to Rs.15 a month. He employs a boy to
catch the grasshoppers and " breed " the maggots. This is done
by putting damp cow-dung mixed with a little blood from the
slaughter-house into a sack, open at the top and hung up. The
contents soon become fly-blown ; and the maggots, working
their way downwards through the sack, fall into an earthenware
vessel placed to receive them. They are cleansed with dry
earth, and finally shaken up with a little peameal to receive their
final " polish." A gallipot for single birds, or a small trough for
an aviary, I have found most convenient for putting the maggots
into ; they never attempt to crawl out unless thejr get wet. The
great advantage of maggots over mealworms is that the former
are produced so quickly; they never get more than half-an-inch
in length, however.
The Shama is "taken out for a walk" every evening after
the heat of the day is over ; that is to say, his owner or his
owner's servant goes for a walk and takes the cage containing
the bird--always covered--with him. It is quite a common
sight to see a man carrying very carefully a cage in each hand ;
the little occupants frequently bursting into song. My ex-
perience is that you get more genuine singing in a pleasant
subdued tone from a Shama when his cage is never covered up;
on the other hand, I think the bird does more " loud shouting,"
though at much less frequent intervals, when the cage is always
covered.
Shamas get extremely attached to anyone who feeds them.
The hen bird, to which I have already referred, delights in being
talked to. She comes close to the wires of her aviary and, if
caressed by the voice, puffs out her feathers and sings with all

her might ; her large gazelle-like eyes seeming to dance with
delight. I am not exaggerating about the eyes ; anyone who
has kept this species must have noticed their size, which quite
equals those of a Starling--a very much bigger bird.
In an aviary of decent size the Shama always remains on
or near the ground during the day ; often taking a darting flight
into the air, accompanied by a click of the voice and a sudden
spreading of the tail; at night it naturally roosts upon a perch.
Moths, butterflies, grasshoppers, worms, beetles, cock-
roaches, spiders, flies, and bits of raw lean meat are amongst the
dainties that tickle a Shama's palate.
The dealers in Calcutta tell me that most of the exported
Shatnas go to Germany ; some enterprising individuals bringing
mealworms all the way to India from the Fatherland, for use on
the voyage.

AVICULTURE.
By Wesley T. Page, F.Z.S.
"Can much be done with only one aviary?" is a question
frequently asked. I answer most decidedly, yes. But in the
first place the aviculturist must decide as to the course he intends
to pursue. If breeding is to be his paramount aim, then he
must content himself with small numbers and variety; say six,
or at most, seven pairs of birds, in an aviary of say 20ft. long,
3ft. to 4ft. wide, and 6ft. to 8ft. high. But even thus the young
must be disposed of as tliey^ assume adult plumage--or a second
aviary of equal size, kept merely as a flight, erected for their
accommodation--otherwise they will upset their parents' breed-
ing arrangements, in fact almost nullify them.
O11 the other hand, if the aviculturist decides on number
and variety, then he can have in the same space 50 or 60 birds.
But while he will gather a lot of useful general information, his
breeding experiences will be few and far between, though under
such conditions I have reared numbers of Zebra and Ribbon
Finches, Java Sparrows, Cockatiels, and similar common stuff,
with interest and pleasure, if not profit ; but that is a minor
matter with the earnest aviculturist; he is athirst for knowledge
and counts not the cost of anything within his means. Now as
to variety, what may we keep together ? What I am about to
say, I am afraid many of our members will consider very
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.980175642857143" page_id="10098712"  page_num="153" year="" vol="">
unorthodox, if not rank heresy ; be that as it may, I am simply
stating what I have done ( &apos; experientia docct ) and am still doing.
If others will adopt the same precautions, they will succeed in
the same, and possibly greater measure. Now for the birds I
have kept, and still keep together in the same enclosure.
Waxbills in variety including the small N porceginthus
subftavics, a fairly representative series of Mannikins, Grass-
finches, Grey Java Sparrows, a few Buntings, and a pair of
Cockatiels.
Methods of procedure. Do not get some of all the above,
and loose them into your aviary straight away ; this would
simply invite disaster. Get first some Waxbills, and let them
have tlxe aviary to themselves for a mouth, by that time they will
know their way about and take care of themselves.
Next introduce a pair or two of Grassfinches, watching
carefully those of larger size till their demeanour is ascertained.
Mannikins may follow; these are generally quite harmless,
excepting the Magpie Mannikin (Amauresthes fringilloid.es),
which had better be left out, unless the enclosure be very large ;
for although he seldom does much harm, in the event of a
quarrel, a blow from his powerful beak would be fatal, even to
a bird fully his own size.
Saffron Finches must be introduced with caution, care-
fully watched, and at once removed if they become at all
combative ; and only one pair must be kept. But in spite of the
evil reputation they enjoy, I have had a very amiable pair for
several years, which have never done any mischief ; I have only
the cock now; the hen died last summer while I was ill, egg
bound for want of lime-rubbish I suspect. Your birds fare but
poorly as a rule when you cannot attend to them yourself.
The same care must be exercised as to&apos;Weavers; and as
they scarcely ever attempt to breed, though they build numbers
of their interesting and cleverly woven nests, it is as well to
limit the supply to one or two cocks ; for instance, the Orange,
Madagascar and Red-billed species.
The Cockatiels should be introduced the second year;
then they seldom do any mischief; mine have never done any.
Green Singing Finches and Pekin Robins are inveterate
egg eaters, unless the aviary be very large ; otherwise they are
handsome and charming birds.
Now I can almost hear someone saying, " What about
tragedies?'' Well, I have never had any, not a single death

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.999421744186047" page_id="10098713"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
which I could attribute to violence, excepting when I first turned
the Cockatiels in. No sooner had the larger Finches got over
the scare caused by the introduction of large birds into their
midst, than they set to work to mob them ; and a Saffron Finch
and a Greenfinch were mortally wounded in the scrimmage. The
next day there was a declaration of peace, which has not been
broken since, though four years have run their course.
Favourites.--Well, I suppose we ought not to have any as
aviculturists ; however this may be, there are some that by their
artless and confiding ways insinuate themselves into a first place
in our affections. At the head of these, with me stand the
beautiful little Zebra Waxbills with their taking ways, funny
little love dance, fearless, happy and confiding demeanour under
all circumstances ; these, coupled with their extreme hardiness
and longevity, give them the first place.
Silverbills.--These are very entertaining birds, of quiet,
dainty appearance, having a soft, sweet running sort of song ;
the quaint, ridiculous (from our standpoint) courting of the male,
coupled with their trustful and confiding demeanour, cause them,
I think, to win their way with all.
I have been surprised to find these described as exclusive
seed eaters, and as never, or scarcely ever, touching green food.
Mine certainly eat mealworms, gentles, and ants' cocoons, and
also visit the soft food saucer, picking up some dainty tit-bits.
They also regularly eat a little green food, and eagerly search it
over for aphides, of which they appear to be very fond. This
causes me to infer that, in common with all other Finches, they
largely rear their young on insect food ; they have never,
however, bred in my aviary (too much company). While
speaking in general : Waxbills, for obvious reasons, most readily
win their way with us. I must confess to a strong liking (some
will perhaps think it depraved) for Mannikins. In a fair sized
aviary I find them active, entertaining and full of interest with
their quaint ways. The impudent, cheeky, self-assertive little
Zebra Finch, so active in blowing his own little trumpet, is a
favourite everywhere.
There are many birds which, while lacking the seductive
traits of those particularized above, command a place in our
collections by reason of their rarity and little known habits,
striking and handsome plumage, or diversity between winter
and summer dress. I will name a few, not going over a long
list, but keeping in mind the aforesaid outdoor aviary mixed
series.

Indigo Bunting and Nonpareil Bunting.--I have not kept
these two together, but, from one of our members' experience,
should think it possible to do so.
Orange Weaver, Madagascar and Red-billed Weavers.--
The Torquoisine may be kept in lieu of the Cockatiels
if preferred, or a pair of each if the aviary is not less than 30ft.
long.
I have not yet kept either Parrot or Gouldian Finches out
of doors. I am convinced that they can be so kept (").
I find I have omitted the beautiful little Chinese Quail.
A pair of these should certainly be kept. They not only give
variety, being ground birds, but practically live 011 the seed the
other birds scatter on the floor; thus they not only charm,
but help to starve out the mice. They also need soft food and a
few insects.
Winter.--This is usually looked upon as a trying time for
the out-door aviary--so it is for the aviculturist attending to
birdy wants in rough weather--but for the birds themselves I do
not find it so; the trying time is damp, wet weather, whether it
occurs during the heat of summer or cold of winter; dry cold
does not hurt or cause inconvenience to the majority of foreign
birds. At least they appear to feel it less than our native
Britishers. The little Zebra Waxbills, during the sharp frosts
and bitter winds of the past month (March), have been the
merriest, happiest little creatures in my aviary, taking their
morning tub as if it were mid-summer, and spending their time
cuddled up in a ball and shivering! Oh dear no ! but on they
go, flitting here and there, chirping and trilling from morn till
night. The Zebra Finch is I know noted for its hardiness: but
one little fellow this year began to moult early in March last,
and he has come triumphantly through it, and is now (April
3rd) as saucy and impudent as it is possible for a Zebra Finch to
be. This might have passed my notice, for these cold wet days
I have done little but just give them their necessary food and
away again ; but one of my sisters told me one of my Zebras
was looking queer, so I went and had a look at him ; he came at
once to one of the front branches, and, though looking out of
sorts, blew his ridiculous little trumpet with all the assurance
and cheek in the world. I saw at once what was the matter, gave
him a piece of egg as a dainty bit, and increased same in soft
food, and now he is A 1 again.
(a.) I reared a brood of five young Gouldian Finches in an exposed outdoor aviary
last November, which speaks well for the hardiness of the species.--D. S.-S.

In looking through 1115^ notes, I find that on many
occasions my birds have eaten the grass, etc., growing in the
aviary, before the sun had removed the frost from it. I suppose
our native birds do the same, for most of their food must be
covered with frost during many of winter's days. I have also
seen my birds partaking of seed that had stood all night in the
aviary and was thickly coated over with frost. I also give my
birds garden green stuff, just as taken, during wet weather, and
it is freely eaten with no harmful result. At the same time such
must not be offered to birds in cages or indoor bird-rooms.
Moulting and change of plumage.--At this period I always
increase insect food. All Finches, aye, and Waxbills too, seem
glad of it at this time ; and I am convinced the lustre of their
plumage is added to by its use.
As regards Avadavats, I have nothing further to add to
what I have already stated in the Magazine. Their time of moult
and assumption of court dress have been as hitherto. I may say,
in passing, that my first pair have now spent six winters out of
doors, and are still in perfect health and trim.
My Indigo Bunting I have had with me but two winters;
its time of moult and coming into colour, are about the same as
that of our native Chaffinch. It is now (April 3rd) just come
into full colour, and is a perfect picture. When out of colour
there is a good bit of dull blue about the upp^r parts, and also
subdued patches underneath. I cannot discover that any
feathers are shed during the change from winter to breeding
plumage.
Re Red-billed Orange and Madagascar Weavers.-- As
regards all three, I am forced to the conclusion, after four years
of close observation, that in the parts affected by the change,
from winter to breeding plumage, the whole of the feathers are shed,
and the change is thus brought about and not by a growth of
colour in the plumage. I have handled the birds during the
change, and have seen for myself the pin feathers, and some
further advanced with the sheath burst and the brighter coloured
feathers shewing ; have also observed them at these times
pulling out their feathers as they do at the ordinary moulting
time. In fact their demeanour on both occasions is practically the
same, the feathers shed may be picked up about the aviary ( b ).
(6). Most of the Weavers moult the feathers of the crown, nape, upper and lower
tail coverts, and posterior flauk-feathers, during- the change to the summer dress. The
Indigo Bunting certainly moults the crown feathers, for I had a dead one sent to me
recently showing the new feathers coming on the crown ; but, on other parts of the body,
some of the feathers were particoloured, and some faintly washed with blue. I gave
the specimen to the Nat. Hist. Museum.--A. G. B.

When I first got my Zebra Waxbills I expected them to
go out of colour in the winter, but I find this is not so. The
only difference is that after the autumn moult the breast lacks
the rich orange tint of breeding plumage; just now they are
almost in full court dress.
I may say that, in my aviary, although the nest boxes only
get an annual clean, red mite (the curse of indoor aviaries and
cages) is unknown.
On a second lookilig through my note book, I find an
entry, re the Chinese Quail, to the effect that these pretty little
birds seem semi-nocturnal in their habits. They certainly sleep
during the heat of our summer afternoons, and are very active
during the twilight of our summer evenings, and I also think
during part of the night, for when I have gone, as I mostly do
during summer, down the garden the last thing to have a look
round, I have on many occasions seen them scuttling off to their
shelter (a square patch of sand, raised 6in. above floor level with
a sloping board over it, leaving only the front open) at 12.0
midnight.
I hope that in this rambling avicultural chat there will be
some items of interest.
THE ZOSTEROPS.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Years ago, I remember that Zosterops were amongst the
rarest of the rare ; of late years they have been more plentiful.
I know of few birds more beautiful in a quiet way than these
pretty little things, and they have the merit of hardiness. That
no one need be anxious about the Zosterops on the score of cold
or climatic changes is pretty evident, when I say that all this
last winter I have had some of these out of doors in a perfectly
unheated aviary in Yorkshire. A friend was over one morning,
and he would hardly believe that I really had them out until I
shewed them to him, spry and active. " Well," he said, " I
should have thought the first slight frost would have finished
them off."
I am very fond of my little spectacled friends, and
generally succumb when I am offered any by the dealers. Not
long since, I got a letter one morning offering Zosterops at a
reasonable rate. I wired that I would have a pair if in good
condition. I say this because usually Zosterops come over
nearly naked. For some reason or other, overcrowding most

<bodyText confidence="0.999056619047619" page_id="10098717"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
likely, they take to feather plucking on the voyage, and when
they arrive in dock all are minus their feathers but perhaps one
or two. The dealer said he had one pair ' fair,' the rest in the
usual condition. I wired off--"How many are there?" The
reply soon came flashing over the wires--"There are six more
bally Zosterops." I replied--" Send the six bally Zosterops,"
and the next morning they came to hand. A more ragged
regiment I never saw. They had hardly a feather among them ;
just head, flight, and tail, the rest naked body! Poor little
beggars, how they did shiver! I put them each into a nice
clean cage, gave them half an orange, and a good bath. How
they did enjoy themselves to be sure. They soon began to
mend, and after about six weeks' solitary confinement, each in his
little cage apart, they came into the most perfect feather, and I
only wished my dealer friend could have seen his poor'bally*
scarecrows; but then, how the price would have gone up by
leaps and bounds !
Zosterops are very affectionate little things, and always go
off in pairs as far as they will go.
I think I have seen it said somewhere that Zosterops have
no song. This is a great mistake. The cock Zosterops has a
most beautiful song, almost equal to the English Blackcap. The
first time I heard one open out, I wondered what bird it was.
A pair of Zosterops would be simply invaluable in a
greenhouse, as they revel in green fly, that pest of the flower
grower, and they would do no harm to the most tender plants;
but then conservatory owners are such unreasonable beings!
I feed my Zosterops on my home made soft mixture, and
half an orange a-day. They are intensely fond of bathing, and
get so wet that they can only stagger about the cage for quite a
long time after. They are very active little mites, and creep in
and out among the shrubs, and hang head downwards like our
English Tits ; and it must be a wily gnat indeed that can escape
their sharp little eyes.
I may say, for the sake of the unlearned and ignorant,,
that ' Zosterops' means ' girdled eyes'; hence the name Spectacle
birds.
My ambition is to breed the Zosterops ; the only thing I
wonder about is, on what they feed their young ? I think it
must be minute insects like aphides and gnats. They are very
fond of stewed apple well sweetened with sugar. They do
not care for insects of the mealworm order.

As it grows dusk you can hear quite a chorus of anxious
calls and twitterings, until eacli little partner cuddles up to its
mate and settles down for the night.
I have had two sorts of Zosterops--the Chinese and the
Australian ; the latter is a little larger than his Chinese brother
and more brown.
The young birds can be told by their very greenerv-
yallery heads ; when adult they are beautiful mossy-green. I
should think that Zosterops must be capital show birds, as they
are so tame and familiar, and none can make them afraid.
Death, when it comes to these little birds, usually comes
suddenly in the form of a fit. I sometimes find one dead on the
floor, a perfect ball of fat and every feather perfect.
They are wonderfully cute little things and soon know me
by sight, and hardly wait for me to put the stewed apple in their
pot before they are down--putting it away as fast as they can,
and vigorously scolding any other unfortunate bird that dares
to approach their dainty. Of course this scolding is all bunkum--
for they couldn't hurt a good healthy bluebottle fly.
When flying about the enclosure they always keep in
touch with each other by their call-note; and there is quite a
commotion if one gets lost for a minute in some bush or fails to
answer when time is called !
To anyone who desires a tame, hardy, engaging little
couple, I would say, give Zosterops a trial.
CORRESPONDENCE.
EAGLE OWLS.
Sir,--I n reply to the query of how to distinguish the sexes of Eagle
Owls otherwise than by size, I can inform Mr. Leigh that the voices of the
two sexes are entirely different: the call of the cock being a single deep
' boo,' that of the hen a triple note--' lio-ho-ho,' and uttered in a higher
pitch. Also the wings of the cock reach nearer to the end of the tail when
folded than do those of the hen ; this will be noticed in all the Owls that
are short-winged, and in most of the raptores. I do not think that Eagle
Owls ever lay their first season, but I have known several instances of their
breeding when two years old. And again, some do not breed for five or six

NESTING OF GREEN-WINGED DOVES.
Sir, --Though many of our members seem to keep the Indian Green-
winged Pigeon, I have seen no note on the nesting of these birds.

In September, 1899, my Green-wings first showed signs of pairing.
The cock would frequently coo to and caress his mate. While courting he
depressed the head and breast, raising the closed wings over his back, thus
presenting the whole of his glittering green plumage to his lady love.
The pair soon took possession of an old Turtle Dove's liest in a birch
branch, carrying in a few twigs, but before any eggs were laid the cock was
unfortunately killed by a cat.
I soon procured another mate for the hen, and last September she
again seemed anxious to nest. The cock, however, though friendly, took
little interest in her proceedings. No nest was made, but two very small,
round eggs were laid in a basket lid. She commenced to sit, but seeing
that the eggs were useless, I broke them and found them to be yolkless.
About a fortnight later two more eggs were dropped from a perch.
So far as I could judge these were normal.
As the enclosure in which these birds are kept is not sparrow-proof,
their food consists almost entirely of maize. Would this account for im-
perfect eggs? The birds seem to be in excellent condition.

NOTE RE BLACK-TAILED GODWIT.
Sir,--E ast Spring I received several Black-tailed Godwits, all of
which arrived with their wings cut, and towards the end of November it
became evident that they were not getting through their moult ; besides
being dirt} - , with their feathers all glued together, their feet had large
lumps of dirt adhering to them which accumulated again and again almost
as fast as it was removed, and this was not due to the ground of their
aviary, which was made of fresh turf and shingle, being dirty.
About Christmas-time, being reminded in an article I read that birds
with cut or broken quills were often unable to cast them in the moult, I
caught them up and removed the stumps from three of them, leaving them
on a fourth individual who had succeeded in moulting the first two primar-
ies. They were then removed from their outdoor quarters and placed in an
indoor (but unheated) aviary, having the floor thickly covered with sawdust.
One of them died almost immediately, and of the others, those whose
stumps I had removed are now once more in perfect health and plumage;
while the third, whose primaries had not been drawn, is still in the same
state of dirty feathers and clogged up feet, although it has been kept under
precisely the same conditions.
I have ventured to write this note as, while it is fairly generally&apos;
known that to remove the primaries and place the bird in a warm place is
often efficacious in backward moult, yet it is worth while noting its far-
reaching effects, as general slovenliness and dirty feet are not usually
associated with moult. J. Lewis Bonhote.
THE REGENT-BIRD ; SKINS OF DEAD BIRDS.
Sir, --Permit me to thank Mr. Phillipps for bringing me up to date

I did not turn up my copies of Proceedings Zoological Society or I might
have satisfied myself there.

I did not succeed in getting to the Crystal Palace Show until Satur-
day afternoon, and I do not think the bird could have been on exhibit at
the time I looked round. I find it hard to believe that I could have over-
looked so noticeable and comparatively rare an exhibit. Will i\Ir. Phillipps
kindly say if it was in full colour ? (c)
If any of our members at any time lose such foreign birds as Starlings,
Bower-birds, Sliamas, Parrakeets, or the more tender and delicate insec-
tivorous and frugivorous species generally, and they do not require the
skins for themselves, I should be very glad if they would post them on
to me, and I would thankfully acknowledge the same, with cost of postage.

Sir,--I have a pair of Pytelia afra sitting on either two or three eggs,
and should be much obliged if any of the contributors to the " Avicultural
Magazine " could tell me what I should do about food for the young birds,
should the parents be successful in hatching them out. The birds have
been sitting for a week, and one of them is always in the nest; they take it
in turns, and are sitting very well. Their nest is in a small basket tied
inside their cage. I have had the male bird for three years, but only got
the hen on the 20th March this year.
I should also be glad to know if the Pytelia afra has ever been bred in
this country.
I feed them on canary, millet, spray millet, and green food ; but
perhaps the young birds may require soft food if they hatch out. I am not
sure how long the period of incubation is, and should be glad to know.
E. W. Robertson.
The following reply has been sent to Airs. Robe/ tson :
You should certainly give the birds daily, in addition to their seed, a
small pan of soft food : -- two parts crushed sweet biscuit to one part yolk of
egg, and one part of ants' eggs, moistened; if you could get fresh ants'
eggs it would be better; if not I would recommend you to put a few
small mealworms in for them daily.
I cannot discover that the Red-faced Finch has ever been bred,
although Mr. Hawkins had a hen which deposited several eggs on the
floor of its cage. A. G. BUTEER.

I studied most carefully the question of bald birds, and I never found

(c) Yes; but it was not pat ticularly noticeable, cooped up in a cage. The laxity of
the Show officials in allowing rare birds to be carried away in order that they may be

Sir,--I should be glad if you or any of your readers could tell me
(I) What weight of meat or liver per diem a full grown Tawny Owl requires
to keep in good health ? (2) How long their eggs take to hatch ? (3) At
what age are the young able to feed themselves ? (4) Do they commence
nesting as early as the beginning of April ? I think mine must have

closely for fear that they might desert. Chas. Cushny.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Cushny :
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.97938425" page_id="10098721"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
(1) The amount of meat for a full grown Tawny Owl would be about
one-tliird the size of a rat or a little over, supposing it to be all lean.
Young birds after the first moult would require as much, if not more. I
generally fast all my Owls once a week, but it w&apos;ould not be advisable to do
so if they were nesting. They require some fur in the shape of rats or
fowls' heads frequently, and the more freshly killed the better.
(2) The duration of incubation is, I believe, a little over three weeks.
(3) The young are able to feed themselves at about a mouth or five
weeks old; but in a wild state they are fed by the parents for over two
months, as they are unable to capture their own food.
(4) They are one of the earliest English birds to nest, eggs being
frequently found in March. J. Lewis BonhoTE.

Sir,-- In my little sketch of the Black-headed Sibia, I made a state-
ment respecting the species which has not been confirmed by my further
experiences of the bird, and which I shall be obliged if you will kindly
give me an opportunity of modifying. At the top of page 77 of the
current volume, I said, "they mainly rely on their spring for taking their
prey, never flying like a Flycatcher." This year my Sibias, although not
taking their prey quite in the orthodox P&apos;lycatcher fashion, will fly any
distance that their aviary will permit after winged inserts, and evidently
prefer this form of food to any which it is in my power to supply.
I cordially thank Mr. Finn for the information he gives us (p. 145)
about this attractive species, and agree with most of what he says. Never-
theless, taking as an instance a bird to which he refers, one in which I take
much interest and a pair of which I have kept, it must be admitted that
the word " Koel " conveys absolutely no meaning whatever to the majority
of English readers, whilst the name " Cuckoo" awakens some glimmer of
intelligence in the mind of even the densest Britisher. Why, the late Mr.
Abrahams was unacquainted with the name " Koel," when I applied it a
few years ago to a male " Indian Cuckoo " which he had in his shop !
A new bird has somewhat recently arrived in this country, common
\0x25A0enough in India I suppose, but hitherto unknown to us poor stay-at-home
bodies. I refer to the Rufous-chiuned Laugliing-Thrusli. Now this is as
unwieldy a name as " Black-headed Tree-babbler," but it gives us an idea
of the bird and of the species, whereas " Rufous-chinned Trochalopterum "
or "Rufous-chinned Ianthocincla " would be a mouthful to swallow all at

once, and could hardly be called an improvement. Possibly there may be
some suitable native name with which we are not acquainted.
The title " Rufous-chinned Laughing-Thrush " I have taken from
the London Zoological Society's Report lor 1900; and following this name
I find mentioned the "Western Yellow-winged Laughing-Thrush" and the
"Slaty-headed Scimitar Babbler." These truly are dreadful names, but
they convey a certain amount of meaning, and should not be rejected
without good reason.
To return to Trochalopterum rufigulare, the title "Laughing-Thrush"
is a little deceptive if my two birds are fair representatives of the species.
Excepting when handled, the female has so far been mute. The male goes
about chuckling to himself in a scarcely audible tone as he gathers
nesting materials or hunts for insects and seeds, and occasionally utters a
low scolding note; hut he is exceptionally quiet, and never whistles or
sings after the pleasing manner of some of the Laughing-Thrushes; that
is, he never laughs outright, but keeps all his little jokes to himself. The
word "seed " I use tentatively, for I can only say positively that they are
rather fond of oats, which they shell by means of powerful blows with the
bill, swallowing only the kernel.
Totally unlike the Sibias, the}'&apos; are very fond of the ground, never
running but progressing by hops and bounds; and the speed with which
they can scuttle over the ground and about the thickets is astonishing.
My pair, by the way, are building in an elder bush ; but the Sibias seem
more shy, and have not progressed beyond the kissing stage.

Sir,--I shall be very glad if you will kindly help me as to the
treatment of a Gouldian Finch.
Last Wednesday I received a pair from London, freshly imported
birds I expedt. I was delighted with them, as they were the healthiest and
spriglitliest birds I have ever seen come off a journey. They are both in
perfedt plumage. I have kept them for one day in a wooden cage, and then
turned them into a large cage, full of Parson Finches, Grass Finches, and
other smaller birds.
They were quite peaceable for a day, hut I noticed the cock beginning
to look puffed out, and getting worse daily. Finally I had to remove
them, as he was bullied by a Parson cock. Now he sits all day hunched on
a perch, and has begun to make a noise with his hill, like a person grinding
his teeth. I do not know what causes this, but always consider it an
ominous symptom.
They are fed on canary seed and white and spray millet, and have
coarse river sand and cuttle-fish bone. I gave them bay salt yesterday, and
the hen ate a little; but I have not seen the cock touch it. They are in a
room without a fire, but with an even temperature of about 54 or 55 degrees.
I may mention that I got a Long-tailed Grassfinch hen at the same time
and she remains perfectly well.

A month ago I purchased a pair of Gouldians for a friend, and the
cock of that pair, tho' in good plumage, is not at all well--sits huddled up
and breathing heavily. They won't touch Setaria glauca or green food.
Mabeg M. Tate.
The following reply was sent to Miss Tate.
Unseasoned Gouldian Finches are often very weak and out of health,
and are quite unfit to rough it with Parson Finches and other robust birds.
They require care, and should be treated as invalids for a time. They
are susceptible to cold, and require more warmth than you have been
giving your birds.
Moreover, birds in the hands of dealers are usually fed very plainly,
and rarely are supplied with anything in the form of grit. When suddenly
launched into the midst of plenty, they sometimes eat a great deal more
than they are in a condition to digest, and sometimes even will kill them-
selves with grit and surfeit.
I should feel inclined to give them a little fluid magnesia and fluid
extract of taraxacum in their drinking water ; and you might try a little
glycerine.
May I suggest that, for the present, you keep them warm, that you
cover all but the front of their cage with green baize or something of the
kind (and do not place them in a draught or too near the window), and
that you feed them plainly; and do not give them green food.
I should give rock salt in preference to bay salt.

THE CAPE SPARROW.
Passer arcuatus.
By D. Seth-Smith, M.B.O.U.
The Cape, or Crescent Sparrow inhabits, as the British
Museum Catalogue tells us, "South Africa, eastwards to the
Transvaal and westwards to Benguela." In its habits it seems to
correspond very closely with our too familiar P. domesticus,
making a large untidy nest either in a tree or under the eaves
of a house, and generally frequenting the abodes of man.
Andersson, quoted in Bayard and Sharpe's Birds of South Africa,
states: " This Sparrow is very abundant all over Damara and
Great Namaqua Land, and extends as far south as the Cape,
where, however, it seems a trifle larger than in Damara Land ;
it takes up its abode near to man, and in all its habits exactly
resembles the House Sparrow of Europe."
The late Dr. Stark, however, in his recently-published
work ou the Birds of South Africa, referring to this species,
remarks, "This Sparrow is still to be found living a perfectly
wild life, at a great distance from human habitations, in main-
parts of Little Namaqualand and the Great Karroo desert. . . .
It seems probable that this Sparrow was originally a desert bird,
and has comparatively recently changed its habits in certain
districts, and adapted itself to a town or village life."
Mr. A. C. Haagner writes thus in the "Ibis," for Jan.,
1901, 011 Birds nesting in the Transvaal, " I also found several
nests of the common Sparrow of this district (Passer arcuatus&apos;).
The eggs of these birds are subject to an enormous amount of
variation. I have taken eggs almost black in colour, owing to
the profusion and darkness of the blotches, and others from the
same nest almost white, the blotches being very light in colour
and sparsely distributed. I also found in one of their nests an
unknown egg, presumably that of a Cuckoo (Chrysococcyxcupreus)
which is known locally as the " Diederic." The egg was smaller
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999594255813953" page_id="10098727"  page_num="166" year="" vol="">
than that of the real owner of the nest, and of a dirty white,
blotched in the form of a ring round the obtuse end with purplish
and greyish brown. These Cuckoos are known to generally
deposit their eggs in the nests of Passer arcuatus ."
I obtained a pair of this handsome Sparrow in the Autumn
of last year (1900) ; they were excessively wild at first and always
tried to hide away in any corner they could find, and I ex-
perienced considerable difficulty in inducing them to show them-
selves sufficiently to enable me to sketch them, as they would
crouch in the corner of their cage, usually one on the top of the
other, and nothing would induce them to stand on their perch in
a natural position.
Early in April I transferred them to a wire enclosure some
twenty feet long by twelve feet wide, planted with a few shrubs,
and containing a fair amount of shelter. In this they banged
about a good deal at first, but soon appeared to get used to their
surroundings, and quite content with their lot in life; in fact, so
reconciled did they become that within a month they were
seriously contemplating nesting in earnest.
There was a wooden box about nine inches square with a
hole in the front, hanging to the wall, sheltered from the weather
by some galvanized iron sheets above, but in no way hidden
from view. In this a nest was built, composed of sticks, straw,
and other rubbish, a cup-shaped depression being formed at the
farther end, which was lined with feathers. I had noticed that a
quantity of material had been taken into the box, but the birds
were so shy, and appeared so absolutely unconcerned, and as if
nothing was farther from their thoughts than serious breeding,
that I thought probably this was merely a comfortable nest for
them to sleep in. I am generally absent from home all day, and
can only visit the aviary in the early morning and evening ; at
such times both sparrows would invariably be as far from the
nest as possible, and I little expected that it contained any eggs.
My suspicions were however aroused on May 19th, when, having
a free afternoon, I hid myself in a corner of the aviary and
watched its inmates. The Sparrows, I at once noticed, were un-
usually active in hunting apparently for live insects. They
would occasionally visit the soft food dish and pick out the ants'
cocoons, then away to the nest one of them would fly, soon to
return for another dainty morsel, when the other would fly off to
the nest. The fact was now perfectly clear that the nest con-
tained--not eggs--but young birds. I could see that the food
supplied did not quite satisfy the pair ; they would scatter their

soft food mixture about a good deal as though something were
lacking in it, and I knew that if the young were to be reared I
must lose no time in supplying insects in some form or other.
Here a difficulty arose, tor the only creatures obtainable were
mealworms, and now and then a few cockroaches, and these were
greedily sought after by many of the other inmates of the aviary,
and a handful of the former would be gone in no time. How-
ever, all went well until the 30th May, when a half-fledged
youngster was discovered dead on the ground below the nest
box, and the parents were seen to be building another nest.
The nest was examined and two more young birds were found,
both dead. I suppose the cause of failure was our inability to
supply a sufficient quantity of insects, and I don't think meal-
worms are very suitable, but we did our best, and hope for
better luck next time.
Although a strongly built and powerful bird, apparently
the exact counterpart of P. domesticus , I have not found the
Cape Sparrow a dangerous companion for the smallest of the
ornamental finches, several of which share the same enclosure.
Sparrows are not, however, as a rule, safe companions for birds
less in size than themselves. I have known the small P. hdeus
do considerable execution in an aviary of small finches; so,
perhaps, my Cape Sparrows may be an exceptionally meek and
mild pair.
This is rather a silent Sparrow. I have never heard it
utter the continuous chirruping so often indulged in by P.
domesticus; many of its other notes are, however, identical with
those of that species, especially its harsh warning note. It
utters also sounds closely resembling the notes of a Budgerigar.

While passing through the Parrot House at the Zoo, on
June 1st last, I noticed a Pied Grey Waxbill: it was the first
time I had come across anything of the kind, though
melanism is quite common with the Avadavat, so I took par-
ticular notice of it and drew the attention of the keeper to
it, and I understood him to say that it came into their posses-
sion in February last, when it was of the normal colour, and
he had not observed the change. I carefully observed the bird,
and, while it was fully adult, I should not say it was an aged
specimen. I made the following notes: Flights and larger
</bodyText>

wing-coverts, mostly white; tail-feathers, tipped with white ;
top of head, splashed with white ; throat, very light, almost
white. This variation (for it seemed more or less merged into
the plumage generally) imparted to it a somewhat silvery
appearance. I shall certainly note it particularly during my
fortnightly visits there, while the summery weather lasts.
I also noted four very handsome birds there, which have
been presented to the Society by our member, Mr. E. W. Harper,
F.Z.S., viz., Great Barbet, Indian Green Barbet, Silver-eared
Mesia, and Blue-winged Siva. All of them were new to me,
and of the four named, I do not retain a very clear recollection
of the Great Barbet, save that it was more soberly clad than its
compatriot, the Indian Green Barbet; but it was a bold hand-
some bird, of large build yet elegant form, having large and
beautiful dark eyes.
The Indian Green Barbet was clad in several shades of
rich mossy green, and was also of large build, elegant form and
bold demeanour, large dark lustrous eyes. It is about two inches
longer than our Blackbird, and stouter, yet quite as active in its
movements, which are similar. It was hopping from perch to
perch, unmoved and unscared by the many visitors who braved
the screeching Parrots on the occasion of my visit. It would be
a handsome and most desirable addition to the bird-room.
The Blue-winged Siva (Siva cyanuroptera). This bird is
exquisitely beautiful, about the size of our Chaffinch though not
quite so thick in body, seems to be as pert and active in its
movements, while lacking the wildness of Fringilla. Its
plumage is light brown above, greyish white below, top of head
blue with dark lines, the flights and tail are rich cobalt tipped
with white ; it has brown eyes, flesh-coloured feet ; the upper
mandible is blackish and the lower yellow. The colours are so
beautifully harmonised, with an entire absence of harshness--in
fact I consider it more beautiful than even the Violet - eared
Waxbill.
Silver-eared Mesia (Mesia argentauris). This bird reminds
one at once of the Yellow-bellied Eiothrix (Liothrix luteus )
though it is a little longer, and lacks the forked tail of the
Eiothrix. The plumage is also similar, perhaps a little coarser ;
the reds and yellows are more showy, it has a black cap and
lovely silvery-grey ear-coverts ; this beautiful tint also extends
somewhat over the cheeks : (hence its name, Silver-eared Mesia,
is at once appropriate and descriptive) ; eyes dark brown, bill
and feet yellow.

<bodyText confidence="0.983467461538462" page_id="10098730"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
As far as I could judge, it resembled Liothrix lu/eus in its
movements, in fact, many who had only a passing knowledge of
the Pekin Robin might easily mistake it for that bird. But an
aviculturist will at once note its more graceful appearance, and
also its more showy plumage and beautiful ear-coverts and
cheeks.
The above descriptions are utterly inadequate to do justice
to these handsome birds, and I certainly hope either Air. Harper
or Mr Finn will follow these rough notes with a full description
of their wild life, and also their demeanour in captivity.
From what I saw at the Zoo they would evidently thrive
on fruit, usual soft-food mixture, with a few mealworms, gentles,
etc. All four were males.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
One of our members lamented lately that the Magazine
was too much given up to the larger birds--the Parrots, Ducks,
Cranes and other coarsely built members of the feathered family,
whilst the Serins and other more general favourites were being-
shelved. Although I cannot say that the above-mentioned
larger birds were ever special favourites with me, I must admit
that I was pleased to see the pages of the Magazine devoted to
Aviculture as a whole, rather than restricted in its scope.
When one comes to think of it, there is not very much
new to be learned about the more ordinarily imported Finches ;
there is a sameness about their mode of nidification throughout
whole families which precludes one from anticipating anything
very startling even when one breeds a species for the first time.
It is true that the discovery of metallic warts on the edges of
the gape in the youug of some Ploceid Finches was a little
surprising when first observed; it is also perhaps interesting to
note how Finches which, in a wild state, prefer to build an open
nest in a bush, will, in captivity, select a Hartz travelling-cage
in preference ; but you do not find one species (as in the Ducks)
depositing its eggs in marshy ground in a well-formed and well-
lined nest and another placing its eggs high up in a hole in a
tree: you do not find one species, as in the Parrots, building a
huge nest of twigs, and another laying its eggs in a hole with no
nest whatever.
Well, all this does not tell the readers of the Alagazine
much about Serin-finches; sol must proceed to give the best
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999315372093024" page_id="10098731"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
account I can of the few species which have at various times
come into my hands, and if some of our other members will
supplement my notes by giving an account of species which
they have had, we shall doubtless acquire some useful information
from one another.
Of all the imported Serins I consider the Grey Singing-
finch (Serinus leucopygius) to be, by far, the most attractive : it
makes no pretence at showy plumage, being a veritable little
Quaker, but its song is, in my opinion, sweeter than that of any
other Finch.
I should not like to say how many specimens of Grey
Singing-finches I have kept, because I invariably purchase all
that are offered to me, yet I have never succeeded in breeding
the species nor am I absolutely certain how to distinguish the
sexes.
The late Mr. Abrahams, who certainly was very clever in
picking out sexes of Grey Singing-finches, assured me that the
cock bird always showed a whiter spot on the centre of the
throat especially when singing. I used to sit and watch for
that spot just as a man wearied with insomnia watches for the
morning; but I must confess I never caught a glimpse of it; I
believe, however, that it is possible to pick out the hens by their
slightly browner tint and more strongly streaked flanks. I have
found the average of imported specimens to be about two hens
to every cock bird ; but as the hens almost invariably die from
egg-binding, it is as well that one should secure a majority of
the weaker sex if ambitious to breed this Serin.
When I wrote the article on this bird in my " Foreign
Finches in Captivity." I suggested that it was a good plan to
keep several cocks together in the same aviary ; since the more
these birds fought, the more they sang : this is quite true; but
I have since discovered that an isolated male in a flight cage
eighteen inches in cubic measure, sings every fine day through-
out the year excepting when moulting. My pet songster was paired
with a small German hen Canary for two years ; she hatched
and partly reared one mule ; and then, with its flight and tail
feathers half-grown, the stupid little thing unaccountably died :
in the following summer its mother followed its bad example,
since which time I have kept the father alone, but he seems
remarkably happy.
Dr. Russ compares the song with that of the Woodlark
and Canary, but it neither has the varied bell-like trills of the
former, nor the irritating shrill thrice repeated whistle which
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.999532860465116" page_id="10098732"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
mars the song of the latter bird : it is really much more like a
sweet Skylark's song, rather more varied and without the long
dropping notes which the Skylark utters as he returns to earth.
The habit of this little Serin of turning his head from side to
side all the time that he is singing appears to have a somewhat
modulating effect upon the notes.
The St. Helena Seed-eater (Serinus flaviveyitris) is
perhaps the handsomest of the imported species ; and, in my
experience, is the longest-lived ; I purchased a pair from Mr.
Abrahams in 1887, the hen of which died, I think, in 1891, but
the cock remained in fairly good health and sang until 1900,
dying on December 16th.
The song of this Serin is very like that of the Grey
Singing-finch, but is much louder and more rarely heard;
indeed I do not think I ever heard my cock bird sing excepting
in the summer months, and then only perhaps two or three
times a day unless he chanced to be trying to charm a hen Green
Singing-finch. I have recorded my failure to cross it with
Canary hens, chiefly owing to its extremely quarrelsome
disposition : indeed, as it is the handsomest, so is it the most
combative of all the Serins which I have kept.
The Green Singing-finch (Seyimis icterus) is almost like
a small edition of the preceding, but with a very inferior though
even louder song ; both sexes sing at times, and the performance,
though scrappy and consisting of short joyous shouts of song
rather than a connected melody, must be extremely pleasing
when a flock of this species can be heard in a state of freedom.
This bird is almost as quarrelsome and occasionally more
malicious in its combats than the St. Helena Seed-eater : it is
moreover undoubtedly a mischievous egg-eater. There is not
the least difficulty in getting the Green Singing-finch to pair
and build in an aviary ; the hen lays her clutch of white eggs
and then they gradually all disappear: this has happened with
my birds on five occasions, and the presence of a pair of these
birds in an aviary with birds smaller than themselves seems at
once to put a stop to all breeding in that aviar) r , all the eggs
disappearing mysteriously.
With regard to the distinction which Mr. Abrahams used
to make between individuals of the Green Singing-finch, it is
worthy of note that the British Museum Catalogue does not
acknowledge them. I believe myself that my friend Mr.
Abrahams distinguished the older birds, in which the face mark-
ings were blacker, under the name of the Bearded Seed-eater,
</bodyText>

172
</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.996398395348837" page_id="10098733"  page_num="172" year="" vol="">
and called the younger birds and the middle-aged hens the
Green Singing-finch. I know that if you purchased a bird with
well-developed marking on the face and another with the face
markings weakly indicated you were almost certain to find that
you had secured a pair.
I cannot say I like the Green Singing-finch. I object to
mischievous and to spiteful birds, and I have known one Green
Singing-finch to kill smaller birds than itself. I suppose I have
had, altogether, some four or five pairs, but I shall not buy auy
more : the species is fairly long-lived, and I still have a hen which
I must have purchased some five or six years ago at least.
The Sulphur Seed-eater {Serinus sulphuratus ) is one of the
largest of the Serins, and has a beak shaped like a Grosbeak :
he is an ugly, powerful-looking bird, almost giving one the idea
of a disreputable hen Greenfinch, only he is not half so hand-
some.
The late Mr. Abrahams gave me a cock of this somewhat
rarely imported bird in November, 1899, and I paired it with a
Norwich Canary, which treated it with contempt. It sang a few&apos;
notes, but not worthy to be called a song. Subsequently I turned
it out into an aviary with many other birds, and discovered that
this bird, for all his aggressive aspect and powerful beak, was
innocent as a sucking-dove, and that his vaunted song was a
fraud : he died early in the present year.
It is easy for me now to comprehend why a bird, common
in S. Africa, as the Sulphur Seed-eater is, should not be freely
imported : the aviculturist generally expects to get either beauty
or song for his money; if neither is forthcoming, a bird does
not catch on.
Another ugly bird, far more so than the preceding, is the
White-throated Seed-eater (Serinus albigularis ) of which I once
possessed a specimen : it looked as if it could bite the head off
any bird its own size which offended it, but it was a most mild-
tempered creature ; and although reputed to be a fine singer,
never uttered a note to the day of its death.
The Cape Canary (,Serinus canicollis ) or Grey-necked
Serin is another bird for the possession of which I was indebted
to the liberality of my late friend, who sent me a rather aged
specimen in order that I might hear the song. Dr. Russ speaks
of the song as Tark-like ; I found it rather monotonous, of the
nature of that of the Hartz-mountain Roller, but far shorter and
less varied ; indeed I considered it a poor performance. This
species is easily crossed with the common Canary.

NESTING OE A HEN NONPAREIL, AND CHANGE OF
PLUMAGE IN COCKS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999286659574468" page_id="10098734"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
I venture to relate the story of a widowed Nonpareil, which nested in
one of my aviaries last year, and which, but for a torrential storm of rain,
would, in all probability, have succeeded in rearing a young one. It is not
easy to procure hen Nonpareils; but in 1S97 I succeeded in purchasing a
nice pair. The cock subsequently died, but in time I got a new husband
for the widowed hen. Last year I turned them out into a nice umbrageous
aviary. On June 30th I ran into the aviary to look to some young Passerine
Doves, whose parents had according to their custom begun to neglect them.
As I went hurriedly out I had a vague suspicion that a bird flew out of the
door over my head. It was too well founded, the cock Nonpareil had
escaped. I was going out and could not stay to watch him. In the evening
I found him making frantic efforts to get through the wire to his mate.-but
he never came near the door. He slept on a Scotch fir tree, and next morn-
ing renewed his efforts to get in. Then he went off, and was only once seen
again, about a week afterwards, in my coachman's garden, a quarter of a
mile from the aviar) T . On the 9U1 of July, to my great surprise, I found the
little wddow sitting on three eggs in a neat little nest which she had built
in a China rose bush. Of course, at first I had but faint hopes of her per-
severing in her solitary task, but on referring to Mr. Farrar's account of the
nesting of his Nonpareils, I took heart when I read that the hen did most of
the feeding. She sat indefatigably, and in due time hatched one very strong
young one, and then a weaker one, which died in a few days. The third
egg was unfertile. She continued most assiduous in her care of the sur-
viving youngster. When I came round with mealworms, she generally flew r
to the wire to meet me, but at times I was obliged to push her off the nest
to induce her to feed. Things went on well for tw&apos;elve days; the young
bird grew and feathered fast; but then came a terrible night of thunder and
torrential rain. The nest was somewhat exposed; the next morning the
hen looked drenched and wretched, and seemed inattentive to the nestling.
The nest was wet and the inmate miserable. When the mother at last took
it a bit of a mealworm it was listless and indifferent, and in 24 hours it was
dead.
I think it worth while relating this story, for, had it not been for this
violent storm, the solitary hen would in all probability have reared her
offspring unaided. Should any of our members have an accident like my
own (and I know of no birds so clever at escaping as Nonpareils) it would
be well at least to give a hen Nonpareil the chance of nesting. I am just
now turning out the same hen with a handsome new mate, into the same
aviary, in which the foundation of her last year's nest still remains.
While writing of Nonpareils I cannot help referring to the question,
which has been raised in the pages of the Magazine, as to whether male
birds have or have not both summer and winter garbs. O11 page 166 of
Vol. V., I read that Mr. Farrar's undoubtedly have changed colour. He
wrote, " In the winter the cock is quite a sober looking gentleman, and onlv
gets his splendid livery as summer draws on." I11 a note, however, to this
Dr. Butler wrote, " I have had a good many of these birds, but my males
never put on a different plumage for the winter." My own experience, in

the cases of the three cocks which I have had to live any length of time,
has not been quite the same as that of either Mr. Farrar or Dr. Butler.
They have become "sober looking" after the moult; the bright blue head
has turned to bluish grey, the scarlet breast to lemon colour, but un-
fortunately as summer has advanced they have entirely failed to resume
their "splendid livery." Mr. Frostick, some time ago, warned me that
they must be " colour-fed" during the moult, if they are to keep their bright
hues in this climate. O. E. CRESSWEbb-

all he meant to ask for was the body of any specimens that members did

the latter, but having no room for them sold them to a dealer. I was much

Macaws but Macaw Parrakeets. The 1 atter I never heard of. They are exactly
like the picture of Illiger's Macaw in Greene's "Parrots in Captivitj&apos;; "
I can see no difference anywhere.
Also would you tell me if the Leadbeater's Cockatoo and Rock
Pepler Parrakeet have been bred in captivity. I11 Dr. Greene's book no

was edited. M. A. Johnstone.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Johnstone :
All the Macaws are Parrakeets. There are about twenty known species
of Macaws; it follows, therefore, that there are some twenty different
species of " Macaw Parrakeets." The name " Macaw Parrakeet " is there-
fore vague and meaningless.
The following is the description of Illiger's Macaw (Ara maracana) as
given in the Museum Catalogue of Birds:--

Sir, --Would you kindly identify the dead bird herewith, also the

Same shape as a Linnet but rather longer; head, throat, and nape
bright chestnut-brown ; wings light grey barred with bright saffron-yellow,

The following reply was sent to Mr. Heselton :
Although the bird you sent to me was in very poor condition, I have

The other bird, which you describe, is doubtless Emberiza luteola,

Sir,--I n May last, at pp. 140- r, I referred to the partial failure of
Battle's Vermin Killer to kill my mice. The acting agent in this poison is,
I am told, strychnine.
In the Zoologist for June, which has just come to hand, at page 235,

amongst the Editorial Gleanings, some interesting particulars, taken from
" Merck's Annual Report for 1900," are given of the occasional failure of
strychnine to effectively dispose of dogs and other animals to which this
poison had been administered. The few words which chiefly concern us
run as follows: -- " Complaints have, however, been made for a number of
years to the effect that at times strychnine has shown itself ineffective,
especially with large animals, which has induced the writer to enquire into
the causes of this phenomenon. Strychnine and its salts--in particular its
nitrate--which is commonly used for poisoning purposes, are, chemically,
very stable compounds, and their toxic efficacy remains unchanged for
years. Its occasional inefficiency can therefore have its cause exclusively
in the mode of administration, the state of the bodj r , especially the extent
to which the stomach is charged, and the presence or absence of the
tendency to vomit .... It appears that strychnine nitrate may be
administered internally to Dogs in the solid form without detriment to
the degree and promptness of its action .... wlieras they recovered if the
same dose was given in the form of a solution."
It will be seen, therefore, that my case was not unique, except in
matters of detail.
Unfortunately the article does not give us any practical assistance in
the disposing of our mice. While stating the exact amount of strychnine
which must be administered in order to kill certain animals, from the lion
and the bear to the fowl and the pigeon, the all important mouse has been
omitted form the list, perhaps for the obvious reason that, if we can catch
a mouse for the purpose of balling it with a definite weight of strychnine,
we may possibly be able to dispense with the strychnine altogether.
Perhaps I should point out that Battle&apos;s Vermin Killer used to be
effective here, but seemed steadily to lose its power over the mice. Assuming
it to have been unadulterated and not too stale, there must have been some
resisting or non-receptive condition in the mice themselves, increasing as
the use of the poison was continued, that caused this gradual failure; and
the latter seems to point, as I suggested, to a breed of mice having been
raised here which, self-inoculated generation after generation, had become
practically immune.
But I have got rid of the mice for the present. For several months
I have been using fully a dozen common break-back traps baited with a
good lump of cooked beef. The best meat is not necessary for this purpose;
some of the less valuable parts will do, only let it be a good solid lump.
The traps are hidden away behind boxes, furniture, etc., are scattered about
all over the house, and are left untouched for two or three weeks, when
they are re-baited. Of course they must not be placed where the birds can
get at them. It is important that the traps should be regularly inspected,
and all captures promptly removed.
For how long the mice have retired I do not know. I11 the mean-
while, I and my birds are happy. Reginald Phipgipps.

NESTING OF DIUCA FINCHES.

By Rosie Aedekson.
There is so little mention of the Diueri Finch in the past
volumes of the Magazine that perhaps the following account may
be of some interest to any member who may be thinking of
adding these handsome birds to his or her collection.
I saw my first and only pair of Diuca Finches at the
Crystal Palace Show, October, 1899. The price asked was 15/-,
and I greatly admired the birds, but felt undecided whether to
purchase them. Finally I wrote the same night to ask if they
were still unsold ; I found they were, and so became their owner.
The Diucas arrived a da} 7 or two later, and appeared so healthy
that I at once turned them loose in the aviary. And now before
going any further I must describe their appearance. The
general colour of the cock is blue-grey, with darker feathers
(edged with chestnut brown) in the wings and tail. The throat
is pure white, the grey meeting in a broad band across the chest ;
the breast, under parts, and under-tail feathers are also white,
and a bright chestnut patch adorns each flank. The legs, feet,
and beak are lead-coloured, the eyes black and bold, and edged
with a very narrow line of white feathers. The hen is practically
the same as the cock, but the grey is of a browner shade, and
the white not so snowy. Both birds are about the same size,
rather larger than a Java Sparrow, and have the power of raising
the head feathers when excited like a crest, in a very becoming
way.
I learnt from their former owner that they had been bred
in Germany, but that the real habitat of the bird was Brazil,
Each bird was marked with a little metal ring round one leg.
I have said I turned the Diucas loose in the aviary, but at
once bitterly repented it. The newcomers quickly began to
bully the smaller inmates, and the whole place was thrown into

a state of confusion. I began to think sorrowfully that I must
part with my handsome birds, but the first encounter was
reassuring. My little Pileated Finch, "Jan," a great favourite of
mine, stood bravely up to the cock Diuca, raising his scarlet
crest in great indignation, and to his shame the big bird beat a
retreat.
I purchased the Diucas in October, and in December they
began a nest of heather, but fortunately, as it was so late, it came
to nothing. Another nest was started in March, this time a very
pretty one, composed of fine shavings, butthey again seemed to tire
of it, and pulled it to pieces. Both birds were extremely fond of
rape seedlings, and would nip off the heads as cleanly as if cut
with a pair of scissors.
About this time I noticed one day an amusing incident, as
illustrating what a coward the Diuca really was. I had had a
Grey Cardinal given to me, brought by some friends of mine from
Madeira. It was then, and always has been, the quietest of birds,
and at present is constantly chased by a fiery little cock
Combasou, but this by the way. On the introduction of the
Cardinal into the aviary the cock Diuca--thinking to make a
grand show off before the hen (I am certain it was for no other
reason, for she watched the whole time), ran after the Cardinal,
and pecked him from behind; the latter seemed perfectly uncon-
scious, but finally turned round accidently, when the Diuca at
once fled. He tried to renew his attacks, but the Cardinal was
quite indifferent to him, so he gave it up, evidently concluding
that it is very poor fun bullying anyone who doesn't even notice
you. Again the Diucas began a nest, this time in a cigar box, and
progressed so far as to hatch a fine young one. They fed it on
nothing but insects, and unfortunately my supply ran short, and
to my great grief it died, and was thrown out of the nest. Had
I had a sufficient supply of mealworms it would probably have
lived, but I had then no idea that the young fed on only insect food,
and my stock had got low. I gave them my last mealworm, and
tried in vain to get more in time, but, though I had some ordered,
the tradesman would not send them promptly, and despite his
promise to despatch them on a certain day, (in reply to my
urgent telegram) he failed me, and the poor little Diuca died of
, starvation. I tried to substitute woodlice, but the old birds,
though they took them at first, soon tired of them. It was
pitiful to see the anxiety of the parents, how they flew to me for
mealworms every time I came into the aviary, when I had
none to give them. I tried at the flour mills, but could hear of

none, and when those I had ordered at last came, of course it
was too late.
I was very disappointed, for the dead young one was
quite a large size and looked very healthy.
Early in June the Diucas tried again. This time I
determined to do better, and wrote to their former owner to ask
if he would mind giving me the address of the breeder of the
birds. This he very kindly did, and I wrote at once to Germany.
I got a most courteous answer, telling me that the old birds
would feed the young on nothing but insects or mealworms, and
that I was to remember as most important to leave some meal-
worms overnight for the birds to find first thing in the morning (a).
This fourth nest the Diucas built in half a cigar box (placed
lengthways on). The nest was very neat, made chiefly of hay,
with a soft lining of feathers. One egg was thrown out, and
also a newly-hatched young bird, after the hen had sat some
time. A little later an older bird, with grey down on the head,
was found dead on the floor, and I began to fear I was again to
fail.
On the whole the hen sat well, but was rather restless
sometimes. During this time the cock ceased his love song of
six sharp notes, and became almost silent.
The remaining two eggs were hatched about June 20th, as
far as I could tell. Both the parents fed the young on cut up meal-
worms, but the cock seemed to let the hen have the leading
share in the operations, giving her the mealworms, and she in turn
would give them to the young birds. The parents were
absurdly jealous, and attacked every innocent bird that came
near the nest. O11 July 7th was first heard the joyful sound of
the young ones chirping, and three days later I got a glimpse of
the open beaks of the two nestlings.- They were very wide, with a
thick wax skin round the mouth. The cock began now to
attempt to sing his former song again. The elder 3 r oung one
emerged from the nest on July 12th. It was a very pretty
looking little thing, decidedly perky in its appearance and
movements. The tawny and white markings were less decided,
otherwise it was much the same colour as the hen bird. It
retired back to the nest at night, and the next day No. 2 came
really out. I had previously seen it leave the nest for a moment
and then go back. This nestling was younger, and not so strong
as No 1. Its feet began to get very weak, and on Sunday, July
[a). I am also indebted to one of our Members who very kindly helped me in this
difficulty.--R.A.

15th, it could no longer climb into the branches (the nest being
very high up) but stayed on the floor. Its legs were so weak
that they gave way on each side, and it appeared to balance
itself on its tail. It was very pretty and downy, and seemed the
mother's favourite. Gradually it got worse, losing first the use
of one leg, and finally of both. I decided at last to chloroform
it (for its case seemed hopeless, and the old birds began to
neglect the poor little thing) but I was spared this, for it fell
into the water fountain and was drowned.
I had tried to feed it myself, but found almost the only
way I could get it to eat was to cut a mealworm behind the
head, and, having thus killed it, to squeeze it against the beak,
the little nestling seeming to enjoy it and sucking it in.
By July 17th the surviving young bird could fly, and was
lusty and vigorous, and nearly half as large as an adult bird.
The parents again started to nest, and one day we noticed
the cock behaving very strangely. He took a mealworm, and
ran up to the hen (apparently with his usual intention of giving
it to her) but suddenly ran back ; this action he repeated four or
five times, each time uttering a strange note ; finally he gave the
mealworm to the young one. The old birds' method of feeding
the young was very curious. They would carry a mealworm up
to the nestling, who cried and flapped its wings, and drop it
into its open mouth, and then pull it out again, doing this about
six times before it was arranged to their satisfaction and they
would allow the young one to swallow it ; perhaps they squeezed a
little of the mealworm down the young one's throat each time,
I cannot tell.
The giving of mealworms so many times in the day was
very awkward, for so many other birds in the aviary were fond
of them, and I had to guard the saucer until the Diucas had
emptied it. So I determined to cage them, and managed it
successfully, transferring both the old birds and the young one
to a large cage five feet long. I also moved the nest (it was the
same they had built in before, and was very clean inside,
and contained one fresh egg) and put it in a fresh box, and hung
it up in the cage. Two days later the family had quite settled
down, and five eggs in all were laid and hatched, but for some
unknown reason all the young ones were thrown out when only
a few days old. It seemed a great pity, for they looked so strong
and healthy. It was very amusing to see the cock go to tell the
hen when I put any fresh mealworms into the cage. She would
at once come off the nest, feed the young bird with a worm, and

then go back again. The young Diuca tried to feed itself on
seed on August 2nd (the cock feeding it on seed as well) but it
preferred being fed to feeding itself.
The eggs of the Diuca Finch are about the same size as
those of the Robin : pale blue-green in colour, splashed all over
with brown, not unlike a Rook's egg on a small scale.
In November my young Diuca died, after being ill a few
days; it was a fine bird, and I think, from its colour, a hen. I
also lost the cock last March, and have now only the hen left.
She is in splendid health and plumage, and very anxious for a
mate, and has built a nest among the fir branches.
The cock Diuca took a most violent dislike to a cock
Nonpareil, after they had lived peaceably together for sometime.
I had to put each bird into a separate aviary ; and, on bringing
back the Nonpareil in a cage, the Diuca settled on it at once, and
tried to get at his enemy through the wires. Except for this, I
have never known the Diuca injure my other birds, though he
used to chase and tease them, (b)
THE BREEDING OF THE AMERICAN MOCKING
BIRD.
( Turdus polyglottusJ.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
For four years I have been trying to breed the American
Mocking-bird. Of course there will be failures. For three years
I failed dismally. Successes, by which we proposed to make our
rivals green with envy, do not come off. Birds on which we
set our hopes go to the Crematorium, but still we are not dis-
heartened. Hope springs eternal in the human breast; and so
it did in mine.
For three years I tried valiantly to breed from two cocks.
Perhaps my readers will smile: but it is not so easy to tell a hen
Mocking-bird as some people imagine. I know what they say
in books and Advice Columns in the papers ; I, alas, followed
these guides, only to meet with disappointment. For three years
(6). According to the Museum Catalogue, the Diuca Finch conies from Chili, not
Brazil. Two young were bred in the Loudon Zoological Gardens in 1887 ; it seems to me
to be a free breeder. I have not found the male to be a coward, but abominably quarrel-
some and vindictive, this summer, in the open aviary, hunting and even breaking a wing
of so active and comparatively large a bird as the Red-whiskered Bulbul. I have at last
been obliged to cut my bird's wings so short that he cannot fly at all ; nevertheless he has
as much assurance as ever, and, commencing before day-break, sings away all day as if
nothing had happened and he were master of the whole aviary.--K.P.

I had beautiful nests built, but no eggs were laid ; I blamed the
' cat' and all sorts of things, but never suspected the true cause,
the gender of the birds. What at last undeceived me was a
battle royal that I fortunately witnessed, in which one of the
contending parties lost an eye. Then my mind was at rest. I
knew why I had failed, and at once proceeded to look for the
remedy. It was a case of ' cherchez la femme ' again : a very
difficult task in this case. The only way that I could see was to
get half-a-dozen Mocking-birds together and compare them, on
the off-chance that there might be a hen among them. I sent to
a friend, and he kindly allowed me a consignment to pick from.
For long enough I looked at them, but for the life of me I could
not pick out much difference. Some had more white on the
wing ; some were lighter, some darker ; but I felt sure they w T ere
cocks by their build and carriage. At last I thought about
Parrots : in some you can tell the sex by the eye. I looked over
the Mocking-birds, and lo, two of a big cageful had green eyes,
and all the rest gravel. " Eureka," I cried, " I have found out
the secret." And so I had, for with the green eye there went
a general look of femininity.
The best of the two hens I lost as nearly as a pop, as we
say up here. I was ill in bed for a week, and the attendant who
looked after the birds for me forgot to fill the water pot. I never
saw a bird more nearly gone ; but by superhuman effort I
managed to pull her round.
In the early spring, I liberated this hen with the one-eyed
cock into a nice big aviary thickly planted--a regular Mocking-
bird Paradise. Their companions were a pair of Bearded Tits, a
pair of Red-eared Bulbuls, and a pair of Blackcaps, and two
Chinese Quails. The Mockers, in spite of the bad character
many give them, molested their neighbours in no wise ; but
confined themselves to their own domestic affairs. For a few
days the cock sang most magnificently, and no one who has not
heard a Mocking-bird has any conception of his vocal powers.
He can imitate any bird to the life. I have heard mine call like
a hen Many-colour wanting to pair, and you would have sworn
that the Many-colour was there. I have heard him scold like a
Peggy Whitethroat to the life, squawk out like a Blackbird when
frightened, sing like the Blackcap, and all in the most life-like
manner.
After a few days given to song, he (the cock) settled down
to business. The cock, in the case of Mocking-birds, does
all the building ; the hen simply nods approval. The first

intimation of what was in progress was my seeing Master
Mocking-bird carrying old sticks in his bill. He soon selected a
site in an elder bush, and was busy as a bee over his task. The
nest is a beautiful structure, very strongly woven, externally of
sharp thorns and twigs, and warmly lined inside with the finest
grasses, and in a beautiful cup-shaped hollow. I sent the nest,
after the birds had flown, to t)r. Butler, as I thought he would
like to see it for himself.
Three eggs were laid ; they are very pale green in colour,
spotted all over with little brown blotches. The hen did all the
nesting, the cock feeding her attentively and signalling each
time that the mealworms were given out, that she should come
and get her share. This she never failed to do. At the end of
eleven days--speaking at a rough guess--I went and had a look,
as I thought I saw the birds carrying live bait about. Sure
enough, there were two fine youngsters in the nest, very pink
and very naked ; but very plump and well looking. One
unfertile egg remained. I did not like to take it out of the nest,
for fear the birds might not like it; so I left it to take its
chance, but as I expected, it got broken in the course of rearing.
I found the hatched egg shells at the very farthest point of
the aviary away from the nest. It is evidently instinct that tells
the parents to remove these tell-tales as far away as possible. I
sent these shells to Mr. Phillipps, knowing the interest he takes
in all hatching operations. He will say if I have described them
accurately. It was an early and late case of getting nourishment
into these youngsters. I did not dare to enter the aviary, and
had to content my soul with watching, like Moses' sister, " afar
off," to see what would happen.
Things went on all right, as I could see the birds at regular
intervals visit the nest with mealworms. They sort of threw
themselves sideways on the nest, light as shadows, in spite of
their size. All the time the young were in the nest the cock
never sang a note. To-day (June 17) when the young quitted
the nest, he opened out magnificently, proud, I suppose, of his
success. If they thought anyone was watching them they made
a loud sort of scolding noise.
The weather was not very propitious, all the time, for
rearing. What Fox once called " that little shower," was often
going on, to say nothing of several gales of wind.
It is not every one, may be, that acted like Solomon did
when he showed the Queen of Sheba all his royal treasures. I often
think it must have made Sheba look small when she got home.

Perhaps that is why I have written this paper. When I do any
thing worth telling, be sure I always run a pen-and-ink race to tell
you. I fancy that, as this article is read, there will be a rustling
demonstration of surprise, such as you may have observed in a
country congregation when they hear an allusion to their week-
day offences from the pulpit ! The only thing I regret in this
narrative is that that third egg did not hatch. I'm a little like poor
Mrs. Moss, in "The Mill on the Floss," who, although she had
eight children, could never overcome her regret that the twins
had not lived !

A SUPPOSED NEW WHISTLING-BIRD.
(Myiophoneus . ?)
By Reginald Phillipps.

<bodyText confidence="0.982840777777778" page_id="10098745"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
A few years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting a
gentleman (with his wife) belonging to the Indian Forests&apos;
Department. They told us how, every year, at the proper
season, the whole family and household went into camp for
some weeks, and travelled about in the forests, shifting their
camping-ground almost daily. During these annual expeditions,
they were brought face to face with wild nature in manifold
forms: and they couldn't speak too rapturously of some of the
charms and wonders they met with. Marvellous to relate, I feel
constrained to say, they were not aviculturists ; nevertheless
they had much to tell us of the birds and of their songs in an
indefinite way; and they were unanimous on one point that of
all others, and beyond all others, which sang the sweetest, the
merriest, and most continuously during their forest wanderings,
was the bird which was popularly known as Whistling Tom.
They were unable to describe this bird to me ; and for many a
day I remained in doubt as to the species.
On ist September, 1900, a bird of a species new to me
came into my hands, which was named Bob ; and I think it
probable that Whistling Bob and Whistling Tom are near
relations. Interesting as Whistling Tom may be, Whistling
Bob is still more so, for not only is he interesting in himself,
but he is specially interesting as apparently belonging to a
hitherto undescribed species of the genus Myiophoneus.
Whistling Tom, if I am right in referring him to this
genus, doubtless is either Temminck's or the Himalayan
Wliistling-bird (Myiophoneus temniincki ), mentioned by Mr.

C. L- Harrison at page 19 of Vol. IV. of our Magazine, or
Horsfield's Whistling-bird ( 1 \ 1 . horsfieldij, a species which has
been represented at the London Zoological Gardens in by-gone
days.
As soon as Bob (for the sake of convenience, I will call
him by this handy name) reached this country, I was invited by
a dealer to come and see a " blue bird from New Guinea." One of
our members had inspected him on the previous day, and, made
of sterner stuff, had returned home with his money in his pocket.
I, of weaker mould, was tempted and fell, and left my money in
the dealer's pocket--but then I had Bob ! ! !
The dealer's reiterated statements that he had been
assured that Bob came from New Guinea, having been obtained
at Townsville in Queensland (or Thursday Island), are important,
as tending to confirm my opinion that it is a new species ; for I
understand that no species of the genus Myiophoneus has yet
been found in that Island. I made what enquiries were possible
in the circumstances, and found that he was brought to England
in a Queensland steamer passing through Torres Straits, the
actual importer being (1) a reliable man and (2) a good man.
Some time later, thanks to Mr. Seth-Smith, it became pretty clear
that Bob was brought over by Mr. Carrick of our Society. When
Mr. Carrick is next in England, if this should meet his eye,
perhaps he will be so kind as to inform us what he knows of the
history of the bird, as a statement from him which would help
us to fix the country of origin would be of the greatest value.
So far as our present knowledge extends, seeing that the
genus has not been discovered in Australia, it is as likely that
Bob should have come from New Guinea as elsewhere. Vol. VII.
of the British Museum Catalogue of Birds was published in 1883.
Thanks to the courtesy of Dr. Butler, I have been informed by
the Museum authorities that two species of the genus Myiophoneus
have been discovered since the Catalogue was published, viz.,
M. borneensis (Ibis, 1885, pp. 123, 124 ; see also Ibis, 1901, p. 131),
and M. tibetanus (Ibis, 1886, p. 145^. These make up the number
of recognised species to thirteen ; but my specimen does not
agree with the published descriptions of any one of the thirteen.
New species are still being discovered from time to time ;
and a bird may well have escaped observation in such a country
as New Guinea, especially such a one as Bob, who has no
brilliant plumage nor loud note or cry to attract attention; and
is of so artful and cunning a nature that, should an army of
naturalists and collectors sweep New Guinea from end to end, it

would be unlikely that a single Whistling Bob would be detected,
although dozens might be in hiding in the holes and hollows of
the forest trees above their heads ; for a Whistling Bob would be
absolutely invisible ; and no amount of noise and confusion
below would cause it to move a muscle ; only by the merest
chance could such a bird be discovered. Any way, be this all as
it may, Books do not speak about Bob, so here is Bob to speak
for himself.
The general character of my bird's plumage and build is
the same as that of the genus. To the scientist, therefore, the
chief points of interest will be the points of difference. But I
find that living specimens of this genus are very little known in
this country ; and since Bob's arrival I have not met with a
single avieulturist who seemed to have any personal knowledge
of the Whistling-birds, or Whistling-Thrushes as they seem
generally to be called. I propose, therefore, in the present
paper, even at the risk of wearying some of our readers, to enter
somewhat fully, however unscientifically, into a description of
Bob's plumage, nature, and character.
Bob's plumage is difficult to describe, and very
disappointing when one wants to show him off to the best
advantage. So much so is this the case that to the casual
visitor, especially the lady visitor, I have ceased to take the
trouble to point him out, as to do so is usually to invite a taste
of mortification. On one occasion, my mortification was
turned into a triumph. Bob had been for some time in the
dining-room, where I keep a select few of the foreign birds during
the winter months, and had become accustomed to human
society. A young lady, who had ignored my reference to Bob's
rarity, passed him by with lofty indifference, and was chattering
away on the other side of the room. Suddenly she almost
screamed out, " Why, that bird 's blue ; i thought he was
black!" Bob, thinking he was unobserved, had just hopped
forward to the front of his cage ; and the lady's eye had chanced
to catch a glimpse of the true colour of the external plumage.
Bob objects to being interviewed, and at the approach of
a stranger quietly retires, and when driven out of his inner
chamber just dashes forward for a moment and immediately
disappears again. Moreover, the colour of the plumage differs
according to the light and direction from which it is viewed ;
like the sea, too, it differs with the colour of the sky, on a dull
day appearing dull black to the casual observer, the amount
of scarcely concealed black amongst the feathers aiding greatly

to produce this effect. A larger part, the hidden part, of
most of the feathers is black or dusky black, the apical
third or thereabout of the body feathers being purplish blue,
darkening to blue-black in places, with a glistening tip of silvery
gray or very light blue. On each wing (tips of median coverts)
there is a crescent of white spots. A black lore spot extends
just above and behind the eye, these black feathers wanting the
glistening tips ; and the under side of the tail is black. Across
the chest, along the sides, but not extending down the centre of
the lower breast, and round over the lower back, forming almost a
circle round the body, the feathers, or many of them, have
concealed white centres ; that is, a line or pointed slit of white,
quite narrow in some but broader in others, especially on the
sides and lower back, runs up or near the shaft almost from the
&amp;quot;base, but not so far as to become generally visible (c). On each
flank there is a little tuft of soft downy feathers, white on the
one web, and purplish blue or blue black on the other, the white
predominating. There are also some remarkable silky feathers
with the colours arranged nearly as last stated, but usually with
an edging of purple to the white web : I think these must
come from the sides, but am not sure of the exact position ; I
collected them during the moult. These feathers with white
centres form an irregular series, and are quite a feature in the
plumage of the bird. Commencing with those which have
simply a white shaft, we have others in which the white spreads
on each side of the shaft to the webbing, first in a lesser then in
a greater degree ; then there are a few with the white on only
one side of the shaft. These latter lead on to an extravagant
development of the white " centre," the one web being purplish
blue, the other white with only a little edging of the blue ; and
from these we have the feathers with the outer web entirely
*white.
The bill is wholly black, rather long and slim, straight,
\0x25A0compressed, not toothed, but with the upper mandible strongly
hooked, and at the nostrils higher than it is broad. No rictal
bristles to speak of. Nostrils rather forward, uncovered, slightly
*oval, open, and at the end of a groove. Inside of mouth bright
yellow, inclining to orange ; eyes hazel brown. Legs long, and,
with the toes and claws, wholly black. Centre toe with its claw
slightly longer than hind toe and claw, the two side toes being
(c). It would be more correct to say of many of these feathers that the black and
the concealed white run up to the top of the shaft, and that, from the tip of the shaft,
there springs a fan-shaped projection of purplish blue with a mesial tip of silvery gray or
.light blue.--K. P.

short, inner shortest. Toes stout, the claws being very stout
and sickle-shaped. Tail unusually boat-shaped, but nearly
square at the end ; before the moult it was quite square. Before
the moult, also, the head was very little spotted, the chin and
throat hai&apos;dly at all. Total length about ioj inches, of which
perhaps the tail was barely 4. The foregoing particulars are the
result of three examinations made before the moult, and are
as correct as I could obtain them ; but to examine a living and
valued bird is a very different matter from examining an
inanimate skin.
On May 3 ,1 transferred Bob from the house to the garden,
and made a fourth examination, this time when the moult was
nearly but not quite over, and the plumage a little deceptive.
On that day, the feathers from the centre of the crown, running
down the back of the neck and spreading out over the mantle,
were deep black like the lores ; and there was a little black on
the chin and on the base of the forehead. Since, however, the
black feathers from the crown to the mantle seem more or less to
have developed the blue ends and glistening tips. The head and
throat are now profusely tipped, as are practically the entire fore
parts of the body, above and below, lores excepted, the external
aspect of most of the bird being purplish blue, with the head
neck back and breast smeared over with these shining tips,
slanting from the bill tailwards. In some lights the appearance
is as if the head, neck, mantle, and breast had been well rubbed
down with grease. The frequent apparent changes are very
aggravating, for to-day (June 28) the bird's breast looks as if it
were black mottled with bright light-blue.
On the last examination, the feathers across the breast
with concealed white centres were not, I think, so concentrated,
but seemed more scattered, appearing on the lower breast; and the
tail feathers above were more blue, having only a little edging of
black along the inner webs. The under tail-coverts were bright
purplish blue, and the under wing-coverts seemed to be mostly
blue; but a few were white or tipped with white, forming a
crescent. A line of lighter and brighter blue runs across the
forehead, and the same along each side of the crown ; and since
the beginning of June a distinct patch of the same light blue has
been visible on the lesser coverts. All the flights seemed to be
dusky black, with the exposed parts of the outer webs purplish
blue,--but perhaps not extending to the points of the wing,
which look black. First primary 2^ inches long, 4-6 longest
but I am not sure that all the flights were fully grown on May 3.

Before the moult, Bob had been netted and his wings cut,
and he was cowed and allowed me to examine him pretty freely;
but by May 3 he had ceased to fear me, and he seemed to think
that I was going to cut his wings again, and when handled on
that day fought like a demon ; and it was impossible, without
incurring a great risk of injuring him, to look at the feathers
under my two hands, or to make any but the most hurried
examination of the concealed markings.
As to the tail, on the first three examinations it consisted
of but eleven feathers. These feathers were short and absurdly
narrow. At first incessantly, and still occasionally when nervous,
he springs open and shuts his tail-feathers like a fan ; as my
bird-woman said one day, " He's uncommon busy with his tail."
With the narrow feathers, the effect was that, when open, they
all were separated like the extended and parted fingers of the
human hand, and the tail looked contemptible. I examined the
feathers, and failed to detect any sign of fracture or exceptional
abrasion, each feather being well rounded at the tip. After a
while, a twelfth feather grew, an outside feather, much broader
and about one quarter of an inch longer than every other feather.
Then the eleven feathers were cast in moult, and, after a few
days' delay, also the new No. 12. An entirely new tail now made
its appearance, one inch or more longer than the former tail,
each feather being about double the width of the first eleven.
On May 3, the outer feather on each side was fully one inch
shorter than the others. O11 June 28, I noticed that one
(I cannot speak of the other) of these two feathers was still
abnormally short ; but doubtless this was nothing more than
the result of some little mischief set up in connection with the
irregular growth of the No. 12 feather of the first tail.
An interesting feature in the new tail was that, when the
bird was handled on May 3, it was found that the shaft of
every one of the twelve feathers extended distinctly and clearly
beyond the webbing. The new tail, too, seems less square and
rather inclined to be indented in the centre.
Keeping a bird in a cage by itself, as Bob was during the
winter, has one advantage--the feathers cast in the moult can be
collected and preserved. The bulk of Bob's old plumage has been
preserved ; and recently I have been looking over the feathers.
None of the twelve tail feathers shews a distinct shaft spike ;
but it is possible that these may have been worn away, though
hardly on the new No. 12. I found what I was not looking for,
and had never noticed before, a few small feathers wholly brown

<bodyText confidence="0.998858488372093" page_id="10098751"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
and others with brown bases. One curious feather was brown
with a concealed centre of light yellow-brown. Two of the
brown feathers seemed to belong to the innermost scapulars, and
probably the others came from the same region.
Before the moult, Bob's little tail was conspicuously out
of proportion to the size of the bird. I flattered myself that this
short tail was a special provision of nature to enable him to
squeeze into holes without detriment or inconvenience. The
enlarged size of the new tail seemed to squash my little theory,
but, on consideration, I do not know that it does. What are
these produced shaft ends for ? Surely not for ornament, but for
some practical use. For the immature bird, the short tail will
suffice ; but the adult, with its family to provide for, would need
greater powers of general movement, which the full tail would
furnish ; and may not the shaft ends have been provided as a
protection for the longer feathers, to protect the ends from
abrasion when in the tree hollows ?
Bob's legs are long, and he holds his head high, and seems
to be continually on the look out. For about three weeks he was
loose in the aviary, and, during that time, would instantly
disappear on the slightest sound. No hole or crevice seemed too
small for him to creep into. And when in hiding the plumage
seems to absorb every ray of light, leaving the bird almost
invisible. When shut up in a four-foot cage in a corner of the
rather dull-liglited birdroom, but directly facing the window, I
found that I could rarely see him. On one occasion, I was so
absolutely certain that he was not in the cage that I opened the
large folding doors and thrust my head and shoulders in to
examine and see where he had broken through, but he was on
the top perch in a corner of the cage all the time. L,ater on I
found that I could best discover him by looking along the
lighter-coloured perch for the black toes. When in hiding, he
will not move a muscle or a feather, so that one could open the
door and attend to his cage as readily as if it had been empty.
Bob is a leopard in bird's clothing. It seems to be the nature of
the bird thus to lurk in holes and dark corners, not alone for the
purpose of concealment from his foes, but also to lie in ambush
for unsuspecting prey that may approach or be enticed within
range of his spring. When hiding for concealment, the white
flank tufts are covered ; but, when lying in ambush, the white
downy feathers are often visible in the form of a little fan, each
tuft having the appearance of a moth with extended wings as
when at rest on the inner side of a tree-hollow, the bird himself

being invisible ; and doubtless he thus lures insectivorous birds
to their fate. It may be that these tufts are used also forcourtin
purposes. The feathers of the hind neck he often raises like
mane.
Bob seems to be of arboreal habits, and keeps much to
the perches, bounding about with great power and spring. He
has a curious way, which I have not noticed quite the same in
any other species, of " taking a header " when he wants to go
down, which he does without a flutter or sound. The boat-
shaped tail probably helps him to execute this movement, which
I suspect enables him to catch unsuspecting prey below. When
on the ground, where he seldom remains long, he will hop and
take short runs, but never walk.

NESTING OF THE LEADBEATER COCKATOO.

By Mrs. Johnstone.
It is with much pleasure that I send an account of the
nesting of the Leadbeater Cockatoo, in my aviary this summer.
The old birds commenced hunting for a suitable nesting
hole early in April. All the birds in this aviary had been out
the entire winter.
In the aviary are two rotten trees, about eight feet high ;
they are entirely rotten inside, and much exposed to wind and
rain. The Cockatoos took a great fancy to one, and, knowing it
was useless to allow them to nest in it as it was, I had it boarded
up on the open side, leaving a sufficiently large hole for them to
use, near the top, with a drop inside of about two feet. It made
a most excellent nesting-place in their opinion, for they were in
and out of the hole the day it was finished.
The other tree, treated in a similar way, was seized upon
by a beautiful pair of Rock Pepler Parrakeets. I say " seized,"
as I never saw such keen competition amongst the various
Parrakeets; it was, apparently, perfection in their opinion.
I cannot say how many eggs the hen Leadbeater laid, but
she sat very closely for over three weeks, and then one day I saw
her off her nest, and, to my surprise, she did not return to it for
some hours. On approaching the tree, I could hear the young
birds moving about. They made a curious hissing noise, and
were evidently quite conscious of the approach of danger. The
cock bird spent all his time eating decayed wood from a
neighbouring stump ; he fed the hen, who in her turn fed the
bo rt

young ones. I should say the young Readbeaters were brought
up almost entirely on this diet.
One Friday, about three weeks after, I believe, they were
hatched, a splendid young bird appeared, nearly as big as his
parents, and a picture of beauty. On the following Sunday
another emerged from the hole, and the following Tuesday yet
another.
They were all perfectly fledged and looked rather like
lovely pink Owls. I cannot say whether they are cocks or hens,
as I cannot get near enough to see their eyes. They look just
like the parent birds, only pinker, softer, and more babyish
looking. The two old birds will not allow another bird to go
near them.
As I write (July and) they fly perfectly, but perching is
still a difficulty. The parents fly anxiously after them and
superintend every step in their education.
I must add that the Rock Pepler Parrakeet laid four eggs,
about the same time as the Readbeater, but finding they did not
hatch I have taken them away.
I believe this is the first time the Readbeater Cockatoo has
bred, and the Rock Pepler Parrakeet laid, in this country (&lt;/).
THE NESTING OF THE ANDAMAN STARLING.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
The higher up we get the more we are watched--the
rooster on the church steeple is of more consequence (although
he is tin) than the rooster in the barnyard. I feel rather like the
church rooster at having to chronicle another success. All the
same I cannot but feel that I deserve my triumph, for though
Fortune sometimes shows us the way, it is energy that achieves
success. Fortune never takes anybody by the hand, but she
often allows them to take her by the hand ; and opportunities are
made quite as often as they happen.
I might begin this paper after the manner of Rord
Macaulay, " Fvery schoolboy knows the position of the Andaman
Islands." I frankly confess I was not in the position of that
(, d ). The Rock Pepler would seem to have laid on a previous occasion ; see my note,
p. 175. In "Notes on Cage Birds," a reprint from the Bazaar , in book form of Notes relat-
ing to Cage Birds, edited by Dr. Greene, at page 193, " M " says, " In my outdoor aviary I
have a hen Rock Pepler now sitting on three eggs laid on the ground." Why the proprietor
of the Bazaar would not permit (so I was informed) the dates and names of the writers of
the " Notes " to appear, I do not know; if these had been supplied, the book would be
treble its present value.--R.P.

omniscient young prig; as I had to ask where they were, like
Rosa Dartle, " simply for the sake of information." I found on
consulting a map that the Andaman Islands are in the Bay of
Bengal, not far from the Nicobar group, whence, I suppose come
the Nicobar Pigeons.
Andaman Starlings are, I believe, exceedingly rare.
Beside my own pair, I have only seen one other; an aged cock
in the possession of our member for York, Mr. W. E. Stevens.
As, therefore, the majority of the Avicultural Society will be no
wiser for the name, I will briefly describe the birds.
The Andaman Starling is a particularly graceful and natty
bird with greenish black wings and tail, a brownish dash on the
rump, a snowy waistcoat and head ; yellow beak, blue at the
base ; yellow understandings, and ' pearl ' eyes. It would be
difficult to imagine a more striking bird, and visitors always
admire them immensely. The lieu may be distinguished from the
cock by her slightly grayer back and more slender and
feminine build. I know of no other distinction.
Andamans are very tame and friendly birds, and by no
means afraid of us humans. Mine will come within a yard of me
at any time, and give their peculiar call note.
I one day received a letter from a dealer offering me a pair
of Andaman Starlings, and telling me to look alive if I wanted
them. Members of the Society who know me in the past will
have no difficulty in guessing my answer; and a few days later
the Andamans were ' at home' at Micklefield Vicarage. For the
time, as the weather was bad, I put them into an indoor aviary
in the birdroom, and they soon made themselves happy. They
have two great weaknesses--tubbing and cockroaches. They
are always ready to apply water to their outer man and black
clocks to their inner. Fortunately I can gratify the latter
craving, as our kitchen fairly lifts with cockroaches.
We find them here, we find them there,
We find these beetles everywhere.
to parody an obituary notice often appearing in the " Yorkshire
Post."
With the advent of warmer weather I enlarged the
Andamans into a big garden aviary, in company with a pair
of Turquoisines. In the inner aviary there were three logs
intended for Parrakeet breeding. No. i was taken possession of
by the Turquoisines, No. 2 by the Andamans, as also No. 3 at a
later period. That my readers may understand the situation
fully, I may say in passing that the neighbours on one side were

<bodyText confidence="0.994732487804878" page_id="10098755"  page_num="194" year="" vol="">
a pair of Pagoda Mynahs, and the other a pair of American
Mocking-birds. All these have raised families, so you may
guess I have had my hands full.
As the summer drew on, the Andamans soon showed that
they intended to increase and multiply, and replenish the earth.
I one morning saw one of them carrying a straw into the
central log; so I took the hint and supplied some nice likely
nesting material. They soon took the hint, and from time to
time I saw an oddment of straw sticking out of the hole, so that
I knew that things were going merrily as the proverbial marriage
bell. If I showed any undue interest by looking at the log from
a distance, a warning note was soon uttered, which sounded
very like that 'wicked little cuss word' Frenchmen are so fond
of-- sacre --very much drawn out. The hen only did the sitting,
and, as far as I could tell, she sat about thirteen days. No doubt
readers of an enquiring turn of mind will want to know what
the pretty eggs were like. I regret that I can furnish no
information on this point, as I knew that to look would be as
much as the nest was worth ; and later, as events proved, the
colour of the eggs was put beyond my power to guess, as they
all hatched. If, as is the usual custom, the egg shells were
carried out, I never had the luck to find them, as no doubt they were
dropped in the long coarse grass, and so escaped my notice ( e ).
The youngsters were fed assiduously by both parents, they rose
early and late took rest; but they did not carry out the Davidic
maxim, by " eating the bread of carefulness," for they evidently
believed that the good of all the land of Egypt was theirs. The
way mealworms disappeared was a caution to rattlesnakes !
Guide books tell us that mealworms are too 'stimulating/
that if so fed, sooner or later the unnatural parents throw their
unhappy offspring out of the nest and begin nesting again. I
often think of those words of Mrs. Glegg in "The Mill on the
Floss." " Mr. Tulliver doesn't want to hear your opinion or
mine neither. There's folks in this world as know better than
everybody else." That is my candid opinion of the advocates of
non-mealworm treatment. I have had a fairly large experience
and no mean measure of success, and I say without hesitation
that I owe it all to disregarding such advice and following the
teaching of Nature.
(e). Since the above was written the Andamans have gone to nest again. I have
examined the eggs. They are deepish blue in colour, long and oval in shape.--C. D. F.

At first the Andamans went about their domestic duties
with a beautiful disregard to privacy ; but as the days went on
and the young began to lift up their voices, the parents grew
worried and anxious, and if I happened to enter at feeding-
time, I could hear them say ' shush ' as plainly as we should say
it ourselves if we wanted a youngster to be cpiiet. The cock was
often called to order for being, I take it, too venturesome ; and
I notice to this day that, when engaged in domestic duties, ' he
treads delicately,' like Agag.
Feeding commenced pretty early in the morning, so I
always left a good supply of grub over night. Hour after hour
throughout the day provender was carried to those hungry little
mouths that were always, like Oliver Twist, 'asking for more.'
All the time I was in blank ignorance as to the number of
my new family. I ventured to think there might be two, but it
was only a blind guess. All I knew was that, if these birds were
to be reared--whether many or few--they must have all they
asked for. I may here note, in passing, that the excreta, after
the first few days, were carried out to the very end of the aviary
and deposited on the woodwork ; and it was by looking at their
size that I daily learnt how affairs were going on within that log
of mystery. For the first few days the excreta were swallowed
by the parents.
On Saturday, July ist, No. i youngster made its appearance
fully fledged. Three others followed on Sunday : or rather, to
be correct, two flew out, and one popped its head out of the log;
so now I knew that my patience had been rewarded and that I
was the proud and happy possessor of four young Andaman
Starlings.
The youngsters have the black on their wings beautifully
laced with white, their waistcoats are snowy, their tails greyish,
their beaks pinkish, as also their legs; and their eyes are the
same as their parents. They have a grey mark down the back of
the head, where the parents are white.
It is such a pretty sight to see the old birds feeding. The
youngsters sit on the ground or on a branch, and as they open
their beaks with a little shudder of pleasure, the old one runs at
them and pops not one but half-a-dozen mealworms into its
mouth. You wonder where they have all gone to. Feeding
begins at daybreak and ends about 6.30, when 110 doubt the
parents have had enough of it.

As I stand and look at these four youngsters my feelings
are of the kind known as ' indescribable ; ' for human happiness
consists in having what you want, and wanting what you have ;
and I believe firmly with the immortal Josh Billings ' that it is a
darned sight easier tew find six men who ken tell exactly how a
thing ought tew be did than tew find one who can do it.'

Sir, --I have just come across a "Penny Magazine" for 1834, and
extracted from a letter therein as follows :
" The Grey Parrot, like many others of its tribe, often lives to a great
age, and we are told of individuals attaining to 50 or 60 years, or over 100
years. According to Le Valliant, one which lived in the family of Mr.
Meninck Huysir, at Amsterdam, for 32 years, had previously passed 41 with
that gentleman's uncle, who bequeathed it to his nephew.When
Le Valliant saw it, the bird was in a state of decrepitude.At the
age of 60 its memory began to fail. It moulted regularly once a year until
the age of 65, when the red feathers of the tail were supplied by&apos; yellow
ones, after which no other change of plumage took place."
As some thousands of Grey Parrots have been imported since that
time, has a similar case ever been known, or would the above account
be an exceptional instance of change of colour in the tail ?

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Experiences are generally very like cheroots ; they usually
begin badly, taste perfect half-way through, and at the butt-end
are things to be thrown away and never picked up again. My
experience, however, this time is a distinct exception, for it was
happy in the beginning, middle, and end.
It generally takes me a couple of seasons to get a
satisfactory pair ; and in the case of the Pagodas there was the
usual wait. I first of all got hold of a good cock, and then I
began to look about for a mate. This proved no easy task. I
wrote to that refuge of the destitute, the late Mr. Abrahams, and
he sent me what he said was a ' certain ' hen. I was not so sure;
but I did not like to contradict so old a fancier. Time, however,
proved that I was right and that he was wrong ; for the so-called
hen was a cock and soon showed its sex by battles royal with his
fellow prisoner. In these combats one of the contending parties
was slain, and, as it was winter, I did not bother any more for the
time. This spring, after Easter, I popped up to London for the
inside of a week ; and, of course, visited all the bird shops. At
Mr. Hamlyn's I found, on my second visit, a pair of Pagoda
Mynahs just come in off the boat; and, as they looked all right,
I bought them ; but let them stop with my other purchases until
the week-end, when I transferred the lot to Yorkshire.
They appeared to feel the cold a bit at first, but in a week
or two seemed to get accustomed to constant changes of
temperature. I kept them in a bird room until spring was over,
and then I put them out into what I call a beautiful outdoor
aviary; but what my family call ' the Stores.' Here they soon
settled down in company with a pair of Red-headed Indian
Buntings and a pair of Red-vented Bulbuls. I rigged up a box
near the roof, in the same place as the Malabar Mynahs nested

last season. It was not long before they took the hint, and went
to work at nest building. The nest was composed of little sticks
(as I found on examination after the young ones had flown) and
was a very flimsy affair. The cock and hen took it by turns to
sit; but I think they took certain watches, and not day and
night spells. I am unable to say what the eggs were like, as
they all hatched out, and I was not so foolish as to touch the
nest until the young had flown ( a ).
The sitting lasted roughly some 13 days; and the first
intimation I had of 'new arrivals' was by seeing one of the
parents with a small mealworm in its beak with which (by
careful and unobtrusive watching) I saw it go aloft. Pagodas
are very fond of fresh ants' eggs, especially for the early days of
rearing ; whereas the Andamans would hardly look at them.
The difference in taste in birds is very curious.
After about a week I began to hear the voices of the
young, and day by day the noise grew more and more uproarious.
The Pagoda parents were the shyest of feeders after the first
week. I could never catch them at it, watch as I might. For
the first week they did not mind me a bit. The Andamans, on
the other hand, were very shy at first, and got bolder as the days
went by.
Can the readers of the ' Avicultural ' realize what it meant
to rear Mocking-birds, Andamans, and Pagodas all side by side?
Mr. Phillipps wrote to me quite pathetically. ' No wonder
mealworms are so scarce and dear ! '
At the end of about a fortnight, or perhaps a little longer,
I could see the youngsters at the mouth of the hole, and the} 7
seemed to feel the heat very much, as they kept their beaks open.
About ten days later, I saw No. 1 sitting on the top of a box
tree in the open run. Nos. 2 and 3 followed the next morning.
Here again the Pagodas differed from the Andamans: for
whereas the young Pagodas flew straight out of doors, the young
Andamans remained inside for nearly a week before venturing
out of doors. Every night the young Pagodas came home to
sleep, and generally passed the night 011 the top of the nest-box,
but they were out of doors all day long.
For the benefit of my readers who do not know the
Pagoda I append a brief description :
In size they are rather smaller than an English Starling,
very trim and lightly made. The head has a beautiful sweeping
{a). I took a second sitting- laid by the Pagoda ; the eggs are small and blue like a
Starling's.--C. D. F.

feet yellow.
There were, as I said, three youngsters ; they are brown
little things, with jackdaw eyes ; a black spot on the crown where
the crest will be some day ; yellow beaks, but no blue on them
so far, and pink feet.
I have had both them and the Andamans specially photo-
graphed, and I only hope that the Society will see its way to
publish these pretty groups.
They say that confession is good for the soul ; therefore
let me end with one. If men are honest, they will tell you that
their success in life is more of a wonder to them than it is to

A FEW GORGEOUSLY-COLOURED FOREIGN
-CAGE BIRDS.
By A. Savage.
Ever since I have kept foreign birds, at this time of the
</table>

year, when in their gorgeous plumage, I have always been
struck with Weaver-birds and a desire to possess a few. But
the bad character given them in most books on foreign birds has
prevented me from purchasing the various varieties generally
imported. However, I could not resist the temptation any
longer, and last month I bought a cock bird of each of the
following : Oryx or Grenadier Weaver-bird, Orange Bishop,
Napoleon Weaver-bird, Madagascar Weaver-bird, Nonpareil-
finch, and an Indigo-bird ; intending to keep them, by themselves,
in a large cage in the dining-room, to enjoy the sight of the
brilliant plumage of this little collection.
The idea did not work ; I had reckoned without taking
into consideration " the hand that rocks the cradle and rules the
world," and the possessor of that hand pronounced the large
cage in the dining-room a nuisance (from want of space), and the
birds had to be turned into the aviary with the collection of
various other kinds already there.
When I made the purchase, with the exception of the
Nonpareil and the Indigo, the birds were off colour, in their
hen-Sparrow garb, and consequently bought at cheap prices ;
but the few coloured feathers which were appearing on all of

them announced they were cocks, and that their gorgeous
plumage was only a question of a few weeks.
From the bad character Weaver-birds are usually branded
with, I expected ructions in the aviary as they came into full
plumage, but, although they are now nearly in their full Summer
attire, I have not noticed any serious disturbance (#). The Indigo
certainly can't stand the Nonpareil in too familiar closeness, so
the Nonpareil moves off a little, and there is an end of the
matter; and the Orange Bishop is just a bit fussy, but that is all
the disturbance I have noticed. So far, the Oryx, Madagascar,
and Napoleon are model aviary companions. I shall, never-
theless, keep an eye on all, and if they do turn out rough, later,
they will be removed to other quarters. It is true, I have only
male birds of each kind, and they might not be so well behaved
if they were in pairs.
Weaver-birds are frugal livers, and will live pretty well on
seed alone, but as green food and ants' eggs are always in the
aviary where they are, they may eat a little of both--anyway the
food is at their disposal " si le cceur leur en dit,"--the Nonpareil
and Indigo p&apos;robably do partake of it.
Weaver-birds have no song to boast of. So far I have not
heard a sound from the Napoleon ; the Madagascar has a lively
chirp; the Oryx is continually treating us to his song, the
commencement of which is not too bad, but he generally ends
with a sound resembling steam escaping through a cracked
steampipe or defective steam tap; the Orange Bishop seems to
limit his song to the steampipe note alone.
To anybody wishing to have a small collection of birds of
handsome plumage, in a cage in a house, or under a verandah, I
can recommend those I mention ; they are sure to attract the
admiration of all who see them, and their brilliant plumage is
seen better in a cage, all together in close quarters, than in a
large aviary. _
THE COMMON SWIFT.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
My own experience of an adult Swift mentioned in Vol.
III. of " British Birds with their nests and eggs " is the only
recorded instance which I have met with of an attempt to keep
this bird in captivity. The bird there mentioned only lived for
(b). If Mr. Savage will introduce a Black-headed Weaver, or almost any species
of Hyphaniornis or Ploceus into his community, he will have an opportunity pretty speedily
of proving the truth of the aspersions on their character.--A. G. B.

three days. On the 16th July of the present year a little girl
brought a young Swift to my wife : it had evidently left the nest
before it was fully able to fly (the feathers of the under parts not
having grown sufficiently to cover the centre of the breast and
abdomen), and in the ordinary course of events would inevitably
have become the prey of some marauding cat.
On my return home in the evening my wife showed me
the bird, and remembering how successful I had been some years
since in rearing a Pied Wagtail upon a mixture of crushed sweet
biscuit and Abrahams' Insectivorous Food, I proposed that the
Swift should be fed upon the same mixture.
Having left the nest, the bird naturally refused to open
its mouth ; so that, for a fortnight my wife (who undertook to be
chief nurse) was obliged to open its mouth for it for every morsel.
I fortunately had an opportunity of securing some fresh wasp-
grubs which varied the food for a few days and formed the first
inducement to the bird to feed itself: the idea of finding the
food when it was hungry, nevertheless did not seem to occur to
the Swift, however hungry it might be, so--about every two
hours, the food and water had to be offered before it would
attempt to eat or drink.
Between meals, and at night, the Swift was kept in a
wicker basket with flannel to keep it warm ; but it strongly
objected to being shut up, and whenever the lid was opened it
would scramble up the side and fly either to the person who
happened to be nearest or to the floor. If on the floor it would
run at a great rate to anybody who called it. Like the House
Martins which I reared in 1891, the Swift took great pleasure in
nestling down in one's hand, where it would remain quietly
making the queer sizzling sort of purring sound which this bird
always utters when feeding, and which at times, when the bird is
excited in flight, develops into quite a shrill scream. Another
favourite position was--clinging to my wife's or servant's dress
near the shoulder, or hanging between the folds of the table-cloth.
Although we caught a good many flies for our Swift, and
it seemed to eat the soft mixture with pleasure and digested it
without difficulty, I am afraid it did not get sufficient exercise to
keep it in vigorous health. After a meal we could make it active
by placing it in the basket and leaving the lid open ; then as it
scrambled up the side and flew off it was repeatedly put back
until it had, as we supposed, had enough exercise for the time ;
but it seems to me that a bird which naturally spends a greater
part of the day on the wing, taking its food incessantly in small

instalments, can hardly be expected to flourish when fed heavily
at long intervals and only then able to take exercise.
During the night of August 14th my wife woke up and
took it into her head to go downstairs and have a look at the
Swift: it had been especially active the night before, but she
found it in a very feeble condition, cold, and unable to attempt
to feed. She warmed it in her hands, gave it a little water to
drink, and when it began to utter its little monotonous note she
gave it a morsel of food. It is still alive as I write, though un-
doubtedly not likely to live over the day (V).
To keep a Swift in captivity for a month is, I think, a
triumph ; but I do not recommend any bird-lover, unless he act
from feelings of humanity (as my wife has done) to attempt to
rear from the nest either Swifts or Swallows ; they are affectionate
and lovable birds, but their life in captivity must, of necessity, be
short. I believe, under favourable conditions, with a properly
constructed cage and plenty of insect-food all these birds, might
be kept, but they are far better at liberty.

A SUPPOSED NEW WHISTLING-BIRD.

fContinued from page iqi).
For a time, as I have already said, I left him loose in my
mixed aviary, for he seemed amiable and peaceable ; in truth,
he never quarrelled with the birds, but--when he wanted fresh
meat for dinner, he helped himself. A man does not quarrel
with his flocks and herds, but he eats them nevertheless when he
finds it convenient to do so. He was so terribly shy and anxious
to hide that his real nature did not immediately betray itself.
One by one a few small birds disappeared, and my suspicions
were aroused. O11 hearing any sound of alarm, I would rush
into the aviary, in time to pick up a warm corpse more or less
mangled but not to see the murderer. Each body had been
ripped open from the vent, and the soft parts attacked. I felt
that Bob must be the culprit, so, with the keenest regret, cut his
wings. But the murders continued ; so I again cut the wings,
this time so short that he ought to have been helpless ; and I
supposed that I should be able to drive him into one of the large
cages and shut him up at night or whenever I might desire.
(c). It died that evening.--A. G. B.

Vain hope ! so far as my aviary and birdroom were concerned,
Bob was independent of wings, and without difficulty bounded
np to the highest perches like some spring-heeled Jack ; and as
to driving him into a cage at nightfall, I found that I just
couldn't do it, and so had to leave him loose all night. At day-
break on the following morning, I crept down stairs to the bird-
room. Some of the birds were still in bed, some waking up and
stretching themselves, others attending to their morning toilet,
while several little fellows were already on the feed. And Bob ?
Hidden away in a quiet corner, Bob was standing as motionless
as if he had been in a glass case in one of the galleries at the
Museum ; and not a bird seemed to be within his reach. Softly
I closed the door on the peaceful scene, and faced bedwards, but
had not mounted two steps when the Alarm ! was sounded by a
chorus of throats. I rushed back, and found Bob some yards
away from where I had left him but a few seconds previously,
killing and ripping open a bird. " Killing" is hardly the word,
for death must have been instantaneous. Bob was digging the
claw of the hind toe of the right foot with great power and
determination into the body of the bird. If you watch a man
digging heavy ground, he will force the spade into the ground
with all the strength of the fully extended outstretched right
leg. So was Bob, with his right leg extended, digging his hind
claw, with intense earnestness and decision, into the body of his
hapless victim, and simultaneously was ripping it open from the
vent.
Thus did Bob throw away his last opportunity of leading
a freer and a better life He was immediately netted and shut
up ; and he passed the winter months in a six-foot cage in my
dining-room. There I several times saw him use his right leg in
a way similar to that described, proving to my mind that to do
so is the natural instinct of the bird. When I have placed a
cockroach trap in the cage, I have repeatedly seen him dart at a
cockroach and simultaneously attempt to dig the hind claw of
one foot, I think always the right, into the body of the trap.
Sometimes, too, when fiddling a martial air, he would work
himself up into a state of frenzy, and would dart at some imagi-
nary bird on a neighbouring perch--never on the ground--which
he would instantaneously and simultaneously kill with his heel
and rip up with his bill : it is part of the ingrained nature of the
bird.
We always, I think, associate a Thrush in our mind with
an innocent songster, and therefore the name of Whistling-
Thrush commonly applied to the genus seems incongruous. In

saying this I am supposing that all the species of the genus
Myiophoneus are rapacious like the subject under consideration,
but on this point I am without information. I have not often
kept a true Shrike, and do not know if they, or any of them, kill
their prey with only the hind claw in the manner I have
described ; but it seems to me that Bob is more nearly allied in
his habits, although not in build and movements, to the Shrikes
than to the Thrushes. In shape he is rather Chat-like, in some
of his movements very Robin-like ; he holds up his head, and
will occasionally jerk up his tail and take a short run ( d ), remark-
ably like our Robin Redbreast, and promises before long to assert
himself with all Cock Robin's boldness and confidence. The
name " Whistling-Shrike," therefore, would be inadmissible ;
but "Whistling-Bird" would suit well enough, and the mis-
leading word " Thrush" would thus be avoided. I have noticed
but one Thrusli-like habit in my bird, and that is hammering
stones, &amp;c., against the bottom of his cage. Occasionally I have
succeeded in getting a snail for him, and the shells of these he
smashed by banging them about rather than against any special
stone ; so far he has always devoured the snails. Some cotton
reels in his cage he would sometimes bang against the floor with
such violence as to be heard half over the house.
When we consider the manner in which he kills a bird,
we might suppose that he would hold his food down with one or
both feet while pecking at it. But this is not the case. I have
never seen him do so except on the one occasion when he was
detected whilst actually engaged in killing a bird. It I give him
any food of any kind, say a bone to pick, and he used to like a
pheasant or chicken bone, or even that of a mutton chop, he
picks at it as if he considered that the bone ought to be fixed,
but never touches it with his foot. Perchance in his wild state
he would, Slirike-like, fix his prey on to a thorn or spike of some
kind, and would then be able to pick at it to some purpose.
At page 2 of Vol. VII. of the Catalogue, Dr. Bowdler
Sharpe seems inclined to find fault with Mr. Seebohm for having
excluded this (and other) species from the Thrushes ( T21rdid.cE).
I do not understand that the young of Myiophoneus have the
spotted plumage of the Turdidce; and probably Mr. Seebohm
was not far wrong in excluding them.
On May 3, Bob was transferred to a house I had had built
for him in the garden aviary, consisting of a sheltered inner
( d ). Not strictly correct as regards the " run " of the Robin ; the Blackbird on the
lawn might be more accurate.--R. P.

chamber about four feet, and an outer flight nearly eight feet,
high. In order to clean either division, it is considered desir-
able to drive him into the other, for the doors are large, and he
is now a brazen-faced Bob, and hides himself only on the appear-
ance of strangers. But Bob was perverse, and would not allow
himself to be driven from the outer chamber, which consequently
had to remain uncleaned for some days. On May 9, I decided
that such open rebellion and defiant disobedience was bad for the
discipline of the establishment, and that Bob must be brought
to book forthwith. Our bird-woman having brought all her
things ready, I told her to look out, and produced from under
the flap of my coat a short-handled bird-net; " Oh where --?

woman, staring all about the larger outer aviary to see what had
become of Bob who, on the production of the net, had " melted
into air, into thin air, and . . . left not a rack behind."
Trained as my eyes had been all my life to watch birds and
animals, in olden days an expert shot and a good cricketer, I
should have deemed it impossible for a bird as large as a pigeon
to have dropped down perpendicularly about three feet, and then
to have darted off at a right angle to get under his shed, without
being seen ; but so it was. We were within a few feet and had
our eyes on him, and yet his movement was so rapid that our
eyes had been unable to take it in and detect it. The upper part
of the outward extension, where the bird was, is constructed
entirely of wire-netting, and the woman thought he had burst
clean through and had fled off. I knew that that was impos-
sible ; but I must confess that I felt very " creepy," and scanned
the outer division of his house most carefully, before I cautiously
and nervously opened the door. Bob is a wise bird in his genera-
tion, for since that day he has obeyed orders with alacrity, and it
has not again been necessary to produce the net for the same
purpose.
When transferred to the garden, Bob at first set himself to
catch the birds which came near his house; but he quickly saw
that it couldn't be done, and for some weeks seemed to think no
more about them. The only bird of whom he took any notice
was an immature male Regent (Sericulus mclhius), whose pre-
sence he invariably recognises with a lively chattering, some-
times like that of the Missel-Thrush when its young are
approached, but whether a chattering of peace or war I did not
for some time know. They are both loquacious ; and I thought
that perhaps each recognised in the other a kindred spirit, or
possibly a rival for vocal honours. Nevertheless I regarded it

206

<bodyText confidence="0.999710534883721" page_id="10098767"  page_num="206" year="" vol="">
as ominous that the "kissing" should have been so one-sided, for
the Regent never returned the salute. Slowly but surely Bob is
becoming civilized, and is losing his native habits and customs.
Bight months and more of close confinement, with nothing to
do but to eat, drink, and grow fat, is enough to spoil any bird.
It is almost a calamity that he should be thus confined, for he is
a very active bird, and requires much more exercise than he can
now enjoy.
His voice is hardly correctly described as a whistle.
Every now and then he comes out with a soft and gentle song,
like some of the notes of the Redbreast. Sometimes he descends
the scale to a series of guttural croaks. Altogether his voice
approaches nearest to the music of the violin. Perhaps Bob
would tell us, if he were asked, that the guttural notes are those
of his native violoncello. The name of Fiddling-bird, or The
Fiddler, would suit him well. Whilst in the house, his varied
music gave us great pleasure ; but now he is in the garden it is
almost lost in the din and babel of a mixed aviary. He has
several little notes, such as the chuckle of approval, the plaintive
twittering and dog-like whine of anxiety or want, the prolonged
high pitched call-note, and the like, some of them very expres-
sive. The gurgling notes seem to be the war or hunting notes,
as at any rate they are occasionally used when he is in hot pur-
suit, like a terrier giving tongue when it starts a rabbit.
Bob is not delicate for a foreign bird, but he does not like
cold, and rarely takes a bath except in fairly warm weather.
Occasionally he will take an uneasy sun bath; nevertheless,
civilized as he has now become, he seems irresistibly drawn to
his highest lookout perch or to the darkest corner of his den.
Since he has been shut up I have experienced some diffi-
culty in feeding him satisfactorily. I cannot reconcile myself to
the thought of giving him birds, and insectivorous food he will
hardly look at. When I purchased him, he had absolutely
nothing in his cage but raw meat. This is too heavy as a regular
diet ; and I now feed him principally on scraped cooked meat
and a general mixture, with occasional treats of carefully scraped
raw meat, and such insects as I can obtain. Occasionally he will
take a garden worm ; mealworms I find may only be given with
caution. Just now and then he will take a bit of fruit as medi-
cine. For a while he seemed to be going wrong; so lately I
have taken to driving the other birds into the bird-room, and
then letting him out for a fly. This has quite restored him ;
and it has also re-awakened in him his thirst for blood, which I

had hoped might have been allayed. As quick as thought he
was in a hole, and as nearly as possible caught a sitting Nutmeg
Finch, whose nest I had been unacquainted with ; and only the
immediate production of the net averted a catastrophe. Every
time he is let out, he carefully overhauls all the nesting boxes.
For the first three or four outings, I did not trouble to drive a
few of the larger birds out of the aviary. I found, and it is
suggestive, that, when he had had a good supply of raw meat
on the previous day, he troubled himself but little about the
other birds, but that when the raw meat (and nothing would take
its place) had not been supplied, he was most murderously in-
clined, attacking even such a powerful bird as the Green Oriole
(Oriolus viridisJ ; and an unfortunate Pied Rock-Thrush, who
one day had hidden away instead of seeking the shelter of the
birdroom, was unearthed and nearly disposed of notwithstanding
my immediate rush with the net. Bob went after him with as
deadly a purpose as a female Sparrow-Hawk just off her nest in
the evening would have done. His powers of flight seemed to
be infinitely greater than that of the Thrush ; and the latter ex-
hibited little of the clever dodging that I should credit the
species with ; but my bird is as fat as a pig and no longer young,
and seemed quite panic-stricken. On one occasion the Regent
was left out, and Bob went straight for him ; but I always keep
the net handy now. It would take a clever bird to strike a
Regent; the latter was like a Magpie dodging a Peregrine; but
he uttered a shriek of terror which I had never heard before and
hope never to hear again ; and it was a day or two before he
fully got over the scare. Since that occasion, the aviary, with
one curious exception, is most carefully cleared of every bird
before Bob is liberated.
It is curious how often birds form the most erroneous
opinion of the nature and power of other birds. When first let
out this summer, I tossed a mealworm down for Bob, which fell
near to an aged Black-breasted Peewit, an Australian three-toed
Wattled Lapwing {Sarciopliorus pectoralis). The latter, a bottom-
less-pit so far as mealworms are concerned, and too stupid to
recognise his danger, disregarding Bob, ran for the mealworm
and obtained it. The Peewit's apparent pluck on this occasion
seems so to have impressed Bob that he always gets out of the
Peewit's way, and treats him with awe and respect. Yet if a fly
should wink, or a moth flutter, this creature will dash recklessly
off, anywhere, and often get hung and hopelessly entangled in
the trees and bushes. For over eleven years has he been in my
garden, and times without number during those eleven years

have I had to release him from tight places and set him on his
feet again, and yet to this day, when touched by the human hand,
he will startle the neighbours far and wide with his fearful cries.
The instant his feet touch the ground, the cries cease, he shakes
out his feathers, elevates his head, and gives a defiant crow,
saying as plainly as plain can be, " Escaped again, old chap ; it
would take a lot of such bipeds as you to get over me." If it had
been the privilege of the poet Gray to have lived within ear-
shot of my aviary, he would not have wasted ink and paper over
" Berkley's roof," but would rather have said :--
"The shrieks of death, thro' Cromwell Grove that ring,
Shrieks of an agoniz'd Lap-wing!"
and it is to this big coward and swaggering braggart that Bob
bows down and does obeisance.
In the Museum Catalogue (Key to the Species, Vol. VII.
p. 6), the eleven described species in the genus Myiopho)ieus are
divided into two groups, those which have white tips to the
median wing-coverts and those which have not. Bob has the
white tips, and therefore should come into the first group. Of
the three species included in this group, only one has a black
bill, and that is the Blue Whistling-bird from China, Myiophoneus
cceruleiis, of which I will speak later. The two new species are
unlike; but there is one in the other group which has several
points of resemblance, M. dicrorhynchus, a bird too coming from
Sumatra, which might easily be picked up by a Queensland
steamer. This species is thus described in the Catalogue :--
Adult. General colour above dull purplish black, with a large
tuft of white feathers at the side of the lower back and rump ;
no slioulder-patch, and no white tips to the median coverts, the
wings and tail being also like the back, the latter only a little
more blue; lores, sides of face, and ear-coverts black, with a
shade of purplish blue across the upper forehead ; entire under
surface of body dusky black, with concealed white bases to all
the breast feathers. Total length 13 inches, culmen 1.5, wing
6.4, tail 4.4, tarsus 2.1. At page 7 it is stated, " glistening ends
of feathers obsolete; bill blackish, horn-coloured at the tip and
on the lower mandible." The points of similarity between this
bird and mine are noticeable, but the points of difference are too
marked to be easily explained away. Each bird has a tuft on its
side, but that of M. dicrorhynchus seems to be made up of
white instead of party-coloured feathers. The general colour
above is not dull purplish black ; my bird now has both the
shoulder-patch and white tips to the median coverts ; the under

surface of body is hardly dusky black, and the breast feathers
have not white bases ; the glistening ends of feathers are not
obsolete ; the bill is wholly black ; and the tail is fully 5 inches
long. I took the total length on May 3 as 11J inches or perhaps
more, but as a skin it is possible that he might be stretched to
13 inches.
There remains but one other bird to be considered, viz.,
the Blue Whistling-bird (M. cceruleics) from China. The recent
appearance (June) of the patch of blue on the lesser coverts of
my bird not only brings it closer to M. cceruleus but practically
demonstrates that, when it was handled on May 3, its plumage
was far from being fully developed. Moreover, some of the
points I noted 011 the first three examinations, and from the
feathers cast in the moult, may have been marks of the im-
mature but not of the adult bird, and may now be non-existent.
For instance, I cannot say that Bob now has a single brown
feather. The country of origin, moreover, cannot be proved to
be New Guinea ; and therefore we must not allow that point,
all-important if it could be substantiated, to unduly prejudice
our judgment. Speaking broadly, the two birds are nearly
identical; and several of the minor points of difference may be
simply differences of opinion as to a shade of colour ; moreover
I am in doubt as to what limits should be imposed on the state-
ment of the Catalogue " lower back and rump ashy black with
concealed longitudinal centres of white." But it seems to me
that it would be straining the language a good deal to suppose
that the statement includes, not only the feathers which can be
correctly described as having concealed white centres, but also
those which are white on the whole or the greater part of one
web. And no mention is made of feathers 011 the breast having
concealed white centres.
This spring there has arrived at the Zoological Gardens a
nice specimen of the Blue Whistling-bird (M. cceruleus). I have
been able to obtain but momentary peeps at the bird, and cannot
speak definitely even of its outward appearance, and not at all of
the concealed markings. It seems to have the breast, etc.,
mottled in the same manner as my bird, to have the same white
spots on the wing, the same saddle-back appearance when
startled, the same boat-shaped tail, and in general shape, action,
and movement, to be just the same; on the other hand, it
seemed to be smaller, less stoutly built, and to be very much
more blue. These were my impressions ; but it is exceedingly
difficult and dangerous to compare in one's mind the particulars
of one bird with those of another in a different place and under

different circumstances. According to the Catalogue, this is a
very well known species, pretty generally distributed over China,
and " common and resident in the central and southern portions
of the country." The total length is given as 12 inches, but the
tail as only 4.6 ; and the claws are stated to be brown, whereas
those of my bird are still (July 9), as they always have been,
deep black.
I had intended obtaining the aid of an aviculturist and
having a full examination made of the new plumage of my bird,
and to have closed this paper with a report of the result, but on
July 8 I was startled by his casting one of his brand-new pri-
maries, and by the " teased " look of the wing-coverts ; another
was cast on the following day, and two more and some secon-
daries on July 10. The intense heat, the want of exercise, and
the unnatural food seem to have produced a heated condition of
the blood and this seemingly false moult ; so I determined to
examine him forthwith, and did so on July 9. It will be seen that
the resultof this examination differs in some important points from
that of May 3, but I simply give the particulars as I found them.
I may add, however, that 011 May 3 I had an expert in colours
(not an aviculturist) to assist me, who fully agreed with the
statement of colours already given, and who, by the way, was a
witness to the produced ends of the tail shafts. On this occasion
I had splendid light, and Bob was reasonably quiet.
Under side of tail black ; under tail-coverts purplish blue ;
thighs black ; abdomen deep black, with neither blue tips nor
white centres ; all the rest of the under surface black, profusely
mottled with bright blue ends to all the feathers. These, com-
mencing on the chest with white shafts, and steadily increasing
in size as the abdomen is approached, have concealed longi-
tudinal centres of white. Ear-coverts and sides of face and neck
black or purplish black, each feather boldly tipped with silvery
blue. When holding himself erect, a side view of the neck has
the appearance of a richly spangled mane, the glistening tips
running down the neck in fairly well-defined channels. Lores
black with no bright tips, the black extending back in a distinct
unspotted line above the eye but scarcely behind it. Head,
neck, and mantle apparently black, but no black base to forehead
visible ; on the forehead, and completely occupying the forehead,
there are two " comets " of light silvery-blue tips, with their
tails streaming back along each side of the crown. Hind centre
of crown, nape, and front centre of mantle black, with only a

few stray silvery tips ; rest of mantle with silvery tips ; lessei
coverts and tips to median coverts as before. Remiges much
more blue than before the moult, becoming more blue as the
body is approached, the four cast primaries having the outer
webs purplish blue, the inner black with a faint wash of purple
towards the ends, but tipped with dusky black. The ends of
the shafts of the tail feathers, although somewhat knocked about,
were still clearly visible, and just about one-sixteenth of an inch
long. No brown feathers nor feathers with brown bases could
be detected, so probably they are a mark ot immaturity.
Owing to the struggles of the bird, I could not definitely
locate the semi-white feathers of the flanks and lower back ;
they are rather long, and got mixed and twisted up together in a
regular tangle. But I am of opinion that I detected one decided
change ; the dark portions of these feathers, or many of them,
seem now to be black without any shade of blue. These semi-
white partly concealed feathers, and the breast feathers with
concealed white centres, not to mention other minor differences,
seem clearly to point to this bird being of a hitherto undescribed
species, which should be known, if the country of origin could
be made sure, as the New Guinea Whistling-bird.
[August 20.--My bird has fallen into wliat seems to be a full and
natural moult. I suppose that, owing to the voyage, change of climate,
&amp;.C., the former moult was a deferred one. I notice that two large
Australian birds in my aviary, the Regent-bird and the Green Oriole, com-
menced their annual moult about the same time. Nature is trying to set
things straight ; but the two moults succeeding one another so closely
must put a great strain on the bird's constitution.--R.P.].

Sir, --Lovely as Jamaica is, and richly though it rewards you for the
trouble of coming out to see it, I don't think it a mine of wealth from an
avicultural point of view--so far, at least, as I have seen up to the present.
Quite the most prominent figure in the bird world is the Johnny Crow, and
having heard so much about his want of personal attractions I am agree-
ably surprised, for he is quite decently good looking. He is about half as
big again as a raven, with a finer spread of wing, and flies very gracefully,
floating and balancing from side to side. Some people might object to his
raw meat head and neck, but the expression of his face is not disagreeable.
There is a price of #5 put upon his head, that is to say, it is valued at that
sum, in which you are mulcted if you destroy him; his services as a
scavenger being highly valued, and his occasional lapses from virtue, when

in forgetfulness he picks up a chicken or so, are excused. He is very tame,
hangs about the houses closely, and wherever there is a pole, an article
which is a good deal dotted about, you are sure to see a crow on the top of
it. After one of the warm torrential showers, which come now and again,
it is quite grand to see a row of poles topped by crows with their wings
fully spread to dry.
In the garden of our hotel at Kingston, I saw a couple of Mocking-
Birds, grey brown in colour, with white feathers in their long jerking tails.
They are called Nightingales, and their song is a mixture of Thrush and
Blackbird, but louder and more melodious than either. The birds seemed
very tame, and picked about in the grass. More numerous are exaggerated
Blackbirds, with a longer tail than our English friend and bigger, but minus
the bright orange bill. One of these had a nest, about which he or she
was quarrelling with another, but there was nothing in it. As I have no
books with me except Russ's Speaking Parrots, I am not able to identify
the birds, which is annoying. We saw no small birds in Kingston, but on
the way to Mandeville, two and a half hours by train, through beautiful
tropical vegetation, we saw a good many, all of sober colours and so quick
in their movements that it was impossible to describe them. I am told the
most interesting of all is the Solitaire Thrush, but have no hope of pene-
trating to the fastnesses in the woods and mountains, where alone he is to
be found. What, I suppose, everyone desires most to see is the Humming
Bird. On first view the common kind, which is very numerous in some
places and occasional in all, is disappointing, giving one the impression of
a very dark blue object, and which flies in a curious upright position, as it
were, standing on its tail in the air. But as I was watching one darting
from flower to flower of a group of caunas, not in the manner of the
Humming Bird Hawk Moth, as we are usually told, but hovering, and, as it
were, hanging upright at the lip of the blossom, it suddenly flew to my
parasol and tried the tips of several of the spokes. I thus had a very close
view, when the beautiful iridescence on the little thing's breast, back, and
tail was visible, shining in red and purple lustre. It was a stout little bird,
about as big as a Wren, and not the vision of fragility I expected. But
there are, of course, smaller ones which I have not yet seen. There is no
bird shop in Kingston, nor, so far as I have been able to ascertain, anywhere
else in the island; and although I took several electric car journey's all
round the town, besides buggy drives, for the express purpose of searching
out parrots and other birds in private possession, I only saw one, a nice
Cuban Amazon, hanging in one of the terrible cages made of flat wide
3 netal bars we have most of us seen acting prison to newly-imported birds,
outside a queer little booth-shop, devoted, if I may remember aright, to the
sale of charcoal, castor oil and mangoes.
At Mandeville, however, we found three parrots, two of the little
native Amazons which are found in the mountains, and are, I imagine,

Salle's Amazon (e), and one Yellow front. The latter is not an interesting bird,
but one of the little things talks very nicely. They are kept in the same
dreadful cages, very small, desperately dirty, and without a vestige of sand.

Probably the little Active Amazon (C. agilis) is intended, or possibly the Red-throated

and fed on watery sop, with a few peppers now and then ; but when let out
they show no disposition to get away, but go back quite contentedly to their
dreadful prisons. I asked the price of this talking bird, which was hanging
in a general store, and was told 40/-, which is, of course, rather absurd.
The proprietor may come down from this lofty altitude, if so "Serita," as
the negroes called the bird, may go home with me. The ship's captain on the
voyage out told me there was a nine-months' quarantine imposed on all
parrots landing in England, as they were supposed to bring the plague in
their feathers, but whether this is true or not I have yet to find out. It
seems odd, however, that the dealers should advertise them so freely and at
such low prices if quarantine of any kind has been performed. The season
to buy these birds here is in September, when the young parrots of the
summer are brought down by negroes from the Blue Mountains where they
have been bred, and are sold at very low prices, two or three shillings each
at most. Just now, however, I was warned that I should be asked ten
dollars or so for acclimatised birds, which has proved to be the case.
When driving along the lovely roads hereabouts we see a good many
birds which give us no chance of distinguishing them, but none that are
gay of plumage. The "Black Sparrow " is about as big as a butcher bird,
with a red throat in front, and seems to be a jolly little chap, and more
friendly than the rest. It is very difficult to understand what the black
people say until you are used to them, and I am therefore unable to give
you the local names for one or two other sober little birds we met. The
Banana-bird is, I am told, a beautiful yellow creature, and not at all un-
common, but we have not succeeded in interviewing him. A solitary
Ground Dove, seen by the roadside in a guinea-grass planting, elicited the
remark from the driver that the cruel mongoose (pronounced mongoose)
had cleared this family out even more completely than the rest of the
birds, which as a whole are only now beginning to recover from the tyranny
of "Pikki Tikki.'' I have left instructions at our Kingston Hotel for the
man who goes down to the boats to sell birds to the sailors to be, if
possible, invited to call on me when we return there before starting home;
and if I succeed in interviewing him the readers of the "Avicultural
Magazine" shall hear of any interesting purchases I may be able to make.
But the cult of birds seems an unknown tiling in the town, for outside the
solitary parrot I have mentioned, and one very poor Canary of the com-
monest description in the hotel, I saw not a single cage.
I am sorry this is not an interesting description, but the birds are
really most disappointing. I take it that until we come over to settle here,
and are able to observe them at complete leisure, it will not be possible to
make a readable article out of them. N. L. Williams.

She is not egg bound, but is suffering from some form of digestive

Her feathers are all standing like a bird which has just had a
thorough soaking in water, though they are quite dry. She now and

then gapes like a fowl with that complaint. She will eat any amount
of butter which I give her. I can't find anything obstructing her throat,
and the bowels are working freely.
As this is not the first case I have had of this kind, and which I
expect will terminate fatally, as did the previous cases, I should be glad of
any information you could supply towards a cure or prevention in future.
I should add that since being " in hospital&amp;quot; the bird has laid an egg,
but is not one whit the better for it. W. G. Douglas.
The Jollowmg reply was sent to Mr. Douglas :
If you feed a finch upon butter, you can hardly be surprised that she
should suffer from a sort of digestive disorder. Butter is not a natural food
for any bird. If you have given butter with a view to oiling the works,
because seed did not remain in the crop, I can only suppose that yon have
been using shell-sand, and the chips of shell have cut through the crop,
so that it cannot retain the seed : this is a cause of death in many finches.
Sea-sand is the proper sand to use for all birds. I use no other kind.

PARROT FINCHES BREEDING.

Sir, --In looking over some notes &amp;gt;e Parrot Finches I do not recollect
that any of our members have recorded two peculiarities when giving an
account of their birds breeding.
Whether mine were an exceptional pair I cannot say. They
were put up three times for breeding. The first time a broken
egg was found at the bottom of the cage containing two young. In
this and the following evening a most peculiar noise came from the nest
resembling the whir-r-r or rolling notes made by the Nightjar. At first I
could not locate where the sound came from, and went to the door think-
ing it came from the Colonel's ground opposite, yet I thought it strange for
them to be there, never having heard them nearer than Snelsmore Common,
about a mile and a half away. At last I found the sound came from the
birds in the nest. It seemed a song of triumph that there was an increase
to the population. At intervals of a few days two more eggs with living
chicks were tlirowm out, then an extra large egg with two young. The
last performance was the infanticide of a bird (which was forwarded to our
late Secretary to see what a fine fellow he was.) The little fellow used to
cr)&apos; out lustily of an evening for the parents to feed it, but why it was ex-
pelled from the nest after being cared for nearly three weeks (for it was
well nourished) I cannot understand.
The second and third time proved no more successful, and I lost
heart. I believe the fault was with the lady, for she was wild, but the cock
when talked to would flutter his wings, showing the under part close tp
the body of a biscuit colour. My failure at cage breeding was borne out by
our member, Mr. Savage, who twice failed when he had them in a cage,
but was successful in the aviary ( f ). W. T. CaTLEUGH.

Sir, -- Ill the Avicultural Magazine for July last, I recorded the fact of
a pair of Cape Sparrows (Passer arcnatus) having nested, though unsuccess-
fully, in my aviary. I now have the pleasure of placing on record the
successful rearing of a young bird by this pair. It left the nest on the 3rd
of August and can now (20th August) feed itself well, and the parents are
building another nest. This young bird very nearly resembles a young
House .Sparrow, but the crescent on the side of the head (whence its specific
name) is distinctly visible, as is also the chestnut brown on the scapulars
and rump. I11 fact it resembles closely the adult female with the exception
of some white markings on the flights and tail-feathers which I attribute
to partial albinism.
Am I correct in stating this to be the first instance of Passer arcnatus
having bred in England ? D. Seth-Smith.

CONURES KITTING THEIR YOUNG.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990074566666667" page_id="10098776"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Would y&apos;ou tell me if I cau bring young Nanday Parrakeets up
by hand ? I very much fear the old birds will kill them all as soon as they
leave the nesting-log. They nested some weeks ago, and had five fine fully-
fledged young birds. I expected daily to see them fly, and, wondering at
their non-appearance, looked into the nesting-log, and found that one
young Parrakeet, fully-fledged and quite fat, had been killed by a piercing
blow at the back of the skull completely smashing the head. The remain-
ing four birds are well, and, I should say, may fly any day.
I do not know if this is a peculiarity of Conures. My Orange-fronted
Conures killed their two eldest offspring in exadtly the same way, only
waited for them to leave the nest-box. In this latter case I placed the
third, a fine fully feathered young bird, in a box cage : I believe the parents
fed it, as it did not die, and is now in the aviary with an injured wing, how
caused I do not know.
I cannot understand why the parents should suddenly become so
savage. I11 the case of the Yellow-fronted Conures, I did not know a nest
existed until I discovered the two dead bodies of the young birds. The
Nandays have been looked at from time to time, but the parents apparently
did not object.
I should be much obliged if you could tell me if I cau prevent the
remaining birds sharing the same terrible fate. Would you also tell me if
either of these Conures has bred in captivity ; I can find no mention of
such an event in any of the books or magazines.
I find them perfectly&apos; trustworthy in a mixed collection, and they
never touched the young Redrumps when they flew; they never quarrel,
and are most affectionate with each other. M. Johnstone.
The following is the substance of the reply that was sent to Mrs. fohnstone.
All the Conures I have kept have been warm tempered birds who
would object to their young being inspected; some of them are intensely
jealous. It was not a wise proceeding.

<bodyText confidence="0.999442352941177" page_id="10098777"  page_num="216" year="" vol="">
But it is rather common for warm tempered birds in captivity (too
much food and too little exercise) to want to go to nest again too soon, and
to want to get rid of their young prematurely. The male is usually the
aggressor.
I should watch closely and, if necessary, remove the male only. If
the female should find four young birds too much for her, remove two and
leave her two. Watch and see she does not lay unfertile eggs and sit on
them.
If compelled to remove any of the young from the mother, you
might try your former experiment and place them in a box cage in their
father's aviary, but placing food in their own cage.
It would be very difficult to hand-rear the young if they would not
feed themselves. The way would be to chew up the food in your mouth,
and place the bill of the young bird between your lips, and let it feed from
the food inside.
But probably they are too old to be tame enough to feed from y&apos;our
mouth, and probably they are old enough to feed themselves if you place
in their cage some of the following foodsBanana, boiled maize, boiled
rice, plain biscuit, spongecake, date (cut in small pieces), cut up raisins, fig,
pear, grapes, and any green food with which the parents were supplied ;
and crushed canary seed might be sprinkled over some of the softer food.
L,et there be a dish of crushed canary mixed with crumbled plain biscuit,
and on the top lay some pieces of date, raisin, fig, etc. Also supply spray
millet.
At page 171 of Notes on Cape Birds, you will find an account of the
breeding of Naiulays in confinement, and of the probable rearing of two
young birds. See also page 531 of The Bazaar, of the 5th October, 1892.
I am not sure to what species you refer under the names of Orange-
and Yellow-fronted Conure. Assuming that you mean either Petz's
(Conurus canicularis) or the Golden-crowned (Half-moon) Conure (C. aureus), I
must admit that I cannot find any notice of the rearing of either species in
this country. But they have so often been imported, and in the past some-
times in large numbers, especially the Half-moon, that it is more than
likely that they have been bred. Reginald Phieeipps.

BREEDING OF THE ROLLER IN CAPTIVITY.

By W. H. St. Quintin.
Everybody must admire the brilliant, but harmonious,
colours of a Roller; but it is not every aviculturist who cares to
give the space, and attention necessary to keep these fine birds
in health and good condition. As I can not learn that Rollers
have been bred in captivity, or at any rate in this country, I
venture to send a short account of my birds, and their breeding
operations during this last summer.
A fine young bird, which turned out to be a male, came
into my possession in the autumn of 1897 ; and from one of our
members I obtained a pair, of which the male soon died, the
following spring. The two surviving birds were put into a
compartment of my heated aviary, with a sufficiently spacious
"fly"; their companions being some Indigo-birds, Nonpareils,
a pair of Painted Quails, and a male and two females of the
Sandgrouse, (P. quadticinctus ). The latter have never been
interfered with, but I soon found it necessary to remove the
smaller birds, as, especially in the spring, the male Roller was
not to be trusted. The female was from the first timid ; and
until this spring she never allowed the male to approach her;
though he seemed willing enough to make friends. As I have
before described in the Magazine, he was exceedingly tame with
me ; and often tried to induce me to accept a blackbeetle or a
mealworm, after taking a perch on my head or shoulder. After
vainly paying the female similar attentions, I have seen him,
apparently losing all patience, drive at her, and knock her off
her perch, which of course did not conduce to a more friendly
feeling on her part. I could do nothing but hope that in time
she might lose her timidity; and in the meanwhile I endeavoured
to get her into as good condition as possible by careful feeding.

and especially by increasing their insecft food as the natural
nesting season in each year approached.
It was not till last May had well advanced that I noticed
that the female was becoming bolder, and more friendly towards
her mate : while both of them, to my delight, put on an unusual
bloom upon their plumage, the female curiously showing more
blue in the tints of her neck, throat and breast ; while the other
bird was much more green in those parts. A stranger would,
from outward appearances, undoubtedly have mistaken the
sexes of this pair ; if he did not happen to hear the ringing
harsh croak, so much more powerful and prolonged in the male
bird ; and which he always accompanied by throwing his head
up in the well known attitude of the Great Australian Laughing
Jackass.
Presently the female was seen to fly in and out of the
large hollow log, and there were other unmistakable signs
which indicated that at last my hopes were in a fair way to be
realized.
As we had to be very careful not to disturb the birds, it is
impossible to assign exadt dates ; but we thought that laying
commenced on the 13th June ; while young birds were first heard
calling for food 011 the 2nd of July.
The birds were kept well supplied with mealworms, gentles,
and such beetles as could be collected, as well as their ordinary
mixture of rabbit chopped up with the fur, and small bones,
mice and hard boiled egg. Fortunately, while feeding the young
on insedts, the parents continued to eat the chopped meat, &amp;c.
themselves,which of course made matters easier. I have found in
the case of other insectivorous birds, such as Rock Thrushes,
that, as long as there were insects going, their ordinary food was
neglected; and it is hard to keep both parents and brood on
insect diet, as at midsummer mealworms are difficult to obtain
in quantity. As the young advanced the rabbit and egg were
taken up to the nest; and presently we were able to add wasp
grubs to the menu.
On July the 22nd, the young were still heard calling lustily
in the log-nest, and the parents were frequently carrying up food,
and all seemed going on most satisfactorily. I11 the evening my
man told me that the female had been fighting badly with the
male ; and I found him crouching in a corner of the aviary
watching her ; while his mate was jealously keeping him away
from the nest. After I had separated them, he, poor fellow,

seemed so anxious to perform his duties to the young, fluttering
up with food in his beak against the glass partition, almost
refusing food himself, that I with some diffidence put them
together again. This was a bad move, for the virago attacked
her husband with such violence that he sustained serious injuries
on the head, chiefly I think in his efforts to avoid her dashes,
and though I got him out as soon as I could, he pined away and
died the third day, to my great regret. Fortunately this quarrel
did not divert the female from her duties, and she continued
diligently to feed the young. On the 28th July, (26 days after
the young were first heard) one of the young Rollers left the
nest. It could perch and fly well from the first; and two days
later another appeared. For about a week the young returned
to the log to sleep ; and it was some time before I liked to
examine the nest hole. When I did there were no more eggs
left unhatched, as I expected would have been the case; but
there was so much rubbish in the hole, the excreta of the young
never having been removed, that other unfertile eggs may have
been crushed up, and not seen.
Inside the cavity there was a slight covering of rotten
wood ; but though the parents had been occasionally seen with
material in their beaks, nothing that could be called a nest was
found when the log was taken down to be cleaned out.
The young were surprisingly active, when they left the
nest, and soon began to feed themselves. They are much paler
in all their tints than the parents, and at this age might easily be
distinguished, even on the wing, from the adults. Anybody
who feels interested in these birds may see them in the Western
Aviary at the Zoological Gardens, where they have just been
deposited ; as in view of a possible brood next year, I thought it
well to send them off, and to replace them by an adult male,
which has been for some time well taken care of for me at the
Gardens in Regent's Park.

(Bathilda ntficauda).
By Alfred E. Nicholson.
My experience of this delightful species is very limited,
and only dates back to last Autumn, when I succeeded, after
years of waiting, in procuring a pair from one of our members.
They were in perfect plumage, but to the experienced eye it was
evident the cock was not robust. They were exhibited at our

New Year Show, which extends over two days and necessitated
their being in the hall over-night. This circumstance cost the
cock his life, but I was fortunate in being able to replace him
with another that spent his days, when not eating, singing to his
new-found wife.
They were located in a small indoor aviary, or perhaps it
would be more correct to call it a large cage, with such other
inmates as Cordon-bleus, Gouldian, Parrot, Pectoral, Cherry,
Bicheno, and Grey Singing-finches. I fear they were rather
overcrowded, aud the Rufous-tails being a new species to me,
I kept them under somewhat close surveillance for some time,
but never witnessed them display the least sign of bad temper
towards their companions.
First week of May I turned out some thirty small seed-
eaters, amongst which were the Rufous-tails. Their first clutch
of four eggs was deposited in a husk, but no attempt at incu-
bation was made. The second, of six, was laid in a small
travelling box hanging in the indoor portion of the aviary, and
in which a beauiiful domed nest was built; the material used
including live grass, willow shavings, and fine paper shavings
(such as chocolates are packed in) ; but if there is one thing
Rufous-tails are more partial to than any other as a food and
nesting material it is chicken weed. They would go all over the
weeds, eat what they wanted, then appropriate the remainder
for building purposes while it was yet green and, to my mind,
unsuitable for such a purpose. The Rufous-tails knew better,
however.
Some friends called on 20th July and, of course, were
taken round the aviary. I pointed out the box containing, as
I thought, the Rufous-tails' eggs, and said they numbered six,
but I would show them. O11 examination the eggs were found
to have vanished, and six little pieces of live flesh had taken
their place. This reminds me that they do not brood until the
clutch is completed, and the young hatch out altogether in
consequence. The parents did not seem to mind our inter-
ference in the least, and I often turned one or the other of them
off the nest to show the broods to subsequent visitors. This is
true of all my nesting birds, with the exception of Parrot Finches.
The nest soon got very dirty, so I determined 011 a remedy.
Another box, a size larger, was lined for them with clean building
material, and made as near a duplicate of the original as human
hands could make it. The young were then transferred to it, and
put in the same position as the other was taken from. The

parents went on feeding as if nothing had happened, and were,
no doubt, very grateful for a change so agreeable and conducive
to their greater comfort.
I am sorry no record was taken as to when the young left
the nest, but on my first discovering they had made their
" entry," I took down the box and found one mite afraid to
venture. This one proved to be the delicate one of the family,
and I feared the parents had so much to do attending to the
five "branchers," that it would be neglected and die. They did
not forget it, however, and three days afterwards it helped to
swell the crowd. Until lately I could readily identify this weak-
ling from the others. It suffered from diarrhoea, and although
the parents kept it alive, they did not appear so solicitous of its
welfare as they were of the more robust members of their family;
but then it moped, and did not importune them so incessantly as
they. I have frequently witnessed it, while sitting with its head
buried among its feathers, being gently pecked by a parent:
round would come the little head, and as speedily disappear. Off
the parent would pop, as if to say, " If you do not wish anything
I know five little birds that do."
The sound emitted by the young, when beseeching to be
fed, is shrill and clear, and can be heard quite a distance away;
distinct from the husky sound of young Gouldians, for example.
The third clutch, numbering three, was discovered and
removed from among the young at the time they were transferred
into the clean nest box.
Towards the end of August the nights became cold, and I
noticed there was something amiss with the hen. Egg-binding
was suspected, and found to be the trouble. After treatment a
shell-less egg was laid. I took the hint, and placed her in a cage
indoors, for good, as I intended at the time; but the weather
took a warm turn, and although I hope she will not go to nest
again this year, I could not resist the wish to see them again a
united family, so let her fly.
My pair has had ample opportunity, during the season, to
indulge in the evil to which the species is said to be addicted,
namely, egg-eating. Eggs broken by accident have been allowed
to remain for days on exposed places in the aviary, without
being disturbed.
When the young leave the nest they resemble in general
appearance the Silverbill, with the exception of that part of the
plumage from which they take their name. The top side of the

<bodyText confidence="0.992406772727273" page_id="10098783"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
tail is always red, and at once proclaims their identity, although
in no other respect do they resemble their parents. While
Parrot and Gouldian Finches leave the nest with beads on each
side of the gape, the Rufous-tails do not; but they have their
peculiarity, which consists of a portion of the lower mandible at
the base being white, similar to the Scarlet Tanager, but less
even in proportion. My wife says she observed this white
portion split when the young gaped to be fed, and unless she is
mistaken, both mandibles must be coloured, in which case the
upper to a much less extent than the lower. This white portion
gradually faded, and on 7th September had entirely disappeared.
White spots had made their appearance on 26th August, a few
red on 29th August, and one young cock at least was noticed
to be singing on 31st August.
As I did not feel equal to describing their plumage accurate-
ly, outside aid was sought, and I must consider myself extremely
lucky to have such a member as Mr. Jas. F. Dewar so near.
On nth September the family of eight were put into a small
show-cage the better for observation, and conveyed thither.
Mr. Dewar's description of the young is as follows :--Back and
wings drab, breast fawn, lighter over abdomen to covert feathers
of tail, under side of tail dark brown, top side rusty red, upper
mandible dark brown, under mandible lighter towards the base
and beginning to show pink, legs and feet dark flesh ; five show-
ing white spots, two red spots quite distinctly, three slightly ;
eye dark centre with brown ring giving it the appearance of
being larger than that of the parents'. Mr. Dewar also hazards
the opinion that the brood is made up of four hens and two
cocks.
They apparently reach maturity at an early age, as on the
9th September, we observed from a window overlooking the
outdoor part of the aviary, a very amusing sight. A young cock
with a piece of fibre quite eight inches long in his bill, was seen
to sidle up to another of the brood--presumably a hen--turn his
head and tail to one side, perform a ridiculous love - dance,
singing the while exactly as does the Cordon-bleu under the
same circumstances, and enough to make his father green with
envy. Nor does their precocity end here. They are always the
first to investigate the soft-food vessel, and when the bath is
introduced the other inmates of their abode have to give place
and play the part of spectator until the ablutions of the all-
important Rufous-tails are completed. Young Gouldians are
certainly very wise, but since the Rufous-tails have come on the
scene the}&amp;quot; (the Gouldians) must take a seat far back.

Iii the matter of food there was nothing special supplied.
Seeds (white and French millet), a simple soft-food mixture, no
mealworms ; groundsel, shepherd's purse, and other green food
intermittingly; but, as already stated, chicken-weed is the
Rufous-tails' little weakness.
THE MALABAR GREEN FRUITSUCKER.
(Chloropsis malabaricusJ .
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
This is a very rare bird and but seldom imported, and
then only by two's and three's. They are consequently very
expensive, and only within the reach of the rich or reckless. I
am, unfortunately, only one of the latter.
Some months since a friend of mine in the Indian trade
wrote and told me that he was bringing home a pair of Green
Fruitsuckers, would I like them ? Careful readers of the " Avi-
cultural Magazine" will not need to be told how I answered that
letter. The birds on arrival were in very fair condition for soft
bills after a long voyage ; and I was highly delighted with my
new venture. They were marvellously tame and would sit quite
unconcernedly on my finger and let me stroke them without any
symptom of fear. I at once put them into a big roomy cage
and proceeded to attend to their wants. Their feathers were a
bit sticky and messed up by the mixture they had been fed on ;
so I let them have a good tub, and they were soon busy preening
their feathers. The food bill was a bit of a difficulty, as such
expensive birds can't be played with. At first I gave them my
own soft mixture and banana; they did very well on this ; but
the expense was prohibitive as we can only get bananas once a
week at Reeds; so I set about finding some cheaper substitute.
I finally settled on plain boiled rice, steamed perfectly dry ; so
that every grain is separate. They would not eat a "stodgy"
mess. Beside the rice, I gave them a pot of stewed apple nicely
sweetened with sugar, and they are a pair of perfect beauties ;
every feather in place and as tight as wax. For those who have
never seen the Green Bulbul, I append a description that will
fairly make them break the iotli Commandment, though at the
same time I am bound to admit, as Shakspeare said of someone
else, "As for her state it beggared all description."
The cock is a glorious fellow, a beautiful grass green in
colour, the face round the eye, chin and throat a velvety black ;

a shining hyacinthine blue stripe on the cheek ; the forehead
bright gold, shading into the green of the crown ; the wings green
with just a suspicion of turquoise blue on the shoulder butts;
the flights brown ; tail, greenish black, tipped with greenish
grey ; bill, black and long and curved slightly ; feet, lead colour ;
iris, brown.
The hen is considerably smaller, and of a different shade
of green impossible to describe, but easy to see in the actual
specimen ; but she has certainly not got a green forehead, as
asserted by Dr. Butler, but a yellow one, a little duller perhaps
and slightly narrower than her mate's. It is perfectly easy to
tell if you have a pair by their actions ; as two cocks would act
precisely like the celebrated cats of Kilkenny--they would kill
each other. The hen is so very seldom imported that it is quite
likely that Dr. Butler has never seen one (a).
Another certain sign of sex is the beautiful and varied
song of the cock ; those who have not had the pleasure of hear-
ing him, have no idea of the extent of his power. The hen only
utters a harsh scolding note.
The Green Bulbuls are bright active birds and very amus-
ing to watch. Mine are now in a good-sized indoor aviary where
they will remain all the winter ; and in the spring, if all goes
well, they will be turned out to take their luck, and maybe to
reproduce their kind.
I daily give the Fruitsuckers some mealworms, and they
are very keen after them. They have long prehensile tongues,
very much like the Australian Honeyeaters, and they use them
in the same way.
They are gentle inoffensive birds, and I don't think they
could hurt a good able bodied bluebottle, unless they ate him.
Let me end with a little story. Some years ago a dealer
had about three of these Green Bulbuls in stock, very fine and
healthy; a rival dealer had none ; but not to be bested, as we say
up here, what do you think he did ? He inserted an advertise-
ment in all the papers : " Green Bulbuls--fine--30/- each ; don&apos;t
{a). Mr. Farrar is correctin stating that the forehead is not green ; but I should not
call it yellow, but rather dull orange. When I wrote my description I had no hen before
me, so referred to Jerdon's Birds of India : I have however seen the hen. In the Calcutta
market this bird is by no means rare ; and can be purchased there, I believe, for about one
rupee. Some years ago our friend Mr. Housden brought me several of these birds (I forget
whether three or five! at a reasonable price; but I was not flush of money at the time, and
(not being ' reckless ') restrained the longing which assailed me to possess one. Chlovopsis
malabaricus is not accounted a specially rare bird, even in the British Bird-market.--A.G.B.
Five were offered me the other day at 30/- each.--R.P.

pay any more." Need I say that when the other unfortunate
dealer asked considerably more for his genuine birds, he was
regarded by the unenlightened public in the light of a barefaced
swindler, and the other as a benefactor who had put the public
on their guard !

I.
My Gouldian Finches--the blackheads--are a merry little
pair, in the pink and polished wax of condition, and well
supplied with pounded egg-shell, cuttle bone, sand, little stones,
and all the etceteras in the way of grass seed and so on that the
heart of a Grass-finch ought to be able to desire. Nevertheless,
Mrs. Gould managed to become egg-bound the other day, to my
horror, for I remembered how fatal this hateful occurrence is said
to be to these birds. In the morning she was jerking her tail
and scuttering in the sand on the floor: I steamed her and
applied a drop of olive oil with a camel's hair pencil: in the
afternoon she was rather worse, and I repeated the process more
elaborately. When returned to the cage she went to her nest
and I had great hopes. But at io p.m., she was much worse, and
the parts were beginning to look discoloured. I thought--this is
kill or cure. I had (of course) none of my bird books at hand ;
they were all out visiting; and the only help obtainable was
from Russ's Parrot book, wherein he says " Break the egg and
press it out." Now I felt sure someone else--several of them--
said this would kill the bird, but I considered thatit was kill or cure,
and also that in treating mammals it is a good practice to remove
the obstructing body piecemeal provided no injury or abrasion is
inflicted on the mucous membrane of the passage. I covered
the head of a common black pin (there was no virtue in its being
black that I know of, but it came first to hand) with boracic
ointment, introduced it with extreme gentleness and care, and felt
the egg about # or f of an inch up. Having lubricated the passage
by this means, I removed and turned the pin, and in fear and
trembling reinserted it point forwards and punctured the shell.
I did not attempt the " press it out." Three minutes afterwards
the egg was laid, and zvhat a supper that bird ate! She was
perfectly fey with delight at getting rid of her pain, poor mite.
Did I do right, or was it only by great good luck that my
bungling effort succeeded ? I have had a good deal of experience
in the parallel troubles of little dogs, but an atom of Mrs. Gould's

size is a different thing altogether, and in previous cases I have
never ventured to operate thus.
II.
Have you heard the Long-tailed Grass-finch call for his
early tea in the morning ? It was quite ludicrous when I had one
of these little birds in my bedroom for a few days to hear him
begin about the time when the servants were stirring--" Tea-ee-
ee! Tea-ee-ee ! ! " long clear calls one after the other, exactly as
if he wished to share in our matutinal beverage.
III.
If Parrots were only not so mischievous they would be so
much more amusing kept loose than in cages. My young Double-
fronted Amazon, that I brought from Jamaica, is the most rest-
less, worrying baby you can imagine, always in mischief. I am
thinking of getting him a nurse, and I am sure going out in a
perambulator would give him the greatest possible delight. He
is never still for an instant except when shut up in his cage, and
if that confinement lasts too long he mopes. Anything bright
attracts his attention at once, and he has snatched and more or
less broken with his dreadful white bill all the articles of
jewellery I habitually wear. He has cracked the pearls on my
chain, and broken two bracelets, and tries his very best to spoil
my rings, always grabbing at the stones when he gets a chance.
I may do anything with him, although he now and then gives
me a shrewd nip, but my husband he hates (and all other men)
watches his opportunity, and gives them a vicious, twisting pinch.
He tumbles about like a kitten in my lap, and spends much time
teasing the unlucky maid who may be peeling apples or other-
wise getting food ready in the kitchen, where I send him to
recreate, since there is less there for him to destroy than elsewhere
in the house. He laughs and cries like a whole family of nigger
babies, reproduces all the noises he can collect, especially the
vulgar voices and expressions of any low class people such as go
by outside on a bank holiday or on Sundays, uses the usual Pretty
Polly and Hullo vocabulary freely in lots of different voices, and
shows off with great pride a quantity of the worst possible Spanish
swears he acquired from an accomplished lilac and green
individual on board ship. This latter must certainly have gone
through the Cuban war.
IV.
My hen Alexandrine is the least mischievous of the
parrots. You might suppose the quiet Eclectus, sitting so primly

inside or on the top of his cage, speaking in such a sweet ljitle
soft voice and kissing so affectionately and daintily with the
gentlest touch of his big bill, to be exempt from the failing, but
if you look you will see a whole box of matches fragmentarily
adorning the tray of his abode. He filched them from the corner
of the mantelpiece just now while I was out of the room, and
when I returned, pretended he couldn't imagine how it happened.
But .Polly Alexander will sit all day quite good upon her stand,
to which she is not chained. At tea time she orders a lump of
sugar and a piece of cake, dipping the former in her water and
licking it in a delightfully intelligent way. Her only vocal
accomplishment is then displayed, " T'chik, t'chik, t'chik (as to
a horse but louder) kiss, kiss, KISS!" About 9.30 p.m. she
flaps her wings and sails across the room, alighting without
discrimination and equally without dignity--usually in a bunch
between something and the wall. This aerial display alarms my
husband extremely, the more so as she always appears to be
steering for his head. He had the pleasure of removing her
from the travelling cage when she arrived, when, in spite of the
thickest of driving gloves, she left her mark upon him, and
has borne him the grudge of the injurer ever since.

No. II.
Sir, --Since writing before, I have learnt a little more about the
Jamaica birds, partly by observation and partly by a visit to the Museum in
Kingston, where there is a fairly complete collection, some of them vilely,
and others tolerably well stuffed. At Port Antonio, where the hotel is built
on a hill, sloping down by grassy banks, covered with cultivated trees and
splendidly coloured crotons, to the lovely harbour, there were a few birds,
which were fairly tame and which we could watch from the verandah. A
pair of Banana Quits had a nest in an acacia. It was an untidy heaped
mass of hay-like fibres, swung at the end of a branch, and while we were
there they apparently brought off the young ones, though we did not see
the latter. The Banana Quit is a little bird, about the size of a Blue Tit,
greenish olive in colour, with smart yellow cheeks, and altogether a
showy little thing; just the same size is the quiet looking Grass Quit
of which there are two species, the yellow-faced, Phonipara olivacea, which
in the absence of the authority for reference, I take it is Gosse's Olive Finch,
and the black-faced P. marchii (b). The Banana Bird is quite different to the
Banana Quit, and is a handsome thing, with a good deal of black and
yellow about it, and nearly as large as a (c) Thrush (Icterus leucopteryxj.

The Green Tody (Todus viridis) the Robin of Jamaica, is not in the
least like a Robin, but is a little Finch no bigger than the Grass Quit, of a
bright grass green with a red throat, very gay and striking--quite the
brightest-coloured of the native birds other than Parrakeets.
I have made arrangements to have some of the following birds sent
to me, but doing so was a matter of great difficulty, as it was almost im-
possible to find anyone who would undertake to catch and ship them.
Whether or not they wall reach me safely remains to be seen.
Ground Doves [ChamcspeUa passerina) little grey things, very pretty--
Banana Birds ; Grass Quits ; Banana Quits ; Woodpecker Quits ; Green
Tody ; Blue Quit (Euphonia jainaica ).
I have managed to secure a couple of Parrots, one a Jamaica Amazon
(Chrysotis collatia ?) of which, so far as I can make out, there are two
indigenous species, one with a black bill and one with a white, the latter
being considered by the natives the better talker (d). The white-billed bird
has blue wings and a red tail, and is otherwise all green. The black-billed
bird has two curious black spots on its cheeks, blue flights, a little red on
the shoulders, and a tint of dark peacock blue about the forehead. Both
are small birds, hardly larger than a Blackbird, and the general plumage is
very rich dark green. My other Parrot is merely an imported Double-
fronted Amazon from one of twelve brought by a super-cargo of an
American Fruit Steamer, residing in Port Antonio. He lost nine out of the
dozen by poisoning : they got loose in his garden and ate something which
incontinently finished them off. This bird is a good talker, but I could have
bought it just as well in England. It cost ten dollars; the freightage is
nil for birds with passengers on the home-bound steamers, but it is the
proper thing to give somebody a tip on their behalf. Several Parrots on
board are looked after-- tant bien que mal --by various stewards, who generally
omit to clean them out, but feed them liberally enough, put them out on
the sunny after-deck in the daytime and take them in at night. Mine have
cosy quarters in the barber's shop, whence I fetch them every morning,
tidy them up, and take them an outing, and I shall give the barber 5/- each
for his kind accommodation, wdiich sum is about that paid by the other
proprietors to their deputies.
In Port Antonio, I picked up for five dollars, a lovely little bird, which
I will not attempt to name, as I have never kept any of the Tanagers or
Sugar Birds and fancy it belongs to one or other family. It is the size of
the long-tailed Humming Bird, of Jamaica, and has a similar beak. Its
general colour is in several shades of bright royal blue, the head capped
with exquisite turquoise, short erectile feathers, put up like those of the
Saffron Finch when it receives attention, of which it is very fond. The
wings have a bar of bright yellow, and are yellow underneath, the feet and
legs are orange and waxen, and the toenails black. This exquisite sprite
lives on banana, of which he consumes a vast amount, getting through
about one third of a large banana in one day. He will not touch any other
fruit, and never goes on the floor of the cage. He is perfectly steady, and
in show plumage. Our members would, I am sure, be amused if they
could see the cage enshrining this fragile jewel. I bought him in a crazy
erection of split cane, hailing, I fancy, from India, though he himself was
said to have come from S. America, and when we got to Kingston I went
( d). Chrysotis collatia and C. agilis. --D. S.-S.

to the best ironmonger in the town to seek for a boxcage, more calculated
for his due protection. No such a thing, I was told, could be got; but
they could make a cage in every way suitable. The price was not ruinous
--3/--but the completed article I will dispose of to any member who wishes
to confine a wild squirrel or a pair of rats, under the sure conviction that
he will find it suitable ! It resembles in shape a small dog-kennel, is made of
thick match-boarding, and has perches an inch in diameter, with a curious
door on the guillotine principle, despite all which it has served its purpose.
I longed to stay&apos; in Jamaica in order to set up an outdoor aviary of
Australian Finches and another of Parrakeets (this was my only reason for
wishing to expatriate myself, as in many respects, mosquitoes and Creole
food especially, I thought the place utterly detestable) for the climatic
conditions are absolutely perfect for such purposes.
Yet, at home, where the trouble involved is great, we are enthusiastic
in our pursuit of aviculture, while out there scarcely a soul takes the
slightest interest in birds of any kind. M. L. WmiAMS.
No. III.
Since I brought the little " Blue Bird," of which I wrote in my last,
home, I find that I was not quite accurate in my description of him ; and
I have also identified him, and should like you to tell me, if you will be so
kind, whether he is not rather a rare importation, and what is his value ?
What I supposed to be very dark blue on his back is (I nowsee in a good light)
black : the black markings are very clearly defined : the top of the head is
an exquisite turquoise, under the wings is custard colour, the legs and feet
are orange red : the shape like a Wren (but he is double the size), the tail
rather cocked : the plumage silken, exquisitely tight and smart : he is the
Sai, or Blue Csereba, of South America. Vide p. 3, vol. 3, of the " Book of
Birds " (Dr. Brelim and J. Jones) where he is figured. But this bird has a
black beak, whereas the statement there is that the beak is yellow. Since
I got him home I find he will eat plenty of things besides banana, which
has, however, been his only&apos; food, unless he ate the ants and little flies
which in Jamaica come upon any fruit left about. He eats wasp grubs
greedily, and green caterpillars, also ants' eggs, and mealworms, but is not
keen on these latter. He will not touch egg or any farinaceous sub-
stance. I see Brelim says ''seeds, fruit and insects," so I will try him with
seeds in variety. He is a most lovely creature : I wish I could get a hen
for him, as I believe these are very gregarious birds.
M. D. Wiliams.
P.S.--He never goes on the ground if he can help it, but is intensely
active, though very tame and steady&apos;.
PIGEON AIDING.
Sir,--I shall be much obliged if you will kindly advise me as to how
to treat a Triangular Spotted Pigeon, I have had the bird for some time,
and it has always seemed strong and healthy until a few weeks ago, when
it began to get lame. I do not think the feet are injured in any way&apos;, but
they have entirely lost colour--and from being dark pink are now almost
white; the same change has taken place in the bird's legs.

A short time ago the colour seemed coming back, and the bird
appeared rather better, but it is now as bad as ever again.
The Pigeon passes most of the day nesting amongst some straw on
a shelf. It seems disinclined to walk, and when it does it goes down
heavily at one side.
I think the bird must be out of health as I have noticed the excreta
are liquid (but not transparent) and of a dull yellow-green colour. The
Pigeon is in a large aviary, but it is sometimes rather damp, and does not
get much sun. Would you advise me to move the bird ? It is very nervous,,
and the slightest attempt to catch it distresses it very much.
R. Alderson.
The following reply was sent to Miss Anderson :
My idea from your description is that the Pigeon is failing from want
of sun and warmth. I should put it in the driest and most sunny aviary you
have. *
I have seen a great many of the species breeding freely in Continental
Zoos, from which I gathered that they are not generally delicate. All the
Pigeon tribe are the better for having rock salt at hand.

Sir, -- I should be very much obliged if }-ou would kindly tell m
what you think the Mannikin I send herewith died from. I have had a
pair of them nearly a month, and they are in a very large cage, with some
other small foreign birds--a Virginian Nightingale and a Java Sparrow. It
seemed perfectly well, until yesterday, when it sat with its head under its
wing a good deal. About 7.30 ,1 looked at the birds and this one was down at
the bottom of the cage, swaying its head about in an odd way. I took it
out and gave it some water and a few drops of sherry which I thought
might revive it, and put it back. It tried to fly upon the perches but fell
heavil}&apos; on its head. I took it out again and gave it a little water but again
it fell down on its head ; before it tried to fly up, seemed to turn about as it
it were having a fit. I then put it into a very small cage and it sat on the
perch all right. I looked at it at 10, and it seemed more or less all right,
but this morning I found it dead. I cannot understand the reason of its
dying like this, and should be very grateful if you would kindly tell me,
and I should know perhaps how to prevent another death of the same sort.
Foreign birds are so unsatisfactory often, for they seem to die from no
reason, however much care is lavished on them. Would you also tell me
whether there is any chance of any of my birds nesting. I have Bronze-
headed Mannikins, Zebra Finches, Avadavats, and the enclosed sort of
Black-headed Mannikins. The cage is a wire-fronted one, wood all round ;
It is 4ft. long, 3ft. high, and 2ft. broad. I have put in two of those little
grass nests. The cage stands in a cool conservatory.
I must apologise for giving you so much trouble.

forwarded to me : but the symptoms point to a disease of the brain which
is not rare among the Ornamental Finches : it is probably due to a bacillus
which enters the brain through the eye.
It is frequently the case that inflammation of one eye accompanies the
brain trouble ; then the bird aggravates the disease by rubbing its eye in
the sand, so that I have known it to become so inflamed and corroded that
I had to kill the sufferer to end its torment. A. G. BUTLER.
THE SAI, OR BLUE COEREBA.
Sir, --In reply to Mrs. N. L. Williams' enquiries, the Yellow-winged
Blue-Creeper, Coereba cyanea (usually Coereba, rarely Caereba), is not
common in this country, but can hardly be described as especially rare. It
may be seen not infrequently in the Parrot House at the Zoo; and I can
remember having seen it at not less than one Bird Show--on one solitary
occasion (at the Aquarium) I think there was a pair. On some two or three
occasions, if I mistake not, the species has been offered to me in London,
usually at #3 each, which perhaps may be regarded as about its market
value. But it is one thing to want a bird, quite another to want to sell it.
In its wild state, it feeds largely on the tiniest insects found on the
foliage of trees and shrubs. The green fly of our own gardens should suit
it admirably. Reginald Phillipps.

QUERY ABOUT VIRGINIAN NIGHTINGALES.
Sir, --Will any of your readers give their experience of how to rear
Virginian Nightingales, and the best way to treat them, as I have been un-
lucky in my first attempt.
I bought two birds; the cock in the spring, and the hen in August.
They at once paired, and she laid two eggs in a Hartz Mountain cage under
the glass in the outside aviary. On Thursday, August 30th, I found two
young ones, and so gave plenty of egg food. I had to pass the hen to feed

the birds daily, but she did not mind, and when she had young she did not
leave the nest. The cock fed too, but on Sept. 2nd I found one young one
thrown out, and pecked : it was rather thin. The other birds in the aviary
ate the mealworms so quickly, so I put some near the nest in a little tin,
and the}&apos; both fed the young ones on them ; but next morning, Sept. 5th,
at 8 a.m., as I did not see the hen on, I went and looked ; and after seeing
the nest empty, found the young one away from the nest--dead. It was fat
and healthy, and only had one peck in its side.
The birds had green peas, oatmeal, ants' eggs, hard-boiled egg;
seed (crushed hemp, sunflower seed) to eat. The hen fed the young one on
the egg food, which is mixed with Spratt's fine biscuit meal, and soaked
ants' eggs. They are in a mixed aviary.
I think, this spring, that the cock Virginian must have thrown some
young Bullfinches out of their nest, because I kept picking them up and
putting them back the first week : and then the hen sat so tight she
crushed them in both nests, and last year she reared seven. I can put the
Cardinals next year in another aviary, but I should like to know what birds
to put with them. They are very quiet. M. C. Hawke.

<bodyText confidence="0.996818333333333" page_id="10098793"  page_num="232" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I saw some curious foreign Pigeons in Mr. Green's shop last
month. He told me they were sent him by a lady, along with some other
Doves (Turtles and Indian Greenwing), but that he did not know from
what country they came, nor whether they were a domestic variety or a
wild species. I send you the following description of them, hoping that
it may enable yon to identify them. Head, large and coarse ; neck, thick;
plumage, dark slaty gray on head, back and breast, light ashy blue on the
rump, and dusky brown mottled with lightish yellow on the wings.
I should also be greatly obliged if you would kindly give me inform-
ation on the following points, re Kestrels. (1) How to distinguish the sexes
in adult and also young birds, and at what age do they assume adult
plumage? (2) When is their nesting season, how many eggs do they lay,
and how long is their period of incubation ? (3) What is the best food for
them, and how much is required by old birds and also by young when they
leave the nest and commence feeding themselves. (4) At what age do the
young leave the nest and commence feeding themselves ? (5) Am I correct
in believing that they are noil-migratory, therefore fit to winter in an out-
door aviary without artificial heat ? I may add that the one which I have
bought from Mr. Green is a last year's bird ; and that I have bought it, not
for hawking, but to keep down the rats in my aviaries, and to show and to
breed from : so I should imagine it would require less care to keep it in
good health flying loose in an aviary, than if it were leading the unnatural
life of a trained Hawk. Chas. CuShny.
The following replies -were sent to Mr. Cushny.
I regret that I am quite unable to identify the Pigeon from your
description. Further particulars, with measurements, might possibly
enable me to do so. O. E. CRESSWEEb.

In reply to your queries re Kestrels--(i) The sexes in the adults may
be distinguished by the male having a slaty blue tail with one dark bar,
and the female a reddish tail with many dark bars ; in the young the sexes
are practically alike, and the tails as in the adult female ; there is, however,
a trace of the slate colour at the base of the tail in the young males.
(2) They nest in May, and lay five or six eggs which are hatched after 19
days incubation. (3) The best food is small birds and mice, but they live
well on raw lean beef and require a piece about the size of a Sparrow per diem :
if possible they should have birds or mice once a week, and have nothing on
the following day: young and old should be fed much alike. (4) The
young leave the nest at about six weeks of age, and in a cage can feed
themselves when about a month old, but in a wild state the parents
probably catch their food for a much longer period, long after they have
left the nest and are flying. (5) The Kestrel, living in England all the year
round, will do perfectly well in an unlieated aviary, but, in my opinion, do
better both in Summer and Winter in an outdoor aviary with a covered roof
than in one in which they are exposed to the rain and weather; according
to my experience all raptorial birds are very susceptible to cold when in
captivity, and do much better in a covered-in aviary.
I am afraid the Kestrel will not keep down rats except young ones,
but is, nevertheless, a most delightful bird in captivity. The best protection
against rats in an aviary is an owl, either Barn or Tawny ; but as they move
about at night they cannot be allowed in an aviary with small birds.

Sir, --Can you tell me if there are any birds in South and South-East
Russia which would make interesting inmates of an aviary ? I have some

they speak very highly ; but they know nothing of their habits, or whether
seed-eaters or insectivorous. One bird they call a Blue Crow, and the others

If you can in any way help me to tell my friends what to send, and
how to feed when caught and en route , I should be very much obliged
indeed. I am a young recruit in the avicultural world, and have only just

The following reply was sent to Air. Nicholson.
You have certainly been most successful with your Grassfinches this
summer, and I believe you are the first to breed Bathilda ruficauda -- success-
fully-- in this country, although young have been reared on several occasions
in France. I can find no previous record of young Rufous-tails being
reared so far as to be able to feed themselves, in Great Britain, although in
1897 a pair nested in the grass in Mr. St. Quin tin's aviary and two young
birds left the nest, but perished from exposure one cold night, two or three
days after (see Vol. V. p. 97). I have had nests built and eggs laid by this
species in my own aviary, but my pair were (or possibly one only was)
addicted to a habit which seems common to these birds, namely, egg-
eating, so that I was quite unsuccessful in my attempts to propogate the
species. You are to be heartily congratulated upon your success : six is a
splendid brood.
May I ask that you will give the readers of the " Avicultural
Magazine" a fuller account of your success?--How the nest was built, its
position, on what the young were fed, etc.
You have also been unusually successful with the hong-tails and
Goulds. D. Seth-SmiTh.

REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9953736" page_id="10098796"  page_num="235" year="" vol="">
1900-1901.
The total membership for this year shows a slight decrease
as compared with last year, the total number being 254 ; the
increase of subscription will probably account for the decrease;
but there must still be plenty of aviculturists who are not yet
members, and we hope all present members will do their best to
make more widely known the objects of the Society, and bring
recruits to its ranks.
The small amount of deficit, ^4--which still remained at
the end of last year--was wiped off through the kindness of
several members. There was, however, a small deficit on last
year's account, which will be easily met with the increased sub-
scription, and we shall hope to start our next year with a balance
in hand.
Volume VII. will not be quite as bulky as last year's
volume, which was by far the largest issued, but with that ex-
ception it will probably consist of more pages than an}&apos; of the
preceding volumes, and the Council hope that the matter con-
tained therein may have proved as interesting and useful as
hitherto.
Two coloured plates only have been issued during the
year ; this has not been owing to lack of funds but because it is
found more economical to print four plates on one stone. The
two other plates, therefore, which should have been issued this
year, have been held back for that reason, and we hope to issue
six plates before October, 1902. The first two ilhtstrated numbers
of Vol. VIII. will be forwarded post free to all paid up members
of the past, whether continuing as members for the ensuing year
or not.
A full-page photograph of some Cranes has been issued
during the year ; the Council had hoped to issue more photo-
graphs of members' aviaries and birds, but lack of material has
prevented the idea from being carried out.
The end of this year will again see changes in the staff of the
Magazine. Mr. Cressweel, your Editor, is obliged on account

of ill-health to resign the editorship. Arrangements with regard
to his successor are not yet made *, and we fear it may be a
difficult matter to find a worthy substitute, as editorial labours
are by no means light or easy. In accepting with regret his
resignation we tender him our best thanks, and trust that he will
long remain an active member and contribute to our Magazine.
At the end of this year also we lose as member, our
founder, Mr. H. R. Fillmer, who for five years practically ran
the Magazine, and nursed it with assiduous care during the early
days of its infancy. The labour involved in such an undertaking
can only be thoroughly appreciated by those who are following
in his footsteps, and we notice with great regret that Mr. Fielmer
now wishes to sever his connection with us.
Our thanks are due to those members--and we are glad to
notice several new contributors--who have filled the pages of the
Magazine with their avicultural experiences, and also to those
gentlemen who have kindly placed at our disposal drawings or
photographs for reproduction ; but especially are our thanks
owed to those Officers of the Society and Members of the
Executive Committee, who have discharged their duties to the
best of their ability and for the furtherance of the Society's
interest.

Mr. CROSS begs to state that it is now the season for Importing&apos; Hungarian Partridges.
These Birds are identical with the English Partridge; but are imported from Hungary.
They are unrelated to any bird in Great Britain, so that is is absolutely certain that new
blood is introduced, conducive to a numerous and strong progeny, thus preventing the
weakening or dying out of your stock.
N. B.--To prevent disappointment, orders should be sent early&apos;, on account of the
uncertainty of supply through severity of the weather.

" Under this title a notable addition lias been made to the series of
county avifaunas. It has for some time been known that the author was
engaged in its preparation, and the expectations of ornithologists in regard
to it have not been disappointed. We have examined it somewhat critically,
and find throughout its pages abundant evidence of the care which has been
bestowed upon it. A glance at the contents shows first a useful bibliography,
including both a list of books consulted and a list of periodicals and journals
which have furnished materials of one sort or another towards the making
of the volume. His ' Introduction ' is both geographical and bibliographi-
cal, and conveys a good impression of the natural features of the county
explored. These preliminaries pave the way for a catalogue of the birds of
the count}&apos; which naturally forms the bulk of the volume, and extends to

With Illustrations and a Map.
" Under this title a notable addition has been made to the series of
county avifaunas. It has for some time been known that the author was
engaged in its preparation, and the expectations of ornithologists in regard
to it have not been disappointed. We have examined it somewhat critically,
and find throughout its pages abundant evidence of the care which has been
bestowed upon it. A glance at the contents shows first a useful bibliography,
including both a list of books consulted and a list of periodicals and journals
which have furnished materials of one sort or another towards the making
of the volume. His ' Introduction ' is both geographical and bibliographi
cal, and conveys a good impression of the natural features of the county
explored. These preliminaries pave the way for a catalogue of the birds of
the count)&apos; which naturally forms the bulk of the volume, and extends to
some 350 pages. This is followed by a glossary of local names, and the
volume is completed by a good Index.
"With regard to the illustrations, half-a-dozen excellent 'photogravures'
give pleasing views of the Surrey Weald, Frensham Great Pond, Waverley
Abbey and Heronry, the Penn Ponds in Richmond Park, and Frensham
Little Pond. A dozen other illustrations reproduced from drawings em-
bellish the text at intervals, and a good map of the county is folded at the
end of the volume. Mr. Bucknill may well be complimented on the pro-
duction of a book which is not only artistic if considered aesthetically, but,
so far as we have been able to test it from the ornitholigists point of view,
extremely accurate and trustworthy ."--The Field.
