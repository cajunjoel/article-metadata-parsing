BREEDING THE LONG-TAILED DUCK

<bodyText confidence="0.975803054054054" page_id="56367172"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Derek Washington (East Grinstead, Sussex, England)
In 1971 Miss Betty Locker Lampson successfully reared two young
from a pair of Long-tailed Duck Clangula hyemalis in her waterfowl
collection at Copthorne, Sussex.
The parents were obtained as young birds from Mike Kitching in
1966. He had reared six that year from imported eggs. They were
transported from his collection at Louth when they were ten weeks
old. It was a very hot day, and the birds were carried in a cardboard box
on a train crowded with holidaymakers from Skegness. However, they
seemed unaffected by the journey and arrived safely in Sussex.
For two days they were kept in a pen at one corner of the lake. This
was a fenced enclosure about 20 yards across, and included a small part
of the lake. The duck appeared to be very fit and active, and so were
released on the lake to join the rest of the collection, an act performed
with some trepidation by their owner. She need not have worried
though, for the birds have thrived ever since. The male in particular
is an impressive bird. Not only does he have a series o f striking plumages
which change according to the time of year, but his lively nasal call is
most dramatic. An observer with eyes closed might be excused for
day-dreaming of far away places when hearing these notes together with
the " hooing " of Eiders also in the collection. Both male and female
have become quite tame and will swim within a yard or so for pieces of
fish and other tit-bits.
For the majority of their life these have been the only Long-tails in the
collection. In 1967 one male was raised from imported eggs (obtainable
until 1969 at a cost of about #1.50 each). This bird died nearly two
years later, but during this period no interaction was ever observed
between it and the pair.
I first became acquainted with the collection in 1968, and to start with
I had some difficulty in distinguishing the one-year old male from the
two-year female. In May however I noted that the female had a pale
stripe above the eye, whereas on the younger male this was more of a
pale patch. In August I noticed a variation of iris colour between the
three birds, the younger male and the female both being a darker brown
than the older male. Photographs taken in March 1969 show the older
male in a plumage which he has attained each winter since. His head

was pure white except for sharply defined black cheek patches. He had
some long pointed white feathers spread over the black of his back, and
his long black tail was fully developed. The younger male differed in
having a short tail, smudgy cheek patches and mottled brown and black
back. The female was similar but more brown than black with smaller
cheek patches and brown on top of the head as well.
During May 1968 the older male was seen chasing his female, often
underwater. This male was quite vociferous at the time, but by early
June his calls became less frequent. In the first few days of May 1969
the pair were seen mating, but nothing came of it. We thus had high
hopes for the 1970 season. However, the drake became so pre-occupied
with a lone female Red-breasted Merganser, Mergus senator , that he
completely ignored his own mate. To prevent this happening again the
Merganser was removed from the lake before the 1971 season.
During 1971 some display was noticed, particularly in the first few
days of June. Typically the male swims round the female with eiect
tail and neck, and bows the head whilst uttering his call. One day the
pair were seen some way from the water, which was unusual. They
appeared furtive after the manner of many breeding waterfowl in
captivity (and possibly in the wild too). Two days later a scrape was
discovered under some tall bamboos, several feet from the base of a
silver birch tree. This was an extremely dry site, well drained, with
plenty of dead bamboo leaves on the ground and a lot of cover overhead.
The nest was slightly raised up on bamboo leaves.
The site was visited only infrequently to avoid disturbing the birds.
Nothing happened for two weeks, but on 24th June one egg was found in
the scrape, well covered with bamboo leaves. Subsequent eggs were
laid on 26th, 27th, 29th June and 1st July five in all. The duck then
started to sit, lining the nest with down.
When the rest of the collection were fed, twice a day, the duck came
off to teed leaving her eggs well covered with down and bamboo leaves.
She always had a good bathe after the afternoon feed.
One egg was removed from the nest on 27th June and a second on
1 st July. These were put under a broody bantam and the duck was
left to incubate 3 eggs herself. She sat very well throughout. The
drake appeared to take no interest after the first egg had been laid, and
was hardly ever near her even when she came off to feed. During
incubation the nest area was roped off to remind us and the occasional
visitor to keep well clear. Previously we had frequently used a path
close to the nest to reach the far corner of the lake.
The two eggs under the bantam hatched on 27th July. The nest was
then examined and contained two bad eggs and one chipping. When the
nest was examined again, next day, this egg was missing. It was
subsequently found some distance away with the duckling dead inside.
It had presumably been carried there by either a Grey Squirrel or a

Moorhen, both of which were abundant (the latter especially have often
been seen raiding nests and entering nest barrels). Other active
predators were Jays, Magpies and Carrion Crows, but in our experience
these seem to concentrate on more open sites. The duck had by then
deserted the site and was on the lake, seeming very disconsolate.
After hatching, one of the two chicks was smaller than the other and
has remained so ever since. They were transferred with the bantam
from their sitting box to an enclosure in a concrete floored shed. The
enclosure measured 7 ft. x 5 ft. and was made from plastic netting on a
light wooden framework. The concrete floor was painted with a green
rubberised paint to present a soft washable surface. An open-fronted
coop was placed in the enclosure so that the hen could come out if she
chose. A 250 watt Philips infra-red lamp (a type with internal reflector
and red glass) was suspended two feet above the floor in front of the coop.
A foam plastic mat (from Woolworths) was put under the lamp, and a
folded hessian sack laid on a board under the coop. The sack and the
mat were changed daily.
A shallow pool with a sloping side was built into the floor of the
enclosure, and fresh water was flowed through this daily. A flat tray
also contained water, about \ in. deep. In this was floated duckweed,
and numerous insect larvae, water fleas etc. gathered from local pools,
This tray was also placed under the lamp.
The lamp was left running all day, but was turned off at night and the
birds were shut in the coop. At about mid-day, when the sun was
highest, the lamp was raised an inch or two until it was about 4 feet above
the ground after two weeks. It was then turned off permanently.
No artificial food was given for 36 hours. Then a little hard boiled
egg yolk and some Turkey starter crumbs were sprinkled on the mat and
on to the backs of the ducklings. The food was always given dry, and
anything uneaten was thrown away before the next feed. After the second
day a few mealworms were pinched in half and thrown on to the mat and
in the shallow water dish. These proved very popular; once the chicks
were a week or so old the mealworms were given whole.
The birds remained in this enclosure for three weeks. They were then
transferred to an outdoor pen approximately 12 ft. x 12 ft. in size. The
wire-netting walls were rendered opague at ground level by corrugated
iron panels and the like. The floor of the pen was grass and it contained
a coop for shelter. There was also a pool about 3 ft. across by 15 ins. deep
fed for a few hours daily by water pumped from a well. The incoming
water was allowed to splash into the pool by feeding it to the top of some
stone slabs piled at one side so that some of them overhang the surface.
This splashing seemed to stimulate the ducklings to bathe, thus
encouraging waterproofing at an early age. There was also a grass
covered hummock on which they liked to sit and several boards were
laid on the ground as resting places.

The features considered important in rearing Long-tailed Duck to this
stage are warmth, feeding and seclusion in that order. It is finally
necessary to ensure the birds are waterproof before transferring them to a
pond or lake. These birds (both males) remained in the outdoor pen
together for 5 weeks, by this time the larger duckling had become
completely waterproof. He was taken to a deep pool upstream of the
main lake where he will remain all winter, whilst the other will remain
in the outdoor pen until it too is waterproof. The birds were fed on
growers pellets mixed with soaked puppy meal during this peroid.
Chopped up Sprats were placed in a dish of water, and mealworms,
duckweed and grit were also given.
Long-tailed Duck are among the most difficult of the sea duck to rear,
and great patience is needed with them. However the results can be
very rewarding.
It is believed that this may be the first record of Long-tailed Duck
reared anywhere from captive laid eggs.

BREEDING THE MOLUCCAN COCKATOO
(Cacatua moluccensis)
By Neil O'Connor (Coulsdon, Surrey, England)

The original birds were purchased in February 1967, on the day they
arrived in London from Hongkong. Both birds were very steady and
although the cock did not welcome close approach he did not show signs
of extreme resentment. The hen would readily accept tit-bits from my
hand and I am of the opinion that she had been a pet bird prior to importa-
tion. She never seemed satisfied with her diet and always appeared to
be searching for something which the seed mixture did not contain, and
scattered the contents of the food pots with sideways flicks of her beak.
She got very thin and, despite veterinary attention, died in June 1967.
She was the only bird which was positively identifiable as a hen in the
consignment of six which the dealer received.
The cock was put in an outside aviary in June and another bird pur-
chased during the same month. Although freshly imported, it was so
enraged at being caged that it was transferred to the outside aviary two
days after purchase. It immediately flew on to the perch and snuggled
up to the cock; both birds quite clearly enjoyed each other's presence.
The new arrival was truly a magnificent specimen possessed of a savage
splendour the like of which I have rarely seen. It also turned out to have
a truly magnificent voice the like of which I have never heard. In April

1968 he--it was another cock--was transferred to a friend's aviary about
five miles away, barely out of earshot.
Within a few days a replacement was found and this bird was quite
obviously a hen. She had been caged in a pet shop for some months
and was tame enough to offer her head for scratching. She was put
outside with the cock in mid-May 1968. She immediately snuggled up
to him and within seconds--when they were unaware of being observed--
a mutual preening session commenced. This hen likes to exercise her
voice fairly frequently in the very early mornings and again in the evenings
but usually its intensity and duration are tolerable. When the noise
exceeds the allotted time it is put to an immediate stop by a device which
is controlled from the house. The cock has never uttered a sound save
when on a few occasions the hen put slightly too much beak pressure on
one of his toes.
The aviary is 15 ft. x 5 ft. x 6 ft. high and is constructed of wood
protected by metal strips. It is double-wired with 2 in. x 2 in. heavy
gauge chain link on the inside and 1 in. x J in. welded mesh on the
outside. The latter is primarily intended to keep sparrows out. The
floor is grass which is kept cut. The shelter is open-fronted and is
5 ft. long. This aviary is not one of a series of flights but stands on its
own and the Moluccans cannot see the occupants of the other aviaries.
Two food pots are used, one containing sunflower seed and the other a
mixture of roughly 50% canary seed, the balance being made up in equal
proportions of white millet, paddy rice, buckwheat, hemp, wheat, oats,
groats and maize. A few drops of Abidec multivitamin solution are put
in the drinking water once weekly if remembered and spinach beet,
dandelion, apple and carrot are also provided. Cuttlefish bone is largely
if not wholly wasted; I have never known them to sample the contents of
the grit pot and this has been removed--probably a mistake to do so.
A nest-box was provided in May 1968, soon after the acquisition of the
hen. It was hung high in the shelter, under cover but in line with the
edge. No interest was displayed in the box.
In mid-January 1969, the hen was seen crouching and edging up to
the cock which merely made him move further along the perch until he
reached the wire when he stepped over her back only to be edged back to
the other side. Finally, he stepped on her back and made a half-hearted
attempt at pairing, all the time looking coy and indignant at being
inveigled into performing an act in the flight which in the interests of
modesty and decorum should be performed in the privacy of the shelter.
She was a good and persistent solicitor; his modesty and decorum have
long since vanished. Later that month, the hen was seen in the next-
box, a visit which necessitated some fortification. More rotten wood
was placed in the box in May, much of which was promptly ejected.
Pairing was observed again in June and was frequently observed from

then on until October, always in the early morning. Much the same
ritual was observed during 1970. 1
The dimensions of the nest-box are 20 in. x 15 in. x 10 in. with a 5 in. i
diameter hole the top of which is 7 in. from the top of the box. Although
made to a specification suggested by a renowned aviculturist, I always
considered the hole to be too low bearing in mind the overall dimensions
of the box. Consequently, the box--which was taken down for the
winter months--was reversed, a fresh hole being put nearer to the top
and the original hole which was now in the back was blocked up. This
afforded the birds a greater degree of privacy which was probably the
main factor which induced them to go to nest. The box is covered both
inside and outside with welded mesh; the edges and the entrance hole are
protected with aluminium strips. It was re-hung in exactly the same
position in March 1971.
Pairing was observed in April and both birds were spending a lot of
time in the box. Sometimes the cock spent the whole day in the box
and slept there at night also. Some rotten wood was ejected. By early
May both birds were spending most of the day in the box; the cock
usually roosted in the shelter at night having emerged from the box at or
after dusk. The birds never left the box unattended--one always remained
inside. This pattern continued throughout May; the birds were rarely
seen and when one or the other emerged it was for a quick visit to the
food tray. The hen was rather threatening if the aviary was approached
during one of her short periods out of the box. I might add that whilst
she was fairly tame when purchased, her tameness disappeared immedi-
ately on release in the aviary.
The sound of young was first heard on 8th June. Soaked sunflower
and soaked oats were offered, neither was touched nor was hard-boiled
egg. Peanuts were always fed sparingly or not at all but a fistful was now
given each day and they disappeared rapidly. Plenty of carrot and
spinach beet were given each day and these also disappeared rapidly.
The birds continued to spend all day in the box. On 24th July a little
maintenance became necessary in the aviary and the opportunity was
taken to inspect the box. One chick was seen but as both adult birds
were inside the chick was partly hidden. Earlier, on the same day, both
adult birds were seen out of the box together for the first time since
incubation commenced.
On 26th July both birds were out of the box at 6 p.m. and another
inspection was made. Although within 4 ft. of me, they made no attempt
to attack but showed slightly more displeasure than usual when I entered
the aviary. Only one chick was in the box, also showing his displeasure
by swaying gently from side to side with beak open. Still in the pin-
feather stage, the salmon colour of the crest was visible. The most
striking thing about the young bird was its enormous legs and feet which
seemed out of proportion to its body.

At about this time--late July--the hen recommenced to herald the
dawn, something we all had missed since incubation commenced. Both
birds were frequently seen in the flight together in the early mornings.
On 7th and nth August, the box was again inspected and this revealed a
very well-grown chick which gave a very loud shout when I put my hand
too close to it. Again, the parent birds made no attempt to attack.
On Sunday, 29th August, carrot fed earlier in the day was hardly
touched at 5 p.m. Both birds were in the shelter and the box was again
inspected. The chick was well developed and fat; it has a very fine crest
and well-grown flights, the tail was very short--not more than ijin.;
it was dead, 82 days after we first knew of its arrival. It was removed
from the box and--very surprisingly--both adult birds roosted in the box
that night; the box was taken down on the following day.
Owing to the August Bank Holiday, it was not possible to despatch
the chick for post-mortem until Tuesday and although the package was
sent by express post to Wickham Laboratories it was not possible for
them to reach a conclusion owing to the advanced state of decomposition.
The birds were again observed pairing on 8th September; perhaps
their efforts and mine will be more successful in 1972.

BREEDING THE MALABAR STARLING

I was interested to note in the current issue of the A.M. that Raymond
Franklin had bred the Malabar Starling Sturnus malabaricus.
I would like to record that I bred one youngster in 1971. I purchased
the cock bird at least ten years ago, and the hen not long afterwards.
They went through that very hard winter of 1962/63, in an aviary with
an outdoor flight 12 ft. x 6 ft. and with a heated indoor flight attached
into which they could go when cold, together with a lot of other softbills
that made up my collection. In August 1969, I moved to a house
having plenty of ground and I built an aviary with the flight 25 ft. x 8 ft.
x 7 ft. having a house attached 12 ft. x 8 ft. half of this being a wire
flight. The house is heated by tubular heaters controlled by Thermostat
kept at 45*-5o* F.
The Malabars are housed with my rather large collection of Softbills

Vented Bulbul, Rosy Pastor, Coppersmith Barbet, d'Arnaud's Barbet,
and a Pair of Gold Fronted Fruit-suckers. As the above collection
mainly consists of cock birds my interest in them is for their beauty in a
garden Aviary, although I have bred for two years some Zosterops.
Last May I hollowed a log of poplar, the finished box being 16 ins.
deep by about 7 ins. inside diameter with an entrance hole ins. in
size. This I hung up at the far end of the flight which is heavily planted.
All the years that I have had the Malabars they have never shown any
interest in one another, and I was always in doubt if I did have a true
pair, although the one was of much brighter colour than the other, as
was his vocal ability, he being a good mimic-imitating a cat, Jackdaw,
and a lovely Wolf Whistle.
I did not observe any mating display or any nesting material being
carried to the nest by either bird, but one day in early June I saw the hen
come out of the log nest. This prompted me to unscrew the box off the
framework of the flight and as the top was firmly nailed on I had to look
inside with the aid of a small mirror. I could see two blue eggs in the
bottom of the box. The nest consisted of green leaves, small twigs and
grass, not much of a nest for a Starling. When these eggs were laid I
have no idea and as my habit is to shut my birds in every night, both
Summer and Winter, I cannot imagine how these two eggs ever hatched;
for each evening as I went to the aviary she would go in with all the other
birds and the eggs would be left uncovered each night.
Not ever seeing the cock bird take any interest in the hen or the nest
box I thought the hen was just going through the motions of nesting and
that the eggs could not be fertile. However one day in late June I saw the
hen taking a beakful of mealworms into the box, so I had a look inside
and saw one young one that would be about two days old. The next
day I looked and there were two young. After this inspection I left
them alone for two weeks. Then on looking again I could only see one
large young one with eyes open and well feathered, and no sign of the
other one.
The remaining young one grew well and left the nest on 27th July.
After I found that there were young in the nest I would shut all the birds
in at night including the hen then open the shutter a few inches and the
hen would come out and go into the nest box and brood the young one
for the night. The hen did all the feeding, the cock bird never once
going near the nest box. The young bird left the nest in good weather
and the hen still continued to feed him for quite a long while until he
could feed himself. She reared him on mealworms, maggots, softfood,
and any insects that could be found in the aviary. I disposed of him in
October last. I regret that I cannot give any dates or more details as to
this breeding but it was carried out in such a haphazard manner.

BREEDING THE YELLOW-BREASTED
BUNTING AT CHESTER ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993798268292683" page_id="56367182"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
(Ember iz a aureola)
By William H. Timmis, Curator of Birds and Mammals
The Yellow-Breasted Bunting is a very strikingly coloured bird. In
the adult male the forehead, ear-coverts, cheeks, surround of the eye
and throat are black; the rest of the crown and entire upper parts are
dark chestnut, with a narrow chestnut band across the breast, dividing
the bright yellow crop from the yellow breast and underparts. The
wings are dark brown with two broad white bands, and the whole of the
lesser coverts and tips of the greater coverts are white. The tail is dark
brown with a white wedge on the outermost feathers; this is noticeable
only in flight.
The female is plain yellow above, without any band across the breast;
white wing-bars are present, as in the male; the outer tail feathers show
an amount of white during flight, the white wedge being concealed when
the tail is closed. Unlike so many of the Buntings which are on the
British list, the Yellow-Breasted has no white or yellow face stripes.
This interesting Bunting has a vast breeding range which extends
from northern Finland, where I understand it is comparatively scarce,
eastwards through Russia and Siberia to the Kirghiz Steppes, east through
north-west Mongolia and on to northern Japan. It winters in south-
eastern Asia, Burma, Assam, Nepal, Northern Thailand, the Malay
States and China, extending on to Formosa. As a vagrant it has occurred
in many European countries, reaching the Atlantic in France, Heligoland,
Holland and the British Isles. Two sub-species are recognised, the
Eastern or Ussuri White-Shouldered Bunting (Ember iza aureola ornata)
being darker above and richer below.
Four pairs of Yellow-Breasted Buntings were purchased from a local
dealer on the 5th July 1971 and after two weeks' acclimatisation were
liberated in our large Tropical House. This house is 240 feet long,
200 feet wide and 40 feet high and it contains fountains, waterfalls and
pools, and is very heavily planted with tropical vegetation. Plants
include Banana and Palm Trees, Pineapples, Pomegranates, Lemons, a
large collection of Hibiscus, over 200 varieties of Crotons, Clerodendrons,
Bougainvilleas, Passifloras, Gardenias, tree ferns and tropical climbers
in profusion.
About one week later I noticed that one pair had established a territory,
the boundaries of which could be defined by the location of song perches.
Boundaries were defended by aggressive behaviour which ranged from
soft warning calls to furious attacks. Perches used for territorial
advertising included Colocasia antiquorum , Cyperus alternafolius
Xanthosoma volaceum , all of which are around a large pool; also used

W. H. TIMMIS--BREEDING THE YELLOW-BREASTED BUNTING
were a very tall Dracaena lindenii and a small Dracaena kewensis , both of
these being some distance away.
The only conflict noted was on 3rd August when a male tried to settle
in the occupied territory and after a great deal of aggression by both the
male and female the intruder finally left, leaving the original pair in
full possession. With other species that came into the area, such as
Hummingbirds, Laughing Thrushes, Magpie Starlings and Yellow-
shouldered Whydahs to name but a few, the Yellow-Breasted Bunting
was not particularly aggressive in defence of its territory. Only when
another bird came near to the nest did the pair show marked belligerence.
The male, or the female, or both together, would rush the intruder and
drive it away. There was a tendency for the male to advertise territory
while the female attacked the trespasser. The male tended to be
concerned with the entire territory while the female was concerned with
the nest proper. In most territorial disputes, aggressive displays often
were effective without physical contact. The territory was abandoned
after the last fledgling had been safely hidden at a considerable distance
from the nest.
The nest was built at ground level among a dense clump of Asparagus
spengerii with clusters of leaves concealing it from above, although it
could be seen from the side and below. It was very close to a large pool
and a pathway used by visitors, and was little more than a scantily lined
hollow. Materials used included dead grasses, a few small leaves with
finer grasses and a little hair which had been collected in our Mountain
Gorilla enclosure. Both male and female appeared to take part in nest
building, and the male, from my observations, took the initiative and did
most of the work for the first three days, then the female took over and
completed the nest. The male accompanied her when she went after
materials and upon returning he sat on his advertising perch while the
hen worked below. It would seem that the male selects the site for the
nest and that the female, after much exploring both alone and accompanied
by the male, finally settles on the site originally selected by him.
On the 12th August one egg was observed in the nest. This was a
broad oval shape with a great deal of gloss, greyish-green in colour,
blotched and smeared with olive-brown, with some underlying light
grey and some spots and short lines of deep brown or black. The egg
measured 20.51 x 15.01 mm.
I was away from the zoo for about three days after the first egg had
been laid and upon my return found four eggs in the nest and the male
sitting. The following day a fifth egg appeared and for the next 13 days
I only saw the female incubating. On two occasions the female used
injury-feigns when she was disturbed, running off along the ground
dragging both wings before flying up into the highest vegetation to watch
the intruder.

Three eggs hatched after an incubation period of 13 days from the
laying of the fifth egg. It is now generally agreed that the incubation
period should be considered the time from the laying of the last egg to
the hatching of the last young when all eggs in the clutch hatch. Both
sexes brooded and fed the young, chiefly on insects which had to be
collected by the keepers. These included beetles, caterpillars, moths,
hover-flies, craneflies, maggots, small earth-worms and locust hoppers
which are bred in the zoo, plus mealworms. From what I could observe,
a small amount of regurgitated seed was fed. When feeding the young
the pair, in turn, poked from one gaping throat to the other in a fast and
regular rhythm. The nearer a chick was to a parent, the more feedings it
received. Faecal sacs were eaten by both parents during the first few
days but later were carried considerable distances and dropped.
The young left the nest after fifteen days and looked very much like
the adult female, but paler feathered. The parents continued to feed
the three young for about two weeks, after which they appeared to lose
all interest. At this stage the young were able to feed themselves. At
the time of writing, 7th November 1971, one of the chicks has vanished
but the remaining two can be seen at the feeding bays early in the
mornings and late afternoons.
As described above the Yellow-Breasted Bunting has been bred at
Chester Zoo. It is believed this may be a first success. Any member
or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species in Great Britain
or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at once with the Hon.
Secretary.

THE BREEDING OF JERDON'S STARLING
(Sturnus burmanicus)
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England)
Jerdon's Starlings range through central Burma. From Smythie in his
" Birds of Burma " it is described as follows: " Length 10 in, head and
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9927719" page_id="56367184"  page_num="11" year="" vol="">
breast dirty white, upper parts dark grey, underparts purplish. The
plumage varies greatly with the seasons but the red tipped bill is usually
noticeable. The Jerdon's Starling is a typical dry zone bird of scrub
jungle country." I would say that my birds measure up to this description
but the red tipped bill is absent.
I purchased a presumed pair of Jerdon's Starlings from a High Wycombe
dealer in November, 1969. During the following winter they were
housed in my birdroom with other Starlings, in a 12 ft. flight. At the
end of Maich, 1970 they were put outside into a flight 15 ft. x 6 ft. x 6 ft.
planted with bamboo etc.; with a small pond for bathing and drinking.

On the 24th April I hung a log nest box high up at one end of the flight,
the log being a branch of black poplar rotten in the centre and leaving a
hole about 4 in. in diameter.
About a fortnight later the cock bird was seen carrying green grass and
dead leaves into the log. The hen did not seem to do any of the work--
but occasionally peered into the log to see how things were progressing.
The only display I ever saw was a peculiar bobbing of the head in the
male and a spreading of the tail feathers for a few seconds followed by a
gurgling sound whereat the hen would rush up to him and put her beak to
his. On the 31st May as I had not seen the hen for a day or so I took a
torch and looked into the log. On seeing two fine pale blue eggs I noted
the date and waited for what I hoped would be a hatching. On the 21st
June what appeared to be three smashed and partially eaten eggs were seen
on the flight floor about 12ft. from the log. I can only presume the
cock bird had brought the eggs out. I cannot say if they were fertile.
The birds seemed to lose interest after that, so during the first week of
July I took the old nest out of the log to see if they would start again.
Within a few days they started to stuff the log with more grass and dead
leaves again. They subsequently abandoned the effort; so that was the
end of attempts at breeding for 1970. At no time was copulation
observed.
To start the 1971 season--on the 3rd April I hung a larger hollow log
of poplar in the flight. Not much interest seemed to be shown but on
the 24th April I found two broken eggs in the flight. I suspect they
must have been carried out by the cock as they were not broken very
much. During the second week of May the hen was in the log for long
periods from which I surmized that she must have eggs. I was wrong.
She remained in the log on and off until the 8th June when I decided it
was time to take a look, as I thought that by now there should be young.
On turning out the mass of grass and feathers etc. there were no eggs, so
what had been happening I do not know.
After this I thought perhaps a change of house might do the trick so I
replaced the log with a large parakeet nest box 30 inches long by 9 in. x
9 in., hung up almost horizontally, but slightly tilted so that the nest end
was a little lower than the entrance hole. The cock showed immediate
interest by loud calls and repeatedly popping his head in and out of the
hole. During the following fortnight he built what might be called a
nest but it was really only an untidy mess consisting of green grass, a few
feathers and a few dead leaves. I would imagine the green grass provides
heat and humidity. This time I saw very little display by the cock, but
the hen was in the box on and off during the day. On the 25th June I
decided to take a look and I was pleased to find one pale blue egg of usual
starling size. Incidentally I frequently enter my flights and my birds
get used to me and do not panic unduly.

On the 12th July I heard faint squeaks from the box and the parents
were agitatedly looking for extra food, so from then on I kept out of the
flight for fear of disturbing them. Extra food was supplied of course,
the usual mealworms and maggots being supplemented with insects
brought home from expeditions into the countryside with a large net. I
consider live food absolutely essential for at no time did I see the parents
feed any soft food at all to the young.
On the morning of the 31st July three young came out and flapped
feebly around. They were duller editions of the parents but one feature
I noticed was that the inside of the mouth was a lemon yellow in colour
against the black mouth of the parents, (presumably to attract the parents
to feed them). Unfortunately, one died on the first day, and one
appeared to have rickets and after a week or so I decided to kill it. With
less to feed the remaining baby progressed well. After a fortnight I
took the young bird away as the cock was becoming aggressive towards
it. The young bird was beginning to feed itself so I decided it would be
safe.
On the 16th August the cock was seen adding new material to the old
nest. I looked in the box again and found two eggs on the 18th August.
The weather was rather hot that week so I sprayed both the aviary and
the nest box with the garden hose.
On the 29th August I again heard squeaking from the box so it was
back again to supplying insects and extras. After three weeks of hot
weather the young bird (it was only one this time) was just beginning to
peep out of the hole and was continually being called to come out by the
parents; but as it seemed very reluctant to put in an appearance and the
old nest was becoming rather unwholesome I decided to take the baby out
of the box on the 19th September. This time there was one baby and
an addled egg. The baby perched well but was rather a weak flyer.
This time the cock was rather aggressive and I considered moving him
but decided against this as it might upset the sequence of feeding, etc.
The hen was doing all the feeding now and I had to stand by the food
dish until she had taken sufficient for her and the baby before allowing
the cock to feed. He became extremely agitated at this. On the 8th
October I removed the baby as it seemed to be feeding itself, and also
because of the cock's bad temper.
I now have two fine young Jerdon's Starlings which are coming along
quite nicely to date (mid-November 1971). To sum up, I think my
main difficulty was, of course, supplying food, as I am at work all day;
but at midday my wife would put a quantity of mealworms and maggots
in the flight. I attribute this successful breeding to quite considerable
amounts of live flies, caterpillars and similar creatures, which I was able
to obtain with the use of a large entomologist's sweep net, and, of course,
to the long warm days of this particular summer.

For some time I have restricted my small collection essentially to
five species, Roseate ( Elophus roseicapillus) and Citron-crested Cockatoos
(Cacatua citrinocristata ), Swainson's lorikeets ( Trichoglossus heamatodus
moluccanus) Dwarf Turtle doves ( Streptopelia tranquebarica) and Swinhoe's
pheasants ( Lophura szvinhoei ), all of which have bred with fair success
for a number of years.
Of the Roseates, the old pair hatched and reared four after the initial
loss of a clutch of eggs, probably as the result of the intrusion of a grey
squirrel. The hen of the second pair laid six or seven eggs at intervals
in the shelter and showed no disposition to sit. Miraculously I was able
to foster five unbroken eggs with other cockatoos but none appeared to
be fertile.
Of three pairs of Citron-crests. One hatched and reared two young,
a second (including a cock that first bred here in 1955) reared one (I
believe there were originally two). The third pair comprised my
foundation hen (she also first bred for me in 1955) and one of her sons
(hatched in 1957). For the last two seasons she had laid but had been
attacked by the cock and been separated without incubating. This year
I was abroad at the critical time and she was found dead, probably
murdered. I happened to have a home-bred hen of the Timor race of
the Lesser Sulphur-crest (Cacatua parvula ) so paired her in April with
the young widower. They promptly went to nest and reared two beautiful
young which seem indistinguishable from one of the Lesser Sulphur-crest
races. They are bigger than the Timor, with long elegant sulphur
yellow crests. After the young emerged all four remained in the breeding
aviary in apparent amity until, due to the appearance of a predator in the
garden, I had to shut them into the small shelter. On the third night
the cock slew his second wife. The young were not of course self-
supporting but to my relief and amazement the father proved a model
parent and they continued to thrive.
Close confinement of a breeding pair of cockatoos can be dangerous
(I lost a hen Leadbeater's one December after shutting the pair inside
when cleaning the aviary) but it is certainly not always so and I regularly
have some pairs in large cages during the winter.
The Swainson's lorikeets comprise two separated pairs, and a colony
of six to ten birds, depending on disposals. The separated pairs breed
regularly throughout the year. The colony has produced a few young.
Whether the comparative lack of success is because more than one pair
is present or whether there are other reasons I am not sure.
My Dwarf Turtledoves (a very delightful species) have become reduced
in numbers and by 1970 I had only one hen about which I could feel

optimistic. Importation seems curiously erratic but in 1970 some
arrived and were advertised as the Burmese race, which I understood
to be darker and more richly coloured than the Indian which I believed
mine to be. I bought a pair and was interested to note that although
the cock didn't seem very different from those in my stock the hen was
quite dark (brown rather than grey). Twelve months and many rains
later I am undecided whether I have a pale cock or an ancient hen. I
would not have believed it was possible to be confused about the sexes in
this species, the marked difference being one of its admirable character-
istics. However the imported cock justified the transaction and by the
end of next season (dare I say it?) my stock should be safe again.
I let the Swinhoe's pheasants incubate and rear on their own and they
prove excellent parents. Since one is under no compulsion with this
species to produce as many as possible, bantams can be excluded, as a
consequence some of the diseases, particularly histomoniasis, which are
common to chickens and pheasants, can be avoided.
This has been a successful year for me, the main reason being, I am
sure, that I do limit the number of birds and in particular the number of
species I keep. Self discipline in regard to new acquisitions can be very
hard at times but even with the very limited number of birds I keep I
often have more than enough to do.

NOTES ON SOME AFRICAN STARLINGS

I was adding up the other day all the species of starling I have kept over
the past few years and came to the very surprising total of 23 species in
all. All these I have kept either here at the Harewood Bird Garden or
whilst I was with W. R. Partridge at Evesham.
I thought perhaps readers might be interested in my briefly running
through the African section of the list with a few comments on each
I will start with the one perhaps most aviculturalists are familiar with
and this is the Spreo Starling, Spreo superbus. Coming from East
Africa, a very friendly confiding bird in the wild, a habit it retains well in
captivity. I have kept and bred this bird on a few occasions, most
recently this year at Harewood. I started with a group of nine birds in
the aviary, but over a period of eight or nine months several birds had to
be removed from the avairy after each in turn was picked on and victimised
by the others. When we arrived at five birds, we seemed to have reached
the right level and all went well from then on. They have never interfered
with four Green Winged Doves and a pair of Vermilion Cardinals in the
same aviary, but a pair of Cedar Waxwings had to be removed within
hours to save their lives. I have found that the Spreo, along with the

have kept. For some reason, the answer of which I am not sure, I have

never managed to produce more than one young from each nest of this
species.
The Chestnut Bellied Starling, Spreo pulcher, was the very first of |
this family I ever dealt with. We had three of these which had two nest
boxes. The nest boxes were permanently full of grass and leaves, etc.,
and there was much to-ing and fro-ing but no eggs were ever laid, I am
not sure what eventually happened to these birds but we persevered for &amp;apos;
some years with them. The Chestnut Bellied is very much like the
Spreo Starling except that it lacks white on the chest and vent and the
head is brownish rather than black as in the Spreo, and if I remember
correctly the glossyness and iridescence was not so pronounced as in the
Spreo.
The Amethyst Starling, Cinnyricinclus leucog aster, one of my favourites,
is a Starling I have never been without for very long over recent years.
Unlike most Starlings the cock and hen are so vastly different that people
who do not know are amazed to discover them to be cock and hen of the
same species. Basically the cock is a vivid iridescent gunmetal violet-blue
on the head and all upper parts, whilst underneath it is pure white, the
hen on the other hand is brown above and white with heavy streaking
of brown on the chest, a very thrush-like bird. I consider these birds
as being nearly impossible to breed (Mr. Cummings formerly of Keston will
smile at this as he bred them some years ago), for although I have kept
them for several years I have never even got them to look at a nest box.
They seem perfectly content to feed and just sit around in their aviary.
I have now imported some fresh birds and am starting all over again to
try to breed them. The cocks, seen against the right light, never fail
to draw admiring comments from our visitiors.
The Magpie Starling, Speculipistor bicolor is a Starling which I think
very few people will be familiar with. It has been rarely imported into
this country. It has a very limited range in East Africa. Whilst with
W. R. Partridge two pairs of them were imported and within a year of
their arrival in this country we managed to breed three young in two
nests, two in the first and one in the second, for what was I think a world
first breeding in captivity. The male has a glossy black head, chest and
back with creamy white underparts, whilst the female has a dark grey
head and chest, the back being black and underparts creamy as in the
male. The most distinctive feature of the Magpie Starling is its bright
fiery-red eye.
Sharpe's Starling, Pholia sharpii, I cannot really tell much about as
I have only very recently imported two pairs of this interesting little
Starling from East Africa, and these are the first I have ever seen. I
should doubt very much if they have often been imported before. Side
by side with Amethyst Starlings one sees an immediate difference in

character for whilst the Amethyst are shy and flighty, the Sharpe's has
a very placid nature, never flying around in the agitated manner of many
freshly imported birds. When I received them the first thing I noticed
was the short broad beak, rather like a swallow's, this suggesting they are
hawkers of flying insects or very frugivorous. They certainly can
demolish a nice ripe pear. In size they are similar to Amethyst, quite a
small Starling. The entire upper parts are black with a slight deep
bluish iridescence whilst the under parts from the bill to vent are slightly
huffish white. The sexes are identical in colour but two of my birds
have a bright yellow iris, whilst the other two have dark eyes. Whether
this difference is sexual or a sign of immaturity in the darker ones, we
shall have to wait and see.
Fischer's Starling, Spreo fischeri. I came across these by accident as
the dealer who imported them had no idea what they were and liked them
even less. I must admit they are not a particularly exciting bird but
I do consider them quite neat and attractive. Basically they are grey
above and from the chest downwards pure white. The head is lighter
grey than the wings and back. My birds remain fit and well but have
shown no interest, as yet, in going to nest. They are a little larger than
Spreo Starlings, being more elongated in shape.
Glossy Starlings. Africa is the home of a good many species of Glossy
Starlings, and several are so very much alike that identification is a problem,
not only in the field but also when the birds arrive in this country in
captivity. Some years ago we received a pair of Glossy Starlings from
East Africa and it was some time before they were eventually identified
for certain as Lesser Blue-Eared Glossy Starlings , Lamprocolius chloropterus.
They were quite immaculate when received and like all this family
stayed in perfect condition with no effort but showed no interest in
nesting. They were quite slight birds, much slimmer in build than the
commonly imported Purple Glossy Starling, L. purpureus , being an over
all iridescent green with definite blue cheeks and ears.
The only West African species of this group I have kept are the common
Purple Glossy Starling which I persevered with for three years before
giving them up. I had a group which always stayed together in the
aviary but, although in superb condition, they displayed no interest at
all in the boxes I provided.
The Wattled Starling, Creatophora carunculata , in many ways perhaps
the most interesting Starling, is for over half the year one of the most
colourless drab birds it is possible to imagine being an over all mouse
grey with darker primaries, full stop! On delving a little deeper one
finds that the male during the breeding season loses all his head feathers
to expose bright yellow flesh and he develops an extraordinary black
lobe or wattle from his chin which in an old bird may be over an inch
long. The breeding habits of this bird are quite unlike any other African
Starling in that they build a magpie-like nest of twigs, often in groups

which will fill the top of a tree. Locusts form the bulk of their diet and
one of their habits is to follow locust swarms stopping to breed only
when the locusts breed. It would be interesting to find out how the
Wattled Starling fares now that the locusts are so much controlled by
man. I succeeded in breeding and rearing one youngster this year (1971),
having tried since 1963 with the same pair. (This must be some kind
of a record).
The African Starling group holds for me some strange fascination
and I have at the moment only scratched the surface. There is the
gorgeous Royal Starling, the beautiful burnished Splendid Glossy
Starling, a whole range of Red Winged Starlings, the unusual White-
Crowned Starling, the slender long-tailed Ashy Starling of Tanzania or
the delightful little Emerald Starling from West Africa and a good many
more. None of these have I yet kept, all I would most certainly like to.
Apart from their beauty these birds have many points to recommend
them to aviculturalists. They are quite tough, being relatively easy to
acclimatize and keep. Their food requirements present no difficulties
and as far as I am concerned, perhaps most important of all, they are
amongst the most breedable of all soft-billed birds.

HYBRID MACAW FROM A MATING OF
ARA MACAO AND ARA CHLOROPTERA
AT NEWQUAY ZOO
By R. A. Harper (for Peter Lowe, Curator. Newquay Zoo, Cornwall,
England)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99462725" page_id="56367191"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
The parent birds represented in this breeding were two four year old
Macaws; the cock being the Red and Yellow, Ara macao , the hen the
Green Winged (or Red and Blue) Macaw, A. chloroptera.
The birds first became friendly at the pets corner at Newquay Zoo
where several Macaws are kept with clipped wings and allowed to wander
over a large area during the day, being taken indoors for the night. The
cock is a completely tame specimen; the hen not tame enough to handle
but used to human company.
During the late spring of this year (1971), the two birds were seen to
be indulging in much mutual preening and feeding and were then presumed
to be a pair; however no nest box was provided for them and the nearby
trees offered nothing in the way of nest sites so it seemed unlikely that the
pair could ever begin to breed.
After some weeks the birds discovered a cement cave at the rear of a
run intended for rabbits and guinea pigs the entrance to which is at
ground level. The Macaws soon ousted the rodents from this cave and

<bodyText confidence="0.999750577777778" page_id="56367192"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
from then on this became their headquarters. A layer of peat was
placed on the floor of the cave and in this the birds dug a shallow nest
scrape. Surrounding the run is a fence and on the top rail of this the
two Macaws spent much time, mating was observed on this rail several
times.
An egg was laid on the 30th May and a second on the 3rd June. On
27th June the eggs were inspected and it was found that both were fertile,
one had a chick dead in the shell, the other was hatching but the chick
died shortly after emerging.
The pair were seen mating on the 29th June and the hen went to nest
again three weeks later this time laying three eggs all of which hatched
at day intervals on the 14th, 15th and 16th of August.
One of the chicks was found dead and mutilated after two days, the
other two appeared to be prospering and being fed by the parents. It
soon became obvious however that one chick was rapidly outgrowing the
other and two weeks after hatching the smaller of the remaining two
chicks was found dead from causes which seemed to denote starvation.
The remaining chick continued to prosper and whilst unfeathered it was
constantly under the protection of the parents; once the chick was
feathered however the parents spent long hours away from the nest. It
is interesting to note in passing that both parents spent the night in the
cave although there are no perches and the cock must have slept on the
floor beside the brooding hen.
After one hundred and three days the young Macaw left the nest and
climbed onto the rail for the first time.
During the incubation period the adult Macaws were very aggressive
towards human intruders and in particular towards people that they
knew such as their keeper; the nest was inspected at infrequent intervals,
for the most part the birds were left to their own devices and undisturbed.
The Macaws at Newquay receive a wide variety of foods including an
assortment of fruit, nuts, sponge cake soaked in honey, minced raw meat
and a seed mixture containing sunflower, peanuts, canary seed and millet.
During the period that the breeding pair were feeding young they consumed
large quantities of the honey soaked sponge cake and also took more meat
than normal.
In nearly every detail the young bird resembles its father the Red and
Yellow, it has however the body colour of the Red and Blue being a
rather dark crimson; it also has the tail colour of the Red and Blue and the
lines of small feathers crossing the bare face patch. The yellow on the
wing coverts is perhaps a little greener than in those carried by most
Red and Yellows. Without the comparison of the parents one would
take the young Macaw for a Red and Yellow apart from the face lines.
The bird is the same size as its parents but of course has the grey eye of
a young bird. The plumage is excellent with no signs of * stress ' in any
of the flight feathers or in the tail.

On the third day out of the nest a sudden fright caused the young
Macaw to use its wings and with surprising ease it flew in wide circles
around the Zoo calling to its parents who screamed in encouragement.
Like most Parrots it did not take kindly to flying down, preferring to
alight on the tops of aviaries and trees.
At one stage when flying some distance from the Zoo the bird was
joined by a flock of Herring Gulls who seemed half inclined to mob it
followed by a most amusing encounter when a passing Raven changed
course to fly alongside the Macaw doubtless wondering what on earth
this bird could be!!
Fortunately the young Macaw was eventually captured and returned
to its parents.

BREEDING GREY WAGTAILS, MOTACILLA
CINEREA, USING FISH AS FOOD
By R. McCluskey (Bedford, England)
This year, 1971, I have bred Grey Wagtails, Motacilla cinerea . with
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.998929153846154" page_id="56367193"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
small fish as the staple diet. They were in a series of interconnecting
aviaries around a bird-room, the aviaries being 6 feet wide and varying
through 11 6 ft. ins., 7 ft. 6 ins., 5 ft., and 3 ft. 3 ins. in length. They
shared these aviaries with a pair each of Pied Wagtails Motacilla alba ,
Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs, Greenfinches Carduelis chloris , Reed
Buntings Emberiza schoeniclus , Blackbirds Turdus merula, and Redwings
Turdus musicus. Instead of shutting the birds in particular aviaries I
gave them the run of all during the winter and allowed them to choose
the one they wished to breed in, on the grounds that I could always shut
them off in it later if necessary.
The aviary which the wagtails chose was the largest. It had in it a
small pond 2 ft. x 1 ft. and 4 ins. deep, which was fed with a constant
drip of fresh water from a series of six galvanised trays situated one to
each aviary, connected up with polythene tubing and gravity fed from one
to the next. It also had at one end of the aviary a small cotswold stone
wall almost hidden by nettles and tall grass in which the wagtails nested.
A hollow log was hung near the top of the aviary in a further corner from
the nettle bed, with an elderberry bush occupying another.
The birds were fed on my own mixture of softfood, together with
maggots, mealworms and a few stick insects. Haith's " Robin Red "
colour food was added to the softfood, and fed to maggots and mealworms.
This preserved the yellow on wagtails but tended to give this an orange
tint. I found in the past that my softbills have lost colour if they are
not given colour food in their diet.
In March I began to experiment by giving the birds small fish taken
from the local river which flows at the foot of my garden. As far as I

know these were mostly minnows, but a few sticklebacks were also
caught and also, I think, the fry of some larger fish. They were all
about minnow size.
The Grey Wagtails were feeding on the fish. Both had black bibs and
I thought I had two males but the one with the less black bib turned out
to be a female. I never knew they were nesting until I saw the female
with a bill full of fish disappear into a clump of nettles. On checking I
found a nest made of grass, rootlets, moss and horsehair, containing four
chicks about three days old and also one clear egg. The nest was situated
in the small stone wall, almost hidden by nettles and tall grass.
The young were close-ringed at approximately eight days old; and left
the nest on 18th June. I never at any time saw the parents feed the
young on anything except minnows, although there was always a supply
of maggots and softfood available. My nightly walks along the river
bank armed with a two foot diameter net and bucket were not enough;
with the Grey Wagtails emptying the large dish of water that I put in,
containing not only minnows but water boatmen, dragonfly nymphs and a
host of other aquatic insects that I couldn't identify. I also had to go
fishing early in the morning before work, then again at lunch time, and
also make two journeys in the evening. During my fishing expeditions
I fell into the river on several occasions, much to the amusement and
disgust of my wife and family, my wife saying that it was about time we
birdie men grew up!
By now all the other birds sharing the aviaries were eating fish also.
The Reed Buntings nesting in the hollow log in the same aviary and
reared two young, while the Greenfinches reared three young in a nest in
the elderberry bush. Apart from occasional bill-snapping between the
Pied and Grey Wagtails there was no trouble between the various species
On the first day of leaving the nest all four young wagtails ran about
the aviary floor. The next day the largest of the youngsters was seen
to fly a distance of three feet onto a branch of the elderberry bush. That
night all the youngsters roosted in the lower branches of the elderberry.
After this they roosted higher up on perches scattered around the aviary.
They were all flying well at about 15 days old.
They continued to flourish and at 17 days old I first noticed one of them
fishing and taking fish out of the bowl. The others were not seen taking
fish for themselves for another week and in the meantime they were all
still being fed, but by the male only. I had hoped that the female might
have gone down to nest again, but she never did. Maybe its just as well,
as I was having my work cut out looking after the one nest as it was. My
next problem was persuading them to eat other food as they would only
eat fresh small fish etc. and my only solution was to catch them up and
put them into a large stock cage. On examining them I found that the
only defect was that one had a back claw missing. I slowly weaned them
over to maggots, mealworms, an occasional moth, and softfood. It was

quite a job as they did not look too happy whenever their allocation of
minnows were gone.
All my birds still get minnows nearly every day, although not as many
as they would like. The species eating minnows in my aviaries are as
follows--Blackbird, Song Thrush, Yellow, Grey and Pied Wagtails,
Greater Spotted Woodpecker, Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Whinchat, Rock
Pipit, Crossbill, Yellowhammer, and Reed Bunting. This year I have
successfully bred four Grey Wagtails, three Greenfinches, two Reed
Buntings but had numerous failures; I have had clear eggs from Blackbirds,
Chaffinches and Greenfinches; while my Pied Wagtails, Yellow Wagtails
and Rock Pipits only played about.

BIRD FARM-1971 BREEDING SEASON AT
LECKFORD

In 1971 at Leckford we had the misfortune to get a family of stoats
into the main waterfowl enclosure. This was particularly serious as the
whole place is enclosed in half-inch wire-netting topped by a rat guard.
The first animal we caught was the old female who might have known
where she got in, but it took us about two months to catch the entire
family--eight in all--in that time they had of course killed a number of
birds, but though we poisoned all the corpses we found we only killed
some rats which were not the culprits; stoats unfortunately prefer their
meat warm.
We had pairs of White-winged Wood Duck and Hartlaub and bred
the latter. Literature on these species generally describe their social
life as similar to the Muscovies.
In our experience the Hartlaub are very definitely monogamous with
a very strong bond between the pair. In behaviour they are similar to
the African Black Duck, Anas sparsa, they like cover, and are very
intolerant of their own species when breeding. The female here would
have killed a second female I tried to introduce if her mate had shown
any hesitation. Here the duck has always nested on the ground,
generally in rank sedge and grass, once in a box on the ground placed up
a little side stream amongst rank plants. The incubation is 30 days.
The White-winged Wood Duck we had only for one season. The
pair were very tame almost feeding from the hand when one filled their
dishes in the morning, and, at the same time, secretive. They spent a
lot of time resting under a low bridge which takes a road over their
enclosure, but were active as soon as evening started. They called a lot
to each other, the female's voice is very similar to the buzzing voice of the
male New Zealand Shelduck and the male's a weak falsetto edition of

hers. They mated regularly and after mating displayed noisily to each
other throwing out their chests rather as do displaying Ruddy-headed
Geese and showing off their pale blue-grey and white shoulders and wing
patches. They shared a pen with a pair of Radjah Shelduck and a trio
of Hottentot which they ignored.
As I was very intrigued to find out how close to the Muscovies they
really are I acquired a female domestic Muscovy, a black bird with a
speckled neck. They utterly ignored her though the poor Muscovy when
laying constantly solicited the male's attention.
There were four boxes in the enclosure, a Mandarin-size box for the
Radjahs, a super-size Mandarin-type box for the White-wings, a large ground
box and a little one for the Hottentots. The Muscovy demonstrated the
fact that the " hole is greater than the part ", and by some extraordinary
feat laid two clutches in the Mandarin box, the Hottentots went up the
ladder to the huge box and nested in one corner inside, the White-wings
took over the big ground box and made a scrape. The drake often went
into the box rather as do the male Mandarin or the Ring Teal when
their mates are house hunting. Actually the males of most waterfowl
help choose the nest site except perhaps for the Muscovies and Comb
Ducks.
We reared about 30 Black Swans from three pairs, our birds always
rear two broods, one in the Spring and one in the Autumn, only about
20 Black-neck as one of the females developed a throat infection in the
Spring and did not breed. We reared six Coscorobas--the most
delightful friendly youngsters and a good number of Ruddyheaded,
Ashy-headed, Abyssinian, Ross, Cackling and Lesser White-fronted
Geese. Red-Breasted were a disaster; 27 eggs from three females with
only two fertile, one egg in each clutch from the same goose, the two
goslings are both males.
We have a trio of African Pochard from which we have reared a few
annually. But in October 1970 they started laying and laid clutch after
clutch right through the winter including 14 at Christmas time. We did
not set any of their eggs until February, finally we let the ducks sit in
July to stop them. We reared over 70, when the ducklings started
feathering their parents turned on them and the ducks started laying
again in September. To stop them we caught them up and put them in
a holding pen with a lot of young birds and at last they have given up.
We reared broods of all the Shelduck, about 60 Ring Teal, 36 Puna and
most other more usual species.
Homosexual behaviour is common in waterfowl, particularly amongst
the brown Shelduck even when the sexes are about equal, young males,
so often seem attracted to each other and get " paired " before the young
females are interested in anyone. If this catches the eye of any field
naturalist in South Africa or Australia, I should be very interested to
know whether it occurs in the wild.

J. DELACOUR--THE 197 1 SEASON AT CLERES
We have never had this happen amongst young European Shelduck,
but in 1969 we kept back five pairs of young New Guinea Radjahs for
future stock, the five males were brothers and the five females sisters so
from our point of view, it did not matter how they paired, or we thought
it did not! As they do not breed until two years old, we left them all,
plus a spare duck together in a large pen, four of the drakes paired
homosexually and when put in their breeding pens simply stood on tip
toe and yelled to their boy-friends in other pens. The net result was
that only one of these young pairs bred. After a bit of moving friends to
opposite ends of our establishment we have now got everyone properly
paired and hope to breed Radjahs in 1972 as freely as we bred African
Pochard in 1971! As a commercially run concern we do try to estimate
the sort of numbers of each species we rear each year; we try, but the
birds have the final say.

It was an unusually dry and sunny summer in North-western France
which was favourable for bird raising. The spring, however, had a
succession of warm and cold spells which caused a lot of clear eggs and
even a few species did not nest at all. As usual, there were some very
good, as well as disappointing results. We had 27 young Emus from
two pairs, but only a few, late-hatched Rheas. Our Cassowaries now
adult, fight savagely and had to be separated. Surprisingly no cranes
laid, nor did our old Screamers, but we now have two newly imported
pairs. Two pairs of Trumpeter Swans, now four and three years old,
have not yet shown any sign of breeding condition. One pair of Black-
necked Swans reared early five and later four young, while two other
pairs produced infertile eggs only.
A pair of Nenes first laid early in March, and two young were reared
under a bantam; the parents later reared four more. There were n
Emperors and a few Giant Canadas, Cackling, Barnacle Blue and Snow,
Chinese, Lesser White-fronted Geese, but no nests of Ross's or Red-
breasted were found. Our Black Brants were unsuccessful. We kept
the last three years offspring, over twenty birds, and they proved much
less colonial in their nesting habits than we expected; they fought bitterly,
three birds being killed, and even the parent pair failed to breed. They
will have to be separated or moved into the larger park. There were also
five Ashy-headed and 10 Cereopsis as well as a number of Paradise and
South African Shelducks and six Moluccan Radjahs. The old female
Australian Radjah, over twenty-five years old, died after laying two
clutches of clear eggs; we now possess only one pair of that subspecies,
probably the last one in captivity.

We had been very successful last year with maned Geese, but in 1971,
only one clutch of five was found and the young reared. There were
many young ducks, the best being Puna, Sharp-winged and Ringed Teal.
Australian White-eyes are very prolific; a number of them are reared on
the lake and remain well full-winged.
Game-bird breeding was made difficult by the rebuilding of a twenty-
compartments pheasantry. A number of Peafowl, including 6 Green,
Peacock-Pheasants, Junglefowl and others could however be raised.
The Brush-Turkeys in the park produced no young, as they usually do.
Various doves, including Wongas and Lemon Doves also bred well, as
well as some Parrakeets. Quakers are now well established free in the
park. A Kookaburra was hand-reared from the egg, and among Passerine
birds, a Black-throated Tanager Rhamphocelus nigrogularis was reared,
on which Dr. P. Ciarpaglini will report in some detail.
The collection of Hornbills, Toucans, Touracos, Humming birds,
Barbets and of delicate perching birds has been maintained at a good level
and losses have been slight both outdoors and indoors and there are more
birds in the park and the various enclosures than ever before. Therefore
we anticipate greater success next season. But always the unforeseen
happens with living creatures and aviculturists must look forward to the
future with a good dose of philosophy.

The old pair of Blue and Yellow macaws again produced two young
ones making fifteen in seven years. For the first time a pair of Red and
Yellows have bred two nice youngsters. The parent cock is an oldish bird
which we received as an adult some seven years ago. He had previously
been kept as a pet. The parent hen is one we imported five years ago
as a young bird.
We now have twenty-five macaws of which twenty are liberty fliers.
Sometimes as many as twelve birds can be seen in the air at once. It is
not, however, always possible to release them all together. Certain pairs
have dominance and will attempt to drive off other pairs which they
don't get on with.
The young unmated birds (mainly home-bred Blue and Yellows) make
the best spectacle as they fly often in flocks of four to six together. Adults
nearly always fly in pairs.

26 D. RISDON--REPORT ON THE TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS AT RODE 1971
They seem to have little true homing instinct. If they stray more than
a mile away they are lost and have to be fetched back. On one occasion
two years ago, five Blue and Yellows disappeared one afternoon. To my
surprise, these included the old breeding pair which had three young in
the nest. They did not return and that night we had to bring the three
babies indoors and keep them warm with a hot water bottle as they had
not started to grow their feathers. All five birds were retrieved next day,
but they had split up and were widely scattered round the district.
This sudden dispersal is hard to explain unless they had been scared
away by the appearance of some bird of prey. They dislike the silhouette
of a heron and, strangely, those of seagulls. Small hawks, like Kestrels
and Sparrow Hawks, don't seem to worry them. They are fairly easy to
recapture as they are trained to fly to the rattle of the food tin and quickly
come down when hungry.
Only once have we actually lost any for good. That was a pair of Red
and Blues which took to feeding off the country. It was a particularly
fruitful Autumn with plenty of beechmast and berries about, and they
refused to come back to their aviary at feeding time. They stayed about
the grounds for several weeks and eventually disappeared. Normally
such conspicuous birds are quickly seen and reported to us.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos bred two nice young ones, as did the Roseates.
The Umbrellas hatched a young one but let it die when quite young.
Derbyans reared two young which is about their usual quota. In some
years they have raised three. This year, for some extraordinary reason,
after they had fledged, the old cock and one of the young ones quite
suddenly bit off their wing and tail feathers, rendering themselves
flightless. The old hen, who can be a bit of a shrew at times, was
suspected of bullying them, so was removed to an adjoining aviary, but
it will take a moult before they can fly again.
All this happened within a day or so. The more I see of parrots the
more I become convinced that featherplucking (or biting) has nothing to
do with diet but is a form of nervous frustration.
We have had a pair of Eclectus for many years. The hen is imprinted
on human beings and will not allow the cock to mate with her.
Consequently, her eggs are always infertile. Every year after his moult
the cock remains in perfect feather for about six months. Then in a matter
of days he strips off all the outer edges of his breast feathers leaving the
grey underflue.
If one stops at their aviary to pass the time of day, the hen invariably
comes up to talk. The cock's fury then knows no bounds. He loses
his temper and lunges at the hen as well as the human visitor. He is
obviously a very frustrated parrot and bites his feathers like a child
biting its nails.
We have a Moluccan Cockatoo which has been with us for nine years.
It is a feather biter rather than plucker and chews off the ends of its

feathers including the primaries and secondaries. What is worse, it
does this to other cockatoos under the pretence of mutual preening until
the other is reduced to the same dilapidated condition. Yet we have five
other Moluccans all in perfect feather receiving exactly the same diet
and treatment.
It has not been a particularly good breeding year for parrakeets. Five
pairs of Ringnecks produced seven young (two pairs didn't breed at all).
Last year the same five pairs produced fifteen young ones. Six pairs of
Rosellas produced only fourteen young between them, (eighteen in 1970).
Three pairs of Stanleys raised four, (in 1970 there were twelve). Crimson-
wings had four clear eggs. Pennant's did nothing.
Our colony of Peach faced Lovebirds have bred better than ever
before, having reared sixteen young to fledging with young still in the
nest at the time of writing (November). The species is generally reckoned
not to be a good colony breeder but this group numbering seventeen
individuals has been built up over the years from six originals without
adding outsiders. Maybe this is the reason why they don't fight.
Waterfowl
The four Red-breasted Geese purchased several years ago have all
turned out males. Females seem to be at a premium.
We kept last year's three young Bar-headed Geese full-winged merely
feather clipping them for their first year. Now they have moulted out
and are flying well. We have tried full-winged Barnacles without success.
Ours is not the best goose country. Too many tall trees, especially
around the ponds, makes it difficult for geese to land--not so, however,
for the perching ducks, especially Mandarins and Carolinas.
We now have a large flock of these mostly full-winged. Carolinas
are much better stayers than Mandarins, which have gradually dwindled
over a period of years and need constantly replenishing with handreared
birds.
Competition between the species may have a bearing on this. We
started with a preponderance of Mandarins but as the Carolinas have
increased in numbers so have the Mandarins decreased. We put up
large numbers of barrels in the trees for them but these are nearly always
occupied by Carolinas. In fact our problem is to distinguish between
their eggs. Mandarin eggs tend to be larger so we only set the larger ones
but it is surprising how many produce Carolina ducklings.
Nevertheless it is a great joy to see and hear them in the spring
perching like pigeons in the trees as they look for nesting sites.
There is a little pond in front of the bungalow where we live and every
evening I " seed " it with wheat to attract the ducks near the house. At
breakfast time it is quite common to count as many as ten or a dozen
Carolinas and Mandarins on the water displaying to one another.
This summer a Carolina duck brought up a brood of eight ducklings

on this little pond. Normally the ducks try to take their broods down to
the big pool but they have to run the gauntlet of storks, pelicans and
wild herons, not to mention magpies and crows, so they seldom survive.
This time, however, the duck had the good sense to bring her family on
to the little pond and we hastily put a low wire fence right round it so
that they were confined to a safe area.

Pheasants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998848135135135" page_id="56367203"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
Twelve nice young Peacock-Pheasants (&amp;lt;bicalcaratum ,) were reared.
We must have bred and sold over sixty of these during the past seven or
eight years, mainly from the original pair. I wonder where they have
all gone because I hardly ever hear of any and do not know of any
breeding reports.
Apart from the Peacock-Pheasants and Himalayan Monals, we don't
go in for rarities here, preferring the commoner species which cannot be
surpassed in beauty. After much trial and error we have found Goldens,
Reeves's and Blue Crossoptilons to be the best stayers at liberty, and
reasonably compatible. All these are gregarious except in the spring
when some do stray. But for the rest of the year they provide a feast of
grace and colour which are a never-ending source of delight.
Just now in the Autumn they look at their best. The Goldens in
particular perform a ritual display in which up to a dozen cocks take
part, running round each other in circles.
When this is performed in the half shade of the woods with sunlight
dappling through the branches the effect of brilliance is quite bewitching.
This display seems to have nothing to do with mating as hens are, more
often than not, absent.
Although so closely related to Amherst's it is curious how the two
species differ in temperament.
The Golden is a sociable bird and, except in the spring when cocks
are establishing territories, they seldom fight seriously. Amhersts on
the contrary are solitary by nature and aggressive at all times. We have
tried keeping the two species at liberty together without success. Each
Amherst cock demands several acres of territory and woe betide trespassers!
We have one beautiful specimen on free range at present. It is
astonishing how he covers the ground giving the impression of being in
two places at once. Many is the time I have been convinced that there
is more than one bird around. The Amherst's display is no social
affair like that of the Golden, but an aggressive warning to keep off.
Considering that Reeves's are about the best fliers among the ornamental
pheasants, they are excellent stayers. They are also not as aggressive
either among themselves or towards other species as is generally stated.
On the contrary they will quite deliberately break up fights among other
pheasants, shouldering their way in between the combatants, for all the
world like policemen stopping a street fight.

This was particularly noticeable when we kept Silver Pheasants which
were always picking quarrels with the peafowl.
We don't keep Silvers any more because they were such murderers
even at liberty. They were very handsome but a party of them would
systematically hunt other pheasants through the woods till they either
drove them away or, if they dared to square up to them, dug a spur into
their heads.
I then thought of trying Swinhoe's in their place. Here again the
difference in character between two closely related species is remarkable.
The Silver is gregarious and moves around in a loose flock. The
Swinhoe's is solitary. The Silver is as tame and confiding as a domestic
chicken. The Swinhoe's remains wild and shy. Unfortunately the
species has the same bloodthirsty habits.
Blue Crossoptilons get a bit barbary in the spring but generally mind
their own business. They are good liberty birds as they hardly ever fly
and seem to prefer the vicinity of houses.
Other Birds
Our little colony of Cape Penguins continues to be self-supporting.
We started with eight birds in April 1962 and now (November 1971)
there are thirteen. During this time four adult birds (presumably of the
original consignment) have died. Since they were adults when imported,
their age was unknown. Nevertheless it is gratifying to be able to report
an overall population increase.
The Sacred Ibis produced three young ones in 1971 making a total of
ten birds bred here during the past few years. In 1970 we handreared
a young one and left him free as an experiment. He has stayed so well
that we released two more of last year's young. Now they make a
thrilling sight gliding above the trees.
The Scarlet Ibis which did so well two years ago have failed to repeat
their success. Eggs were laid in 1970 and some chicks hatched but they
were not reared. This year they laid but did not hatch. The brilliance
of their colouring varies at different times of the year. They are at their
best during the winter and spring. Then as their beaks turn dark and
their breeding " wattles " develop the colouring on the head and neck
fades to pink. At the end of the summer when moulting is imminent,
their plumage fades all over to pink.
The Eagle-Owls did not attempt to breed this year for the first time
since they became adult and started to lay. They have reared chicks in
the past.
We have a Lydth's Jay which must be qualifying for the old-age
pension. He has had a series of illustrious owners before coming here,
including Peter Paris, the late Reg. Partridge and, before that, Sidney
Porter. Two years ago he had a difficult moult. He began to breathe
badly and I thought it was " curtains " but the old bird rallied and seemed

to shake off his complaint. He now looks as fit as a fiddle, and shares
an aviary with a Hyacinthine Jay.
We have had four Occipital Blue Pies for a long time. They have
nested more than once in the past and have even hatched young, yet
surprisingly, in spite of this, have always remained a compatible group.
This year one pair hatched and reared four fine young. All went well
till fledging time approached when the parents set about one of the others.
This was hastily removed. A close watch was kept on the third bird as
we expected this to be attacked but we were not quite certain which was
which of the pair. Then to my amazement I saw all three birds attend
the nest with food one after the other.
The four young duly fledged and grew into fine birds. Then tragedy
struck and two went down with gape worms. The remaining two
started coughing but after prolonged treatment with first nilverm and
then Thiabendazole seem to be improving.
Our pair of African Casqued Hornbills raised our hopes for a time
by plastering up the entrance hole cut in the side of a barrel. As the
summer waned, however, they lost interest. Perhaps we shall have
better luck next year. These Hornbills are extremely hardy. They
scorn their shelter summer and winter and always roost outside.
We have a fairly representative collection of Touracos--White-cheeked,
Pink-crested, Hartlaub's and Purple-crested. The White-cheeked are
the hardiest and seem the most inclined to breed. One pair have nested
regularly for some years. Usually they fail to sit properly but domestic
pigeons will hatch their eggs perfectly. The incubation period is the
same as that of pigeons (18 days) but the problem is how to rear the
young from such an early age. A fact which never seems to be mentioned
in literature on the subject is that the young gape like young blackbirds.
Also their eyes open within twenty-four hours of hatching and they are
quite active in the nest, so obviously pigeons couldn't cope. We have
tried handrearing but so far without success.
Two years ago the old pair of White-cheeked did rear two youngsters
but neither survived to the first moult.
Two single wattled Cassowaries which were purchased two years ago
as half grown youngsters are now nearing maturity. Although they look
different--one being considerably more heavily built than the other, they

they look twice their normal size, inflating their necks to show the red-

this species but lack of room has prevented us from breeding to the next
generation.
Softbills need plenty of space to breed. In a place of this kind which
depends on public support for its maintenance, visitors expect to see
more than one pair of birds in a large aviary which otherwise looks empty.
Consequently, the birds have to share the accommodation with other
species. The resultant competition for nesting sites and live food means
that breeding successes are more by luck than judgement. Nevertheless
it is surprising what can be achieved with careful management.
Of one thing I am certain; admission of the public does not inhibit the
birds from breeding. On the contrary it steadies them down till they
become indifferent to the presence of visitors, always provided of course
that people keep to their side of the wire-netting.

By C. J. O. Harrison, Assistant Editor
The publication of first accounts of breedings, or details of breedings
rarely achieved, has always been an important function of the magazine.
Such accounts should not only announce an achievement, but give full
details of how it was achieved. Contributors usually do their best, but
often omit some of the more obvious information. We have listed below
the information which we would like to find in such contributions, and
hope that by publishing this we will obviate the need to ask for further
detail, and avoid delay in publication. We think contributions should
include
The common and scientific name of the bird, the region where it
normally occurs, and enough information about its appearence to
enable the reader unfamiliar with the bird to visualise what is being
discussed.
Any information on earlier housing, including arrangements for
overwintering.
A description of the enclosure in which the birds are kept, giving
details of size; internal facilities such as perches and plants, shelter,
and temperature control if any; and other birds sharing the same
accommodation.
The food normally given to the birds, and any seasonal variation.
The nest site and nesting behaviour of the birds.
Any information on laying, hatching and fledging, with actual dates
where possible.
Food given to the young, and any special feeding behaviour, while
young are in the nest, and when fledged.

NOTES OF 1971 FROM THE ZOOLOGICAL

A remodelled and refurnished aviary in the Bird House at Regent's
Park has been completed with the addition of artificial earth banks and
a pool. The aviary has been designed primarily for bee-eaters, and the
first tennants, three Carmine Bee-eaters are now in residence.
The most important breeding events of 1971 have been the successful
rearing of five Snowy Owls, another Spectacled Owl (probably only the
third ever recorded in captivity), Black-footed and Humboldt's Penguins,
a Palawan Peacock Pheasant and four Malayan Glossy Starlings. The
number of species breeding in the Snowdon Aviary continues to increase
and this year included the Bristle-crowned Starling of East Africa which
has probably not been bred in captivity before. The pair of White-
cheeked Turacos in the Snowdon Aviary have been remarkably prolific
and have produced four young from three different broods in only n
months. They built their nest some 10 ft. off the ground in a dead tree
densely covered by a creeper. Both parents fed the young, mainly with
regurgitated fruit, dates, raisins, apples, pears, bananas, etc. The first
youngster was still being occasionally fed by the parents three months
after hatching. The last two young, hatched in September, were about
three weeks old when the tree in which their nest had been built fell
during a storm. They were replaced in the nest, and the parents continued
to feed them though by now the nest was close to the ground. It was
decided finally to move, and hand-feed them.
There have been a number of species which have laid eggs but for
various reasons (including regrettably vandalism) have not hatched them.
Disappointments in this respect have included the Green-winged Macaw,
Sarus Crane, Alpine Chough, Roulroul Partridge and Kookaburra.
Fortunately, when collectable the eggs have not been wasted and have
been used by Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Vevers for their research on shell
pigments.
One of the saddest losses in 1971 has been the death of our male Ostrich
at the age of seven years. It was particularly sad, not only because he
was a great character and had survived a long illness in the previous year,
but also because his new young wife had produced her first eggs. Surpris-
ingly the first egg was laid when she was only 18 months old, and perhaps

not surprisingly they were infertile. Now having established her sex
we hope to obtain another male for her. A death which was especially
sad was the Steller's Sea Eagle. She died of old age having been in the
collection since 1937. She was received in exchange from Moscow and
was thought to be about two years old when she arrived in London,
making her 36 years old when she died.
Species or sub-species new to the collection have included two Curly-
crested Helmet Shrikes, three Abyssinian Ground Thrushes, two White-
bellied Blue Flycatchers, a Little Green Bee-eater, two Yellow-green
Grosbeaks, a Yellow-streaked Lory, a Dusky Lory and the Congo Peafowl.
This latter species and a pair of Imperial Pheasants were deposited with
the Society by Antwerp Zoo, and we were particularly pleased and
honoured to receive both these rare species. The Congo Peafowl was not
discovered until 1936 and still little is known of its biology in the wild.
The Imperial Pheasant from Central Vietnam is possibly even rarer and
is likely to be on the verge of extinction. Those few in captivity all
originate from one pair collected and described for the first time by
Jean Delacour in 1924.
A small group of ostriches was purchased at the beginning of the year
and later transferred to Whipsnade where they will join the White Rhino
herd. Also transferred to Whipsnade were five African hand-reared
vultures of three species. They now inhabit a large new aviary with

separated in their distribution from the Jendaya Conure by the width
of the Amazon river estuary and by the tropical rain forest which lines
the river's mouth and banks, for they are birds of the Savanna Country.
All accounts of these extremely handsome birds suggest that no two are
coloured exactly alike. They resemble the Jendaya Conure but the
wings and back, which are green in the Jendaya, are bright yellow with
the flight feathers blue. The gold of the body feathers is also overlaid
with a flowing suffusion of an exquisite tangerine-red shade. My birds
are confiding but not hand tame. They agree well with a pair of
Jendayas with which they are housed. All four sleep in the same box at
night but remain in their subspecific pairings throughout the day. Their
voices can be distinguished by different themes on the same basic
unpleasantness "

2 Blue and Yellow Macaws, 2 Red and Yellow Macaws and 2 Derbyan
Parrakeets. The Scarlet Ibis laid but failed to hatch this year. A wild
heronry seems to be establishing itself in the trees surrounding the lake.
Over the years young herons which have fallen from their nests prema-
turely and have been unable to fly have been brought to us. After
teaching them to feed themselves it has been our practice to turn them
loose down by the lake. By this time they have learnt where a living is
easy and seldom go far. Moreover, they have obviously told their wild
friends who now come in to share the pickings. This year we are pretty
sure there was a nest in the top of one of the tall conifers bordering
the lake. Now it is quite a common sight to see as many as six to
eight herons sitting around at penguin feeding time, waiting for the
sprats left over by the penguins. They also consume quantities of dead
day-old chicks put out to feed the Storks and Secretary Birds. On a
recent rough census we counted fifty Mandarin and Carolina Ducks on
the lawn, most of which are full-winged. Carolinas predominate ".

breeding season, the results reflecting the perfect conditions under which
his stock is kept. His birds produced 30 Splendid, 5 Turquoisine,
5 Elegant, 7 Bourke, 3 Bluewinged, 10 Redrumped, 5 Manycoloured,
7 Rosella and 3 Pennant's Parrakeets, 13 Cockatiels and 2 Abyssinian
Lovebirds. P. Paris also did well and bred 6 King, 22 Splendid and
9 normal/yellow Turquoisine Parrakeets as well as several Princess of
Wales, Bluewings and Bourkes. Also bred in his aviaries were several
serins of different species including 4 White-bellied and 7 Black-throated
Canaries and 4 of the East African race Reichenowi. Seven Nyassa
Crimson-winged Waxbills complete a very impressive list.

Writing on the lifting of the ban on the importation of parrots our
President stated in the Avicultural Magazine, January-February 1967,
" It is up to importer and exporter alike to do everything possible to ensure
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.993590608695652" page_id="56367210"  page_num="35" year="" vol="">
that birds are packed and transported under the best possible conditions.
For remember, should this ban ever be reimposed it is very unlikely that it
would be on public health grounds, but almost certainly on humanitarian. "
Now, four years later, parrots and other birds are being imported in such
appalling conditions that it would not be surprising if an import ban were
imposed on animal health, human health or humanitarian grounds.
Most of us have a strange ambivalent attitude towards animal dealers
and we do nothing to try and improve the conditions in the frankly
disgusting trade in livestock. Veterinarian G. A. Smith writes, " I
wonder just what proportion of freshly imported birds die before a
month of their imprisoned existence is out? Annually I make a resolution
never to buy a bird through a dealer and I wish I could keep this pledge.
But I haven't the strength of will to resist buying a specially enticing
bird. During the past three years I have bought seven parrots from
dealers. They were sent by rail, four were ill on arrival and died within
a few days, two lived for a fortnight and one Red-capped Parrot for ten
weeks despite the fact that its air sacs were practically solid with
aspergillosis. At the time of writing (November 1971) so many parrots
from Singapore and South America are arriving with Newcastle disease,
which kills the birds almost invariably, that I would strongly advise
anyone thinking of buying a parrot from a dealer to avoid doing so unless
certificates of vaccination against this disease are forthcoming.

GRUNDRISS DER VOGELZUGSKUNDE. By E. Schuz et al.

Berlin and Hamburg: Paul Parey 1971. 88 DM.
The title of this book, unless I and my German dictionary err, could
be translated as " An outline of bird migration a very modest title for
a masterly and absorbing book. Professor Schuz and his collaborators,
Dr. Peter Berthold, Dr. Eberhard Gwinner and Dr. Hans Oelke have not
only given a comprehensive outline of the subject but have filled in most
of the salient features with a wealth of interesting and (equally important)
interestingly presented detail.
The headings of the main sections of the book are (my translation or
attempts thereat ): (A) Bird migration--a form of animal travel; (B)
Basic ideas and methods of migration study: (C) Pictures of migration
from different areas; (D) The migrations of some individual species;
(E) Some aspects of the migration scene; (F) The migrations of some
non-European birds; (G) Eruptive migrants; (H) The influence of
weather; (J) The physiology of bird migration; (K) Orientation; (L)
The origins and significance of bird migration: and (M) Citation of
references.
I must own that migration is not a subject I have studied intensively.
It is possible therefore that there may be a few " slips " as can usually be
found even in the best of books by reviewers of sufficient knowledge and
pernicketiness, but I doubt if there can be many such. The book is
written throughout in a clear, readable and interesting manner. It is
profusely illustrated with 142 pictures ranging from maps showing the
migration routes and distributions of individual species (of which there
are a great many) to copies of Ancient Egyptian portraits of bird-catching
and crane-keeping. I found the sections on individual species of parti-
cular interest but I think few bird addicts will be able to read any chapter
without stumbling on some intriguing or thought-provoking fact which
they had either not known or had half-forgotten.
Exclusive of the index the book contains 375 pages. I heartily recom-
mend it to all who are interested in birds and who can read German,
whether they are especially interested in migration or not. I hope that it
will soon be translated into English.

CEBU OR GOLDEN-BACKED HANGING PARROT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987573285714286" page_id="56367212"  page_num="37" year="" vol="">
In " Extinct, Vanishing and Hypothetical Parrots " (1970, 198-204) I said that
the Cebu or Golden-backed Hanging Parrot Loriculus philippensis chrysonotus was
gradually exterminated by the destruction of forests on Cebu, about 1906. In
this I erred, but I erred in good company for I merely repeated the believed status
as given in the Red Data Book, vol. 2.
T. R. M. Brosset writes from Gothenburg drawing my attention to an article by
A. L. Rand, "Late Records of the Cebu Golden-backed Hanging Parrakeet "
(Avicultural Magazine, 1959, 177-178). Walter Goodfellow returned from
the East early in 1929: amongst the birds collected were twelve Golden-backed
Hanging Parrots. From this it may be inferred that this subspecies existed in some
numbers on Cebu until 1929, at least. One presented to the London Zoo in 1936
was still living at the end of 1943 (1943, 161).
Thomas Brosset has kindly sent me a photostat copy of part of Rand and Rabor,
" Birds of the Philippine Islands " {Fieldiana: Zoology, vol. 35, no. 7) (i960). In
the section dealing with the birds of Siquijor Island it is suggested it may be that
the race siquijorensis became extinct with the dwindling of the forest. As there
are no less than eleven recognized races it can be appreciated that it is a little
difficult to decide which have become extinct, especially as the Filipinos often
cage specimens, especially the Central Island L. p. regains , and carry them from
island to island.

BILL COLOUR IN GO-AWAY BIRDS; AND A ROOSTING
ASSOCIATION OF NEGRO FINCH AND PIGEON

Here in Kenya I am staying with Tim and Jane Barnley, who have several
aviaries on their farm. Recently two things have come to my notice wdiich I
think of special interest.
Firstly, in their description of the White-bellied Go-away Birds, Corythaixiodes
leucogaster, in Volume 1 of "Birds of Eastern and North-eastern Africa",
Mackworth-Praed and Grant state that the sexes are alike. Other books I have
consulted mention no sex difference. However, on the slender evidence of two
pairs caught not too far from here, I think there may be a difference. In both
instances one bird of the pair possessed a dark, virtually black bill and the other a
greenish-yellow bill. Mackworth-Praed and Grant say that the bill is black, but
in the same volume Roland Green's plate shows it yellow. I would be interested
if anyone has the opportunity to check, to know if this is a sex difference. I hope
to make further observations myself.
Secondly, Jane Barnley brought to my notice the fact that a solitary Grey-
crowned Negro Finch, Nigrita canicapilla, in one of the aviaries roosts on the back
of one of two Green Pigeons, Tver on australis. The other birds in the aviary
are a Golden-Rumped Tinker-Bird, Pogoniulus bilineatus , and a Blue-naped
Mousebird, Colins macrourus. This Negro Finch is a member of the waxbill
family, about 5 in. long, grey and white above and black below and on the face.
It feeds principally on fruit and insects.
More recently a second Negro Finch has joined the other after a settling period
of a few days in a cage, and I was most interested to know how it would roost,
and managed to make observations on half-a-dozen occasions. I could not do so
on its first night in the aviary, when I think it roosted alone on a branch, while the
other roosted on the back of one of the pigeons, but during the following six days
I was able to check on all but one night.
On the first of these occasions the pigeons roosted side by side, so that they were
touching; and one Negro Finch slept sitting on the perch between then, while the
other roosted on the back of the right-hand pigeon. On the four remaining
nights on which I made observations the pigeons slept a little apart from each
other; and on three occasions one Negro Finch roosted on the back of each pigeon,

but once both roosted on the back of the right-hand pigeon, this being the one
that the single Negro Finch had usually used. Since making observations on
roosting birds is difficult, and may frighten them, I have made no further checks.

Aviculturists have always found it difficult to provide a suitable material in
which species that excavate their own nest holes can burrow. In the May and
October numbers of the British Trust for Ornithology News, Colin Brown has
described how he induced wild Willow Tits to breed by providing a nestbox
filled with expanded polystyrene, and subsequently had Lesser Spotted Wood-
peckers breeding in a similar suitably-placed nestbox. These were typical
nestboxes, in the latter instance covered with bark, and each was filled with a
block of polystyrene into which the birds excavated their normal nest-cavity. It
occurred to me that this information might be of help and interest to aviculturists
faced with similar problems in providing nest-sites.

The Council is pleased to announce that the formation of a joint Avicultural
and Ornithological Reference Library has been made possible by an agreement
with the Linnean Society. The arrangements are as follows:
The journals which the Avicultural Society receives from all over the world in
exchange for the Avicultural Magazine, together with any books which it may
own now or in the future, will be housed in the Linnean Society Library, at
Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W.i. All these works will bear our stamp
and be catalogued as our property so that they may be recovered at any time. The
Linnean Society will gather together all its own works on aviculture and ornithology
(some 500 volumes) and place them with ours to make one joint collection, a
complete list of which may be obtained on request from this office.
The Avicultural Society will pay the Linnean Society a fee&amp;apos;of #40 per annum,
for an initial trial period of one year and thereafter to be reviewed regularly;
in return, the Linnean Society will house and administer our library and allow
our members to use the whole of the Linnean Society Library. The facilities
offered will be for reference only, as it is too costly and difficult to run a loan
scheme. If the demand made on their library staff by our members is greater
than expected, they may seek new terms, if the demand is very slight then we may.
Avicultural Society Members' admission to the Linnean Society Library will
be strictly by Reader's Ticket only, to be issued by this office at a charge of #1
per year (to be reviewed after the trial period). Foreign Members visiting this
country for a shorter period than three months will be issued with a temporary
Reader's Ticket free of charge.

Burlington House is on the north side of Piccadilly, halfway between Green
Park and Piccadilly underground stations. As one enters Burlington House, the
Linnean Society is on the left, under the arch.
The Linnean Society's Library is acknowledged to be one of the finest in the
world and Council hopes that Avicultural Society members will welcome having
access to it. It owns many old and rare books on botany as well as the branches of
pure and applied zoology, and receives some 900 journals covering the whole
field of biology including many of particular interest to aviculturists. The
Linnean Society is keen to build up a really comprehensive set of general reference
books for indentification purposes as well as field guides, checklists, etc., and it
is hoped that between us, our two Societies can make this a unique collection of
avicultural and ornithological works. If any Members have suitable books
which they could donate to the Avicultural Society, these will be most gratefully
accepted for our new Library and the gift duly recorded.
Members' suggestions and enquiries regarding this scheme, as well as applica-
tions for Readers' Tickets, should be made to me. We hope that there will be
many applicants for tickets--one or two visits to this unique library and building
would more than justify the expenditure. Hon. Secretary.

The Council would like to record its gratitude to Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith
and Mr. Terry Jones for very generously donating to the Society a collection of
Avicultural Magazines which between them cover the years 1937 to the present.
It is intended to use these to form the basis of an official set of Avicultural
Magazines which the Society does not at present possess. As complete volumes
are collected, they will be bound and placed with the rest of the Society's books
and journals in the Linnean Society Library where they will be available for
reference by Members as well as officials of the Society.
If any member can donate earlier issues of the Magazine for this purpose, these
will be most gratefully accepted. Hon. Secretary.
The Editor does not accept responsibility for opinions expressed in articles,

BREEDING THE LESSER PATAGONIAN
CONURE AT CHESTER ZOO

<bodyText confidence="0.99297324137931" page_id="56367222"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(Cyanoliseus patagonus patagonus)
By William H. Timmis (Curator of Birds and Mammals)
Conures have always been particular favourites of mine. They consist
of seven genera: Aratinga, Nandayus, Leptosittaca, Pyrrhura, Cyanoliseus,
Conuropsis and one aberrant American genus, Rhynchopsitta, and include
89 species and subspecies. Their name is derived from the cuneate or
wedged-shaped form of the tail--each feather decreasing in width
symmetrically toward the end and terminating in a rounded point.
The Lesser Patagonian Conure, [Cyanoliseus patagonus) (Vieillot, 1817)
breeds in the south-central part of Argentina from southern Nanquen
Territory and southern Buenos Aires province to Chubut, migrating in
winter north to Mendoza and Buenos Aires, occasionally to Uruguay and
apparently in the mountains of Cordoba. It is some two inches smaller
than the Greater Patagonian Conure, ( Cyanolisues patagonus byroni)
(J. E. Gray, 1831) which formerly inhabited central Chile from Aconcagua
to Valdivia and is now confined to a few localites in the mountains of the
central provinces.
The basic colouring of Cyanoliseus patagonus is olive-green with a
blackish cast, darker on the upper parts, almost black on the forehead
and crown, and paler on the underparts. There is a very narrow white
band across the upper chest which ends in white spots on the shoulders.
The abdomen is yellowish with red flecks, with a reddish area in the
centre; lower ends of the thighs are red. There is a very prominent
white ring around the eye; the bill is black.
During the spring of 1967 a pair of Lesser Patagonian Conures were
purchased from a local dealer and after a period of acclimatisation they
were transferred to an outside aviary measuring 15 ft. x 17 ft.6 ins. x 7 ft.
This aviary has a layer of washed river sand some 18 ins. deep on the
floor. No signs of breeding were observed until late April 1970.

W. H. TIMMIS-BREEDING THE LESSER PATAGONIAN CONURE
despite the fact that several suitable nest-boxes plus a hollow tree
trunk were offered. The first nesting activity was in the form of
excavating a number of holes in the hard-packed sand of the aviary floor,
some of these being only several inches deep while others were up to
three feet in length; one of these widened into a dome-shaped nesting
cave about 29 cms. in diameter and appeared to be lined with small
feathers; the conures had moulted out only a few weeks before this hole
was examined. Digging was achieved by loosening the hard-packed
sand with the beak and passing the material under the belly to the feet
which in turn then kicked the sand backwards a distance of some four or
five feet. On several occasions both birds would be out of sight down the
longest hole, sending out great sprays of dampish sand through the
entrance hole.
This activity continued until late June and upon examining the longest
of the tunnels I found one dull white egg. This was of a rough and
chalky texture, rounded in shape and measured 28-3 mm. x 22-9 mm.
No attempt was made by the conures to incubate that year.
On the 28th April 1971 I decided to move the pair of Lessers to a new
range of breeding aviaries which had solid concrete floors onto which we
had spread a layer of washed river sand to a depth of some three or four
inches. The aviary measures 23 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft. 6 ins. Several nest-
boxes were offered but the pair showed no interest at all until the
14th May when a box 16 ins. square, 3 ft. 6 ins. tall, placed on a wooden
frame which brought the entrance hole 5 ft. 6 ins. above the ground, was
placed in the flight. First interest was confined to chewing the outside
of the box, followed by both birds sleeping inside all night. On the
afternoon of 24th May 1971 the female went into the nest-box on her own
and was not seen again until the 30th May when the male was observed
feeding her at the entrance hole. I found that the male could be
distinguished from the female by his slightly larger head and beak and
also the reddish area on the abdomen appeared to be deeper in colour.

On the 18th June I heard very faint squeakings coming from the
nest-box. Up to this time the male was never observed entering the box,
but soon after hearing the young calling he was seen regularly entering
and leaving in order to help with the feeding of the young. From my
observations I worked out the incubation period at around 25 days. The
nest-box was not inspected until the 22nd July and was found to contain
four young conures in subsequent stages of development, confirming
that the Lesser Patagonian starts incubation immediately after the first
egg has been laid and this usually results in a family of young of various
ages and sizes. On the 17th August one young bird was seen perching
at the entrance hole of the nest-box, being fed by both male and female,
and by the 20th a second chick was at the entrance hole. These two
left the nest completely on the 31st August and a third specimen on the
12th September 1971. The fourth chick must have died early in
development.
The three young were almost identical in colour to the adults, with the
exception of the upper mandible which was bone-white in colour. All
our conures are fed on a mixture of sunflower seed, two parts of canary
seed to one part each of millet, oat groats, a little hemp and peanuts with
plenty of fruit daily, in particular apples cut into quarters. Supplements
of bread soaked in nectar mixture, lettuce, sprouted grains and celery tops
are fed in small amounts. Cuttlefish bone is available at all times as a
source of minerals. When rearing young conures I find spinach-beet,
Shepherd's Purse {Capsella bursa pastoris), Watercress {Nasturtium
officinale), Dandelion {Taraxacum vulgare) and Chickweed {Stellaria
media) are all invaluable in the breeding season.
Regarding giving nectar to conures, during the spring of 1966 I watched
Aratinga pertinax on Curacao and Bonaire eating the flowers of
Gliricidia sepium , which according to the local people are known for
their richness of nectar.
The Lesser Patagonian Conure is one of the many species of birds
which I feel must be bred by Zoological Gardens and aviculturists as
like so many other species it is gradually becoming much scarcer in the
wild. Willaim G. Conway, 1965, states that years ago the Lesser
Patagonian wintered as far north as Buenos Aires and could be found in
immense flocks. Today it is much more rare; the furthest north that he
saw them was only 75 miles north of Bahia Blanca. There are still large
numbers in a few places but due to their fondness for the farmers' crops
they are shot in considerable numbers. Shooting, states Conway, is
very easy for it is said that the flocks show great distress when a member is
killed and circle over fallen companions, thus offering the hunter the
opportunity of repeated shots.
It would be a great tragedy if this spectacular bird was to follow the
fate of the Carolina Conure, {Conuropsis carolinensis).

(Poicephalus senegalus senegalus )
By Robert Nelson (Coquille, Oregon, U.S.A.)
My first pair of Senegals, newly imported, were acquired in March 1970.
They were in perfect feather and health, and seemed obviously a true
pair with drastic differences in general stature and cranial structure.
The male being over-all just more dominant and masculine in appearance.
The female being quite delicate and refined by comparison.
Due to cold weather at the time, they were placed in a cage measuring
18 in. x 24 in. x 48 in. in a corner of one of my basement birdrooms,
and due to lack of space in the outdoor flights later on, here they have
remained. It seems that my collection continues to grow more rapidly
than outside pens can be constructed, and the larger birds always get
first chance at the more roomy flights.
Although always shy, the little Senegals seemed quite content in their
new environment, and I observed mutual preening many times. In
April 1971, I observed courtship advances and feeding of the hen by her
devoted mate. With these observations in mind, I decided to provide a
nest, although I really must admit I did not actually expect results from
such shy birds in such close confinement! I provided a cockatiel nest
10 in. x 10 in. x 14 in. which I hung at an angle, so if disturbed they
would not pounce on the nest contents in their haste. Within minutes
the hen was in the nest exploring, and in less than an hour was busy
redecorating and remodelling! Throwing out the bits of sawdust and
rotten wood I had included as nesting material and that which was
allowed to remain was eventually pulverised almost to dust. The male
also entered after a while, and they kept quite busy for several days. Of
course my optimistic nature came to the fore with all the activity, and I
expected eggs soon to follow. Such was not the case! Although they

did not sleep in the box, many hours each day were spent inside. After
weeks passed and no eggs appeared, my optimism waned and I did not
even bother to peek for weeks at a time. Then, one day in August,
around the 20th if my memory serves me correctly, I happened to look
into the nest, and could see two eggs. I did not peek into the nest again,
but on 4th September an eggshell was thrown from the nest, and I could
hear the cry of a new arrival within. I managed to contain my curiosity
until 14th September when I could see two small grey balls of down
alongside the parent bird in the nest. On 25th September I went into
the nest to remove the babies for handfeeding, and was delighted to find
three fat youngsters!
They responded well, indeed, to a diet of cooked wheathearts with a
little sunflower meal added. All three babies grew into fine strong birds,
actually a bit larger than their wild-caught parents. They started
nibbling at seeds when twelve weeks old, but I did not consider them
independent until they were a full sixteen weeks old. They are now
adorable, gentle little birds and simply beg for attention. A very
delightful change from their very shy parents, to be sure. It may be a
lot of trouble to hand-feed baby parrots, but I feel that the end result of
such very tame and trusting birds is worth the extra effort, and besides
if you really love birds it is such fun !
While the parent birds were feeding their babies, they ate heavily
of safflower seed and sweet corn (on the cob) with, of course, the usual
sunflower and a few oats and millets. My Senegals seem not to like
canary seed, nor would they consume soaked sunflower and fruit which so
many parrots seem to love when assuming the task of feeding a nestfull
of hungry kids. The hen rarely left the nest, the male seemingly doing
most of the feeding.
I would like to know of others who have raised these lovely little
parrots in their aviaries. At the moment I am aware of only two other
producing pairs in the U.S.A. I would be pleased to correspond with
anyone regarding breeding of these birds, and would endeavor to answer
any and all questions. I have acquired several other imported Senegals,
and plan to keep all that I can raise for a while, in hopes of eventually
building up an aviary-bred strain of these beautiful and charming little
African parrots.

(Cygnus columbianus bewickii )
By John Secrett (Wildfowl Trust, Glos., England)
Bewick's Swans are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity. The
only previous success recorded has been by the Wildfowl Trust at Slim-
bridge (Johnstone 1957), whose female nested from 1956 up to the time
that her second mate died in 1969.
In early May 1970 a pair of Bewick's, both descendents of the Slimbridge
birds, nested for the first time at the Bentley Wildfowl Collection. This
fine collection, situated close to Lewes in Sussex, was started in 1962 by
the late Gerald Askew and is now maintained by Mrs. G. Askew. On
this occasion, three eggs were laid but, regrettably, were lost to crows.
On 4th May 1971 the Bentley Bewick's once again set about nesting.
The female showed much interest in a large pile of twigs and rushes
which had been provided some ten yards from the pond, and on 6th May
the first egg was laid. Its measurements of 67 mm. x 109 mm. were
similar to those of five eggs laid at Slimbridge by the bird's mother
(70.5 mm. x 106 mm.). Another four eggs followed on alternate days
and on 17th May the female began her 30-day incubation. A point of
interest was that only four yards away, in the adjacent pen, a pair of
Trumpeter Swans were also nesting, yet no aggression was ever seen
between these four birds.
The female Bewick's sat very tightly and was seldom off the clutch.
Everything progressed well to start with but, as incubation was entering
its final stages, the weather, which had not been good anyway, deteriorated
quite alarmingly. For days there was torrential rain and many nests
throughout the grounds were deserted because of waterlogging. As well
as this, young goslings already out on the grass were getting chilled and
then contracting pneumonia. With just four days to go before hatching
there was serious flooding--water had already reached the Trumpeters'
nest--and there was little alternative but to bring the Bewick's eggs in
to safety. At this stage they were candled, and it was clear that only
one was going to hatch. Of the other four, three were addled and one
was infertile. Fortunately the rain eased off a little and the floods
subsided enough to make it possible to return the eggs to the female who
in the meantime had been sitting on dummies. There weie just two
days left before hatching.
On 16th June a small downy white cygnet could be seen peering out
from under the wing of a very proud mother. The male Bewick's was
also obviously excited about the new arrival and spent much of his time
beside the nest. Then, just as everything seemed to be going well, the
weather took another turn for the worse. The female stayed on her
nest for two days sheltering her young from the deluges of rain. Food

and water dishes were placed on the rim of the nest and from these the
cygnet fed readily. On the third day after hatching, it was bright and
sunny and for the first time the cygnet was led to the water by the mother
bird. There was little problem in feeding the young one. It grazed
enthusiastically and adapted well to chick starter crumbs. An assortment
of pond and water weeds, such as duckweed, watercress and floatgrass,
was provided in the early stages. At seven weeks the cygnet was
beginning to feather over the scapulars and by 13 weeks the last traces of
down had gone. This bird was moved from Bentley to the Wildfowl
Trust in October 1971 where it can now be seen in the Rushy Pen
together with other collection Bewick's and many wild ones also. On
release (at four months old) it weighed 10 lb. 8 oz. and was sexed as a
female. It is hoped that in a few years she will help to make up another,
much needed, breeding pair at Slimbridge.
Also reared at Bentley in the 1971 season were another 43 species of
ducks, geese and swans. In addition, 16 species produced clear eggs. It
is hard to guess the cause of this disturbingly high infertility; it may be
due to several factors such as incorrect pairings, interference by surplus
males, old age, etc. Perhaps the most exciting young reared were seven

Black Brent, these being the first ever at Bentley. In all, four females
laid at roughly weekly intervals, 14th May, 22nd May, 30th May and
5th June. An unusual feature was that the last two females were paired

to the same male. He defended both nests, which were only 20 yards
apart, and both females were fertilised. Although polygamy is not
particularly unusual in temperate-region geese (Ne-ne, Swan Geese,
large Canadas, and Greylags), this is the first time I have noticed it in
an arctic goose species. Two pairs of Cereopsis geese reared eight
goslings between them (five and three). These birds always do well at
Bentley; the abundance of good grass throughout the year must be one
reason for their success. With a further two pairs of Cereopsis approach-
ing breeding age, it looks as though many more ought to be reared in
subsequent years, an encouraging thought considering that this species
has a world population of under 6000. Six young Ne-ne (an even
rarer goose, now numbering about 1,000) were produced from two adult
pairs. Only one other Ne-ne has been previously reared at Bentley, in
1970. The Emperor Geese were also reasonably successful. Four
females laid, two on 9th May, one on 10th May and one on 13th May.
Their eggs, except for one clear clutch, had an excellent fertility record.
Sixteen young hatched from 18 eggs and of these, 13 were finally raised.
Other interesting young reared included Whooper Swans, Black Swans,

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
It has long been my contention that the various birds considered as
members of the Sugar-bird family ( Coerebidae ) with the exception of those
of the genus Coereba , really are Tanagers ( Thraupidae ). They have the
same general habits and behaviour, and their colours and plumage
patterns are similar. Some species of Dacnis and Iridophanes , long
considered as Sugar-birds, actually differ from Tanagers of the genera
Pseudodacnis, Chlorochrysa and even Tangora only very slightly in their
more or less longer, thinner and more curved bills, while their plumage is
practically identical. My belief in their very close relationship as members
of the same family ( Thraupidae ) has just been highly supported by the
recent production of hybrids between two species of Sugar-bird and
Tanagers, differing more from each other than a number of others, which
are intermediate.
During 1971, several broods have been reared at the San Diego Zoo
from a pair consisting of a male Yellow-winged Sugar-bird ( Cyanerpes
cyaneus) and a female Mrs. Wilson's Tanager ( Tangara nigrocincta
fanny), two species of fairly different shape, plumage and size. The
sexes, in the Sugar-birds, are very different, the male brilliantly royal blue
and black, with an opalescent crown and yellow patches in the wing; the
female dull olive and grey. Both sexes are alike in Mrs. Wilson's Tanager,
mostly light blue and black, with a white belly. Yellow-winged Sugar-
birds have the longest bills in their group, while in Mrs. Wilson's Tanagers
it is short and rather thick.
The hybrids are intermediate and generally resemble Sugar-birds of the
genus Dacnis. The males are a light blue with a white belly; the females
resemble them but show much grey on the head and neck.
It is interesting to note that there are many other Sugar-birds and
Tanagers in the large planted aviary, through which visitors walk con-
tinually in the day. It is therefore not because of a lack of more appropriate
mates that those birds have paired up and bred together. Mr. K. C. Lint,
the Curator of Birds at the San Diego Zoo, will soon publish details and
coloured photographs of these very significant hybrids. It would be of
great value to have the proof of their possible fertility.

THE SPACE REQUIREMENTS OF SMALL BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997286380952381" page_id="56367232"  page_num="49" year="" vol="">
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
To summarise the information for those who do not wish to read it in
full:- To avoid overcrowding or unduly confining birds some rules are
needed for calculating a minimal space allowed for each pair. An
examination of the space allowed by various persons successfully
keeping birds, suggests that for birds of finch size, in an indoor situation
where space is very limited, 50+ or preferably 704- cubic feet per pair
should be allowed; and in outdoor aviaries 100+ to 350 cubic feet per
pair, or more, should be allowed. The greatest dimension should be
the length.
I appreciate that discussion of this subject in this journal involves,
in the majority of cases, preaching to the converted; but I think that we
should take a lead in putting forward, and discussing, such ideas.
One of the failings of which bird-keepers tend to be guilty is that of
ever-crowding birds, or of offering too little space in individual enclosures.
There are several reasons for this. Newcomers to birdkeeping are
offered the commercially available all-wire cages which are far too small,
or breeding cages designed for canaries and budgerigars which can
adapt themselves to extremely limited accommodation which most other
species will not tolerate. They may also see birds at shows in tiny show
cages and although they may know they cannot keep birds in these they
tend to assume that the birds will not need much more space at other times.
More experienced bird keepers who have kept only canaries and budgeri-
gars and who come to keep other native species or foreign birds, appear
at times unable to grasp that the requirements of these might be different.
Presumably in time it might be possible with some species to produce
tolerant strains like those of the domestic canary; but I doubt if our more
civilised age should tolerate the savage indifference to well-being that
this entails, and most people would prefer to try to give a bird the
conditions that it needs for its comfort.
It is difficult to discuss this subject because there are so few standards
available by which to measure space requirements. With most bird
species the problems are similar to those encountered when keeping fish,
in that three dimensions of accommodation are involved. The fish-keepers
overcome their problem by adopting a rough rule-of-thumb which allows
so much cubic space per inch of fish. I think we could try a similar
system for birds, although it would be easier to use a few size categories
rather than precise units of length.
Now I am well aware that a number of other factors may be involved
in successfully accommodating small birds, varying with the species
concerned. I am also aware that although a size in cubic feet can be
given, space may be more desirable in one direction than in the other.

50 C. J. 0 . HARRISON--THE SPACE REQUIREMENTS OF SMALL BIRDS
The greatest length is an important factor and a narrow, horizontal aviary
would be more desirable than a narrow vertical one. In spite of such con-
siderations I am convinced that we need some general figures to start with.
Having calculated my own space allowances for various birds I made a
random check through publications such as the Avicultural Magazine
and Cage and Aviary Birds, noting such measurements; and more
recently, at an A.S.P.E.B.A. A.G.M. I asked the members present to
note down the space they allowed per pair of birds. The data that I
have are mainly for finch-sized birds, both seed-eating and insectivorous,
and for a few thrushes and small doves. The people questioned were
concerned with keeping birds under conditions which would encourage
them to breed.
It was interesting to discover that there was a general measure of
agreement. From the data the figures that I have given above emerged.
Most people keeping birds inside birdrooms, where space was limited,
would allow for finch-sized birds at least 50+ cubic feet per pair, and
usually 70 +, although one had some success with 40 cubic feet, and the
inevitable exception occurred. In that case Redstarts had bred in a cage
8 ft. x 1 ft. 4 in. x 1 ft. 4 in. The cage length may have been relevant.
I think such exceptions will continue, but I greatly doubt that they will
lead to consistent and long-term success in either keeping or breeding
of birds. For outside aviaries there was one at 96 cubic feet per pair,
the others ranging evenly between 100 and 360 cubic feet. I think one
could take these figures and make reasonable proportional allowances for
larger species. I do not suggest that the measurements given above
represent the ideal situation. It is possible that they are minimal sizes.
To most aviculturists the suggested space allowances quoted above are
probably not novel, but it is of interest to compare these figures with
those for the structures in which many birds are kept. Most commercial
bird cages have a capacity of 2-3 cubic feet; and rarely may rise to 4-6
cubic feet. The various " breeding cages " offered also fall within this
range, and none begin to approach the suggested dimensions. I think
that these small structures have done much to discredit bird-keeping in
the eyes of outsiders. The birds they see; the birds in the shops, and
at the shows, and the wretched family Budgerigar, are in quarters so
confined that anyone who has seen a bird in its natural state, even if it is
only a sparrow or a starling, is likely to feel some uneasiness.
I think it is up to us, as aviculturists, not merely to take a holier-than-
thou attitude and to say " But of course that isn't the way we keep them ",
but to take the more positive one of offering some elementary general
guidance as to what we regard as the desirable minimal dimensions;
which (other factors being favourable) should not disappoint the hopeful
novice bird-keeper, and might go some way towards meeting the objections
of those who believe that the sight of a bird deprived of the opportunity
for movement of the kind for which it was evolved is a discredit to the
culture that permits it.

Sturnus malabaricus x S. pagodarum.
John A. Purves (Edinburgh, Scotland)
The article by Mr. Raymond Franklin on the breeding of Malabar
Starlings in the November/December issue of the Avicultural Magazine
prompts me to write about my own experiences.
I had a pair of Malabar Starlings and a pair of Pagoda Starlings and
during the course of a few years I lost one of each species.
The odd bird of each pair was flying with a mixture of birds---Pekin
Robins, weavers, whydahs, etc.--in an aviary approx. 18 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft.
6 in. in 1969 and in June of that year I noticed that when I put in the
usual ration of mealworms that the starlings were not eating them but
carrying them away. A close watch revealed that they did in fact have
a nest of three young in a nest-box larger than a finch nest-box but
similar with half of the front open. The box was in the shelter fully
6 ft. from the ground. Any movement at all brought the sitting bird off
the nest and so I knew nothing about it till I saw the live food being
taken away.
The young survived for only about a week but the pair started again
in the same nest and laid four eggs. One egg was infertile but three
young were fully reared on a diet of mealworms and maggots and whatever
else the parents could find in the planted flight.
One of them had a black head like the Pagoda hen; one had a black
head with a small white patch at the front; and the front half of the third
one's head was white with the back half black.
During the winter of 69-70 the old Pagoda hen and the black-headed
young bird both died so that I was left with old cock Malabar and two
young birds which were a cock and hen.
No breeding took place during 1970 but the old cock was always with
one of the young birds and kept chasing the other bird away from the
food pots so in the spring of 1971 I placed the two of them in a smaller
aviary by themselves. Nest building, laying, incubating and hatching
took place three or four times, but the young always died when about
to leave the nest so in desperation I opened the aviary to allow the parents
to fly outside because I thought that perhaps the live food supplied was
too monotonous. For almost a week neither bird went outside and then
the hen came out and was never seen again. I can only suppose that
she got a fright and then could not find her way back to the aviary. The
cock bird never even attempted to feed the family who were now about
ten days old so this finished my breeding attempts.
The old Malabar cock died (how old I do not know but he certainly
looked old) in the autumn of 1970 so that I was left with only one 1969
youngster. He is a tough healthy bird in very pink of condition and with

happen it is most interesting to see how the young turn out and also to
prove that they are fertile.

Trachyphonus darnaudii emini
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancs., England)
D'Arnaud's Barbets are one of the Ground Barbets, and are slimmer and
more dainty than the better known members of this large colourful family.
There are five species of Trachyphonus , T. darnaudii being six inches
in length and the smallest of the genus.
The upperparts are brown, spotted and barred with white on the back,
wings and tail; underparts are yellow, spotted with black on the breast,
under tail coverts red. Forehead and crown black. The chin and throat
are black also, spreading down to the breast. The sexes are alike with the
male having a little more black on the crown and throat, and being slightly
larger.
We purchased a trio of T. darnaudii emini in 1970 and put them into one
of our glass fronted compartments with an odd bird of the T. darnaudii
species where they lived together amicably for several months. During
this time a number of holes were excavated in the soil, to varying
depths, always adjacent to either walls, rocks, or some solid object, but all
were ultimately abandoned or caved in.
Towards the latter end of 1971 our breeding pair objected to the other
two birds by chasing them around and generally harassing them, so we
removed them to another compartment for their own safety. The breeding
pair then continued excavating in various places, presumably looking for a
suitable site for nesting. They finally decided on one particular hole and
removed the soil to a depth of eighteen inches, they then made a nest
chamber to one side of the base of their hole. Until this was made the
birds had to back out of the hole tail first, as the nest chamber was enlarged
they managed to turn round and emerge head first.
It is difficult to ascertain the incubation period as the barbets continued
removing soil during this time, but to a lesser degree. The young birds
were first heard thirty days before they left the nest, but the parents were
not observed taking any food to them until almost a week later. There was
no apparent preference for live food as maggots and mealworms were fed
in more or less equal quantities by them. It was then noted that currants,

sultanas and our soft food mixture were also fed in the latter two weeks,
as also were day old mice.
During the last week that the three youngsters were in the nest the
parents again started removing soil, possibly to make more room for the
growing birds. The young birds are very similar to their parents, the only
difference being their slightly smaller size and paler colouring.
As described above the d'Arnaud's Barbet Trachyphonus darnaudii
emini has been bred at the Winged World. It is believed this may be a first
success.

fauna to develop almost entirely free from outside influence. The fauna
is not remarkably rich in species, and some widespread groups are either
absent or but poorly represented. Nevertheless, no other country has
such a wealth of endemic species or so many peculiar developments and
adaptations.
The comparatively large number of flightless birds is resultant upon
the paucity of land mammals, for lack of competition and particularly
immunity from attack by mammals, has enabled certain birds to become
ground foragers, which habit has led to heavier build and reduced wings.
The most remarkable flightless birds are the Kiwis, Apterygidae,
and the extinct Moas, Dinornis--two extremes in size--the former a
little larger than a domestic fowl and the latter up to ten feet or more in
height. Both are related to that group of southern hemisphere flightless
birds to which belong the modern Ostrich, Emu and Cassowary. The
presence of birds of this group can be explained only by the assumption
that New Zealand was once part of a great southern land mass.
A century of cultivation and acclimatisation has upset the balance of
primeval nature, causing immense changes in the native land fauna.
Some species have failed to survive altered conditions and others, once
common, are now sadly reduced in numbers, one of the species being the
Weka Rail or Woodhen ( Gallirallus australis greyi). This bird is

slightly smaller than the domestic hen; a tawny brownish and blackish
streaked bird with degenerate wings making it incapable of flight.
Sexing is very difficult indeed. Males tend to be heavier than females,
900 gms. against 700 gms. for the female. The Weka can run with great
speed, but is most inquisitive and will venture very close to human
habitations with a stealthy gait and an enquiring demeanour. In New
Zealand the breeding season is an extended one, with the peak occurring
in winter and early spring. Weka Rails are multi-brooded and pairs
have been known to nest four times in one year. Two to four eggs
comprise the clutch, the nest being concealed in thick scrub.
The Weka that we have bred is the North Island ( greyi) which has more
grey on the underparts and brown rather than reddish legs. There are
three other races which are as follows:- The Buff Weka ( hectori); this
bird was found in low rainfall districts east of the main range in the South
Island. It became extinct in its old haunts but throve at Chatham Island,
whence 16 were re-introduced in February 1962 to Arthur's Pass
National Park.
The Weka of the western region of the South Island from Nelson to
Fiordland (australis) has a streaked red-brown and black breast. In
South Westland and Fiordland it is dimorphic, the black form showing
much more black in the plumage. " Black " Wekas are not uncommon
along the Milford Track and range to the top of the Mackinnon Pass
(3,4** feet).
Gallirallus australis from South Island, according to Mr. A. A.
Prestwich, was bred at the London Zoo in 1912, two chicks hatching,
of which one was reared.
The Stewart Island Weka (scotti) is slightly smaller. It also is
dimorphic, but the black phase is less black.
During visits to New Zealand in 1963 and 1966, I was able to observe
several Wekas in the wild, and was told by an old bushman that they have
a fascination for taking small shining objects such as spoons and the
bushman complained that even watches had been taken.
The North Island Weka, once abundant everywhere, has now dis-
appeared from most districts, largely due, I was told, to the depredations
of dogs, cats, stoats and weasels. In 1915, the Weka was most abundant
from Waimauku to the Muriwai Beach, west of Auckland. Their shrill
calls could be heard any evening in considerable volume and females
with their chicks came fearlessly around camps, but today not a single
bird remains. In other areas it is still a familiar bird, especially in the
vicinity of mountain huts and weekend houses. In such places, it may
be extremely tame, even becoming a tourist attraction. I saw several
Wekas in the Gisborn area of North Island; the birds have built up from
very small numbers to high densities in the last fifty years, even feeding
and breeding in suburban gardens. Staff of the Wildlife Division have
been trapping Wekas and releasing them into areas where they have
become extinct in the hope of re-establishing them.

Wekas occupy a wide variety of habitats. They may occur in tussock
country above the tree-line, to 6,000 feet above sea level; in heavy,
temperate rain-forest, and in coastal swamps and scrubs.
The nearest allies of this endemic species are the flightless woodrails
(Trkholimas lafresnayanus) from New Caledonia.

On the 4th July 1971 a pair of North Island Weka Rails arrived from
the Auckland Zoo. After a short period of quarantine and acclimatisation,
they were liberated into a large mixed flight (106 ft. x 60 ft. x 20 ft. high)
at the rear of the New Ape House, heavily planted with trees and shrubs
and two large pools. This flight contains Herons, Ibis, Egrets, Gallinules
and Waders, along with a single female Weka which has been in the
collection since April 1964. Several days after the introduction,
courtship feeding was observed between the original female and the
newly arrived male. The female was seen to beg and to be fed by the
male. This was repeated eveiy three or four minutes, the male usually
carried the food to the female as she crouched on the ground. Sometimes
he brought her food from as far as 60 feet, even though the female was not
begging. On several occasions the male began to hop around her in
small circles with his head held high and his short tail widely spread and
flicking up and down. The female appeared to resent this courtship
display and warded off the male, by rotating her head so as always to
direct her half-opened bill at him in a threatening manner. The male

made at least twenty circles around her. Later, the female moved under
some low bushes and preened for ten minutes, during which time the
male moved to the far side of the enclosure. Suddenly the female
became alert and gave a low call Kuck-kuck-kuck, followed by louder
calls. The male appeared at once from some bushes fifty feet away and
fed her. Once he jumped about three times into the air and seized a
locust from a shrub and took it to the female, who was not begging at
that moment. She swallowed it after a little hesitation.
For several days, the male was observed feeding the female and preening
her neck and head; she would turn her head away and fluff up her neck
feathers.
Copulation starts with the male passing food objects to the female; the
usual food used appeared to be earthworms which he dug up in the
enclosure and mealworms thrown on the ground by keepers. He could
carry as many as sixteen in his bill at once. These he would feed to the
female one at a time, after which, he would preen her neck and head,
marking time while preening. He would then step onto the female's
back, first with one foot pushing very hard, which made her go into a
crouching position. Once he had both feet on her back, she would
return to a standing position or slightly crouched, sometimes with the
bill lifted slightly upwards and in a generally submissive attitude. His
position is maintained by a firm grip of the feet and much flapping of the
short wings. The tail is depressed and moves vigorously from side to
side. The neck is arched and often he would peck at the nape of the
female's neck. Mating lasts for three or four seconds, although he would
remain on her back for at least twenty seconds. During copulation
neither bird makes any calls at all.

Nest Building
The site of the nest was a small cave built out of sandstone measuring
3 ft. 2 in. x 2 ft. x 2 ft. 6 in. The nest was built in a corner of the cave,
and composed of bits of grass, pieces of rushes, twigs and a few odd feathers.
It was lined with finer grasses and moss. The nest was in an ideal
position for observation, facing a window in the New Ape House kitchen.
The Wekas could be watched without disturbing them at all, from a
distance of less than five feet.
Both male and female brought nest material and both sat on the nest
and shaped it--prodding with the bill or stamping with the feet. On
one occasion the male, arriving with a new bundle of material, literally
pushed the female off the nest. Towards the completion of the nest, I
got the impression that the male brought most of the material, while the
female did most of the sitting and shaping. As with most birds, the nest
had materials added while the birds were incubating, at least in the early
stages. During the nest building period both male and female appeared
to be very restless; the female would call loudly, Kuck-kuck-kuck,
whereupon the male would rush from whatever part of the flight he may
have been at the time, to the calling female and indulge in a short period
of communal calling, followed by begging and neck preening. This

normally lasted about 30 seconds. The birds do not bring material on
every trip to the nest. When they have been away for some time, they
frequently go directly to the nest and the female then often works for
an unusually long time. During the later stages of nest building, the
pair would remain near the nest without working on it.

Incubation
The first egg was laid within a few days of completion of the nest,
three eggs being laid within a period of five days. It was very difficult to
learn with any accuracy, the interval between the laying of each egg.
Incubation appeared to commence with the laying of the first egg. One
would assume that with Weka Rails being omnivorous eaters there would
be no eggs left if incubation began only when the clutch was complete.
Whether the adult birds sitting on the eggs for long periods of time
during the egg laying period means that the eggs are being subjected to
full incubation heat, I am not sure. This obviously depends upon the
stage of development of the brood patch and how well it is formed at the
time.
The egg is typically ralline, creamy-white with scattered brown and
light purplish blotches measuring 61 mm. x 41 mm.
Both birds took part in incubation; the changeover display when one
bird relieves the other at brooding on the nest, is done with the presenta-
tion of an earthworm, small twig or nest material. At times the bird
sitting would be unwilling to leave the nest, and did so only by being
shouldered and pushed off by its mate.
They usually spend the time away from the nest in feeding, preening
or occasionally in bathing. They would walk out into the shallow part
of the pool, bowing forward and twisting their bodies so that their heads
were dipped into the water; or lying down on one side and then on the
other, flapping quickly with their wings, the necks are moved sideways
throwing water on to the back. After a short while the wings are soaking
wet. Sometimes the bird only dips its head in and out of the water and
with a sideways movement of the head, throws water onto its back.
After bathing the Wekas usually shake themselves, fan out the wings
and shake their heads and bodies several times. They then spend a
considerable time preening and drying their feathers by adopting a
sunning posture; now and then there is vigorous flapping of the wings.
The male often indulged in squabbles with other birds in the flight,
especially with a pair of Pond Herons who had a nest a short distance
from the Wekas' territory. The female spent more time in preening or
quietly standing under the cover of shrubs, than did the male.
Swimming was observed only once, when the male swam across the
top pool. The body was held high out of the water, the head jerking
rhythmically backwards and forwards and the short tail flicking up and
down.
The eggs were turned by the sitting bird at varying times during the
day--I was unable to record any observations at night. In most cases it
was noted that after the eggs were turned--with the beak and legs--the
bird also turned around to face another direction on the nest. The
incubation period was 26 days and when the eggs were about to hatch,
the bird turned them more frequently.

Two eggs hatched and within four hours the chicks had left the nest
and were hiding under vegetation several yards away. No feeding was
observed at all and the parents appeared very nervous. Several times
both male and female attacked and drove off Pond Herons, Glossy Ibis
and Maned Geese from the vicinity of the chicks. The Wekas fluff out
their body feathers thus increasing their apparent size and fan their
drooping wings all the time, making a deep booming sound. The
following day both chicks had vanished, possibly eaten by a pair of
Common Herons or Nankeen Night Herons.
Within five days the female was sitting again on the same nest and
incubated for 27 days from the laying of the first egg, three eggs being
laid as at the first time.
The Chicks
The chicks could be heard chirping in the eggs before and during
hatching. At 9.50 one morning an egg was chipped and the egg tooth
and pait of the head was showing; slight cracks were visible in a second
egg. At 10.44 a.m. the eggs were in a different position, cracks down;
these had been turned by the sitting bird. At 11.30 a.m. a chick had
emerged and half of the shell had disappeared, the other half was still
round the tail end of the chick.
The second chick hatched the following morning, almost twenty-four
hours after the first. I was able to watch the final stage of hatching
and saw the chick squirming and rotating slowly in the shell in such a
way that its head turned under one wing, moving backwards; the upper
edge of the bill was constantly brought to bear against a fresh portion of
the shell which was then chipped off with each outward push. With
each push the chick emitted a very weak cry. Even before breaking the
shell, the chicks understood the calls of the parent birds, ceasing their
subdued chirping the moment they heard the alarm or anxiety call,
tewk-tewk-tewk.
Upon leaving the eggshell, the young Weka lay wet and exhausted in
the nest, alongside the first chick. No help at all was given by the parent
in attendance. The chicks dried very quickly, eyes wide open and both
very alert; they were almost jet black in colour with a very slight trace of
light grey. The male took half an egg shell which was just outside the
nest and dropped it some thirty feet or so from the nest.
At first the chicks were brooded almost continuously. Usually each
parent remained covering them until the other arrived with food. It
would appear that the chicks were not fed very frequently for the first
few days and the brooding continued constantly for about six days. The
sitting birds became very agitated if the chicks moved from under them.
On the 10th day, I noted that the chicks were allowed to move around
the outside of the nesting cave, even going up to ten feet away before the
sitting bird called them back. On occasions a chick refused to return to

the nest and it was carried by the brooding parent who picked it up by
the nape of the neck and dropped it into the nest area. Several
Ornithologists have reported seeing adult Water-rails (Rallus aquaticus )
carrying young in their bills.
Feeding the Chicks
The chicks beg by crouching and then standing upright, follow by
touching the bill of the parent, who then gives the begging chick whatever
it has in its beak--earthworms, mealworms, maggots, etc. On several
occasions, I thought I could see small quantities of saliva being passed
by the feeding adult along with the insect food. It appears that when the
chick is young and not demanding large quantities of food, the adult
Weka can store food in its crop or gullet, as I quite often observed
regurgitated food which the chick took from near the tip of the beak of
the adult. This is done several times until the chick is satisfied, when it
then settles down and begins to doze.
As the chicks grow in size they move further away from the nest
although the parents continue to be very concerned about them and in
the event of anything strange occurring, the adults would give an alarm
call--Koo-koo-koo, whereupon the chicks would crouch down on the
ground or run for cover under the nearest available shrub or tussock of
grass and wait for the all-clear.
The food of the Weka consists largely of insects which they obtain
both from the ground and among low foliage and to a much smaller
extent of berries and other fruits. They vary their diet with an occasional
small mammal and possibly nestling birds. A friend of mine in New
Zealand observed a Weka catch a green Gecko (Naultinus elegans) and
states that they catch and eat the brown Skink (Lygosoma moco) and a
fascinating insect called the large-headed Weat (Hemideina megacephala)
which one hears in most parts of New Zealand making a peculiar scraping
sound by rubbing their hind legs against ridges on the sides of the body.

The body of this remarkable insect grows to about 2 in. in length and
the antennae are up to 4 in. long. They apparently belong to the Cricket
family.
In our large flight they hunt for insects among the long grass and low
shrubs. Each day we release locusts of various sizes and allow the Wekas
to hunt them naturally. From time to time one would see a Weka leap
a foot or so above the herbage to snatch an insect which had tried to
escape. Digging for earthworms appears to be their favourite occupation
and this is done very efficiently. Usually the male searches for food in
the ground and the head is swung from side to side with the bill pointed
in the direction of movement. Spurts of soil are thrown first to one side
and then to the other. The male is followed by the female who does the
actual worm catching. She in turn passes worms to the chicks who
wait a few feet away from all the activity. The birds tend to comb a
very restricted area thoroughly and patches of ground become completely

broken up. I understand that on Macquarie Island where Wekas were
introduced as food for sealers and whalers, the topsoil in areas has been
lost by erosion through the persistent probing of Wekas hunting for
earthworms. Witnessing the damage done to our turf in the flight, I
can easily visualise the problem on Macquarie Island.
Besides live food, we feed hard boiled egg, minced meat, chopped
grapes, pears and apples, ripe elderberries being hung from various
shrubs when in Season. An occasional pinch of calcium phosphate and
a few drops of multivitamin are added to the egg and meat. Reading
that Wekas also eat snails, I presented them with about three dozen
garden snails {Helix aspersa) 4 cm. wide and about 3.7 cm. high, which I

had collected from the Cots wolds. These were scattered over a wide
area of the flight and after a few minutes the male found a snail and
examined it by turning it over and picking it up with his beak. Several
times he banged the snail on the soft ground and eventually carried it to
an outcrop of sandstone and hit the snail on the solid surface several
times before it broke into pieces. The snail was swallowed without
sub-dividing.
The male found a hairy caterpillar about if in. long and took it to a
bare sandy patch and rubbed it vigorously back and forth in the sandy
soil for several seconds. He then fed it to one of the chicks, who
swallowed if after some hesitation. After the chick had swallowed the
caterpillar, it spent several minutes cleaning its beak on a tuft of grass by
rubbing one side and then the other. I got the impression that this
food was not enjoyed at all.
During the next few days, most of the snails had been brought to the
" anvil " and smashed. On two other occasions, I observed the male
inserting snails into a crevice on a tree trunk and then proceeding to
hammer them until they broke into fragments.
I purchased three North Italian Wall Lizards (Lacerta sicula campestris)
about 20 cm. long, and released all three into the flight in order to observe
their reaction to this unusual type of food. The male chased one of the
lizards as soon as it was released and caught it by the tail, only to be left
with a piece of violently wriggling tail in its beak, while the lizard
scuttled away to safety under some sandstone. The tail was eaten after
a little investigation.
The two chicks continued to thrive and at four weeks had lost most of
the fluffy blackish down and began to look like the adults, with the
exception of the legs, which were reddish instead of brown, the grey body
patches being much paler.
At seven weeks, they appeared almost independent; only very occasionally
would one see any feeding by the parents and this tended to be new born
mice or large locusts which had to be pulled into suitable pieces, in order
to swallow them. This is done by a tug-of-war method, the adult on one
end and the chick on the other, pulling until something gives way. Quite
often the chick fell over backwards as the food item broke in two.
After the chicks had left the nest, two more nests were built, one in a
second cave and the other under an evergreen shrub. These nests were
used during extremes of weather, the nest under the shrub being used by
the parent bird and chicks during very hot spells and the cave nest
during wet and cold weather. I found the use of these nests very
amusing, because the two chicks by this time were quite large and had
great difficulty in trying to get under the adult because of their size and
had to be content with huddling together, one under each wing of the
parent.

In April of 1971 Mr. Ronald Austing, a well known U.S. student of
birds and naturalist photographer, discovered the nest of an American
Woodcock (Philohela minor) of which he proceeded to do a photographic
study. The hen soon abandoned the four chicks and Mr. Austing
undertook the job of hand raising them. He enlisted the help of the
Zoological Society of Cincinnati in supplying earth worms for the chicks'
tremendous appetites.
On 18th May 1971 the chicks were presented to the Zoological Society
of Cincinnati. Director Edward Maruska and Head Keeper of the bird
house Vernon Oswald decided on a cage perfectly suited for the new
birds. The cage picked was a newly decorated one which was lined
completely with fibreglass for waterproofing and ease of cleaning. The
cage measures six feet wide, five feet deep and eight feet high. A
simulated stream runs the width of the cage. The foreground up to the
glass viewing area is covered with two inches of moist sand. Behind the
stream to the rear of the cage a slope is covered with four inch deep
sifted earth. A stump and small shrub are added for a more natural effect.
The woodcocks were soon introduced to the new area and adjusted to
it extremely well. Our only concern was the huge amount of earth

worms that would be needed, so a program to condition the birds to
ground meat was started. The young birds accepted the meat without
any hesitation and now eagerly seek it out. A diet of four oz. ground
horse meat with vitamins and minerals, moistened with water is fed
daily at 8 a.m. along with a handful of earthworms occasionally laced
with meal worms. At 12.30 p.m. the morning meat dish is removed
and a fresh one replaces it. At present the young birds are thriving on
this regimen.
The woodcocks have become most calm and are not bothered in the
least by the daily cage cleaning, twice daily feeding or the viewing public.
The stream and bedding in the cage make it a most attractive display
both for the public and the birds. To see the birds probing into the
earth and moist sand for the worms in their natural manner is most
satisfying.
The Cincinnati Zoo's constant effort to place compatible animals of
different types together for the benefit of both animal and public, led to
the introduction of a pair of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis) to the exhibit.
This mixing had the effect of making both types of birds much more
calm and the added natural effect makes it a most intriguing display.
The young birds, three female and one male, have not presented us
with any problems whatsoever. (Dimorphism has been determined by
general body size and bill length.) All are very healthy and eating well.
No records can be found for these birds being successfully maintained
in an artificial environment. Several attempts to keep them have
been tried both at our own zoo and others but all have failed within
weeks. The seven months they have been with us appears to be a record.
The viewing public has found the woodcocks a most fascinating exhibit
and comments constantly about it. Here is a good example of the
display of a little seen but common bird being fascinating and most of all
informative to visitors to institutions such as ours.

We have been very pleased with our Flamingo colony which has
already been breeding since 1963 on a muddy island in one of our lakes.
Apart from a European Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus ruber roseus), six Chilean
Flamingos [Phoenicopterus chilensis ) have been brought up in 1971. We
do hope that these fine successes in breeding will continue, for even now
successful breeding results of Flamingos are not a matter of course in
zoological gardens.
To be specially mentioned among the great number of gallinaceous
birds, which almost without exception have been hatched in the incubator,
are five Ocellated Turkeys ( Agriocharis ocellata ), one Great Argus
( Argusianus argus), 11 Gennaeus l. leucomelanus as well as one Vieillot's
Crested Fireback ( Lophura ignita rufa). In the Tanager-aviary opposite
the main entrance of the Bird House our pair of Crowned Wood Partridges
(Rollulus roulroul ) hatched two charming young only the size of a thimble.
They were cared for and guided carefully, yet to our regret they were not
brought up.
After a long interval, in the little open-air enclosure near the sea lion
exhibit, two Peruvian Penguins ( Spheniscus humboldti) were again hatched
but--we are sorry to say--died a short time later. A similar fate hap-
pened to an American White Pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchus) incubated
in June in the Pheasantry: the bird had not drawn in the bag of yolk
completely and died after four days.
Worth mentioning are also the rearing of two Black-billed Whistling
Ducks ( Dendrocygna arbor ea), two Gad wall (Anas s. strepera) and two
Moluccan or Black-Backed Radjah Shelducks (Tadorna radjah). All
these species breed only rarely in zoological gardens. With these
' delicate " species the Andean Crested Duck (Lophonetta specularoides
alticola) may be included and three young have been hatched by the
parents, but did not survive. Two young Black Swans ( Cygnus atratus)
and three Black-necked Swans ( Cygnus melanocoryphus) were reared
successfully.
The breeding successes in birds of prey and owls were remarkable.
We intend to introduce the young female of the Andean Condor ( Vultur
gryphus) mentioned in our last news, to the male which hatched in 1970.
Unnoticed by the keeper and visitors this year the Crested Caracaras
(Polyborus plancus) began breeding for the first time. In June the pair
had appeared very aggressive towards the other inhabitants of the aviary,
but further particulars had not been observed. Looking back, this proved
to be an advantage for perhaps the birds would have resented controls of
the nest and would have been disturbed in breeding. As it was, the
rearing of one young bird succeeded without any difficulties. Towards

the end of the year it is distinguishable from its parents only by a somewhat
lighter colour of the plumage. Whether other zoos have been successful
in breeding these representatives of the South American Caracaras, we
do not yet know. All Caracaras live in open terrain, especially in steppes
or on coasts. Their long legs portend that they live a great deal on the
ground, where they look for carcasses. The range of this group of bird
extends from the South of the U.S.A. to Tierra del Fuego.
For years we have kept a male Common Buzzard ( Buteo b. buteo ) with a
female Red-tailed Hawk {Buteo jamaicensis borealis). The female laid
an egg on nth May 1971, and hatched a young which at first was well
cared for but after a few days suddenly vanished. We presume that it was
eaten by the parents.
Our three young European Eagle-Owls {Bubo bubo) have been given to
the Braunschweig bird-sanctuary which is endeavouring to re-establish
this largest native owl in the Harz.

of Birds at the Bronx Zoo. Completed by the general contractors early
in 1971, all of the Park's exhibition and technical specialists have since been
involved in the interior decor of this new facility, creating ponds, waterfalls,
craggy cliffs and background paintings. By the year's end, eleven of the
twenty-five exhibits were completed, planted and inhabited by birds.
The new building is scheduled to open to the public in June, 1972.
Among the many birds acquired for the World of Birds exhibits, the
following were new to the collection:

Once again as in 1970, the breeding season was distinguished more by the
variety than by the number of species reared. In all, 220 birds of 43 species
were raised in 1971. Some of the more noteworthy successes were: one
Pileated Heron Pilherodius pileatus , a species rarely hatched in captivity;
two Wattled Cranes Burger anus carunculatus\ three White-quilled Black
Bustards Afrotis afra afraoides\ one Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides ;
one Uganda Double-toothed Barbet Lybius bidentatus aequatorialis and two
Natal Pigmy Kingfisher Ispidina picta. A pair of Little Black Rails
Limnocorax flavirostris , acquired early in 1971 nested four times and
reared nine chicks by the year's end.
The greatest disappointments of the season were four Tufted Puffin,
Lunda cirrhata , eggs that failed to hatch and a single North Pacific Murre,
Uria aalge inornata, hatchling that lived just short of one week.

Dr. Alan Lendon has bred an African Grey Parrot--an uncommon
event in captivity anywhere and certainly in Australia.
An account by K. Bastien of the rearing of three youngsters by his
Sharp-tailed Conures ( Aratinga acuticauda acuticauda) appeared in a
recent issue of " Cage and Aviary Birds ". It is doubtful whether this
species has been bred before in captivity.

B. C. Sayers writes " My Barn owls have made a major contribution to
this years' breeding results. The pair have reared 10 young in three
nests (3, 2 and 5), the first egg of the third clutch being laid on 1st
September. The same female laid a further clutch of six eggs during
the early part of this month (December 1971). However, I removed the
eggs and nesting hide in the hopes that she would take a rest, but on
18th December I found that once again she had started to lay and was
incubating two eggs on the concrete floor of the aviary. In desperation
I returned the nesting hide and today (20th December) she was contentedly
incubating three eggs ".

From the Hobart " Mercury " 13th March 1971: " Four sightings of
the little known Ground Parrot were made by an observer walking in
Tasmania's South-West early in March. There are not many of these
Parrots and they have a large slice of country over which to roam. They
do not move in flocks but in pairs. They nest on the ground under a bush
or clump of grass and are never found perching in trees. Ground
Parrots are handsome birds. Their bodies are bright green flecked with
dark brown and gold. They have a red patch on the forehead and a
long gold and green tail. Although they occur in coastal districts in
Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, Tasmania
is their stronghold ".

If I were compelled to keep only one pair of birds I should have no
hesitation in selecting the species. I should choose a pair of Splendid
Grass Parrakeets which nature has endowed with all the beauty, charm and
other requirements of the ideal aviary bird. For those who find its
combination of blues, scarlet, green and yellow too garish there is a blue
mutation in which the green is replaced by blue, the scarlet by a pale
pinkish apricot and the yellow by cream or white. In some males the

blue is particularly intense and the entire chest, breast and abdomen are
white giving them the appearance of a Psittacine equivalent of the
Japanese Blue Flycatcher. This exquisite mutation is gradually being
established in some British aviaries, it is rumoured that there are a few
specimens in Holland but, apparently, it has almost died out in Australia
where it originated about io years ago.

During the past few months several specimens of the " Island " King
Parrakeets (. Alisterus amboiniensis ) have been imported. These are
different from the other members of the genus Alisterus in being much
darker red and green and, more remarkably, in that the males are almost
identical with the females. They inhabit Northern New Guinea, the
Moluccas and the Celebes and several subspecies are recognized which
differ mainly in the extent of blue on the back. The nominate race
(Alisterus amboiniensis amboiniensis) from Ceram and Amboina has only
the mantle bright blue, the Salawati race (A. a dorsalis) has the entire
back and rump blue and the subspecies from Halmahera (A. a hypophonius)
has blue wings as well. The late Ted Vane, whom many aviculturists
remember as the authority on parrots, possessed a hen Salawati King
which never bred but which killed two Australian King males in quick
succession. The Duke of Bedford described them as " fierce birds,
addicted to murder " but he succeeded in breeding hybrids from a
female of the Sula Island race (A. a . sulaensis) and a male Crimson-winged
Parrakeet. According to Vane the species has been bred in captivity
" once in 1940, when no observations were recorded ". Both the
nominate race and the Salawati subspecies have been offered for sale
recently and have been snapped up at enormous prices. Unfortunately,
like so many Parrots handled by dealers, some have been too disease-
ridden to survive but others appear to have been established successfully.
Some successful breedings might justify the removal of these majestic
creatures from their island habitat.

It is almost 25 years since a short article which I wrote on the birds of
New Zealand was published in the Avicultural Magazine. During the
year I lived in that lovely country I spent much of my spare time in
places where the native bush had escaped destruction and where it was
still possible to see many of the delightful species of birds like the Bell-bird
and Tui which are found only in New Zealand. But I was very dis-
appointed by the Government's attitude to aviculturists for, at that time,
it was illegal to keep any species of New Zealand bird in captivity.
However, in the last decade or so the N.Z. Government, which has been
conservation conscious for a long time, has begun to recognize the part
that aviculture may play in helping to conserve rare species. Licensing
aviculturists to keep the attractive Yellow-fronted and Red-fronted
Parrakeets (Cyanoramphus auriceps and C. novae-zeelandiae) was a start
and it was not long before both species were being bred in very large
numbers in aviaries all over the country. In 1961, the Wildlife Branch
of the Department of Internal Affairs established the Mount Bruce
Native Bird Reserve to provide facilities for the holding and breeding in
captivity of endangered species. I spent an enjoyable and interesting
day there just over a year ago and was very impressed by the strides that
are being made. Both the Blue Duck and the Brown Duck were breeding
well as also was the very rare Eastern Weka. A range of aviaries had
been constructed which houses pairs of uncommon passerine species
including Stitch birds and Saddlebacks. The Saddleback (Creadion
carunculatus) is closely related to the probably extinct Huia and like it
has orange wattles on its cheeks. It is about the size of a Mistle Thrush.
The " saddle " is a patch of bright orange-red across the back and wings
while the rest of the plumage is glossy black. I had never before seen
living examples of this beautiful species and I was surprised and delighted
to learn that it was being successfully bred in the Reserve. If the Curator
is still a member of this Society (he was at the time of my visit judging by
the prominence of a row of Avicultural Magazines on the bookshelves
in his office!) perhaps he would let us have some information on the
interesting and important collection in his care.

Canberra in the period 12th August to 17th August 1974. A programme
of scientific sessions, major and minor excursions and ornithological
exhibits will be organized.
Applications for membership will be accepted until 1st March 1974.
Applications for the presentation of papers and for arranging Specialist's
Meetings should reach the Secretary-General not later than 1st February,

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.971554816326531" page_id="56367260"  page_num="73" year="" vol="">
Reference to any work on vanishing or extinct species shows that the last known
Carolina Parrakeet Conuropsis carolinensis carolinensis in captivity died in the
Cincinnati Zoo, in 1914: some authors have even given the date as 1st September,
apparently confusing that of the death of the last Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes
migratorius which also died in the Cincinnati Zoo.
In 1973 the Cincinnati Zoological Gardens celebrates its centenary and in
connection with this event the eminent American bird artist John A. Ruthven
proposed making a painting of the Carolina Parakeet, using the last captive survivor
as a model. But where was the skin? To George Lay cock fell the task of locating
it. Easy enough one would have thought but, unfortunately, there are no records
of so early a date in existence at the Cincinnati Zoo. George Laycock has described
his very extensive search, in some detail, in Audubon , 1969, March, 21-25, with
colour plate by John A. Ruthven. The account has been reproduced in South
Carolina Wildlife , Summer, 1969: American Cage-Bird Magazine, 1970, December,
39-40; 1971, January, 29-30; February, 34-36: and in part in Foreign Birds
(F.B.L.), 1971, May-June, 102-108. The skin was not found but George Laycock
unearthed a very illuminating item, in the Cincinnati Times-Star, Friday, February
22nd, 1918. It is of sufficient interest to warrant reproduction in these pages:

the New York Zoo was especially eager to obtain the birds. After the death of the
female, various zoos renewed offers for the survivor, but Col. [ffc] Stephan would
not part with the bird. Just how old the parrakeet was is not known. The bird
was well-aged when it, with its mate, was obtained by the Zoo 32 years ago.
"The Carolina parrakeet family was the only real American parrot ", said Colonel
Stephan, Friday. ' There was a time when the family was a numerous one. But
a curious trait in the make-up of the family proved its undoing. The parrakeets
would fly in thick flocks and, if a hunter fired into them, they would wheel and
come right back to the scene of the shooting as if curious to see what caused the
explosion and to learn why some of their number fell to the ground. So by their
foolishness the Carolina parrakeets gradually were shot out of existence as a
family ".
Colonel Stephan will have the bird mounted and, in accordance with a promise
made by him some years ago, will present the specimen to the Smithsonian
Institution."
The skin never arrived at the Smithsonian Institution, but it is just possible that
it is displayed in the Cincinnati Museum of Natural History, without a data label
of any kind.

Ask almost any aviculturist the meaning of "aviary" and he will probably
mumble something about a flight and avis--a bird. Later he may consult a
dictionary to check his " definition ".
The word is derived from the Latin Aviarium used by Cicero (106-43 B.C.) to
denote a place where birds were kept, a poultry-yard: and by Virgil (70-19 B.C.)
as the resort of wild birds in a forest. Dr. Thomas Fuller (1608-1661), the
English antiquarian and divine, had the same meaning in mind when he said that
" Lincolnshire may be termed the aviary of England, for the wildfowl therein ".
Nowadays an aviary is understood to be a large cage, house, or enclosure, in which
birds are kept, with the object of studying their habits and, if possible, inducing
them to breed successfully under conditions as nearly as practicable approaching
those found in Nature.
The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first use of the word aviary as: " 1577,
Harrison, England III, ii, 17. Our costlie and curious aviaries". The
Superintendent, The British Museum, Department of Printed Books, has taken
considerable trouble to trace this reference and kindly writes: " I have not been
able to find this reference in the 1577 edition; chapter ii of Book III concerns
" our apparell and attire " and it does not occur in either chapters ix or xi which
concern " wylde and tame Foules " and " Hawkes and ravenous Foules ". It does
however occur in the 1587 edition in Book III, chap, ii " Of wild and tame foules ",
line 48.
The correct bibliographical citation of the work is as follows:

USE OF THE FOOT BY PARROTS WHEN FEEDING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985165666666667" page_id="56367261"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
I wish to thank G. A. Smith for his interesting article on the use of the foot by
parrots when feeding ( Avic . Mag., 77, pp. 93-100, 1971). This well-known
behavioural trait is seldom mentioned in the literature, and aviculturists are in a
good position to obtain information. I would like to comment on some of Mr.
Smith's claims and give some information for Opopsitta.
Mr. Smith states that the Nestorinae are seldom "prehensile-footed" when
feeding, but does concede that Kakas ( Nestor meridionalis ) can hold food in this
way. I have photographs from Kapiti Island, New Zealand, showing Kakas
feeding and some birds are holding food in a normal " prehensile-footed " position.
I believe that with this species " prehensile-footed " feeding is not at all uncommon.
The claim that Geoffroyus is "prehensile-footed" does not agree with my
observations on wild birds. Birds I have observed feeding made no use whatever
of the foot, but Bell (pers. comm.) has observed " tether-footed " feeding.
I have had in captivity for three years a male Red-browed Fig Parrot ( Opopsitta
diophthalma macleayana) and this bird never uses the foot when feeding; I have

In the September-October issue of Avicultural Magazine I invited Mr. G. A.
Smith to comment further on his suggestion that there is a correlation between
sexual dimorphism and the inability to use the foot for feeding in parrots. His
explanation in the November-December issue is both ingenious and convincing,
and I must both thank him and congratulate him.
On the matter of the relationship between Amazona xantholora and A. albifrons ,
I am afraid that Mr. Smith is on shakier ground. What may or may not happen
elsewhere when two or more Amazon parrots are sympatric is irrelevant to the
consideration of this case. Contrary to Mr. Smith's statement, A. xantholora and
A. albifrons have indeed evolved differences in habitat preference in their area of
sympatry, although there is overlap. Paynter (" The ornithogeography of the
Yucatan Peninsula", Peabody Mus. Nat. Hist. Yale Univ. Bull. 9, 1955: 125)
states: " It appears . . . that A. xantholora is more abundant in the deciduous forest,
and A. albifrons in the rain forest. Although at times both species may occur in
the same general area, I have never found them associated in a single flock (nor
did Paynter know of any other worker who had, but a mixed flock has subsequently
been reported at least once), and always one species is more abundant than the
other, depending on the nature of the habitat." This evidence certainly strongly
suggests a partial ecological separation. The occasional formation of mixed flocks
(Klaas, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 17, 1968: 591) argues for, not
against species status.
Mr. Smith suggests that these two Amazons resemble such well-known cases as
the Carrion and Hooded Crows Corvus c. corone and C. c. cornix which form a
"hybrid zone". This is precisely the kind of case that the Amazons do not
resemble, as none of the many collectors that have worked on the Yucatan Peninsula
has ever, to my knowledge, taken an intermediate specimen. Further, both of the
crows have extensive ranges of their own, whereas the range of Amazona xantholora
is almost entirely encompassed by that of A. albifrons (the exceptions being Isla
Cozumel and probably the drier portions of the deciduous forest that dominates
the northern part of the peninsula). There is no doubt that the two are closely
related, and A. xantholora probably is derived from a once-isolated population of
A. albifrons, but they must now be considered sibling species rather than con-
species. I think a better comparison than the crows from the European avifauna
would be the Red Crossbill Loxia curvirostra and the Parrot Crossbill
L. pytyopsittacus. The breeding range of the latter is encompassed by that of the
former; there is a habitat preference but it is not complete; mixed flocks may occur
outside the breeding season but both species usually occur in pure flocks; and there
is little doubt that, although now acting as a good species, the Parrot Crossbill
must have evolved from a population of the Red Crossbill.
It is an amusing afterthought that I had already selected the example from the
</bodyText>

genus Loxia before I realized the coincidence in comparing Amazona xantholora
to the Parrot Crossbill!

NOTES ON THE FRILLED COQUETTE
HUMMING BIRD

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
All members of the genus Lophornis are very beautiful, although some
can perhaps, be considered a little bizarre due to their highly ornamental
feathering. It is rare indeed for any to reach Britain and the only species
I have owned so far is the Frilled Coquette, L. magnified.
I purchased a male in September, 1968. At first this bird was housed
in a large flight cage together with a male Wire-crested Thorntail,
Popelairia popelairii } and a male Raquet-tailed Coquette, Discosura
longicauda. All lived together amicably until the first moult had been
completed, when the Thorntail although not actually becoming aggressive,
did worry the Frilled somewhat by continually displaying to him.
Because of this, I decided to house the Frilled on its own and I transferred
it to a cage 48 in. by 16 in. by 16 in. To allow plenty of flying space,
the cage was only furnished with two perches, one at each end, and a
small saucer (I use those taken from a coffee set for really tiny hummers)
of water which was placed on a 1 lb jam jar near the centre of the cage.
I have had this Coquette nearly 3J years at the time of writing and it is
only during the last couple of months or so that I have seen it actually
venture far enough into the saucer of water to take a proper bath. Up
until then, it had only sat on the edge and dipped its head into the water,
then turned around and dipped its tail in. Because of this reluctance to
bathe, I have always sprayed the Coquette at least once a week, usually
prior to cleaning the cage out.
This reluctance to bathe in captivity is not common to the species, as
two Coquettes I purchased a few months ago, took to the saucers at once
and both have taken a proper bath at least once a day since I have owned
them.
The Frilled started its first moult in captivity during February, 1969;
this took 15 weeks to complete. As the bird was in poor feather at the
time of purchase, I had allowed it to feed from a perch. As soon as it
had completed the moult, however, I moved the nectar tube to the centre

78 A. J. MOBBS-NOTES ON THE FRILLED COQUETTE HUMMINGBIRD
of the cage and the bird was forced to hover for its food. Subsequent
moults have not taken quite so long to complete as the first and they have
presented no problems whatsoever.
This species seems to have no song, in fact the only sounds I have
heard my Coquette make is a weak " twitting " note uttered occasionally
when on the wing and a high pitched whining note, used only when the
bird is disturbed at night. This " whine " is not peculiar to the Frilled
Coquette as I have heard a number of the smaller species of hummingbirds
use it when disturbed at night.
The Frilled does not appear to be highly insectivorous. My bird does
take perhaps twenty fruit-flies each day, but compared to many species,
this is relatively few. The Coquette does not hawk these flies, but
prefers to pick them from a surface, tossing them into the air and
swallowing them with gaping beak, all in one deft movement. A
characteristic of this species, is the tail-wagging which is kept up con-
tinuously while the bird is in flight.
The display of this species is quite remarkable. The tail is fanned and
held forward under the body; the crest is also fanned and brought
forward; the frills are extended to their utmost. The bird then commences
to display by moving its body up and down very rapidly. The display
is terminated by the bird moving its body from side to side, again very
rapidly. During the final movements, the bird's body moves so fast it is
difficult for the eye to follow and it always amazes me that the bird is
able to remain airborne. Perhaps I should emphasize it is the body of
the bird which moves, the head being held directly in front of the object
of display throughout the procedure.
I believe this species includes aerobatics as part of its display in the
wild. In the confines of a cage, it is of course, impossible for my bird to
attempt these. When in breeding condition, my Coquette displays
many times throughout the day. Mostly the display is directed at the
feeding tube, probably because of the red lip.
The outstanding features of the male Frilled Coquette are the fan-like
frills on each side of the neck, which are white tipped with a crescent-shaped
bar of glittering green, and the erectile crest which is rich chestnut, as is
the tail. Throat and forehead are glittering emerald green. As with all
Lophornis , there is a conspicuous band across the rump, which in this
species is white.
Very little space is given over to the descriptions of female hummingbirds
in the books I have read and it is rare to find an illustration of a female in
other than some of the very old works. As most Lophornis females
seem to be very much alike, except for their different coloured rump
bands and beaks, it has been impossible to identify correctly the few
female Coquettes I have seen, if indeed they were actually females and
not immature males. A few months ago, I purchased two more Coquettes,
but until I have moulted them both out, it is impossible to tell whether

they are females or immature males. To hazard a guess, I would say
they are possibly one of each, as one has shining green feathers on the
upper parts and also a number of shining green feathers dotted about the
throat, whereas the other bird has a dull rufous coloured throat and the
feathers on the upper parts have no shine to them.
Compared to other families of birds, very little is written about the
hummingbirds and it would be of great help to enthusiasts like myself, if
aviculturists who have moulted immature birds into adult plumage,
would summarise their findings and submit them to the editor for
publication.

Though formerly treated as subspecies, the three forms of umbrellabirds
are now regarded by many ornithologists as distinct species. The
bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis) is restricted to
Costa Rica and northwestern Panama while the other two species enjoy
much larger ranges in South America. The ornate or Amazonian
umbrellabird (C. ornatus) inhabits the tropical zone of British Guiana,
Venezuela, eastern Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, northern Bolivia and
Brazil north of the Amazon, whereas the long-wattled umbrellabird
(C. penduliger) ranges through tropical and subtropical Colombia and
Ecuador west of the Andes.
The first umbrellabird known to science was collected in the Amazon
basin between 1783 and 1793, but it was not until 1809 that it was described
by Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire. To this day, over 150 years later, the natural
history of these intriguing cotingas is obscure.
Umbrellabirds are extremely heavily muscled birds with very large,
powerful grasping feet. Their grasp is strong enough to break the skin.
They are not at all reluctant to bite and often snap their bills shut with a
loud click. They lack the bright, gaudy coloration of many of the cotingas,
but their fancy adornments more than compensates for this. These
birds are named for their prominent crest that covers the head, somewhat
like an umbrella. The crest of C. ornatus , the most developed of the
three, may measure over 5 cm. in length. It is very thick, divided hair
fine at the ends and curves laterally. The bird possesses considerable
muscular control over the crest and can position it according to its mood.
During courtship the crest is thrown forward whereas it is usually
depressed to the rear during flight. The wattle also is usually held

close to the breast when the bird is flying. All three species resemble
a large crow both in size and colour.
The three forms are relatively easy to distinguish from one another.
Costa Rican birds (C. glabricollis) are noted for their conspicuous bare
necks and throats. The wattle is least developed in this species and is
bare, except for a small area at the distal end of the appendage. During
the breeding season the bare throat becomes deep scarlet. The males are
able to distend it considerably. The eyes of both sexes are dark, the
plumage of the females is more grey than black.
The wattle of C. ornatus is relatively flat and measures 8 cm. on the
males and a mere 2 cm. on the females. The feathers covering the
wattle may extend down an additional 7 cm. The skin around the throat
and wattle is scantily feathered, bare in places and very dark. In contrast
to C. glabricollis and C. penduliger the iris of both sexes is whitish-grey to
whitish-blue. The plumage is deep black with a metallic blue tint on
the outer margins of the feathers. The beak is strong. It is black on the
dorsum and blue-grey on the ventral surface. The legs are black. The
crest feathers have conspicuous white shafts. When courting, the male
spreads its crest and extends it outward and forward. When totally
extended, the crest obscures the beak and inhibits frontal vision.
The wattle reaches its greatest development in C. penduliger where it
reaches a length of 35 cm. in adult males. Females and immature males
have much less conspicuous wattles. The senior author has noted that
adult males have great muscular control over the wattle and can lengthen
or shorten it with ease. The underwing coloration of both sexes is a
mottled white. Females of all three species are slightly smaller than
males.
The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully maintained three pairs of long-
wattled umbrellabirds for four and a half years. Upon arrival, all
were extremely thin, with the sturnum plainly visible. One of our first
major obstacles was to overcome their reluctance to eat, and most were
force fed for a period of time. In this respect we have seen that young
birds adapt more rapidly than the adults.
In January, 1969 the senior author travelled to Ecuador to familiarize
himself with the habits and habitat of these marvellous birds. The area
selected was approximately 75 kilometres from Guayaquil and consisted
mainly of primary growth with large, tall trees. However, due to Indian
agricultural activity in the area, much of the habitat has been destroyed.
The site was 1500 to 2000 metres above sea level and is usually covered
with low clouds or fog.
The local natives say that umbrellabirds never descend to the ground.
Even though they are a highly arboreal species, the literature suggests
that occasionally they may forage on the ground. (We have not observed
this at any time with captive specimens.) In their natural environment
they spend most of their time at the 18 to 20 metre level. Those that

find their way in to captivity are caught by the natives with mist nets set
approximately 18 metres from the ground. The set may be three nets or
9 metres tall. The birds are very elusive and difficult to net. Indian
trappers claim the males usually appear first, followed by one or more
females. Most are netted during the early morning or evening hours
when feeding activity is greatest. They do, however, feed throughout
the day. The Indians also claim they are easier to catch when it is
raining as the rain apparently forces them to fly lower and they become
less cautious.
Although they are reported to be very rare, this may be due to the
elusiveness and shyness of the species. In three days of netting, three
adult males were collected and there was evidence of others in the area.
Their call is extremely loud and has been discribed by Cordier
(referring to C. glabricollis) as the growling of a distant jaguar, to the
far-away mooing of cattle. In Ecuador they are referred to by the
Indians as " Vaca del Monte " or mountain cattle and in some cases the
" bull-bird 55 .
Although they are strong fliers, their flight is slow and somewhat
clumsy. Helmut Sick indicates he has observed them crossing the
Xingu River where it was 800 metres wide. As to be expected of a
canopy dweller, the wings are relatively broad and short. They move
through trees by a series of long springs or interrupted flying jumps.
They are very noisy when they move and often they land on thin branches,
causing them to sag considerably, rustling loudly.
The exact nesting season of these birds is unknown, but it is probably
in the late spring or early summer. Nesting has been reported in both
the wet and dry seasons and it is conceivable they nest twice a year.
During this time their calling becomes more intense. The trachea is
greatly enlarged and a special resonance device has been developed.
Very little has been recorded concerning the nesting activity of
umbrellabirds, but Sick describes a nest of a loose accumulation of twigs,
some 12 metres from the ground. The clutch comprised a single egg,
oblong in shape and rather pointed at one end. It measured 56.0 x 35.8
mm. and was khaki-coloured, with light chocolate and purplish brown
spots and lightly stippled with dark brown. There was little gloss.
Indian stories indicate they lay two eggs but produce only one chick.
The skin of these birds is highly prized by local natives. We saw more
than one possessed by Indians. Interestingly, the crest of the umbrella-
bird and the hair style of many of the Indians in the area is strikingly
similar. According to Sick, " Some Jivaro Indian tribes see in
Cephalopterus the emblem of a successful warrior: the crest symbolized
the enemy's scalp. Other tribes fear the umbrellabird and believe him
to be a demon. In the domain of C. penduliger the long wattle with its
plumes is the part most appreciated. Several of these hung together are
considered the rarest and most valuable of jewels ".

Acclimatizing umbrellabirds to captivity is often difficult and may
require continual extensive hand-feeding. Their diet in the wild is not
completely known but does include various fruits and insects such as
beetles, caterpillars, grasshoppers and butterflies. The fruit appears to be
dicotyledons of various species. Cordier (personal communication)
indicates they eat small palm nuts, cherry-like fruit growing directly
on the bark of trees, berries and fruit of Cecropia. Although he did
not observe them catching insects, he is convinced they do. Fruit is
swallowed whole and the pips regurgitated later. Stomach contents of
two adult males examined contained mainly semi-digested fruits with
seeds and several elytra of Coleoptera.
Those birds in the Los Angeles Zoo are fed diced fruit (apples, oranges,
grapes, bananas, papaya and melon), \ in. meatballs composed of ground
meat, carnivore mix, geveral, mockingbird mix and ground carrot and
egg mix, \ in. balls of dog food, mice (one per bird per day), day old
chicks, mealworms, crickets, hard-boiled eggs and mynah bird pellets.
When they first arrived, several had to be force fed but soon accepted
new-born mice.
For several months, they were kept off exhibit in order to observe and
properly acclimatize them. They were then moved into an aviary
(4.5 x 5.5 x 5.5 metres) with other South American birds, mainly tanagers,
where they did well until some months later they were seen to catch and
consume small tanagers (genus Tangara). On one occasion the senior
author observed an adult male capture a house mouse ( Mus musculus)
and beat it against a perch like a kingfisher prior to swallowing it whole.
From these observations it would appear that these cotingas are quite
carnivorous. We then separated them into pairs and moved them into
three large, heavily planted aviaries with bigger birds. In the spring of
1969 one pair was moved to a large flight cage where they are thriving.
They remain aloof from other birds but appear to be compatible with
other species, if they are not too small.
Once acclimatized, they appear to be a relatively hardy species. The
New York Zoological Park records a male C. penduliger living 11 years
and a female C, glabricollis surviving 12 years. Those in the Los Angeles
Zoo are kept in unheated avairies and do not appear to be adversely
effected by cold weather. They have been active when ice formed over
their drinking pools. During extremely hot weather (in excess of 38*C)
they show signs of distress by gasping.
We have only noted one external parasite, the northern fowl mite
(Ornithonyssus sylviarum). If the bird becomes weakened, the mites
increase markedly and may be a predisposing cause of death. Mite
activity is at its peak during the warmer months. Sick reports nematodes
in the eyelids of two specimens. We have not seen this, but have noted
it in a male Equatorial cock-of-the-rock ( Rupicola peruviana aequatorilis).

Their main predator appears to be man. Based on our observations,
hunting and trapping them does not appear to be seriously affecting
the population. However, habitat destruction is being conducted at an
alarming rate and if this has not affected them yet, it probably will in the
near future.

BREEDING THE SILVER-EARED MESIA
(Leiothrix argentauris)
By Raymond Franklin (Chesham, Buckinghamshire, England)

The Silver-eared Mesia has a very large area of distribution from the
Himalayas through Nepal, India, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and
Indonesia to south-western China. It is a bird of the scrub jungle with
Rhododendron and other bushes. It is a flock bird and the nest is
described as being made of dry bamboo, leaves, grass and moss and lined
with fine plant fibre; the eggs being small and pale blue with brown
patches. Both birds share the incubation.
During August, 1970 I obtained a pair of these beautiful but rather
excitable members of the diverse family of babblers. The rest of the
year they were kept in an outside planted flight with a few Chinese
Painted Quail. They were over-wintered in my birdroom as I do not
consider it fair to expect this type of bird to put up with the English
winters. By all means give them access to an outdoor flight on fine days
but bring them into the birdroom at night.
About the beginning of March, 1971 they were put outside in a flight
15 ft. x 12 ft. with a pair of Pagoda Mynahs (Sturnus pagodarum).
Normally the Pagoda Mynahs are fairly peaceful birds so I thought they
should be fairly amicable in a large flight which contains a few small
shrubs and a nice large clump of bamboo. All appeared to be going
fairly peaceably so I hung a box 18 in. x 6 in. x 6 in. high up at an angle
for the Pagodas; they began to show interest in the box about the second
week in April, 1971 (but their married life is another story.)

Around the second week of May the Mesias commenced to build a
little nest in the middle of the bamboo clump with the exact materials
described above--I even obtained some fibre from a Borassus Palm Tree
growing in a park! In an effort to stimulate the pair to nest I obtained
ant pupae and a few live ants--which, incidentally, they used to perform
the well known " anting " mainly associated with the Sturnidae.
Copulation was observed on the 18th May and subsequently two mottled
eggs were laid by the 25th May. They soon commenced to sit and both
birds were seen to share the incubation of about two and three hours
duration during the day. The hen sat at night.
The weather for the first week of June was warmish but very windy
and I was rather apprehensive for the safety of the flimsy nest but all went
well and on the morning of the 10th June 1971--which was extremely wet
and windy--the cock was seen to dive into the bamboo with a mealworm,
so I decided to take a quick look and there was one baby. From then
on I kept away so I did not see if the others hatched off. The following
week was very wet but the adults did their duty and on the 23 rd June I
was pleased to see three fine babies clinging to a perch in the flight
(previously I had only believed there to be two eggs). The young
kept up a continual squeaking call often answered by the parents
who every evening called them to roost in the bamboo clump (not in the
nest). Live food, maggots etc. supplemented with ant pupae were
supplied but at no time did I see any pupae fed to the babies. At eighteen
days old one young died. On the 1st July the two remaining young were
seen pecking about on the ground in an attempt to feed themselves and
on the 2nd July the cock was seen displaying his red rump to the hen so I
had hopes that they might nest again. All this had been going on with the
Pagodas paying very little or no attention to them. On the morning of
the 8th July I was in the flight scattering a few mealworms when, without
any warning, the cock Pagoda swooped on the two babies and killed them.
So that brought an abrupt end to my breeding attempt for 1971 of the
Silver-eared Mesia.
I saw copulation and inspection of the old nest on the 13th July but I
did not think the hen was really in breeding condition again and she died
on the 19th July. To sum up I think there is a lesson here, and that is
if possible to keep strictly to one pair of birds to an avairy, I certainly will.
This misfortune was probably caused by not so much territory as
insufficient food, as we do know that all these birds need a terrific amount
of live food when breeding.

(Poicephalus m. meyeri)
By Dr. William S. Hawkins (Sunland, California, U.S.A.)
The Poicephalus group of parrots consists of eight main species and
some twenty subspecies, all inhabiting the Ethiopian Region which in a
broad sense includes all of Africa south of the Sahara Desert. The
various Senegal Parrots, Riippell's Parrot and Meyer's Parrot are the
representatives most commonly found in aviaries. The latter have never
been common in collections in the U.S.A., but with the changes in import
restrictions, a few of these birds are now available.
Meyer's Parrot is variously referred to as the Brown Parrot or the
Sudan Brown Parrot. Seven subspecies of this bird are recognized,
inhabiting different areas and showing very slight differences in coloration.
Differentiation would require an ornithological expert. In general, all
are called Meyer's Parrots, named in honour of Dr. Bernhard Meyer,
(1767-1836), a German dentist who contributed much to the fields of
botany and ornithology during his era. Although the bird was first
discovered by Riippell, the name, Meyer, was dedicated in recognition
of this man's work.
Broadly speaking, the Poicephalus parrots somewhat resemble larger
versions of the Lovebirds. Their range and behavior are also somewhat
similar. Meyer's Parrots are widely distributed and are partially
migratory, following food and water supplies. They are found largely in
savannah woodlands, along water-courses, and in acacia groves, but are
absent from the West African forest belt. They appear to be of a
gregarious nature.
Although not truly dimorphic, there does seem to be more sexual
differentiation than is visible in most psittacine birds. This is not as
apparent, however, as in the case of Riippell's Parrot, in which the female
is definitely more brightly colored than the male. Most authorities
state that the cock Meyer's is larger and more brightly colored than the
female, the " color " being the gold on the head and the wing butts. In
the case of the pair which I have this seems to be reversed so perhaps
this " difference " is open to question.
These birds are quiet and steady in the aviary and are said to make
excellent caged pets if hand-raised. Mine imitate a pair of Indian
Ringnecks in an adjacent aviary to perfection, but I have no knowledge
of just how proficient their ability to mimic might be. They are not
noisy or quarrelsome, either between themselves or with their aviary
neighbors. Certainly their diminutive size, beauty, and disposition
would make them an ideal " pet " bird should they ever become readily
available.

DR. W. S. HAWKINS--MEYER'S PARROT
The pair which I now keep were purchased in the late summer of
1969 as immature and newly imported birds. They were kept in an
indoor flight-cage without artificial heat until the following spring,
approximately six months, and during this sojourn they proved to be very
tractable. No undue stress was noted during this period of acclimatization.
The usual seeds were furnished with no particular attention to green food
or fruits. Although not tame, these birds never exhibited undue fright
during this confinement.
With the advent of spring the pair was placed in an outdoor aviary,
four by twenty-three feet, alone. A nest-box was provided, ten inches
square by eighteen inches deep, containing about four inches of decayed
wood. During the summer they completed their adult moult and became
much more colorful. Daily baths were provided by means of a sprinkler
system, and this they enjoyed immensely. Green food and fruit were
also provided which they were very fond of and always carried to their
drinking fountains in the fashion of many of the Asiatic parrakeets.
Late in the summer of 1970 the birds began to evince an interest in
their nest-box and in early September three eggs were laid. The hen
had made a small scrape in one corner and seemed to incubate alone
while the cock often perched on the ledge outside of the box. This
coincided with the most extreme heat in this part of Southern California
and also with my own vacation, so that the birds were not watched
carefully. All three eggs proved to be fertile, but none hatched which
came as no surprise considering the extremely high temperatures.
In 1971, near the first of February, the birds once again began to show
an interest in their nest-box. In the first week of February three eggs
were laid. By this time the birds were even steadier, but both of them
always appeared at feeding time or during any disturbance in the
aviaries. On 9th February the severe earthquake struck this immediate
area of the state, and I felt sure their project would once again be ill-fated.
This, however, was not the case. The hen did not leave the nest, and
subsequently on or about the 21st February, all three eggs hatched, two
hatchlings on the first day and the third two days later. Both parents
were extremely attentive, the cock in particular showing interest in the
activity. The same seeds were furnished, but in addition, a generous
supply of soaked oats was provided along with sweet apple, green food,
whole wheat bread, and a few peanuts every morning. These extras
were consumed eargerly with a decided lessening of interest in the regular
seed mixture.
The young birds appeared similar to infant Lovebirds with patches of
white down. They were checked once a week without causing any
apparent alarm to the parents, and the infants always seemed fat and
well fed. The smallest, however, appeared to be lagging and on the
7th May, this bird was given to a friend for hand-feeding. Its pin
feathers were well developed at this time. This bird was sucessfully

raised and developed perfectly, only to meet with disaster later on by
way of an accident. The two remaining young were successfully reared
by their parents and left the nest about three weeks later. On emergence
from the nest these youngsters, quite unlike their parents, proved to be
hysterical in confinement. Both, within twenty four hours, had broken
their necks in dashing about the flight.
In October of the same year the adults once again went to nest and
produced three fertile eggs. These hatched on the 12th November
and received the same exemplary care from both parents. However,
since the weather was becoming very chilly and it appeared that the
young would fledge during the rainy season, I decided to remove the
three of them on the 9th December. At this time they were still covered
with down and were very fat and uniform in size. Through the expertize
of Eleanor Cooley, all three were successfully hand-raised and were fully
independent by the first week in February.
The juvenile birds are smaller and duller editions of their parents,
lacking the gold markings and of a more or less uniform grey shade.
The brilliant sea-green rump patch is present, however. They are very
gentle, but even having been hand-raised are inclined to panic very
easily in strange situations. Their diet at four months of age is identical
with the parents'.
As of this writing, the 1st March 1972, the parents are once again
incubating fertile eggs, this time, four in the clutch.
Have these birds been bred before in the United States? It would be
of interest to me to find out the details if so, since they must still be
considered one of the rarer psittacines kept in captivity. I am now
inclined to attempt to breed them in a colony since their behaviour seems
so similar to that of the Lovebirds. Hybrids have been reported with
Ruppell's Parrot and are said to be very beautiful birds.
Certainly Meyer's Parrots with their many attributes deserve a firmly
established place in our avicultural endeavours.

By D. M. Holyoak and D. T. Holyoak (Weybridge, Surrey, England)
The behaviour of the eight species of the African parrot genus
Poicephalus is surprisingly little known considering the frequency with
which some of the species are kept in captivity. However, numerous
other groups of parrots are similarly little known, although the other
large genus of African parrots, the lovebirds Agapornis spp., has been
closely studied by Dilger (i960, 1964).
Poicephalus has two rather large species, the Brown-necked Parrot
P. robustus and the Red-headed Parrot P. gulielmi , and six smaller ones,
of which we were able to watch the Yellow-bellied Parrot P. senegalus ,
Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus, Brown Parrot P. meyeri, and
Riippell's Parrot P. ruppellii. All of these are confined to various parts
of Africa south of the Sahara. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1957,
1962, 1970) give details of the ranges, subspecies, food and general habits
of these species in the wild and plates illustrating them.
Observations were made on the species listed above at the London Zoo
between January 1970 and June 1971. Most of the observations were of
three P. senegalus , three P. cryptoxanthus , two males of P. meyeri and two
P. gulielmi, a few on singles of P. robustus and P. ruppellii. These birds
were housed indoors in large all-wire cages.
None of the birds bred during the period of observation and it was not
possible to be sure of the sex of several individuals. Because of this we
were unable to judge the function of many behaviour patterns and may
not have seen the full repertoire of display from any of the species.
Nevertheless it seems worthwhile publishing the information we have
recorded as we are unable to make further regular observations and it may
be of value in comparative behaviour studies and in encouraging further
investigation. The behaviour patterns are compared throughout this
paper with those of lovebirds, which have been described in detail by
Dilger. Dilger's terminology of displays is followed.

These include behaviour concerned with maintenance of plumage, soft
parts and skin; some of the motor patterns used in these behaviour patterns
appear to have been the precursors of ritualized agonistic and epigamic
displays.
Bathing was only seen once, from P. senegalus, although splashes around
the water dishes in the cages suggested it was fairly frequently performed.
The bird seen to bathe stood on the rim of a water dish and ducked its
head into the water several times, then repeatedly jumped into the water
with outstretched wings and tail and quickly jumped out again. After

entering the water several times it flew to a perch, preened lightly and
then rested. Lovebirds also bathe by quickly entering and leaving the
water (Dilger i960, 1964) but hanging parrots Loriculus spp. stand in the
water for longer periods (Buckley 1968).
Head-scratching was performed directly (foot under the wing) in all
of the species studied, as previously recorded by Brereton and Immelmann
(I9 6 2).
Stretching movements were similar to those recorded in Loriculus and
Agapornis. The commonest movements were stretching of one leg with
the ipsilateral wing and half of tail, followed by the same on the other
side of the body, stretching both wings upwards over the back, and
various plumage fluffing and sleeking movements.
Preening and oiling were similar to these actions in Agapornis and
Loriculus.
Drinking is performed in the same way as in Agapornis in all species
watched, by dipping the bill into the water and sucking it up, without
throwing the head back as some other parrots and most non-psittacines
do.
Feeding. The birds studied were fed on a diet of mixed small seeds
most of which were picked up in the bill, husked and swallowed without
use of the feet. Larger food items were picked up in a foot or in the
bill and transferred to a foot, then held up in the foot while being chewed.
When fed with long strips of carrot none of the six species held it down
with the foot as Budgerigars Melopsittacus undulatus and grass parakeets
Neophema spp. were seen to do. None of the species was seen to scratch
in the ground litter with a foot as seen in Psittacula and Cyanoramphus
s p P-
Bill-wiping was frequently performed with a side to side stropping
motion on perches after feeding. The bill was also scratched with
movements similar to those used in head-scratching. The legs and feet
were frequently nibbled gently with the bill tip using a similar action to
that often used when preening.
Agonistic displays and Fighting Behaviour
Threat displays and fighting behaviour are highly ritualized in
Poicephalus so that harmful fighting is rare or absent. The posturings used
are similar to those in Agapornis , but with differences in intensity and
degree.
Wing-threat displays are commonly used. At low intensity the carpal
joints are held out from the body exposing bright patches of colour on the
inside of the carpal joint (Fig. iA). With increasing aggression the
carpal joints are first flicked or shivered and at high intensity the whole
wings are held vertically over the back (Fig. iB, iC, iD). Carpal holding
as described was seen in gulielmi, cryptoxanthus , senegalus and ruppellii;
carpal-flicking or shivering in the same four species, and wing-holding in

cryptoxanthus, gulielmi (less ritualized than in cryptoxanthus , without
accompanying calls), senegalus (highly ritualized and accompanied by
calls), meyeri (only seen a few times, probably not highly ritualized in
this species), and ruppellii (seen to flap partly opened wings, but not to
wing-hold in same way as other species). These displays expose brightly
coloured plumage on the carpal joint and wing-linings, yellow in cryptoxan-
thus, meyeri, senegalus and ruppellii , red in gulielmi. The bright patches
of plumage in the other species of the genus suggest they have similar
displays.
Calls used in agonistic display include sharp, repeated clicking notes
in gulielmi and senegalus. At first we thought these notes were produced
mechanically by bill-clicking, but later we saw a gulielmi giving them
with food in its bill so they must be vocally produced. P. cryptoxanthus
gives loud squeaks and a repeated swi swi call while giving carpals-held
and carpal-flicking displays and loud squeaks while wing-holding. P.
senegalus was heard to give repeated loud, shrill squeaks as the usual
accompaniment to wing-holding and sometimes a low, throaty grating
call with this display.
Lunging and gaping movements were frequently directed at birds that
approached too close to the performing individual. Gaping in threat
was seen in gulielmi, senegalus, cryptoxanthus and meyeri (Fig. 2A) and
lunging was seen in gulielmi and senegalus (Fig.2B). Gaping always
accompanied lunging.
Aggressive-walking towards an opponent resembling the rushing display
of Loriculus and Agapornis was seen at high intensity in gulielmi and
ruppellii and at low intensity in cryptoxanthus, meyeri and senegalus
(Fig. 2C). In this display a bird walks towards another with lowered
head and sleeked plumage and long pacing strides.
Striking with the feet which is commonly used in threat and fighting by
Budgerigars (Brockway 1964 a) and some other parrots was never seen.
Forward threat postures , merging with aggressive walking or lunging
and gaping, were seen to be used by all six species (Fig. 2D); the bright
red forehead feathers of gulielmi and the yellow forehead of some forms of
meyeri are made prominently visible in this display.
Upright threat postures were infrequently seen, except in gulielmi, where
the red forehead patch is made conspicuously visible (Fig. 2E). P.
gulielmi usually used these displays when threatened but unwilling to
retreat.
Fighting behaviour was seen a few times in cryptoxanthus and gulielmi,
but fighting was infrequent. The aim in fighting was mainly to peck the
bill of the opponent as in Agapornis ; this highly ritualized fighting ensures
that little physical damage is likely to be caused to the participants in a
fight. Occasional pecks were directed at the opponents wings or rump,
but it was quite apparent that pecking was aimed mainly at the bill as

opportunities to peck at other parts of the opponents body were usually
ignored.
Submission to aggressive display is indicated by the threatened bird
either fluffing its plumage, turning away, retreating, or various combina-
tions of these.
The various wing-threat displays seem likely to have evolved from
movements of flying towards the opponent, whilst lunging, gaping and
aggressive walking are ritualized movements of walking towards or pecking
towards the opponent.

Epigamic Displays
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996171875" page_id="56367288"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
Various displays similar to those used in sexual displays by Loriculus
and Agapornis were seen. As breeding and copulation were not seen in
this study it was impossible to be sure of the exact context in which these
displays are usually performed.
Switch-sidling displays were seen to be performed by gulielmi,
cryptoxanthus and meyeri. P. meyeri was seen to give a highly-ritualized
switch-sidling display in which a male bird made sudden complete spins
around on the perch as it ran backwards and forwards giving short twitters,
whistles and a repeated loud nasal twar call, with carpal joints held out
from the body and occasionally shivered (Fig. 3A). This display was
performed rapidly for several minutes at a time, with a mechanical
clockwork motion. P. gulielmi gave a less ritualized display, without calls,
but with occasional deep bowing movements which were not present in
the displays of meyeri (Fig. 3B).
P. cryptoxanthus gave a similar display to that of gulielmi , but lacking the
bowing movements which were reduced to a slight head-dipping action,
and giving squeaking calls.
Foot-lifting displays similar to those of some lovebirds were seen to
be used by cryptoxanthus. In this display a bird sidling close to another
lifts one foot as if about to head-scratch and then either lowers it again (Fig.
3C), or head-scratches, the foot nearest the other bird being lifted most
often. This display may have originated from head-scratching used as a
displacement activity or from the movements of stepping on to the mates
back prior to copulation.
Wing-displays similar to those used in agonistic display (carpal-holding
and carpal flicking and shivering) were often used by birds that did not
appear to be threatening another or by birds with apparently ambivalent
motivation, so as these displays form one component of the epigamic
switch-sidling display, they seem likely to function in sexual as well as
agonistic signalling.
Allopreening was seen in senegalus , cryptoxanthus , meyeri and ruppellii.
Each time one sleeked bird was seen nibbling the head or neck feathers

of another which was more fluffed. Individuals of P. cryptoxanthus were
seen to allopreen individuals of P. senegalus in the same cage and vice
versa.
Head-bobbing was seen to be performed by gulielmi , cryptoxanthus and
senegalus. The head is raised and lowered with a quick bobbing movement
similar to that used when regurgitating food prior to courtship feeding,
but no food is produced (Fig. 3D).
Courtship-feeding was seen in gulielmi , cryptoxanthus and senegalus , but
often the movements of courtship feeding were seen without food being
passed from one bird to the other. The movements of courtship feeding
were similar to those used in the Budgerigar (Brockway 1964 b; Fig. 3E).
Changes in pupil-size accompanied many displays, but we noticed this
too late to make any detailed observations.

By J. Delacour (Cleres, France)
In these days of astonishing and disorderly proliferation of zoos and
bird parks throughout the world, it is a rare pleasure to discover a really
good one. But it is just what has happened to me and to my friends,
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Jourde, when we stopped at the small town of Villars-
les-Dombes on the 5th June 1971.
It is not that this new bird park was unknown to me. Three or four
years ago, I received at Cleres a group of leaders of the Department
(County) de l'Ain, which is situated in the east of France, north of Lyon
and west of Geneva. The district of La Dombes extends west to the
Rhone river, north to Bourg-en-Bresse, east to Amberieux and Perouges
(an extraordinarily well and completely preserved medieval town) and
south to a few miles north of Lyon.
It is one of the largest " wetland " in Western Europe. The fairly flat
country over 40 miles wide covers 11.000 hectares; it is dotted with
inumerable lakes, the home of large populations of wild ducks, herons,
small waders and other water birds. The County authorities were well
aware of its great importance for wildlife, and they had decided to set up
a " Parc-Reserve They not only wanted to organise a refuge for
breeding and migrating waterfowl, but also to show the public, in a well
planned and kept park, the 200 local species as well as a number of exotic
ones. They intended to interest all classes of people in bird life, local
as well as tourists, by showing the birds under as near as possible natural
conditions and so to contribute to their conservation.
The delegation that came to Cleres included the Deputy Prefect, the
President of the County Council, M. Saint-Cyr, a veterinarian and a
keen animal lover, M. Faure, the director of Public Works, another
nature enthusiast. Dr. Ciarpaglini and I, also in Paris Prof. J. Nouvel,
Director of the zoos, and his assistants, tried to help them in all possible
ways in the planning of their park. A great deal of skill, time and money
was spent on the project and the bird park was opened on 18th July 1970.
I was unfortunately unable to attend which I much regretted. The
curator, a former assistant of the Paris Zoo, M. Bernard Liauzu, was well
known to me; I realised that he was a capable technician and, working
under M. Faure's directives, he was likely to organise and to keep the park
well. But one never knows, and previous disillusions in different
countries, when I had seen for the first time the results of well intended
good advice, have made me suspicious. My wariness, this time, proved
quite unnecessary. The Parc Ornithologique de la Dombes is a success,
and no doubt one of the best of its kind in the world.
It consists mainly of a long lake (Etang Grand Turlet) with smaller ones
at both ends. The landscape is typical of a marsh, with comparatively few

trees, mostly poplars and willows. Many others, however, have been
planted and are growing well; they will add much to the charm of the
grounds as time goes on. All around the lake is a walk, and at the sides,
away from the lake, are groups of aviaries and enclosures for various kinds
of birds, all elaborately built and planted and very attractive. Near the
entrance is an excellent birdhouse, with large, planted indoor flights,
luxuriously finished and fitted, which compares favourably with the
average bird house of large, modern zoos. A very attractive bar-restaurant,
in the shape of a rotonda, with a wonderful view of the lake, stands
near-by. The adjoining plan shows what the park is like better than a
more detailed description.
The collection is extensive and consists of all sorts of birds from
Ostriches to Sunbirds and Hummingbirds. The accommodation is
roomy, well built and well kept. Good breeding results were already
achieved in 1970 as the following list shows:
Native Birds reared: Mute Swans, Pintails, Red-crested Pochards
(they also breed wild locally), Shelducks, Teal, Pochards, White-eyes
(also a rare local breeder), Shovelers, Gadwalls, Greenfinches and
Yellowhammers. (A total of 127 birds).
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.891657166666667" page_id="56367293"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Foreign Birds reared: Bronze-winged, Galapagos, Senegal, and
Abyssinian Black-billed Doves; Golden, Swinhoe's and Reeves's
Pheasants; Red Junglefowl, Peafowl; California, Chinese Painted and
Coromandel Quails; Tasmanian Waterhen. Egyptian Geese; Paradise
Sheldrake; Carolina, Mandarin, Koloa Ducks; Chiloe Wigeon; Chilian
Pintail; Indian spotbilled, Philippine, Pacific grey and Rosybilled Ducks;
Fulvous Tree Ducks, Chestnut and Marbled Teal (Total 334 birds).
In addition 21 birds were reared by the parents in the free state--
Tufted Duck, Gadwall, Garganey, White-eyed Duck and Red Jungle fowl.
25 local breeding birds were hand-reared: Long-eared, Brown and Little
Owls, Black Kite, Kestrel, Montagu's Harrier, Purple Heron, Night
Heron, Little Tern, Grey Wagtail and Oriole.

There is no doubt that even better results will be obtained in the
future when the birds have settled down completely.
The following wild species have nested in the park in 1970; Mallard,
Gadwall, Red-crested Pochard, Tufted Duck, Coot, Moorhen, Kestrel
several Reed and other warblers, Stonechat, Black Redstart, Great Tit,
Martin, Starling, Tree Sparrow, Greenfinch, Goldfinch, Reed Bunting
and many others outside the Park.
Among the most interesting displays are those of the bird houses where
many species of Toucan's, Touracous, Tanagers, Barbets, Woodpecker,
Jays, Starlings and seedeaters, as well as a few Sunbirds and Hummingbirds
are well exhibited.
Several large outdoor aviaries are well worth mentioning: one with a
big collection of Plovers, Sandpipers, Terns, Avocets, Stilts etc., others
with native hawks, eagles and owls. Vultures are kept wing-clipped

in large areas with many leaning dead trees. Pheasant pens, also containing
doves, house an excellent collection of birds. A pretty good sized pond
is stocked with different Flamingoes and some of the rarer ducks.
Quite remarkable is the Pelicans lake of three acres under almost natural
conditions; a nearby marshy enclosure is inhabited by many species
of Ibises, Storks, Herons, a few ducks and Geese (Redbreasts, Radjahs,
Ross) Ostriches, Rheas, Emus, Cassowaries, jabiru and Marabou
Storks, and several species of Cranes live in large, grassy and bushy
enclosures while Crown, Stanley, and Demoiselle Cranes, Peafowl and
Red Junglefowl roam freely throughout the Park. On the lake are
Coscoroba, Black, and Whooper Swans, Chinese (wild) Emperor,
Snow and Lesser White-fronted geese and many ducks. It requires a
large number of waterfowl to show at all on a 20 acre lake! On the north
side of the lake, between the shore and two long islands, some twenty pens
have been built to house the pairs of swans and geese which have to be
isolated. Some Crested Grebes are also to be seen here. Hidden away are
very good buildings stores, kitchens, winter shelters, laboratories, hospital,
etc. (Bel Air.)
In conclusion, I wish to say that a visit to the Parc Ornithologique
de la Dombes is well worthwhile and any of our members travelling in
Eastern France and Switzerland will find it rewarding to stop for a few
hours at this very well-built, stocked and kept bird park.

The Palm Cockatoo is unique among parrots in having two flat
projecting areas of rhamphotheca on the inside of the upper mandible,
forming three step-like levels. A number of other large parrots have two
similar steps. While watching a Palm Cockatoo at the London Zoo I
noticed that it used the large innermost " step " when mandibulating
small food items (Fig. A) and the middle " step " with larger ones
(Fig- B).
On a later visit to the Zoo I fed this bird with an assortment of seeds
of different sizes and made notes on the way they were treated. Twenty
hazel nuts of average diameter about 10 mm were all husked and crushed
while being held in the middle " step ', as were three walnuts of about
25 mm diameter. Twenty sunflower seeds 2-3 mm thick were all husked
on the innermost " step " as were assorted apple and orange pips of slightly

smaller size. The outermost " step " appears to be used only for tearing
at large fruits and not for husking seeds or nuts.
The " stepped " inside of the lower mandible probably enables Palm
Cockatoos to feed efficiently on both large and small seeds, whereas
a bill of this size without " steps " would probably be inefficient when
dealing with small seeds.

Some of the most beautiful and isolated tropical islands in the world,
the Seychelles are strewn like diamonds across the blue seas of the central
Western Indian Ocean 1,000 miles from the coast of East Africa. They
are unique in many ways. The main group consists of 32 granitic
islands scattered around the central and largest island, Mahe. They
are thought to be the mountain peaks of a subterranean continent. Strewn
everywhere are gigantic granite boulders worn smooth and sculptured
by the action of the sea and the winds. Great slabs of granite stare out
of the mountain slopes and thick vegetation grows profusely wherever the
granite gives way to soil.
Apart from the geological aspect the islands are rich in plant and animal
rarities. There can be few places on earth that can boast of eight or nine
of the world's rarest birds. The fact that the Seychelles can do so is
not necessarily to its credit. The islands have been inhabited by man for
only 200 years and during this period almost all of the endemic forests
have been wiped out, (the trees yielded fine timber that was heavily
exported) together with practically the total populations of birds and
reptiles (giant tortoises and crocodiles.) The crocodiles were killed off
shortly after the first settlers appeared. Apart from the direct slaughter
of birds by man and the rapid destruction of their habitats, the bird
populations further suffered from the introduction of cats to the islands
and the now ubiquitous Indian Mynahs (Acridotheres tristis) and much
later, in 1950, the Barn Owl, which was introduced to control the rats
(also introduced). It soon, however, found that other birds were far
tastier than rats. The conclusions are obvious.
Because a bird is classified rare does not necessarily mean that it is
especially attractive. In fact in the Seychelles many of the rare species
are remarkably nondescript. One of the exceptions, although not
particularly rare, is the Fairy Tern which nests on Cousin Island and is
quite the most delicately beautiful bird I have ever seen. All of these
birds, however, are extremely interesting.
La Digue island several miles from Mahe is the last stronghold of the
attractive Veuve or Paradise Flycatcher (it was once plentiful on several
of the other islands). There are reputed to be less than 50 of these birds
left on La Digue and these represent the last population of Seychelles
Paradise Flycatcher in the world. A guide took me to where a pair were
nesting. After a short trek through coconut palms along a track worn
down by bare feet, the guide stopped abruptly beneath a Takamaka
tree. Following his gaze I looked up to see, four feet above my head on
a thin branch, a small compact nest about three inches in diameter. It
was woven delicately with plant fibres and small wads of wild cotton. In

the vain hope of actually seeing one of the birds I started to position
myself some distance from the nest lest I frighten them off. The guide,
however, assured me that there was no need to move. Unbelievably I
stood and waited. Sure enough in a matter of minutes a female Paradise
Flycatcher appeared. She flew directly to her nest and settled herself
down quite oblivious to our presence. 1 could almost have reached up
and touched the nest. The female, about the size of a canary, has the
whole of her neck and throat coloured a metallic steel blue. The underparts
of her body are white, the upperparts brown. Three minutes later the
male appeared, resplendent in the typical long sweeping tail of the
flycatcher. He came dipping in with much chirping and hullabaloo due
to the presence of a Sunbird in the nesting tree which had overstepped
its territory. These flycatchers are very territorial and the male became
extremely aggressive to the poor sunbird, driving it off with a lot of noise
and mock attacks. The female, aroused by all this activity, promptly
left her nest to join in the persecution. I was led to another nest about
a hundred yards distant where a pair of flycatchers were in the process of
constructing a nest. This was perched precariously on a low branch
only fifteen yards from a native house. After a wait of half an hour the
female arrived and began working on her nest. The Paradise Flycatcher
breeds just before the rains from October until March. The female does
most of the incubation but both parents share the duty of feeding the
young. My guide told me that only one egg was laid (Philippe Loustau-
lalanne in Land Birds of the Granitic Islands maintains that the clutch
numbers three eggs). Confusion also exists concerning the incubation
period. It has been stated as being both 12 days and one month.
Obviously more work needs to be done.
The Seychelles Black Parrot (Coracopsis barklyi ) is confined to Praslin,
the second largest island in the group. It nests only in the coco-de-mer
forest in the centre of the island but can be seen over a much wider area.
It is the size of a starling. The plumage on the upper parts of the body
is sooty-brown, becoming lighter on the underparts, the same colour as
the beak. This bird is extremely rare. It is not known for certain how
many there are left, but estimates in the region of 60 birds have been
given. Although this bird feeds mainly on berries and fruits outside of
the Vallee-de-Mai, it nests only in the Vallee among the huge fronds of the
coco-de-mer, some of which are 15 ft. in diameter. Such a symbiotic
relationship between a bird and its specialized environment must be
unique. Since the parrot is found nowhere else but in the vicinity of
these palms it is quite fair to assume that should its habitat be destroyed,
by fire for instance, which has been a common occurrence on some of the
other islands, then the Black Parrot, so highly specialized, will be unable
to adapt to a new environment and will cease to exist. Confirmation of
this inability to adapt was given by the Director of the Botanic Gardens in
Mahe who told me that they had attempted to keep some Black Parrots in

an aviary in the gardens. Although the climate is identical of course to
that on Praslin, and the fruits provided for them the same as they would
find in and around the Vallee-de-Mai, none of the birds survived. This
I believe was attempted on several occasions. Very little is known about
the nesting habits of these birds but the clutch is said to contain at least
two eggs and both parents are believed to take part in feeding the young.
On the small sixty acre island of Cousin two miles from Praslin lives a
little warbler known by the attractive local name of Petit Merle des lies or
Seychelles Brush Warbler (Bebrornis seychellensis). This small olive-green
bird is the least striking of all the birds on the island which include the
beautiful Fairy Tern, Tropic Birds and both Noddy and Sooty Terns.
It is, however, one of the rarest birds in the world. There is no evidence
to suggest that it ever inhabited any other island but Cousin--the short
stretches of water between them being an insurmountable barrier for a
bird with such a short fluttering flight. They were easy to observe since
they had no fear of man and I noticed many youngsters sitting in the low
branches frantically trying to attract the attention of their parents by
beating their fluffy little wings rapidly. The breeding season proper
lasts from October to March although David Lloyd, the present Scientific
Administrator of the island, told me that he has seen them nesting at all
times of the year. The nest itself is similar to that of the Paradise Fly-
catcher and is built of dry grass and strips of coconut fronds. It is placed
in the fork of a low branch in bushes about six feet from the ground, fre-
quently in a patch of mangroves. The clutch consists of whitish-coloured
eggs spotted with brown. It is an entirely insectivorous bird, caterpillars
and insects forming its diet.
Also found on Cousin as well as on Cousine, Marianne and Felicite
islands is the very rare Seychelles Turtle Dove (Streptopelia rostrata).
Both sexes are alike. The head and neck are a deep red as far as the chest
and underparts where it becomes lighter. The back and wings are
brown whilst the abdomen and underparts of the tail are greyish-white.
The tail feathers are broadly banded and a pattern of small black spots
is evident on either side of the neck. Unfortunately the true endemic
species is becoming exceedingly scarce due to interbreeding with introduced
sub-species. The breeding season begins in late October and continues
until March. In common with all doves the courting display is a panto-
mime of cooing and bowing followed by the female inserting her beak
into the male's, more head bobbing and finally mounting. The nest is a
small platform of dry twigs and roots placed in a low tree or bush about
ten feet from the ground. The male, like all good husbands, collects
the building material and hands it to the female who places it in position
on the nest. Nest-building, which seems to take place only in the mornings,
lasts for about eight days. The clutch consists of two white eggs laid
at 48 hour intervals, and incubation lasts for eighteen days. The chicks
are fed by regurgitation and leave the nest four weeks after hatching.

Food of these birds consists of the seeds of local plants such as the Castor
Oil plant and the Herbe Sergent.
Another endemic columbidae is the Dutch Pigeon ( Alectroenas
pulcherrima ) which is fortunately fairly well distributed over several
of the islands in the granitic group including Mahe. It has a much
more complex courtship display than the Turtle Dove, far too detailed
to go into here. The site for the nest is chosen by the mated pair to-
gether, after searching numerous forked branches. When the chosen site
has been established the male flies off to gather nesting material with
which the female constructs her platform. During the incubation
period which lasts for eighteen days and is shared by the male, the male
sleeps by the nest at night, even after the chicks have hatched. This
pigeon feeds on fruits of such trees as Cinnamon, Wild Fig, Guava,
Bois de Pomme, and is especially partial to the flowers of the Rubber Tree.
It is generally found in flocks of up to about fifty and seems to confine
itself to the forests. In general appearance this bird is blue-black in
colour with the neck, upper back and breast a pale grey.
There are two endemic birds of prey on the islands. One is a small
Kestrel known as Katiti (Falco area). It is fairly common on Mahe and
some of the other islands, inhabiting the rugged mountain slopes. It
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.914803" page_id="56367301"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
is also said to live in Churches and buildings around Victoria, the capital
of Mahe. The only ones I saw were sitting forlornly in their cages in
the Botanic Gardens. They are striking little birds measuring about
9 in. in length and are grey-brown in colour. Both sexes are identical.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9927031" page_id="56367301"  page_num="104" year="" vol="">
The breeding season is usually from November to March although they
have been noted as breeding as early as September. One to two white
eggs spotted with brown are laid in rock crevices on the mountain side,
even on the top of bare walls. The incubation period is not known. The
Katiti feeds mainly on lizards striking them down at a tremendous speed
with its talons in the typical hawklike manner.
Much rarer and until recently thought to be extinct is the Bare-legged
Scops Owl ( Gymnoscops insularis) which is about the same size as the
English Little Owl. The general colour is russet-brown with black
streaks. It is known to live in the mountains above Ans aux Pins on
Mahe. Unfortunately very little additional information is available and
total numbers are as yet unknown, but quite obviously very few of them
exist. Perhaps the plight of this small owl has something to do with the
introduction, around 1950, of the African Barn Owl that has since spread
to most of the outlying islands and is proving a serious threat to many of
the endemic birds.
In 1906 the small attractive Seychelles White Eye (Zosterops modestus)
was reported as being plentiful on Mahe. However, since 1936 there
had been no record of its existance, at least not until very recently when
a small flock was discovered at La Misere, Mahe. Virtually nothing is

known about this extremely rare bird at present, only that it feeds on tiny
insects and nectar.
Another bird that can share the title as one of the world's rarest birds
is the Pie Chanteuse or Seychelles Magpie Robin (Copsychus sechellarum)
of which there is reported to be one specimen on Alphonse island and
approximately 30 on Fregate. This outstrips both the Black Parrot and
the Seychelles Brush Warbler for rarity. The Magpie Robin is about the
same size as a starling. Both sexes are metallic steel-blue in colour with
white wing coverts. The tail is normally carried high over the back and is
frequently lowered and jerked up again. The Magpie Robin appears to
spend the hottest part of the day in the shade of trees emerging only in
the cool of morning and evening. Its courtship display is interesting.
It consists of the birds hopping to and fro on the ground as if searching
for food. While doing this they closely watch each other. Finally
one bird flies toward the other with its beak and neck held pointing up
in the air. The wings are drooped, tail depressed and slightly fanned.
In this position the male then lets out a low screech rocking its head from
side to side. The female, by this time in the tree, has fluffed herself up
into a ball, and makes short runs along the branch in front of her mate
who eventually follows suit but does not puff up his feathers and retains
his perpendicular posture of false indifference. The nest consists of
strips of coconut leaf and small dry roots as well as feathers and any bits
of likely material they can find. The clutch is said to consist of two
white eggs, but no definite information is available regarding the incubation
period. Food consists of insects and even lizards, which abound on the
islands.
There are more birds on these granitic islands but almost all of them
have been introduced, and to the casual observer they are noticably
devoid of any wildlife, with the exception of course of the ubiquitious
Indian Mynahs. The outer islands, however, which are non-granitic,
such as Bird Island, the Amaranties and the Aldabra group which I did
not visit are incredibly rich in sea birds. It is heartening to know that
many of the Seychelles islands are now nature reserves.

A very rare event is the hatching and raising in our Zoo of a Long-crested
Eagle ( Lophoaetus occipitalis ). Two eggs were laid at the beginning of
January. One egg was left with the parents, the other one was put in an
incubator. After an incubation period of 40 days, the two young hatched.
Unfortunately the one we had left with the parents was found dead a
few days later. The other one developed extremely well under the care
of the keeper who has already raised Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus)
and Andean Condors ( Vultur gryphus) several times. It is unknown to
us whether there has been any breeding success with these rare African
birds of prey in other zoos and naturally we are very pleased with the
unexpected event.
As in the past years the fine breeding pair of European Eagle-Owls
(Bubo bubo) again pleased us with three grey and white " Easter chicks "
which were hatched on nth, 12th and 13th March. Now they have
grown so much that they no longer fit under the feathers of their mother.
Their appetite is very remarkable. Whereas they had been nursed by
their parents during the first days, they now gulp down each its own
portion of mice. These young will be given to a German Wildlife
Preservation organization and from there set free in the Harz, Bayrischer
Wald, or other suitable areas of the Federal Republic of Germany.
In addition to these remarkable breeding successes so very early in the
season, two Cape Barren Geese ( Cereopsis novaehollandiae) and one

In a letter to the Editor of " Cage and Aviary Birds " W. A. Pope of
Exeter reports the successful breeding of the White-headed Nun
(Lonchura maja). Three young were reared in 1970 in a small planted
aviary which was also occupied by various Waxbills. A compact nest of
dried grasses was constructed in a half-open box, and four eggs were laid
which hatched fourteen days later. The young were fed by the parents
(which ignored live food) on soaked millet and seeding grasses. They
left the nest when they were nineteen days old but continued to be fed
by the cock for almost another six weeks. They were light brown all over
and did not attain adult plumage until they were twelve months old.

Although the female has laid as many as fifteen eggs a year none hatched
until January of this year. The chick is being reared by its parents on
sunflower seed, corn on the cob, grapes, carrots and bread treated with a
multi-vitamin preparation. At 37 days the chick showed the first signs
of being a cock by a trace of green emerging feathers.

Our old hen Eclectus Parrot which had been with us for ten years has
just died to my sorrow as she was a great pet--too much so because she
refused to mate with the cock she lived with and all her eggs were in-
fertile. Our Peacock-Pheasants started laying in the middle of February
as usual and we have already collected second clutches. They lay
almost exactly once a fortnight if you take away the eggs. The Carolina
Ducks are all round the bungalow where we live, inspecting barrels in the
trees. We tried two pairs of Roseate Cockatoos in one aviary in the hope
that they would breed but not a bit of it. Within three days they were
fighting. The mild winter has been kind to us birdwise, but I think there
is more disease about in that sort of weather than in colder, drier conditions.
We have had the big lake empty for over six weeks trying to get rid of
some of the silted up mud. It has been an awful job for a lake surrounded
by trees is not the easiest place to get at with machinery. However, the
water is back in now but the bank looks a mess. We have tried to create
a boggy part where the Flamingos can breed."

The first part of the book is devoted to general subjects essential to
bird study such as palaeontology, anatomy, plumage and moult, senses
and behaviour, voice and sound production, including a review of bird
song studies, distribution, migration, flight, food and feeding habits,
breeding behaviour, social relations, taxonomy and nomenclature. A
final chapter on the classification of birds around the world contains
descriptions in detail of representatives of each of the recognised 168
bird families.
At the end of each chapter there is a useful list of references which will
enable the reader to consult the literature on the subject. The numerous
figures help to explain the various anatomical features of birds, in addition
to examples of each bird family. Finally there is a complete glossary up
to date of ornithological terms.
We have no hesitation in recommending this work to anyone wishing
to acquire a knowledge of fundamental ornithology.

THE SWANS. By Peter Scott and the Wildfowl Trust. London:
Michael Joseph, 1972. Price #4.20.
The beauty, grace and romantic mystery of these magnificent birds
has attracted both writers and artists since the earliest times but this
beautiful book is the first to deal comprehensively and scientifically with
all the eight species of swans. Appropriately enough it is a combination
of the work of artists and scientists, for Peter Scott has painted the
frontispiece and drawn many of the line illustrations and in addition
Philippa Scott and Ted Jackson are responsible for many of the 48 black
and white plates, together with some of the world's best wildfowl
photographers. The text, divided into nine chapters, is by Peter Scott,
who writes the introduction, and members of the Wildfowl Trust. The
description of the species is by Hugh Boyd, followed by their distribution,
migration and numbers by Malcolm Ogilvie. The habitat and food is
described by Myrfyn Owen and Janet Kear; and Janet Kear also writes
an account of reproduction and family life. John Beer and Malcolm
Ogilvie write on disease and death; Andrew Dawnay on swans and man;
Mary Evans and Andrew Dawnay on swans in art, heraldry and myth;
and Geoffrey Matthews on their conservation. The whole is under the
general editorship of George Atkinson-Willes.
There are a number of appendices including tables giving the weights
and measurements of swans, clutch size and longevity, and also lists of
recorded foods; and finally a comprehensive list of references.
We have nothing but admiration for this beautiful work but hope that
in future editions it might be possible to include at least one example of the
swan in dramatic art, following those in pictorial art.

RED-HEADED AND BLACK-HEADED BUNTINGS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997121959183673" page_id="56367308"  page_num="111" year="" vol="">
There are some frightful old wives' tales in the world of aviculture, many of
which have become cliches that are absolutely mandatory to some writers. Such
reference to the literature that exists seems to be restricted to Alec Brooksbank's
" Foreign Birds for Garden Aviaries " or last week's " Cage &amp; Aviary Birds
Perhaps the most celebrated example is that of the well-known alleged fertile
hybrid, the Bengalese. Only last year we were told in " Birds of the World " that
the African Silverbill, Indian Silverbill, and the Pearl-headed Silverbill are all the
same species--an extension of the erroneous belief that the African and Indian
birds are conspecific. Indeed, the glee with which old saws like the Pekin Robin
is not a robin and has no red breast, the Lazuli Bunting is Chaffinch-like (which it
scarcely is), the Red-headed Bunting is not red-headed, etc. are trotted out, rarely
serve any purpose other than to undermine the credibility of the writer. The
cliches seem to me to be repeated parrot fashion, without thought, and at times
can even be misleading and hence dangerous.
Forgive my intemperate rant, please. It all began when I bought a Black-
headed Bunting recently. The Red-headed I have owned on several occasions,
but the Black-headed I am much less familiar with. I picked it out in a local pet
shop from one of those ridiculous tall narrow cylindrical cages that seem to be
designed with some abstract sense of modem decor design in mind. Should any
species of bird ever be discovered that is only 2 in. long and can fly vertically, I
imagine this cage would be ideal; until then, I recommend it for indoor plants only.
The bunting was so covered with droppings from the birds on the perches above
it that its primaries and tail feathers looked like black and white cheese straws, and
it was quite incapable of flight. Furthermore, its back and rump were plucked
quite naked. Despite this misfortune, the hapless creature was physically quite
strong and was muy gordo, had a nice fat breast.
Following a very careful bath with my wife's most expensive toilet soap, and
some care, the bird is now in excellent condition and singing freely. As I have
watched him and studied him, I have also read the accounts of the species in the
various books and journals that I have. Time and again I have come across the
same old cliche (with never any reference given) that some/many ornithologists
consider the Black-headed Bunting to be conspecific with the Red-headed. Only
one entry hints at the reason which appears to be because where the breeding
range of the two birds overlaps a little, some hybridisation has been known to occur.
This, of course, must be studied closely, but on the face of it that seems to me
to be a bit shaky as a criteria on which to base such a sweeping statement. Indeed,
following this as sole criteria, one could blithely sweep dozens of species off the
books tomorrow, and wreak havoc in certain fields.
It is my own opinion that Black-headed and Red-headed Buntings are perfectly
valid species but I intend to do some careful study of them using as a model the
case history of the African and Indian Silverbill differentiation done by Dr.
Harrison (those interested please refer to Ibis, 106 (1964) : 462-468). Meanwhile,
however, I would be most interested to hear from anybody who has kept both
sexes of both species, particularly if they were in the owner's possession at the
same time. I for one would like to know the truth and the answer might well have
some application to modern ornithology or aviculture. In any event, though I
doubt if the cliche will die, they are part of the folklore and the entrenched old
conservatives wouldn't have it any other way, I'm sure.

SEXING PARROTS AND THE USE OF THE FOOT BY PARROTS WHEN
FEEDING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997403666666666" page_id="56367309"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
I wrote my article on the use of the foot made by feeding parrots (Avicultural
Magazine 1971 (77) pp. 93-100)--and simultaneously became interested in
Caiques--as a consequence of, somewhat belatedly, reading a paper on " Head
Scratching in the Psittaciformes " (Brereton &amp; Immelmann 1962 Ibis (104) pp.
169-175). This contains some doubtful statements. One of which was to say
that " the Loriniinae never hold food in the foot "--p. 174--and another which
said that Caiques Pionites have few affinities with most South American Parrots
--p. 172. Lories and Lorikeets do, of course, use the feet as hands. And Caiques
are closely related to Conures (which is what Thompson--Brereton &amp; Immelmann's
reference--wrote, and they misinterpreted).
Most of the evidence for my paper came from personal observation. Recognising
that birds are individuals I tried to see as many of each species as I could. Where
my number was limited, or absent, then I wrote to aviculturalists whom I thought
might be able to help. The Geoffroy's parrot Geoffroyus geoffroyi, and the
Pesquet's are individual birds owned by Mr. John Wilson, of Norwich. His
Geoffroy's parrot was seen to make an almost continual use of the foot as a hand
when eating peanuts and apple. My observations of Keas came from a pair of
captive birds at Bourton-on-the-Water and a single bird in the collection of the

Since writing the article I have accumulated some further information--largely
from my correspondence. Mr. Jackson, the authority on wild Keas, in New
Zealand, says as does Mr. Forshaw, that Keas and Kakas often use the foot as a
hand. Dr. James M. Dolan Jnr., of San Diego Zoological Garden, writes to say
that both the Fig-parrots-- Opopsitta and Psittacularostris --use their feet when
feeding as does, he goes on to say, the Greater Musschenbroek's Lorikeet
Neopsittacus musschenbroekii major. Watching my own Cockatiels gave me a
surprise for I have found one Pied male, bred last year, who can--unlike any other
Cockatiel that I've yet noticed--hold items in a free foot. And I was dogmatic
to say that Cockatiels never use the foot as a hand!
I do not argue with what Dr. Parkes says of the two Amazons (A. xantholora &amp;
A. albifrons ) except that if the two were to interbreed, as I suggested might happen,
they do not necessarily have to produce an " intermediate specimen ". Indeed the
offspring might look exactly like one or other of the parents and, from examining
a skin, one could have no way of knowing that they were hybrids. For example I
hold that the White-bellied Caique Pionites leucogaster and the Black-headed
Caique P. melanocephala are but geographical variants of the same species. They
look superficially very distinct. Yet when crossed 3 Black-headed to $ White-
bellied instead of an "intermediate specimen" being thrown up the offspring
looked absolutely indistinguishable from a "pure" White-bellied Caique--
personal observation of Mr. Frank Waite's bird. Indeed Hooded Crows crossed
with Carrion Crows produce chicks coloured as are the parents and not " inter-
mediate specimens". I remain sceptical partly from sheer pigheadedness but
mostly because the proof of this pudding (i.e. are A. xantholora and A. albifrons
the same species) could only be proved by experimentally hybridising the two and
examining the offspring and backcrossing if necessary.
Arguing against my own recalcitrancy there are many parrot species that share
the same range and do not interbreed. Yet in captivity cross with one another and
the hybrid offspring seem perfectly fertile e.g. Red-fronted and Yellow-fronted
New Zealand Parrakeets ( Cyanoramphus novazelandrae and C. auriceps ); Alexandrine
and Common Ringnecked Parrakeets ( Psittacula eupatria and P. krameri) and the
various Australian Rosella parrakeets Platycercus.
My pair of Spectacled Amazons (A. albifrons) almost ceaselessly flick the head.
This continuously directs attention to the face and the difference between the
Yellow-lored (A. xantholora) and the Spectacled Amazon is largely confined to
this region. This head-flicking might well be of value in avoiding confusion of
identity--and so hybridising. George A. Smith.

By Ralph Zackrisson (Gothenburg, Sweden)
In connection with a visit to a bird exhibition in Ystad in the autumn of
1969, I had a look in a pet shop in the little village of Kavlinge. In one
of the cages there was a pair of birds which nobody was really able to
identify. My interest in them was quickly aroused, although one of them
was in rather bad condition. This made me hesitate, but after some
consideration I made up my mind, took the chance and bought the two
birds.
Later the same day I paid a visit to a friend in Smygehamn, the southern-
most place in Sweden, and much to my surprise I found in his collection
another three birds of the same species as the pair I had already bought.
My friend very kindly let me have his three specimens, so I was fortunate
enough to bring home to Gothenburg no less than five birds of this still
unknown species.
All of the birds, three males and two females, were put into a box-type
cage, measuring 100 x 70 x 60 cm (40 x 28 x 24 inches), which I always use
for acclimatization of new birds during their first weeks in my possession.
One of the males was very ill and soon died, but the remaining four, an
older and a younger pair, seemed fit and were subsequently released in an
indoor aviary, 3 x 1-5 x i*8 m. (10x5x6 feet), which they shared with
some finches and waxbills.
During the spring of 1970 the two older birds started to build an open
nest in a birch thicket, but it was never finished. Soon afterwards I had
to go away for a couple of days, and on my return the female was dead.
On examination I found in her a soft-shelled egg, and so I concluded that
egg-binding was the cause of her death. As far as breeding attempts are
concerned, nothing else happened that year to my Pretty, or Cinnamon,
Warbling Finches (Poospiza ornata) of northwestern Argentina. The
question of their correct identification had now been settled, to a large

extent through help from some over-ambitious friends and their literature
on birds.
Next spring, 1971, the younger male turned very aggressive towards the
older male, so I found it advisable to remove the latter from the aviary
they had hitherto shared. At the end of June my new bird-house with
adjoining outdoor aviary was finally ready to be taken into use. Most
of my birds were immediately released there, but not the Warbling Finches,
since the male had now begun to fly around with nesting material in his
bill. However, some weeks passed without anything happening, while
the birds in the outdoor aviary were thriving and had started nest-building.
Thinking there was enough room in my new aviary for the Warbling
Finches too, I decided to let them out into it as well. The bird-house
measures 3x3x2 m. (10x10x7 feet) and the outdoor aviary 5x3x2m.
(17X 10x7 feet), planted with two small but thick elms and furnished with
some pine thickets and several branches.
This releasing was, however, one of the biggest mistakes I have made
with my birds, because the male Warbling Finch quickly selected a ter-
ritory in the aviary where he only accepted a pair of Grey-headed Social
Weavers (Pseudonigrita arnaudi). He became especially aggressive to-
wards a pair of Fawn-breasted Waxbills (Estrilda paludicola) and a female
Violet-eared Waxbill (Uraeginthus granatinus). Their general body
colours agree to some extent with those of the Warbling-finches, which
might be the reason for the male's great aggression. Sometimes he even
chased the above-mentioned birds inside the bird-house.
When the female soon started to build an open, cup-shaped nest in a
pine thicket about 1*5 m. (5 feet) above the ground, it became obvious to
me why nothing had come out of the male's earlier flying about with a thin
grass-blade in his bill. He only took part in the nest-building with an
occasional grass-blade now and then, otherwise he just made inspections.
The inner diameter of the nest measured 4-5 cm. (almost 2 inches), and it
was equally deep. Basically it was built of moss and grass-blades, lined
with horse-hair. Regrettably I was never able to watch any display.
On July 5th the female was brooding three eggs, which were about
17 x11mm. in size, coloured whitish with irregular brown spots. I
observed only the female sitting on the eggs, and she sat very well. The
male now fed her rather often in the nest with a variety of insects. She
left the nest only a few times a day in order to have some water, always
followed by her mate, who twittered incessantly until she had returned
to the nest again and recommenced brooding.
During this time he became more pugnacious than ever and also sang
rather energetically, but ceased his singing as soon as the eggs hatched.
When feeding my birds in the evening of July 17th, the male Warbling
Finch at once flew down on the ground, took some fresh ants' cocoons in
his bill and then flew up to the nest, in order to feed the female I thought,
but I was wrong. Instead the happy mother stood up in the nest to clear

the way for the father to feed the young, which were right below her.
Finally she had some food from her husband, too. So now the eggs had
hatched, but I don't know exactly when it happened.
Later the same evening when the female left the nest I saw my chance
and had a quick look down into it. There were three young ones, which
I estimated to be a few days old. They were greyish in colour with grey
down. I don't know exactly how long the brooding period had lasted, but
it should have been some 12-13 days.
The food I supplied to my pair of Warbling Finches to rear their chicks
with consisted of fresh ants' cocoons, mealworms and soaked sponge-cake
ad lib. When time allowed I also collected various other insects with a
net. These insects were put into a plastic bag, which I kept in a freezer
for a quarter of an hour. Then I thawed the insects and fed the birds
with them. However, I found that the thawing time should last for at
least half an hour.
Everything went well for a couple of days, but in the evening of the 19th
I observed that one of the youngsters had been thrown out of the nest. So
I went inside the aviary and on checking I found only one nestling left
and alive. After some searching the third young one was also found,
thrown out and dead.
Now, what was the cause of the two youngsters having been thrown out
of the nest? Had the male's feeding made them so replete with food that
he had received no signs of response from them when he returned to
feed them even more, therefore thinking that they were dead and conse-
quently throwing them out? No, hardly! Instead I guess that the male
didn't want to feed the chicks with the kinds of food that were offered him.
Then what to do? Well, I started collecting spiders, which is a very time-
consuming task. The spiders, however, turned out to be an extremely
appreciated food, and soon the male almost completely refused to feed
his progeny with anything else. Sometimes he also seemed to soak the
food in water before feeding.
The remaining young one was about eight days old when for the first
time I watched the female feeding it. She took some food out of the bill
of the male and fed the young one. I also watched the female flying out
of the nest with droppings in her beak. I am not quite sure, but I think
I have seen the pair feeding on the droppings before.
I now had another look at the young Warbling Finch. It had just got
its eyes open and a short little tail. The flight feathers had also started to
grow. When inside the aviary the parents continuously gave their
monotonous alarm call.
Suddenly the male started to show distressing signs of growing ill-health.
It seemed as if he had got something in his throat. He sometimes ate con-
siderable amounts of food in order, as it seemed, to swallow down some-
thing. Some days later he had become so ill that he no longer took part
in the feeding of the nestling. Then I realized that the best thing I could

do was to catch him up and put him in a hospital cage. I treated him
with terramycin, an antibiotic capable of curing several different diseases,
but this time it was of no help and the male Warbling Finch died within a
couple of days.
I can add here that a young Grey-headed Social Weaver died in the
same way. A post mortem of this youngster showed that it had died
from gapeworm (Syngamus trachealis).
Back to the young Warbling Finch. It left the nest the day its father
died and should by that time have been about twelve days of age. As it
was still far from fully fledged and quite unable to fly, I put it back into
the nest. The female, however, by calling at once persuaded it to leave
the nest again.
The following days the chick spent perching closely to the nest without
moving much, but the female still fed it. My helpful friends found in
the literature an earlier report on the breeding of this species in England
(Cummings i960). In that case the young ones had left the nest equally
early. Therefore I believe we must consider this early leaving of the
nest of Poospiza youngsters as a normal habit. There is another species,
the Jacarini Finch (Volatinia jacarina), from which I have bred
repeatedly, which to my mind is rather similar to the Pretty Warbling
Finch in several respects, e.g. nest-construction. Their young ones leave
those of the Warbling Finches and are the nest just as early as equally
helpless during their first days outside the nest, too.
The female fed the young one with mealworms only during the first
few days after its leaving the nest and she definitely refused to feed it
with anything else. This made me somewhat worried, feeling such a diet
must be too one-sided and nutritiously incorrect. However, the female
solved the problem herself when, some days later, she recommenced
feeding her progeny with all types of food offered.
At this time the hen had started to fly about with nesting material in
her bill again, and she also made efforts to build new nests in some
different spots of the aviary, but now there was no male to defend them
against nest material thieves. Therefore all her nest-building was in vain.
Why the other birds preferred hers to all the other nest material available,
I really cannot understand.
At the age of three weeks the young Warbling Finch had become
independent, so I caught up the female and let her in to the older, single
male. The two seemed to agree very well together and three weeks later
they began to construct a nest. In this case, however, the female did not
take the lead but instead the male did. The constructing went very
slowly, resulting in an incomplete nest.
In the same aviary there was a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills. They had
been kept together with the male Warbling Finch all spring and summer,
and there had never been any quarrel between them. But now he
apparently changed his temper all of a sudden, because one evening when

<bodyText confidence="0.999529315789474" page_id="56367322"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
I was about to feed my birds, the hen Waxbill had become rather badly
injured. I immediately removed her, and fortunately she recovered
fairly well. The male Violet-eared Waxbill, on the other hand, was
never attacked. The attack on the female Waxbill indicates, however,
that the aggression of the now dead male Warbling Finch during his
breeding period was evidently not occasional. Rather it seems to be
quite clear that they are aggressive only towards birds of colours similar
to themselves.
The colour of immature Pretty Warbling Finches differs from that of
the adult birds by being more greyish brown. The superciliary line is
white and the breast streaked greyish and white. Aged three weeks
they start to change into adult colour.
The young one, which turned out to be a female, is at the present
moment (mid. Feb., 1972) seven months old, in splendid condition and
fully coloured. It has also gone through a complete moult.
In conclusion it can be said that the young one healed from the sores
caused by the trouble-making father. I would also like to recommend
this species of Warbling Finch to any aviculturist having room enough to
allow them an aviary of their own.

BREEDING THE YELLOW-FRONTED KAKARIKI
OR GOLDEN-HEADED PARAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9964383" page_id="56367323"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
By P. Oderkerken (Germiston, Transvaal, S. Africa)
It can be seen from various magazines and advertisements that the
Yellow-fronted Kakariki (Cyanoramphus auriceps) seems to be establishing
itself in aviaries in Europe and Great Britain. Here in South Africa it is
not quite as common, but is in great demand, because of its lively disposi-
tion and its being an excellent breeder.
It is overall a dark shade of green being lighter on the chest and belly.
The forehead has a thin stripe of red (usually wider in males than females),
above this is the yellow patch which extends to the crown area. A tinge
of yellow can be seen behind the eye, but is inconspicuous in comparison
to the Red-fronted (C. novaezelandiae ), which has a crimson patch.
There is also a crimson patch on either side of the rump (usually hidden
by the wing). Primaries are dark blue and the under wing is grey with a
white wing stripe as in Reoplemas. This stripe seems to be more
prominent in the female. Iris is bright orange-red and the pupil black,
which dilates in courtship or excitement. Feet grey, upper and lower
mandibles blue-grey with black tips. Female is generally smaller and
has a smaller yellow front patch. Young birds slightly duller than parents,
iris colour less prominent and the dark tips on the bill are lighter in colour.
These birds have long legs and scratch like poultry and therefore I think
require turf in their aviaries. If this is not available, the birds will tend
to have long toe nails. They, as I have said, are very active and require
a fairly large flight, although they seem to be quite active in a holding cage.
The Kakariki is not an aggressive bird, but I would not put finches in the
aviary for breeding. Kakarikis are very curious birds and delight in
destroying nests of smaller land working individuals.
Their calls are not offensive to the ear and usually consist of a fast
"ah! ah! ah! " in repetition.
The pair are housed in a 12 ft. x 7 ft. high x 6 ft. wide aviary, of which
half is a fully enclosed wooden shelter.
The birds are strong flyers and I feel can use a longer flight than given.
The nest box 12 in. x 6 in. x 6 in. was placed in the shelter (at 45 0 ) and
the Kakarikis immediately began investigation. Another breeder is
using cockatiel size nest-boxes and I feel the base is too large for them.
His hen laid seven fertile eggs and when I inspected the young, he had
three chicks and the four eggs were strewn about in the corners of the
nest-box. I think the young tend to dislodge them and since the hen has
her hands full, with three hungry chicks, she has no time to consider the
other eggs. My nest box being small, concentrates the movement and
so far all eggs have hatched.

<bodyText confidence="0.999200466666667" page_id="56367324"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
The nest-box was filled with peat moss and wood shavings; from this,
the female made a " bowl " for the eggs. Kakarikis are credited with
laying large clutches, but my female has only had 5-6 eggs; all were fertile
and reared to independence.
The incubation period is 18-21 days and in one clutch the first
youngster appeared on the 2/1/72 and four young were seen on the 4/1/72.
The fifth youngster hatched two days later and as can be imagined was
much smaller and weaker than its companions, which had grown con-
siderably. I therefore felt sure that this youngster was doomed, because
it could not strive up against its companions to be fed. However my
female is a very good mother and she must literally have had to move the
other youngsters to feed the chick, which grew rapidly. On the 13/1/72
the eldest chick's eyes had opened and pin feathers had begun from most
body areas.
Up to this time, all young when recently hatched had white down,
which was rather wispy, but on the 17/1/72 all young had cast the white
down and it was replaced by grey down which was of a woolly texture and
must be warmer for the chicks. Iris colour at this stage is of a pale yellow-
brown texture.
Unfortunately, I was away when the young left the nest-box and could
not be sure of the dates.
Kakarikis are prolific breeders and will have three clutches (at least) per
year, but I feel three is already weakening the hen, so I take out the nest
boxes and give her a well earned rest.
Once the young are independent, you must separate the youngsters,
if you want to continue successful breeding. I have seen the cock feeding
the hen and was attempting to mount the female when an ambitious
youngster knocked off the hen and begged for food.
The cock also seems to be slightly aggressive towards his offspring.
After being out of the nest for two weeks the young are normally feeding
themselves.
My birds are fed on a mixture of canary, niger, linseed, oats and
sunflower--favourite being sunflower. Red apples, lettuce, italian spray
millet, milk thistle and other seeding grasses are given daily. Brown
bread and pro-nutro mixed with enough water to make the bread crumble
and germinating seed (oats especially) are given as a rearing food and is
greatly appreciated.
Yellow-fronted Kakarikis are hardy birds and will bath any time of the
year. A large bowl is needed for bathing purposes and should be filled
daily.
People seem to be of the opinion that Kakarikis are rather susceptible
to diseases and have a high mortality (see G. A. Smith, p. 186, vol. 75,
Avicultural Magazine); luckily I have had no trouble as yet, but since
they are ground birds and like scratching, they are liable to pick up stale
seed or any virus in a dirty aviary, so I keep mine clean every week as well as

giving them a strong dose of terramycin in the drinking water every now
and then. This checks any possible diseases at an early stage. I certainly
recommend the keeping of Kakarikis as they are easy to keep and intelligent
birds.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RINGNECKED
PARAKEETS
(Psittacula krameri)
By George A. Smith (Peterborough, Northants, England)
Introduction
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991075625" page_id="56367325"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
The " Red-billed parrots ", to a large degree, share several behavioural
and structural characteristics: as well as the possession of a red beak.*
Females are the dominant sex. (In Broadtailed parrots--Platycercinae
--males are usually more aggressive than females. In Neotropical parrots
both sexes seem reasonably evenly matched).
Most of the " Red-bills " take three years before they assume adult
plumage.
The sexes are of different appearance--that of immature males is
identical to that of adult females. (In those exceptional Broadtails where
there is a sexual dimorphism immatures look like " dulled " versions of
their respective sexes).
The cocks often have an elaborate and prolonged courtship display in
which the females play a " passive " part.
Most (all?) are non-territorial and often nest colonially.
Rain-bathing ( vide infra) is shown by many. Water-bathing is usual.
I believe that they do not sun-bathe. (Broadtails sun-bathe, water-bathe
and do not rain-bathe. Cockatoos rain-bathe and do not water-bathe.
Cockatoos, instead of bathing, seem to sit in the water and " souse "
themselves; while doing so they do not flutter the wings or duck the head.
Many Neotropical parrots rain-bathe, a few sun themselves--dozing with
a cheek turned to the sun. Broadtails droop the wings, spread the tail,
and fluff the head when they sunbathe).
Quite a few " Red-billed parrots " are well-known to aviculture:
Eclectuses, Barrabands, Princess-of-Wales', Lovebirds, " Psittaculids ",
Kings.
Except for Lovebirds Agapornis (Dilger i960)--which are, in any case,
aberrant in many ways--and Hanging-parrots Loriculus (Buckley, 1968)
little substantive seems to have been written about these parrots and the
following is an attempt to collect some " facts" about Ringnecks.
*Lories/Lorikeets also have red bills, and some, very few, Neotropical parrots
have their beaks, or part of their beaks, coloured a curious carmine-red, fruit-juice
shade.

G. A. SMITH--SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RINGNECKED PARAKEETS 121
This past year I formed a small community of three pairs of adult
Ringnecks and a single, immature, year-old hen. They are housed in
a twelve foot square by seven foot high, flight, overhung by a large
flowering Japanese-cherry. An open-sided asbestos hut provides shelter
for the food and sleeping birds.
The Ringnecks can be separately identified for they form " natural "
pairs: two lutino hens, two adult green cocks (one of the original males
was killed) and two normal green hens, and one of each of the " pairs"
has had the tail shortened with scissors.
The three nest-boxes are fastened to the outside of the wire along one
side of the flight and are slightly less than three feet apart. The examina-
tion door of each box is opened from the outside, as is the feeding-hatch.
Therefore I never need to enter the flight and disturb the bird.
Distribution
Ringnecks have the widest lateral range of any species of parrot: extend-
ing from the west coast of Africa, through India, to the south-east of
China--more than 5,000 miles (fig. 1). The distribution seems to be
determined by them showing a preference for " semi-arid country and
thorn scrub " at low altitudes in Africa (Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant, 1970)
and Burma (Smythies, 1953). Similarly in Ceylon where "it is a common
bird throughout the low country dry zone, especially in the coastal districts,
but it avoids the hills. In the wet zone it is scarce and sporadic" (Henry,
1955). I n India, however, perhaps because extensive clearings and
cultivation has taken place and allowed it to expand a previously more
restricted geographical range, it " affects moist--and dry--deciduous
biotype--even semidesert--keeping to light secondary jungle, gardens,
orchards and cultivation in the neighbourhood of human habitations "
(Ali &amp; Ripley, 1969).
Description
Ringnecks are so common in captivity that I shall limit myself to saying
that they are beautifully tapered, yellowish-green parrakeets of about the
same body-size as a Starling Sturnus vulgaris --the long tail extending the
total length to about fifteen inches. The bill is red, in both sexes--the
degree of black which infiltrates the red of the lower and upper mandibles
depending on different geographical areas. Adult males differ from
females, and immatures, in that they have a black throat-stripe which
curls round towards the back of the neck and thins out on the sides and is
replaced by a rose-pink band. The back of the head is powder-blue.
Weight (average of ten wild-caught adults) 116 grams (3I ozs.).
Feeding
All accounts of Ringnecks in the wild speak of what a nuisance they are
to agriculture. My own seem, unlike most captive parrots, extremely

indiscriminate in what they find edible--grains, seeds, nuts, cooked and
raw vegetables, seeding weeds, fruits, bread soaked in milk. When
feeding they make frequent use of the feet to support food taken up by the
bill. I have not seen them steady food by purposely standing on it. Two
Ringnecks usually--though not invariably--a mated pair, can often be
seen sharing a meal held in the foot of one of the birds. Though they
spend some of the day searching and walking over the turfed floor I have
yet to see them catch and eat earthworms and slugs as will some of the
Broadtail parrots.
Voice
The contact call, " Kee-ak " (Ali, loc. cit) is given far too repetitively
to make them ideal aviary birds and is made both when flying and at rest.
It is given most frequently when slightly disturbed, i.e. alert but not
terrified and just before roosting at night. The warning note is a
monosyllabic " Ak Ak Ak ..." which brings incubating hens out of the
nest and all Ringnecks within hearing tighten their plumage.
Immature males can sometimes be heard softly warbling to themselves.
Adult males seem to relinquish this pretty practice for I have not heard it
once they get a neck-ring. Adult males have a pleasant series of whistling
notes when they are courting.
Behaviour
Although Ringnecks are very sociable it is noticeable that they seldom
perch closer to one another than, say, six inches unless one of the birds is
dozing. Indeed wide awake Ringnecks do not look completely relaxed
unless a good foot of perch intervenes. They may accidentally brush
against one another when engrossed in feeding; but having taken a portion
of food they walk or fly a little way to eat slightly apart.
I believe that all six of my Ringnecks share the same sheltered perch at
night. Which, if it is so, must compact them a little for it is only three
feet long. There is another, seemingly, suitable perch which I doubt
they use.
There is no mutual grooming between the sexes: as part of courtship
cocks preen hens. I have never seen a hen preen a male although I have
seen a hen preen a chick.
Females assume the highest position in the peck (social) order. Males,
and young males in particular, are low in the ranks. Fighting is excep-
tional because the Ringnecks accept their non-egalitarian rankings--a
show of force being taken as the real thing.
In captivity females sometimes murder other Ringnecks. The previous
year, 1971, during the annual moult, one of the original hens developed
a malformation of the upper beak. (Caused by the Scaley-faced mite
Cnemidocoptes pilae). This odd-billed bird was suddenly attacked and
killed by the dominant hen, which is a lutino, within less than three

<bodyText confidence="0.988514821428571" page_id="56367329"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
seconds--for I tried to intervene. All the other Ringnecks clustered
round in excitement but were, I think, not participants. In January of
this year another adult, a male, was killed with a head bite when the
Ringnecks were brought into a smallish indoor flight that they might escape
frost-bite of the feet during the only three bad days of last winter. Some
years previously I had asked a dealer to send me a Ringneck corpse--for
anatomical purposes--He sent a dozen in one parcel, eleven of which
were males, mature and immature: all bitten through the skull by other
Ringnecks sometime during their crowded air-transit from India.
A large amount of their day is spent dozing fluffed out--often with the
head twisted over onto the back--in a roosting attitude and with the eyes
almost closed. Even in cold, short, days of winter little time seems to
be spent in eating and most of the day, except when courting, will be spent
languidly snoozing and occasionally preening.
I have sometimes seen an odd Ringneck, of either sex, turn the head
away from myself--to hide the conspicuous red bill--when they know they
are being watched, just as I have described for Malayan Longtails (Smith
1970). This behaviour is not general.
Water-bathing
I have not seen my Ringnecks bathe. Yet soaking-wet birds can some-
times be seen on the driest of days when the reduced level of the water
bowl and the dripping surroundings indicate that bathing might have
taken place. Twice I have seen one of my adult hens--not part of the
colony--walking round and round the rim of her water (dog's drinking)
bowl flicking her head in the water and slightly fluttering the wings.
After four or five minutes she has flown away, without stepping into the
water, looking perfectly dry except for a few splashes on the head and
flanks.

Harrison (1961) has described this for Cockatiels Nymphicus hollandicus
and for Blue-winged parrotlets Forpus passerinus . When rain starts to
fall after a dry period Ringnecks become greatly animated, flying to-and-
fro and, often, excitedly calling. Settling in exposed positions they open
the wings and sit with them drooped loosely by their sides, the tail spread
out, offering the maximum surface of the body to the rain and occasionally
shaking the body like a wet dog. They will hang suspended from a twig
or the roof-wire spreadeagled and then after half a minute or so fly off
to settle and rub the head and neck on wet leaves and the perch. Their
bedraggledness is intensified because they also hang sidewards on into the
rain soaking the flanks. A wettened Ringneck swishes the tail laterally
and flutters the wings rather like a sexually excited Broadtail. They

sometimes sit wet and uncomfortable-looking in the rain until so wet that
they have to seek shelter by crawling along the wire as if unable to fly
with such a heavy, wet, unkempt plumage. Vigorous preening always
follows rain-bathing.
Breeding
I have diary notes for immature male Ringnecks showing some form of
courtship activity over every month of the year--including June, July
and early August when they are moulting. Paradoxically adult males
rarely court from about early May until mid-autumn. I have been told
that exceptional Ringnecks can breed in their first year. Year-old birds
" play " their sexual roles; but, in my experience, they go no further. By
the second year the majority of males are sufficiently sexually developed
to breed though they will not get their neck-ring--and therefore look
precisely like hens--until they moult in late summer. Some hens lay in
their second year. I believe that most defer breeding till they are three
years old. The non-breeding second-year hens will have accepted a mate,
solicited for copulation, investigated and slept inside a nest box, etc. . . .
MacDonald (i960), writing of wild Ringnecks, suggests that they may
pair for life. It is noticeable with the birds in my captive colony that
once breeding is over nothing is seemingly done between the members of
a previously mated pair to " replenish " their pair-bond. There is no
mutual preening, no feeding, no sharing of nest-box as dormitory, no
sitting physically side-by-side--all of which are frequent in other parrots.
To my observation at this time of the year--summer/early autumn--the
pair-bond breaks down almost entirely and the birds seemingly become
individuals within the broader group. During the moult I could detect
no " cohesiveness" between members of a former pair: except that when
dozing they tended to be nearer one another than to other Ringnecks.
Most of the early courtship-display--post moult--seems to be directed
indiscriminately towards any hen--which, because there is some " habitual
cohesion ", is most likely to be the previous partner. The " old "
pairings are therefore not invariably re-established. As they flock in the
wild and may travel some way to feed I believe that the association between
the two sexes would be easily broken in the wild when not breeding.
Courtship
The circumspect courtship, by its avoidance of close physical contact,
demonstrates the very real terror held by males towards females. The
following descriptions are, of necessity, slightly generalised. I have tried
to show that breeding is determined by the time of year and by so doing
have largely ignored that, as said before, courtship by juveniles takes place
in any month of the year.

126 G. A. SMITH--SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RINGNECKED PARAKEETS
Males in the late autumn can be seen to sometimes walk in a slow,
deliberate, stately way--the head held high and with blazing eyes.*
The " iris rim " exposed by Eye-blazing is v/hite slightly veined and
streaked with blood vessels. Ringneck males also " fiddle " with the perch
near their feet and then raise the head quite high--perhaps repeating this
once or twice. Neither Bowing nor Stately-walking are protracted or
pronounced. Both take place even when no hen is visible. Bowing is
later " lost ".
By the early winter definite pair bonds can be made out as males
increasingly "see 011" their rivals. Near at hand they supplant by walking
directly up to a rival male and lunging at them with an open beak and
blazing eye. I have not seen males physically fight. The " gelling out "
of definite pairs seem to be formed with the males preening the hens on
the nape of their necks and the " butts " of the wings. They do not seem
to preen elsewhere. Head-preening requires some co-operation from the
hen. Whenever a male approaches a female there is always a large amount
of Beak-wiping by the cock. Beak-wiping may diminish with increasing
confidence but it never seems to subside completely.
In " Courtship-preening " which, except for hens sometimes preening
their youngsters, is the only allo-preening observed, the male stands as
far back from the hen as he can, by stretching to his maximum extent, just
making contact with his beak. One almost expects him to tipple over
(fig. 2b). His wings are raised slightly away from the body ready, it seems,
to surge him into instant flight if she should prove unresponsive. And yet,
to emphasize his boldness, he Eye-blazes. Females move little, if at all,
during this. If they but flinch the cautious cocks fly off a little way and
then, courage returning, start again. Even with the hen compliantly
quiescent the few swift, craning, caresses with the bill are so hastily
performed that they resemble pecking kisses. Following such a Pecking-
preen the male pulls head back and raises it high with the bill tucked in
tight against his stretched neck. The retraction of his head is so pro-
nounced that the leg nearest to her is lifted high in the air: perhaps enabling
the body to move back just that little further (fig. 2a). A momentary
pause and then the head shoots forwards, preceded by a few shuddering
taps of the uplifted foot on the perch, or in the air, to preen the hen once
more.
Every so often some relief to his seeming tension is given by his taking
one or two retreating steps backwards, wiping or tapping his bill on the
intervening perch. (Bill-wiping in Ringnecks is partly stylised to become
perch-tapping). Then he will step forwards to continue his Pecking-
preens.
*Eye-blazing means that the pupil is constricted to a pin-point by expanding
the iris to its maximum extent bringing the outermost edge of the iris--normally
concealed by the eyelids and sclera--into view. The outer part of the iris is
often brighter than the usually seen inner portion. Eye-blazing is a common
threat-behaviour in many, many parrots.

Preening ultimately leads to, and is interspersed with, bouts of courtship
feeding. This, generally, starts out in very late autumn and early winter.
Hens flatten themselves further onto the perch than when they have been
Pecking-preened. The hen pulls her head well into the body and twists
it to one side. Regurgitatory Head-bobbing, that is vomiting up food from
the crop by the male jerking his head up and down, is not obvious.
However, following this Bill-knocking/Bill-wiping and raising of his head,
and just preceding making contact with the two beaks, there is a momen-
tary pause, a slight, almost imperceptible halt. During this fractional
stop a slight puff of the throat, a slight crick of the neck is seen, as the food
is brought up into his bill. The male's head has to twist slightly as he
gives his offering to the twisted head of the hen. (Bill approach is head-
on and not as described for Caiques and Conures (Smith, 1971) where the
male physically seems to clasp onto the top of the female's bill at right
angles.) The springing back of the head and the foot-raising--" Saluting "
--are also part of courtship-feeding. This pull back of the head looks
almost as if the two heads were connected by a stretching elastic band.
The relatively slow pull back of the head, with the Saluting, and then the
sudden, snake-like, dart forward as the imaginary stretched elastic con-
tracts the heads together.

Males also Stately-walk and give stiff little jumps when on flat surfaces
--the ground and the food tray. I have not seen them Jump when walking
along perches.
</figureCaption>
<bodyText confidence="0.995698146341463" page_id="56367333"  page_num="128" year="" vol="">
In a few more weeks--early and mid-winter, the female puts her body
absolutely flat on the perch, back horizontal, and the wings slightly away
from the body. The male by this point is moving closer when preening
and feeding--and he seems to preen more than he feeds. The hen still
keeps her head screwed up close to the body with the head askew.
Copulation
After a while the male attempts to stand on her back but this takes many
fits and starts. For as he mounts the female he soon steps off. Even-
tually, and by many " practice " attempts, he preens the hen's nape rather
brusquely. Then, as she cowers the body submissively--they are now
standing absolutely adjacent, bodies touching--he gingerly steps a foot
on her back and stands on with both feet. The male has drooped wings
and Eye-blazes. Preening becomes ritualised into a " hammering " of
the base of her neck. " Hammering " because the male's head is lifted
high (Fig. 3a) beak tucked in, and then repeatedly " pounded " onto the
back of the hen (Fig. 3b) just as if he were trying to knock a nail through the
base of her neck using the " top " of the bill (culmen) as a hammer.
Hammering is a very rhythmical tattoo and the rate gradually increases
from about one " blow " in 1J seconds to a crescendo of more than one a
second during which more rapid rate, the tail is lowered and copulation
takes place. No changing of sides takes place during copulation as with
Lovebirds (Dilger, i960). After pairing--Hammering and copulation
take about four minutes--both birds shake their feathers and preen. The
male will then sometimes feed the hen.
Copulation seems to stop about half-way through incubation and is not
resumed. Feeding of the hen by the cock continues until after the chicks
are weaned.
All aspects of courtship are repeated persistently throughout the day.
MacDonald (loc. cit.) says that, for example, copulation may take place
" at hourly intervals ".
An extreme tolerance is shown when courting, as they seldom interfere
with one another. However a soliciting hen can stimulate sexual
adventure in another male. A feral Ringneck had been visiting my
aviaries since the middle of October. This wild male courted " Short-
tailed Green " who had no mate, and fed her through the wire. The
attraction was mutual and she used to come over to him. Eventually she
put herself into a copulatory posture which attracted one of the two,
already paired-off, males sharing the flight. This potential bigamist
tried to copulate with her but she drove him away. Nevertheless he
persisted and began to supplant the wild male--her " true spouse " by
flying onto the wire and frightening him off. The short-tailed hen

annoyed by this would then climb up the wire to where the " potential
bigamist " was now clinging and lunge at him driving him away. Females
are the dominant sex. This " sticking up for " her feral husband did not
last and after a few days she accepted the bigamist as her mate. Neither
of the two bigamist wives interfered in any way with one another nor
seemed annoyed by their husband's flirtatious behaviour. Bigamist
male divided his loyalties fairly evenly between the two wives. When they
nested he would enter one box and when the hen came out he would feed
her. After she had gone back into the box he would sidle along the two
foot of wire separating the next wife's box, enter that and then feed her.
The feral male disappeared about a week after the hens started laying.
About the time that hens solicit--mid-January--they are seen, ever
increasingly, searching for nest sites on the ground--I do not hang up
my boxes till early March. Like a Blackbird searching for worms the
hens pick up and fling to one side all leaves and loose litter that lie in their
path. And they start to dig holes in the turf of the aviary floor. Mining
is done with the bill. Large objects--roots and fibrous portions of turf--
are chopped and violently hauled out and thrown to one side--slightly
backwards in projection but never over the back. Looser material is
kicked backwards with strong scrapes of one leg followed by scrapes of the
other. Aviary woodwork and the perches--which till then were little
attacked--were chewed by the hens peeling and tearing off large splinters.
I put up my three boxes on the fourth of March. The three mature
hens showed an immediate interest. The males (quite unlike Broadtailed
parrots, Cockatoos and Neotropical parrots) showed no obvious interest
in the boxes. Dilger (loc cit) says (p. 667) of Lovebirds that " the female
in particular investigates entrance holes. The male remains close to the
female throughout these activities but his interest seems to be in her and
not particularly in the nest site ". This seems perfectly to apply to
Ringnecks.
The hens first examine the entrance holes by craning the neck forward
and peering inside and then pulling the head back just like a courting male
feeding a hen--the usual Ringneck behaviour when investigating any
potentially hostile object. Within less than an hour the hens had entered
and started chewing within. The three hens slept inside their boxes
from the first night. MacDonald records (p. 48) that wild females may
sleep inside their nest cavities from July onwards. The male does not
seem to help in excavating the nest chamber. Hens always fan the tail
out when entering the box in the early stages: this practice later wanes.
Males Crane-peer at the entrance hole just like hens. Hens keep other
hens away from their nesting holes. Usually nothing more than a snap
at another hen is enough to drive her away. Sometimes the interloper
may be mildly pursued--mildly, for as the two birds fly away from the box
the object of sending the other bird off has been achieved and the chase is
immediately stopped with the owner going straight back inside. Twice,

the first day, but never again, I saw fights in which both hens fell to the
ground in a maul. They soon separated and the " rightful " possessor
was always victorious.
It must be something about sleeping, or spending long times in the
box that make hens ovulate. On the 21st March, sixteen days from the
putting up of the boxes, two hens laid. The third hen laid the following
day.
The eggs were laid on alternate days, were white, roundish, and
averaged 8-7 grams in weight (twelve eggs). The dominant hen--the
lutino--laid five, the next in the peck-order--the first of the Bigamist's
wives--four; and the Bigamist's second wife--the lowest ranking hen--
three. Incubation seems to have begun with the first egg. However,
because previous to laying females spend most of their day inside the box
this is difficult to determine. Males often were seen to go inside the box
with the hen. Five to ten seconds afterwards both birds would emerge--
the hen first. She usualy defaecated, shook herself and then would be
fed by the male. Sometimes cocks spent longer periods--up to half an
hour--in the box with the hen. The feeding pattern is slightly less
flamboyant during incubation and especially once the chicks hatch.
Males now feed directly. The wings are not held away from the body.
The two birds stand almost, though never actually, in contact and slight
regurgitatory jerking of the head is seen--from the back view almost a
rippling of the body. The often repeated Bill-wiping--between ex-
changes of food--probably also serves to aid regurgitation. The pumping
movement seen during the actual exchange of food is created by the hen
jerking her bill. The near-side foot of the cock is not raised but may
be shuffled slightly or with some males kept fixed on the perch, during
head raising. Overall the impression gained is that they seem far more at
ease in one another's company. Sometimes both birds pull the head
back after food has been passed so that the female's movements almost
exactly duplicate those of males. A hen when receiving food always
holds her head screwed to one side.
The male mated to the dominant hen slept inside the box at night with
her once she had been incubating a week. The other male--Bigamist--
roosted in the shelter along with the immature female.
Male Ringnecks, if they can be said to be territorial, defend, and that
but slightly, the area around the person of their mate and fledged chicks
and not the nest hole. The immature, unmated hen was often seen
looking inside one or other of the nest boxes and often sat chewing the
wood of the sides. Neither male took any notice of this. Males, when
their hens are incubating, or brooding, spend some of their day lounging
on the perch immediately outside the nest hole containing their wife.
Sometimes the " wrong " male sat on such a perch and the rightful male
exceptionally might drive it off by supplanting, or more generally would sit
quite unconcernedly some foot or so away. This is not so for hens;

they tolerate no other Ringneck, other than their husband, less than a foot
from the nest hole or person.
My boxes are hung on a slope, the horizontal bottom of the box is a
bare wooden concave, and the slope down to the " concave " is laddered
with J in. square nailed laths. The hen Ringnecks chewed 1 \ in. to 2 in.
long splinters from the steps to line the bottom of the box. These splinters
plus a few down feathers were shaped into a definite nest and not just
idly scattered. Among the nest material in two of the boxes were twenty
or so husks from Sunflower seeds carried inside by the hen birds. I do
not know how they carried them--in the bill or in their feathers like
Lovebirds.
One hen was considerably more nervous than the others and she would
bring the other two incubating hens off their eggs by her alarm call
whenever she heard a strange or disturbing noise. The other two hens
would, after giving the " annoyance "--usually me--a quick look hasten
back onto their eggs. The nervous hen never went back until all
" danger" had passed.
The eggs took 26 days to hatch. The telescoping of incubating times
that occurs with eggs about the point of hatching brought some late laid
eggs forward in hatching time and delayed the hatching of some early
laid eggs. Actual figures for 10 eggs--two were addled--each indelibly
marked as laid and examined each morning at 8-30, were; One hatched
after 28 days; two hatched at 27 days--these three were the first eggs
laid. Six hatched at 26 days and one--the last egg laid of that clutch--25
days.
The three chicks--all hatched on the same day--of Bigamist's first wife
mysteriously disappeared on the second day of hatching. The first
hatched chick of the four of the " second wife " died when two days old.
The lutino " Boss " hen mated to a " split " lutino/" split " light-green
cock had two addled eggs, two lutino chicks and one light green. The six
chicks were weighed at 8-30 a.m. on one or two day intervals. Because
there is absolutely no demand for " normals "--imported Ringnecks
fetch a Pound wholesale--I substituted the Lutino's clutch for the normal
chicks when they were a fortnight old. Killing the normal chicks with
chloroform. Neither of the two pairs that lost their chicks renested.
On the day that the chicks disappeared the hens roosted inside the shelter
and not in their nest boxes. Courtship was not resumed. The hens
started chewing the insides of the nest boxes once again and within a week
had resumed roosting in them. Yet they never solicited again for copula-
tion. The males fed them less and less and after a fortnight or so the
practice stopped. Each pair still perched near one another during the
day, very often sitting adjacent to their nest boxes. They did not inter-
fere, with, nor show any interest in, the chicks in the third nest-box.
By six weeks the pair-bond had almost disappeared.

Chicks
The newly-hatched chicks (fig. 5) seem bare: close observation shows
them to be " bristly " with a scattering of a very few, very short (1 or
2 mm.) white " hairs ". Mr Ray Kyme kindly gave me an unhatched
Ringneck egg containing a nearly fully developed dead chick and this too
had the same short " stubby " down. (Budgerigars Melopsittacus undula-
tus ( pers . ob.) are born with similar extremely short " stubby " down,
although they sometimes have an odd wisp of longer down. Budgerigars,
however, are quite " hairy " in the egg and the down must be shed during,
or shortly before, hatching). The few " bristles " of the Ringnecks
chicks are abraded and lost after three or four days leaving the chicks
absolutely naked. Malayan Longtailed parrakeet chicks P. longicaudata
(fig. 4) are generically akin yet they are thinly clothed with rather long
white " hairs ".

might grow faster than females. This is partly substantiated by the three

normal chicks that I killed and subsequently sexed. Also by the light-
green chick, which is a female, for this character is a sex-linked " factor "
in Ringnecks. If my inference is correct then a male chick is half as
heavy again--for the same age--as a hen chick for the first three weeks of
life. If conditions are adverse for growing--shortage of food, chilling due
to absence of parents while foraging, then the bigger chicks--male chicks--
would be less likely to die than the smaller, for the same age, female
chicks. If there is this differential growth of the two sexes it may help in
explaining why it is that male Ringnecks (and other Psittacula parrakeets)
seem always to be more common than hens--even when captured as
immatures--and therefore are unsexable.
When the chicks are five days old many grey dots can be made out
under the skin of the back. These are the developing down-follicles, for
a fluffy down soon grows on the back, irrupting before the true feathers
form as " pins ".
When the chicks reached ten days old the parent hens spent some time
away from the box feeding. Before this they barely left them. At ten
days the chicks were about three times the hatching weight and the eyes
just opening. The biggest chick was rung when eleven days old (size
B12 ring). Its " sisters " were not large enough until they were fourteen
days old. Chicks grow rapidly in weight largely from the accumulation
of fat. The feathers over the shoulder-blades began to emerge from the
pins when four weeks old. The maximum weight is reached when six
weeks old and until they fledge at eight weeks they gradually lose some of
this surplus weight of fat.
The bills are red--after a straw-coloured start--and the juvenile beak
has the same outline of the adults. (Broadtails and the Australian " Red-
billed parrots " have an arrow-shaped tip to the bill, (see Cooper, 1968)).
The nest boxes remained dry despite the rather moist faeces. No
attempt was made to scratch out the accumulated litter. Both cock and
hen fed the babies. The male usually fed the hen outside the box and then
would fly to the next-hole, enter and feed the chicks, often immediately
followed by the hen. The hen brooded the chicks each night till they left
the box. From ten days of hatching the amount of day-time brooding
became less and less, so that by three weeks she barely brooded them at all.
The alarm set up by their mother whenever I fed the parents caused the
babies to " buzz " away in the box. Handling the chicks caused them to
make a harsher, further-carrying sound.
They were six weeks old before I caught them peering out of the nest
hole and the first chick left home when two days short of being eight
weeks old.
The other Ringnecks were greatly excited by its emergence and wanted
to attack it. The parents successfully drove them off; but it took almost
a week before each chick learnt to keep away from the nest-boxes of the

other two hens--where attack was most severe. By two weeks they were
cracking seed and by three weeks were almost independent.
Nodding
The Bigamist's second wife, before he " took her over ", used to
repetitively call with a particular strident note. At each note the tail
was flared and closed and between each bout of calls she would head flick.
Interspersed with these strident notes--which are in the same " category "
of sound as the contact call, but clearer--she would utter a disyllabic call

that sounded, to my ear, like " Dear Boy As she " Dear-boyed " the
head was nodded into a slight bow and the tail flared wings slightly de-
pressed (fig. 7). The head was pulled upright after each " Dear boying "
stopped.
Later one of the hens that lost her chicks was subsequently heard, day in,
day out, calling and seen " nodding " while sitting outside her nest hole
or sitting slightly away from it.
A further hen, not one of the colony, late paired to a skulking, seemingly,
asexual " cock often performed as described for Bigamist's second wife.
After a long period she laid three infertile eggs.
My interpretation of Nodding calls is that it is an advertisement call
from unmated hens wishing to breed.

By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
Although all three members of the genus Boissonneaua are beautiful, I
personally, do not find B. flavescen$, the Buff-tailed Coronet, desirable,
and as I have the other two specie^ in my collection, I doubt very much
if I shall ever be tempted to purchase a Buff-tailed.
Like all members of this genus, the Buff-tailed is a largish hummingbird,
being almost 5 in. overall length. The crown and throat are glittering
golden green. Upperparts are shining bronzy green; the breast is also
shining green turning to buff on the belly, with a few green feathers here
and there. Central tail feathers are bronze, the remainder being pale
buff, tipped and edged with bronzy green. Sexes are almost identical.
In my notes on this genus which appeared in the 9th July, 1970 edition of
Cage and Aviary Birds, I mentioned Coronets were highly pugnacious
and because of this were not really suitable subjects for a communal flight
or aviary of hummingbirds. I still stand by this, even though at the time
of writing I have a Velvet-purple Coronet, B. jardini, and a Chestnut-
breasted Coronet, B. matthewsii, in a flight with other hummingbirds.
What I have just written will seem contradictory and to explain myself, I
must go back to April, 1969. On the 5th of that month, I became the
proud owner of a Velvet-purple Coronet. For a number of years I had
dreamed of owning one of these truly fantastic hummingbirds, but until

the bird was actually installed in my birdroom, I had not really believed
I would ever be so fortunate as to realise this dream.
This bird was a little underweight at the time of purchase, it was also
showing a small amount of tongue. However, as it had only been in the
country just over a day, it had not had sufficient time to regain strength
and replace the loss of flesh caused through the long journey from
Ecuador.
For the first 14 weeks, the Velvet-purple was housed in a cage, 48 in.
long by 36 in. high by 16 in. deep, but as these quarters seemed rather
cramped for such a large hummingbird, I reluctantly parted with a Fork-
tailed Woodnymph, Thalurania furcata, which was housed in the adjoining
cage, took the divider out, thus allowing the Coronet to have a flight cage
twice as long as before.
After being with me four months, the Velvet-purple commenced to
moult. This is always a worrying time when it is the birds' first moult in
captivity, as I find it can be a lengthy process. Successive moults,
however, are usually quickly over.
I did not like housing such a large species in a cage and I had my doubts
as to whether the bird would moult out perfectly, having experienced
trouble in the past with Sparkling Violet-ears, Colibri coruscans, in that
their outer primaries sometimes came in deformed when cage moulted.
My fears were to be proved groundless, however, as in 20 weeks the
Coronet moulted out to perfection. This was, I admit, an exceptionally
lengthy moult but as I have already mentioned, I do find hummers can
take a long while over their first moult in captivity.
In 1970, the Coronet commenced its second moult in captivity on 8th
August and had completed this by 9th November. The following year
the Coronet commenced moulting on 30th July and finished 25th October,
thus taking approximately 13 weeks each time. This proves what I have
already mentioned; once the first moult in captivity is completed, suc-
cessive moults are little or no trouble.
While the Velvet-purple was in its second moult, I decided to attempt
keeping it with my other largish hummingbirds which are housed in an
18 ft. indoor flight. The birds in this flight were well established and as
the Coronet was in heavy moult, I did not expect fighting to break out.
As the Coronet had been living in a cage for 18 months, I fully expected
him to take a while to settle into the flight. He did prove a little difficult
when the birdroom lights were dimmed, but no more than a new addition
usually does. A few days after being released into the flight, the Coronet
seemed very settled and other than taking over one particular perch, he
was not in the least belligerent.
The time to tell whether a normally belligerent species is going to prove
suitable for housing with other hummingbirds, is just after a moult has
been completed. This is when hummingbirds are really at their peak.
The Velvet-purple did show aggression to some of the other hummers at

this time, but as these had become accustomed to him, they took little
notice and he soon gave up trying to intimidate any of them.
I did not witness a display from the Velvet-purple while he was caged.
I did consider some of his actions to be a form of " showing off ", however,
in that he would fly up and down the length of the flight cage very slowly
and, when alighting on a perch would hold his head and wings fully erect
for longer than is usual. While " showing off " the Coronet would feed
more often than was necessary, taking small sips from the nectar tube
before returning to the perch to stand proud again.
With the extra freedom of the flight, I did not have to wait long before
witnessing the true display of this species. In fact, within a week of
completing the moult, the Coronet was displaying regularly. In normal
flight, Coronets have rather slow wing beats, therefore I was not surprised
to learn the wing beats are slow in the display procedure also. The bird
holds the tail upwards at an angle of 60 degrees; the feathers are not
spread, however. The head is drawn in close to the body and the bird
hovers in front of the object of display using slow jerky movements. The
bill is held slightly open throughout. Although compared to many
species, the display of the Velvet-purple is rather simple, it does seem to
tax the bird somewhat, probably because of the unusual jerky movements.
After displaying, the Coronet usually alights on a perch and goes through
the actions of mating. After a particularly strenuous display, the Coronet
will take a few sips of water from one of the bathing saucers. This bird
also takes water after a particularly strenuous flight, therefore it is probable
that the water has a cooling effect.
The wing action peculiar to this genus is very much in evidence both
before and after the actual display, as before commencing to display, the
bird, while perched, will hold the wings erect and bob the head, moving it
from side to side at the same time. These movements give the impression
that the Coronet is hunting for a likely subject at which it can direct its
display. The upright wing action is also used when the bird goes through
the actions of mating, directly after the completion of a display.
When caged, the Velvet-purple would on occasions utter a loud call-
note, usually when showing aggression to birds in the flight opposite.
Once it settled to life in the flight, the Coronet started to sing regularly.
The song is rather subdued and one has to listen carefully to hear it.
The male Velvet-purple Coronet has most of the head, neck and throat
velvety black. The forecrown, upper throat, entire breast and belly is
glittering purple. The back and rump is glittering bluish-green.
Under wing coverts are orange-rufous; upper-tail coverts and the two
central tail feathers are black, remainder of tail feathers being white
edged and tipped with black. The female Velvet-purple is similar to the
male but is a little duller in colouration and sometimes has a chestnut
patch on the centre of the breast and buff bases to the feathers on the
breast and belly. All the females I have seen, have had white ocular

patches, whereas the males have not. Both sexes have a certain amount
of white feathering on the legs.
The male Chestnut-breasted Coronet is also very beautiful. It has
upperparts of shining green, with throat and sides of head glittering
golden green. The breast, belly and under tail coverts are deep chestnut.
Central tail feathers are bronze, the remainder chestnut, tipped and edged
with bronze. The female is similar but only has a few glittering green
feathers on the throat. As with the Velvet-purple, the Chestnut-breasted
has slightly feathered legs; these feathers are buff.
I purchased the Chestnut-breasted on the 9th July, 1971. I was du-
bious as to how long this bird would remain in my collection as I intended
releasing it into the flight and if the Velvet-purple took a dislike to it (and
coming from the same genus I thought it highly likely he would), I knew
I would have to part with the former as I had no intentions of keeping it
caged. Directly the Chestnut-breasted was released into the flight, the
Velvet-purple attacked and they fell to the ground with their claws locked
in each other's breast feathers. For a full minute both fought furiously,
then the Velvet-purple broke away, flew to the bathing saucer for a drink
of water and from then on kept well away from the Chestnut-breasted.
For a day or so the Velvet-purple seemed terrified of the newcomer,
although the latter completely ignored him. They have now been living
together for almost a year and as long as they do not actually perch close
to each other, peace reigns.
The Chestnut-breasted seems to ignore all the other hummingbirds in
the flight except for a Sapphire-vented Pufflegs, Eriocnemis luciani. This
Pufflegs attacked the Coronet when it was new to the flight and now the
latter seems to hold a grudge against it and whenever it has the chance to
have a sly dig at the Pufflegs, it does so.
Like the Velvet-purple, the Chestnut-breasted has a rather subdued
song. I have yet to witness a display from the latter, however, it is only
just completing its first moult in captivity, so will not be in breeding
condition for a week or so.
On sunny days, the Velvet-purple spends a considerable amount of time
sunbathing on the floor of the flight. This is not as unusual as it may
appear, as I have observed other species indulging in this habit. I have also
read an account in the wild where an Anna's Hummingbird, Calypte
anna , was observed sunbathing on a bare patch of ground (Bent, 1940).
A peculiarity of the genus Boissonneaua , is their habit of resting on one
foot in the manner common to most passerines. Relatively few species of
hummingbirds indulge in this habit and I doubt very much if the Coronets
actually sleep in such a position, as they would require both feet planted
firmly on the perch to remain stable during the night period. Humming-
birds do look rather odd when perched on one leg as they seem to find
difficulty in sitting upright at such times and always appear to lean
towards the foot which is holding the perch.

When one of us (MFW) was in Costa Rica for a summer, a common
question from non-ornithological colleagues was " Why are tropical birds
more colorful than those in the U.S.? " The present exercise was
stimulated by that question, since it was not clear that tropical birds are
more colorful, much less why.
We have attempted to classify the avifauna of South America, North
America, and Europe into categories of " colorful " or " not so ", but we
ignored degrees of colorfulness. Criteria for the division are necessarily
subjective, but we tried to be consistent in their application. If the
plumage of a species was described as having fairly large patches of bright
yellow, orange, red, blue, purple or green, or any combination thereof, it
was called " colorful ". For example, the Pileated and Red-headed
Woodpeckers of North America were called colorful because of the amount
of red on the head of at least one sex, but Downy and Red-bellied Wood-
peckers were not. Although some people would undoubtedly categorize
species by somewhat different means, we feel that the consistency of our
usage validates the approach. Decisions about colorfulness were based
on descriptions and pictures in three sources : Meyer de Schauensee
(1970), Robbins, et al. (1966), and Petersen, et al. (1966). Some species
that could be considered striking, flashy, and conspicuous (such as
American magpies) were not, however, called " colorful ", for their
conspicuousness is derived from e.g. black and white patterns, and we felt
that this was not included in our colleagues' questions. We omitted
consideration of primarily aquatic and nocturnal families for the same
reason.
At the same time, we recorded the incidence of sexual dichromatism in
each species and the habitat of each. Habitat, when given, usually referred
to the breeding habitat, at least for North American and European birds.
Habitats were classified into two general types: "open" (marshes,
grassland, sand, etc.) and " wooded " (all woodlands and forests, scrub,
etc.). Finer subdivisions were not practicable owing to authors' differ-
ences in descriptions. The South American avifauna was split into
" lowland tropical " and " non-tropical ", which refers both to latitudinal

and altitudinal zones that are not tropical according to Meyer de
Schauensee (op. cit.), and to wide-ranging species occupying many zones
including tropical.
Regional differences in frequency of colorfulness and dichromatism are
clear. / 2 tests (P &amp;lt; 0*05) between pairs of regions indicate the following
ranking:

Birds of the South American lowland tropics are therefore more fre-
quently colorful than those of North America or the South American
nontropics; a consideration of degree of colorfulness or combinations of
color would have emphasized the difference. European birds are
relatively dull in color. Colorfulness is not particularly associated with a
tendency toward dichromatism, for North American and South American
tropical birds have a higher proportion of sexually dichromatic forms than
the others; Europe and the South American nontropical avifaunas tend
toward sexual monomorphism.
In almost all cases the incidence of sexual dichromatism and colorfulness
in open habitats is similar to their incidence in the entire regional avi-
fauna. An exception is found in the South American nontropics, where
colorfulness in open habitats is significantly (% 2 , p &amp;lt; 0-05) less frequent
than in the whole avifauna. Given that a species lives in an open habitat
then, it usually has the same probability of being colorful as any species
taken from that avifauna.
Although in all four regions the percentage of colorful and sexually
dichromatic species that live in the " open " habitats is markedly less
than the per cent that live in wooded habitats, the relative number of
species living in the open is also less than that of wooded areas. Neither
kind of habitat, then, is relatively more conducive to the development of
dichromatism or colorfulness.
Certain families clearly contain relatively more dichromatic or colorful
species than other families. In addition, for each region, certain families
are the largest contributors of species to the dichromatic and colorful
portions of the avifauna. However, seldom is an entire family dichro-
matic or colorful, which argues to some extent against genetic fixation of
such a trait within a phylogenetic lineage, in most cases.

American Fringillidae and Thraupidae (Skutch 1940), and in African
Ploceidae (Moreau i960) was associated with duration and nature of the
pair bonds, social behavior in the nonbreeding season, degree of mi-
gratoriness, and, for some, habitat. For comparisons of regional avi-
faunas, however, the explanations do not seem to be general ones. For
instance, dichromatism (seasonal and permanent) is least developed in the
European and South American nontropical avifaunas, but we expect that
long distance migration or wandering is probably more common there than
in the South American lowland tropics.
Perhaps a general explanation is unavailable. Hamilton and Barth
(op. cit.) list several kinds of selective factors that influence the evolution
of species-specific plumage patterns. These, and perhaps others, prob-
ably vary in their importance among species. Colorfulness is equally
difficult to assess, especially in view of our ignorance of the possible
cryptic nature of bright plumages amidst brightly colored flowers, fruits
and leaves, and of our lack of information concerning relative predation
rates.
Summary
Tropical birds of South America are more frequently colorful than those
of North America or nontropical areas of South America; European birds
are the least colorful of all. Assessment of degree of colorfulness or color
combinations would likely increase most of these differences. Sexual
dichromatism is most common among members of the North American
and South American tropical avifauna, and least in Europe and the South
American nontropics. Habitat association of these characters are not
generally evident, and taxonomic associations not very helpful. At this
time we seem to lack a general explanation for the evolution of the
observed tendencies.

148 PROFESSOR DR. HEINZ-GEORG KLOS--NEWS FROM THE BERLIN ZOO
NEWS FROM THE BERLIN ZOO

After waiting for years, we finally succeeded in breeding a Trumpeter
Swan ( Cygnus c. buccinator ), the first on the European continent. During
the time of the settlers in America, towards the end of the 19th century,
this species, the largest swan of the world, hitherto widespread, was soon
threatened with extinction. Strict precautions were taken to save this
species, but the birds are still rare in America (about 2100). So we are
extremely pleased with our success and do hope it will now be repeated
every year.
Also very rare (as was mentioned in an earlier report) are the Hawaiian
Geese ( Branta sandvicensis). After our first pleasant success in breeding
two young of this species last year, we are now able to report the fine
number of six.
In our valuable crane collection, the White-necked Cranes (Grus vipio)
laid eggs every year. So far they had been sterile, but this spring a
young one was hatched in the incubator and hand-reared.
Interesting newcomers are three Striped Owls ( Rhinoptyx clamator)
from the Gran Chaco in South America. These prettily coloured owls
are not only seldom exhibited in zoological gardens, but also belong to the
ornithological rarities in their native country. Their preferred habitat
is grassland and open forests. Contrary to most owl species which nest
in the trees, the Striped Owl sits on the ground among thick bunches of
grass. On light sandy ground among dead halms their striped-ochre
plumage is a perfect camouflage against animals or birds of prey.

The Hawaiian Goose, which was saved from extinction due partly by
a highly successful captive breeding programme at the Wildfowl Trust,
Slimbridge, is facing a novel threat. The species is having to compete with
hippies, who have settled in the National Park in Hawaii, for the native
strawberries which form an important part of their diet. Fortunately
the Nene will eat other flowers, seeds and berries which the hippies will

Our member R. W. Goodwin of Cheltenham has got together during
the last few years a comparatively small but very select collection of rare
Parrakeets accommodated in a range of practical, well constructed,
attractively laid-out aviaries. The collection includes such rarities as
Salawati and Australian King Parrots, and Crimson-winged, Cloncurry
and Blue-cheeked Rosella Parrakeets. In 1971 the following parrakeets
were reared successfully: 5 Cloncurries, 4 Pileated, 4 Rock Peplars, 1
Barnard, 6 Pennants, 4 Stanleys, 4 Barrabands and numerous White
Cockatiels.
No-one can have done more to advance the cause of aviculture than
Len Hill. When he first opened his lovely gardens and aviaries to the
public about fifteen years ago he could scarcely have imagined the im-
mense pleasure which countless visitors would derive from " Birdland
Many all-bird Zoos have been established in recent years but few can
compare with " Birdland " in the way in which perfect specimens of
exotic species are exhibited in a beautiful garden setting. One of the most
outstanding features is the large Tropical House at the entrance of which
are several small planted enclosures which accommodate, at the present
time, Jamaican Streamer-tailed, Coquette and Racquet-tailed Humming
Birds in perfect condition. Inside the house can be seen the most glorious
male Quetzal with every feather absolutely perfect. If you sit quietly in
this beautifully planted enclosure you will soon be able to observe closely
Banded and Giant Pittas, Thailand Hoopoes, Bee-eaters of different
species, Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots, Royal and Amethyst Starlings
and many others. The pair of Little Minivets are known to be at least
twelve years old. The Indian Zosterops breed there every year and a pair
of White-browed Robin Chats reared youngsters for several successive
years until their aggressiveness necessitated their removal to another
enclosure. Last year the Giant Pittas built a nest the size of a football
but nothing more happened. In April this year a Pied Jacobin and a
Sabre-winged Humming Bird were building a nest as also were a pair of
Yellow-crowned Bulbuls.
The Tropical House was built several years ago. More recently a large
walk-through aviary intended to house Birds of Paradise was constructed.
It has not been entirely successful in its original intention because the
Red Birds of Paradise which were its first occupants began to fight badly

as soon as they developed adult plumage and they had to be removed.
However it accommodates a successful breeding colony of Rothschild's
Grackles, a pair of Green Oropendolas and a pair of the exquisitely beautiful
Palawan Peacock Pheasants which hatched a chick in 1971 but let it die
when it was 23 days old. Next is another newly constructed aviary
which makes perfect quarters for Victoria and Scheepmaker's Crowned
Pigeons and for more Rothschild's Grackles.
The Penguin enclosure, a great attraction to visitors, accommodates
the King, Rockhopper, Gentoo, Jackass, Humboldt and Macaroni species,
all of which except the Gentoo have bred. The collection is constantly
expanding and recent arrivals include Wilson's Birds of Paradise,
Carmine Bee-eaters, two Renauld's Ground Cuckoos, two Indigo Flower
Piercers, four Mountain Witch Doves from Jamaica to add to the two
unmated cocks in the Tropical House, White-crowned Pigeons and
White-fronted Doves, a very rare Challenger Lory and two Moluccan
King Parrots (one Amboina and one Salawati) which, it is hoped, are a
pair.
Len Hill is an ardent conservationist and his main objective is to keep
pairs of relatively few species in conditions conducive to breeding. Hahn's
Macaws have bred consistently in the Gardens and it is hoped that some
of their offspring will ultimately be responsible for the restocking of the
native habitat where they appear now to be extinct. Other breeding suc-
cesses in 1971 include one Purple-naped Lory, three Senegal Parrots,
four Rothschild's Grackles, four Bleeding-heart Pigeons and five Bearded
Tits. Swift Parrakeets were hatched but not reared. The Gardens are
constantly being improved and, after the opening in May of a Wild Life
Art Gallery, the next development will be the reconstruction of the old
Tropical House near the main entrance to provide ideal accommodation
for possible breeding pairs of Cock-of-the-Rocks and similar attractive
rare species.

WILDFOWL IN CAPTIVITY. By Richard Mark Martin. London:
John Gifford, 1972. Price #1.75.
Waterfowl keeping and breeding is becoming increasingly popular, and
also more and more useful, for it no doubt constitutes at present the best
way of saving numerous species threatened with extinction owing to
human persecution and habitat destruction.
The present work is the latest published book on the practical treatment
of wildfowl in captivity, and it is an unusually satisfactory one. Without
any pretence to be a scientific monograph, it certainly achieves its object--
to give beginners all the information and advice which they require.

The author shows a great deal of personal experience and he writes
attractively. The first three chapters consist of an introduction to
wildfowl, the conception of confining wildfowl and their general manage-
ment. They could not have been better written; easy to read they cover
all one should know when one starts.
The fourth and longest part is a general review of the family tribe by
tribe. It is accurate and sufficiently detailed. Practical information on
the various species or group is sound, personal and pleasantly expressed.
Thirty-two excellent photographs illustrate the text and there are useful
line drawings of different installations.
A most commendable little book, which will help all those who begin to
indulge in the delightful hobby of waterfowl keeping.

Nature Series. London: Oak Tree Press, 1971. Price #1.25.
This little book is one of an excellent series of introductions to various
animal and plant groups. In this volume the embryonic development,
birth and growth of a bird is followed by a varied selection of British birds
to show their diverse habits and adaptations to different environments.
The book is profusely illustrated with splendid close-up and X-ray
photographs, and should appeal to all ages.

BREEDING OF BREWER'S BLACKBIRD
IN THE BERLIN ZOO

{Euphagus cyanocephalus)
By Wolfgang Grummt (Curator of Birds, Tierpark, Berlin, GDR)
In March 1969 through the kindness of my friend Dr. James M.
Dolan Jr. of the San Diego Zoo we received a number of various small
birds and included among them was a pair of Brewer's Blackbirds
(Euphagus cyanocephalus). This species occurs in open country in
western north America from British Columbia to California, North
Arizona and New Mexico.
The feathers of the male are glossy black with a purple sheen on the
head. The iris is white. The female is predominately grey and is
similar to the female Rusty Blackbird in appearance, though can always be
distinguished from this species by the dark iris.
In 1970 we kept the pair in an outside aviary 4m.x2m.x2m.
together with White-crowned Sparrows, Mourning Doves and Hume's
Bar-tailed Pheasants.
We often observed the display posture described by Williams (1952) as
" ruff out ". In this posture the male holds the bill horizontally or
stretched slightly upwards with the feathers on the head, neck, breast and
upper tail-coverts erected. In addition it " spreads the wings downwards
and fans and depresses the tail, and at the climax either " squee " or
" schl-r-r-r--up " is uttered, and then display immediately subsides.
At the beginning of June a nest was constructed in a few days in the
fork of a branch 1.60 m. up in a bush. The female built the nest alone
and the male was only occasionally observed carrying nesting material.
Both dry and fresh blades of grass were used for nest material and also
damp earth so that the interior of the nest is similar to that of the Song-
Thrush. On 5th July the first egg was laid and by 8th July three further
eggs were laid at intervals of about 24 hours. The eggs are comparatively

large and the ground colour is blue-grey with grey, brown and black spots.
The female only broods. On 20th July only two eggs remained in the
nest and on 21st July the nest was empty.
In 1971 display and nest building again took place but without any
successful breeding. Only the remains of broken eggs were found in the
aviary.
At the beginning of January 1972 we placed the Brewer's Blackbirds in
a glass compartment of 2 m. x 1.8 m. x 1.2 m. and by the end of January
the bird keeper noticed that nesting material was being carried about.
We therefore provided an old Blackbird's nest as a foundation and on
12th February the female carried dry blades of grass and Scotch Pine
needles (Pinus silvestris ) and built actively in the old Blackbird's nest.
One day later an egg was laid and by 18th February a clutch of six eggs
was completed.
This early start to breed was very surprising as, according to Williams
(1952), breeding does not start till the middle of April.
The female again undertook all the brooding. On 29th February two
young hatched and on 1st March there were four young in the nest.
The fifth young did not hatch till 2nd March and the sixth egg disappeared.
As the female began to brood immediately after laying the fifth egg on
17th February the young therefore hatched after an incubation period of
12-13 days, as has already been noted by Williams.
The adult birds are rather shy and only on a few occasions could be
observed caring for the young. Both male and female fed the young
almost exclusively on live food (mealworms and cockroaches). Soft
food with dried ant eggs, hardboiled eggs and curds were certainly eaten
by the adult birds but whether they also gave this to the young could not
be ascertained. The young birds are covered in smoky-brown down and
the eyes opened in 6-7 days.
One young bird was missing on the third day and on 10th March a
youngster was found dead in the nest, but the other three grew well. At
14 days of age the young were fully feathered and similar in colour to the
female, though there was still some down on the head and the tail was not
full grown. In 16 days the young left the nest (according to Williams they
fly at 14 days) and at once ran around sturdily on the aviary floor. The
young were still fed by the parents though even after a few days of leaving
the nest they were observed to be feeding on their own. At the age of
five weeks the young birds began to moult their small feathers and in the
males--there are two males and one female--the first black feathers were
already showing on their breasts.

By George A. Smith (Peterborough, Northants, England)
With the exception of Quaker Conures Myiopsitta monachus , parrots
lay their eggs in sheltered cavities--most species select holes in trees.
Although a parrot's bill is excellent for whittling and tearing off portions
of wood it is not such a good tool to excavate the whole of the chamber
and most species make use of pre-existing holes.
In the wild competition for suitable nest-cavities must be intense and
several species avoid disputation with other hole-nesters by boring into
termitaria which, once the crust is perforated, excavate easily. Keas
Nestor notabilis nest in small natural caves (Jackson 1963) and Patagonian
Conures Cyanoliseus patagonus breed in colonies in tunnels excavated by
themselves in near-vertical cliff-faces (Johnson 1967).
In captivity parrots are generally provided with wooden nest-boxes.
A few ingenious aviculturists have supplied artificial " white-ant nests "
for those parrots that naturally nest in the mounds and bosses produced
by these insects, e.g. Perry (1959) tells how Red-faced Lovebirds
Agapornis pullaria successfully bred after they had bored their tunnel
in a large piece of cork (12 in. x 10 in. x 6 in.) encased entirely with wood
except for the face-side. With the same difficult species Prestwich
( I 957) g ot many pairs to nest in holes that they dug in peat-filled barrels.
Success, perhaps because of the dryness of the peat, was unfortunately
not very high. Reverting to nature Hey (1967) cemented four termitaria
together when he bred from his pair. In experimental studies of South
American conures Hardy (1963) and Power (1967) used coated polystyrene
masses and then, when they were found unsuitable, blocks of cork.
Complete success did not occur with either the Orange-fronted Conures
Aratinga canicularis or the Orange-chinned Parrakeets Brotogeris jugularis.
I believe that I have read somewhere, though I cannot find the reference,
of one early breeder of Hooded Parrakeets Psephotus chrysopterygius who
had success with a " real " ants' nest. However all these species have
before, or since, successfully brought off young in the more usual wooden
box. Quaker Conures--which normally build large communal nests of
twigs in the branches of trees--nest readily, perhaps preferentially, in a
nest-box. Certainly when nest-boxes are given to a colony of Quakers
they nest in these, dragging some sticks inside and then try to encompass
the boxes with twigs rather than building a twig-nest first before laying.
Authors often stress the importance of having a high humidity within
the box---by having a layer of vegetable compost: damp peat, rotting wood
or inverted turves. The way to avoid rickety or pneumonic chicks,
says Tavistock (1927, 1929, 1930) is to provide an open-sited box with
moist contents of peat moss or decaying wood--as well as feeding Cod-
liver-oil soaked seed. The build up of noxious gases at the expense of

oxygen--together with desiccation--is given as the main cause of loss
with " dead-in-shell " in incubated chicken eggs (Allcroft 1964, Carter
&amp; Freeman 1969). Decaying vegetable composts could well produce
such " noxious gases " and no matter how damp when put inside the box
all litter dries, unless especially thick, before incubation is completed--and
high humidity is especially needed about hatching time. L. P. Luke
(1952) designed a nest-box, for Lovebirds, which had a dish of water
inserted beneath the nest pan.
Eggs of different species of birds must vary in their resistance to
desiccation: waterfowl eggs have very poor hatchability in incubators
designed for poultry--unless liberally sprinkled with water. And
pigeons' eggs aerially suspended as they are in the flimsiest of nests, or
Ostrich eggs laid in desert sand, must be quite resistant to drying. Holes
in trees are often dry--certainly those selected by indigenous birds--
sometimes tinder dry. The holes that are available to wild parrots might
also often be absolutely clean of rotten wood: either because they were
bored in a living tree by barbets and woodpeckers, or by having been
scoured out by termites. Nesting holes are more likely in the middle of
trees--where the bole and thick branches are--which is generally dry
as rain is cascaded outwards by the umbrella of foliage.
All the species of parrot that I've bred seem especially concerned to
remove as much of the loose litter as they can by digging with the beak
and scratching backwards with the feet. Larger items are carried out in
the bill. Before Tavistock, most people used to suggest half a Coconut-
shell cemented in the bottom of the box as a receptacle for the eggs.
With the possible exception of Cockatiels Nymphicus all the parrots
that I have bred have built some sort of nest upon which to lay their
eggs. (My boxes are provided with " chewable " strips, as steps, of
soft-wood.) Most parrots are contented with a simple layer of splinters
yet Eclectus, New-Zealand Parrakeets Cyanoramphus spp., Abyssinian
Lovebirds A. tar ant a, Weber's Lorikeets Trichoglossus haematod weberi
(Kyme pars, com.) incorporate quantities of feathers, shed (?) from the
brood patch, in the nest box filling. Fourteen species of parrot, other
than Lovebirds, Hanging-parrots Loriculus and Quaker Conures, have
been reported to take nesting material into the nest hole. These include
Palm Cockatoos Probosciger , Black Cockatoos Calyptorhynchus spp.,
White Cockatoos Cacatua spp., Caiques Pionites (Deurer-Bury 1972),
Aymara and Lineolated Parrakeets Bolbopsittacus aymara , B. lineola
(Prestwich 1967, pers. ob .), Splendid Grass-Parrakeet Neophema splendida.
Perreau (1909) reports that Blue-winged (Parrotlets?) Forpus passerinus
like Splendid Grass-Parrakeets, Hanging-Parrots and Lovebirds carry
nesting material in the rump feathers. Celestial Parrotlets F. coelestis
nesting with me certainly brought bits of chewed paper and bark into the
nest chamber both before the eggs were laid and more continually after
they had hatched.

In an attempt to see if vegetable matter is necessary I have experimented,
over the past three breeding seasons, with various nest-box " fillers
Coupled with these experiments I have also built some rather curiously
shaped boxes to see if I could assess the value of such variables as: size
of entrance hole, depth of box, ease of descent down to the nest depression,
floor area, and the darkness of the chamber. Because any " standard "
or " control " with which to compare my results is lacking the observations
that I shall make are offered as nothing more substantial than my (present)
opinion.
I can say, with absolute truth, that I have yet to have a chick " dead in
shell " in outside boxes when the eggs have been laid on bare wood or
on a layer of chippings pared off by the parents. This is with such varied
species as Red and Yellow-fronted New-Zealand Parrakeets C. novaese-
landiae and C. auriceps , Indian Ringnecked Parrakeets, Malayan Long-
tailed Parrakeets Psittacula krameri and P. longicaudata , Cockatiels,
Many-coloured and Red-rump Parrakeets Psephotus varius and P.
haematonotus. This was not the case when I used to fill with rotten
wood, turves and/or damp peat.
My parrots are given ample bathing facilities and the incubating hens
(and incubating cocks as well with Cockatiels) often bathe and they will
return to the eggs in a soaking condition. If they sit on dry peat (is there
any substance less liable to take up water than bone-dry peat?) or dry
compost, the nest-box " filler " always dries on the top--the water in the
bird's plumage can hardly affect the litter. Sitting on wood the whole
area in contact gets wet.
Indoors the situation is different, my Blackheaded Caiques Pionites
melanocephala have had, from four clutches of three eggs, but a single
chick hatch each time--the rest being dead in shell. The fifth clutch
had a teaspoonful of water (5 ml.) put into the nest once a week and two
of the four eggs hatched. The sixth and present clutch of three eggs was
watered more generously with half a cup of tepid water once a week--the
nest easily absorbs this quantity for it is more than an inch deep with wood
parings and moulted feathers--all three have hatched and at six weeks old
look like being reared. This particular Caique hen does not often bathe.
Celestial Parrotlets in the same shed hatched all their fertile eggs (four
out of eight) with no " irrigation " except for two separate, and rather
slight, sprinklings of the outside of their box with water. Celestial
Parrotlets, I believe, do not bathe in standing water. When my chicks
hatch in these bare-bottomed boxes (the bases are carved into a cupped
nest-pan) and if the parents have not supplied enough splinters I put an
occasional sprinkle of sawdust to absorb the faeces.
According to the article on nest sanitation in A New Dictionary of Birds
parrot chicks are supposed to have particularly dry faeces that powder
up and so avoid soiling of the nest. From my own observations it seems
that the nature of parrot chicks' " droppings " depend entirely upon
</bodyText>

the amount of moisture fed by the parents--or the hand-rearer. The
" powdering " does not seem to be other than dehydration of faeces
voided in a warm environment. I have noticed with parrot chicks
that they deposit their " movements " away from the nest hollow--by
backing outwards--from an early age. This habit allows the faeces to
dry before they get carried back on feet, or enveloped by the expanding
size of the growing chicks.
Parrots can be rather dull subjects when nesting, for many of the
interesting things are taking place inside the box. It is often said that
disturbance will bring about desertion. I suppose that it might; but I
have never experienced it with my own, much interfered with, stock.
Indeed I have found that my frequent examination has often helped to
avoid catastrophe by detecting ailing or dead chicks, etc. Most people
hang boxes inside the flight. When these are examined it does create
considerable disturbance. I overcome this by clamping mine to the
outside--the birds enter through a hole cut in the wire where it passes over
the entrance hole. Examination is easy and quick; the difficulty I find is
getting the hens off the nest---I prefer to wait till the female is in the
flight, or shelter, before taking a peek. Some hens need shooing off;
others refuse to budge and eggs or chicks have to be seen when the
incubating hen attacks or moves away flightly from the examining hand.
Chicks in vertical-sided and deep boxes--even when these are fitted
with a good " ladder " or wire mesh--sometimes die with ruptured livers
damaged by the parents dropping the last few inches of their descent onto
the backs of the chicks. With my Cockatiels the mortality, from ruptured
livers, was extremely high (50% of five clutches) using boxes with the
nest floor more than 18 in. from the entrance hole. Chicks move away
from the light once the eyes open and the parents also lay in the darkest
part of the chamber. In short boxes this would mean that clutches are
generally not immediately under the hole, whereas in tall boxes this area
is dark enough for nesting. Because of this danger all my boxes are now
hung on the slope. The " ladder " which allows the parrot to climb from
the hole to the bottom of the box is important, e.g. staples, part knocked
in, to form two parallel rows (similar to the illustration in Groen 1964)
proved impossible for Cockatiels--they are not particularly good climbers.
Wire mesh is certainly the best " ladder " for vertical boxes. With my
sloping boxes the " descending " side has cross spars of branch segments
or soft timber as steps.
It is difficult to prove but I do believe that parrots nest more readily in
cramped rather than spacious boxes. Hardy (1963 p. 188) writes " most
species of bird that dig their own nest cavities make them barely large
enough to accommodate only one adult and the eggs or young. This is
certainly the case in some parrots, such as Amazona finschii. These
cavities are occasionally so small that it is difficult to believe that an adult
bird could incubate the eggs or brood the young therein ". Several

nesting accounts in the literature show parrots--given a choice--selecting
a small box. e.g. David West writes (1957) of Pileated parrakeets
Purpureicephalus spurius that " instead of taking one of the two large
boxes especially hung for them at the rear of the aviary the hen chose the
nest-box intended for the pair of Tourquoisines. This was not
a large box, being about 12 inches high, eight inches deep,
and six inches wide The most successful breeder of Grass-parrakeets
known to myself--the late Mr. W. Drake of Eye, Peterborough--used
boxes only three or four inches square at the base. I built an experimental
box so that rain could percolate through at the base so the mould on the
bottom, taken from a decaying willow, was always moist and sometimes
very wet. Amazingly the parent Cockatiels did not desert and five
chicks were reared. They all had such swollen tarsal joints that the
" corns " constricted the leg beneath the closed rings and the rings had
to be cut away. These were also the smallest Cockatiels bred that year.
With waterproof boxes I have not found chicks to have bad feet. Handfuls
of wood-shavings, recommended by some American breeders, seem to
delay nesting until they are removed or have been chewed down into
smaller pieces. I now use nothing but bare, wooden " concaves "
such as are used by Budgerigar breeders.
Conures-- Aratinga, " Nandayus ", " Leptositta ", Rhynchopsitta ,
Cyanoliseus , " Ognorhynchus &amp;apos;\Pyrrhura , " Microsittace "," Enicognathus "
Myiopsitta ,--many of the Macaws-- Ay a and Anodorhynchus --and
Caiques use the nest-box as a dormitory, by both sexes, even when not
breeding. These birds enter boxes readily--often within minutes of
putting boxes up. Roosting " Conures "--see above list--avoid any
soiling of the nest by retaining faeces over the night. However the
American parrakeets--\0x25A0" Amoropsitta ", Bolborhynchus, Brotogeris, and
probably " Psilopsiagon " and " Nannopsittaca " are less inclined to
roost in a nest-box. It often takes many weeks before they dare to enter
and when they do sleep within, unless incubating, they stay in the entrance
and are not " continent " so they foul the entrance. Parrotlets Forpus
probably are the same (my observation of these is rather equivocal--they
do not roost in a box unless about to breed; but they seem always to be
" house-trained "). All the other American parrots use the box solely
for breeding purposes, e.g. Amazona, Pionus, Pionopsitta. In the Old-world
some of the Red-billed group--Lovebirds and Psittacula parrots of both
sexes--may use the nest as a dormitory. With most Red-billed parrots
and New Zealand parrakeets it is the hens that sleep in the box when not
breeding, as may odd Rosellas Platycercus spp.. Lories sleep in pairs in
the box whether breeding or not. When nest-selecting or building
New-world parrots seem to engage one sex as much as another. In
Red-billed parrots the hen seems to do all of the work. In Broadtails the
male does nothing to the nest but seems to prefer to indicate the site.
Cockatoos have nesting as a joint venture.

All parrots lay white eggs. They are small for the size of the bird.
From my own measurements most eggs weigh so proportionately little
that it takes 12-15 to add up to the weight of the laying hen. They vary
somewhat in shape, even in parrots of the same species--generally they
are "oblong" rather than "egg-shaped". The average size of the
clutch varies from: one, two, three--up to seven, eight or nine, and is
roughly the same for each species. There seems to be a definite relation-
ship between the protein availability of the wild diet and the genetic size
of the clutch: Lories and Lorikeets (Loriinae) utilise pollen from flowers
as their major source of protein. Pollen granules have walls that are
most resistant to digestion and only a small proportion of this--theoretically
rich--source of protein can be extracted by the gut. The Cockatoos
that obtain much of their food from trees--as berries or nuts--lay one
egg--Palm Cockatoos, Black Cockatoos. Gang-gang Callocephalon
fimbriatum and the white island Cockatoos also lay smallish clutches.
Whereas those Australian cockatoos that feed from the ground and whose
breeding seems to be governed by the massive build-up of grains and
vegetable storage-organs--rhizomes, bulbs, corms, and tubers--following
irregular rainy periods, lay large clutches of three to five eggs.
A case for a relationship between the genetic determination of clutch
size being connected with food source is demonstrated by the Broadtails
(Platycercinae ). Swift parrakeets Lathamus discolor , depend largely on the
same flower-garnered diet as Lorikeets--supplemented with insects
(Forshaw 1969)--have three, four or rarely five eggs. New-Zealand
parrakeets have the most versatile feeding behaviour of the sub-family--
they have extended their omnivorous diet because they can scratch with
the feet like a domestic hen and turn over soil and vegetation. Many
potential-breeding females of other genera, e.g. African Greys Psittacus
erythacus and Asiatic Ringnecks Psittacula spp. scratch floor litter. This
is never done by males and is exclusive to females only in the breeding
season--though Holyoak (1972) suggests that this may not be seasonal--
New-Zealand parrakeets have emancipated this behaviour--which is that
adopted by females cleaning out nest cavities--from being exclusive to
nesting females for both sexes foot-scratch the litter.
In captivity an increase in the richness of the food supplied seems
capable of increasing slightly the general clutch size. Lories and Lorikeets
usually lay two eggs. Ken Russell (1971), when writing about his (first
reported) breeding of Perfect Lorikeets Trichoglossus euteles remarked
that the clutch of three eggs seemed to be unique in the avicultural
records. Though not reported this may not be so uncommon for captive
Trichoglossi. Mr. Ray Kyme has once had a clutch of three with his
Weber's ( Pers. com.) and Mr. A. Marques ( Pers. com.) found that three
eggs seemed invariable for his three breeding pairs of some sub-species of
T. haematod kept together in a breeding aviary. Mr. Russell's Perfects

laid three eggs with their second clutch (pers. com.). Animal protein--
milk--may be partially responsible for these large clutches.
Parrots are " determinate layers ", i.e. egg laying is not continued
beyond the regular clutch size if they are removed as laid. However
I have noted with my own parrots that when a hen starts to incubate with
the first or second egg then the clutch is small to average in size. However
when delayed until several eggs have been laid then the clutch is often
larger than average. Not uncommonly captive parrots lay abnormally
large clutches--far too large for the hen to cover--often no attempt is
made to brood and the process sometimes kills the hen.
Generally eggs are laid at two day intervals--plus or minus a few hours.
Forshaw (1969) says that Bourke's grass-parrakeet Neophema bourkei
lay on consecutive days. This is not so for " European " Bourkes and
Dr. Alan Lendon (in cor.) says that, in his experience, captive " Australian "
Bourke's lay on alternate days. If food is suddenly reduced in quantity
(personal observation of captive birds) an expected egg may not be
realised; if the food is then increased or restored egg laying is often
resumed. My surviving Black-headed Caique hen lays on alternate
days in the summer and every three days in the winter.
Incubation
(In order that I might more accurately determine the length of incubation
--which I take to be the shortest interval between laying and hatching--
I mark all eggs as laid with an indelible felt-tipped pen. Sometimes it
is not possible to mark eggs in sequence, when this is so all non-marked
eggs are given the same number. Weighing of eggs and chicks is done
with a " Pesola " spring balance). Incubation almost invariably starts
before completion of the clutch so that sequential hatching takes place.
Incubation is exclusive to the hen except for most Cockatoos (which,
of course, includes the Cockatiel), where the male, pigeonwise, takes over
most of the daytime incubation. Male Black Cockatoos of the genus
Calyptorhynchus are said not to incubate (see Forshaw 1969). This is
not invariable Mr. G. S. Mottershed, of Chester Zoo, tells me that his
breeding pair of Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoos C. f. funereus share duties
exactly as other Cockatoos. It is my impression that further observation
will show that shared incubation is the rule with all Cockatoos.
Before laying most parrot hens spend much time in the box brooding
or removing powdery litter and trying to line the cavity with splinters of
wood. Some hens seem unable to lay yet go quite broody and they will
" adopt " eggs and hatch them successfully.
Chicks
Incubation varies from 17 days in Forpus parrotlets. Budgerigars
18 days. Platycercines all seem to take 19 days, as do Cockatiels ( pers. ob.),
whereas Lories take about 26 days, Conures 27 days. The egg shells are

generally left in the nest cavity where they break down with the movements
of the birds. Some Cockatiels carry shells out of the nest to drop them
some way off. I have not noticed this with other parrots. When
hatched chicks are extremely helpless. Most are clothed with down yet
some of the Red-billed parrots are practically naked: Eclectus chicks
have short 1-2 mm. thick, orange-yellow bristles and Indian Ring-necks
(Smith 1972) are also " bald ". It is said by Marchant (i960) that
Forpus parrotlet chicks are naked--they are not. The sparse down that
covers them at birth gets somewhat abraded as they grow and by a week
some may be almost bald. Budgerigar chicks are downed in the egg but
hatch naked (Smith 1972). Some chicks are exceptionally woolly--
Kakas and Keas Nestor meridionalis and notabilis are very thickly downed.
New-Zealand parrakeets also have rather thick down for Broadtails.
Colour of down differs and is, I think, yellow in all Cockatoos and white
or pale grey in the New World parrots. The eyes of young parrots are
sealed for the first week or more of life. Like puppies, or kittens the ears
of New World parrots are sealed-off when hatched, the Old World
parrots have open earholes at hatching. Mr. Thomas Brossett, of Sweden,
at my request for some information kindly forwarded some excellent
photographs of the head of a week-old parrotlet chick and he notes in the
accompanying letter that though they have sealed ears the Senegal parrot
Poicephalus senegalensis chicks that he bred and photographed had open
ears--as do all the other chicks he has inspected. The earhole opens
after the eyes--say at a fortnight to three weeks old--for most American
parrots.
Another unique and seldom mentioned fact is that most Neotropical
parrots have a padded swelling on the upper and lower bill (Smith 1971).
This is barely perceptable in Forpus parrotlets on hatching and later is
merely indicated by the bill being just slightly wider than any Old World
parrot. Born as they are in the near or absolute dark parrot chicks have
pale yellow or white bills and all seem (except for Forpus parrotlets--where
it may be at too high a wave-length to be audible) to utter a tiny, thin note
when disturbed by movement. Chick sounds seem to be made with
expiration only--birds, as anyone knows who has listened to the incessant
song of canaries, can make noises both when inhaling and exhaling. I
believe that in the absolute or near-darkness of its nest chicks are fed by
the parents " homing " to this peeping noise. The adult bird when it
moves would cause the chick to call out. This causes the parent to take
its bill into her own. A slight pressure on the side of a chick's bill starts
it head jerking which makes the parent to regurgitate.
To assist in this feeding certain developments have taken place. Firstly
the nape of the chick's neck is enormously muscled and is quite the largest
visible muscle on hatching. Young parrot chicks are often said to be fed
on " crop milk " like a pigeon squab. A chick's bill (or come to that a
female parrot being fed by her mate) is held " inside " the parent's bill

and looks extremely " pigeon-wise but the food fed is not crop-milk.
They are fed on part digested, part softened, food direct from the parent's
crop and which probably includes secretions from the enlarged pro-
ventriculus--first stomach--of the hen (T. G. Taylor not published).
A very good description of an African Grey feeding a fostered Amazon
(Vane 1957) explains that very young chicks seem to get more " gravy "
than solid food. However post-mortem examination--and looking at the
contents of the transparent crops of baby parrots--convince me that the
largest part of the diet is regurgitated crop-softened food. There is a
need for grit--to enable the chick's gizzard to function correctly. If the
largest visible muscle is that of the neck, the largest absolute muscle is
that forming the gizzard of the infant which is about 5% of its total body
weight. At about the time that the chicks start to hatch male parrots may
be seen searching the ground for grit though at other times--especially
with arboreal parrots--they may never have been previously seen on the
floor. The male, except for Cockatoos, does not feed the chicks directly
for several days then he feeds the hen and then she feeds the chicks. Often
seeds or foods are taken that at other times are ignored such as millet
spray and bread and milk. Mortality is high in young chicks at the point
of hatching and again when the hen ceases to brood and goes foraging
with the male for food.
As the interval between successive eggs is usually two days, and
incubation generally starts before completion of the clutch a considerable
difference in size and development often exists between the eldest and
youngest chicks. The eldest may be half-grown in weight, with open,
seeing eyes capable of maintaining body heat, thickly covered with
sprouting feathers and able to run up to the parents, as they enter the box,
to solicit feeding. Sharing the nest--and available food--will be graduations
of younger chicks of which the last hatched is blind and completely
helpless and submerged completely under its larger brothers and sisters.
Yet when food is sufficient losses are not too frequent.
There is a quite noticeable difference in voice-tone between the different
ages of chicks. It is possible that the noise made by the very youngest
chicks has more " allure " than that of the eldest. Unless there was some
such system it is hard to understand how the parents can cope with such
a variety of different-sized babies. Parrot-chicks lie with the heads
interlocking so that if one is fed it must stimulate all the adjacent chicks--
perhaps this also helps even distribution of meals.
Two sorts of growth patterns are seen in parrots. The first--seen in
Budgerigars, Cockatiels and Broadtails is for a continual, though gradually
tapering, increase of weight until they fledge--when the chick weighs
less than the parents. The second is for a rapid increase in growth--
during which the chick may come to weigh more than the parents--
followed by a long period of stationary weight as the feathers grow then
a loss of weight just before they leave the box. This is seen in all the

American parrots that I have examined. Poor feeding delays fledging,
e.g. Cockatiels usually leave the nest when about five weeks old. If the
parents are poor feeders they may delay until a week older and if the
parents are good feeders they may fledge when four weeks old. Once they
leave the nest some parrots seem almost independent of the parents,
or can survive by feeding themselves; e.g. parrotlets, Broadtails, Lovebirds,
African Greys. Whereas some, such as Cockatoos, seem dependent on
the parents for very long periods. Caiques when fledged beg and when
being fed flap wings like baby sparrows. Young Cockatiels head-bob
when pleading to be fed.
After fledging some chicks return back to the box to sleep--Ringnecks,
Conures. Broadtails may for a day or so and then relinquish the habit.
Forpus parrotlets are said to be intolerant of their offspring once they
leave the box and are supposed to kill them--mine don't. Broadtails
soon become intolerant of their young. Red-bills and South American
parrots seem to form happy contented family parties.

(Anthropoides paradisea )

By J. O. D'eath, (Monken Hadley, Herts, England)
When the waterfowl collection here was re-established in 1946 on the
cessation of World War II it was my intention to extend same to include
the family Gruidae. However, owing to the limiting factors of space,
this original intention was unable to be fulfilled and only the following
species could be kept:-
Demoiselle (Anthropoides virgo), Stanley (A. paradisea ), West African
Crowned (Balearica pavonina), and East African Crowned ( B . begulorum).
In the space of 20 years or so casualties occurred but were always replaced
so that true pairs were maintained.
In 1967, when my friend and fellow member of the Avicultural Society
Tom Spence moved to Australia to take up the Directorship of the Perth
(W.A.) Zoo, he generously gave me an adult female Stanley Crane. This
bird was very " fixated " but in spite of this I decided to endeavour to
pair it. Accordingly after it had been with me for a year, I purchased in
October 1968 a very fine wild-caught male from a Continental dealer.
This bird was placed in an adjoining pen to the female and the birds
were familiar with each other for a period of six months. In the Spring
of 1969 they were put together in a pen measuring 45 m. x 20 m. which
also contained a small natural pond. The female tended to be aggresive
to the male, which was of shyer disposition anyhow.
Both birds were only lightly feather-clipped on both wings and not
permanently pinioned (this was intentional).
Displaying and " dancing " was noted from time to time from May
onwards.
I will now turn to the sequence of events that led to the successful
breeding of this species, the subject of these notes. In 1970 eggs were
laid on the following dates :-
16th May 29th May 1st June 22nd June
25th June 29th June 8th July 7th August
It will be seen that a total of eight eggs were laid. The majority were
removed and incubated under hens with the greatest care but all proved
clear. On two occasions a goose egg was substituted but within minutes
the female Stanley had eaten it. An egg painted to a fair representation
of the original egg was also given the same treatment. The female on
another occasion was allowed to incubate the sixth of her own eggs which
she did for a week, the male bird sharing duty with her. Unfortunately,
the female lays against the wire netting adjoining the path round the main
waterfowl collection and whilst disturbance is minimal, they are by

disposition shy birds and I suspect the slightest disturbance may have
some bearing on the egg-eating tendency. So much for the season 1970.
We now turn to 1971 and the dates on which eggs were laid is given
herewith. The asterisk denotes eggs which were subsequently fertile:-

The egg is elongated and heavily mottled with dark brown streaks and
blotches on a huffish brown background and weighs 190 gms. Measure-
ments varied slightly, but the average taken over twelve eggs indicates a
mean of 95-0x59-9 mm. Roberts in "Birds of S. Africa" quotes
93*0 x 59-9 as an average taken from 60 eggs. The shell is very hard but
I will comment on this under Hatching and Rearing. If one refers to the
two laying tables given above, one will note that it is difficult to extract
any definite pattern. One has always been given to understand that
Cranes in the wild state lay only two eggs, but in 1970 it will be noted
that eggs were laid on 22nd, 25th, 29th June respectively, approximately
at three-day intervals. There is really no definite evidence from my
own limited experience to establish any regular laying pattern and captive
conditions therefore probably cannot be compared with the wild.
I have one added note of interest in my record to the effect that on
27th June 1971 I was fortunate enough to actually witness, at close
quarters, the female Stanley laying. At 3.30 p.m. the bird was at the
nesting site and I was actually stroking her head when she emitted a loud
' purring ' sound and slowly lowered herself to the ground, whereupon the
egg was laid in about 30 secs. I immediately lifted the egg and the bird
showed no aggression.

All eggs in the 1971 season were removed immediately after laying and
put on the conventional sand-tray for 48 hours before being sat and turned
each day. The usual foster-mother was a Black Sumatra hen but actually
the first Crane was successfully reared by a Rhode Island. The incubation
period is 29/30 days. If the egg is water-tested 7/10 days before hatching,
one will get a clear indication of fertility. The usual method of candling is
ineffective, owing to the heavily marked shell. On " pipping " the egg
was immediately transferred to an incubator to avoid any possible crushing
or injury to the chick by the foster-mother. After hatching it was
returned. The egg-shell appears to be exceptionally thick and assistance
by breaking the shell was given to the emerging chick, although this may
not have been necessary.

After the drying-off period, the chick was put with the foster-mother
in the usual hen-coop inside a building. A small run was provided with
sacking as the floor covering. An Infra-Red lamp was suspended at a
height of 2 ft. above. For the first 2/3 days the chick is not very active.
A formula for a diet was worked out and the ingredients were as follows

The whole dried off to crumbly consistency with chick crumbs.
It was soon evident that the chick would not pick by itself in spite of
encouragement by the hen. This was not unexpected as in the wild
state the female Crane feeds the chick herself for several weeks. On the
third day after hatching the chick was induced to take small pieces of
food from a pair of tweezers and was fed every three hours. It also
started to drink from a fountain. For a few days live Mealworms were
also accepted in addition to the aforesaid diet. On the seventh day, the
chick was pinioned. It was not until three weeks that the chick started
to pick food for itself and at this stage it was moved out of doors into a
weather-proof house constructed of corrugated plastic measuring
10 ft. x 6 ft. Shortly after this it was noticed that the outside toe of the
right foot was showing a " splayed " condition. The simple remedy of
a match stick applied as a splint secured with adhesive tape was used and
proved a completely effective cure. I was a little surprised at this trouble
occurring as ample Calcium was present in the diet, but maybe some other
trace element is lacking. Growth is fairly quick and at five weeks
feathering is evident. The foster-mother was then removed.

At six weeks the meat diet was discontinued and the young Crane was
weaned on to grain and poultry pellets. A second Crane was likewise
reared and at 12 months they have not yet assumed full adult plumage.
They would appear to be a pair. On two occasions they were given a
proprietary game bird wormer as an additive in their drinking water as an
antidote to any possibility of gape-worm.

168 J. O. d'eATH--SOME NOTES ON BREEDING THE STANLEY CRANE
Summary
It would not appear that the rearing of the species presents any
unsurmountable difficulty, the main problem seems to be that one has to
be fortunate in having a breeding pair. Fertility running at less than
50% is not satisfactory and obviously there is a diet deficiency in the
breeding pair. I have observed on occasion my breeding pair catching
the odd field mouse or vole and eating caterpillars from plants. Their
diet in the wild is known and in captivity where Zoos and Bird Gardens
have greater facilities than the private breeder like myself, I would have
thought the introduction of such items as mice and day/old chicks into the
diet might well go some way to solving the problem. There is one point of
interest which has emerged from my experience with these Cranes which is
that they are completely hardy in our English climate and I have not found
it necessary to house them in the winter. They have withstood temperatures
as low as -- I5*F. A. F. Moody in his "Waterfowl &amp; Gamebirds in
Captivity (1932) " P. 174, says under the heading hardiness --" The most
delicate of the Cranes mentioned and a species that although capable of
enduring a dry cold if confined in a shed, cannot bear combined cold with
damp and requires to be housed under cover from early Autumn till late
Spring." The foregoing has definitely not been my experience. Finally,
in the light of my experience, I would say that bearing in mind our
variable climate it is impractical to let the birds attempt rearing their
own young and moreover, by removing the eggs one is obtaining greater
productivity and thereby increasing the prospect of rearing more than
two birds any one season.
Previous breedings
I am greatly indebted to the President of the Avicultural Society who
has researched on the subject and writes as follows
". . . a rare breeding and worthy of every congratulation. A Knowsley
bred Stanley was included in the Knowsley sale, 1851 (see catalogue
in the Library of Zoological Society, London). Mitchell (Zoo
Garden Guide, 1858, P. 13) says " at Knowsley broods of this
beautiful bird were hatched out on several occasions "--quite
possibly they were not reared.
Ezra had complete success in 1936. Young had been hatched in
the three previous years but none had lived longer than a couple of
weeks.
In 1936, however, one pair reared one young one and another
pair two. They were two and one month old at the date of the
account. Photographs are given of the young cranes.
For this success Ezra was awarded the A.S. medal (Avicultural
Magazine, 1936, pp. 272, 340).

C. J. O. HARRISON--RECORDS OF FIRST BREEDINGS IN BRITAIN 1 69
In his account Ezra says " There is a young one at the London
Zoo which is three weeks younger than mine and looks like being
reared
The Zoo bird died but one was reared in 1937 (Zoo reports).
I am also grateful to Mr. Peter Olney, Curator of Birds, London Zoo,
for the following information:- " In 1935 one hatched and died, in 1936
one hatched and died and in 1937 one was apparently reared. You
probably know the reference that it was first bred in the U.S.A. by
Mackeson. This comes from Crandall's list in the N.Y. Zoo Soc:
1917: 1449. There is also a reference to a Stanley X White-necked
Crane successfully reared at Woburn in the Avicultural Magazine,
1920, p. 167."
From the foregoing it would appear that A. paradisea has not been bred
in this country for 34 years.

Part i
By C. J. O. Harrison (Berkhamsted, Herts, England)
In 1926 Dr. E. Hopkinson published his " Records of birds bred in
captivity"; and from time to time in later years he published further
additions to this list of breeding in all parts of the world. These later
lists appeared in the Avicultural Magazine, the last being in 1944.
Apart from the information on parrots and birds of prey compiled by
A. A. Prestwich, we have had no more recent lists and it has become
increasingly time-consuming to trace evidence of what has or has not
been bred under captive conditions.
To assist enquiries to the Society concerning possible first breedings I
have been compiling a list of first breedings in Britain, and I hope to
offer, over a period, a brief checklist of references to such breedings.
These mostly refer to Avicultural Magazine records, but I have
included other references where these have come to my notice. The
task has not been made any easier by the changes in both English and
Latin names of species over the years, nor by the fact that what were
previously separate species have, in some instances, been combined into
single species.
I have not been able to allow this work the time I would like to have
devoted to it. I hope that readers will bring to my attention any errors
or omissions. I have used a reversed sequence of Peters' " Checklist
of birds of the world " for the family order.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRE-MATING
BEHAVIOUR IN THE ANDEAN EMERALD
AND THE GOLDEN-TAILED SAPPHIRE
HUMMINGBIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.992679925" page_id="56367388"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
By A. J. Mobbs (Walsall, Staffordshire, England)
I first witnessed the behaviour described in these notes, five years ago
in the Spring of 1967. A few months previously, I had moved to my
present address and, as I once again had sufficient room to keep humming-
birds (I had been without them for some months, due to lack of space),
I decided instead of housing them in cages as I had always done in the
past, I would attempt to keep them in a large indoor flight. Perhaps I
should point out that from the beginning, only hummers of Emerald size
and above were housed in this flight; tiny species, being difficult to
acquire, have always been housed in roomy cages.
The flight, 18 ft. long by 2 ft. 6 in. wide by 6 ft. 2 in. high, was duly
erected. Initially, four species of hummingbirds, a pair of Purple
Sunbirds ( Nectarinia asiatica ), a Yellow-naped Ixulus ( Ixulus flamcollis)
and a Goldcrest ( Regulus regulus), were released into the flight. Although
it does not concern the subject of these notes, perhaps I should mention
that the mixing of other species of birds with hummingbirds, proved
unsuccessful and two months after the initial stocking of the flight, all
but the hummers were removed.
The housing of hummingbirds in a communal flight has proved to be
entirely successful. I have not overstocked the flight, neither have I
understocked it. I consider six hummers to be the minimum and ten
the maximum.
One of the original occupants, which is still with me, is a male Andean
Emerald {Amazilia franciae ). Originally a pair were introduced to the
flight. The male, however, proved so aggressive towards the female
that I eventually parted with her. Since parting with this bird, I have
only housed one other female in the flight--a Black-tailed Trainbearer
(Lesbia victoriae )--as I have found it advisable to house batchelor males
only in such quarters.
Before parting with the female Emerald, the following observations
were made: both birds moulted out soon after purchase and a couple of
weeks before this was completed, the male commenced to sing. I believe
all members of the genus Amazilia are extremely vocal; the six species I
have observed regularly have been anyway. All the species have a
similar song pattern, which is usually heard while the bird is perched.
Occasionally, however, a bird will sing when in flight and also when
displaying. Prior to the pre-mating behaviour mentioned in these notes,
the Andean Emerald would sing more exuberantly than usual, the bill
being opened wide and the song poured out almost without a break

between each phase. This song is extremely loud, especially for a
hummingbird.
Although the male often sang when perched several feet from the female,
it was obvious the song was being directed at her. When the song
reached a certain pitch, the male would become most agitated. He
would then leave the perch and fly towards the female, wings beating
very much faster than in normal flight. If this initial burst of activity
was not enough to persuade the female to leave her perch, the male would
bombard her from all directions, uttering shrill cries of protest. It
would not take many seconds before such an onslaught persuaded the
female to leave her perch, and when she did, the male would chase after
her. At such times, it was always the female who tired first and when she
eventually settled on a perch again, the male would hover beneath her,
taking hold of her downy vent feathers in the tip of his bill, and would
then hang suspended for ten to twenty seconds at a time. This procedure
caused the female much distress and often she would leave the perch with
the male still suspended from her vent feathers. If this occurred, the
male would be towed along behind, until eventually the female became
exhausted and fell to the ground. More often than not, the male would
still persist in holding on to the female's vent feathers and both birds
would remain on the ground for a few seconds as if in a trance.
On occasions, I observed the female trying to dodge the male, or, if
he had already taken hold of her vent feathering, trying to dislodge him,
by flying into a plant (I have a number growing along the back wall of the
flight). Sometimes this ruse would be successful, but more often than
not, the male would still be in tow when the female emerged from the
plant.
At no time did I witness the male Emerald attempting to mate with the
female, and although I presumed the behaviour mentioned, to be a
prelude to mating, I could not be sure at the time.
These attacks on the female became more vicious as the male came into
full breeding condition and because of this, I reluctantly parted with the
female Emerald.
With the departure of the female, the male turned his attentions to other
members of the flight. He was unable to intimidate any of these, however,
and for a time peace reigned. In fact it wasn't until I purchased a male
Long-billed Starthroat (Heliomaster longirostris ), that I again witnessed
the pre-mating behaviour of the Andean Emerald.
Long-billed Starthroats, although largish hummingbirds, are most
docile and rarely attack other hummers. The Andean Emerald provoked
the Starthroat from the beginning and although the latter seemed able to
defend itself at first, it was not long before the Emerald dominated it to
such an extent as to make its life a misery. Often my wife or I would
enter the birdroom and find the Starthroat clinging to the wire netting
with the Emerald attacking it unmercifully. This could not be allowed

to continue and I parted with the Starthroat, albeit reluctantly, as I am
particularly fond of this species, finding it to have great character and a
quiet form of beauty.
Before parting with the Starthroat, the following observations were
made: The Andean Emerald chased the Starthroat in the same way as it
had the female Emerald. The Starthroat, not being so agile, soon became
exhausted and was forced to settle either on a perch or on the wire netting
Directly this happened, the Emerald would take hold of the Starthroat's
vent feathers. After being suspended from these feathers for ten to
20 seconds, the Emerald would fly up on to the Starthroat's back and go
through the actions of mating. After attempting to mate, the Emerald
would fly to a perch and commence to preen.
Almost three years were to pass before I once again witnessed this
behaviour in the Andean Emerald, In October, 1971, I purchased an
immature male Golden-tailed Sapphire (Chrysuronia oenone), and an adult
male Long-billed Starthroat. Both birds were well-fleshed and free
from disease and were released into the flight almost immediately. The
Starthroat was unable to fly more than a few feet at a time, due to the
two outer primaries on each wing being badly frayed. I had my doubts
as to whether this bird would be suitable for inclusion in the flight until it
had moulted. It moved about reasonably well, however, and as it
seemed content, I allowed it to remain. I fully expected the Andean
Emerald to cause a certain amount of trouble, but as he was now at least
five years old, I hoped he would not prove quite so vicious as when
first purchased. Also placing two new additions into the flight, would
I hoped, confuse the Emerald somewhat.
The Sapphire proved to be extremely agile and more often than not
was able to out-fly the ageing Emerald. If the Sapphire did become
fatigued, it would take refuge in a plant and the Emerald would then give
up the chase.
As the Starthroat was unable to fly correctly, the Emerald naturally paid
more attention to this bird than the Sapphire. The Emerald did not
become so agitated with the Starthroat as it has done with the female
Emerald, and because of this, would perform the pre-mating behaviour in
a more leasurely manner. As the Starthroat was loath to take to the wing
unless it became absolutely necessary, the Emerald was able to hover
beneath it for three or four seconds before taking hold of the vent feathers.
The Emerald would, on occasions, peck at the Starthroat's vent a number
of times before taking hold of the downy feathers. Once it did take hold
of these feathers, it would hang motionless, with wings opened wide, and
would sing a subdued version of the normal type song. After fifteen seconds
or so, the Emerald would release its hold on the Starthroat's feathers and
fly up on to the bird's back and attempt to mate. Occasionally, while
attempting to mate, the Emerald would take hold of the Starthroat's head
or neck feathers.

176 A. J. MOBBS--PRE-MATING BEHAVIOUR IN HUMMINGBIRDS
During the procedure described, the Starthroat usually remained
passive, although on occasions it did attempt to fend off the Emerald with
its bill. My wife did on one occasion, witness the Starthroat taking hold
of the Emerald by the throat feathers. Only once (to date) has the Emerald
become so agitated as to turn vicious with the Starthroat. When this
occurred, the Emerald pierced the latter's throat, drawing a considerable
amount of blood.
At the time of writing, the male Golden-tailed Sapphire, has been
performing the pre-mating behaviour described for the Andean Emerald,
for a week or so. As already mentioned, this Sapphire was immature when
purchased. Shortly afterwards, it commenced to moult into adult
plumage and a couple of weeks before this was attained, I observed the
Sapphire attempting to mate with the Starthroat. At first the Sapphire
did not take hold of the Starthroat's vent feathers, but would fly directly
on to the latter's back. The Sapphire now follows the behaviour pattern
already described, with one slight difference. After attempting to mate
with another hummer, the Emerald has always retired to a perch and com-
menced to preen; the Sapphire will again take hold of its victim's vent
feathers after an attempted mating and will in fact go through this pro-
cedure a number of times before retiring to a perch to preen.
The tables have now been turned on the Emerald as the Sapphire has
on occasions, turned its attentions towards the former as well as to the
Starthroat. The Sapphire has in fact occasionally succeeded in suspending
itself from the Emerald's vent feathers, much to the latter's disgust!
Both the Emerald and the Sapphire have on occasions turned their
attentions to other members of the flight. They have not, as far as I am
aware, succeeded in attaching themselves to the vent feathers of these
birds, however.
As the Emerald was not seen to attempt a mating with the female
Emerald and yet was seen to do so with both Starthroat's; could it be
that the " victim " has to be passive, before a mating is attempted? This
theory could in fact be correct, as I have witnessed both the Sapphire and
the Emerald attempt a mating with a hummer which has been at rest.

SOME NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF CRANES
AT THE COTSWOLD WILD LIFE PARK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983209825" page_id="56367394"  page_num="177" year="" vol="">
By Brian C. Sinfield (Director of the Cotswold Wild Life Park,
Burford, Oxfordshire, England)
Four species of cranes, Sams, Black-necked Crowned, Demoiselle,
and Lilford are kept at the Park. The oldest residents have been here
only z\ years. It was therefore quite exciting when two of our group of
eight Demoiselles paired up. I estimated their ages to be about three
years as they came to us very young. On April 21st this year an egg was
laid in a wooded clearing in a corner of their enclosure, about 30 yards
from the public path. The enclosure itself contains a group of both
Demoiselle and Crowned cranes and measures about ij acres in extent.
Part of it is wooded, part open. Apart from the fact that all the birds are
pinioned they live virtually natural lives.
Both birds became extremely aggressive, attacking everything that came
within their twenty yard territory. They would flatten themselves
against the ground, wings spread out and forward, and attack in this
manner. Occasionally they would launch into their " dance ", a display
of leaping about throwing twigs and pieces of turf in the air and stabbing
the earth with their sharp beaks. Often this preceeded their more
aggressive manoeuvres. The second egg was laid almost two days later.
They were greyish-brown in colour and slightly blotched. The first chick
hatched on 19th May the second on the 21st. The incubation period
was therefore 29 days. The chicks appeared to be no more than 5 in.
in height. You could just see their little yellow heads above the grass as
they stumbled after their parents. On 21st May we noticed one of the
chicks sitting on its own with the parents several yards away. We decided
to leave it alone for half an hour in the hope that Mum and Dad would
not desert it, but when we returned half an hour later there was no
sign of the baby. It was eventually discovered some yards away having
been killed and half eaten by a squirrel. The remaining chick was still
well under the protective wing of its parents but on 24th May this chick
too was noticeably absent, and was never found. Although all of this
was very disappointing we knew at least that we had a good breeding pair.
I think that probably both the babies were initially weakened by the wet
cold weather that followed some days after they were hatched. Also the
grass was rather long and continually wet.
In late June the Sarus cranes which share a paddock with Llama and
Rhea showed signs that they were going to nest. In their case a definite
shallow nest of bits of twig, feathers and dried grass was fashioned a foot
away from their pool in exactly the same spot as the year before. At that
time they laid two eggs, later found to be infertile.

178 B. C. SINFIELD--SOME NOTES ON THE BREEDING OF CRANES
We waited expectantly and then on 26th June the first egg was laid,
and two days later a second. It is interesting here to note that during the
incubation period the previous year the hen bird turned savagely on the
cock. In fact she chased him over the fence no less than three times.
We were therefore forced to remove him for the duration. The hen then
sat the incubation out on her own. We expected the same thing to
happen this year, but instead they both behaved perfectly, swapping the
incubation between them.
Since the weather was rather unsettled we decided to remove one egg
after about two weeks, and place it in an incubator. The remaining egg
duly hatched 29 days later, the one in the incubator never did. The
chick was about seven or eight inches in height and pale buff in colour.
The parents now spent most of the day grubbing about for worms and
insects. We decided to supplement their normal feed of mixed grain,
chopped veg. and day old chicks with maggots and mealworms. They
were often seen feeding the baby with insects and worms, probably too
with some regurgitated matter, but we could not get close enough to
see.
As usual following the birth of cranes in this country, we had some
very cold wet weather. This was about a week after hatching. It
stayed wet for some days and I had fears that the chick would not survive.
However I decided to leave it with the parents. The grass in the paddock
had been cropped short by the Llamas, which meant that the chick was
not wading through wet grass as was the case with the Demoiselles.
The chick did not appear to have suffered any ill effects from the wetting
at all, and was soon grubbing about in the earth alongside its parents.
At about the second week we sprinkled worming powder on the food, in
the hope that the chick would manage to get some. If one tried to
approach the baby the parents set up an awful din and attacked
savagely. At the time of writing (30th August) the chick is a little over
two months old and about 18 in. in height.
So far neither the Lilford nor the Crowned Cranes have shown any
sign of breeding.
We discovered an interesting phenomenen in our Crowned Cranes
following the death of one of them. In this bird an exceptionally long beak
growth was found and the lower mandible had broken off leaving the
poor bird no way in which it could feed. While this in itself in an old
bird is not extraordinary, indeed it is quite commonplace in toucans and
hornbills, we were rather surprised when rounding up all the others we
discovered that every bird (Crowned Cranes) had an overgrown beak,
both mandibles in some of them were over six inches long.
I can only assume that the ground must be too soft for them, although
if this were the case surely the other three species would have shown a
similar deformity? I have kept cranes for many years on similar ground
and never had this kind of trouble before. The mandibles were duly

A. J. Mobbs writes: " Housed in one of the small indoor flights at the
Botanical Gardens, Edgbaston, Birmingham are two birds which to say
the least are very strange companions. They are a Senegal Parrot and
a Speckled Mousebird. The parrot is in excellent condition and the
mousebird appears to be extremely healthy. Featherwise, however it
leaves much to be desired. This is most probably due to the habit this
species has of spending much of its time hanging from the wire netting.

Although Bluewinged Grass Parrakeets are generally reliable breeders
in captivity, they usually produce small broods and are not often double
brooded. The breeding activities of one of my pairs is, therefore, worth
recording. The cock was hatched in 1965 and the hen in 1966. Their
breeding record is as follows

All of these youngsters have developed into excellent specimens. Many
of those which I have retained have bred successfully but not nearly so
prolifically as their parents. The pair show no signs of growing old
although this year is the first in which they have produced only one
clutch of eggs.
Several Iris Lorrikeets (Psitteuteles iris) have recently been imported
into Great Britain. I have not seen any of the specimens which have been
offered for sale but those in the San Diego Zoo, which I visited in July,
were most attractive. It is smaller and slimmer than a Lovebird, mainly
green with striking red, yellow and blue areas on the head. It has been
bred in the San Diego Zoo and the parents and their offspring were on
view at the time of my visit. I hope that the opportunity to establish this
desirable species as an aviary strain will not be wasted. J. R. H.

DUETTING AND ANTIPHONAL SONG IN BIRDS ITS EXTENT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987390853658537" page_id="56367398"  page_num="181" year="" vol="">
AND SIGNIFICANCE. By W. H. Thorpe in collaboration with
J. Hall Craggs, B. and T. Hooker and R. Hutchinson. Leiden.:
E. J. Brill, 1972. Price 96 Dutch guilders.
The phenomenon of duetting-either simultaneous or alternating song-
between the mated male and female is known to occur in 32 or more
families involving approximately 120 species of which nearly 100 are
tropical. There are some nine families in which this reaches its highest
development, with alternating or precise union song between the paired
male and female, used even when the birds cannot see each other. The
result of this is that distance, intervening vegetation, etc., offer little or no
obstacle to mutual recognition and the maintenance of contact. The
nine families are: Megapodidae, Phasianidae, Rallidae, Formicariidae,
Troglodytidae, Turdidae, Sylviidae, Laniidae, and Meliphagidae.
The author has studied the phenomenon in certain of these families
starting with the Laniidae, with special reference to the species of Lanarius
and their geographical distribution and ethological and ecological
isolation. Records of musical examples were taken in the wild in various
localities and then analysed, giving the number of notes, duration, semi-
tones, Herz frequency, and remarks on the duets, which sometimes
include a third bird duplicating note 1 or notes 1-3. The results are
given in tabular form the first table concerning Laniarius aethiopicus major
of the Nakuru-Dundori population with 102 records,; a second table of
22 records of the same species in Uganda; a third with 24 examples of the
Kitale-Kaibos-Kapenguria population; and further tables dealing with
three species or subspecies of Laniarius. Musical examples are then
given of duet patterns of various species of Laniarius followed by a detailed
discussion of the seven races of L. aethiopicus , the Tropical Boubou
Shrike.
Sketch maps are given showing areas where continuous tape recordings
were taken to show the interchange between territories, without any pair
trespassing on another's home ground. Where the country is suitable
and birds are in fair numbers these territories tend to be rounded or
oval and average about seven acres in extent. Cases of trio and quartet
singing may occur at territorial boundaries--as a result of aggressive
encounters between mated pairs.
Experimental studies were then carried out on Laniarius aethiopicus y
some hand reared and others wild caught, maintained in tropical aviaries.
The results confirmed field observations that the birds have exact control
of the timing, pitch, and overall rate at which they produce their duets.
The pitch control was found to be accurate to a semitone and even
consistent to a quartertone. The aviary work confirmed the view that

one of the major functions of the imitative ability of the birds was to
establish and strengthen social bonds.
Succeeding chapters deal with other species of Laniarius and musical
aspects of the vocalizations of L. aethiopicus and L. ferrugineus . Finally
the behaviour of Robin Chats and Grass Warblers is also considered.
This comprehensive and detailed account of one of the more interesting
aspects of bird behaviour summarizes the available information on the
subject in addition to providing a wealth of material for future studies.
It is likely long to remain the standard work on the subject.

R. Guttinger and Heinrich Bregulla. Bonner Zoologische Mono-
graphien, No. 2, 1972. Price 35 DM.
A most interesting and comprehensive monograph on the parrot
finches, based on detailed studies of their taxonomy, anatomy, and
behaviour both in the wild and in captivity. A " must " for any serious
aviculturist who is interested in these birds and who can read German.
Among the very numerous illustrations are several photos of the natural
habitats of these birds, or perhaps one should sometimes say " un-natural ",
as many of them show man-altered areas, to which some species of parrot
finches have successfully adapted. There is also a coloured plate showing
all species, either " full figure " or in some cases " head and neck " only,
and a colour photograph of Royal Parrot Finches feeding in a fig tree.
A great deal of information as to the foods taken by parrot finches, both
in the wild and in captivity are given.
To pick out just a few currants to indicate how much there is of interest
in this very rich cake:
Little is recorded of the behaviour of the Pintailed Nonpareil, Erythrura
prasina in the wild, in spite of its being so extensively collected and
captured. (P. 27). Fruit doves of the genus Ptilinopus appear to be
serious food competitors with those parrot finches, such as the Royal
Parrot Finch, that specialise in feeding on the seeds of wild figs, driving
them persistently away from fruiting trees, (pp. 68 and 72). As in
Britain, so in such exotic islands as Viti Levu, the native trees are being
deliberately destroyed in order to plant exotic conifers (P. 73). The
Red-headed Parrot Finch breeds well at first in captivity but after a few
generations the fertility rate soon declines. The reason for this is not
known (P. 121). This species is, fortunately, still common and widespread
in New Caledonia where it adapts well to man's alteration of the environ-
ment. It is considered possible however, that the [past and continuing]

introduction of exotic species--The Chestnut-breasted Munia and
Common Waxbill are already well established and the (Red?) Squirrel
has recently been introduced--might ultimately endanger it (P. 52).
The Royal Parrot Finch is threatened by the introduction of bird malaria
and its carrier, the mosquito Culex pipiens (P. 69).
On a lighter note; Hell may have no fury like a woman scorned, but the
female parrot finches of the Melanesian islands show a comparable reaction
to that of their human counterparts in this situation (P. 125).
The Gouldian Finch is not included in Erythrura but in the monotypic
genus Chloebia ; it appears to have as much in common with the munias,
Lonchura , as with the parrot finches.

BIRD-KEEPING AND BIRDCAGES: A HISTORY. By Sonia

Birds have been kept by man since the dawn of civilisation, first as
assistants in hunting and the control of vermin and subsequently as pets.
In many cultures, apart from sacred-birds kept in temples, trained or
tamed birds were maintained in royal menageries even before birds were
kept for food. The author describes the aesthetics and mechanics of
birdcage and aviary design ranging from at least one knowledgeable
fancier in Noah to the Snowdon aviary in the London Zoo.
The first chapter in this splendidly illustrated history deals with ancient
times when birds of curiosity and interest were kept in many civilisations
including the ancient Egyptians, Chinese and the Greek and Roman
Empires. An example of a birdcage in Byzantine tiles very closely
resembles a modern parrot cage and aviaries were a common feature in
Roman villas.
The second chapter deals with Renaissance exoticism and after, which
created an ideal climate for the spread of aviculture. The domes which
embellished homes and mosques were reproduced in Moorish ball-topped
birdcages, creating a pattern which exists to this day. The opening
up of new trade routes and the discovery of new countries added to the
list of exotic species of birds that rich aviary owners wished to acquire and
resulted in the development of more elaborate avairies many of which are
illustrated. Then came the age of elegance with bird keeping on a grand
scale developed with the changing fashions in landscape gardening in the
eighteenth century and many examples are described and figured.
The rise of the fancy dates from the middle of the eighteenth century
and especially the beginning of the nineteenth, and when the London
Zoo opened in 1828 birds were already an important feature and people
were prepared to pay handsomely to see a bird show. Elaborate birdcages

and aviaries were designed ranging from Chippendale style and porcelain
cages to elaborate aviaries. The boom in budgerigars and the develop-
ment of pleasure gardens and zoos in recent times have all contributed
to a great variety in the designs of cages. Since World War II a cage-
collecting craze has developed and illustrations are given of some of the
more grotesque examples and current prices.
This attractive book concludes with a county-by-county guide to 120
establishments in the British Isles of interest to bird-lovers.

BIRD STUDY. By Andrew J. Berger. London: Constable &amp; Co,
1972. Price #2.
This is a reprint, in a practical form, of a work first published in 1961.
Dr. Berger is an excellent teacher of ornithology, now at the University of
Hawaii, and this book is a general treatment of all aspects of bird knowledge
written for students, but it also constitutes a useful guide for all bird lovers.
Eleven chapters deal with the introduction of the bird, field identification,
bird habits, migration, behaviour, song, courtship and nest-building,
eggs and young, structure and function, conservation and systematics;
all is well treated and accurate, if naturally rather condensed. The section
on systematics particularly is a little incomplete, though generally sound.

BREEDING OF THE BLACK REDSTART
(PHOENICURUS OCHRURUS L.) IN GERMANY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.858388533333333" page_id="56367401"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
In July 1972 Mr. O. Bielefeldt, Liibeck, an aviculturist who specialises in keeping
European birds (which is permitted to some extent in Germany) told me that his
Black Redstarts ( Phoenicurus ochruros L.) had just successfully reared two youngsters.
The Redstarts shared a densely planted aviary (ca. 4 X 2 X 2.5 m.) with a Nuthatch
(Sitta europea ), two Wheatears ( Oenanthe oenanthe ), a pair of White Wagtails
(Motacilla alba alba), which had also been making attempts to breed this year, and
a pair of Quail ( Coturnix coturnix). The nest was built in a wooden nest-box,
which was half open in front. The diet was a soft-billed bird-food, consisting of
egg, a sort of Madeira cake, carrots and dried insects together with plenty of
mealworms. Unfortunately Mr. Bielefeldt could not observe the process of
breeding and rearing and did not make any notes.
Black Redstarts are not often kept in Germany and very infrequently bred; the
last account of successful rearing being written by P. Ganzlin before World War II,
and published in Die Gefiederte Welt, 1937.

FURTHER NOTES ON THE BILL COLOUR OF THE WHITE-BELLIED
GO-AWAY BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996747" page_id="56367402"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
In the January-February issue of the Magazine, (pp. 37-38,) I commented on
the likelihood of the bill colour of the White-bellied Go-away Bird, Corythaixiodes
leucogaster , providing a means of sexing this species. My comment was prompted
by the capture of two pairs who had mated-up in the wild, for in both instances one
bird of the pair possessed a dark, virtually black bill and the other a greenish-
yellow bill.
Recently I visited the National Museum, Nairobi, where I was able to examine
specimens of this species. Of the skins in this collection, eleven with black bills
were labelled as being male, while two were labelled female. On the other hand,
six with greenish-yellow bills were shown as being female, and one as being a male.
One skin had no sex indicated on its label. Perhaps the most interesting of all was
a specimen with the plumage wholly snowy-white; this was labelled as being a
female and the bill was described as being pink, tinged green.
Lack of time prevented me from taking measurements and noting the locality
where individual specimens were collected to investigate whether either are relevant
to the issue. Thus my theory still remains inconclusive.
Incidentally, half-a-dozen live nestlings of this species that I have been able to
examine have all possessed black bills.

INTER-SPECIFIC PREENING OF CUTTHROAT AND MALABAR
STARLING WITH QUAIL
I was interested in Mr. Trollope's note on interactions of other species with
Painted Quail ( Avicult. Mag. 74 j 11) since I have noted on numerous occasions a
cock Cutthroat, Amadina fasciata, preening a hen Japanese Quail, Coturnixjaponica.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.949764636363636" page_id="56367402"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
I would mention that the Cutthroat did not have a mate, and that the Japanese
Quail consisted of three hens and a cock. The preening was not mutual, but at
times the Cutthroat clumped with two or more of the hens. At other times
it displayed to the hen quail, and also tried what looked rather like an attempt to
mate with it, being taken for short rides around the aviary on the back of the quail.
I have also observed a cock Malabar Starling, Sturnus malabaricus , preen and
clump with a Japanese Quail. The starling also lowered its head to solicit preening,
but this was not returned. The starling was at this time a solitary bird, but although
since then I have obtained a mate for it the pair has been moved to another aviary,
and I have not been able to observe if preening took place again.

Both Mr. Lambert's observations given above, and those of Mr. Ellis {Avicult.
Mag. 78 / 38) on a similar association between a Negro Finch, Nigrita canicapilla ,
and a Green Pigeon, Treron australis , refer to the smaller bird resting on the back
of the larger one. During earlier studies by Desmond Morris of Java Sparrows,
Padda oryzivora , roosting with Barbary Doves, Streptopelia roseogrisea, he found
the smaller bird often moved from side to side over the back of the larger one.
He considered that the smaller bird regarded the much larger one as the equivalent
of a clumping and resting group of its own species. In such a group lined up on a
perch the outside birds will from time to time run along the backs of the others and
squeeze down in a gap in the middle of the group. Morris suggested that the
smaller bird on the back of the large one was looking for a non-existent " middle
gap ' ' on the back into which it could descend. {Assistant Editor).

(Cyanerpes cyaneusx Tangora nigrocincta franciscae)
By Jean Delacour (Cleres, France)
As a complement to my previous note (Avicultural Magazine, 1972,
p. 48), Mr. Kenton C. Lint, Curator of Birds at the San Diego Zoo,
writes as follows:
"The parent birds nested in a hanging redwood basket 12 inches square
containing a fuchsia plant. A small open cup nest was constructed by the
hen Masked Tanager. Materials used in the nest consisted of dog hair,
sheep wool and pieces of white, yellow and red yarn placed in the aviary
for nest building. The completed nest measured 100 mm. across the
top and was about 70 mm. deep, the central depression being quite deep,
sufficient for the female to be completely concealed except for her head.
The clutch consisted of two eggs, white in colour with brown splotches,
typical Tanager eggs.
"Incubation did not start until the second egg was laid. An incubation
period of 13-14 days was recorded for the two chicks. The first chick
hatched 13th June 1970, the second chick hatched 14th June 1970. At
six days of age the eyes were open and the chicks were fed regularly by
both parent birds. We observed the parents feeding only insectivorous
food to the chicks for the first seven days after hatching. Mealworms
and drosophila were fed exclusively to the chicks at this early age. When
eight days old both parent birds were seen to collect other food at the
regular softfood container in the aviary and carry this food to the nestlings.
The regular softfood stainless steel pans in the aviary contain bread and
milk, raisins (soaked overnight in water), diced apples, bananas, oranges,
blueberries, hard-boiled egg yolks and boiled rice sweetened with Karo
syrup. Diced grapes are also fed in season to the Tanagers.

"The two chicks grew nicely and left their nest at 20 days of age. The
parent birds followed the chicks wherever they perched and continued
to feed and guard them from other birds in the aviary. When 30 days
old the chicks were observed feeding for the first time with the mother
at the regular feeding pans.
"A second clutch of eggs was laid 17-18th August, also in 1970 by the
same pair of birds. The two eggs hatched 20-31st August, again recording
an incubation period of 13 and 14 days respectively.
"With these notes we wish to confirm Dr. Delacour's view that inter-
specific hybridisation may occur successfully between Coerebidae and
Thraupidae which has been much disputed in the field of ornithology."
It now appears that the female Masked Tanager belongs to the sub-
species franciscae , not fanny , which is very slightly different and lives a
little further north (Costa Rica).
The buffy colour on the throat of the hybrid, as well as its white belly,
reminds one of the female's feather pattern, whereas the pale blue crown
recalls that of the male. Curiously, the black saddle of both parents is
lacking.
In view of this breeding of Sugar-Bird and Tanager it should perhaps
be pointed out that in the most recent arrangement of these species, in
Peter's "Checklist of Birds of the World" vol. 14, (1968) edited by R. A.
Paynter, the Coerebidae has disappeared. The genera Diglossa , Chloro-
phanes , Iridophanes , Cyanerpes, Dacnis , Hemidacnis , Xenodacnis, Oreomanes
and Euneornis are all put with the Tanagers in the subfamily Thraupinae of
the Emberizidae. The remaining genera Coereba and Conirostrum (in-
cluding Ateleodacnis ) have been placed provisionally with the American
Warblers, Parulidae, although Skutch has suggested that the former is
so distinct that it might be regarded as a monotypic family and the lat-
ter might be related to the typical buntings. The San Diego breeding
illustrates how hybridisation can at times help to confirm suspected
taxonomic relationships.

(Panurus biarmicus)
By M. I. Barber (Ipswich, Suffolk, England)
The pair of Bearded Reedlings, Panurus biarmicus , were imported from
the continent, and to persuade them to breed I gave them aviary conditions
similar to their natural environment, but with some differences. The
aviary was planted and designed to produce as much live food as possible.
It measured 15 ft. X 8 ft. X 8 ft. and was constructed with no solid shelter
overhead or around the sides. I feel that although such shelter has its
advantages it also has a disadvantage in that birds may become upset at
any disturbance of which they cannot see the cause; whereas in an aviary
open all round they can become used to the presence of neighbours, my
dogs, and the sight of other birds overhead, and if alarmed can go to cover
in the plants growing in the aviary, as they would in the wild. This
appeared to be the right idea, since the birds appeared to feel secure in the
reed-bed and thick vegetation which I provided, and seemed completely
at home in the environment I had created.
The vegetation cover took up three-quarters of the aviary flight and
consisted of a pear-shaped reed-bed about 12 ft. long, 6 ft. at its widest,
narrowing to 2-3 ft.; with a cavity 12-14 in. deep filled with mud from a
marsh and planted mainly with reeds but also with meadowsweet and other
marsh flowering plants, a large clump of nettles, spear-grass, and three
clumps of Pampas Grass which I added to thicken the cover. It also
contained a two-year-old elderberry and a large blackcurrant bush, with
branches spreading into the reeds. To encourage insects I also added a
large heap of horse manure, partly in the nettles and partly in the open.
This required to be kept moist. The combination of mud, water, manure*
and heavy plant growth appeared to hold insects and encourage them ta
breed and provide live food.
Because of the vegetation the amount of room I had for movement
within the flight was a short path on one side of the reed-bed and a
small area just by the door where I could feed the birds. I had no need
to go right into the flight and all I would do was to open the door, place
the food inside and close the door again; and in this way I only disturbed
the birds once or twice a day.
Before describing the nesting it may be of interest to record the various
bits of behaviour that I witnessed with this pair, since for those who have
not watched these birds in the wild and do not know of their behaviour
apart from the little information in most books such observations may help
to indicate the build-up prior to nesting.
I did not know that the pair were nesting, and the first intimation I had
that the pair were going to nest was on the 16th June when, as I approached

the flight, I noticed the cock looking down into the reeds. This may not
sound unusual but he was so still, not moving a feather, and concentrating
so much that he did not notice me moving nearer, that I thought something
was wrong. He stayed frozen in this position for at least three or four
minutes, and I was about to investigate when he started calling, and I
have hardly ever seen a bird so excited. He started to hop up and down
and call for all he was worth. I really thought something was wrong
and with heart beginning to beat heavily I started forward to enter the
aviary but then saw the reeds move and the hen came out.
She went up to the cock who by this time was wildly excited. First
he fluffed up into a ball, then crouched low on the perch, and spread his
wing and tail at the same time bowing towards the hen. He then hopped
over the hen and back again. This he did three or four times. The
hen was just preening herself and shaking her feathers. The cock then
saw me and gave the alarm and they both took cover. From that time on
I had a feeling that they might be nesting and decided to watch more
closely.
For the next few days I didn't see much of the pair but on two occasions
I did see the cock hopping over the hen. By the 21st June I saw more of
the cock than I did of the hen, and on some days never saw either of them.
The feeling that they were nesting began to grow and on the 22nd I had
a morning off from work and decided to sit and watch. I did so for about
one and a half hours and noticed that the pair seemed to be changing
places, like a shift. On 25th June when I visited my friend Frank Meaden
I told him my observations and he confirmed that the cock shared in
incubation.
Another thing I observed was the pair preening each other. Perched
together they were scratching and cleaning their plumage. The hen
stretched upwards and the cock moved closer and did the same. They
both fluffed out the feathers of the head, and at almost the same moment
they tilted their heads as if showing each other the sides of their faces.
The cock then started to preen the side of the hen's face and she in turn
did the same to him. They continued this for some five minutes. It was
pleasing to see the two birds behaving in such an affectionate way towards
each other.
Their general behaviour did not change for several days; and on 28th
June a friend suggested that I should have a look. With the aid of a cane
I parted the reeds a little where I had seen the pair going down and sure
enough I found their nest, which was built about three or four inches
above the water level in the reeds and contained four eggs. I did not
stay long for fear of disturbing the birds. For me this was the greatest
thing to have happened since I started to breed birds. I would mention
that the pair take turns at incubation for very short periods, so much so
that at first I thought they had deserted the nest.
I notified various people of what had happened but did not look again

until 4th July when I noticed in the morning a piece of eggshell on the
aviary floor. When I returned from work in the evening I went to feed
them and saw both adults out of the reeds. I decided to go in, for since
I knew where the nest was a quick look would do no harm. I kept an eye
on the adults, who became a little upset as I approached the nest. I did
not stay long, but saw three young and one egg.
I cannot express in words my excitement at that moment, and only
those who have done the same will know how I felt. My task now was to
get those young out of the nest and reared successfully. I started off
by offering Wax Moth larvae; and very small mealworms about one-eighth
to three-quarters of an inch long, sifted out of some cultures which I had.
I took as many Wax Moth as I could spare without destroying the whole
culture, and then turned to the Flour Moth larvae which were breeding
plentifully in with the mealworms. Fly maggots and pupae were also
given, the maggots being dusted with Yionate and Calcium Lactate.
I did not see what insects were selected but only made sure that they were
taking them to the nest.
The adults entered the nest by one route and left by another, entering
near the nest but emerging some distance away. The droppings of the
young were carried to the side of the aviary and wiped off on the vertical
aviary wire.
Since I work on shifts on different days of the week this gave me the
opportunity to feed the birds more often. I gave the food three times a
day. I had arranged to have a week off work and during this week I fed
the birds five times a day, giving the food in smaller quantities. I had
noticed that each time I gave more food the birds came and carried some
straight to the nest, and I hoped by feeding more often to encourage them
to keep feeding the young.
I continued this feeding but also offered whiteworms sprayed with
Abidec multi-vitamins. I also shook greenflies (Aphis) on to the food
tray and found that they took these readily; and after a few days I found
that they were not taking the whiteworms but only the greenflies. I got
in touch with Frank Meaden the day the young hatched and asked his
advice on any additional food. At his suggestion I picked out white
mealworms which had just shed their skins and were soft, and also the
soft mealworm pupae; and later, with his help, I obtained some Wood Ant
pupae which were taken readily by the birds.
By the 8th July when all seemed to be going well I took another look
and found I still had three young and an unhatched egg. Although I was
tempted to look every day I did not do so for fear of losing them. On
12th July when Frank Meaden came and photographed them they were
well feathered; and T. Sharland, who helped me by letting me have his
mealworm culture saw them on 14th. On 17th July all three left the
nest, and although I had been worried about possible deformities all were
perfect.

The young tended to keep to the cover of the reed-bed and remained
close together. Within three or four days of leaving the nest they were
already beginning to take greenflies.
In describing this breeding I should like to acknowledge the help and
advice of my good friend Frank Meaden, which made it possible. I have
gained a lot of useful information from him on keeping softbills and he is
the first person I have met who is willing to pass on to others his knowledge
and experiences in this field of aviculture.

of this interesting little species of the genus Poicephalus.
I acquired a pair from a Harrow dealer in July 1970. I considered
them to be a true pair mainly because the cock has a larger beak and more
yellow on the crown; and is also a much bolder bird, if bold is the right
word, as both birds were, and are, very nervous. I decided to winter
them out in a flight 4m.Xim.X2m. with a small shelter shed attached--
which incidentally they never use except for feeding in.
They were fed the usual diet of sunflower seed, etc., supplemented
with apple and carrot of which they seem very fond. To this was added
a sprinkling of a multi-vitamin additive. They came through the winter
very well and did not seem to bother much about the cold.
On 3rd April I hung a small log--a section of a natural hollow of an ash
tree with a woodpecker's hole just the right size. They showed no interest
in mating except that on a few occasions the cock was seen to feed the
hen on regurgitated food. Briefly that was all that happened in 1971.
They were wintered out again--a fairly reasonable winter anyway, the
main problem, of course, being the possibility of frost-bitten feet as they
would insist on roosting out all the time. So I fixed a sheet of glass over
the top of their favourite perch. Glass may be rather cold but it does
help to keep off the worst of the snow and rain.
At the beginning of January 1972 they seemed to become rather more
voluble than usual so I took the old log down and part filled it with peat.
This was a bit early in the year and I hoped (?) that they would not go to
nest in the worst part of the winter even though some parrots do,
particularly Ringnecks (Psittacula krameri). The hen promptly threw

the peat out after a few days. The weather was wet for most of the month
with snow showers on the 30th. I left the log up and put more peat in a
few weeks later, around the beginning of March. This was thrown out
again. On the 25th March I filled the log with rotten wood. They also
objected to that! (I was beginning to think they might like some hay and
feathers instead!) On the 1st April I put another larger natural log hung
up at an angle as this has been known to have the desired effect. This was
also not appreciated so I removed it on the 20th April. On the 25th
April the cock was seen popping in and out of the original log which had
been refilled with rotten wood. The week ending 14th May had been
very wet and cold so I decided to have a look to see if anything was
happening and on the 16th May I was surprised to see one egg so, as the
birds are very nervous, I kept away.
On the 16th June, as the weather was warming up, I took another look
in the log and saw two babies possibly about a week old. There was
just a bit of down on them then. All this time the hen seemed to do all
the sitting, while the cock agitatedly hopped about by the pop hole.
On the 30th July one young was seen to peep out of the log. This must
have gone on for a long time as he did not come out until the 10th August.
It was a very fine bird, nearly as big as the adult cock bird, but having a
shorter tail and no yellow on the crown. It was not quite as nervous as
the parents. I was pleasantly surprised to see two more come out of the
log on the 13th August and still one more on the 15th! Presumably
these eggs were laid over a period of a few days.
From the 15th to 20th August all four babies went back into the log.
I would have thought this behaviour was a bit strange but presumably
mother knows best! Now I have four fine young, rather nervous, but I
hope that they will tame down, although the parents have never really
become tame in the two years I have had them.

[Eos reticulata )
By R. W. Phipps (Maidenhead, Berkshire, England)
I have for some years now found lories and lorikeets to be among the
most engaging of birds, and was glad to have a chance of obtaining a pair
of Blue-streaked Lories from some imported by Mr. Jim Hayward of
Carterton Breeding Aviaries in 1971. He had six or so of these birds,
all in excellent condition and by then acclimatised; and although they
all looked very similar Mr. Hayward selected two which he believed to be
a true pair, the black belly markings of the supposed female being rather
larger and rounder than those of the male.
These lories, from the Tenimber Islands between Australia and New
Guinea, are a bright if rather deep crimson colour, freely marked with
black on wings and tail and with dark red and black mottling on the breast
and underparts. The bill is orange and narrow light blue feathers
extend in a broad streak from behind each eye down the sides of the
neck, with similar colour on the mantle. Knowing which is which of my
pair I can see a slight difference in head-shape between them, that of the
male being somewhat larger and with a rather more prominent forehead.
Apart from the belly markings mentioned, which are possibly diagnostic
as to sex, any other differences in markings appear to be so slight as to be
individual rather than sexual characteristics.
The season being summer (1971) the birds were put into an outdoor
aviary of about 4 ft. x 8 ft. x 6 ft. high, including an open-fronted shelter--
modest enough proportions by any standards, but I have found that lories
do not require large spaces, being rather heavy fliers and spending much
time climbing, posturing with much exaggeration and performing
numerous acrobatics. The perches provided were of natural fruit tree
branches complete with their various off-shoots.
The main food provided then, and through the winter, was a mixture of
a complete human food such as Complan or Gevral and honey in equal
proportions, stirred into a paste with a little water and then diluted to a
milk-like consistency with more cold water. A little fresh milk was
added sometimes, and eventually a mixture of sugar and honey was used
in place of honey only, with the object of more nearly matching flower
nectar which almost always contains more sucrose (sugar) than it does
glucose and fructose, which are the principal ingredients of honey after
the bees have completed their inversion process. I am not among those
who believe that honey must be better than sugar for nectar feeders
because it is a " natural " food, but the general question of feeding such
birds is an interesting subject in itself and beyond the scope of these notes.
Maggots, mealworms, various fruits, berries and seeds were provided
through the Autumn and Winter, but little enthusiasm was shown for

any of these with the exception of some dates of the type one buys in
boxes around Christmas time. The birds were transferred to unheated
indoor accommodation from December to February, mainly for reasons
of convenience, but I believe they could as well have stayed outside with a
nest-box for roosting in the shelter part of the aviary. Lories are what one
might call sensible birds, quite without the distressing suicidal tendency
of most parakeets I have kept to select the most exposed place on the
aviary wire for roosting, particularly during the long winter nights.
The birds were returned to the aviary already described early in March
1972 and, against all the rules, a nest-box was provided in the partly
enclosed section. The box was made from f in. wood, about 8 in. square
internally and 20 in. high with a 3 in. entry hole near the top, with a wire
ladder inside. The upper two-thirds of the front was hinged for con-
venient inspection of the interior, and about 5 in. of mixed peat and wood-
shavings was placed inside. This box was fixed in a back corner, the
top being 6 in. from the translucent plastic roof. Although mating was
observed during that month little interest was shown in the box, except as
something to climb around and for roosting on, until quite late in May
when it came into considerable daytime use.
As well as the usual nectar, maggots and hempseed were provided, both
of which proved more popular than when offered previously, but during
the first half of June both birds seemed to be out in the aviary too much
for incubation to be in progress.
On 23 rd June I took the chance when both birds were in the flight to
see if there was a cold egg or two in the box, and was a good deal more than
surprised to see the twin grey shapes of head and body of a chick which
must have hatched a few days earlier. From about that time both parents
spent much more of the daytime, as well as the night of course, in the
nest-box together, and much as I would have liked to follow the chick's
progress more closely they generally rushed back home whenever I
approached too closely or to replenish food and water.
By this time larger quantities of more solid food such as maggots and
hempseed were being taken and rather less of the liquid food. Fresh
fruit, greenstuff and dates were all consumed to a greater extent, and so
were maggot pupae which had previously been ignored. Fruit tree twigs
were stripped of bark, which appeared mostly to be eaten. Wholemeal
bread crumbs and baby food were added to some of the regular
nectar, and this was now accepted, having earlier been left. The birds
did not, however, welcome the addition of soya flour. Fresh corn cob
was appreciated when hung from the aviary roof, but was only partly
stripped when placed in a dish. The area round the nest-box was
sprayed with water during hot, dry weather.
From mid-July young feeding noises were heard, mostly during the
evenings and on 3rd August the chick was covered with grey down and
some quills showed, mainly on the wings. On 14th August some red

feathers were visible on the head and a few days later red was also seen on
the back; by this time the bird was about two months old. Early in
September, in addition to a general increase in red and black feathers,
some light blue ones had appeared on the crown and back of the head, a
colouring which is not present in the adults; and a fair growth of tail was
observed.
The parents made a lot of noise and took up quite aggressive attitudes
when the nest was approached, and the young bird responded by trying to
make itself as small as possible in a corner of the box, but the parents did
not rush back to the nest as they had done earlier.
By mid-September the young bird appeared quite fully feathered and
fully grown, differing from the parents only in the blue head markings
and dark grey instead of orange bill; but although by then three months
old showed no signs of leaving the nest. It did in fact leave early in the
morning of 25th September, just about 14 weeks from the probable date
of hatching, and apart from its rather poorly co-ordinated flying and
landing techniques it moved about the aviary as freely as did the parents.
The first night was spent on a branch in the shelter, head turned back in
typical fashion, the parents retiring to the top of the nest-box as was their
habit before nesting started. The overall red colouring can by this time
be seen to be duller than the adults and the dark markings on the under-
side are similar to those of the cock, but a less intense black.
After the young bird had left, the nest-box was examined. Although
the litter was damp and compacted it was not sticky, and the bottom of
the box was quite dry and clean; surprisingly so in fact as no escape holes
or wire tray were provided in the base. Little if any of the wood-shavings
had been chewed up; and although the litter was replaced it could just as
well have been left for another brood as far as could be judged from its
appearance, texture and complete lack of odour. There was no sign of
egg shell or any indication that more than one egg had been laid.
During the next two weeks the parents were observed feeding the young
one, and they all appeared to get on well enough for me to conclude that
they could possibly spend the winter together. However, on 9th October
the parents were twice seen to make what can best be described as a sort
of mock attack on the young one; more, it was judged in an attempt to drive
it away than to inflict injury. These " attacks " were accompanied by a
good deal of noise and although quickly abandoned on my approach, it
was thought best to transfer the young bird to another aviary, since it
had been seen to feed itself, especially on more solid items like apple and
corncob. On its own now, it appears especially fond of apple and one
wonders if the parents provide a fairly solid food with consequent search
for something of similar texture by the young during the early days of
independence.
On 12th October the parents were spending some time in the nest again,
and renewing their interest in the cuttlefish which is always available.

I do not want them to start this long operation again before next spring,

(Semnornis ramphastinus)
By Bryan S. Ward (Heysham, Lancashire, England)
The eight-inch long Toucan Barbet is found in South America, in the
somewhat confined range of Western Ecuador and Columbia.
It has a black face, crown and nape with elongated feathers from the
hindcrown, and white stripes from above each eye down to the back of the
head. The sides of the head, neck, throat and upper breast are blue-grey,
with a broad red band across the lower breast, the abdomen and sides of
the body are dull yellow. The mantle being olive brown and the rump
golden yellow. It has grey-black wings and tail. The eyes are red and
the feet grey.
We purchased our pair of barbets towards the end of 1970. During
the following year they attempted to nest, by chipping away at a rotten
log in various places, and ultimately succeeded in making a suitable
nesting hole about 18 in. from the floor. This attempt was thwarted
when one morning we found the female with a damaged wing, hopping
around on the floor and unable to fly. She has never fully recovered, and
can fly only very short distances, but gets around very well by jumping
from perch to perch.
After a long period of convalescence, we reintroduced her to the male
and within a couple of days she had started to use the hole that they had
both hollowed out previously, even though since her accident, both the
male and the log had been removed to another compartment.
As with most barbets, they spent quite some time in the hole, so I am
unaware of when she first started laying her eggs, and consequently of the
actual incubation time. We heard sounds from the youngsters on 16th
August, 1972 and as they grew older they also grew considerably more
noisy, in fact they were the most noisy of any young I have ever heard.
The three youngsters remained in the nest, for what seemed to be a

very long time, the first of them leaving 43 days from the initial time of
hearing them. The other two left at further intervals of two days.
For the first half of the nestling period they were, as far as I know, fed
mainly on mealworms, plus a small amount of our soft food mixture.
Latterly, the parents were observed taking fruit, chiefly grapes, into the
nesting hole, and for the last couple of weeks, mice two or three days old
were given and quickly taken into the nest for the young birds.
The young are exactly the same as their parents except that they are
approximately 1 in. smaller and their colouring slightly paler. Their
eyes, unlike the adults are black.
As described above, the Toucan Barbet, Semnornis ramphastinus , has
been bred at the Winged World. It is believed that this may be a first

THE BREEDING OF PYRRHURA CONURE
HYBRIDS

My aim is to keep true pairs of parrots, but a few single birds in any
collection are almost inevitable. My single birds are all housed in the
same aviary, one of a range of four, three of which measure 14 ft. long,
3 ft. wide and 6 ft. high. In June of this year the aviary contained a
female White-crowned Pionus, an aged male Ringneck, a female Pacific
Black-tailed Conure (see Avicultural Magazine, vol. 75, 128 for a full
description of this bird) and a male Red-bellied Conure of the sub-species
chiripepe. Earlier in the year and for the two previous years the latter had
paired with a Pearly Conure (P. perlata) but the result was always eggs
which contained chicks dead in the shell. A few weeks previously the
hen Pearly had been removed from the aviary and provided with a mate
of her own species.
The male Red-bellied then turned its attention to the Black-tailed
Conure, whose mate died in January 1971. The two birds took over a
nest-box which stands on the aviary floor and measures 20 in. high and
9J in. square. I believe that the first egg was laid on 13th June but I
did not inspect the nest before going away for a week a few days later.
On my return there were five eggs.
The first of these probably hatched on 8th July, the incubation period
of Pyrrhuras being 26 days. On that day, the Ringneck, the father of
many chicks in his younger days, was seen sitting on the nest-box perch

and looking into the nest, no doubt hearing a squeaking chick. Also on
that day, I had no choice but to introduce my male Purple-bellied Parrot
(Triclaria malachitacea) into the aviary. It had previously shared the
next enclosure with a male Roseate Cockatoo but on obtaining a mate for
the Roseate, the Purple-bellied had to be removed. It was with some
misgivings that I introduced the Purple-bellied into the aviary but no
other accommodation was available. However, his presence did nothing
to disrupt the harmony of the aviary.
The next day I inspected the box to find one chick covered with long
white down. The nest was then inspected daily and the chicks were
handled daily from an early age. On ioth July there were two chicks,
a third hatched on the 12th and on the 15th there were four chicks. The
remaining egg probably contained a chick dead in the shell.
The growth rate of the fourth chick was very much slower than that
of the other three and I was not surprised to find it dead when it was about
two weeks old. At that age the other chicks were covered with dark grey
down but this one was almost naked. The eyes of the chicks opened
when they were about 11 days old and the hen ceased to brood them during
the day when they were about two weeks old. At four weeks they were
seen to preen themselves. Two showed no distress at being handled
while the third (a hen?) always struggled and even attempted to bite on
some occasions.
Not an advocate of hybrid breeding, I was, nevertheless, interested
to see whether the young hybrids would take after one parent or whether
they would show features of both. One of the first areas to show colour
was the bend of the wing which was mainly orange in the eldest and red
with a few flecks of yellow in the youngest two. As they feathered,
however, it became apparent that in every other aspect they resembled the
male parent, the Red-bellied Conure. The bend of the wing and the
under wing-coverts are scarlet in the hen and green in the cock.
As the young hybrids grew the area of colour on the bend of the wing
seemed to decrease in prominence until at the time of writing (3rd Septem-
ber) the colour is barely perceptible in two, which have part of the small
feathers at the bend of the wing orange. In the third youngster, this area
is scarlet and slightly more extensive but not very prominent. In other
respects they resemble the male parent except that the barring on the
upper breast is less prominent and less colourful, as in young Red-bellied
Conures; also, the ear-coverts are greenish rather than buff and there is
only a suggestion of maroon on the abdomen. In size they are slightly
larger than the hen but a little smaller than their male parent.
Young Pyrrhura conures often leave the nest for short periods only at
first, returning immediately imagined danger threatens. The first of the
hybrids probably fledged on 28th August but it was not seen to leave the
nest until 31st August when it returned after a short period in the aviary.
On 2nd September I removed all three young from the nest-box but two

soon returned, although they were fully developed and perfectly able to
fly.
Pyrrhura Conure chicks are very easy to rear. Soaked millet sprays,
one each morning and evening, and extra apple and carrot were provided
during the rearing period, also sponge cake soaked in nectar to which was
added a multivitamin preparation. The usual dry seeds, sunflower,
canary, white millet and niger were available but were hardly touched
during the rearing period. This coincided with several weeks of almost
no rainfall so no wild greenfoods could be supplied.
I have a large number of references to hybrid parrot breedings but
regrettably few give details of the appearance of the resulting hybrids.
In Lovebirds and Australian Parrakeets the result is often an unattractive
plumage pattern which shows features of both parents. I was therefore
pleased to find that the Pyrrhuras resembled one parent. The hybrid
breedings in which this has been the case include a male Festive Amazon
Parrot (Amazona festiva) paired to a Yellow-billed Amazon [A. collaria ),
whose three young all resembled the cock and the breeding of a hen
Vernal Hanging Parrot ( Loriculus vernalis) with a Blue-crowned Hanging
Parrot ( L . galgulus) where the young took after the hen in appearance.
While visiting Clifford Smith of Denholme earlier this year he pointed to
what appeared to be a Yellow-fronted Amazon ( Amazona ochrocephala
ochrocephala) and, to my surprise, asked me what it was. It transpired
that its parents were a Blue-fronted Amazon (A. aestiva) and a Yellow-
front.

(Deroptyus accipitrinus)
By Mrs. N. Howard (Codsall Wood, Wolverhampton, England)
My hen Hawk-headed Parrot is eight years old. She was one of my
tame pets for several years, at a time when very few came into this country.
I had almost given up hope of obtaining a cock bird. I had two more
but these were also hens. Then I managed to get a young cock which
is now six years old.
This year (1972) is the first in which there has been any sign of nesting.
Three different types of nest-boxes, including a four-foot Grandfather
type, were put into the flight. She rejected all and finally settled in an
old box that they had played about with earlier. This box is 36 in. X 12 in.
square. It was put in two years ago, close under the roof of the flight,
placed sideways.
On 30th April two eggs were found in the nest. The cock bird was
very noisy and upset, so it was decided to close this range of aviaries to
anyone, except at feeding times, since the hen left the nest every time she
heard the male distressed. Had we not closed this range of aviaries to
visitors I feel sure she would have left the eggs.
She hatched one chick 28 days later. This left the nest at nine weeks.
It was then fully feathered and almost as large as the parents. The beak
of the young bird has a light grey streak down the centre, and the eyes
lack the golden ring and appear to be large and dark.
While the birds were sitting and while feeding the young they were
given the same food. This was a mixture of white sunflower, hemp,
plain canary and a large amount of peanuts, in shell and also shelled.
Millet spray, not soaked, was also given and large amounts of fruit such
as pears, bananas, grapes and oranges. Rose-hip syrup, and baked
bread-and-butter pudding made with eggs and milk, sugar and raisins
were also given.
The young bird is now four months old and appears to be a cock bird.
I believe this is a first breeding, apart from that at the Chicago Zoo in
1954 - 55 *
As described above, Mrs. N. Howard has bred the Hawk-headed
Parrot, Deroptyus accipitrinus. It is believed this may be a first success.

I have hand-raised several North American hummingbird chicks and
maintained them through the first year; some to the threshold of adult
plumage, others through the molt into the fully adult condition. There is
much of interest to relate in both situations.
The " hero " of my story is a male Black-chinned hummingbird
Archilochus alexandri\ a species native to western United States. This
particular bird hatched in a garden at Bakersfield, Ca. Other immatures
have been maintained simultaneously--also native Californians; Selasphorus
sasin the Allen's hummingbird, and Calypte anna.
The A. alexandri eggs were first sighted by the resident homeowner
on 25th April 1971; one hatched on 30th April 1971, the other on 2nd
May 1971. Bakersfield had heavy rainstorms on the 4th, 6th and 10th
of May; and the mother bird disappeared as of 14th May. The resident
then began to feed, using a commercial product with 27% protein and
some vitamins and minerals, which is designed as an outdoor supplement
for wild birds, not as a maintenance diet. The homeowner did not
contact San Francisco Zoo at this time and was unaware of more complete
formulas. She did not bring the nestlings indoors, but spoonfed them
in their nest in the garden from 15th through to 29th May. She believes
she fed about once per hour, sometimes oftener. The elder chick began
to flutter and exercise its wings on the 29th and at that point the nest was
brought indoors. By 3rd June, this chick was self-feeding and flying, but
the younger gaped for food for an additional 12 days and did not leave the
nest for three days more thereafter. In observations on North American
hummingbirds, the normal nestling stage appears to be 3-4 weeks; this
male chick spent nearly six weeks in his nest. Greenwalt believes nestling
stage varies with adequacy of nutrition, and this observation tends to
support that view.
Five days after " Alex " had abandoned his nest, the resident brought
both fledglings to the San Francisco Zoo; she feared they could not " make
it " in the wild, and I'm certain she was right. Alex had, during his
extended spoonfeeding days, become encrusted with syrupy slop. Once
flying and perching, he had diligently preened all offending feathers
completely out; thus was bare-breasted as a go-go dancer from chin to
"navel" (had he one!!). Bright pink tender, irritated flesh could also
be seen across his upper shoulders and on the back of his skull. Our
veterinarian thought perhaps the base skin had been damaged and ques-
tioned whether feathers would ever regrow. I proceeded to feed the two

on a formula with higher protein percentage, and took them home to
my already thriving colony of S. sasin homeless chicks. Fruit flies
were there available as a dietary supplement.
On 16th July (3J weeks later) Alex's pink flesh began to look dotted
and grainy; only a few short days later, new feathers were in place and
unfurled. These were iridescent violet in colour across the neck area;
the adult gorget feathers of the Black-chinned hummingbird male.
Within a week, he was engaged in aerial displays typical of his species.
If caged, he would demonstrate in front of the adjacent bird; a short,
shallow, shuttling arc, with a loud wingsnap at each direction change.
When free flying in the room, he executed the same manoeuvres, increasing
or decreasing the arc length at his own whim. Simultaneously, he
began to use territorial vocalizations. He was extremely aggressive for
many weeks, demonstrating in front of all other birds, three poodles, and
one human observer! He monopolized the air space and dominated three
immature sasin males, except during periods of time when they were
sprouting an iridescent gorget feather. (I saw much evidence of hormonal
linkage which must exist between iridescent feather growth, vocalization,
and aerial display. Dominance patterns shifted throughout the fall
months as one bird, then another, grew a feather.) The Allen boys did
not complete their gorget feathers then; that was to occur during April-May,
and took a full two months. Alex completed his first year moult ahead of
the Allen chicks--during the first two weeks of March. Transformation
was rapid; within the 14 day period, his pearly grey immature head feathers
were replaced by the adult male black ones. His iridescent necklace
did not appear to moult--having grown in out-of-phase due to the early
feather loss.
Territorial vocalizations and aerial displays diminished greatly in the
period December-February, although these did not disappear entirely.
I believe the intense activity of September-October relates to hormonal
activity in the first year male, which has been documented in other
species, as for example in Rufous-sided Towhees, where the number of
Leydig cells in the testes corresponds to singing behaviour and an increaso
in number of cells and in fall singing has been found in immature males
(Davis 1958). A further interesting observation is that during the
winter (and at present) the most dominant, aggressive bird has been the
alexandri female.
Turning to the problem of distinguishing between females and immature
males; in all the three species under my observation, behaviour and vocal-
ization can be valuable clues. The alexandri nestmates proved to be
male-female, though I had no absolute proof until after the Spring
72 moult. Although Alex was identified as male during July 71, normally
his violet necklace would not have been completed until spring. However,
his nestmate was never observed performing a " shuttle-arc ", although
she does give an identical territorial call. After completing her moult,

she looks just as she did during the first year, substantiating my belief of
her femininity based on behavioral observation. With S. sasin (four chicks
from three nests raised to free flying stage); three were male as evidenced
by (a) occasional sprouting of an iridescent gorget feather (orange in this
species) during their first summer-fall, and (b) territorial acrobatics and
vocalizations. The one S. sasin chick believed to be female did not
display, and unlike the female alexandri , she did not utilize a territorial
" song ", only a " chip-chip-chip " warning sound. Another indicator
of sex may have been the aggressive Alex's persistent attempts to court
her, which unsought attentions may have hastened her death from
exhaustion at six months of age.
How does one distinguish between female or immature A. alexandri
and Calypte anna individuals? Both are pearly-grey with slightly
iridescent backs and shoulders (green). If size is not a sufficient clue
(C. anna tends to be larger and stockier) voice is. Tonal quality and
rhythm of both territorial calls and in-flight chipperings are easily
distinguishable to those attuned to hummingbird voice. Similarity of
territorial vocalizations point to common background and close recent
relationships between these genera, while distinguishable differences in
rhythm and tone are suggestive of species recognition releasers in sympatric
species. C. anna has a sweeter, more bell like tone in its " chip-chip-chip ";
and the territorial challenge has a ringing, chortling quality.
Tail wagging in flight is equally pronounced in alexandri and anna\
less noticeable in sasin which appears to have a faster wing beat and less
fluttery flight style. Tail action varies with speed, however.
The " whine " when disturbed at night is common to all three species;
it can be a most piteous, alarming sound--when first I picked up a bird
from its perch in the dark I nearly dropped it at the sudden and un-
expected heart-stopping wail. But the chick clung to my hand (no
attempt to fly in the dark) and allowed itself to be placed in a cage for
safe keeping. Within a short time, each Blackchin had learned to expect
my finger lightly touching its chest in the dark, and would dutifully
climb aboard to be carried away to a cage perch--locked in for the hours
I was at work; thus assured an ample and unchallenged food supply
each day. The Allen chicks never became that tame. All my chicks
when in good health would be instantly alert whenever a light was turned
on. Exceptions to this were rare and explainable. One, a flightless
invalid, as he began to fail, spent longer and longer periods in torpor;
once a healthy chick, found in torpor when I came home at night, was
found to have somehow been shorted in food supply that day--with
insufficient fuel, he was conserving his energy.
At this date, I no longer cage the two remaining in my care (male and
female alexandri )--their "aviary" consists of my bedroom-bath, with
perching branches supplied in vases; sometimes fuchsias from the garden;
always open-doored cages with several containers of food; fruit flies.

Bathing varies on an individual basis. The female alexandri bathes at
least once daily; the male rarely. First bathtub; my cupped hands in
the sink. Later they took to using the dogs' water bowl--I hastily
bought them a parrakeet bathtub, which seems to suit them admirably.
I have raised only one C. anna chick, and it did not bathe during the few
weeks I kept it. Had I retained the bird longer, perhaps it would have
developed the habit. The Allen's chicks varied in their use of water.
One would wash continually in a tiny food cup filled with water, others
used my hands and/or the bathtub mentioned.
At present, I am wondering if the male-female alexandri will breed in
my bedroom, or if space is sufficiently cramped that his modified aerial
displays will fail to trigger her recognition and acceptance. It seems as
if I shall have to wait another year, however, since these birds were
separated during the crucial spring breeding months and currently
appear to be disinterested in mating. Both are adamantly territorial
regarding food supplies.

The first part of this list was published in vol. 78 (1972), Sept.-Oct.
number, pp. 169-172. The abbreviations are given in the introduction
to part 1. As previously requested I hope that readers will bring to my
attention any errors or omission.
Since our many overseas members may feel the scope of the list to be a
little limited, I would explain that with the proliferation of zoos and
collections, and with the increase in the variety of publications where
breeding results are likely to be mentioned it is no longer possible for any
one person with other commitments and a limited amount of time to
keep track of breedings on a world scale. I would suggest that members
in other countries and continents might compile and maintain the breeding
records for their own regions as a permanent source of reference.
I have omitted the word " first " from the title of this second part, since
I am concerned only with establishing as far as possible what has or has

NEWS FROM THE BERLIN ZOO

European Flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) and four Chilean
Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus chilensis ) were hatched.

Interesting newcomers are three Crested Screamers ( Chauna chavaria).
Even zoologists took several decades to recognize these long-legged birds
as relatives to ducks and geese. The native land of the Crested Screamers
is South America (Colombia and Venezuela) where they live in forests
rich in water. They are armed with sharp spurs at the wings (meta-
carpalia). During mating time they fight fiercely with these arms and by
aimed wing-strokes they may even put lesser carnivora to flight. Hand-
reared young quickly become tame. Since they utter loud warning calls
as soon as they see an enemy (hence their English name: Screamers) they
are often kept as " watch dogs " in chicken yards.
Owing to the successes in breeding and raising birds, the Berlin Zoo got
on loan two White-Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon crossoptilon ) hatched in
the Jersey Zoo (Channel Islands) which is famous for its fine breeding
successes of these valuable birds. Since it seemed dangerous, in view
of disease, to concentrate such a rare bird species in only one place, the
owners decided to send a pair to Berlin. The Pheasants meanwhile seem
to have got accustomed quite well to their spacious aviary.
In addition to the above-mentioned hatchings and new arrivals there
were hatched: three Southern Red-billed Whistling Ducks ( Dendrocygna
autumnalis discolor ), five Black Swans ( Cygnus atratus), two Black-backed
Radjah Shelducks ( Tadorna r. radjah ), three Andean Crested Ducks
(Lophonetta specularoides alticola), six Tufted Ducks (Ay thy a fuligula ),
two Nepal Kalijs ( Gennaeus L leucomelanus ), two Blue Crowned Pigeons
(Goura cristata).

Goldeneyes (Bucephala c. clangula ), 3 Andean Flamingos (Phoenicoparrus

The main breeding season of 1972 has now drawn to a close and despite
the efforts of vandals and egg-stealers to thwart our aims there have been
a number of notable successes. Owls, as is now usual, have been one
of the most successful groups and seven species or sub-species have
reared young. These include Savigny's and Kenya Eagle Owls,
Abyssinian and African Spotted Eagle Owls, Snowy Owls, a West African
Wood Owl and a Barn Owl. It was particularly pleasing to rear four
Savigny's Eagle Owls as the parents had only been introduced to each
other a few months previously. It was however saddening to have one of
the almost fledged youngsters stolen when their aviary was broken into
during the night.
The most exciting event was the rearing of a Blue-backed Manakin
from a pair in the Tropical House. This is thought to be the first breeding
in captivity in the world and a more detailed account will be published
later in the Avicultural Magazine. It was an event not without
problems for the young bird left the nest before it could properly fly and
there was considerable danger of it either drowning in the moat, being
trodden on or being snatched up by our ever-pressing public. Mother
and child were removed to the safety of a Bird House cage and the rest of
its adolescence has passed without incidence.
Other successful rearings have included Jerdon's Imperial Pigeons,
White-cheeked Turaco, Bristle-crowned, Malayan Glossy and Superb
Starlings, Sacred Ibis and Hawaiian Geese. The tree in which the
White-cheeked Turacos of the Snowdon Aviary had previously bred in
collapsed during a storm, and a wooden scaffolding was erected over which
the still flourishing creeper was persuaded to grow. Fortunately the
Turacos accepted this man-made edifice and nested again in amongst the
creeper.
Species new to the Collection have included Red-throated Bee-eaters
and James's Flamingoes. This means the Collection now has all known
species of flamingo on view.
Species of especial interest which have been received into the Collection
since the beginning of the year include: two Short-eared Owls from Cal-
gary Zoo, White-fronted Bee-eaters, Red-headed Tits, a Laughing Falcon,
two captive-bred Desert Eagle Owls and an Avocet. This latter bird was
found injured in Cornwall in early February and it was quickly obvious
that it would never again be able to fend for itself in the wild. It had
sustained a compound fracture of the wing which necessitated amputation.
This was carried out in the Zoo Hospital, and the patient made a remarkably
quick recovery. It has now settled down well, has caused no problems
in feeding and has indeed stimulated some display behaviour from the

two much older Avocets which originally came from Copenhagen Zoo.
The aviaries near the Bird House, known as the Peafowl Aviaries, have
been completely renovated and replanted. They now house an interesting
and colourful collection including Scarlet Ibis, Roseate Spoonbills,
Ross's and Knysna Turacos, Great Indian Hornbills, Kookaburras and
Blue and Green Peafowl.
As management techniques improve and our knowledge of what
individual species require increases, so the symptoms of old age both
before and after death become more common. Often it has to be explained
to the public that apparent ill-health is in fact mainly the sluggishness of
senility. Though at times we feel we run a geriatric unit our general
policy on euthanasia is that it is only necessary when a bird shows obvious
signs of distress or pain. The following old birds have died since the last
Zoo Notes were written. The length of time the bird was in the Collec-
tion is given in brackets, though for many this will be less than their real
age. The last three species were hatched in the zoo and their true ages
are therefore known.

Two Casqued Hornbills have been reared successfully at " Birdworld ",
Farnham, Surrey. The female was sealed into her nest by the male in
May and emerged with her two youngsters exactly four months later.
A pair of another species, the Giant Indian Hornbill, were not so
successful at " Birdland ", Bourton-on-the-Water and L. W. Hill writes,
" The Giant Indian Hornbills went to nest in March again and we had
great hopes but the male was so impatient that he broke open the nesting
hole and entered the nesting box. He broke the egg and emerged with
the unborn chick which he dropped in front of us ".

Malcolm Ellis sends further news of the breeding of Ross's Turaco in a
Nairobi aviary. He writes, " The article from the East African Standard
concerning the breeding of Ross's Turaco which was quoted in the " News
and Views " section of the magazine was sent by me to Colin Harrison
so long ago that I cannot remember very much about it. I think, how-
ever, that I should set the record straight as to the likelihood of this
representing a first recorded successful breeding, for unfortunately, the
chick died before becoming independent. When I visited the aviary this
week (August 1972) the female was incubating once again. This time
the aviary has been divided into two with a wire partition, with the male
bird housed in one half and his sitting mate in the other. They have a
clear view of each other but the male is prevented from interfering in the
nesting activities. I believe he was responsible for the first attempt
failing." Malcolm Ellis promises to send further news of the latest attempt
which, if it proves successful, will not represent a first recorded breeding
of Ross's Turaco, after all, because it has been bred successfully in the
Cologne Zoo and the event was recorded in the Avicultural Magazine
about two years ago.

International Zoo Yearbook include a number of items on birds. The
current volume (1972) has accounts of the breeding of the Kiwi and the
Australian Owlet-Nightjar ( Aeogotheles cristatus) at Sydney Zoo. The
latter appears to represent the first breeding of a member of this family,
and with the breeding of the Tawny Frogmouth at Wassenaar some years
ago and Heinroth's famous success with the Common Nightjar breeding
on the dining room rug, this seems to be only the third success with species
of Caprimulgiformes. Other articles concern the hand-rearing of Ostriches
and Rheas, breeding the Golden Eagle in Topeka Zoo and Choughs at
Paignton Zoo, artificial insemination of the Copper Pheasant and notes
on the display and nest-building of the Sickle-billed Bird of Paradise at
Chester Zoo. The previous volume (1971) has a little more space
devoted to birds and includes a record of a second captive-bred generation
of White Pelicans in East Berlin Zoo, notes on hand-rearing a Stanley
Crane and a Macaw hybrid, the use of canthaxanthin to maintain red

the parents had been reared in a Tropical House they adapted well to and
reared their youngsters in an outdoor planted aviary, of ground area 200

The incubation period was 14-15 days and the chicks left the nest when

The Orange-bellied Grass Parrakeet is undoubtedly the rarest member
of the genus Neophema. In recent years it has been observed in the wild
in Tasmania and South Australia very occasionally and only a few speci-
mens have been kept in Australian aviaries. There have been rumours
from time to time of its successful breeding in captivity but none have
been authenticated. One or two pairs have somehow(!) recently reached
Europe and J. Postema of Gieterreen, Holland, acquired a pair. This year

they nested, hatched five chicks but were successful in rearing only one.
However, this very exciting event must surely represent the first authentic
record of the breeding of the Orange-bellied Parrakeet in captivity

G. A. Smith writes, " Such a drab, wet year may have affected my
parrot breeding results for the three pairs of Many-colours had only single
rounds and some chicks from each clutch died--previously I have accepted
that a chick hatched is a chick reared! Unfortunately I lost my male New
Zealand Parrakeets with ' an aberrant Eperythrozoon infection ' presumably
spread by biting insects. Mr. A. Marques kindly let me have on loan a
cock of the Yellow-fronted species and although the hen laid three fertile
clutches the eggs were addled each time. I feed milk sop and give
vitamins B 12 and B complex and find the cause of the ' addling ' most
perplexing. Still my single pair of Rock Peplars reared four fat offspring
and the Ringnecks did very well. I was unable to get a replacement cock
for my hen Malayan Longtailed Parrakeet and true to feminine whim
she laid a clutch, infertile of course, in May and not in late September as
she has done in the previous two years. Since then I have acquired a
small number of acclimatized young birds and one adult cock, and they
are to be put into a new, larger aviary in an attempt to colony breed in the
coming year. Celestial Parrotlets, in a small cage, laid eight eggs of
which four were fertile and hatched. I placed rings on the legs of two of
the youngsters and the parents literally tore the legs off to remove the
rings.

Unfortunately the hen stops brooding when the chicks are about ten
day old and the winter chicks die of exposure. In early Apiil I was certain
that they had laid again--which would have been their fourth successive
clutch. The hen stayed in the box and there had been much mating
and feeding. Nothing materialized, she stopped being broody and I had
to wait until 10th July before she laid the fourth clutch. The chicks are
now six weeks old. At three weeks the smallest chick showed no increase
in weight over a three day period and so I hand-fed it on Farex and milk
and it began to put on weight. After four days I discontinued and it
flourishes. The growth of this chick duplicates that of the single chick
raised last year but the other two older ones have progressed more
rapidly and look like leaving the nest a fortnight before the youngest.
I still have four Sun Conures. Two finger-tame youngsters are still
in ' baby plumage ' with many green feathers on the back and wings
and less orange on the chest and neck. The other ' pair ' have moulted
into two almost identical males! So it will be some time before I can hope
to breed them for it appears that Conures take two or three years to reach
maturity. As for my Hawk-headed Parrots, comparison of mine with
Mrs. Howard's breeding pair convinces me that they are a pair. The
male has a far more extensive patch of red in the tail and the iris is yellow
in contrast to the brown of the hen. Like Blue-rumped parrots they
prefer the * stone ' of Hawthorn berries to almost any other food."
Parrakeet breeders throughout Europe are familiar with the superb
collection owned by Lady Baillie and kept in a magnificent range of
aviaries at Leeds Castle in Kent. The fact that no description of the
collection or accounts of the events taking place in it have ever been
published in the Avicultural Magazine has always been to me a source
of regret. I am pleased, therefore, that this year J. D. Money, the Agent,
has given me permission to include a summary of their 1972 breeding
results in " News and Views ". It is as follows:

of Wales, Kings, Rock Peplars, Bauers, Barnards and Mealy Rosellas.

The genus Pionus is represented by five different species--Blue-headed,
Bronze-winged, White-capped, Maximilian's and Coral-billed. There
are also a pair of Hawk-headed Parrots, several species of Cockatoo
ranging in size from the Palm to the Roseate and including several magnifi-
cent pairs of Leadbeater's and some Amazon Parrots of which an exqui-
sitely beautiful pair of the Vinaceous species stands out in my memory.
What is particularly exciting and almost unique about the collection is
the fact that almost all the birds are in pairs in large outdoor aviaries.
The beneficial effects of such accommodation on their condition and
plumage is almost unbelievable. Similar species kept in the conditions
which exist in most British Zoos are dull, listless and drab by comparison.
Many successful breedings occurred in 1971 and 1972, including Umbrella,
Lesser Sulphur-crested, Citron-crested and Leadbeater's Cockatoos;
Yellow-fronted, Double Yellow-headed and Vinaceous Amazons and
African Grey Parrots. This year Blue-headed Parrots nested and pro-
duced fertile eggs which the hen incubated assiduously but the embryos
died on the point of hatching.
It is more than two years since an article by C. Smith on his success in
breeding the Double Yellow-headed Amazon appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine. The Council of the Society has still not decided whether its
medal should be awarded for a first breeding because it cannot decide
whether the Double Yellow-headed Amazon is a true species or a sub-
species. It certainly looks very different from any other Amazon species
and, in any case, the breeding is a particularly meritorious one. Perhaps
we members of the Council would be better employed and serve
aviculture better if we gave more time to considering how to improve
the magazine and make membership of the Society more attractive!

<bodyText confidence="0.997810545454545" page_id="56367447"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
Rutgers and K. A. Norris. London: Rlandford Press, 1972. #&amp;.
The first volume of the English edition of this encyclopaedia was
published two years ago, and covered a systematic series of bird families
from the ostriches to the pigeons. The second of the three volumes is
now published and continues the sequence; dealing with parrots, cuckoos,
touracos, owls, nightjars, swifts and hummingbirds.
In format and content this volume is very similar to the first. It has
one special feature in that, recognising the importance to many avicultur-
lists of the parrot family, the editors have devoted nearly three-quarters
of the volume to it, and have given an entry for every species. This
includes a brief description of the adult male and female; subspecies are
listed, and in many cases the distinctive differences are given, and in some
instances distinct subspecies frequently kept in aviaries are given separate
entries. In this extensive coverage of the family the volume is probably
at present unique.
There is an introductory section on the keeping and feeding of parrots,
and additional general summaries in the text for some of the major groups
such as the Amazons. The Budgerigar has a special section which includes
information on colour breeding and establishing liberty flocks, and on
the Fancy; and there are also several colour plates devoted to rather
improbable ideals in colour and patterns of the domestic bird.
All the species entries in the book give common names in English,
German, French and Dutch; a brief statement of distribution in the wild;
a description; and a general text, scanty in a few instances, which includes
notes on the birds' lives in the wild and information on keeping and
breeding in aviaries; the last sometimes including extensive quotation of
published accounts. My only reservation here is that some of the informa-
tion is quoted from rather early accounts, and might not be wholly applic-
able at the present time.
In general the text provides a useful source of general information on
these birds and the keeping of them, and it is the text that is the vital part
of the book. This does not excuse the fact that the illustrations are
consistently poor. The 32 black and white plates are a mixture of small
photographs and very reduced reproductions of Gould's plates, inconsis-
tently selected. The line drawings in the text often give a very poor idea
of a bird's appearance and appear to be copies of the 19th-century
illustrations. By cross-checking with the monochrome plates one finds
that a number are bad copies of Gould originals which were done from
skins with little knowledge of the live birds. Some of the 23 colour plates
are by Slijper, over-simplified but fairly accurate except for badly-
portrayed head shapes. Others, by van den Broecke, show shaggy-
plumaged and over-gaudy birds. Plates 6 and 7 with a Lear's Macaw
in one style facing a Hyacinthine Macaw in the other permit an assessment
of both artists. The Leadbeaters and Moluccan Cockatoos on the plate

also used as a cover illustration indicate the results of using old artists'
impressions as sources in preference to modern photographs of live birds.
The section on hummingbirds reflects the increasing avicultural interest
in this family. There is an introductory section on keeping and transport
by Jean Dealcour and others on torpidity, and breeding by K. A. Norris.
The family is a very large one, and the majority of genera are represented
in the text by only one or two species. The touracos have eight pages and
a fair amount of avicultural information for the space allowed. The owls
have only a dozen pages, although much of this is devoted to information
on keeping them. The text illustrations for the latter are lamentable.
The remaining families are considered of little importance to avicultur-
ists and have relatively brief treatment. The section on the owlet-
nightjars indicates the difficulty of dealing with rarer species in a work of
this kind. The comments appear to be based on the assumption that
owlet-nightjars feed mainly on the wing and would present considerable
problems. In fact they will readily take food from the ground and have
recently been bred in Sydney Zoo. Since Heinroth's breeding of the
nightjar is referred to, it is surprising that reference to the four volumes of
Die Vogel Mitteleuropas, with all their information on a great range of
species, has been omitted from the final bibliography.
In general this new volume of the encyclopaedia is likely to be a useful
and permanent source of reference, especially for the general aviculturist
who lacks access to a range of books on birds of various regions, or who is
likely to need urgent information on some group of birds with which he is
unfamiliar. It is likely to be of special value to the parrot specialist.
Apart from the parrots, one is left with the feeling that more could have
been done if effort had been directed towards a more general coverage
rather than an arbitrary selection of a limited number of species, and
illustrations concerned with points of identification rather than inaccurate
artistry.

# 1 &amp;apos; 30,
The growing interest in natural history has been accompanied by an
increasing variety of animals being kept as pets. Unfortunately some
of these are quite unsuitable to be kept in households because of their
special requirements, apart from the fact that some of them may be
potentially dangerous animals. The object of this book is to help people
to appreciate the time and effort, and in some cases the risk involved, in
looking after pet animals and to provide information which will contribute
towards lengthening their life span.

examples are considered with recommendations as to their housing and

Section II deals with birds in similar fashion and Section III with
mammals. Then follow four appendices dealing respectively with cages,
aviaries, nest-boxes, etc.; pet food components; live foods for animals;
and gestation periods, age at maturity and life spans of some animals kept
as pets.
The book is well illustrated and can be thoroughly recommended as a

HUMMINGBIRDS RESTING ON ONE FOOT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994820619047619" page_id="56367449"  page_num="220" year="" vol="">
In the July-August 1972 issue of the Avicultural Magazine, I read an interes-
ting article entitled " The Coronet Hummingbirds " that was written by Mr. A. J.
Mobbs. In this he noted that on several occasions he had observed species of
the Genus Boissonneaua resting on one foot and that he doubted that the Coronets
actually slept in this position since both feet would be required for stability. This
is probably the general rule for both wild and captive birds. However, it might
be interesting to note that the Philadelphia Zoological Garden received a Chestnut-
breasted Coronet, Boissonneaua matthewsii in August 1970. Upon its arrival,
it was found to be missing its left leg. The specimen was immediately placed on
exhibit in the Hummingbird House, a large walk-through flight area that contains
several specimens and species of humming and non-hummingbirds. Since the
bird is alive and healthy at the time of this writing, it is obvious that it has adapted
to its handicap.
Another example of a bird adapting to this type of situation is an Emerald
Starling, Coccycolius iris that was received in April, 1955. In March of the fol-
lowing year, its right leg was broken to the extent that amputation was required.
This specimen has since been living in a large flight area which exhibits various
medium to larger sized species.
The ability for some birds to adapt to this type of handicap in both the captive
and wild state has certainly been noted before. However, there seems to be a
note of interest with each example.
