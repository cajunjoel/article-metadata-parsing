1904-5.
It is once again with feelings of pleasure and relief that
we submit our annual report; a report which we are thankful
to say tells of 110 decrease either in finance, or in the quality
of the Magazine.
Starting the year with a balance of about #30, the receipts
of the year have been close on #300. The expenditure has been
kept well within this sum, and it is hoped that by the end of the
year there will be a substantial balance with which to start the
12th volume.
We have to thank the Rev. H. D. AstlEY for so generously
defraying the entire expense connected with the reproduction of
his charming drawing of Bourke's Parrakeet, which appeared in
the June number; Mr. T. H. Newman for the loan of the
drawing of the White-throated Ground-Dove, reproduced for
the January number; Mr. W. E. Renault for the blocks of
his admirable photographs of nests and eggs published in the
February number; and Sir William Ingram, Bart., and Mr.
Collingwood Ingram for the excellent illustrations from the
pen and brush of the latter gentleman, which appeared in the
October number. Finally we offer our grateful thanks to those
who have again this year kindly contributed to the Illustration
Fund, and by their generosity greatly relieved the financial
condition for the year.
We think that the Magazine has been found at least equal
in quality to any of its predecessors. Especially among the con-
tributors to its contents we welcome once more Mr. Phillipps'
articles, which are always so full of interest and instruction.
During the year eight coloured and numerous black and
white plates and figures have been given, principally the work
of Messrs. Gronvold and Goodchild, who have, we think, quite
maintained their usual excellence.
Mr. Gill has again most kindly given the post mortem
fees for the benefit of the Society.
This report would not be complete without mentioning the
part taken by our member, Mr. J. E. Bonhote, in the Inter-
</bodyText>

Report of the Council.
v.
national Ornithological Congress held in London during the
month of June. Mr. Bonhote then acted as one of the Secre-
taries for the Congress. It is universally admitted that much of
the success of this important event was due to the excellence of
the arrangements. The Congress was attended by many officers
and other members of this Society. Mr. Seth-Smith acted as
official delegate for the Society, and read a paper entitled "The
Importance of Aviculture as an aid to the study of Ornithology."
We would call attention to the work that has been accom-
plished by members in recording the breeding habits of species
which are not known to have bred in captivity in this country
before : the Rev. C. D. Farrar has successfully reared young of
the White-throated Finch ( Spermophila albigularis) ; Sir William
Ingram, Bart., the Bare-throated Francolin {Pternistes leiicoscepus),
and Mr. D. Seth-Smith the Varied Bustard Quail (Tumix varici)
and the Australian Swamp Quail ( Syncectis australis). Mention
may also be made of the breeding of some interesting hybrids ;
Dr. Buteer has reared a hybrid Ouzel between Merula boulboul
and M. merula; Mr. Fasey, hybrid Parrakeets between Platy-
cercus elegans and Barnardius semitorquatus ; and Mr. Seth-Smith
hybrid Song - Sparrows between Zonotrichia leucophrys and Z.
pileata ; while a Duck, bred this year by Mr. Bonhote contains
the blood of no less than five species, viz., Anas boseas, melleri ,
pcecilorhyncha, superciliosa, and Dafila acuta, an event hitherto
unknown in the annals of hybridism.
We would urge our members to do their best to persuade

all their friends who may be interested in birds to join the
Avicultural Society.
Finally our thanks are due to the members of the
Executive Committee, who have worked hard to promote the
welfare of the Society.

The latest achievement in Ornithology
Extracts from a letter from Mr. J. PARKINSON,
NATURALIST,
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October 30th, igoi.
" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot
Parrots which I have reared were brought up on your Aesthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE" of Dec. 4th
Says-- " Mr. Parkinson has apparently solved the problem of
Parrot-rearing, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

THE SOCIETY'S MEDAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.935444081081081" page_id="32656423"  page_num="19" year="" vol="">
The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine, within
about eight weeks from the date of the hatching of the young, and furnish
such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require.
The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be
old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their
parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full, so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young,
and he of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bonci fide property of the breeder.
Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the
breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will
seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently advance
for the breeding of the same or other species.
Iu every case, the decision of the Committee shall be filial.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze, and measures inches in diameter.
It bears 011 the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing
eggs, and the words " The Avicultural Society--Founded 1894." On the
reverse is the following inscription : " Awarded to {name of donee ) for
rearing young of {name of species) a species not previously bred in captivity
in the United Kingdom.

THE EUROPEAN GOLDFINCH.
Carduelis elegans.
By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
Of all our indigenous birds, there is not one such a
general favourite as the Goldfinch, although the Bullfinch and
Linnet run him very close. The former, however, although
bright in colour and tame and confiding by nature, has only a
soft and monotonous pipe for a song, much inferior to the
present species. Those Bullfinches specially trained to whistle
tunes, command so high a price in this country, that they may
be left out of consideration.
What the Linnet lacks in colour--for in captivity he is a
bird of sombre mien --is made up for by his song, and as he
may be bought very cheaply, and thrives in captivity, he has a
large following of admirers.
In spite, however, of these strong rivals for the position of
prime favourite, the Goldfinch will be acknowledged by most to
easily hold his own. His song, if not so full and varied as that
of the Linnet, is none the less very sweet and pleasing, whilst in
the brilliancy of his colour he easily takes first place. Brighter
and more variegated than the Bullfinch, a surprise is literally
' held up his sleeve,' for when flying the brilliant yellow of the
wing feathers, from which his name is derived, is displayed to
its full extent.
Owing to his being sought after on account of these many
attractions, it is not surprising that it is a much scarcer bird

Mr. J. Lewis Bonhote,
than it was some twenty or thirty years ago. On the bird-
catchers the sole blame for this scarceness has been laid, and
although, especially near large towns, they have undoubtedly
made a difference to the numbers of this charming bird, yet the
higher conditions of farming and the ever diminishing area of
waste land have probably had a far greater influence on this
scarcity.
Wherever suitable wild pasture laud, well overgrown with
thistles occurs there will be found the Goldfinch in very fair
numbers, darting from thistle-head to thistle-head with golden
gleam, a veritable jewel of nature. During the breeding season
it is generally to be found in small woods or copses and orchards,
returning regularly year after year to the same spot, and some-
times even repairing the old nest. Two broods are often reared
in a season, and as soon as the second brood has left the nest the
whole family takes flight to the open pastures.
Tame and confiding at all times, the young when they
first leave the nest fall an easy prey to the wiles of the bird-
catcher, who at such times is generally able to capture the whole
family ; but should the parents have their suspicions aroused in
any way, although both old and young may remain near the
nets for some considerable time, they will in all probability
never be caught, and will, into the bargain, warn off any other
families that may be passing.
Fabulous numbers of these birds used to be caught along
the South Coast about half a century ago and, according to
a correspondent in the Zoologist i860 p. 7,144, no less than
1,154 dozens were sent to London from the neighbourhood of
Worthing in the course of a single year. It must, however, be
borne in mind that over 1,000 of these dozens were caught on
migration in October and November, and consequently these
numbers, large as they are, could not have affected our home-
grown birds to any great extent. Last year, at Mr. Harvie
Brown's suggestion, many notes relating to the present status of
the Goldfinch in England were published in the Zoologist , and
afforded on the whole pleasant reading, for the majority of the
correspondents agreed that the protection laws had caused an

increase ill its numbers, and at the present time it is apparently
by no means uncommon in many parts of the country.
A description of so well known a bird would be super-
fluous. The sexes are alike in colour, but may be distinguished
by the shoulders of the males being a pure and intense black,
while those of the females are rusty. The young birds, known
as ' Grey Pates,' are similar to the adult but duller, and the head
is of a uniform greyish brown.
Varieties are not uncommon, and two of them are so well
known as to be universally recognised. The principal of these
is called the Cheverel: in this case the chin is white instead of
red, the white extending upwards on either side through the
black band and meeting on the occiput: although lam unable
to vouch for the statement, this variety is said to have a sweeter
and better song. Another well known variety is the Pea-throat,
in which the white on the chin, instead of entirely replacing
the red leaves a small patch the size of a pea in the centre.
Intermediate varieties exist, which are known to bird-catchers
as " Bastard Cheverels."
Albinism is not very uncommon, but I have just received
a curious melanistic variety in which the whole head is black,
the underparts very dark brown with the exception of a white
patch on the vent, back dark brown, wings normal.
The so-called foreign Goldfinches, in spite of what may
be said to the contrary, do not differ from our own ; but the
large Siberian birds, which are freely imported from Russia, are
undoubtedly a larger and brighter race, and it is this larger race
which meets and interbreeds with the Asiatic Goldfinch (C.
caniceps), on which species Mr. Finn is, I believe preparing an
article for our Magazine.

Carduelis ca?iiceps.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Just as the donkey suffers in general estimation from the
fact that he is not a horse, so is the present bird likely to be
looked down upon by comparison with the Common Goldfinch,
for wherever it differs from that species the difference is mostly
to its own disadvantage, the want of the distinct black-and-white
head marking being especially noticeable.
This particular difference is not seen in the " grey-pate "
stage of the two species, but such young birds are at once dis-
tinguishable by the very different proportions and arrangement of
the black-and-white on the quills, well shown in Mr. Goodchild's
beautiful drawing. Although this shows the Common Goldfinch
as a much browner bird than the very " mealy " caniceps, this is
not a constant distinction, as I have seen Persian skins of the
former which matched the latter in the light drab tone of their
colouring. The blaze is noticeably smaller in caniceps than
in the other, and the beak, also though as long as the
ordinary Goldfinch's or longer, inclines to the very acute and
thorn-like form of the Siskin's. But in most respects the two
birds are obviously cast in the same mould.
The Himalayan Goldfinch has a wide range, inhabiting
not only the Himalayas, but Siberia from Krasnoyarsk to Lake
Baikal, Transcaspia, Afghanistan, and Turkestan. In habits it
seems not to differ from the Common Goldfinch, but not very
much can be known about it, as its nesting is unrecorded. Here
then, is an opportunity for one of our members.
The most interesting point about the species is the inter-
breeding which goes on between it and its better-known ally
where they meet, in Siberia and Persia. As most of our
members probably know, fine specimens of these hybrid Gold-
finches with specimens of the pure birds, are on view in a case
in the Entrance Hall at the Natural History Museum, South
Kensington, these are Siberian specimens presented by the late
Mr. H. Seebohm.
This bird in the Himalayas keeps to rather high elevations,

ranging, according to season, from five to ten thousand feet. So,
as I was never there in the winter months, it is not astonishing
that I never saw it. Perhaps Mr. Harper, who was much on the
hills, may have done so.
I have, however, seen a good many of these birds in
Calcutta, whither they are brought from Cabul. During the
first few years of iny stay in Calcutta, I only saw a few isolated
specimens in Mr. Rutledge's possession, but in 1897 a fail-
number arrived, and I got six and sent them on to the London
Zoological Gardens, where three arrived safely. They were new
to the collection, and, I believe, to English aviculture, as I
never heard of the species in England before. Dr. Sclater, in
acknowledging their receipt, mentioned that he had reserved
one for a private experiment in pairing it with a Common Gold-
finch ; this should have been interesting, and perhaps he can
tell us how it turned out.
In 1900 a really large consignment was brought down by
an Afghan--I remember the man well, as he had blue eyes,
uncommon among natives--but these did not sell well, and
remained a long time on the market dealers' hands. They got
into a deplorable state, losing most of their feathers : this was, I
fancy, due to plucking by their companions in the store-cages,
for under proper treatment, in separate cages or in a large flight-
cage the birds did well, like the Common Goldfinch, which is
often brought to India and stands the heat perfectly, not gasping
as some even of the native birds do.
Not many of these Himalayan Goldfinches have been on
sale in England, but during the last year or two a few have been
obtainable, though they did not meet with much favour. As
they have been said to sing better than the European Goldfinch,
they might prove superior to that bird for breeding mules for
singing purposes; and for all we know they may be readier to
cross with the Canary--at any rate they would be worth trying.
I have never seen the " Cheverel " or white - chinned
variation among these birds, after examining many living
specimens and the good series of skins in the Indian Museum,
but it very likely may occur nevertheless, as allied species often
vary in the same way. Nor did I see any other variation.

Mrs. Johnstone,
In captivity this species becomes white-legged like the
common one--at least this was the case with some I saw in
Calcutta.
With regard to their treatment there, I may mention that
Mr. Rutledge used to give egg to his specimens of both species,
and I should recommend it to keepers of Goldfinches generally,
since they naturally feed partly on insects.

Turacus macrorhynchus.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
Judging by the rare reference to any species of Touracou
in the Avicultural Magazine, I should say they are somewhat
uncommon as aviary birds, but I think those who have kept
them will agree that they are some of the most delightful and
interesting birds imaginable.
My birds are singularly beautiful, being a soft grass-green ;
the wings and tail a glossy purple. The flight feathers are not
seen until the bird flies, when a broad band of brilliant crimson
is exposed and makes the bird a beautiful object when in flight.
The crest, which can be erected at pleasure, has a bar of white,
the tips being black. I purchased the cock three years ago,
from a dealer; he was quite healthy but almost featherless, quite
a baby, and had to be fed by hand, and the dealer informed me
he was a Senegal Touracou. Examining the Touracous of this
kind in the Zoological Gardens, I came to the conclusion that
whatever my bird was, he was not a Senegal. He soon grew out
of his baby plumage and throve immensely on a diet of soaked
biscuit and chopped banana and sweet-water grapes. His wife
came a year later, and here was a piece of good fortune not often
met with in the avicultural world--the only two Touracous ever
offered me--cock and hen, and the same species !
Last 3&apos;ear they were out all the summer in a large out-
door aviary, but the weather was too cold and wet and unpleasant,
and they never attempted to nest. The cock was, and is, very
fierce, and would attack me like a tiger if I presumed to offer

his wife any dainty ; with a dart he would alight on my head
and begin a vigorous onslaught. I caught him once as a punish-
ment, but found him very soft-feathered, the feathers coming
out in handfuls, so that this experiment was not repeated. This
summer they were both turned out into an aviary with a small
rhododendron bush in the centre and a little wooden hut for
them to shelter in. In the bush a basket lid was fixed, and in
the house a shallow cup-shaped basket, so that they might have
a choice of nesting accommodation, for I had always heard they
nested like pigeons, making a simple platform of sticks.
African birds appear to be very shy nesters, judging from
the Weavers and Glossy Starlings, so I had very small hopes of
any result. I was away from home all June, and one morning
received a letter to say the Touracous had laid an egg, but
some days after, a shock was sent in the intelligence that after
brooding most carefully for five days, the hen came off the nest
with the remains of the egg adhering to her feathers. This egg
was laid in the house, in the cup-shaped basket.
Egg number two was laid four days afterwards, outside,
on the hamper lid, and now I think my birds did a clever thing.
They carried the egg by some means from the hamper lid to
their old nest, the cup-shaped basket. Now the egg is about the
size of a pullet's egg, not an easy mouthful, and how they
carried it I do not know, but a Touracou has an enormous gape
and I can only conclude it was carried in the mouth.
However, in spite of every care on the part of the most
attentive parents imaginable, the second egg was broken in the
same way. Undoubtedly the eggs were soft-shelled. So a large
heap of lime was placed in the aviary, hoping that if another
attempt was made, the egg-shell would be harder. Egg number
three was laid on July 25th, and looked a much stronger egg.
It was very pink and laid in the hamper lid, in the rhododendron
bush. I took a peep at it in fear and trembling expecting every
moment to be attacked by the cock, for all this time his temper
had been very " short," and no interference was allowed for
a moment.
Another egg was added to the existing egg in three days'
time and then the hen commenced to sit. I was somewhat

Mrs. Johnstone,
surprised at the arrival of the second egg as I had made up my
mind one egg was the usual number laid, as the hen had only
laid one previously and commenced to sit at once.
Both birds brooded the eggs and never left them for a
moment, and almost exactly three weeks after, the hen com-
menced to sit, the first egg hatched. It was three days before I
obtained a look at the baby, when the mother had left it for a
moment to get some grapes just placed in the aviary. Imagine
a chicken of a day or so old, covered in darkest brown fluff,
bright black eyes, the skin round the eyes bare and grey, where
the white streak appears in the parents ; a yellow beak and
every appearance of health and strength. That the parents fed
it well I have no doubt, and at intervals I obtained a peep at it,

but it seemed to grow very little, and the feathers were a long
time appearing. But still I hoped all would be well. The old
birds were very attentive, never leaving the baby for longer than
was absolutely necessary, darting down to fetch banana and
grape and returning at once to look after their treasure. I never
could see them feed it; my time was very much occupied and I
had little time to sit and watch, but the man who looked after

them, told me he had seen the old bird squeezing a grape into
the little one's mouth..
Towards the end of September the nights turned very
cold, clear, and sharp, and I often thought of the featherless
condition of the baby, which at three weeks old was about the
size of a five days old chicken, but the flight feathers and tail
had grown well. When the bird was four weeks old the nights
seemed colder than ever, and after two nights of slight frost my
hopes of ever rearing the baby went down to zero. My fears
were not unfounded, for in the morning, after a night of three
or four degrees of frost, my man brought the poor little dead
body in. The parents had seemed distressed, or at any rate
excited, and followed him as he carried the body to the gate of
the aviary, calling loudly.
I cannot help thinking that if the first attempt had been
successful, and the bird hatched earlier , there would be no
difficulty in rearing the young ; but like a chicken, when cold
weather sets in, it did not grow, although fat and agile, as it
used to scramble about on its basket lid and put its head out
when under its mother's wing, to look about it. About a week
after, another egg was laid, but I have taken it away and brought
the old birds into an aviary where there is warmth at night, as
it would not be good for them to sit out at this time of year.
If they would nest indoors where warmth could be given on
cold nights, I have little doubt the young could be easily reared,
as the parents are indefatigable, and the food easy to obtain.
[Seeing that very little is known of the nesting habits of the
Touracous, Mrs. Johnstone's experience is extremely interesting. The
young bird above figured has been examined by Mr. Pycraft, of the Natural
History Museum, and a valuable article on the subject from his pen will
appear in our next issue. Mrs. Johnstone has most kindly given me the
last egg laid by her Touracous, and a description of it will appear in the
Bulletin of the British Ornithologists&apos; Club. -- Ed.]

By Miss D. Hamilton.
From my earliest years I was taught to love all living
creatures But I was also told that it was cruel to keep birds in
cages, so that my first feathered pets came to me as it were by
accident.
The first bird I ever possessed was one of a pair of per-
forming Bullfinches which my mother bought because she
thought they were being cruelly coerced into showing off their
accomplishments. I cannot remember that they did any tricks
while with us, but I was very small then, and I may have
forgotten.
The next bird to join our family circle was a one-legged
Coal-tit. He (and a pair of white rats) was given to my sister
and me by a young Genevese gentleman who was going to
America, and had to leave his pets behind. He had rescued the
bird from a trap some months before. It was very tame, and he
told us to feed it on bread and milk and crushed hemp seed,
which we did, nothing doubting, and the bird throve!
Fortunately, being so tame, we let him out a good deal, both in
the rooms and in the greenhouse, so no doubt he found food for
himself, more to his own liking. I well remember how, in the
summer holidays, we children got more invitations to tea than
ever before, and each one said " Please bring your bird with you,
our chalet is black with flies." So Timothy went in his cage, and
had a good tea like the rest of us. Poor bird--he had a tragic
end, tlio', in a way, a natural one. Besides our bird and rats we
took back with us to Geneva a pair of marmots which a friendly
guide had captured for us during our holiday in the Alps. The
Coal-tit was loose in the greenhouse, and so were the marmots,
and one of them made a meal of him. We never cared for the
marmots after that, so we gave them to Mr. Rothschild's game-
keeper, who was a kind and much envied friend of ours at that
time : envied because of all the wonderful animals he had the
care of, and which we were allowed to visit on our Thursday
half-holidays.
Another of the pets of our youth was some great Hawk

or Eagle, which I have never been able to identify. My sister
says it was a Buzzard. One day a little village boy arrived with
it, tied up in a large cotton handkerchief. My mother rated him
soundly for robbing a bird's nest, but he declared he found the
young bird at the foot of a pine tree, at the top of which was the
nest from which it had fallen. The tree was too tall and straight
for him to climb, so that he could not possibly put the baby back.
Willy-nilly we had to take it and do our best for it. It was the
size of a good big Brahma pullet, and covered with white down.
Its eyes were golden, and its feet bright yellow. My sister got
an empty packing case which she half filled with hay, and in
that, with a well covered hot water bottle on each side of it, the
baby seemed comfortable enough. It was fed on bread and milk,
and bits of raw meat and liver, and it throve and grew apace.
My sister kept it in its box near the stove in her bedroom. My
room opened out of hers, and had a window facing east. Every
morning, no sooner did the sun appear over the Dent du Midi,
than the bird came hopping along the floor straight to my bed,
upon which he flew, and perched on my chest. There he would
sit, gazing unblinkingly straight up at the sun. I always thought
he was a fire-worshipper, saying his prayers, and to this day I
can't think what else he was doing. He never meant to hurt me,
but the weight of his body drove his sharp claws through my
skin, and I used to call to my sister to take her Bird-o'-freedom
away. As soon as his breakfast was prepared he would cease his
devotions and go of himself. As he grew older we feared he
might become really dangerous. One morning I had three
young rabbits in my room, in a box with a wire top. Bird-o'-
freedom heard or smelt them, and flew from my bed, screaming,
and striking again and again with his great sharp claws on the
lid of the box, flapping his wings violently the while. The poor
rabbits squealed with terror, and buried themselves in their
straw. I, too, was terrified, and after that my mother ordered that
Bird-o'-freedom must be confined. He had a strong light dog-
chain fastened to his leg and round the balcony rail, so that he
could, by dragging his chain, get up and down the whole length
of the balcony. Then began magnificent combats between Birdo
and a great long-haired gray cat of ours, called Gladstone.

Miss D. Hamilton,
Gladstone was fierce and strong and loved raw meat as much as
Birdo did, and always tried to steal his share. Both hissed and
bit and struck with their claws, but neither ever seriously hurt
the other. That year my sister and I came to England, and our
parents chloroformed poor Birdo, as they dared not let him free.
The peasants said he would devour all their fowls and kids, and
\0x25A0even possibly, their children. Birdo was a wonderfully hand-
some and intelligent fellow. His full plumage was reddish brown,
speckled with darker brown, and his tail barred with black.
One of the birds which I used to see at Mr. Rothschild's,
and which I coveted more than any, was a Crossbill. But it was
not till years afterwards, when I came to London, that I had one
of my own. My first London bird, however, was a Robin.
Coming up Great St. Andrew Street, on my way from Charing
Cross one day, in the window of a cagemaker's shop I saw a
filthy cage containing four dead Robins and one miserable live
one--there was not a particle of food nor a drop of water in the
cage. Burning with indignation I burst into the shop, and
boldly began haranguing a yellow-haired dirty old Jew who was
working therein. " How dared he be so cruel ? A Robin too ! of
all birds! " The old man looked surprised. He said he was
" a poor, hard-working man, who had no time to look after birds
properly. He had been extra busy to-day, because his wife was
ill, so perhaps he had forgotten to feed the birds. Missey could
have the Robin, if she liked, for a shilling, and a beautiful cage
to keep it in for five shillings more." In those days my pocket
money didn't run to six shillings, so I paid one shilling for the
bird, and carried it home in a paper bag. Once home I let it fly
in my study, and gave it water and bread and milk ; but it flew
on to the tea table and ate the butter ravenously, much to my
surprise. It lived for some months with me, perching on the tops
of my books, or hiding behind them. It lived on bread and
milk and " Lark food " and, I suppose, on what flies and spiders
it could pick up for itself.
I soon had more birds than the Robin. Whether it was in
the vain hope of converting the yellow-haired old Jew from the
error of his ways, or because he knew many things about
birds which I did not, I cannot say, but certain it is that

a Blue-tit, and a Hawfinch took up their abode with me ;
and last, but not least, a Crossbill, glorious in his red plumage,
and singing a sweet little song. Of all my then birds (excepting
the Robin, who was cheeky and confiding, as is their wont,
and the Blue-tit, whose life was alas ! a very brief one) the
Crossbill was far and away my favourite. For him, week by
week, my sisters in Switzerland used to send me packets of
fir-cones (the two-penny sample post was still in existence then)
and I was never tired of watching him force them open, and
take out the tiny seeds, with his strange beak, so wonderfully
adapted to the purpose. He could gnaw wood like any Parrot,
and quite spoiled the beauty of his mahogany cage. When I had
had him about a year he moulted, and tho' his new feathers came
sleek and bright they were a sage-green colour instead of the
brilliant red they had been before. The bird seemed as well as
ever at that time, and I was told the change in colour occurs
even in wild birds. I wonder if that is so? and why? Besides
the fir cones, my Crossbill was exceedingly fond of hemp and
sunflower seed, and I fear I may have given him too much of
them. For, to my great sorrow, the poor bird seemed to have
some brain attack, which left him blind, and paralysed in both
his feet. He could not perch, and when he tried to move he only
went round and round in a circle. For weeks he lived on the
floor of his cage, his seed scattered in a ring round him, and a
shallow drinking pan close by. At last, when I had to leave
home, and could not take the bird with me, sooner than trust
him to the tender mercies of servants -who might forget his
needs, I chloroformed him myself. His plumage was perfect,
and he was quite fat.
Up to this time I had kept none but British birds owing
to the fact that all my summer holidays were spent in Switzerland,
and I could not take my birds with me. Therefore, at the
beginning of the summer, I used to take them into the country,
as far from human habitation as I could, and there let them fly.
My father usually accompanied me on these expeditious, which
were always most enjoyable to me, and I hope to the birds also.

34 On Breeding Passerme Parrotlets.
BREEDING PASSERINE PARROTLETS.
By John Watson.

Having had the good fortune to rear a nest of Passerine or
Blue-winged Parrakeets, the Editor has asked me to write a
short paper on the subject.
This charming Parrotlet is a very desirable aviary bird.
When at rest it is, perhaps, not very striking, but, flying in
sunshine, the vivid blue patches on rump and wings combine
with his otherwise grass green plumage to make a decided
impression. He is gentle--harmless even to the smallest Wax-
bills--never noisy, becomes fairly tame and, unlike most others
of his order, does not destroy the trees or shrubs in the aviary.
My pair were put into an aviary with various small birds
in 1902, and until June of this year showed no signs of breeding,
or rather I should say I saw nothing to excite my suspicions,
for they are very shy birds, and will sit as if turned to stone if
watched, but, directly they are unobserved, will fly about and
chatter merrily.
I11 June, however, I noticed the cock feeding his mate,
and, so that they should not be disturbed by prying and meddle-
some Zebra and other small Finches, I moved them to another
aviary which they shared with Virginian Cardinals and Yellow-
headed Troupials.
On July 8th there was one egg in a cocoa-nut husk.
O11 July 20th, after a few days' absence, I found the hen
sitting and took advantage of her going off to feed, to find that
she had eight eggs. She probably began to sit on the 17th July.
On August 6th there were six young birds, destitute of any sort
of covering. Apparently incubation takes about eighteen days.
As soon as any feathers began to grow, the blue tips of
some of the wing feathers proclaimed that the majority of the
brood were cocks.
On August 22ud, as the nest was dirty, and there was such
a crowd that the hen could not get in for house-cleaning, I
took out all the youngsters and scraped out the husk, put rings
on the birds, and put them back.
On August 31st the first young cock was flying well and

four days later the whole brood were out, but the last, and
apparently the youngest, two, are weak flyers (September ioth).
The hen did all the incubation and feeding.
The only distinction between the parents and the young
is, apparently, that the beaks of the latter have a pinkish tinge.
The food taken during rearing consisted of bread and
milk (boiled), fresh ants' eggs, an occasional taste of orange,
hemp, canary, and millet seeds and millet spray, but chiefly
bread and milk and hemp.
The old birds have never taken any interest in any sort of
green food, but are particularly fond of plantain heads. Before
breeding I never knew them take any other food than canary
and millet seed and occasionally a bit of apple.*
THE YELLOW BUDGERIGAR.
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I have often asked people about Budgerigars, and I have
always got some such reply as this: ' In order to get good
breeding results you want a big flock; a single pair will never
do any good.' Now I have been told so many queer things, and
have read still queerer in books, that while not going perhaps
quite so far as David as to say that ' all men are liars,' (I mean,
of course, 'bird men') yet I think that a good many have the
habit, as an old woman once said to me, of 'walking round the
truth.' I argued thus : Most birds, when breeding, like a place
to themselves and are very jealous of intruders. Why should
Budgerigars be an exception?! May not want of success in
breeding with a single pair be due to other causes? Stupidity
in management, bad nesting accommodation, or a hundred other
things? At any rate, I determined to try with one pair, just
from sheer cussedness. It is not everyone that can afford a
&apos;Blackberries are now greedily eaten. I supply them on the stalks in a bottle of water.--J.W.
+ Most aviculturists know that single pairs of Budgerigars will breed quite success-
fully, in fact we have even known a pair to breed in a large cage; but the fact remains
that, being naturally gregarious, they will breed often with greater success, when two or
more pairs are kept in the same place.--E d.

36 Rev. C. D. Farrar,
flock of Yellow Budgerigars at twenty-five or thirty shillings a
pair.
I was fortunate to secure a pair of lovely birds, just over
the moult, and ' as tight as wax,' as Canary men say. Now, from
past sad experience, I knew how easy it is to mistake a pair of
old birds for young ones, especially when the latter are twelve
months old. I once sold a most prolific and certain breeding
hen Bengalee, intending to part with her daughter, and could
never get her back again, though I charmed as wisely, so I
thought, as the proverbial snake catcher. The lady to whom I
sold her politely regretted my mistake, but elected to stick to
her bargain ; but then ladies are so unreasonable !
I made up my mind then to ' ring ' my old Budgerigars, to
avoid future complications. To say that they objected to the
process, is to put the matter mildly. They bit, they swore, they
did everything short of taking off the offending leg. I was firm
however. I said, 'My dear birds, it is all for your good,' as the
farmer said to the pig when he was ringing him. After a few
days they appeared reconciled to the inevitable. The process
of ringing is quite simple when you know how. In catching
Parrakeets, always mind and keep your attention on his head,
that's his busi?iess end : the wings and feet which are clawing
around your wrist don't matter. Well, then, mind the head with
one part of your hand, get hold of a leg with the other and slip
on the ring as quick as you can. His majesty will use some
very unparliamentary language. Never mind, let him go, and
apologise afterwards.
I placed the Budgerigars in a nice little aviary all to
themselves, and then awaited results. I had not long to try my
patience. The great aim of a Budgerigar's life seems to be
strictly Scriptural, to increase and multiply the Budgerigar
earth.
In feeding he is no epicure. All he demands is plain
sensible food. For choice he likes white millet, best Spanish
canary, and a bit of my soft food mixture when there are babies
about. He does not like bread and milk, or bread and water,
or any other strange and fearsome compound recommended by
learned societies and doctors.

The courting as with us humans, is interspersed with a
reasonable amount of quarrelling--which I will call euphemisti-
cally, amantium ircz! The cock, as is just and proper, makes
the first advances. He begins by coming, like the historic
spider of the story, ' to sit down beside her.' This little
proceeding does not always answer, as poor Master B. has to
suddenly have a ' call elsewhere,' as Dissenting preachers say to
their flocks. After a bit, the lady grows more amenable to
discipline, and Mr. B. tries a little singing. His voice is a bit
harsh and grating : I know he is called poetically 'the Warbling
Grass Parrakeet,' but somehow his voice reminds me of sounds
I once heard issuing from a miner's cottage. After the poor
little hen has got used to the inevitable, the cock proceeds to
offer her sundry tit-bits from his beak. These she at first
indignantly refuses, but after a while thinks better of it, and
accepts what he offers in a spirit of meekness and with a ready
mind.
Eggs are now not far off. A few days will see the hen a
bit thick and puff}&amp;quot;; then she will disappear into the nest, and, if
all be right, emerge some fine morning as though nothing had
happened. To attain this desirable end, it is most important to
give a good supply of cuttle-fish bone, both powdered and in the
piece. If this be neglected there will be a nice corpse to bury.
The eggs are deposited every other day, and are generally
five or six in number, and consequently when hatched the young
are of very various ages, the eldest born in the case of six eggs
being ten days ahead of his unfortunate younger brother Jacob.
This does not seem to matter, as they all come right in the end.
In nesting I find Budgerigars of accommodating spirit.
I was going to say they will nest anywhere. I think they prefer
a good roomy cocoa-nut husk, hung up long ways and with the
hole at the top: but I have had equally good results in a
box with a properly constructed hollow in the bottom.
Budgerigars will delight anyone who loves to look at the
pretty nests. We are told that some birds do not mind their
family arrangements being inspected. The only bird that I
know of who does not object is the Budgerigar: but do not go
too far, even with him. He will allow you to lift down the husk

and peep inside, but farther than that I never ventured. I do
not even know whether all Budgerigars will submit thus far, but
mine know me well and look upon me as a ' necessary evil ' !
When the young are aboard there must be a constant
supply of green food--ripe groundsel and flowering grass, the
latter for preference. I believe that with all Parrakeets (and I
have bred as many as most people) this is a sine qua ?io?i when
there are youngsters.
It is a very funny sight to see the feeding. For about
five days the hen does everything, and woe betide the gentleman
Budgerigar if he ventures near the nest. I notice that for some
days after a hatch Master B., like Agag, ' goes delicately,' and
often departs with a flea in his ear.
After a week the lady thinks better of her conduct, and
seems to realize, with the usual inconsequence of the sex, that
the gentleman is perhaps a ' necessary evil.' She evidently
informs him that there are babies in the husk and asks him why
he is idling around instead of attending to his duties and feeding
his family? Like a wise married man, the poor fellow says
nothing, but pops down to the seed-tray and begins to eat as if
there were no hereafter. Farly and late he visits the nest, but
his labours are never done. Like the daughters of the horse
leech, those youngsters ever cry ' More ! more ! ' For three
weeks he seems to spend most of his days apparently standing
on his head in the husk. I conclude he is feeding, by the
issuing sounds, but it seems a parlous proceeding to a mere
human. At last there comes a morning when No. i emerges
from the nest. Proud and happy are the fond parents as they
ply him with dainties. At intervals of a few days the other
little beauties come forth to be admired. Their color is faint
primrose. In the last nest there were three. *
* Since the above was written I have four more nearly ready to leave the nest.--C. D. F.

By Mrs. Howard Williams.
About thirteen years ago we gave lip keeping Canaries in
favour of foreign birds. We began, as so many people do, with
a fine large Crystal Palace aviary, into which we put any little
foreigners which struck our fancy. The tiny finches attracted
us greatly, but all sorts shared the cage, until by degrees
we learned which varieties did best with us, and which were
desirable companions. Eventually we gave the Palace aviary
and its varied contents to a friend, and bought in its place a
large flight cage, in which we kept some Pekin Robins. We
found these otherwise charming birds a little trying in a sitting-
room, they were so persistently cheerful and noisy, and the
continual thump, thump, thump, as they joyfulty jumped down
their three perches with shouts of glee proved more than we
could endure.
We then had a small aviary built, standing on short legs,
made entirely of wood including a high gable roof, and wired
only in front. This was put in a west verandah, where the
Pekin Robins and a few other hardy birds spent a winter, and
were in high spirits and condition. I should add that on cold
nights a green baize curtain was drawn over the front.
The now empty flight cage was again brought into use,
when a pair of Bicheno Finches arrived. They were said to
have been in this country two years, and I was anxious to have
them as several newly-imported specimens had died, to my great
disappointment. This pair not only lived, but proceeded to
build a nest in their rush sleeping basket, and succeeded in
rearing a healthy family in a sitting-room where children were
constantly running about, and where the aspect left much to be
desired from a bird's point of view.
About this time we moved the aviary into the conserva-
tory and added some Gouldian Finches to our collection, and
some other Australian birds, and finding they did very well
there, a second aviary was made exactly like the first, but rather
larger. I suspect that the reason our birds have done well on
the whole in a conservatory may be that the aviaries are made

entirely of wood, including the high gable roof, and wired only
in front, and therefore the birds have more protection from the
fierceness of the sun shining on glass, than many do where
living in conservatories. Besides this, we take care to have no
plants there which require much moisture. We keep the larger
aviary for the larger birds, principally Australian finches, and
the smaller for the Waxbills and tiny finches.
One pair of Long-tailed Grassfinches fully reared thirty
birds in two years. The hen is now dead, but the cock still
survives, and has nested again this year with a new mate. They
have generally chosen a husk for a nest, but sometimes they
have preferred a travelling cage with the front taken out. We
always notice that the nestlings are very much crowded, and sit
in a tight row, beaks outwards, and tails sticking up behind, and
are most shabby, untidy little things when they emerge from
their nest.
Some years ago I had one pair of Bronze-winged Manni-
kins and a pair of Bib Finches. One of each pair died, and the
survivors mated, rearing several broods of hybrids. They were
more like Bibs than Mannikins, but as they were neither pretty
nor sweet tempered we parted with them to a dealer. I regret to
say that my husband, going in later, saw some of the youngsters
marked at a high price, and with a long and original name
evolved out of the dealer's inner consciousness, awaiting the
confiding and unsuspecting amateur in search of rare birds !
Our Bichenos have nested with no fuss or trouble what-
ever. We had several broods in the before-mentioned flight
cage, and many in the aviary. But just when Bichenos and
Ringed Finches were nesting most successfully an unfortunate
lamp accident happened in the conservatory one cold night in
late spring. The fumes killed twelve birds of these two varieties
alone, of every age and size; and I have had no luck with them
since.
We have kept many Gouldians, but they have nested only
twice with us. The first brood consisted of five youngsters, but
they were killed by a red-headed cock in a fit of jealousy. We
parted with him in haste, and the next season the black-headed
birds hatched two young ones. Of the two the hen died at

seven months old, still in her baby plumage ; the other, a fine
healthy cock, has blossomed out into a red-headed bird. Of
course one knew, from Dr. Butler's book, that the two varieties
were produced indiscriminately, but it seemed a little difficult to
realize until one saw the red-headed son sitting beside the black-
headed father. They are great friends, and since the hen's
death the two are always together.
We have reared a Cherry-finch, a beautiful little hen;
some Bronze-winged Mannikins, a Diamond Sparrow, and some
Red-faced Finches. The Red-faced Finches, now about three
months old, were quite unlike their parents on leaving the nest,
except that the shape of beak and skull were the same. They
were well-feathered, beautifully neat, slender in shape, and the
general effect of their colouring was soft brown. They were
quite without any trace of red on face or beak, neither had they
any white spots on breast or throat.
We have this spring started a garden aviary, and all the
birds were turned into it for the summer mouths. Their health
has been very good, but I do not think the breeding results will
prove to be very great. The Golden-breasted Waxbills have
made a nest and laid eggs, but failed to hatch. The Cordon-
bleus -went so far as to hatch at least one egg, but the little bird
died, owing probably to a cold wet week. The Dong-tailed
Grassfinches have nested.
I am writing away from home and do not know just how
matters are at this moment, but I hear that the Yellow
Sparrows appear to have built a nest, and also that they are
eager for mealworms, a dainty I have never known them to look
at before.* I have two pairs, and both cocks are in beautiful
plumage, the yellow being quite canary colour in their case. I
fancy they are more than usually sensitive to light, for when
they were kept for a time in a dull position the yellow faded a
good deal, especially on the head.
I hope next season to have some good breeding results out
of doors to chronicle, instead of a list of nests and unhatched
eggs ; but wet weather coming at a critical time has accounted
for several desertions on the part of sitting hens, and a Pin-
Mrs, Howard Williams has now successfully reared young- o {Passer luteus. --ISd.

By far the most important addition, in the way of birds
at least, that has been made to the Society's Collection for many
years is the couple of King Birds of Paradise which arrived
there on October 15th from Mrs. Johnstone's aviaries. Although
not in perfect plumage they appear to be in splendid health, and
promise to do well. I believe these are the first examples of the
King Bird of Paradise ever brought to Europe alive. They
occupy one of the aviaries at the back of the Insect House, and
cannot fail to prove a very great attraction.
In last month's Zoo. Notes I made a mistake when I
stated that the pair of Wharton's Fruit-Pigeons had hatched
a young bird. They showed signs of nesting, but nothing came
of it. It was the Imperial Nicobar Fruit-Pigeons (Carpophaga
insularis) that had hatched, but I hear that the young bird has
died. The pair of Brush Bronzewing Pigeons (Phaps elega?is)
in the Southern Pheasantry have at length succeeded in
hatching, and so far rearing, a pair of young ones. D. S.-S.

nest, but in the inability of a finch--a bird that feeds its young, and mate,
on food regurgitated from the crop--to feed another young bird whose
parents drop the food into its widely gaping mouth. If anyone will watch
a pair of Canaries in the task, or duty, of attending to the requirements of
their offspring, it will be seen that the old Canary holds its beak at right
angles to that of the chick, and that the latter helps itself to the aliment
and does not have it thrust down its throat as is the case with the pseudo-
finches. A Canary will rear the young of any other finch as readily as it
will its own, but the birds experimented with by Professor Scott are
Sparrows, and not finches, hence the failure.
I have experimented at different times with eggs of finches, e. g.
Linnets, Goldfinches, and Greenfinches, all of which my Canaries reared
successfully though they failed with Chaffinches and Cardinals.
It would be desirable to restrict the appellation FINCH to birds
that, like the Canary, feed their 3&apos;oung and mate with food regurgitated
from the crop, and the difference not only in the mode of supplying food
but in the form of the mouth of the respective young is sufficient to
warrant the separation of the two classes of birds from each other. A
Sparrow might be taken as the type of the non-regurgitating class, and a
Canary of the other.
To briefly summarize the matter: it is impossible for a finch, using
the word in its natural and restricted sense, to feed a non-finch successfully,
as it is for the latter to rear a finch, and that from difference in the mode of
supplying the food on the part of the old birds, as well as from inability 011
the part of the young to receive it. W. T. Greene.
[We should be glad to hear what our members have to say on this
subject. Our own impression is that most if not all of the finches (and
we include in this term all those birds which Dr. Greene calls pseudo-
finches) feed their young from the crop in the same way as Canaries, for the
first week or two of their lives at any rate.--E d.]
THE NESTING HABITS OF BRUSH TURKEYS.
Sir, --I was glad to see in your Magazine that two Brush-Turkeys
(Catheturus lathami ) had been hatched in the London Zoo., and I also hope
that those at Woburn Abbey will also be successful.
We have hatched and reared young birds here for some years past,
rarely missing a season, and I wrote an account of them in the Ibis, 1S99,
page 9. The Woburn Abbey birds and those in the London Zoo. were
reared in these Gardens, and we have some young birds in hand now.
The nesting habits of mound builders are always of interest, as for
instance, how they can tell when the mound is of sufficient heat to lay in :
but I think I have found a clue to that.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
Sir, --In the August number of the Magazine, Mr. Bertling gives an
interesting account of the opening by the Garden authorities of the Brush
Turkey's mound at the Zoological Gardens.
I, too, feeling sure that no chicks were going to emerge from the
mound which my birds had raised, decided early in September to pull it to
pieces. I found seven eggs, deposited much as Mr. Bertliug describes,
about fifteen inches from the present base of the heap (which of course had
settled a great deal), and about a yard from the interior. Three appeared
to be unfertile, three seemed to have contained embryos which had
perished at an early stage, while one chick had hatched but had failed to
escape from the mound. Probably, as in the case at Regent's Park, the
heap had become too compact; but I think that in my case, in addition,
the female had not laid her later eggs soon enough, and the heap had
cooled before their incubation had far advanced.
I quite think that the materials supplied should be of a loose and
open nature. (In my case I supplied much grass from the lawn-mowers,
which I think now was a mistake). But if Mr. Bertling provides, as lie
proposes, a large quantity of dead leaves, I should fear that there will be
no fermentation, which of course is indispensible.

THE RED-BACKED SHRIKE.
Sir, --Dr. Gunther's interesting article on the breeding of the Red-
backed Shrike in captivity should I think not be passed over with no
further comment than the breeding of many foreign species calls for,
inasmuch as it has established one or two points which have hitherto not
been fully recognized by students of British birds.
In the "History of British Birds" by the late Henry Seebohm (Vol.
II. p. 607), that author argued that our common Butcher-bird impaled
insects upon thorns because the feet of Shrikes were not sufficiently
powerful to grasp their prey until torn in pieces by the sharply toothed
bill. That this was an error I always suspected, and Dr. Gunther has
effectually disposed of it by his observation that this bird does use its claws
in grasping its prey whilst pulling it to pieces.
In the case of soft insects like Cockroaches I pointed out (British
Birds with their Nests and Eggs, Vol. II. p. 10 footnote) that no less than
five full-grown specimens were swallowed entire : it would therefore seem
that hard-cased insects were probably dismembered rather to render them
more easily digestible, than to reduce their size; or perhaps, because a hard
insect of the same size as a full-grown cockroach might injure the tissues
of the oesophagus in its passage.
That small feet are not necessarily weak, is evident to anyone who

has handled a Blue-tit; the claws of which bird grasp one's finger like steel
springs.
Dr. Gunther has emphasized another point which I hinted at (t. c.
p. 11):--the importance of hand-rearing the Butcher-bird, in order to
reconcile it to captivity. My own bird was caught isoon after it had left
the nest; yet it was so wild, that it quickly ruined its plumage; and
though it ate voraciously, it did not live long. A. G. BuTEER.
Sir,--I can endorse all that Dr. Gunther says in his interesting
account of the breeding of the Red-backed Shrike, as to the desirability of
the Shrikes as aviary birds.
I have repeatedly reared the young of Grey Shrikes, notably
Lanius algeriensis , L. dealbatus, and L. hcemitecicurus, and find them most
docile, affectionate, and interesting. I fancy they require a good deal of
room, or at any rate a certain amount of liberty, and one I had in England
used to fly at liberty for hours and hunt for himself: he would, however,
come a quarter-of-a-mile to a certain whistle.
The habit of leaving the nest before they can fly is also common to
the Grey Shrikes, who leave the nest and squat and creep about long before
they can even perch. And at this early period they warble inwardly; and
it is curious to see the young being fed by the parents and then settle down
in the nest and begin to sing to themselves!
When abroad, I used principally to feed the Grey Shrikes on lizards
and grass-hoppers which were easily procurable : but here, at home,
mostly 011 Sparrows, mice, beetles, and mealworms--and they are very
large eaters. E. G. B. Meade-Waedo.
NOTES FROM TASMANIA.
Sir,--I n the May number of the Aviculturat Magazine I noticed an
interesting account of Sparrows building in Nile ferry boats, and perhaps
your readers might like a few words with reference to the nesting of a
pair of Welcome Swallows ( Hirundo neoxena) under somewhat similar
circumstances.
O11 the River Derwent we have some smart little steamers running
every half-hour between Hobart and Belleside, on the eastern shore. About
February, when voyaging across, I noticed Swallows flying about, when in
the middle of the stream, and now and then darting beneath the upper
deck. O11 arrival at my destination I asked my friend the cause of the
birds being so fearless. She replied that they had a nest in a crevice over
the cabin and between that and the upper deck, also close to a doorway
and an electric light. On going again a few weeks later I spoke to the
Captain, asking him if the young birds had been hatched ? He told me
that, to his disgust, some man had pulled the nest out with his walking
stick! (What senseless mischief!) Their nesting in such a place was

remarkable, owing to the constant stream of passengers going on and off,
and which continued until pretty late at night.
I also notice in the May number the letter of Mr. J. Viner Leeder,
making enquiries as to the hardiness of the Black Swan. Being natives of
Australia, and also of Tasmania, they may be considered very hardy. In
this State they appear to be getting more plentiful than they were, owing
possibly to efforts being made to preserve the young from wholesale
destruction. I have seen adult birds go about with the same freedom and
with no more attention than one would give to Geese. This year I have
had the chance of buying no less than three pairs at the initial cost of
per pair. It is the expense of transit that makes all birds so valuable when
lauded in England.

The following is an extract from a letter received from Mr. A. W.
Milligan, a well-known Australian ornithologist and field-naturalist:
" I have been very much interested in the notes on Australian birds
that have appeared in your Magazine, particularly those relating to the
Maluri and Pachycephala gutturalis. Whilst living in Victoria I kept
many of the native birds in captivity. I was never able to rear Menura
superba, although I made many attempts to do so. I had however
hybrids between the Lyre-bird and the common fowl, and exhibited
them at the Victoria Poultry Show many years ago."
Although the Lyre-birds were at one time thought to be related to
the Pheasants they are now known to be quite distinct from the galli-
naceous birds, and the production of such a hybrid is most extraordinary.
We hope to hear more on the subject. Ed.

I have a good-sized box cage containing about twenty birds of
various sorts -- Waxbills, Canaries, Nonpareils, a Paradise Whydah, a
Budgerigar, a Siskin, and a cock Zebra-finch. The latter has lately assisted
a little pair of Golden-breasted Waxbills during the incubation of their eggs,
and when the young birds were hatched continued to take his turn in sitting
and also in feeding them. I doubted his doing the latter until to-day,
when I saw him doing so more than once, the young birds having left the
nest yesterday. He is as proud of them as their parents, and spends his
time preening their feathers.
In colour the young birds are like their mother. They are, as near as
I can tell, about three weeks old, and are fully fledged and seem strong on
the wing, as one escaped from the cage this morning and flew about the
greenhouse in which the cage stands.
They have been brought up chiefly on spiders, as I gave the parents
several daily, in addition to their ordinary diet of seed and green food, with
an occasional mealworm, I provided them with soaked egg-flake once or
twice, but they did not touch it. The young birds look healthy and strong,
and I hope they will thrive. Do you consider my feeding of the parents
has been correct ?
Lippa de Yarburgh Bateson.
[Cases of unpaired birds feeding the young of other birds are not
rare, but are always interesting and worth recording. The fact of the
young Waxbills being successfully reared proves that there was not much
amiss with the feeding of the parents. --Hd.]
A FINFOOT IN CAPTIVITY.
Sir, --That most enterprising dealer, Mr. J. Hamlyn, has just brought
back with him from West Africa at the time of writing (October 15th) the
most remarkable bird that has been imported for many years. This is the
African Finfoot (Podica senegalensis), a member of a very little known family
numbering only three species, one African, one Asiatic, and one South
American. Their affinities are with the Rails. The present species looks
like a cross between a Cormorant and a Rail, having the bill and wings of
the latter, with the lobed toes of a Coot, and the general form of the
Cormorant, even to the long stiff tail and saw-edged middle claw--a most
remarkable instance of parallelism in development. I11 size it about equals a
Crow, and is greenish-slate in general colour with small white spots and a
white belly; the feet are bright coral red. It is to be regretted that this
extraordinary creature did not survive long, as so very little is known about
the habits of these curious birds that all details are of value.
Mr. Hamlyn states that the bird was fed on raw meat; it was the
survivor of several, and he found the species common at Sette Cama.

Sir, --Mr. Horton and I, in our joint letter which appeared in your
issue for October, were careful to avoid personalities; and I think it is to
be regretted that you have not followed a like course in your reply. But,
evidently feeling that little could be said in defence of the new rules on
their merits, you follow the proverbial advice to the advocate with "no
case," and "abuse the plaintiff's attorney." I shall not reply to this
personal attack, for the question at issue is not that of my delinquencies
{real or imaginary) but that of the policy embodied in the new rules.
Nevertheless, as you have introduced the Foreign Bird Club into the
discussion, I feel that I should be wanting in my duty to the Club of which
I have the honour to be one of the Secretaries, if I did not correct some of
your misrepresentations concerning it.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.887139916666667" page_id="32656492"  page_num="48" year="" vol="">
1. It is not correct, as you assert, that I " started a new Society " in
1901. The F.B.C. had existed, under another name, since 1S98.
2. It is not correct, as you assert, that " a number of our members
deserted us to join the F.B.C." I believe that those who did this could be
numbered on the fingers of one hand.
3. It is not correct, as you assert, that " as a special inducement
members of the Avicultural Societv 7 were allowed to join the F.B.C. without
paying an entrance fee." There was no entrance fee to the F.B.C. until
the present year, and all new members and associates have to pay this.
4. It is not correct, as you insinuate, that efforts were made to
induce members to leave the Avicultural Society. I challenge you to prove
even a single instance in which any official of the F.B.C. advocated or

suggested such a course. About half of the members of the F.B.C. have
always been members also of the Avicultural Society, and they include
among them j^ourself and Mr. Newman and a large proportion of the more
active and devoted members of the Society.
I am very far from suggesting that the original rules were perfect. I
have the less hesitation in saying this, because I was mainly responsible
for them. They were drawn up before the Society started upon its career,
at a time when it was uncertain what form it would ultimately assume.
These rules undoubtedly required revision, but they should have been re-
vised in a different spirit and with a different object. Every effort should
have been made to increase the interest of the members in the working of
the Society, to broaden the basis of its government, and to add to the
number of members who take part in its management. From the very
beginning, the Societ}&apos; has suffered from its affairs being too much in the
hands of a very small number of men. This was tolerable, and perhaps
unavoidable, at first, but as the Society grew and prospered, and the
number of members willing and anxious to share in the government in-
creased, it became more and more objectionable. The membership of the
Council ought, in my opinion, to be increased to 20 or 24, meetings of the

Council should be held more frequently than they are at present, the
Executive Committee should be abolished, and such of the work as must
be performed by Committee should be divided among several Committees,
ou one or the other of which each member of the Council (willing to serve)
should have a seat.
The system of government by a small Executive Committee has been
the cause of jealousy and dissatisfaction, and the origin of cabals and
secret manoeuvres, almost from the beginning of the Society. It is time it
was done away with.
I see no objection to the compulsory retirement of two or more
members of the Council each year, without being eligible for immediate
re-election ; but I do object to the system of official candidates for the
vacancies, and the rule that requires that fifteen members must object to
the official candidates, and propose others in their place. Any two mem-
bers ought to be able to propose and second candidates, and the} 7 should be
able to do this without formally objecting to other candidates. One may
greatly prefer A to B, without having any positive objection to B. I know
from experience that to obtain fifteen signatures involves a good deal of
correspondence, and the formal objection to the official candidates is re-
garded as offensive and personal. The object of the rule appears to be to
make opposition to the official candidates as difficult as possible--indeed,
in the case of Mr. Horton and myself, the Hon. Business vSecretary con-
tended that all the signatures to the objection must be on one paper, in
spite of the fact that to obtain fifteen signatures in fifteen days is a practical
impossibility when all the signatories reside in different neighbourhoods !
(This farcical construction of the rule was ultimately abandoned). It
cannot be to the advantage of the Society that the majority of the Council
should be able to prevent the election to their body of any person whom
the majority of the members wish to elect. In course of time it might
come about that the whole of the Council should be representative of one
school while four-fifths of the members adhere to another--or that some
dominating personality, by securing the election of his own supporters,
should practically rule the Society, in defiance of the members.
It is because Mr. Horton and I " have the best interests of the Society
at heart " that we are desirous of checking the bureaucratic policy recently
inaugurated. If, as you suggest, we, and those who think with us, were
desirous of wrecking the Society, our wisest course would be to stand aside
and allow the ship to drift upon the rocks.
* Horatio R. Fitemer.
[A great deal can be said in defence of the new rules, and especially,
we think, of the new rule relating to the election of the Council. Formerly
any member could get nominated to the Council without any difficulty, and
when the list of candidates was published the majority of the members had
not the slightest idea who to vote for, and there was a great danger of most

unsuitable candidates being elected. As we stated in the last number of
our Magazine, the Council necessarily know who are the most suitable
members to take the place of the two retiring much better than the
majority of the members can possibly know, and they are unquestionably
the body to recommend the new candidates. If such a rule were not a
good one it would not be, and have been for very many years, in force in
most of the best societies of the countiw.
Mr. Fillmer says it is not correct that he " started a new Society in
1901." Whether the "Foreign Bird Club" was called a new Society, or
whether it was considered to be the "Foreign Bird Exhibitors' League"
under a new name makes little difference : at any rate it changed its
nature and started a magazine of its own, on almost the same lines as
the Avicultural Magazine. We find, on reference to the first number of
Bird Notes that the special reduction to members of the Avicultural Society
was only in force when the F.B.C. was known as the Foreign Bird Ex-
hibitors' League, and we therefore withdraw the statement that "as a
special inducement members of the Avicultural Society were allowed to
join without paying an entrance fee."
We certainly did not state that efforts were made to induce members
to leave the Avicultural Society, but that every inducement was offered to
our members to join theF.B.C., and as a natural consequence of this several
of our members did leave 11s to join the new Society, or the Society with a
new name and a new magazine.
As to the suggestion that the Council should be increased to 20 or 24,
this seems to us to be impracticable, and considering that the members are
scattered over the length and breadth of the laud, and that the Society has
no meeting room, the idea of frequent meetings, desirable as these would
be, is out of the question.--E d.]
To the Hon. Business Secretary.
Sir,--I should like to express my views on this question raised by
Mr. Fillmer's letter and the Editor's remarks thereon in the last issue of
the Society's Magazine.
I write in no carping spirit and trust I shall not be condemned as a
"malcontent" simply from my inabilit}&apos; to agree in toto with the actions of
those directly responsible for the management. Personally I appreciate to
the fullest extent the efforts of the present Council, and more particularly
those of the gentlemen forming the Executive Committee, to make the
Society and its Magazine a success ; and I unhesitatingly admit that it is in
consequence of their admirable administration that we have such a satis-
factory production each month as is the latter.
But however much I may admire the devotion and self-sacrifice of
those referred to, I am opposed to the adoption of unconstitutional methods
to secure even that which I may be disposed to admit is the best for the

Society ; and I submit that in the alteration of one or two of the rules
hitherto governing it, they infringed on the prerogative of the general body
of the members.
I am more particularly concerned with the ruleiwhicli has practically
placed the election of the Council in the hands of the existing members of
that body. To me it appears somewhat " Gilbertian " that members
originally elected to serve on the Council for a specific term, should proceed
to alter the conditions of their tenure of office without reference to the
members of the Society, and this is my reason for using the term
" unconstitutional methods."
That I am not far wrong is evidenced by the remarks of a learned
Judge in a case before the High Courts recently. Where the Directorate of
some Company had inter alia enlarged their term of office without the
sanction of the shareholders. I forget the exact circumstances, but I
remember at the time I read it, I concluded there was a parallel in the case
in point.
I further wish to express my regret that the Committee should have
bracketed two names of candidates for election on the voting paper issued
with the October number, with the note, "recommended by the Council."
This to me appears to be a violation of the traditions governing a vote by
ballot, and I am sure it would have been in better taste had the paper
contained nothing but the names of candidates in alphabetical order.
In conclusion I wish it to be clearly understood that in writing the
foregoing I have been entirely uninfluenced by the personal element which
too often enters into a discussion of this nature. And I shall be glad if my
letter is published in our next journal with a view of testing the feelings
of the members on the question of principle involved by the Council's
action. Archibald Simpson.
The Ho?i. Business Secretary&apos;s Reply.
Sir, --Your letter received this morning. I am sorry you think
that the Council have acted unconstitutionally in altering the rule re-
garding the election of that body. I should like to point out to you that
the Council were only acting in accordance with Rule 11 (on the copy
enclosed).
You will see that Rule 9, paragraph 2, does not fix the term of office
at one or even two years, but allows two years to pass without an election,
and when that election does take place, does not exclude the existing
Council from another term of office.
The Rule as amended last June makes provision for at least two of
the Council being new every year, thus giving members a greater chance of
showing their approval or disapproval of the existing Council by voting
either for the Council's nominees or proposing different candidates. This

is the method of election which is employed by the Zoological and other
well known Societies.
With regard to the voting paper, it is usual to distinguish between
the Council's nominees and all others. I am certain that nothing personal
was meant by it.
Anyhow should you still desire your letter to be published, and will
let me know, I will forward it to the Editor. T. H. Newman.
To the Hon. Business Secretary.
Sir,--I am obliged by your courteous letter to hand. It is quite true,
as you remark, that provision is made by the Society's revised rules for the
introduction of ' new blood ' on the Council each year, and that nominations
may be made by the members. This is not however the point of contention
and I am afraid I am not quite understood.
What I wish to emphasize is,--the original rules of the Society so far
as concerns the election of the Council, cannot legally (if I may use the
term) be altered by the Council without a vote in favour of such alteration
being given by the members of the Society.
In regard to the Zoological Society's adoption of similar methods,
I am afraid this argument is rather against our CounciJ, It is quite true
what you say, but the difference is this, that the rules governing the
election of its officers were ratified by the Society as a body, and this of course
covers my whole argument. I think therefore the fairest way of dealing
with my last letter will be to send it to the Editor for publication, so that
members, if they wish it, may have an opportunity of expressing an
opinion on the matter, and so long as there is general satisfaction in the
camp, I am well satisfied ; but I am inclined to the belief that there are
many members who, whilst disagreeing with the Council's action, lack the
courage to make even a mild protest.
Of course I must be absolved from any desire to be vexatious, my
interest in the Avicultural Society is too healthy for anything of this nature.
Archibald Simpson.
[So far as we are aware the original Rules of the Avicultural Society
were ratified by the general body of the Society as it existed at the time
they were drafted, and those rules have clearly given the Council power
" to alter and add to the Rules from time to time in any manner they may
think fit.&amp;quot; It would seem therefore that if any mistake has been made
(which we do not admit) it was made by the original framers of the Rules.
However the Council do not pretend to be infallible, and, we are quite sure,
will welcome the opinion of our members. We would however ask those
who have anything to say on the subject to do so as soon as possible, as
the pages of the Magazine are intended for matters strictly connected with
birds, and this controversy can do little good to the journal if long
continued.

Post Mortem Examinations.
Californian Quail (Mrs. Charrington). Moulting into adult plumage
and seemed thin. Fed on canary, millet, wheat and dari, Abraham's
Mixture and a few mealworms. &apos;[Your bird died of inanition owing to
malassimilation of food. Keep in a grass run, not with Silver
Pheasants as you suggest, and feed on canary, millet, wheat, dari, and
hemp if birds appear thin. I was always very partial to Century Food
and some game meal. These birds are largely insectivorous].
Budgerigar (MissE. M. Crowliurst). [Your bird died of apoplexy. It is
very common for these birds to die in this way. My Budgerigars were
fed&apos;on equal parts canary and millet, and oats. There was always plenty
of mortar rubbish and a saucer of either Century Food or Lucullns in
the aviary. Green food when not wet or frosted].
bush Quail (Mr. H. L. Sich). [Answered by post].
Hen REDRUMP ParrakeET (Mrs. Williams). [Your bird died of an
apoplectic fit. Evidently she had one before you bought her from the
symptoms, and there was an old standing blood clot on the brain, in
addition to a recent one which caused death. I fed mine on canary
and millet, equal parts wheat, oats and dari, with either Century

Brown-headed Conure and Red-crested Cardinae (Major A. B.
Trestrail). [Answered by post. Thanks for P.O. 2/6].
Siskin (Mr. J. Bowes). Died suddenly. [Apoplexy],
Long-Tailed GRASSFINCH (Mr. Barber). Noticed a cock Bronze Mannikin
chasing it about yesterday. This bird was found dead to-day. [Con-
cussion of the brain caused death].
Cock Red-headed Gouedian Finch (Miss R. Lvou). In my possession
over six years, Found dying. [A lovely specimen, very fat. Died of
an apoplectic fit].
Cock Liothrin (Mr. Moerschell). Food : millet, hemp, and canary seed
first grade Century Food, dry ants' eggs, a couple of small beetles, or a
fat mealworm daily. [To my mind you feed your bird too liberally.
Second grade Century Food would be better for a Liothrix. They are
gross feeders. With this food he would not require either beetles or
mealworms. Cause of death was a fit].
Hoopoe (Mr. W. H. St. Quiutin). Always fed well. For three or four days
the feathers around vent have been stained, and its droppings were
green. [Inflammation of liver caused death. Owiug to malassimila-
tion the bird was much emaciated. Thanks for P.O. 2/6. Answered by
post].

Crimson Bishop (Mr. F. M. Abrahams). Fed 011 canary&apos; seed, Indian
millet, a little hemp, and an occasional mealworm. Thrived for over

Paradise Whydah. [Too decomposed].

Turacus macrorhynchus .
By W. P. Pycraft, A.T.S., F.Z.S., &amp;c.
I. Introduction.
So far as I am aware, until the publication of Mrs.
Johnstone's account of the partial rearing of the nestling of
Fraser's Touracou in her aviaries, in the November issue of our
Magazine, nothing was known of the condition of the young of
the Touracou at birth.
For the unique opportunity of describing the pterylologi-
cal characters of the nestling Touracou, as represented by the
present species, I am indebted to the kindness of my friend, Mr.
D. Seth-Smitli.
Before I proceed with my description I would remark that,
although, as I have said, nothing was hitherto known of the
condition of the young at birth in this group, yet certain definite
statements have appeared on this subject which now turn out to
have been mere conjectures.
Thus Seebohm, in his " Classification of Birds " placed the
Touracous with the Cuckoos in one order, " Coccyges," which he
diagnosed by the possession of four characters in common. Of
these four, one was based on the condition of the nestling, which,
he asserted was " born helpless, and not passing through a downy
stage before acquiring feathers." This definition now proves to
be true only of the Cuckoos.
Dr. Gadow, in Bronn's Thier-reichs (Systematischer theil)
appears to have followed Seebohm in this matter, since, in a table

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.995042815789474" page_id="32656512"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
Mr. P. W. Pycraft,
of characters distinguishing the Cuckoos and Touracous from
the Hoatzin, he defines the young of the former as perfectly
naked and nidicolous (echte nackte nesthocker).
Thus then, Mrs. Johnstone's success proves to be one of
unusual importance, for, apart from its bearing on questions of
aviculture, it has thrown new light on the difficult problem
of classification.
II. Pteryeosis.
a. The trunk.
From a reference to the figure in Mrs. Johnstone's paper it
will be apparent that the young bird, at one month old, is still
completely invested in nestling down save only the wings and
tail, where contour feathers have made their appearance. An
examination of the skin however shows that a few feathers have
begun to sprout from the scapular tracts and from the back of the
neck. The rest of the body is clothed in a short black down
sparsely distributed.
It is not easy to exactly define the form of the several
feather tracts in this nestling, and the task of tracing these is
rendered the more difficult in the absence of an adult for
comparison.
But the head, neck, and upper part of the spinal tract can
be clearly made out. The spinal tract however, on the middle of
the back, spreads out so as to extend downwards and ultimately
blend with the femoral tract--a very primitive character.
The ventral tract, which we may reckon for our present
purpose as commencing at the base of the lower jaw, is at first
ill-defined. There is no interramal space as usual. On the
middle of the under surface of the neck it widens considerably,
and then, sending off a branch to the shoulder, is continued
backwards in the form of a broad outer tract, terminating at the
level of the hinder border of the sternum : and a narrow feebly
developed, and ill-defined median tract, which runs backwards
and downwards to meet its fellow of the opposite side in front
of the cloaca.
The crural or leg tract is unusually well-developed. No
down appears on the apteria or spaces between the tracts.

b. The wings.
The wing presents several features of considerable interest.
The first point that strikes one is the great development of the
quill feathers, the body being still invested in down.
The form of the extended wing is peculiar, as may be seen
in the plate fig. 4.
There are 10 primaries and n secondaries. None of these
have not yet completed their growth, the bases of the feathers
being still sheathed after the fashion of growing feathers.
The longest quills are those in the middle of the wing--
the outermost secondaries, and the innermost primaries. So
that the wing when open has-a peculiar oblong form.
The thumb bears a small claw, but there is no claw on the
index digit.
The hand is slightly shorter than the fore-arm.
The major coverts of the upper surface of the wing have
not only made their appearatice, but, it is to be noticed they have
completed their growth. This is a point to which we shall have
to refer later.
No covert feathers have appeared on the under surface
of the wing.
c. The feet.
The first point that catches attention about the feet of
this bird is their great size; and this is rendered the more
conspicuous by reason of the shortness of the " leg " ( tarsometa -
tarsus&apos;). The longest toe--the middle toe--measures ri inches
in length, or about 27 millimetres ; whilst the tarso-metatarsus
measures a little under 07 inch or about 18 millimetres.
The foot in the adult Touracou is semi-zygodactylous; in
the nestling the outer toe can be turned so as to lie at right
angles to the long axis of the middle toe, and is connected there-
with by a web.
The claws are hooked at the tip, and laterally compressed
to a very marked degree.
The planta, or back of the tarso-metatarsus is granulated,
whilst its anterior surface (acrofarsiumj is covered by a series of
transverse scutes, six in number.

of the Touracou {text fig. 1).

borne on the tip of a developing contour feather,
though only the tip of the latter is shown.
III. Structure of the Nestling-down.
The nestling down is represented only by what I have else-
where called pre-penna, that is to say by down feathers which
are immediately succeeded by contour feathers. Pre-plumulae,
or down feathers succeeded later by down feathers, are wanting.
The pre-pennse are of the umbelliform type (text fig. 1 a),
that is to say they have no distinct shaft, but are composed of a
number of rami or barbs arising from a common base. These
rami are relatively short and bear numerous short radii or bar-
bules, which cease some distance from the end of the ramus
(text fig. 1 a).
Under the microscope each radius is seen to be made up
of a series of rounded rods fitting apparent^ one into another
like the sections of a fishing rod (text fig. 1).
In text fig. 1 a the pre-penna is seen in the process of being
borne out by the definitive, or adult feathers (df.). Concerning
the latter I would remark that there are some points which
demand further investigation. It may prove that this apparently
definitive feather is really what is known as a mesoptile or
intermediate stage between the nestling down and the adult
feather.
Here we may mention that the pre-penna of Fraser's
Touracou differs conspicuously from the similar feathers of the
Hoatzin (text fig. 2). In this bird it will be noticed the barbules
or radii are shorter, and more thickly clustered. Microscopically
examined it will be found that, while in the Touracou the radii
are in the form of jointed rods , in the Hoatzin they take the
form of flattened, ribbon like plates produced, at each joint, into
short processes or fila (text fig . 2 f). Moreover the segments are
longer in the Touracou than in the Hoatzin.

Mr. W. P. Pycraft,
IV. Comparison of Fraser's Touracou with the
Cuckoos.
The Touracous are regarded, with almost common con-
sent, by systematists, as more nearly allied to the Cuckoos than
to any other group : and this attitude may be regarded as sound.
It is well therefore that we should briefly compare the
young stages of these two birds.
As we have already pointed out, the young of both groups
have been stated to agree in that they remained naked until the
feathers break their sheaths.
We now know that the young of the Touracous, on the
contrary, are clothed in down during the early stages of life.
The Cuckoos are generally regarded as having young
which do not develop nestling down but remain naked till the
feathers appear. Thus, though at first naked, they soon present
a curiously spiny appearance, recalling that of the hedgehog,
and this is retained till the bursting of the feather sheaths.
We have yet much to learn concerning the Cuckoos, how-
ever. It is certain that the young Touracous represent the more
primitive condition. And it would seem that the Cuckoos have
become highly specialized in this matter, the nestling down,
from some reason not yet understood, having become suppressed.
The young of Ce?itropus--the Lark-heeled Cuckoos--however yet
preserve traces of the nestling down, which appears during
late embryonic life in the form of long slender threads. These, on
hatching, retain this peculiar form until borne out, after the
fashion of nestling down, on the tips of the developing contour
feathers. These hair-like structures are to be regarded as
vestiges of the nestling down feathers which never burst their
investing sheaths.
Whilst the young Cuckoos are completely zygodactylous,
the young Touracou is only partly so.
V. Comparison of the Nestling Touracou with the
Nestling Hoatzin ( Opisthocowms cristatusj.
We may now pass on to compare the young Touracou
with the young of that aberrant and extremely interesting bird
the Hoatzin, Opisthocomus cristatus.

on the Nestling of Fraser&apos;s Touracou. 61
Briefly, the two nestlings superficially bear a very close
resemblance one to another : but this fact must be put down
rather to convergence than to any very close relationship.
Both are alike downy, but whereas the young Touracou is
clothed only in nestling down known as pre-pennse, the young
Hoatzin has, in addition, an extra covering of down feathers--
the pre-plumulse.
Both in the Touracou and the Hoatzin the feet are of
enormous size, but in the latter all the front toes are turned
forward.
It is in the wing that the most striking features occur, both
in the young Touracou and the young Hoatzin. The form of
this organ in the Touracou can be seen in the plate accompany-
ing this paper. The wing at this stage {fig- 4)--one month old--
resembles that of the young Hoatzin (ftgsi-f) of the same age : and
partly on this account and partly on other grounds, I am inclined
to believe that, when we come to know more of the earlier history
of the young Touracou, we shall find a similar series of the
same remarkable phases of development.
These we may briefly outline as follows : At hatching the
wing of the young Hoatzin is remarkable for the great length of
the hand, which is considerably longer than the forearm, and
armed with two strong claws, one on the thumb, the other on the
index finger. The quill feathers are represented only by
rounded brush-like tufts of feathers.
The considerable length of the hand at this stage would
probably never have excited more than passing comment, whilst
the claws would have been regarded as vestiges of a reptilian
stage ; had it not been for the discovery of Mr. C. Quelch, who
in the Ibis of 1890 published a most interesting and remarkable
account of the life-history of this bird.
He showed, beyond cavil, that the young are quite unlike
birds hatched in an arboreal nursery generally, inasmuch as
they leave the nest in a few hours and climb about the tree in
which it is placed. In other words the young are precocious.
In the climbing not only the toes and feet are used, but the wing
also. Hence the great length of the hand, and the size of the
claws (see fig. 1 on the plate.). As development proceeds the

</page>
<bodyText confidence="0.997834615384615" page_id="32656518"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
Mr. W. P. Pycraft,
growth of the quills follows a quite peculiar course. The
primaries at the tip of the wing have their growth arrested until
the inner primaries have increased sufficiently to form a
parachute in the case of a fall. So soon as this stage has been
reached the outermost primaries and the secondaries commence
to grow, and within a very short time the claws become
absorbed, and the growth of the fore-arm overtakes and exceeds
that of the hand. The claws and long hand being of no further
use, in short, become suppressed.
In the young Fowl a similar order of growth is followed,
but since flight, in a brood which has exchanged an arboreal
for a terrestrial nursery, is now imperative at the earliest
possible stage, the innermost primaries grow at an exceedingly
rapid rate, so that flight for short distances is possible within a
few hours after birth. Hence the peculiar form of the wingseen
in the plate fig. 2. The free-finger-tip--though minus the claw
---is here very conspicuous. Save as an adaptation in a precocious
nestling to a sometime arboreal nursery, the free-finger-tip is
inexplicable.
But the young game-birds possess another curious feature.
In them the first flight feathers of the forearm are formed by
the major coverts. Later these are replaced by the secondaries.
Now it may be remembered, I pointed out that while the secon-
daries of the young Touracou were yet partly ensheathed in their
embryonic coverings (page 57) the major coverts had com-
pleted their growth. Fiom this, and the form of the wing
generally, I venture to prophesy that when we get earlier stages
in the development of the Touracou we shall find the same
features are produced which obtain in the young Opisthocomus,
and that the first flight feathers of the forearm will be the major
coverts, which, later, will be found to be replaced by the secon-
daries. I have the more confidence in this since Mrs. Johnstone
has specially remarked, in her most interesting paper, that the
young bird, very early in life, " used to scramble about on its
basket lid." But she does not however, say, whether the wings
were used in this scrambling. Possibly, now that attention is
drawn to the matter she may be able to enlighten us on this
point.

I have elsewhere dealt at length on the curious life-history
of the Hoatzin, and the game-birds, as well as of nestlings
generally, and would refer those of my readers who care to pur-
sue this subject further to these sources of information.
VI. Summary.
Although this nestling seems to have been killed by the
cold nights of September I do not think the growth of the
feathers or nestling down was in any way appreciably retarded
by this factor. Many nestlings retain the down-feathers of the
trunk for a long time after hatching.
Ornithologists should be grateful to Mrs. Johnstone for the
care and enterprise she has shown in procuring and breeding
these birds. She has moreover achieved the greatest triumph
yet attained by aviculturists--horrid word--for, until the
appearance of this nestling the young of the Touracou were
absolutely unknown. It is to be hoped that next year she may
be able to supply us with the missing links required to complete
this history.

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Judging from letters and notes that have appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine , few of our members have kept the various
species of Sandgrouse, and, so far as I know, few have been
lately imported. I do not know that, except Mr. Meade-Waldo
and myself, anyone in this country has bred P. alchatus, the
Greater Pintailed Sandgrouse, and P. exusius, the Lesser Pin-
tailed Sandgrouse, I think has not been recorded hitherto as
rearing young in confinement.
I succeeded with this species this summer, and perhaps a
short account may be thought worthy of record. I have kept a
male and two females for several years, and every summer eggs
have been laid, but nothing resulted, probably because the
females interfered with each other, and generally the eggs were
unfertile.
However, a chick was hatched in 1903, but weakly, and
it did not survive more than a day or two. One year both hens
laid at the same time, and incubated, and it was curious to see
the male bird's predicament. As many of our readers will be
aware, each parent shares in the duty of incubation, the female
by day and the male by night : although sometimes, when the
female is off feeding, the male goes on for a short time during
the day. The poor cock bird, in the case referred to, tried to do
his duty by each clutch of eggs, sometimes sitting in one nest,
and sometimes the other ; and of course the eggs got chilled and
disappointment followed. At that time I was more interested
in some other occupants of the aviary, and the Sandgrouse did
not perhaps get the attention they deserved.
However, this spring I took care that the cock and the
most vigorous-looking hen had the floor of a heated aviary to
themselves; and in due course three eggs were laid, and were
regularly and properly attended by the old birds. I was away
from home when the three chicks emerged, and did not see them
until they were several days old, and feeding nicely upon maw
seed and a mixture of grass and clover seeds. The birds
preferred the former: and here I may say that I have never
found any harm come of a free use of maw seed in the case of

on the Breeding of Pt erodes Exits his. 65
aviary birds. The Bearded Tits especially feed more on this than
on any other seed ; and all kinds of Sandgrouse and Ouail etc.
seem exceedingly fond of it. It seems that there is no stupe-
fying quality in the seed of the poppy ; and I believe the drug,
the name of which is associated with this plant, is obtained by
crushing the seed-capsule, and not at all from the seed within it.
One of the young did not grow so quickly as the others,
aud died when about ten days old ; the others thriving from the
first, and growing apace. Young Sandgrouse are fledged at an
early age, and, being fat and heavy, are apt to seriously bruise
and injure themselves if suddenly startled, unless their flight-
feathers are shortened. The parents (both) brooded the young
in a sunny corner of the aviary, and for the first few weeks they
did not wander far, except to follow the sun-patches as they
shifted across the aviary floor. Though they squatted closely
when anyone approached, they soon began, when all was quiet
again, to pick up the seeds which we sprinkled over and around
them.
I could see no difference in habit of either young or
parents between this species aud alchatus, except that my exustus
have never shown any inclination for shepherd's purse, chick-
weed, lettuce, or grasses, or any other green food: whereas,
alchatus must be supplied with these things if it is to be kept in-
health. This probably points to exustus inhabiting more arid
districts than the other species.*
As in alchatus the cock bird (only) waters the young, so
does the male exustus. Mr. Meade-Waldo was the first to
describe this most interesting habit in the case of the former
species. It has been repeatedly observed in my aviaries, and
now again with exustus.
Whether the habit is common to all the species of this
family remains to be ascertained, though in the case of the fine
arenarius Mr. Meade-Waldo observed this species also visiting
the troughs and puddles about the village wells in Morocco, and
flying off after soaking their breast-plumage, doubtless with the
same object in view. The process is so extraordinary that
perhaps I may be forgiven for again dwelling upon it. The
* Although closely allied, P. exustus differs from P. alchatus in not exhibiting the
remarkable seasonal changes of plumage (in both sexes) seen in the latter species.

Miss D. Hamilton,
young no doubt are somehow able to make it clear to their male
parent that they wish to drink, and he starts off to the pan, and
after sipping a little on his own account, steps in and stands
motionless for a minute or two watching. Then he sits down in
the water, and goes through a shuffling movement very like a
bird that is dusting. After remaining in the water several
minutes, he gets out and hurries off loudly calling to the young,
who if old enough run to meet him. Then follows what reminds
one more than anything of a mammal suckling her young: the
chicks push their heads amongst the breast-plumage and under
tail-coverts, evidently taking the water off the feathers by
passing them through their bills, moving to fresh places as the
supply becomes exhausted.
It is hard to understand how moisture, carried in this way,
can be preserved during a lengthened flight through the arid
atmosphere of the summer season in the countries affected by
these birds : and one feels surprised that some simpler method
has not been evolved, as in the case of the Rook, which carries
food to its mate or young in the baggy pouch between the lower
fauces of the beak.
It is to be regretted that the members of this interesting
family are not more often imported, so that their breeding habits
may be compared. My experience is that if kept dry, Sand-
grouse will live long in captivity, and that they are most peace-
able towards the occupants of their aviary, do not require much
space, and are in many ways desirable birds to study.

(Continued from page 33J.
Hitherto I had looked upon all foreign birds as "tropical,"
and therefore as requiring a kind of hot-house treatment which
I could not have given them. But having read Dr. Greene's
" Birds I have kept," I changed my views, and the first foreign
bird I bought was a Rosella Parrakeet. I was still somewhat
under the delusion that so bright-coloured a bird must require
extra warmth, and every evening I used to fill a stone hot-water
bottle with boiling water, put it in a flannel bag, and stand it on

end against one side of the cage, which I then covered with a
light woollen shawl. At those times, and then only, the Rosella
used to utter piercing shrieks of anger and derision, and I
should not have mentioned the plan, but that I have since found
it a most useful one in treating delicate Gouldians or such birds
as really require warmth on cold winter nights, or even on damp
summer ones when the birds are moulting badly, or when egg-
binding is feared.
Two Rosellas in succession died of fits and apoplexy,
brought on, I believe, by constipation and want of exercise. My
third bird was tame and used to fly about my room, and he ate
apples and mealworms, which I cannot help thinking was
a very helpful change from a diet of dry seed only. He lived
with me for several years, and then I gave him to a great
admirer of his who had done me the service of taking care
of a favourite dog while I was abroad. Last spring I heard
that the bird was as well and as lively as ever, and I trust he is
so still. In my opinion the common Red Rosella is one of the
most beautiful as well as one of the most amiable of Parra-
keets. It very seldom screams or makes any disagreeable noise
whatever.
My next foreign bird was an American Nonpareil--but if
I begin to enlarge upon his beauties and graces and excellences
of all sorts I shall never stop. I consider him a perfect cage
bird. My original one is still living (it is six years or more since
I bought him) though he quickly passed out of my possession
into my mother's. When I went for my annual holiday in
Switzerland I took my Rosella and my Nonpareil with me, as in
their case I could not adopt my old plan of setting free. They
were much admired, but, owing to a multiplicity of cats (there
were 25 cats and kittens in and about the house at the time) I
kept my birds strictly in my own room. One morning I heard
my mother ask my father to smoke in her glass house, as the
plants were covered with green fly. I wanted my father to walk
with me, so I proposed my Nonpareil as his substitute in the
greenhouse. At first my mother was afraid, " Would not the
bird hurt the flowers? Might he not poison himself?" I
thought not; and he was soon flying loose among the plants, and
was pronounced by my mother to be a far more effectual vermin-

Miss D. Hamilton,
killer than tobacco smoke. He did no harm, and added life and
motion to the beauties of the flowers. Day by day he won my
mother's heart more and more till at last, when my holiday was
ended, I had to go back to London without my bird. Now my
mother is a member of the Avicultural Society, and has about
30 birds flying in that greenhouse. I have another Nonpareil
whom I find quite as charming as my first one. But they have
one peculiarity which makes them unsuitable birds for keeping
in one's bedroom. Both my Nonpareils have the habit of
occasionally flying up and down their cage all night. I have
noticed this especially on moonlight nights in spring and
autumn, and I wonder if it corresponds with their times of
migration in their native land. In spring they will sing at
intervals all through the night too.
All the books I have seen very rightly insist upon the
necessity of keeping Nonpareils well supplied with insect food.
As a matter of fact I believe that if this is done in spring and
summer, the bird can get through the winter months quite
comfortably on seed alone. At different times of the year I have
found that my Nonpareils prefer special kinds of insects. I11
early spring they are grateful enough for mealworms (though
they always prefer the pupa to the larva). As summer conies on
the)&apos; - are wild after flies and grasshoppers, and in autumn they
seem to like spiders better than anything else. Greenfly, and
smooth caterpillars are always welcome, and flowering grasses,
green oats, and weeds of almost every sort are much relished at
all times. I never give my birds any bought seeds other than
canary, and white and spray millet. I should think that the
Nonpareils would be very useful in countries where locusts
abound. Mine always catches the grasshoppers I offer him, with
wonderful agility, and devours them eagerly.
My first visit to a Crystal Palace Bird Show made me keen
to possess some of the birds I saw there, especially Gouldian
Finches and Pintail Nonpareils. At last I ventured on a pair of
Goulds, which looked healthy and were in brilliant plumage.
Alas ! they both died in a few days. I thought that must be
through some fault in my management of them, so I asked
advice as to their proper treatment and bought another pair.

One died at once of fits--the other lingered for a few weeks and
then died of "debility," as thin as a shadow. This was most
disheartening, but did not in the least diminish my longing to
keep these brilliant birds. Wandering one day in Covent Garden
I discovered Robert Green's, and to the man in charge there I
confided my wish to possess a pair of Gouldian Finches who
should not die. He said he thought he could satisfy me, and the
pair I got from him are with me now, in excellent health and
great beauty. I bought them in June, 1902. That first winter
the hen began to lay, and several times I thought I should have
lost her. She was very tame, and as soon as I saw her looking
pufty and unhappy I used to take her in my hand and sit with
her on my lap by the fire, or put her on a flannel-covered hot
water bottle in a basket. She always managed to lay her egg,
and then was all right again at once. She never got a chance of
sitting as the cock ate all the eggs. My Goulds are very fond of
green oats, and all sorts of flowering grass, and I always keep
them well supplied. I11 the winter I use lark turfs, lettuce
leaves, or growing canary seed. The hen devours a wonderful
quantity of crushed egg shell, and when she is laying she always
eats mealworms. Even the cock condescends to eat a few when
he is moulting. All my Australian finches are fond of rock-salt.
Just before I bought my first pair of Gouldian Finches, I
had purchased a pair of little Cordon Bleus for 3/6 in Seven
Dials. They were newly imported and rather bare of feathers,
and very shivery at first, but they soon got well and strong. The
cock I have still, but he has lost two wives--the first through an
accident and the second from egg-binding. They are lovely little
birds, but my cock is so fierce I cannot keep him with my cock
Gould or Parrot-finch--he chases them up and down the cage
and pulls their feathers out by the beakful. I have not found
Cordons at all delicate nor given to eating each other's feathers,
though I have kept them with Lavender-finches and other small
birds in a cage in my sitting-room. They always have insect
food of some sort (green fly or small ants they like best of all)
and plenty of flowering grass.
As my Gouldians were thriving, I thought I might risk
buying Pintail Nonpareils, and I secured a gorgeous pair. Next

Miss D. Hamilton,
day I found the cock dead ! He had looked so well, and had
been singing cheerily so it was a great disappointment. I sent
his body for an autopsy, and the answer came, " I fear your bird
succumbed to a prolonged fast." He had been plentifully
supplied with spray millet and canary seed, but apparently he
preferred death to anything but paddy-rice. I got some paddy-
rice for the hen, but she died in three days from fractured skull.
Almost in despair I went again to my friend Robert Green. He
had a pair of acclimatised Pintail Nonpareils who would eat
canary seed or anything. They were very beautiful to look at,
but were wild, and dull, sitting perfectly still by the hour
together unless I went near their cage when they would flutter
wildly. I fed them on paddy-rice, oats, canary seed and spray
millet, and they seemed quite well until after they had moulted,
when the cock died for no reason at all, and the hen got a sort
of cramp or paralysis in her feet. I have not tried Pintail
Nonpareils again, much as I admire their beauty.
My favourite bird is my Parrot-finch--parti} 7 because I had
waited for one so long, but mainly on account of his manifold
merits. When I first saw the one at the Zoo, I quite lost my
heart to him, and I really think nothing but the certainty of being
caught in the act, prevented me from carrying him off, cage and
all (he was in a small cage in the Parrot-liouse then) for I had
searched for a Parrot-fincli all over London in vain. At last,
when I opened my Avicultural Magazine , there actually was a
Parrot-finch for sale. I could hardly believe my eyes ! Not
another word did I read until I had written asking for that bird,
and had posted the letter. Then followed a time of agonized
suspense. Perhaps some other member had received his maga-
zine sooner than I--or one had telegraphed instead of writing.
But no; it was all right for me. Other members had written for
the bird, but my letter arrived first, and he was mine. High as
were my expectations it is putting it mildly to say that he has
exceeded them. His brilliant beauty, his intelligence, tameness,
and hardiness are, I should think, unequalled by any bird of his
size. As soon as I had loosed him from his tiny travelling cage,
he began singing his silvery little song, and he very soon dis-
covered that he had only to fly to the front of his cage and

whistle in order to obtain whatever he wanted. Green oats, sponge
cake, mealworms, hemp seed, lettuce leaves--almost any dainty
in fact, he calls for as soon as ever it comes in sight. Lettuce he
is very fond of, but directly he has had enough he tears up the
rest of the leaf in wanton destruction, holding it under one foot
while he tears it to shreds with his beak. He also uses his beak
for digging the sprouting canary seeds out of the mould or damp
sand in which I grow the canary grass for my birds. I never
knew any bird so fond of his cold bath as the Parrot-fincli is.
As soon as a pan of clean water is put into his cage he plunges
in, splashing vigorously, and soaking himself, again and again,
until there is no water left, and he looks like a little drowned
mouse. I often wonder why birds are so much more particular
about their bath water being clean, than they are about their
drinking water. All through last winter, as soon as it got dark
about 4 p.m., the Parrot-finch used to retire to bed in a cocoanut
shell, which he had carefully lined with dry grass. But about
ten p.111., when the candles were alight, he would pop out of bed,
splash about in his bath once more, and after carefully drjdng
himself, make a hearty supper of spray millet. Sometimes I got
impatient, and then, a sure way of making him hurry back to
bed was to blow out one of the candles. He knew he would not
be able to see his way back without their light, so he would hop
back and settle down in a minute. When let out of his cage he
doesn't fly round and round the room as the Gouldians do, but
takes short flights, and climbs about the chairs and furniture,
enquiring curiously into everything he sees. His favourite
pastime is hunting up and down the plants for greenfly, and
then, I think, he looks his best.
For some mouths I was quite satisfied with my beautiful
birds and wanted nothing more. But at length I was fired with
a strong desire to win the Society's medal, and began hunting
about the bird shops for something rare and inexpensive. One
day Robert Green told me he had what I wanted, and showed me
some chocolate-coloured birds with milk white heads. "Why
these are only common Cigar-birds," I said contemptuously.
But Robert Green pointed out that their throats were black,
while in the common kind they are grayish white like the head,

and moreover he showed me their name, Munia fermiginosa, the
Javan Maja Finch, written for him by Mr. Frank Finn. That
decided me--my chance had come. There were only four birds,
and one appeared to be dying. I took the two healthiest, and
begged for the bodies of the other two if they should die, which
they both did before long, and I have their skins. My two lived,
and were gentle, affectionate birds, but decidedly dull. They
made no attempt at nesting, and this summer one of them died
just as it had finished moulting. It was very ill and weak for a
long time before it died, and its wife, or brother (I don't know
the sex of the surviving bird) took the greatest care of it, sup-
porting it by sitting close beside it, and protecting it from the
other birds. He really is a kind hearted bird, and now he is
nursing a delicate little Bicheno finch, sitting quite still while
she cuddles up to him all day long. He never moves even to eat
unless she goes first. So I have forgiven him for not earning the
medal, and really feel quite fond of him in spite of his dulness.
I have neverseen the Javan Maja Finches eat anything butspray
millet.
Another bird I am very proud of is my Himalayan Black-
crested Bunting, the survivor of two I bought as a pair, again
with a view to the Society's medal. I saw these birds looking
very miserable in a cage with some Brown-headed Buntings and
Saffron Finches, who were pulling out the poor Black Bunting's
feathers, and sucking the moist ends of them. Although warned
not to do so, as the birds were newly imported and far from well,
I bought them and took them home with me. One was glossy
black all over, excepting his tail and the flight feathers of his
wings, which were bright cinnamon brown. The other (which I
then thought was the hen, but have since discovered to be a
young male) had tawny margins to all its body feathers, giving it
a dull brownish look. The flights and tail were cinnamon as in
the larger bird. Both birds devoured mealworms voraciously,
but the older one was quite incapable of digesting anything it
ate, and it died in three days. The younger one soon got better
and began to sing. It moulted, but the feathers came back
with brown margins as before. This summer it has certainly
been getting blacker without moulting again. I think the

feathers are changing from brown to black, as the lemon-
coloured feathers on my Nonpareil's breast changed to brighter
and brighter scarlet as the spring warmed into summer. My
Crested Bunting is a handsome, sprightly, tame fellow, quite
harmless with the other birds, and possessed of a beautiful song.
I hope one day to find a mate for him, and to win that medal
at last.

The following notes were made two summers ago during
a short stay on Mahd, the largest island of the Seychelles group.
As one would expect from their isolated position, these lovely
islands possess a flora and a fauna of considerable interest. In-
digenous mammals there are none, though one colonist, the
brown rat, is now only too much at home.
Birds are numerous, and there are sixteen species peculiar
to these islands.
Mali6 is about the size of the Isle of Wight. It is very
mountainous, most of the hills being covered from the summit
to the water's edge with luxuriant vegetation.
A common and striking bird is a small pure white Tern
( Gygis Candida). The Terns are not confined to the sea shore,
but spend much of their time inland, hawking about the trees,
presumably after insects. They breed in a clove forest, close
to the bungalow where we were staying, and always roost in the
trees. It is said that they lay a single egg on a bare, horizontal
branch, fixing it thereto with a sticky secretion, and that in that
position the egg is incubated. Very graceful and beautiful these
birds look flitting about the dark clove trees, which much re-
semble our evergreen oaks.
The Tropic Bird (,Phcethon caudata) is another sea bird
which nests inland (I believe in hollows of dead trees). It is
white, with the exception of the two centre tail feathers which
are fully a yard long and pale yellow in colour. Hence its Creole
name " Paille en queued

(.Fregata aquila ) soared for some time above us without a move-
ment of their huge wings.
The Seychelles Bulbul ( Hypsipetes crassirostris ) is a hand-
some and most amusing bird. It is fully as large as a Missel
Thrush. The plumage is of russet brown and black--the up-
standing crest black and the thick beak yellow. The bird has a
decidedly Jay-like appearance and manner.
The Bulbuls are always seen in pairs, and they are
curiously tame and inquisitive. A pair of the birds often fol-
lowed us in the woods for some time, coming almost within
reach to examine us and scolding from time to time in discordant
voices, quite unlike that of the Bulbul of tradition. They would,
I should think, take quite kindly to captivity.
Mynahs (Acridotheres tristis) are very numerous, and come
every evening from far and near to roost in the clove forest. As
they were settling down for the night the clatter that they made
was almost deafening. These birds have been introduced.
A gorgeous Fruit Pigeon ( Alectroenas pulcherrimus) had
some years ago become almost exterminated. Now, on my
brother's estate, where they are protected from Creole and black
sportsmen, they are quite numerous, several roosting every
night on some tall trees just beside the house. The Fruit
Pigeons are very strong flyers, and go through curious evolutions
in the air, soaring and then dropping down great distances with
closed wings.
Two species of Zosterops ( modesta and semifiavd) are
common and charming little birds, while a fairy-like little
Sunbird would visit each flower in the verandah without in the
least minding our presence.
The onty representatives of the Parrot tribe which I saw
were Madagascar Lovebirds (Agapornis cand), and these have
been introduced. There is, however, a Black Parrot ( Coracopsis
barklyi), as well as a Green Parrakeet ( Palaeornis wardi) found in
some of the islands.
Mahd abounds in exotic plants, which, after being intro-
duced, have spread throughout the island ; several species of
birds have done the same. The following is told of the intro-
duction of the Madagascar Weaver ( Foudia madagascariensis .)

Two neighbours went to law concerning the ownership of a rice
field. The loser, vowing vengeance, procured a cageful of
Weavers from Madagascar. Since then it has been impossible
to grow rice at a profit in the Seychelles.
At my brother's bungalow, these Weavers and the Zebra
Doves (Geopelia striata ) which abound on the estate, come every
afternoon to be fed with rice. Anyone holding out a handful of
rice at the feeding place will at once have his hand and arm
covered with fluttering, fighting little scarlet Weavers. The
Doves are just as charming in their way, and more peaceable.
They are ridiculously tame for " wild " birds, and when we were
sitting in the verandah they would often perch on our shoulders
or walk over our books. This is certainly an ideal way to
keep and enjoy birds.
Occasionally we saw a small Hawk, much like our Kestrel,
and at night Owls sometimes flew round the house. Of these
Owls the negroes have a superstitious horror. They believe that
they are inhabited by evil spirits, and for fear of them they can-
not be persuaded to enter the forest at night, or to sleep in a
house from which Owls can be heard.
A high price has been set upon this Owl's head by Euro-
pean collectors, but as it keeps almost entirely to the dense
virgin forest, specimens are seldom procured.
THE NESTING OF THE YELLOW SPARROW.
Passer luteus.
By Mrs. Howard Williams.
Sometime in July of last year while on a bird hunting
expedition in the East of London, I discovered some birds, then
quite new to me, with bright yellow heads and bodies and brown
Sparrow-like wings and tail. The dealer told me they were
Yellow Sparrows, and added that he had one hen, to be dis-
tinguished by a light-coloured beak only.
I carried home a supposed pair which were placed in an
aviary in the conservatory, where many young have been hatched
out, and sat down to wait events.
They proved exceedingly nervous birds, retreated to the

topmost perch in the gable roof, and were rarely seen at all.
They took no interest in food, were chased by other birds if they
ventured to descend in search of a seed or a drink, and led a
wretched life to all appearance. After some time I happened to
get a better view of them than usual, and discovered to my
dismay that both bills were light ! This led to inquiry when I
found that both birds were cocks. One of them became subject
to fits, caused by fright I fancied, and they were caught and
placed in a cage in a sitting room. There they spent a quiet
winter, in perfect health, though the dimmer light spoiled their
colour to some extent.
In the early summer they were turned into a new garden
aviary, and two hens were procured at different times, and were
welcomed with great pleasure, shown by drooping wings, fan-
like tail, and much loud chirping. The hens were pale fawn and
brown, with no bright yellow about them at all. One of them,
however, mysteriously disappeared shortly afterwards.
In July the remaining pair began to take an interest in
mealworms and soft food, and began to carry twigs from a dead
Christmas tree into the inner house, and pile them in an untidy
heap in a box hanging on the wall. There seemed to be no nest,
only an untidy heap of fir twigs, as far as could be seen, and I
dared not look closely.
Just then I left home, but on my return in the second week
in September I was told there were young birds in the aviary.
Going to make an inspection I soon discovered two charming
birds dressed neatly in pale fawn with light bills and bright dark
eyes sitting together on a branch. I watched quietly and soon
saw the old birds feed them, which finally established their
identity, for they were not at all like the cock, though they did
resemble their mother to some extent.
When I ventured to examine the nest I found that the
twigs hid the real entrance to it, and that it was made of dried
grass and weeds mixed with many feathers, some ordinary ones
which had been taken from the poultry run and placed in the
aviary, but a good many tiny green ones from a pair ofTavender-
headed Lovebirds which have shared the same quarters all the
summer.

Among the littoral birds of the Clyde estuary there are
few species more familiar to the local observer than the Common
Heron (Ardea cinerea, Linn.). In my locality there is one or more
of these birds, usually immature specimens, to be seen on the
beach at low tide almost every day in the year, either standing
perfectly motionless in the shallow water at the mouth of a burn,
or strutting about among the wet seaweed in search of small
crustaceans. They also resort to a small fresh-water loch among
the hills a few miles distant, where I have sometimes counted ten
or a dozen birds posted among the reeds at its margin ; and at
the edge of a small wood close by two Herons' nests in fir trees
were regularly occupied for many years in succession.
There is no lack of heronries in our western counties, nor
indeed in most districts of Scotland, and in estimating the
number of them, our ornithological authorities have generally
been below the mark. Mr. J. E. Harting, for instance, in the
Zoologist many years ago, put the number of heronries in the
whole of Britain at two hundred, and Professor Newton in his
Dictionary of Birds (1893-6) allowed "above fifty" to be
Scotland's proportion. Recent and accurate investigations
however shew that Scottish heronries are really far more
numerous, and at least two hundred nesting localities in Scotland
alone have been recorded.
In this district the Heron shows a preference for the
Scotch fir as a nesting place ; larch, spruce, and beech are also
used, and in the north of Bute, nests were found some years ago,
on the tops of thick hawthorns. The eggs, it may be mentioned,
are sometimes laid so early as the first week of March. Our

largest heronries at present are :--At Rosneatli, Dumbarton-
shire, about 35 nests in Scotch firs ; at Eglinton Castle, Ayr, 30
nests in Scotch firs and beeches ; at Kelburn Park, Ayr,
25 nests in beeches ; at Inverary, Argyllshire, about 20 nests
in spruce, Scotch firs, and beeches ; at Mount Stuart, Rothesay,
18 nests in Scotch firs and beeches. North of the Mull of
Kintyre there is a wide expanse of bleak moorland, 50 or 60
square miles in extent, where the Heron, adapting itself to
circumstances, has been found to nest 011 ledges of rock and
on the ground. There the late Mr. Gray on two occasions saw
100 to 150 of these birds standing close together on a hillside
above a fresh-water loch, all the time keeping up an incessant
harsh gabble which could be heard a mile away.
During my walks along the shore I occasionally find the
eggs of the Ringed Plover (SEgialitis hiaticola, Einu.) so early in
the season as the first week in April, and so late as the end of
June ; this surely points to the fact of there being at least two
broods in the season. The eggs of the Oyster-catcher ( Hcemato -
p 7 is ostraleg 7 is, Linn.) are also of frequent occurrence among the
rough gravel, shells, etc., at the highest tide-marks. I some-
times come upon the nest of the Common Gull ( Lci 7 r 7 is can 7 is,
Linn.), usually a large well-made structure, and those of the
Common and Arctic Terns ( Steri 7 a flitviatilis and A. macmra,
Naum.). Jackdaws are daily to be seen on the shore ; thej&apos; nest
in adjacent low cliffs. Watertou might well marvel at the
stupidity sometimes evinced by these birds during nidification.
I have more than once watched one of these astute members, of
the corvine race endeavouring to thrust a stick broadside-ou
into the narrow cleft selected as a breeding-place, and after a
while, unable to accomplish its object, drop the stick and go in
search of another.
Magpies (Pica rustica, Scop.) have of late years become
very abundant in an almost treeless locality, not many miles from
here, and close to a large town ; in autumn they are frequently
observed in flocks of seven or eight. I only once found a nest of
this species in the neighbourhood referred to, it was placed in a
straggling sloe hedge ( K Pr 7 aius spii 70 sa ), the only one of the kind I
know of in that countryside. I may mention that in another

district I recently observed a pair of Starlings in possession of a
deserted Magpie's nest in a Scotch elm--an unusual nesting-
place for the Starling.
In this county of Ayrshire the Starling ( Stumius vulgaris ,
Linn.) is probably the commonest bird we have at present, yet
in the Statistical Accozmt of Scotlaiid published in 1837 one is
astonished to read that in Ayrshire " the Starling is a rare bird,
but not altogether unknown " ; and in a list ol rare visitors
known to have occurred in a local parish, its name appears along
with those of the Quail, Roller, and Turtle Dove. It seems to have
been about this time that the Starling first became a resident
species in Ayrshire, and its subsequent enormous increase is pro-
bably chiefly owing to the better draining of the land (tile-
draining was first introduced at this period), and the consequent
wealth of insect life, particularly larval forms such as Tipula
oleracea and various species of Agrotides, etc., in the soil ; for
insects do not abound in a cold, sour, damp medium, and
Starlings instinctively shun such lauds. Then the widening of
the area of pasturage must also be taken into account, and above
all the natural fecundity of the Starling in suitable districts. I
think it is Mr. Dixon who confesses to have taken no less than
forty eggs from one pair during a single season.
I have lately had a good opportunity of substantiating by
personal experience the assertions of ornithologists regarding
the imitative powers of the Starling in its wild state. A bird of
this species, perched upon the ridge-pole of a cottage near the
shore, saluted me one day with the crow of a domestic cock, then
followed the wild piping note of the Redshank ( Totanus calidris,
Linn.), a common bird about the coast, and the harsh cries of the
Gulls which nightly assemble on our rocks, and whose noise
reminds one of what old Gilbert White says of the Peacock's cry,
that " the yelling of cats and the braying of an ass is not more
disgustful " ; the alarm-note of the Blackbird was also excellently
imitated.
I do not remember ever having witnessed the Starlings
Swallow-like habit of catching winged insects in mid-air, but
during sultry July weather I have seen numbers of Black-
headed Gulls ( Larus ridib 7 t?idtis, Linn.) engaged in this

occupation for an hour at a time, in an inland locality. These
little Gulls nest in vast numbers on the sheep-moors in the north
of this county.
Rooks (Corvus frugilegus, Linn.) are casual visitors to the
seashore in winter. By watching near a rookery I have
sufficiently verified the remark that these birds never by any
chance descend to pick up a twig that may have fallen to the
ground, and seldom allow one pair to build their nest at any
great distance from the main body. An attempt was made here
some years ago to establish a new rookery by placing Rooks'
eggs in the nests of the Jackdaws which inhabited a ruinous
building in the vicinity of a group of fair-sized beeches ; but the
young Rooks did not return to the spot. A couple of Rooks'
eggs were also placed in a Missel Thrush's nest close by, and
were hatched, and the young carefully reared b} r the foster-
parents.

BREEDING RESUETS DURING THE PAST SUMMER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999501263157895" page_id="32656536"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
Sir, --We have had, for Scotland, a very fine summer, and an excep-
tionally fine autumn. I turned out my birds, to the number of about fifty,
into my garden aviary in April. The aviary is about 35 feet long, 8 feet
wide, and 8 feet high. There is a fine thick old ivy against the house, and
some bushes, and a thoroughly waterproof tool shed which many of the
birds took advantage of during the rainy weather.
There were three pairs of Zebra finches, and the} 7 started nesting at
once in the tool house, which was fitted with boxes, cocoa-nut husks etc.
I never disturbed the birds, but fear that I had too many birds in, as
the Zebras insisted on laying batches of eggs, then covering them up with
another layer of nesting material and laying a fresh batch on the top. One
of the pairs died in July, but between April and October 9th, when I cleared
out the tool shed, I have taken away between 120 and 130 Zebra Finches'
eggs ! Only one young bird was reared, and I never saw her until she was
nearly fully fledged.
A pair of Budgerigars nested in one of the cocoa-nut husks, rearing
five out of seven. When the birds were three parts grown the hen bird laid
four eggs among them in the same nest, and reared one young bird only.
This bird was still in the same nest when she laid seven more eggs, and one

was hatched. Another pair is nesting in a hnsk in the open, and I think
there are young birds, but it is high up and I have not examined it.
I had four Bengalese also in the aviary, three cocks and one hen.
They nested, and the hen laid four eggs. The four old birds always
crowded together into the nest at night, but the hen succeeded in hatching
and rearing all the youngsters.
A pair of Cutthroats nested, and deserted within a few days of
hatching. That was through my fault in examining the nest. They had
been sitting so long that I thought nothing would come of it.
I had a yellow hen Canary and some Green Singing-finches in the
aviary. The Canary mated with a Green Singing-finch, and built a
beautiful little nest in the ivy. She failed to hatch her first clutch of four
eggs, then nested again and hatched four youngsters ; but a few mornings
afterwards I found the nest pulled to pieces and the young dead. Of
course I suspected a pair of Red-crested Cardinals, and caged them, but the
destruction of a Cordon Bleus' nest and two nests of Green Singing-finches'
subsequently, makes me think that I had accused the Cardinals unjustly.
As usual, I made a mistake in having too many birds in the small space at
my disposal.
In the house I had an ordinary Crystal Palace cage with about a
dozen foreign birds, among them a favourite pair of Cordon Bleus. They
nested and sat most faithfully on three eggs, but the eggs were unfertile.
A widow Bibfinch also laid eggs, but naturally did not hatch.
I am now off to India, so am getting rid of many of my birds, though
I have happily found homes for many of my favourites.
I was very anxious to get a mate for my lonely cock Gouldian, a bird
I brought from India two years ago, but the three hens I got at different
times all died within a few months. They seemed fit and well until within
a couple of days of their death, and then died straight off. The cock has
moulted frequently, and is as bright in feather as when I bought him.
Among the more delicate birds I had outside were a pair of Pintailed
Nonpareils, a Pectoral Finch, St. Helena Waxbills, and Cordon Bleus. All
were perfectly well and lively outside, though I lost one of the Cordons
quite unexpectedly.
Altogether, considering the fact that our climate is so uncertain, and
the aviary is in the town and constantly visited by prowling cats and owls,
the casualties have been very few. But should I ever be home again, I
would assuredly have a heated room to winter the foreigners in.

PADDY RICE.
Sir, --Lately I came across a paper in which the writer advocated
giving paddy rice to his Pintail Nonpareils. If any of our members keep
these birds and feed them as above, do they keep in good health ?

Why I write is that, some years ago several of these birds were in my
possession. They&apos; were kept in a large cage, with Waxbills and the smallest
finches. Their principal food was Canary and the ordinary table rice, and
they kept in very&apos; good health. I had been try ing for more than a twelve-
month to get paddy&apos; rice, and at last received a consignment.
A well-known bird dealer, now deceased, cautioned me not to give
paddy rice, but get the birds on to canary&apos;, as they were liable to get rice
ophthalmia. I did not take his advice, I am sorry to say&apos;, and the conse-
quence was that very soon all the Erythrura prasina contracted this
horrible disease, and had a spongy&apos; sort of growth below the eyes, which
rapidly spread round the mandibles. As after a time they&apos; could only peck
seed with difficulty 7 , I killed the whole of them.
I may add that none of the other birds were affected.

<bodyText confidence="0.99900192" page_id="32656538"  page_num="82" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I think there can be no doubt that the Council were within
their legal rights in enacting the new rules. The original rules, as you
point out, made the Council the sole rule-making authority, and so long as
this power is not exercised in a manner entirely&apos; contrary&apos; to the original
purpose of the Society, the members have no right of veto. But a thing
may be legal without being expedient, and I agree with Mr. Simpson that
the sweeping changes recently introduced should have been submitted to
the members before they were definitely&apos; carried out.
Why it should be " practically&apos; impossible to take a vote of the
Society&apos; as a body unless at a general meeting," I fail to comprehend. Such
a vote was taken before the subscription was raised from 5/- to 7/6.*
It was always customary to publish the names of the proposer and
seconder of each candidate for the Council. The proposer and seconder
were almost invariably well - known members, and their names were
sufficient guarantee of the suitability of the candidate proposed. If your
contention is correct that the Council and the Council alone is competent
to select candidates, surely the right course would be to abolish popular
election entirely 7 , and let the Council 011 all occasions itself fill up the
vacancies in its own body. And if the members are not fit to be trusted
with the management of the Society's affairs, why have a Society at all ?
Surely it would be better to run the Magazine by a syndicate, and turn the
so-called members into mere subscribers.
I am glad to see that the " number of members" who left the Society
to join the F. B. C. has now come down to "several members." I believe

there were actually either one or two, though it is just possible there may
have been as many as three. I11 the second issue of Bird Notes I wrote
"the Club has no desire or intention of competing with the Avicnltural
Society, or of drawing members from it. By all means let everyone belong
to both Club and Society if they will." Those words were published just
three years ago, and to that attitude the F. B. C. has consistently adhered.
The Club has constantly striven to maintain friendly relations with the
Avicultnral Society, and will, I firmly believe, continue to do so in spite
of " pin-pricks." Horatio Fiegmer.
THE NESTING HABITS OF BRUSH TURKEYS.
Sir,---I t must be very annoying to Mr. St. Ouintin to attain a certain
amount of success, only to be disappointed at the last moment, and if he
had observed the excitability which is usually displayed by the cock when
a chick is about to be, or has hatched, and then examined the mound, I
think he would have reared the youngster easily.
My intention is not to supply dry leaves only next season, but to well
intermix these with fresh lawn mowings, which are far too heating if used
alone. By this means I hope to obtain warmth and lightness combined.
It is rather a pity that Mr. Re Souef--who must be well-acquainted
with the nesting habits of this bird -- does not give us some information as
to the material used by the Brush Turkeys in the Melbourne Zoo.; but as
the last remark in his letter savours of more to come, he may yet help us
in our trouble. The great necessity is to find materials which will give a
lasting heat at the bottom of the mound, as it is only the debris above
which is removed and replaced by the birds; and, as we all know, heat
always ascends, consequently the eggs have to depend on that which is
generated at the sides of the heap.
The young ones hatched at Regent&apos;s Park are now full grown and in
perfect health, and as these bring our total up to six birds, I hope to have
at least two mounds going next year.

Sir, --Perhaps it may interest some of your readers to know that
Birds can be resuscitated after drowning much in the same way as human
beings.
A short time ago one of my Ruffs was frightened by something, aud
fell into a deep ditch, and was only recovered after it appeal ed to all intents
and purposes quite dead, floating with its head under water. The bird was
immediately taken into the kitchen, placed in hot flannels, and its wings
moved up and down with a gentle pressure on each side of its breast,
accompanying the movements. After some time (more than ten minutes)
a slight fluttering of the eyelids was noticed, and in about a quarter of an
hour afterwards the bird began to stagger on its legs, and in a short time
was quite recovered.
Maybe other of your members may be induced to try the same
experiment under similar circumstances. Farmers might also try resusci-
tation when cattle and sheep are taken out of dykes or ditches apparently
dead.

A CRID 0 THE RES 31 A HR A TTENS 1 S.
Sir, -- I have received a letter from a Mr. Hargreaves, who however
appears to be at present not one of our members, asking me to identify for
him a Mynah which has been offered to him under the dealer's name of
a "Fuscus" Starling.
Mr. Hargreaves describes the bird fairly minutely, states that it is
about the size of a Blackbird aud has a pearl or grey iris.
In the Museum Catalogue A. mahrattensis is said to measure ten
inches (the size of a Blackbird), but A. fuscus which has the iris yellow only
seven and three-fifths inches: on the other hand Dl\ Jerdon described the
Southern form of the Brown Mynah as a trifle smaller than the type.
It would therefore seem probable that both large and small races
exist with the iris grey and these should be recognized by ornithologists.

positive of its being a Linnet's, owing to its being a rough and very uu-
Chaffinch-like structure.
I abstracted two of the newly - hatched babies and popped them
under a sitting Canary whose eggs were addled. She started feeding the
fosterlings almost immediately on a little soft food which had been pre-
pared for young pheasants, and consisted of old doe rabbits boiled up and
mixed with a little meal, hard-boiled egg, etc.
Upon visiting Kent again, about three weeks later, to fetch my
Linnets, I was astonished to find a fine young Chaffinch hopping about the
cage and clamouring to be fed. The other youngster had tumbled out of
the nest when about a week old and was dead.
The survivor was soon able to cater for itself, and w 7 as allowed its
liberty, which it seemed very loathe to accept.

Leptoptila jamaicensis.
As it is a long time since a coloured illustration of any
species of dove appeared in our Magazine, it is to be hoped that
the plate which is issued with the present number will be
appreciated by our members, as it represents one of the most
beautiful and desirable of those species which can appropriately be
termed ground-doves. Miss Alderson has already given us a
very full and most interesting account of the nesting of this
species in her aviaries in 1903, and Mr. Castle Sloane also bred
it the same year.
The White-fronted Ground-Dove inhabits Jamaica, where
it is known to the inhabitants by the inelegant name of " White-
belly." It is a fairly common species, though it has probably
suffered considerably from the ravages of the Mongoose, which
lias proved so very destructive to all but the purely arboreal
birds.
Gosse gives a good account of this Dove in its wild state
as it existed in the forties, which I cannot do better than quote
at some length ; he writes * : " This lovely Pigeon is chiefly
confined to the upland districts, where its loud and plaintive
cooing makes the woods resound. The negroes delight to ascribe
imaginary words to the voices of birds, and indeed for the
cooings of many of the pigeons, this requires a great stretch of
imagination. The beautiful Whitebelly complains all day, in
the sunshine as well as the storm, ' Rain-come-wet-me-through ! '

each syllable littered with a sobbing separateness, and the last
prolonged with such a melancholy fall, as if the poor bird were
in the extremity of suffering. But it is the note of health, of joy,
of love; the utterance of exuberant animal happiness ; a
portion of that universal song wherewith 'everything that hath
breath may praise the Dord.' The plumage, as usual in this
family, is very soft and smooth, the expression of the countenance
most engagingly meek and gentle. .....
" This is one of those species which habitually live on the
ground : in unfrequented woods, as well those which are open
as those which are choked with underwood, the Whitebelly
walks about singly or in pairs, picking up various seeds. About
Content, a densely wooded mountain side, it is very numerous in
June and July, feeding on sop-seeds, and many are taken in
springes. The physic-nut forms a large portion of its food, as
well as orange-pips ; and fragments of the large seeds of the
mango, chewed by hogs.
" As it walks to and fro, it frequently flirts the head and
tail, but not so markedly as the Pea-Dove.* If flushed it betakes
itself to a low tree not far off, whence, if unmolested, it is soon
down again. Often when seen in the woods it runs a few yards,
and then rises to fly, but as if trusting less to its powers of
flight than to those of running, alights again immediately, and
runs swiftly off among the bushes.
" The aspect and air of the Whitebelly are unlike those of
its kindred. Its round head, the prevalence of light hues, and
its height upon the legs, contribute to this peculiarity.
Essentially a Ground-Pigeon, its length of tarsus enables it to
run with ease and celerity; perhaps more rapidly than any other
of the family.
" Unlike the Tree-Doves, the Whitebelly usually builds
in rather a low situation; often a logwood, a favourite
tree with this, and the Wliitewing.f If in the large woods,
one of moderate height is chosen. The nest consists of
a few loose sticks, with some leaves in the centre ; the eggs
are white."

On Nesting of the Orange Bishop. 89
In the year 1901, our member Mr. Eaton Parker imported
a few of these doves, together with examples of most of the other
Jamaican species, and I obtained four living specimens from
him. These turned out to be three males and one female. One
of the males died, I gave another to the Zoological Gardens,
where the species had been unrepresented since the year 1873,
and kept the pair. These made several attempts to nest during
the following summer, but, presumably through being disturbed
by other birds, failed to sit properly. I11 the early spring of
1903 the hen unfortunately died : so that I have not had the
good fortune to rear a single young bird of this beautiful species.
I would strongly advise our members to re-read Miss
Alderson's article (Vol. I., N. S. p. 393, Vol. II., N.S. p. 28) while
studying the charming plate which Mr. Goodcliild has drawn
from the living specimen at the Zoological Gardens, and which
represents the male bird in the act of cooing. D. S.-S.

Pyromelana franciscana.
By Reginald Phieeipps.
I am not acquainted with any previous instance of this
species having laid eggs in the United Kingdom ; perhaps,
therefore, the following case should be placed on record.
On October 31st last I noticed a pair of these birds making
love, on November 5th I found the completed nest, the first egg
was laid on the 8th, a second on the 9th, the female commencing
to sit towards the afternoon of the 10th. It is possible that a
third egg had been laid that day and had perhaps been dropped
owing to the thick morning fog, or it may have been stolen from
the nest before I paid my visit. The weather distinguished itself
by being wet, cold, frosty, clammy, foggy, dank, dark, everything
that was disagreeable and undesirable for a tropical bird in an
exceptionally airy nest--but the plucky little female sat through
it all.
The nest was built at the end of the garden, in a stack of
dead boughs, and was not much concealed. During the winter

Mr. Reginald Phieeipps,
the whole garden is thrown open to the birds in the birdroom, so
the Bishops had to defend their eggs from an army of idle
knaves who, with one interesting exception, having nothing in
hand themselves, thought it fine fun to attempt to raid the nest.
Who built the nest I do not know ; I have never seen the
male with nesting material in his beak, but have occasionally
noticed the female carrying hay ; probably they both worked
together, the one inside the other out. The female alone sat on
the eggs; I doubt if the male ever once entered the nest.
All through the day the male watched over the sitting bird,
at first from a high branch several yards away, but later at the
nest itself, madly flapping his wings and loudly chirping in vain
endeavours to frighten away his numerous foes, and many a
good fight he fought in defence of hearth and home ; it was
uphill work however, and probably he would have been killed
on more than one occasion had I not rushed to the rescue, for,
after all, he was but a poor fighter. Towards evening he would
go to roost in a thick privet clump opposite the nest; but when I
came round to drive the birds into the birdroom for the night he
would accompany them, and never offered to return to the garden.
The female at first but not afterwards, from habit, would also go
into the birdroom along with the crowd, but recollecting herself
would quickly return to the nest, and was thus left all alone
throughout the long miserable November nights--alone with
the cats and the (shut up) Burrowing Owls. For a few evenings
she keenly felt her lonely position and would return to the bird-
room ; but her maternal instincts would quickly re-assert them-
selves and she would hurry back to her post.
On the 13th, it had been bitterly cold and foggy during the
morning and preceding night, and another frosty night was
coming on. All the birds had been put to bed some time before
when I noticed the female Bishop pleading for re-admission to
the birdroom. It was so late I concluded she had really given in
at last, so, letting her in but not quite closing the window, I
proceeded to the nest for the purpose of saving the eggs and
taking measurements, as the birds could come out at daybreak,
and damage might be done in the morning before I came down.
Without injuring the nest, I examined it so far as the dim light

would permit and then, seeing no sign nor prospect of the return
of the Bishop, went to the house for a tea spoon with which to
take out the eggs, but, when about to insert it, found her once
more in possession. She had threaded her way in comparative
darkness from the lighted birdroom through the open chink in
the window, along the side of a part of the house which the next
house had thrown into deep shade, just over the heads of the
glaring and excited Owls now very much awake, through the
opening in the division between the two aviaries which was
partially blocked with a tangle of golden-elder boughs, round
two sides or possibly diagonally across the over-grown inner
aviary, and had safely regained the nest in the gloomy wood-
pile in about the darkest corner of the whole place.
The devotion to duty of these two birds was worthy of
greater consideration at my hands than I extended to them. I
had the other birds to think of, some valuable and many highly
valued, and was unwilling to deprive them, with the long winter
coming on, of the substantial benefits to be derived from the
free use of the entire garden ; moreover, I was shy of confining
the Bishops to the inner aviary, for, oddly enough, although
there was an abundance of food near to the nest, I had noticed
that it was the custom of the female to fly right away to the bird-
room to feed, probably with the added purpose of getting a good
warm. Somebody besides myself seems to have noticed this
little peculiarity on the part of the female, and to have made
arrangements accordingly. During the absence of the female,
why did not her mate cover the eggs instead of standing outside
flapping his wings and trying to look big? Just about this time
another pair of birds were hatching out young in the birdroom
and had not even been detected, but then they were running
their business on the quiet in a secluded corner, not on the cock-
a-doodle-do system in the most frequented resort in the whole
garden. His brilliant uniform and military swagger impressed
the other birds with respect for a time--but at least one had
taken his measure. I suppose we must not be too hard on him
though. His gaudy plumage attracts the eye at such a distance
that for him to enter such a gossamer nest would be to betray its
position, in this case already only too well known, and instinct

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
or denseness or whatever you may like to call it held him back.
What is bred in the bone will come out in the flesh, and, like the
typical Britisher, having been accustomed to one way of doing a
thing, rather than do it in any other he would prefer to--to live
on some other person's scanty earnings. Thus in identical
circumstances some succeed, and others fail because they will
not take the trouble to adapt themselves to their altered
Surroundings.
On the 17th the two eggs w T ere safe. O11 the following
morning, at S.40, I found the bird on the nest with her head
under her wing, a sight I had never previously beheld with any
sitting bird of any species that I can remember. After break-
fast I closely watched her. Her breathing was rather laboured
but she seemed bright and cheerful, and was most unwilling to
come off the nest, so I left her undisturbed. During the morning
I was busy near her, and for a moment she came out; she
seemed fairly well, and on seeing who it was promptly hopped
back again. The eggs must have been safe at that time ; but
when I returned about 4 p.m. both had disappeared and the old
birds too.
The afternoon had been foggy and dark ; and lamps, and
my old friends the Bee-eaters, figured April, 1902, who cannot
see to feed themselves in a bad light, had fully occupied my
attention. In truth I had on one occasion sallied out and driven
away the male Black-headed Sibia, figured June, 1903, who had
taken up a watchful position close to the nest, like a cat watching
a mouse-hole, in spite of the energetic remonstrances of the
Bishop. Doubtless it was this bird who secured the coveted
eggs (alas for me, for I also coveted them) ; but whether it was
that the female, owing to indisposition, had deserted the nest,
or had only gone away to feed and warm herself, I do not know.
Probably it was the latter; and one feels that the male, if he had
not the gumption to sit on the eggs, might have kept the thief at
bay until the female returned, as 011 former occasions; but a
male Sibia is slim, bold, purposeful, and strong, and exception-
ally daring and quick in his movements.
The nest, built solely of hay, 3ft. Sin. above the ground, was
so open in construction that one could see through it in any part.

It was of the shape of an orange, which was characteristic, with
a slice cut straight down off the front representing the aperture,
which was as perpendicular as a house window, without entrance
lobby, retort, or shelter of any kind whatever, circular, almost
exactly two inches in diameter, and high up in the side of the
nest. In a short time the lower part became slightly pressed
down, with a corresponding drawing in of the sides, so that it
(the aperture) became higher than it was broad. The nest proper
was just about 401. high, 3^in. broad, and 2fiu. from front to
back, the inside cup being a trifle over i^in. deep, so that the
sitting bird could be seen at some distance. At first she would
"lie low," but soon becoming used to me would look out at me
without any attempt at concealment. The nest was perfectly soft
inside, being lined with the finest material, but externally it had
the appearance of a chance lump of hay. It was moderately
firmly attached to the sticks about it but particularly at the
bottom, and, although so fragile to view, was nearly as strongly
woven together as a piece of lace, the nest coming away intact
leaving no trace behind. If it had not been erected on a good
foundation, but instead had been suspended amongst growing
stalks or the like, it is probable that the weight of the bird would
have dragged it down to the purse-sliape mentioned by some
writers. As it was, there was nothing about it to suggest that it
is the custom of the species to suspend its nest after the manner
of the Reed Warbler.
The eggs could be seen, 011 a clear day plainly, through the
large aperture, and I saw them nearly every day. When fresh
they appeared to be of a light-blue colour, probably they were
greenish blue, and I could not detect any spots ; if there had
been some it is unlikely that I should have seen them in the
shelter of the nest. In the morning following the robbery, a
prolonged search was rewarded by the finding of two tiny specks
of blue, absolutely useless, and a small piece of shell which, from
the degree of concavity, I concluded had formed part of the
larger end of one of the eggs. It was freely speckled with dots
of brown and rusty, but these were mostly, although not entirely,
removed on the application of moisture; unfortunately the
fragment suffered so much in my endeavours to hold and wash it

Mr. W. H. Workman,
that further attempts to remove the spots became hopeless, and I
remain in doubt whether they were proper to the egg or not: they
had a very natural appearance. This fragment was of a darker
shade than I had previously supposed the eggs to have been,
quite as dark as those of the Hedge Accentor.
Both of the birds were in full colour--for the female also
has a sufficiently apparent breeding plumage, although this does
not seem to be referred to in books.
For some days the male mourned disconsolately at the site
of the nest--and then suggested another, but the female declined
with thanks. The latter, I regret to say, does not look well and
does not improve. It was weak of me to have allowed her to
continue sitting.
December 12.--The male single-handed has since built a
non-globular nest, with an aperture fully three inches in diame-
ter, but like all " cock's nests " constructed by Weavers, it has
been picked to pieces. Now, however, both birds are busy over
another nest.--R. P.

Most of us bird lovers, as the Spring comes round, begin
to feel a sort of longing for the country, its hedge-rows, fields
and marshes. I think this sort of thing attacks those who live
in towns more than our more fortunate fellow-workers who have
the country always around them ; I know it is this kind of
complaint that comes to me every Spring, and I begin to make
arrangements with friends, see to camera, look up maps and find
out where one can get good photos and a chance of adding to
one's collection of eggs and lantern slides ; by the production of
the latter a great deal of pleasure can be given to our less
fortunate friends by shewing them on the screen ; and such
pretty pictures they make too, when enlarged by the lantern.
They are greatly appreciated by Field Club meetings, and a few
bird photos thrown in amongst the many botany and geology
papers give a little life to the proceedings.

It was on one of these excursions that my friend and I
started by the 9.20 a. 111. train for Burgan, from which we had a
rather rough drive of about six miles across a strange boggy
country called the Manchus, where the road is built up with
metal 10 or 12 feet above the bog.
A few birds on the way however kept us amused :--Reed
Buntings, Meadow Pipits, Corn Buntings, Sedge Warblers,
House Martins, Swallows, Swifts, and Pied Wagtails, besides
many commoner birds.
Our stopping place was a little harbour where there is a
ferry across one of the rivers that flow into Bough Neagh.
Here we met our boat with two men and a fine Irish water-dog.
It was now about 11 o'clock, so we hurried our things, which
were many, into the little boat, the spritsail was got up, and
away we went flying before a nice easterly breeze.
The first bird I noted was an old Cormorant drying his
wings on a post, after the style of the German imperial eagle.
He soon flew off over the vast expanse of muddy water to his
fishing, and w 7 e sailed on towards the isles. Numbers of Swifts
and Sandmartins were hawking above our heads, and now and
again a Tern or Black-headed Gull would relieve the monotony.
We passed an old ruin where Kestrels nest every year, and, with
our glasses, we could make out the old birds flying round the tower.
The wind had fallen rather light, so our men had taken to the
oars so as to hurry us to our first island, Corrigan by name ; we,
in the meantime, got on our waders, as the water round the
islands is so shallow that one always has to wade ashore.
We pulled on till the boat stuck on the big stones ; out
jumped the dog, then the men, and we followed when the
lightened boat was pulled into still shallower water.
My friend had for the first time visited this island about
two years ago, when he found it covered with Redshanks' nests.
Bast year he went back and found no Redshanks, but in their
place a great colony of Black-headed Gulls, and this year, as the
reader will see, there was not very much of anything.
By this time we had landed and spread out to look for
nests. Over our heads were screaming Redshanks, Black-headed
Gulls, and Terns, but for a while we came on nothing. At last I

noticed one of the men to my right stooping down, and when I
got up to him, I found he had got a Reed Bunting's beautiful
little nest with 5 eggs, and lovely they looked, the ground stone
colour, with purple-brown streaks and blotches.
We now walked on a little farther and found a Sandpiper's
nest, built in the side of a clump of rushes, quite differently
situated from those I found a year or two ago in Scotland, which
were built in the sides of steep banks.
Our next find was some nests of the Common Tern built
close to water on the short grass, containing two eggs each ; and
a little way on we found a nest or two of the Black-headed Gull
constructed of withered reeds.
On the way back I found another Reed Buntings' nest
in the centre of a tuft of rushes, which would have escaped my
notice had not the bird flown off right from under my feet.
It was a tiny little nest, made of grass and lined with hair. Just
then the dog brought us a young Snipe just able to fly ; its
markings were exquisite ; dark velvet brown, light brown, and
golden yellow on the long feathers coming from the base of the
wing ; the dog had not hurt it in the least, and, after examining it,
we let it away. It flew for a yard or two, then dived into the
rushes and was quickly lost to sight.
On the western side of the island we found nests of Coots
and Waterhens in most exposed places along the shore.
It was now two o'clock and away to the westward had
gathered a heavy black cloud portending both wind and rain.
We waded out to our little boat, the men got to the oars and pre-
pared for a long pull dead to windward, to the next island we
intended visiting. After we had started a while down came the
rain followed by a strong breeze of wind. Soon white waves
were breaking all around 11s, and every now and then a sea would
come over the side ; however here we were, and we had to make
the best of it ; between the rain coming down and the sea
coming over it did not prove the dryest of entertainments.
I11 about three-quarters of an hour we again hit bottom,
and waded ashore on a small island whose name I do not know.
Here we found any amount of Redshanks flying about and
screaming over-head. We came on a number of old and new

nests, but none containing eggs or young till we were just about
to leave, when my friend shouted to me that he had found a
Redshank's nest with three young and a chipped egg. I got the
camera fixed up, and took a photo in a gale of wind and rain.
The chicks kept moving all the time, and I was quite surprised to
find that it came out fairly well. Our next find was a Lapwing's
nest with four eggs, and just as we returned to the boat one of
the men found a Mallard's nest, carefully lined with grass and
down, (the latter by the way is dark brown with white centres and
greyish tips), containing eight olive-green eggs. The other birds
I noted were Corncrakes, Sedge Warblers, and Reed Buntings.
Another half-hour's row to windward brought us to our
starting place, where our car met us to take us homewards after
a most enjoyable day with the birds, our only regret being that the
weather was so unfavourable for using the camera ; but we hope
for better luck next time.

By Arthur G. Butter, Ph.D., etc.
This elegant little finch has received the name of " Misto
Seed-Finch" in Sclater and Hudson's "Argentine Ornithology."
It is imported from time to time from Buenos Ayres, though not
in very great numbers : hitherto, as far as I have been able to
ascertain, it has not been bred in captivity. Dr. Russ, in his
' Handbuch ' says very little about this bird, which he calls the
"Yellow-bellied Finch"; and, judging from his remarks, it
would appear that he never possessed healthy examples: he
describes it as " rare in the Bird-market," and observes that " Dr.
Franken does not praise the song, and Sclrleehtendal character-
izes it as particularly shrill, resembling both that of the Grass-
hopper Warbler and that of the home-bred Serin. Gentle,
peaceable, but without character."
From his larger work, it appears that Dr. Franken only
had one example, arrd Dr. Russ only secured a pair from Jamrach

Dr. A. G. Butler,
in the autumn of 1876, which reached him in such a sickly con-
dition that they soon both died. He concludes with the following
remarks :--" Should the bird hereafter appear more numerously in
the trade, it might indeed be regarded as a desirable gain to the
bird-room ; as it shows itself by far more gentle and peaceable
than its allies. Unfortunately there is up to the present time
little prospect of this, as most Brazilian birds are only brought
to us in small numbers."
In September 1903 Mr. James Housden was fortunate
enough to secure an unusually large consigmeut of kS. arvensis,
two of which came into my possession, and two into that of our
Editor ; of the latter one has unhappily since died, but mine are
still in excellent health although they have shown no inclination
whatever to breed. Mr. Seth-Smith thinks my birds may be two
males, and his may have been two females ; yet none of them
have attempted to sing: in the face of the account of the bird's
habits given by Mr. Hudson this is remarkable. The following
is his description :--
" This is a slender, graceful bird, less than the Canary in
size, the whole upper plumage yellowish olive, with dun mark-
ings, the lower surface of a dull yellow. The female is a little
smaller than the male, and her colours are somewhat dimmer.
This species is resident and gregarious in the Argentine Republic,
and in autumn frequently congregates in flocks of several thou-
sands. They are not so universally distributed as the Chingolo,
and are not wood-birds, but frequent open plains abounding in
thistles and other coarse herbage, which affords them shelter.
In cultivated districts, where their food is most abundant, they
are excessively numerous, and, after the harvest has been
gathered, frequent the fields in immense flocks. While feeding,
the flocks scatter over a large area of ground, being broken up
into small companies of a dozen or more birds, and at such
times are so intent on their food that a person can walk about
amongst them without disturbing them. They take flight very
suddenly, bursting into a thousand chirping, scolding notes,
pursue each other through the air, and after wheeling about the
field for a minute or two, suddenly drop down into the grass
again and are silent as before.

Iu August they begin to sing, here and there an individual
being heard in the fields ; but when the weather grows warmer
they repair to the plantations in vast numbers, and, sitting on the
branches, sing in a concert of innumerable voices, which pro-
duces a great volume of confused sound, and which often con-
tinues for hours at a time without intermission.
By-and-by these pleasant choirs break up, the birds all
scattering over the plains and fields to woo and build, and it is
then first discovered that the male has a peculiar and very sweet
song. Apart from his fellows, he acquires a different manner of
singing, soaring up from his stand on the summit of a bush or
stalk, and beginning his song the moment he quits his perch.
Ascending he utters a series of long, melodious notes, not loud,
but very distinctly enunciated and increasing iu volume; at a
height of fifty or sixty yards he pauses, the notes becoming
slower; then, as he descends with a graceful spiral flight, the
wings outstretched and motionless, the notes also fall, becoming
lower, sweeter, and more impressive till he reaches the earth.
After alighting the song continues, the notes growing longer,
thinner, and clearer, until they dwindle to the merest threads of
sound, and cease to be audible except to a person standing within
a few yards of the songster. The song is quite unique in
character, and its great charm is iu its gradual progress from the
somewhat thick notes at the commencement to the thin tremu-
lous tones with which the bird returns to earth, and which
change again to the excessively attenuated sounds at the end.
The nest is deep, well-built, and well-concealed, sometimes
resting on the ground, but frequently raised above it. It con-
tains five long pointed eggs, with a white or bluish-white ground-
colour, and thickly spotted with brown. I have frequently found
the eggs of the Molothrzcs in its nest, but have never been able to
see this Sparrow feeding, or followed by, a young Molothrus.
Possibly, if it ever hatches the parasitical egg at all, the voracious
young Cow-bird is starved by the delicate food supplied by its
foster-parents."
Doubtless the colouring of the eggs of the species of
Sycalis led Mr. Hudson to speak of them as Sparrows, since they

Dr. A. G. Butler,
are certainly more nearly related to tlie Serins and Siskins, as
Burmeister points out.
The flight of S. arvensis in an aviary differs entirely from
that of the more heavily built Saffron-fiucli; indeed it far more
nearly resembles that of the Grey Singing-finch, having the
dancing irregular character of a white or blue butterfly. A he
only note I have heard hitherto is a rather shrill short chirp: I
must confess I should greatly like to hear the elaborate Lark-like
song described by Mr. Hudson ; but if it is necessary to provide
an aviary sixty yards high, in order to induce the bird to sing it,
I fear that will never fall to my lot.
Although the nesting-habit seems to be altogether unlike
that of the Saffron-finch and more characteristic of a Bunting, I
see no reason why a well-authenticated pair should not breed
in a rough outdoor aviary : in my birdroom, where many Saffron-
finches have been bred without the least difficulty, the Yellowish
Finch could not be expected to build, the floor being of concrete
with a thick layer of sand and no vegetation of any kind.
On November ist 1904 our former member Mr. F. W. H.
Daly wrote to me for the identification of two small birds sold
under the name of Saffron-finches. Mr. Daly says that some few
years back a considerable number came into Southampton,
apparently in one importation ; several dealers had them and
sold them as " original wild canaries." Being satisfied that both
birds were hens, Mr. Daly asked me to accept one and send him
the name of the species: it arrived a few days later and I told
him that it was, as I had supposed, a Yellowish Finch, but rather
smaller than my birds; so that I thought it possible it might be
the subspecies separated under the name Sycalis minor: on turn-
ing it in with my other two the discrepancy in size seemed less
marked, and is probably only of sexual value.
According to the "Catalogue of Birds in the British
Museum " A. arvensis measures 5-2 inches ; the female 5-5 inches,
A. minor 4-6 inches in both sexes ; but Burmeister gives the
measurement of the latter under its synonym of S. hilarii as
4 inches and 8 lines, whilst Dr. Sclater gives the total length of
N. arvensis under its synonym of A. luteola as 5 inches. The fact

ioi
is that it is practically impossible for two independent workers to
be absolutely agreed as to the exact length of a living bird, when
they only have skins to measure from ; the measurements of the
culmen, wing, tail and tarsus might easily correspond because
they are fixed in the fully adult bird, but stretching or shrinkage
must affect the total length of a skin. Undoubtedly age greatly
affects not only the size but the colouring of many species; and
I am satisfied that if a series of Saffron-finches (S. flaveola) were
to be killed when one, two, three, and four years of age, they
would make four as pretty distinct-looking subspecies as any of
those ascribed to S. arvejisis; whether they would show such
differences in the outer tail-feathers as characterize chrysops
when compared with S. arve?isis I cannot say; but in other
respects there would be abundant distinctive characters. For
this reason, I should regard with some suspicion the constancy
to locality of any forms nearly related to an abundant species of
Sycalis, with the knowledge that another species in the same
genus differed at various ages in quite as marked a manner : in
this I might err, but with some excuse for doing so. Inasmuch
as S. aiwe?isis is a placid, slender bird, with a pleasing fluttering
action on the wing; whereas S.flaveola is a tempestuous thick-
set bird, with a headlong direct flight, I should not consider the
two nearly related ; this again is evidenced by their different
methods of nidification; so that one species may have local
variations, and the other only changes of plumage regulated by
age ; only these facts, if they exist, need to be established.
I hope that I may now have both sexes of this pretty little
species; and that, in the coming year, I may be fortunate
enough to learn something from personal experience of its
life-history.

VARIATION IN GOLD AND SILVER PHEASANTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978756083333333" page_id="32656570"  page_num="102" year="" vol="">
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
On account of the peculiar position they occupy among
domestic birds as species of recent domestication and maintained
in limited numbers for ornament only, the Gold and Silver
Pheasants {Chrysolophuspictus and Gennceus nycthemerus ) offer an
interesting field for enquiry to the student of variation.
That the former species, independently of the taint of
Amherst ( Chrysolophus amherstitz) blood which has crept in of
late years, varies considerably in the depth of tint of the golden
portions of its plumage is patent to everyone ; but this variation
is due, to some extent at any rate, I believe, to the conditions
under which the individual has moulted, though not in every
case.
In any case, it is interesting to note that only the
yellow and orange tints are affected, the rest of the plumage
remaining normal. This is well exemplified in a specimen in the
British Museum collection, in which the ruff even, is quite a straw-
colour, while the breast is as red as in perfect specimens. This
variation, to whatever cause due, is thus analogous to the " duck-
wing " forms of the domestic cock, in which the red portions of
the typical Jungle Fowl ( Galius gallus) plumage are replaced by
various shades of yellow or by white, the black underparts and
tail retaining their colour.
I have, however, once seen a cock--a common rough-bred
bird in the Calcutta Market,--which in addition to cream-
coloured upper parts, had the under surface and tail slate-
coloured, all tints being thus weakened together.
To return to the Golden Pheasant ; a well-marked
"sport" is known to occur in the species in captivity in the
form Chrysolophus obscurus, which is regarded by Messrs.
Tegetmeier and Ogilvie-Grant as a variet}&apos; only. In this bird
the throat and face are black or blackish instead of buff, the
scapulars blackish instead of crimson, and the centre-tail-
feathers barred with brown and black like the lateral pairs,
instead of being spotted with brown on a black ground. The type
of this form, in the British Museum collection, has all the

appearance of a true species, but, nevertheless, I believe, the two
great authorities quoted above are perfectly right in their
estimate of it.
As a matter of fact, there is now in the Zoological
Society&apos;s collection an intermediate specimen, in the form of
one of the individuals confined in the new Canal Bank Aviary.
In this the face and throat are blackish, as also are the scapulars,
but the tail-feathers are marked as in the normal type. More-
over, when in mature plumage it was indistinguishable from two
birds acquired with it last February in the same garb, which have
become almost normal specimens. I say almost normal, for they
have dark scapulars, but to this point I shall recur later. What
I want to emphasize now is the fact that the immature plumage
of the dark-throated bird could hardly have been typical obscurus,
since the hens of that species, and presumably the young cocks,
were noticeably darker than those of the normal form, as is well
shown in Elliot's plate of the variety. (Mon. Phasianidce).
The variation in the colour of the face and marking of the
tail would appear to be discontinuous, but with regard to the
scapulars, there appears to be a complete gradation from the
blackish ones of the obscurus form, with scarcely a trace of red,
to a full scarlet as light as that of the breast. The most usual tint
would appear to be intermediate, a crimson, which is that shown by
the fine bird recent^ in the end pen of the Eastern Pheasantry
at the Regent's Park Gardens. An equally brilliant specimen in
the Canal Bank Aviary has, however, dark scapulars, in this case
deep steel-blue edged with red. A similar blue-and-red coloura-
tion of the scapulars I found in a bird in the Battersea Park
covered aviary, where also there was a particularly fine bird with
the light scarlet scapulars ; indeed, it was the unusually bright
appearance of this bird, with his shoulders concolorous with the
breast, which led me to study this variation. And it is after
studying thirteen living specimens, six at Battersea, two at
Victoria Park, and five at the Zoological Gardens, that I came to
the conclusion that the variation in this respect is continuous, as
stated above.
Examination of the British Museum specimens confirmed
me in this, though I did not find any normal pictus so dark as

obscurus there, and only two with the scarlet scapulars, both fine
Chinese specimens.
I have no reason to believe that the colour of the
scapulars varies with age, although, as the spurs develop so little
in this species, the age of any fully-coloured specimen is
practically impossible to make out.
In the hen Gold Pheasant the only variation I have
observed is a wash of yellow on the breast of one recently in the
Zoological Gardens ; I may mention that the only one I saw in
Calcutta imported direct from China was identical with European-
bred examples, of which we had some in the Zoological Garden
there. The lieu of the obscuius I have never seen, and the variety
now appears, unfortunately, to be very rare, if not extinct.
There is, however, in the British Museum a very remark-
able young male, bred, long ago apparently, in the Zooiogical
Gardens. This bird has a normal tail, and a body of uniform
brown, rufous on the head, breast, and upper tail-coverts, with
none of the bold dark pencilling normal in the hens and young
of this species, except a little on the wing-coverts. This may
perhaps be compared to the frequent variety of the domestic
fowl in which the tail is normal, while the rest of the body is
almost uniform cinnamon in both sezes, and this second instance
of a tendency to a similar variation in two closely-allied genera
like Chrysoloplms and Gallus is of much interest.
In the male of the Silver Pheasant, on the other hand, I
have never seen any marked variation ; some specimens are
more strongly pencilled than others, and an immature male
acquired by the Calcutta Zoological Garden in my time was
rather remarkable in assuming a much longer crest and tail than
an adult acquired together with it ; indeed, it was the finest bird
of the species I ever saw, and only by its shorter spurs could
it be known as the junior of its companion. But on the whole
this sex of the Silver Pheasant is remarkably constant; in the
hen, however, I have recently observed a variation which appears
to me of peculiar interest. The normal hen is a dull brown bird
with the lateral tail feathers pencilled black and white; such a
specimen may be seen in the Bird Gallery of the British Museum,
and one such was procured in March last year by the Zoological

Society to mate with their male, and is now in the Eastern
Pheasantry. Bnt along with it came another and smaller bird,
with the nnderparts and flanks of a pencilled black and white
very similar to what is seen in the immature male of this species-
The bird is not a young male, for it has shown no signs of
changing its colour, and since then--recently in fact--I have
seen no less than three birds like this in the aviary at Victoria
Park ; they are the only hens of the species there, and appear of
the normal size. Of the two hens at Battersea Park--where,
however, it is not possible to get close up to the wire of the
Pheasantr}&apos;, whence close observation is difficult--one very nearly
approaches this pencilled type, and the other shows a decided
approximation to it, as far as I could make out.
I11 the British Museum I find a very perfect example of this
variety, which Mr. Ogilvie-Grant tells me he knows to be an
aged bird ; it has the pencilling of the under surface very clear
and distinct, and the tail very strongly pencilled. This is a
Hertfordshire specimen, but another marked " China " has an
even more boldly marked tail, with a breast inclining to that of the
normal bird, with the minute black stippling, found even in the
latter, more strongly marked. I may mention that three typical
birds from Kuatun vary much in this tail-pencilling, and another
normal one marked " Amoy Aviary " also has it very strong, so
that this point seems altogether variable.
But the type with pencilled underparts seems to represent
a fairly discontinuous variation, if variation it be. Mr. Ogilvie-
Grant regards it as a partial assumption of male plumage, and its
similarity to the livery of the immature male strongly confirms
this. But in this case it is remarkable that it should go no
further, and also that out of seven living examples examined as
above, at least five should display it ; the case needs more
investigation, and the fact that in the domestic fowl at least
three forms of female may be correlated with similar black-
breasted red males must be borne in mind--these being the fawn-
breasted " Partridge " lieu of the Jungle-fowl colour, the
" wlieaten " type, and the pencilled-breasted hen of the Partridge
Cochin, with various intermediates.
At all events, I think enough has been said to show that

Rev. C. D. Farrar,
the domestic Gold and Silver Pheasants, in addition to their great
beauty, recommend themselves by exhibiting variations of great
scientific interest; for such as I have above drawn attention to
would be regarded as at least of subspecific value, if found
occurring locally in Pheasants in a state of nature.
THE BREEDING OF THE " RUFICAUDA."
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Years ago I w r as looking in the window of a London bird
shop, when I saw two small birds in a cage that I, at any rate,
had never seen before. They were sage green on top, with red
masks and curious little white-ringed spots all over the upper
part of their breasts. I looked them up in a book and found
the} 7 were Rufous-tailed Grassfinclies from Australia. The price
was something too awful. I believe the man (it was near Port-
land Road) asked -#5 for the pair. It was many years ago, mind.
Now the price is just as absurdly low.
Bathilda ruficauda is a bird calculated to fill the harvest
of a quiet eye, but would not please those who prefer the painful
and gaudy colours of a Macaw.
For years I have never been without some Rufous-tails ;
and many years ago I should have got the medal for being the
first to breed them but for a bit of ill luck. I kept my then
Ruficaudas in a big garden aviary full of growing bushes. Here,
in due course, they made a beautiful nest in a bush, but it was
about as frail as the lady's hat of to-day. I may say, in passing,
that my birds never made a nest anywhere else, in fact they would
never look at German cages or cocoa-nut husks. The eggs were
duly hatched, and all went swimmingly for the first eight days.
I could already feel that medal. The youngsters were fully
fledged and just ready to fly, when one afternoon there came on
such rain that, as a friend said to me grimly, "it seemed as if the
angels were emptying buckets out of the sky." Several of these
buckets descended on the poor frail little nest, and when I went
to look, there was only a sodden lump of hay, and five little
dead Ruficaudas. As I brought them into the house I felt like

Mrs. Poyser did when the Miss Irwins admired her farm. " Oh,
Mrs. Peyser," they used to sajr, " I envy yon your dairy and I
envy you your chickens, and what a beautiful thing a farm house
is, to be sure ! " " An' I say, 3^es, a farm house is a fine thing
for them as look on, an' don't know the liftin' an' the stan'in',
an' the worritin' o' the inside, as belongs to't." " It's your dead
chicks," as she remarked on another historic occasion, " talc' the
longest to hatch." But for that "little shower" I should have
been " Ruficauda " medalist.
A few months later, I read an account of the successful
rearing of a brood of " Ruficaudas" in Scotland, and as I perused
the story, I thought of the words of a miner friend of mine:
"When a man's mad he loilces reading owt that'll make him
madder; he duunot want to be soothed, yo' see." Was it not
Edgar Allen Poe who sang that he dwelt alone in a laud of
moan ? Well, that was what I did, that da3^ at any rate.
For two years I was forced to give up 1113&apos;' birds, and only
began this summer with just a few. Amongst them I purchased
a reputed pair of "Ruficaudas"; but the moment they came, I
knew the3^ were two hens. For long enough I could not light
on a cock. I was offered any number of hens as pairs, but had
the strength of mind to refuse them, though most solemnly
assured that I was standing in 1113&amp;quot; own light. At last I heard of
a cock from Sheffield, and I lost no time in sending for him. I
shall never forget the jo3 r of that bird when I put him in with
the two hens. Depend upon it, when a man--or a bird--forgets
what womankind can give him, he is nearer six by three than I
should care to be. He sat on a bough between the two, and told
them as plain as a bird could, that if either dear charmer were
absent how happy he could be with t'other. The way those two
hens fought was a caution ; and to save the life of one, I had to
intervene. The elder of the two hens was clearly of the opinion
of a poacher I once knew : " Fight," he used to say, " does seem
to sweeten a man's victuals"; for after a particularly vicious
onslaught, she would fly down to the seed tray and make a
hearty meal.
We learn b3 7 our mistakes, so I registered a vow that if
ever I had the luck to get a nest again, I would see that it had a

Rev. C. D. Farrar,
cover over it; for the weather is so erratic in Yorkshire that one
never knows whether it is the morning of Eden or the eve of
the Flood.
It was not very long before the hen began building a
pretty domed nest of hay in a bush, with a little circular hole
towards the light. The foundation was fairly solid, but the
dome was exceedingly flimsy, only calculated to keep out a little
sunshine, but no rain I am certain. Eggs were duly laid, but I
believe I foolishly touched them, for they disappeared. That
piece of insensate folly had come home to roost, and it was days
before Hope reset her bow of Promise.
One morning when I was filling the seed pots, I happened
to glance up, and saw what I thought to be a ragged bundle of
hay. The performance was now lifted into what is called in
the theatre a situation of suspense. I got up and went tip-toeing
to the sticks and peeped a second, very much as the mate of a
vessel goes to his binnacle, and then taking a look aloft, resumes
his watch. This bit of luck lifted up my heart, like a bit of
sunshine on a gloomy road. The nest was rather an untidy
structure, as ragged, in fact, as a six-days' beard.
About this time I felt it advisable to remove the second
lady, as the fighting was early and late. I was reminded of the
Scotch minister who was a noted boxer, and proposed to teach
his man to fight. He landed on his chest with his right--down
went John. Again the minister's left found its way to his nose.
This was repeated over and over again, John meanwhile retreat-
ing to the wall, and once there the minister continued, hammer
and tongs, left, right, left, right, for ten minutes. At last he
Stopped, and said "Now, John, what do you think of that?"
" Faith, minister," said John, " I'll fecht 11a mail&apos;." Well, that
was what hen No. 2 said. It's easy to sing " Dare to be a
Daniel," but it is none so easy to do. The morning I found that
second nest I went out of the aviary with a face as cheerful as
the sun.
For some days I felt as nervous as a school-boy who is
going to be thrashed in the near future; for I wanted to know if
there were eggs, but I did not dare to look, much less to feel.
However, as Mrs. " Ruficauda " remained on the nest, and

once or twice I caught Master " Ruficauda" paying shame-faced
visits thereto, I concluded that eggs had arrived. Once or twice
I saw the hen returning to the nest from the seed tray, like a
Chinese Empress returning to her disturbed dominions, and this
made me happy and joyful of heart.
I was watching late one evening in September, when I
saw the Bearded Tits incautiously approach too near the nest.
In a moment Mrs. "Ruficauda" came bouncing out like a
veritable little fury, and the discomfited Tits fled incontinent.
Now I felt certain that the hen was sitting hard.
At the end of about three weeks I began to hear voices --
voces clamantium !--and the volume of sound increasing daily,
told me that the little beggars were as wick as whins ; a healthy
family of youngsters, protesting with yellow open - throated
sound that they were ready for another meal.
The cock now visited the nest no longer by stealth, but
openljr and in a most " brazzen " way, as we say up North.
Sometimes if he is too incautious his lady gives him a bit of her
lip. It always reminds me of what I heard a little boy ask his
father. "Father," he said, "what is the difference between
conversation and talk? " "All the difference in the world, lad,"
was the answer. " Your mother converses with other folk ; but
she talks to me."
I have seen Bathilda ruficauda take a bath, but it is on
rare occasions. When he does, I always think of the young
lady who met an old friend but lately returned from Marienbad.
"Well," she said, " doctor, where have you been ? " " Oh, my
dear, I'm just back from Marienbad, taking the baths, you
know." She, innocently--"Really! that was a change for you,
wasn't it?"
The song of B. ruficauda is all but inaudible. It always
reminds me of the remarks of a plain spoken member of his
flock to the minister. " Well, Jock," said the minister, "how
did you like my sermon yesterda}^? " " Weel, meenister, sin' ye
ba'e speared," was the reply, "I maun just tell ye that I ha'e
three objections to't. In the first place ye read every word o' t,
in the second place ye did 11a read it weel, and in the third place

The New York Zoological Park.
Now that the young are gone, I do not feel half as much
interest in those " Ruficaudas" as I did a month ago. Who is it
that says " The enjoyment is the pursuit, and this ceases when
our hand closes down on the prize"?
THE NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL PARK.
We have received from Mr. C. William Beebe, the Curator
of Ornithology at the New York Zoological Park, some copies
of the valuable and beautifully illustrated Bulletin of the Zoo-
logical Society of New York ; and some of the notes therein on the
birds in the Zoological Park are of very great interest.
The Park comprises about two hundred and seventy acres,
part of which is in a wild, wooded condition, while much is given
up to the collection of animals. The number of wild birds
which, apparently attracted by the protection offered to them,
nest within the boundary is remarkable; Mr. Beebe's list enu-
merates sixty-two species, all of which have reared young in a
wild state in the Park. This seems an extraordinary number when
one considers that it is actually in the City of New York.
Mr. Beebe writes :--"The most interesting wild bird which
has been observed breeding in the Zoological Park is the Law-
rence Warbler ( Helminthophila lawrencei, Herrick). On June
13th of the present j^ear Dr. Wiegmann and myself found a male

species of Cuckoos, the Belted Kingfisher and many others suc-
cessfully rear their young nearly every year.
Mr. Beebe's notes on hatching and rearing some sea birds
from eggs obtained on Cobb Island, Virginia, are specially in-
teresting. In July 1903 be made a trip to this locality, and on his
return brought home some two dozen eggs of various sea-birds,
including those of the Black Skimmer, Common Tern, Laughing
Gull, Clapper Rail and Green Heron, all being in advanced
stages of incubation and intended for embryological study. At
first no special care was taken of the eggs, and three days
elapsed between the time of their collection and the date of their
examination. They were brought to New York in an empty
Kodak case, and several were cracked on the way. The tem-
perature during these three days ranged from 60 to So degrees,
which was sufficient to keep the embryos alive, and, when
examined, their vigor was so pronounced that they were all
placed in an incubator in a temperature of 102 deg. with the
result that almost all of them hatched within from one to five
days.
The young birds which were kept under careful obser-
vation were Terns ( Sterna hirunda), a Black Skimmer ( Rhynchops
nigra), a Laughing Gull (Lams atticilla ), and a Green Heron
(.Butorides virescens). All were kept together in a large wooden
box, with a glass front and wire roof, and with a flooring of fine
white sand.
At a temperature of no deg. in the direct rays of the
sun they panted violently, at 75 deg. they shivered ; and 90 deg.
in the shade seemed to satisfy them best.
It was noticed that while yet wholly within the shell the
young Terns uttered a peep, peep, much like a young chicken,
but the instant they left the shell they uttered the typical
tear-r-r of the old birds, though of course in a very feeble tone.
When about a week old they did not feed so well as at first, and
a new diet was tried. "Heretofore," the author writes, " the fish
(tiny kiltie-fish) was half boiled, chopped and mixed with ants'
eggs. Now a hearty meal was given to the ever ravenous Wood
Ibises, and two hours later a little judicious teasing persuaded
them to disgorge a mass of finely comminuted fish, sweet-

smelling and, I hoped, adapted to the digestion of the little
Terns. I was right, as it proved, for at one feeding they ate
more than they had done the entire day."
At this age it was noticed that when frightened the Terns
run to the darkest corner to hide, while the Skimmer gives
several side flicks with his feet, " making thus in an instant a little
cavity into which he sinks, drops his head close to the sand and.
--disappears, his back almost flush with the general level of the
sand. It is a marvellous bit of instinctive jugglery."
At the age of iS days the Skimmer still had the white
egg-tootli on the tip of his upper mandible.
We are not told whether the young birds were actually
reared to maturity.
In conclusion, Mr. Beebe writes:
" A.--The call, food, and alarm notes of the Common
Terns, Black Skimmers, and Laughing Gulls are instinctive;
not taught by the parents nor learned by imitation. The one
positive proof of this would warrant the assertion.
" B.--The remarkable disparity in the length of the
mandibles in the adult Black Skimmer is foreshadowed even in
the embryo and in the newly-hatched bird.
" C.--My experience with a dozen Terns and Gulls
showed that these individuals prefer fresh water to salt.
" D.--There is absolutely no 'instinctive' fear of man or
other objects which enter quietly into the environment of the
young birds, but a sudden shadow or loud noise causes them to
perform certain acts--wholly instinctive--which have for their
object an escape from supposed danger. Under such conditions
the Terns (which we remember are not so protectively coloured,
as the Skimmer), take time to run to the darkest corner or
shadow before squatting, while the Skimmer crouches instantly,
and with two or three instructive flicks of feet and legs, almost
buries himself.
" E.--The sight of small but entire fish excites a newly-
hatched Skimmer much more than does macerated fish. Terns
are not so excited until after the first week.

but is acquired very slowly in this way. By imitation it is learned
quickly, and is performed successfully within a few minutes.
" G.--The art of flying is wholly instinctive. The Terns
learning the use of their wings as soon as the primaries are
large enough to support them."
Experiments have been tried, the object of which has been
to induce Ospreys to stay, and if possible to nest in the Park,
where there is plenty of water well stocked with fish ; but up to
the present the young birds which have been obtained for the
purpose have flown away, never to return.
This publication is illustrated with admirable photographs,
one of which represents several young Red Flamingoes ( Phceni -
coplerus ruber) which have been obtained from the colony in the
Bahamas, and are doing well in the Park.
TAME SWALLOWS.
A remarkable instance of the degree to which Swallows
can be tamed is narrated in the Bullethi de la Sociele National
d'Accliniatation de France * for August. M. G. Pays-Mellier
considers the Swallow the most intelligent, amusing, and
interesting of all insectivorous birds.
Every year, for some years past, he has reared from the
nest, some of the early broods of Swallows. He allows them
complete liberty, aud during the summer months these birds may
be seen, flying at great heights, but always coming at the least call
to perch on his finger, and remaining there without the slightest
fear of any number of strangers. They always know their
owner and fly to him whenever they catch sight of him, and very
quickly despatch the mealworms or moths which he always
gives them.
M. Pays-Mellier allows his Swallows perfect liberty
during the day time, and they may be seen flying with their wild
companions to great heights, or chasing the insects which hover
close to the ground. Or they may frequently be observed
perched upon the house-tops, uttering their delightful little

song. In the evening the}&apos;- are generally put into a large cage
for the night, and given their freedom again at dawn.
Formerly M. Pays-Mellier kept them the whole year
through, putting them into a warm aviary with his other
insectivorous birds during the autumn and winter. Here they
kept fairly well, but in spite of every care and attention did not
seem happy, and during recent years only the earliest broods
have been taken, and towards the time of their natural departure
they have been allowed to join their wild companions in their
flight to more congenial climes.
This is a very delightful form of aviculture, which might
well be practised in this country.

<bodyText confidence="0.93087512" page_id="32656582"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In looking over a recent number of the "Emu" I noticed an
article by E. Degen, Parson's Green, London, entitled "Australian Birds in
the Zoological Gardens, London," in which the author states that only 60,
or about one-twelfth of the 760 species are to be found there. He continues
" it may readily be inferred from this that a really splendid opportunity
offers itself to an Australian visitor or a returning colonist to supplement
the list and fill in existing gaps. This defect could be remedied with such
species without inconvenience to an enthusiastic traveller, and without
any particular risk to live stock which do not depend on insect food
exclusively."
With reference to this matter I would like to say that it would give
me pleasure to contribute specimens were the expenses in transit not so
heavy ; but, as far as I have gone, either in exporting or importing birds, I
find the freight and shipping charges so extreme, that they quite act as a
deterrent.
Some time back I arranged to send two pairs of Crested Pigeons
(Ocyphaps lophotes) and one pair of Bronzewings (Phaps chalcoptera) to a
relative in London, but when on the steamer the purser demanded 10/- for
each bird, and then there was in addition the same amount as a gratuity
to the butcher -- in all #3 10/-, without cartage, seed etc. Under these
conditions I declined to send them, but when they went later on with a
relative, the cost was 30/-, the purser asking #1, beside the fee to the man
in charge of them.
These expenses contribute greatly no doubt to the value of the birds
on arrival in England. Only the other day I was surprised to see the Satin

Sir, --Can you inform me to what age Rosellas usually attain ? I
lost one early this year which was hatched out in the Australian Spring
(Oct.) of 1876; came into my possession in April 1S77 and died 011 Feb. 22nd
1904, so that he was 27 years and 5 months old. Is this a record age ?
Judging from my written description only, Dr. W. T. Greene is of
opinion that 'Joe} - ' was a cross between Platycercuspallidiceps and Platycer-
cns eximius. In body plumage he was entirely A*, pallidiceps, but when I first
had him his head was bright red. At the end of his first year's moult the
front half became yellow, and after the second year's moult the whole head
was yellow with the exception of a patch about the size of a shilling, which
remained red all his life ; the yellow was also of a deeper hue than that of
the Mealy Rosella, being about the colour of a lemon-rind.
He was a cage-bird, and hung out of doors all day in Summer and for
a few hours on the warmest days in Winter. He was fed on Indian corn,
hemp and canary seeds, all kinds of green foods and fruits as they came in
season ; but his most particular fancy was animal fat--either fat ham or
bacon, or butter, and he used to have a lump about the size of a pea of one
or the other two or three times a week and would leave any other food to
take it. Is this liking for fat a peculiarity of Rosellas ? If so, may it not
be that in their wild state and in their native land they obtain seeds of an
oily nature which they miss when in captivity, and animal fat would supply
the want?
At any rate it agreed with ' Joey,' as he never had an ailment of any
kind until after he had completed his 27th year, when his digestive powers
seemed to fail, and he had fits at intervals--the last proving fatal.
He piped two tunes and repeated many short sentences, and was
altogether a desirable little companion.
Trusting these notes may prove of interest to those of your readers
who may keep or breed Rosellas. Winifred M. Sopp.

journal, about the "alleged" sheep killing hy the Kea iu New Zealand.
The word " alleged" struck me as very funny reading in a book on birds at
this late date. I was but a lad in New Zealand about 1S64-5, when the
first reports came in about what the Keas were doing, and you can imagine
how the idea was scoffed at, when we find forty years later it is not believed
in England.
I11 those early days in New Zealand the Kea was not a common bird,
but with the new source of food supply it was simply amazing how their
numbers increased--and at the cost of the run-holder.
I remember about twenty years later being on a station where the
manager had just paid for the Kea heads killed during the year on the
station--and there were 600 of them at half-a-crown a piece--and I make
bold to state that say thirty years previously there had not been six couple
of these birds on that property, if as many.
John Bathgate.
THE STARLING.
There have latety been some serious complaints made by sheep-owners against the
Starling, on account of the habit it has of plucking out the wool of sheep. At the Ballarat
Show I met with a good many sheep-owners, and I made inquiries into the matter. To my
surprise I found that those who favoured the bird and those who were decidedly opposed
to it were about equally divided. Mr. Frank Austen, of Avalon, stated that 011 his property
the Starlings were in immense numbers, and lie had not had the wool plucked from his
sheep. He said that about thirty sheep-breeders in his district lately gave evidence in this
matter, and not one made a definite charge against the bird of injuring the fleece of their
sheep, though a few were of the opinion that they might injure the wool, when in large
numbers, by their droppings, as they have a habit of riding on the sheep's back. On the
other hand, Mr. J. Mack, of Berry-bank, stated that, owing to the Starlings plucking wool
from the sheeps' backs, the fleeces were rendered unsightly and considerably injured. The
birds could not have been looking for ticks, as his sheep were quite free from them.
Several persons supported Mr. Mack iu his statement as to the injury done to the fleece by
Starlings.
That the Starling has taken to eating fruit iu Australia is abundantly proven ; the
complaints against it come from almost every quarter where the Starling lias become
established. If, in addition to fruit-eating the Starling has acquired the pernicious habit
of injuring the wool on the sheep&apos;s back, the feeling will grow strong that it must be got
rid of, which will now be a work of some difficulty. This will be a great pity, for the
Starlings' habit of eating insects has heretofore g&apos;ained for the bird the name of the
farmers' friend. I11 many places I have seen these birds in immense flocks, day after day,
busily engaged seeking their food iu the pastures, and I have not seen them injuring the
sheeps' fleece. However, if they have acquired this habit it is but natural that the flock-
owners will endeavour to destroy them. The pastoral industry has enemies enough
without adding to their number.

following reply has been sent to Mrs. Gorter.
It is a most interesting fact that a Java Sparrow should pair up with
a Goldfinch, as they are representatives of two supposed families--the
Ploceidce and Fringillidce, which differ in the relative length to its coverts of
the so-called bastard primary.
In the Ploceidce this tiny quill is longer than its coverts; and it is the
rule for the species to build cave-like nests : in the Fringillidce the quill is
quite as large, but it is shorter than its coverts; and it is the rule for the
species to build open cup-sliaped nests.
By all means put up the birds in a breeding-cage, and do your utmost
to breed from them. You had better grow some rape-seedlings, and supply
both these and egg-food for rearing the young, should any be hatched. Do
not forget the cuttle-bone. A. G. BuTr.ER.

Sir, --In the Avicultural Magazine for December 1S97, I pointed out
that, being unable to obtain paddy-rice for a pair of Pin-tailed Nonpareils
then in my possession, I had substituted oats with most satisfactory results.
From that time to the present I have never troubled to secure paddy-rice
for any birds which, in their wild state, feed largely upon it; for experience
has satisfied me that whole oats are greedily eaten by them all, and answer
every purpose equals well, if not better.
It is certain that what may be a natural food for a bird when at
liberty, is sometimes no better than poison to the same bird when in cap-
tivity. It is also true that what is one bird's meat is another bird's poison ;
so that if a man argue that a Canadian Grosbeak could not be poisoned by
mountain-ash berries, because his British Thrushes eat the same freely
without ill-effects, his opinion is of no value to any man of wider experience.

an epoch in aviculture --\0x25A0 in breeding one. In his work on " British
Central Africa" Sir Harry Johnstone states (p. 333) that he has reared from
the nest the young of two species, Turacus livingstoni and Gallirex chloro-

appear to be covered with a dark bluish grey down. Though rather

activity in the nest than the young of Pigeons. In this early stage the
hare-looking head is rather Parrot-like. The way these young birds
clamber about in almost a quadrupedal fashion, helping themselves some-
times with their unfeathered wings, reminded me of what I had read con-
cerning the young of Opisthocomus, though of course the habits were not
so strongly marked, and so far as I know the young of the Touracous have
not the fingers of the maims so strongly developed as in Opisthocomus.&apos; 1 &apos;&apos;
Sir Harry Johnstone likewise states that there are generally two or three
young birds, and that the natives say four are often hatched.
Although published in 1897, this account of the young of a particu-
larly interesting group seems to have been generally overlooked ; but I
noticed it some time back, and in an article I wrote 011 these birds in the
" P&apos;eathered World " for August 5th of last year I mentioned the downy
and partly active state of the young Touracou, though, being pressed with
work at the time, I forgot to say who was my authority for the statement.
I see Mr. Pycraft states that the Touracous are semi-zygodactyle,
by which I take it he means that the fourth or outer front toe may
be turned either backwards or forwards, or is at any rate not definitely
directed backwards. I had one of the above-mentioned Gallirex chloro-
chlamys under my charge for a mouth, it having been entrusted to me for
the Zoo. by the late General Mathews in Hast Africa, and I have often
observed other species at the Zoo. since. I find the outer toe is almost
invariably behind, although it is turned back in such a way as to look as if
unnaturally forced into that position. The web also between the third and
fourth toes seems to show that these birds were not so very long ago non-
zygodactyle, and in skins, in man} 7 cases at all events, the fourth toe comes
forward as in ordinary birds. Frank Finn.

PETERS&apos; SPOTTED FIREFINCH.
Lagonosticta niveiguttata.
A living specimen of this very beautiful finch was exhibited
by Mr. L,. W. Hawkins at a bird show at the Crystal Palace in
February 1903, as reported in the Aviculturcil Magazine (N.S.
Vol. I. p. 179) ; and the same example appeared at the Palace in
November and December of the same year ; this is, so far as I am
aware, the only living specimen of this species that has ever
been imported.
The living bird reminds one strongly of the genus Pytelia,
and it is probably quite as closely related to the members of this
genus as to the typical African Firefinches. Dr. Hopkinson,
who has studied the Firefinches closely, and knows several of
them well in a wild state, has pointed out in Bird Notes , that the
genus Lago?iosticta can well be divided into three groups, the
first "to include L. jiiveiguttata (and any close allies it may
have), which from its general appearance and habits is more
nearly related to the Aurora Finches {Pytelia) than its neighbours
in the [British Museum] Catalogue." The second group to
consist of " typical Firefinches, L. senegala , rubricata, rufopicta t
and allied species from various parts of Africa, which are all
alike in their food, habits, and requirements in captivity." And
the third group, " the Davender Punches, Vinaceous Firefinches,
etc., whose manners in captivity and whose habits in freedom
place them in a group by themselves, a group markedly distinct
from that which includes the typical Firefinches."
As the very beautiful L. niveiguttata has been imported

Mr. J. L. BonhoTE,
alive once at least, it is sincerely to be hoped that other speci-
mens may arrive in this country, and there seems to be no reason
why they should not.
According to the late Dr. Stark, the distribution of Peters'
Spotted Firefinch is as follows: " From Inhambane in Gazaland.
where according to Mr. H. F. Francis, it is not uncommon, to
the Zambesi (Kirk); Nyasaland (White) ; Malindi, the Usambara
hills and Zanzibar to East Africa (Kirk) ; extending to the
Great Lakes of Central Africa." It is said to frequent thick
undergrowth, and to be in the habit of searching amongst the
leaves on the ground, apparently for the seeds upon which it
chiefly subsists.
A coloured figure of this species appeared in the Proceed-
ings of the Zoological Society for 1S81, accompanying a paper by
Captain Shelley on some rare birds from East Africa ; but, as
comparatively few of our members have access to this figure, the

THE SMEW,
Mergus albellus.
By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
To the aviculturist the pleasure of having a new bird, or
one with which both he and his fellow-men are more or less
unfamiliar, is always an unmitigated delight. For some years
past I had wished to possess some of the Divers, or Saw-billed
Ducks, or failing them, some of the Grebes.
My first chance came about two years ago when I had
an opportunity of purchasing an exceedingly fine cock Smew.
But alas for human hopes ! In order to reach me he had to
undergo a long journey, made additionally tedious by delay on
the railway, and he arrived only to die within a few hours.
My next venture was with a Great-crested Grebe, a fine
looking bird in good condition, and I was assured that it was

well on its food. I purchased it, but two days later, having
refused all tit-bits, it died.
Again my chance came, and I was more than ever
determined to have and keep one of these birds ; this time it was
a splendid cock Merganser. I looked at him and felt him and
he seemed well and in good condition. Again I was assured that
he fed well, and by his appearance and actions I quite thought
that he had every chance of living. He reached my aviaries
safely. I sent special and voluminous instructions as to his care,
being away at the time ; but alas ! in two or three days he was
dead.
Possibly I ought now to have given up the attempt, but
'hope springs eternal in the human breast,' and feeling sure that
there ought to be a means of keeping these birds, whose diet is
comparatively simple and easily provided, in health, I determined
on seeing another fine cock Smew to try my luck once more.
The bird arrived safely last April, but refused food, and I
felt at once that another repetition of my previous ill attempts
was about to take place. I tried him with fish cut up in small
pieces and forced them down his throat but with little effect, for
he threw them up again. At last I tried whitebait, and gave him
one which he took and swallowed, and another and another. The
following day the same process was repeated, and to draw a long
story short I was able to gradually wean him from whitebait to
fish cut up small, and even to taking meal ; this last, however, was
not put in the aviary for him but for some Gulls ; nevertheless
he would occasionally eat some.
He was kept in one of my Duck pens, a place about 12ft.
square with a pond 8ft. square and a foot deep in the centre.
At first he was very shy, remaining bunched up in the
cover all day ; but eventually he became quite tame, coining up to
be fed, and taking the fish from our hands. His nature was very
sluggish, and he spent much of his time on land, entering the
water chiefly for the purpose of bathing. Although having
full use of his wings I never saw him fly or even attempt to rise
from the ground, where however he could walk fairly well, and
better than the true Diving Ducks. The only note I heard him
utter was a kind of guttural squeak.

Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
The adult plumage of the cock Smew is entirely white,
except for the mantle and quills which are jet black. The rump,
upper tail coverts, and tail are bluish grey, and the flanks are
delicately vermiculated with the same colour. Stretching half
way across the breast is a narrow black bar, and a shorter but
broader one starts a little farther back. The head, like the rest
of the body, is pure white, with the exception of a black patch
on either side extending from the base of the bill to the eye, and
another high up on the occiput divided from its fellow, with
which it really joins by the overlapping of the longer feathers of
the crown which form a small crest.
Towards the end of August my bird began to show signs
of assuming the eclipse plumage, and since, so far as I am
aware, this plumage has not hitherto been described, I watched it
with great interest.
In the eclipse plumage the crown of the head becomes of
dark chocolate colour as in the hen, while the sides of the head
become of a brighter and redder brown, shading off into
chocolate again behind the head. The black spot in front of the
eye still remains, although considerably shrunk in size, as do
also the two patches on the occiput. Owing, I presume, to mine
not having completed his change, an irregular line of white is
left from behind the eye to the occipital patch, and thence across
the head to join its fellow on the opposite side. The flanks,
instead of being vermiculated, are pure bluish grey, the colour
reaching as far as the anterior bar, and obliterating the posterior
one. A belt of the same colour extends across the chest. On
the back the mantle remains black , but the white scapulars are
replaced by new bluish grey feathers, f
The Smew has often been kept, but only for very short
periods, in the Zoological Gardens, and the only record relating
* T. have since found two descriptions, neither of which are correct ; the first in
Yarrell&apos;s British Birds, II. ed. ; the second in the Brit. Mus. Cat. of Birds.
t This is a careful description of my bird when it died. From a comparison of it with
several other skins there is little doubt that in the full eclipse plumage the head loses all
the white and also the two occipital patches, but traces of the dark spots at the base of the
bill are always to be found, both bars on the chest are entirely lost, but the mantle
apparently always remains black and forms the most easily distinguishable character by
which the adult cock in this plumage may be distinguished from the lien, and also from
cocks in their first year; these latter being often known as " Red-headed Smews."

to it in captivity that I have been able to find is in Yarrell's
British Birds, where it is stated that one lived for over two years
on the St. James's Park water. This would be about 1840. It
apparently assumed its eclipse plumage yearly about the 15th
June, and used to consort almost exclusively with a female
Golden-Eye. Crosses, I believe wild-bred, between these two
species have been recorded on several occasions, and have
formed the basis of at least three new species.*

This Society was known by the name of the "Ornitho-
logical Society of London," and its objects were limited to the
keeping of rare or foreign birds (and more especially water
birds) in confinement.
It was started in the year 1837, or thereabouts, and had
very shortly enrolled some 200 members, amongst whom were
the late Mr. Yarrell and the late Lord Lilford. It received the
sole privilege of using the waters of the Royal parks for keeping
waterfowl, and proceeded to plant them with aquatic plants and
shrubs to encourage the birds to settle and breed.
Beyond these bare facts, and that its first Secretary was
Mr. Harry Chester and the offices in Pall Mall, I have been able
to ascertain little or nothing about it. It apparently published
no notes of any kind either in a journal of its own or in the
other scientific periodicals of the time, and I should be extremely
grateful if any reader could oblige me with any further
information.
In its wild state the Smew inhabits the northern regions
of the Old World, migrating South to the Mediterranean, Asia
Minor, and India during the winter, at which season it may
sometimes be found in great numbers round our coasts and
even at some distance inland, but it is essentially a sea Duck
frequenting sheltered bays and estuaries.
No account of this bird however brief would be complete
without mention being made of the finding of its eggs which for
so long had baffled collectors, by the indefatigable exertions of
Newton. P.Z.S., i860, p. 336.

Mr. C. William Bekbe,
the late John Wolley. I cannot here enter into the story of his
attempts, of the doubt with which he received and examined
the first clutch, or finally of the successful termination of his
search. The story is however quoted in full, I think, from the
Ibis, in Yarrell's British Birds, and is well worth reading,
breathing as it does the spirit of that ardent and indefatigable
collector.
The eggs, when found, proved to be very much like those
of the Golden-Eye, and are laid in holes in trees or in boxes
placed by the Lapps for that purpose.
After about six months I lost my bird from causes which
might easily have been avoided : two pairs of small Gulls which
had been put into his aviary depriving him of much of his
fish. Returning at the beginning of October, after an absence
of several weeks, I soon saw that something was amiss, although
I had still hopes of saving his life. The moult, however, was
far advanced, and he had not sufficient strength to pull round.
Still let it not be said that he has lived and died in vain, for he
has added to our knowledge of his kind, and given me great
reason to hope that it may be possible to keep some of these
most interesting of birds well and happy although confined.

BIRDS.

Curator of Birds at the New York Zoological Park.

Society, t&gt;3&apos; the kind permission of the Author].
Even a superficial study of the psychology of birds com-
pels us to attribute to them a highly developed intellectual and
emotional life. A few examples maj^ make this more patent, and
I will mention only those which entail rather complex psychic
processes. Birds have remarkable memories. It is said a pigeon
will remember a person after many months, and a Bullfinch has
been known to recognize a voice after a }^ear's time. Birds often
dream, and frequently sing or chatter in their sleep. There are
few species of birds which do not show the emotions of love

and sympathy, and, what is a very rare trait among animals,
that sincerity of affection which causes many birds to mate for
life. Even in those species which pair for only a j^ear, one of
the two will sometimes pine and die with grief at the loss of its
mate.
Indeed, sympathy is the key-note in the growth of the
higher intellectual and social qualities which find their culmina-
tion in man, and Professor Shaler is right when he attributes to
birds a higher development of this emotion than to any other
creatures below man. Reptiles can be trained to know their
keeper, and an alligator will defend her buried eggs ; dogs are
unusually affectionate animals, and the higher monkeys have
many sympathetic habits and emotions, but birds lead them all.
This is not remarkable when we consider the wonderfully im-
portant place which the family holds in this class of vertebrates.
The building of the nest, the comparatively long incubation of
the eggs, and the patient feeding and complex education of the
young birds all are duties in which both parents often share. It
is this continued association, this " bridging over of generations,"
which has made sympathy so prominent a factor in the minds of
birds. In what other class of animals are vocal signals of fear,
distress, or terror so widely understood, or so willingly met with
efforts of assistance ?
To me it seems puerile to try to believe that a bird's
affection for her young, so great that she will often give her life
in their defence, can be correlated with an i?istinct, using that
word in the common acceptance of the term. It is no more an
instinct in the sense of an uncontrollable emotion than is the
analogous action of an heroic human being. Altruism, pure and
simple, has governed the action of more than one bird under my
observation during the past } ? ear, and that, too, in some instances,
between birds of different species. Three instances come to
mind : a female Red-winged Blackbird which carried a mouthful
of worms to a nestful of young Red-wings near by, before pass-
ing on to brood her own eggs, as yet unhatched ; a Boon which
voluntarily risked his life to free a Pied-billed Grebe from a
nearly fatal ice-trap ; and a great Crowned Pigeon which assumed
the care of and sheltered a nestling Ring-Dove deserted by its
parents.

Mr. C. William Beebe,
Another aspect of the mental processes of birds shows us
examples of revenge being taken after long and patient waiting
for a favourable opportunity, while on the other hand Crows
have been known again and again to sit in judgment upon one of
their number, and to sentence and punish it with death.
The language of birds is most complex, and all, from the
marvellous song of the Nightingale and the imitative powers of
the Mocking-bird, to the many moods and feelings reflected in
the apparently meaningless chirps of our city Sparrows, tell of
mental powers striving for expression.
In man the various emotions depend upon language and
the range of expression of the face for their outward demon-
stration, and it is interesting to compare with this the state of
affairs among birds. These creatures, handicapped by a vocal
language very inferior to our own, and faces, for the most part
sheathed, like those of insects, in expressionless masks of horn,
yet are able by movements of their feathers, limbs, and other
portions of the body, to express a wide range of emotions, and
to clearly communicate even delicate shades of meaning.
Interrupting, for a moment, the mention of these finer
qualities which show the high mental position of birds, it is
desirable to emphasize a factor common to all animals, but which
in birds is very important, and developed to a remarkable degree
--that of extreme individiiality . It is this plasticity or wide
variation on the already high level of knowledge or " platform of
determination," as Baldwin happily terms it, that gives to birds
the numerous chances for new accidental opfiorhinities, as we may
call them--stepping-stones on the road of deduction, to some
new and higher expression of psychic power. Every-day acci-
dents in the search for food may be instantly seized upon by the
quick perception of birds and turned to good account.
Birds had early learned to take clams or mussels in their
beaks or claws at low tide, and carry them out of the reach of
the water, so that at the death of the mollusk the relaxation of
the abductor muscle would permit the shell to spring open and
afford easy access to the inmate. Probably it needed only the
accidental dropping of a few shells on the hard rocks, and a
taste of the appetizing morsels within, to fix the habit which, by

imitation, has spread so widely among birds at the present day.
To how trivial an accident might the beginnings, the psychic
anlage, of many modern cosmopolitan traits of birds be traced
if we could but read the past clearly !
Play and courtship--while they go hand-in-hand, so to
speak--afford opportunity for the vast resources of variation to
be abundantly expressed. Gross, in his admirable " Spiele der
Thieve ," has given five separate classes under the head of court-

ship :
1. Eove-plays among young animals.
2. Courtship by arts of movement.
3. Courtship by display of unusual or beautiful colours
and forms.
4. Courtship by means of noises and tones.
5. Coquetry in the female.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997058608695652" page_id="32656607"  page_num="127" year="" vol="">
In the Zoological Park each spring, and indeed during
almost every month of the year, many examples of these court-
ships and plays can be observed. The dances of Cranes and
Eagles, the magnificent showing off of Pheasants and Ducks,
the screams of Parrots and all the songs vibrant with sentiment,
in which birds strive to outdo each other in the eyes of the
female, show how greatly the spirit of emulation and recognition
of their respective accomplishments inspire the suitors. We
should also realize how pronounced must be the discriminative
power and aesthetic appreciation of the females. The display of
the Peacock combines the classes of movement, colour, and
noise ; for the beauty of its argus-eyed feathers is made more
effective by their being raised in a halo above the bird, the
shivering of its wing-quills forming a castanet accompaniment.
A genuine delight is taken in these various displays. So
far from being intuitive or mechanical exercises they are con-
scientiously practiced for weeks beforehand, and are kept up
long after the period of courtship and nesting is over. For
instance, in the Zoological Park, when a Peacock in early spring
timidly erects his plumes before an appreciative Crow it is for
practice in anticipation of its later use in competition with his
rivals. After the period of courtship, when he struts back and
forth before a line of admiring people, the exercise is from pure

Mr. C. William Beebe,
delight and appreciation of his own beauties. The Germans, in
their finely discriminating language, express the delicate shade
of meaning in these acts by voriibung and ausiibung. Even in
birds which pair for life, I have noticed a coquetry and pretended
courtship, spring after spring.
One more interesting fact about courtship among birds--
another indication, perhaps, of their individuality--is that it is
not always the most highly decorated suitor, nor the one
victorious in combat, who wins the female for whom he is putting
forth his utmost efforts. I have seen a peahen show a very
decided preference for, and ultimately pair off with, a young bird
who had but small display, and was almost spurless. An
amusing instance also noticed in the Park was that of some
Mallard Ducks. Three drakes vied with each other for the
favour of a little brown duck. One of the drakes seemed to put
but faint hope in his splutterings and bowings, and little wonder,
for his tail feathers and the showy curl, one of the decorations
of his sex, had been shot away, and shot-scars had spoiled the
symmetry of other parts of his plumage. The other two were
large and beautiful birds, bred in the Park. The iridescent
emerald of their heads and necks, and their immaculate shining
collars, made them incomparably more conspicuous than the
smaller wild bird. Nevertheless, all their efforts were in vain,
while the occasional pitiful attempts of the handicapped suitor
to spread an imaginary tail and declare his everlasting devotion
prevailed. He was accepted, and the pair were inseparable
until the nest was finished and the duck began sitting on her
eleven eggs.
Turning from the birds in the collection to our wild native
birds which make the Park their home, or pay it frequent visits,
we find much of interest in their changed habits and dispositions.
The sight of so many birds flying unharmed in the flying cages
or walking about their ranges or swimming on the various
ponds undisturbed, although in close proximity to man, is
fraught with significance to the quick perceptions of wild birds,
large and small. Their keen perceptions and superior powers of
intelligence tell them that such unwonted altruistic conditions
must offer advantages.

The almost immediate recognition of their security in the
Park is remarkable, and birds which seldom show themselves
within sight of civilization have come again and again, and
exhibited a tameness which deceives many people into thinking
they must be escaped birds. The honoured visitation of Canada
Geese will long testify to the truth of this. Wild Sea-Gulls quite
often drop from their loose flocks passing overhead, and consort
for a few days with their wing-clipped kindred. When they
leave, the young gulls which have been hatched in the Park
usually accompany them, but return in a few hours to their
home and flock. Ducks, Herons, and Hawks show as quick a
realization of their immunity from danger in the Park.
Green Herons creep like feathered phantoms among the
branches of the trees overhanging the water, while Great Blue
and Black-crowned Night Herons, forgetting all shyness, clamber
over the arches of the big flying cage in broad daylight, and in
sight of hundreds of people, peering down at their brethren
inside and uttering envious quawks as they see the bountiful
repast of fish and shrimps prepared for those fortunate ones.
The treatment of the tame Crows raised from the nest by
their wild relations offers an interesting psychological study.
Casual notes of mine show that the condition of affairs is about
as follows : The tame individuals are a source of great concern
to their feral friends. That no gun will be turned against them
these wild birds well know, but such utter contempt as familiarity
with man has bred in the tame Crows--closely superintending
every important change of cages or birds, often alighting on the
very head or shoulders of the attendants--this the wild Crows,
viewing from a distance, seem to think is evidence of a dis-
ordered mind, and they forthwith use every wile, every stratagem
in their power, to entice the tame birds back to their ranks.
Often in summer when I arrive early in the Park I surprise
a company of them " having it out"--the tame bird surrounded
by a ring of his fellows, all talking at once, and giving him no
chance for argument. But they have their trouble for their pains,
for liis is a life of unnumbered daily meals, not to mention the
opportunities for stealing and hoarding sundry keys, knives, and
other bright plunder--the occupation dearest to a corvine heart.

Leptoptila chloroauchenia.
By Miss R. Alderson.
The story of the nesting of these rare doves, which have
bred with me for the first time this last summer, is much inter-
woven with the history of my Rufous Doves ( L . reichenbachi)
about which I wrote in the Magazine for July 1904.
As some members majr not have seen this account, I fear
I must retrace my steps a little, to make these notes clear.
Briefly then, I purchased a supposed pair of Rufous Doves in
September 1902, but the birds, though cock and hen, were
otherwise quite different, though both belonging to the genus
Leptoptila. The hen was a Rufous Dove, the cock a Solitary
Ground Dove. At the time I wrote I did not know what the
latter bird was, so for want of a better name, I called it the
" Green Dove" in my notes on the Rufous Doves.
Through the kindness of Mr. Newman and Mr. Finn, who
have been at great trouble to identify the doves (by comparing
my two living birds with the skins in the British Museum) the
unknown dove has been found to be the Solitary Ground Dove
of South America.
The following are quotations from Dr. Sclater's notes on
this dove:--"It appears to be nowhere very abundant, and
addicted to rather a solitary (presumably in pairs) sort of life,
though sometimes three or four birds may be seen together. It
spends a great deal of time on the ground, where it walks about
under the trees rather briskly, searching for seeds and berries.
The song is a single uninflected and rather melodious note,
which the bird repeats at short intervals, especially in the even-
ing during the warm season. Where the birds are abundant, the
wood, just before sunset, becomes vocal with their curious far-
sounding note, and as this evening song is heard as long as the
genial weather lasts, it is probably not related to the sexual
instinct. The nest is a simple platform; the eggs, two in
number and white, but more spherical in shape than those of
most other pigeons."
I have only heard of one importation of this dove since I

got my own birds. In this one case seven birds arrived in
England, but I do not know who eventually owned them.
Now, before going any further, I had better describe to
3 r ou what the Solitary Dove is like ; though I fear that to anyone
who does not love doves as I do, the bird would be considered at
first sight rather dull and plain-looking.
It must be remembered, however, that in most doves the
colouring is as quiet-looking as it is beautiful, and it is only after
long observation of these birds that the delicacy and harmony of
their plumage can be really appreciated and enjoyed.
The cock Solitary Dove, then, is of upstanding shape and
rounded build--about the size of a Bleeding-heart Pigeon. The
general colour is greyish ; the wings, tail, and back olive-brown ;
the long wing quill-feathers being of a darker shade. The outer
tail-feathers are tipped with white, but the white is not notice-
able unless looked at from below, or unless the tail is spread.
The breast, throat, cheeks and forehead are a lovely soft purple
tint, the sheen on the neck and back of the head are exquisite
green, like the green pearl in a shell. The under-parts are
white, the eyes bright orange, the bill horn-coloured and the feet
pink. Underneath the wings is a beautiful copper lining, but
this feature is common to many other doves. The hen Solitary
Dove is very like the cock, but rather smaller, slighter, and
lighter in colour. The green on the neck is not so prominent,
and the purple tint on the breast not so distinct.
I bought my hen for a few shillings as an odd unknown
bird. Her wings were very badly cut when she first came to me,
and for a long time she could not fly.
The pair of Solitary Doves and the odd Rufous Dove were
all three put together in the same aviary, but though two separate
nests were started at the same time, and eggs were laid, no young
ones were reared. However, I felt I had learnt this much : my
birds were evidently a cock and two liens.
Eater I procured a cock Rufous Dove (the old bird proving
a hen) and this pair, and a pair each of Bronzewings and Aurita
Doves, were all placed in the same aviary with the Solitary
Doves.
All four pairs agreed on the whole very well, and all at
one time were nesting together.

Miss R. Alderson,
The Solitary Doves nested in April, and sat very well.
Two fine young ones were hatched, but both died when
only a few days old. Just at this time the Rufous Doves had two
strong young ones just out of the nest, and the Solitary cock,
who seemed as if he must have something to love and care for,
used to help to feed these young birds and preen their feathers.
Soon after this the Solitaiy Doves started nesting again,
this time in the Rufous Doves' old nest (the latter having chosen
another site), and I used to watch the cock Solitary Dove sitting
with a baby Rufous Dove on each side of him, as pleased as
possible to have them by him. For some time the little Rufous
Doves kept returning to their old nursery, evidently encouraged
by their old friend's kind reception of them. This second nest
was started about May 20th. Two eggs were laid, both fertile,
but when the birds had sat for about thirteen days one egg un-
fortunately got broken. The other hatched into a fine young
bird, and as might have been expected, received the greatest care
and attention from its parents. I left home for a short time
when the young bird was a few days old, and on my return, after
about ten days' absence, found the young dove had left the nest.
It did not seem much to care to return to it, as the young Rufous
Doves had done, but found its way about the aviary in a most pre-
cocious manner, apparently quite able to look after its own
safety, and quickly got to fly quite well.
This dove was one of the strongest and most active young
ones I have ever bred, and, after a few weeks, was almost as
large as either of its parents.
The general colouring of the young one on leaving the
nest was very like that of the old birds, but it lacked the
purple tint on the breast, the sheen on the neck, and the orange
eyes.
In the young bird the head was greyish with light dun
forehead, and the back of the neck dark grey. The breast was
dun gre}^ shading into pure white on the under parts ; the back
dark dun ; the wings dark brown, with two bands of copper
across each (in a later nestling these bands were lacking, but the
wings were spotted with copper instead, perhaps this bird being
much weaker lacked enough feather to make a perfect line). I

have noticed these same lighter markings on the wings of young
White-fronted Doves (Z,. j&apos;amaicensis) but in both instances the
light marks quite disappeared when the birds were a few weeks
old.
The tail of the young Solitary Dove was olive-dun, with
the three outer feathers on each side tipped with white, and the
next two pairs with lighter tips.
The young bird was never sick or sorry, and is now a very
fine specimen, and has long ago assumed the adult colouring ; I
think by its shape it is a cock.
In July the Solitary Doves nested again, but failed to rear
any young : later still yet another nest was made and one young
hatched, but when still in the nest it began to fail, and one day
was found dead. This young bird was a very poor specimen,
though healthy enough when first hatched, but the days and
nights had begun to be very cold, and the little bird did not
thrive properly. I have no doubt that had it been in summer
the result would have been very different. Date hatched birds
never do well, and the parents seldom look after them so
thoroughly as in the case of the earlier broods.
It is as well to make a rule to allow no late nesting to start
after the middle of September. After that date the eggs should
be destroyed, and the nests cut down, and if that will not stop
the birds laying, the pairs should be separated. Remember that
nests started the end of September mean that the young ones
will leave the nest just as November comes in, and what chance
will they have then to grow properly ? It may to some seem
cruel to destroy the eggs, but it is worse to watch a young bird
dwindling away day by day until it dies. Further, I have often
noticed that directly a young bird begins to fail the parents take
against it. It seems a law amongst birds that all that is weak
should not be allowed to live and is better out of the way.
I find most neglected young doves die from the same
complaint. The symptoms are lameness in one or both legs, the
bird becomes very relaxed, and gets thinner and thinner, until
at last it dies from weakness. Young Californian Quails are
sometimes affected in the same way, but in their case there is a
peculiar look about the eyes, that of itself is a warning that the
bird is going wrong.

Mr. W. E. Renaut,
I have found the Solitary Doves very hardy and easy to
keep, and very amiable towards others of their tribe, a great
point where one cannot give a separate aviary to each pair of
birds.

By W. E. Renaut, M.B.O.U.
It has been my wish for some time to reproduce in the
pages of our Magazine a record of my work in depicting, in situ,
the nests and eggs of some of our commoner British birds ; but
the Editor tells me that my pictures must be accompanied by
some descriptive matter. To narrate the tale of my wanderings
in search of subjects for the camera among the haunts of some
of our Southern birds in readable form is, to me, a work far
more difficult than the making of the pictures themselves.
Gladly would I yield my task to abler hands ; but as I am not to
be excused, I must beg my fellow members' indulgence.
To those who, like myself, revel in the study of bird-life--
be it over hill, through dale, by winding river or marshy pool,
forest and copse, over wild moorland waste, or by the side of the
silver sea--it is hard to find a more enjoyable way of spending a day
than in close observation of the interesting habits and engaging
ways of our feathered friends. I am never so happy as when I
set out at sunrise in all the glory of a Spring morning, armed
with a good field-glass, and a camera ; prepared for an all-day
tramp, with just enough sustenance for the inner man to
keep one going until sunset, and, above all, water-tight boots
and old clothes ; for dews lay heavy, and bramble and tangled
thicket have to be reckoned with.
One of the first birds to greet the day is the Song Thrush
(Turdus musicus), pouring out his joyous notes front some coin
of vantage, seeming to challenge the whole avian concert--a
challenge readily answered by all within hearing. A nest of this
species which I photographed last year (but which unfortunately
turned out badly) was in a most unusual site, being placed on

the ground in a field of growing clover, at some thirty or forty
yards from the nearest hedge. This nest would undoubtedly have
remained undiscovered but for the fact that some cattle had
broken into the field, and in driving them out I flushed the
bird.
The Mistle-Thrush f Turdus viscivorusj, another but less
common member of this musically-gifted family, is also, like
the foregoing species, an early breeder, the nest often being
built, the eggs laid, and sometimes the young hatched before the
trees and hedgerows have burst into leaf. I have frequently
noted the partiality these species have for the tangled thorns of
some old dell--some disused gravel or chalk pit of days gone by
--in which to build their nests. One in such a position, which
I photographed last Spring, contained five, instead of the usual
four, eggs. On showing the photograph to a well-known writer
on British birds, he questioned its genuineness, suggesting that
the fifth egg had been placed there by some mischievous boys.
Unfortunately, from what I know of the average country boy, he
is far more likely to take and destroy the eggs from a nest
than add others to them. Still, though my friend stands by his
assertion that the Mistle-Thrush, to use his own words, " Bays
four eggs, never more, and rarely less," I found yet another
clutch of five within a hundred yards of the first-mentioned
nest, both nests being on private ground. Moreover, I have the
assurance of several friends that they have had similar
experience. *
The Lapwing f Vanellus vulgarisJ, the commonest member
of the Plover tribe occurring in these islands, with his smart
dress, has always been a favourite of mine. His plaintive cry is
to be heard day and night when his breeding grounds are invaded.
Equally characteristic are his wonderful aerial evolutions, and the
plainly audible whirr of his broad black wings as he swoops
past one again and again, while his mate meantime has slipped
quietly away from her treasures, to join him directly in
demonstrative but infinitely picturesque behaviour with the
object of luring the intruder from their nest. My efforts to rear
this bird have not, so far, been very successful. In the Spring of

last year I put four Lapwing eggs under a small Bantam. All of
them were successfully hatched. The young birds were placed
in a coop, with a large wire run, in a field where some hundreds of
young Pheasants were being reared, receiving the same food
with the addition of a liberal supply of earth- and meal-worms;
but they all four gradually weakened, and died within a few days.
This species also provided me with another example of an
abnormal clutch--five eggs in one nest. It is well known that
members of the order Limicolce, with but few exceptions, lay
four eggs. The nest in question was unusually long, and
the five eggs it contained were of a very uniform type. Of
course, there is always the chance that where birds breed in
colonies, or where nesting sites are exceptionally inviting, one
may find birds of both the same and distinct species laying
together. A nest--if one may so describe a slight depression in
shingle--in a colony of Lesser Terns ( Sterna mimitd), which I
visited, contained five eggs of two such totally distinct types
that the merest tyro could have separated them into their
respective clutches. I know, too, of a case where a Common
Snipe ( Gallinago ccelestis ) and a Redshank {Totanus calidris)
selected the same nesting site, and actually deposited each their
full complement of eggs. I very much doubt if either of these
birds could have successfully covered the eight eggs, notwith-
standing their known skill in arranging them. Again, in places
where old and hollow timber abounds, one may constantly find
the Jackdaw ( Corvus moned 7 da) and Stock-Dove ( Columba cenas~) r
and Jackdaw and Starling (Sturmis vulgaris) selecting the same
quarters ; and I have even found a family of Bats sleeping the
day away just above a brooding Daw.
The illustration (Fig. 1) of the nest and five eggs of the
Blackcap ( Sylvia atricapilla) is in a very typical situation,
amongst the bramble undergrowth of a Pheasant covert, within
a stone's throw of the keeper's cottage. When I first discovered
this nest the male bird was sitting on four eggs, and, as they
appeared quite fresh, I decided to wait a day or two before taking
a photograph. O11 visiting the nest again two days later, I found
the female bird sitting on five eggs. That the male bird should
start sitting before all the eggs were laid is surely curious?

The Chiffcliaff (. Phylloscopus rufus ) is another of our small
Summer migrants who favours such a nesting place as that
chosen by the last-named bird. He is one of our earliest
visitors, and one of the commonest of the Warblers ; ye.t how
few nests of this bird one conies across in proportion to the
number of the species to be heard on all sides uttering their
monotonous monosyllabic note throughout the day! I fear,
however, that these notes of mine are being strained to such a
length that they will be even less acceptable to my fellow
members. I will therefore end them with a few words respecting
my illustration (Fig. 2) of the eggs of the Nightjar ( Caprimulgus
europoeus). This photograph was obtained in a clearing in a
small copse on some high ground in North Hants. This bird,
with its protective colouring, soft owl-like flight, and curious
jarring note, which is heard repeatedly at dusk, is a most elusive
quest, as I have often proved, when, seeming to hear his notes
quite near me, I have spent the best part of an evening in vainly
trying to get a sight of their producer.
THE SILKY COW-BIRD.
Molothrus bonariensis.
By W. T. Page, F.Z.S.
This species is also known as the Silky Cow-Bunting, but
it is closely related to the Meadow-Starlings, and has nothing in
common with the Buntings ; it resembles the Cuckoos in their
parasitical habits, but differs from our Cuckoo, in that it lays
several eggs in the same nest, and after doing so sometimes
smashes and devours the whole. Its Starling characteristics are
readily noticed, even without very close observation, as they are so
striking ; in a moderate sized aviary, their method of progression
on the ground, flight, clinging to holes in walls, method of enter-
ing a log nest, or closed nest box with only hole for entrance, is
almost identical with that of our Starling, and while their song
is not the same, their notes have much the same screechy
character, and do not possess, as far as my observations go, one
single characteristic that may be described as Bunting-like.

Mr. W. T. Page,
These birds are indigenous to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Patagonia and Uruguay: where, as already indicated, they lay
their eggs in the nests of other birds, and in my aviary the hen
has searched again and again, evidently for this purpose, every
closed nest box or log in the aviary. According to Mr. Hudson
the eggs vary much in colour: the greater number being pure
white, others faintly speckled with greyish pink when closely
examined; another fairly common variety being white, thickly
and closely spotted (or spotted and blotched, for some spots or
blotches are nearly J-incli an d irregular in shape) with red,
while a very rare variety is rich red entirely unspotted ; there are
almost an unlimited number of other varieties varying between
those described; I have seen three specimens which are almost
identical with those above described.
The male is 7J inches from tip of beak to end of tail, and
is glossy blue-black in colour, changing according to the way
the light catches it, to bronze-green, and purplish-bronze on
the head, neck, breast, back and shoulders ; the other parts being
dead black, which is also the colour of the beak and feet ; iris
brown.
The female is several shades of umber-brown, lighter on
the under parts, where it is almost greyish ; the greater part of
the wings (z. e. excepting the shoulders) are rich rufous; tail
blackish; beak and feet black; iris brown. The pair I am
describing I obtained from our member Mr. Housden, which
were I believe privately imported by him September 1903, coming
into my possession on December 29th. The weather was cold
and frosty, followed, for nearly two months, by cold, wet, damp,
or foggy weather, with only an occasional bright day. I had no
indoor accommodation, so I had to turn them out at once into
my outdoor aviary, which has no shed, its only shelter being the
gable of the roof, yet the birds did well, though they only got
seed for some months, and were in perfect trim right up to end
of April, the female right through ailing nothing at all ; but in
May the male was troubled with some throat affection ; this was
followed by a swelling, causing a bare patch, from which there
grew a substance (cheesy matter), #-inch diameter, and as large
and round as an ordinary marble, standing out from the throat,

only united by about a #-inch portion of tlie globular substance,
this broke away, at least three times, reforming to full size in
about seven days ; at end of July it disappeared altogether, and
the bird is now in perfect fettle again and a handsome fellow.
The only medicine I gave was a little salts occasionally in the
drinking water, but I gave plenty of nourishing food : liberal
supplies of egg, mealworms, and fruit, with dandelion leaves and
flowers as green food. While ill he did not seem to suffer, but
continued his song, though less vigorously while the trouble
lasted. They were through the moult and in perfect condition
by September 3rd.*
Both male and female sing, the female if anything most
continuously, and her song has more compass than that of the
male.
Dr. Butler says in " Foreign Bird Keeping" : " The Silky
Cow-Bird is not a pleasant aviary^ pet, for although not aggressive,
extremely easy to keep, and very long lived, it never becomes
tame, but, after years of association with its owner, remains as
wild and nervous, if he approaches the aviary, as when first
turned out; even in a cage it can never be called a confiding
bird." For the first few months my experience exactly tallied
with the above; there was really no pleasure in their possession,
handsome though they were, they dashed about so when anyone
was near the aviary, that they could only be observed from a
distance; and I regretted their purchase, and contemplated
giving them their liberty. But in June last, when our esteemed
member Mr. F. W. Harper was leaving England for South
America, he kindly gave me a male Indian Grey-winged Ouzel,
which he had hand-reared, and which had been on deposit at the
Zoo. for some months ; this was very tame, and would take fruit,
insects, in fact anything eatable, from my fingers. Hitherto I
had fed the Cow-Birds only on seed, but when I began to give
mealworms to the Ouzel, I found them so keen on obtaining
them that, when I appeared with the can containing them, they
began to tolerate my presence, and soon they would come and
take their share (though in a somewhat startled manner) while I

stood looking on ; now they are gradually losing their fear
and nervousness, are much more interesting, and I should be
sorry to lose them : at the same time I am bound to confess they
will not tolerate strangers, darting off at once to the darkest
corner of the aviary, or dashing wildly about.
The female is full of life and vivacity, her caudal append-
age being a very fair example of perpetual motion on the ground ;
it is mostly jerked up and down, but after a short flight, when
she alights on the branches, it is mostly jerked from side to side,
the feathers being spread slightly fanwise.
In the male I have only noticed the tail jerked up and
down ; his song when making love is loud and shrill, the notes
being very rapidly repeated ; at the same time he swells himself
out, causing the feathers round the neck to stand out almost
straight, drops his wing to the ground, expands the tail feathers
fanwise, drags these and the wings along the ground, and booms
rather than sings several of his notes while doing so, then takes
flight the length of the aviary away from the female, after which
he circles round her, at times appearing to hover in front of her,
uttering his notes incessantly the while, then to the ground and
the whole process is repeated again and again.
About two months before the male got over his trouble, the
female commenced bullying him, to such an extent that I feared
she would kill him, pulling out the feathers from the lores and
stripping off those from the forehead, he screaming piteously the
while ; my people named them Mr. and Mrs. Heupeck. After
about a month of this bickering, they patched up their differ-
ences, and began courting again. Shortly after I found she had
built a nest (I saw her finishing it, the male supplying material
and looking on) in a large log provided for my Cockateels, put-
ting in for a foundation small tufts of grass with earth attached,
arranging on the top of this a loose structure of small sticks and
bents similar to that of our Starling ; no eggs were laid.
In their native wilds they are gregarious, quite a number
will frequently be seen perched on the back of a cow or horse ;
as the animal grazes, they follow closely and snap up the insects
exposed; they also follow the plough in the spring for the
same purpose.

<bodyText confidence="0.94405375" page_id="32656623"  page_num="141" year="" vol="">
The Forty-sixth Annual Great National Show of Cage Birds was held
from January the 13th to 17th, and the Managers are to be congratulated
on a very interesting exhibition. Probably next year's show will be better
still, for we understand that in the future the "Great National " is to be the
only show held during the year at the Crystal Palace, whereas for some
years past there have been no less than three shows held each winter,
sometimes within a few weeks of one another, with the result that all have
been poor.
The class for hybrids between two British birds was an interesting
one, the most notable exhibits being three Bramblefinch-Chaffinch hybrids;
while the bird catalogued as a Lark-Yellowhammer was nothing more
curious than a Lapland Bunting, several specimens of which have been
taken recently on our East Coast.
A magnificent Waxwing, two Wrynecks, a Grasshopper Warbler, a
Pied Flycatcher, Green and Greater-spotted Woodpeckers, a Tree-creeper
and many other interesting birds were amongst the British exhibits, and
many of them bore ample testimony to the skill of their owners in keeping
the more difficult "softbills."
But the foreign species probably appeal most to the readers of this
Magazine. In the class for Parrakeets Miss C. Rosa Little obtained the
first prize with a Varied Lorikeet (Ptilosclera versicolor), Mr. I,. W.
Hawkins came second with a Tui ( Brotogerys ini). Barnard's, Bauer's,
Kings and Crimson-wings were also on view, as well as a hybrid Redrump-
Rosella which was disqualified, a course which seemed rather hard con-
sidering that there was no class provided for foreign hybrids and that these
add considerable attraction to the exhibition.
Mr. C. A. Edward's now well known Black Cockatoo was conspicuous
in her class. In the class for Waxbills, Grassfinches etc. Mr. H. E. Peir's
Yellow-rumped Finch ( Muniaflaviprymna) received the first prize and the
special for the rarest bird in the show. Mr. L. W. Hawkins showed a cock
Red-faced Finch (Zonogastris me/ba), Mr. Percy Peir a pair of Bathilda
rnficauda, Mr. Picard a very steady pair of Parrot Finches, and Mr.
Osbaldeston a fine cock Crimson Finch [Neochmiaphaeton).
Two Japanese Hawfinches were shown in the class for the True
Finches and Buntings, as well as both Cuba and Olive Finches and
Cardinals of four species.

The Insectivorous and Fruit-eating birds formed the most interesting
part of the show. Mr. Townsend's beautiful Black - backed Tanager
(Calliste melanonota) received the first and a special prize. The same
exhibitor, who generally has a magnificent display in this class, showed a
Tricolour Tanager, a Blue-winged Green Bulbul, and a hen Dacnis cayana.
A male of the latter species exhibited by Mr. L. W. Hawkins has developed
whitish primaries in his old age. Mr. Hawkins sent a pair of Crowned
Tauagers ( Tachyphonus coroncitus) which are distinctly rare. Mr. C. Cooper
showed a Hanguest {Icterus tibialis) which w'as entered in the catalogue
as a " Black and Gold Tanager," and the Judge failed to notice that it was
in the wrong class.
In the class for any species not eligible elsewhere there was an
interesting assortment. A White - throated Ground - Thrush {Geocichla
cyanonotus),* a species we do not remember to have seen before at the
Palace, was exhibited by Mr. Hawkins, and received the first prize. A
Green-billed Toucan received the second prize. There were two very
beautiful Purple-headed Glossy Starlings, a pair of Green Glossy Starlings,
a very perfect. Andaman Starling which failed to get more than a V.H.C.
card, and one or two other less interesting birds.

In Volume VIII. of the old series we gave a short notice
of the first edition of this little book, and it speaks well for it
that a second edition has already been called for. The new
edition is illustrated by a number of well drawn line blocks
by Mr. Goodchild, mostly from living birds in the Zoological
Society's Gardens. The chapters have been re-arranged so as
to bring the birds dealt with into the order adopted in the
Fa 7 ina of British India.
The book (which can be obtained from Mr. R. H. Porter,
7, Princes Street, Cavendish Square, W.) contains twenty-four
chapters, and is very brightly and interestingly written ; and,
although intended primarily for the Europeans in Calcutta, will
be much appreciated by English aviculturists, many of the birds
dealt with being often kept in captivity over here.

VARIATIONS IN GOLD AND SILVER PHEASANTS.

Sir,-- There is an interesting article in the January issue of the
Avicuttiiral Magazine respecting the variations in the plumage of Golden
and Silver Pheasants. Is it very unusual for the hen to assume the
entire plumage of the male bird ? Some thirteen years ago three little
Golden Pheasant chicks, a few days old, were given me. The mother had
deserted them and they were suffering badly from cramp. With the
assistance of a tame Bantam hen I successfully reared them. They turned
out to be one cock and two hens. One of the hens died about two years
ago in her ordinary brown attire; the other (which from the first had a
slight golden tint on the head) at the next moult was adorned with the
beautiful silky golden crest of her mate and a few yellow feathers in her
brown neck; when she moulted again the breast and lower part of the
back became } T ellow, and at this last moult, the yellow breast was streaked
with scarlet, the collar a very deep orange, barred with black, the mantle
on the shoulders a metallic green, and the wings a beautiful steely blue,
baried with wavy lines of brown. The crest long, silky, and brighter gold
than the cock's, and the same scarlet feathers in the tail as he has. The
bird was a great pet and exceedingly tame; she was taken ill on Xmas
Day and died the following morning. I am having her preserved as a
curiosity. We thought her more beautiful than the cock, her deep orange

collar and golden breast being the only distinguishing mark. Had she
lived over another moult, I believe the breast would also have become
scarlet. I am aware that a very old lieu past breeding will sometimes begin
to crow and assume the spurs and hackles of the cock, having had instances
in my own poultry 7 yard, but have never seen such a perfect example of
total change of plumage as this. I/. Sturton Johnson.
The following reply has been sent to Dies. Sturton Johnson:
It is not unusual for hen Gold Pheasants to assume almost entire
cock's plumage, but your account is especially valuable as giving a record
of the process in the case you observed.
vSince writing the article you so kindly refer to, I notice that one of
the hens in the Zoological Gardens, though otherwise normal, has the two-
centre tail-feathers mottled as in a cock, not widely barred as they should
be for her sex.
Did your hen retain the dark eyes ? This seems to be, sometimes at
all events, the case when this change of plumage occurs. F. Finn.
[It would be interesting to know whether Mrs. Sturton Johnson's hen
Golden Pheasant continued to produce fertile eggs after she had com-
menced to assume the male plumage, or whether, as is generally the case,
the assumption of the male attire was a sign of barrenness.-- Ed.]

THE FOOD OF PARROTS.

<bodyText confidence="0.998785727272727" page_id="32656626"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Mrs. Sopp's account of her caged Rosella and Mr. Bathgate&apos;s
letter about slieep-killing Keas give rise to some reflections. The Rosella
loved fat beyond anything: the Keas multiplied enormously after taking to
animal food.
A case was also once recorded in the Magazine of an Eclectus that
would kill and greedily eat a mouse, if one happened to stray 7 into its cage.
I called attention once before to a remark in Mr. Setli-Smitli's
valuable work, Parrakeels, that one kind lives partly on insects.
Now any 7 one who has kept many Parrots will have come across cases
of, not feather plucking , but feather eating. The bird is bare enough of
feathers (the down is left) but you don't find any feathers in the bottom of
the cage.
Neither Rosella nor Eclectus were the worse for their animal food:
the Keas thrive on it.
One hesitates to suggest animal food : it might be so easily overdone.
But it might be worth while trying with feather-eaters. And certainly in
their case it could do no harm, for I have never known them to live very
long. F. G. Dutton.
[It is remarkable how many Parrots one meets with which are fed on
a little of everything that conies to the table, and which evidently 7 thrive on
this diet, for they 7 are generally in fine condition, and often old birds which
have been family pets for a great number of years. The Parrots in the

Canal-bank aviary at the Zoological Gardens partake freely of the meat
that is supplied to the Crows etc., and are none the worse for it. On the
other hand one meets with Parrots, fed strictly in the orthodox fashion,
which have developed the practically incurable habit of feather - eating.
We believe that the majority of cases of feather-eating in Parrots result
primarily from want of occupation, though doubtless over-stimulating food
is partly responsible in certain cases. Meat is probably bad for Parrots that
are allowed no more exercise than they can obtain in the ordinary Parrots'&amp;quot;
cage, but whether a little occasionally is bad for Parrots which are allowed
a fair amount of exercise seems to us very doubtful.-- Ed.].

RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Two Crossbh.es (Mr. Clias. Rothera). [The first bird died of meningitis
caused indirectly from the injury received at base of upper mandible.
The bone was necrosed, and the disease had extended to the membrane
on the inside of skull and to that covering the brain. The latter was
much inflamed. The second bird died of apoplexy].
Cock Bueefinch (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). Been in aviary since 1902 and has,
since that time, enjoyed good health until one morning was found dead.
[The bird died of apoplexy. I should be inclined to reduce the
quantity of hemp].
Diamond Sparrow (Mr. T. N. Wilson). [Your bird died of pneumonia.
It was unwise to turn it out again after recovery from first attack at
this time of the year. Many birds will husk the seed, as you mention,
and apparently have no appetite to swallow it. There was no affection
of oesophagus to prevent her doing so].
Cordon Bleu and Beue Robin (The Lady Dunleath). Cordon Blen
found dead. Was caged with a Bulbul, Scarlet Tauager etc. [The
Cordon Bleu died of concussion of brain, and I should be inclined to
suspect the Bulbul. Blue Robin died of apoplexy. These birds are
usually very tame. I once had some dozen pairs, and it was a sight not
easily forgotten when they would fly round one for mealworms. I
think too many mealworms are likely to produce this complaint].

Cock Barnard Parrakeet (The Rev. R. H. Wilmot). Found dead.
Kept with a lieu and cocks of Enpatrius and Rosa and Californian

Banded Goose (Mr. F. C. Thorpe). When unpacked it could not stand,
but after a while it did, but walked with difficulty. [There was an
extensive extravasation of blood over the back, evidently from a recent
injury].
ZOS&apos;I&apos;EROPS (Miss E. E. West). [Bird died of apoplexy. I regret I cannot
undertake to have skins preserved].
Cordon Breu (MissJ. Furneaux). [Apoplexy was cause of death].
Blue Grosbeak (Miss R. Alderson). [Apoplexy caused death].
Masked Finch (Mr. Teschemaker). No particular symptoms. Gradual
failure. [Tong standing disease of the liver. Died of heart failure
consequent on extreme debility. It was a lien].
Kingfisher (The Countess of Harewood). This bird is one of two or
three found dead at the edge of the lake. Very dense fogs had prevailed
for a whole week. [The bird died of starvation, owing possibly to
being unable to find sufficient food during the foggy weather].
Diamond Finch (Mr. W. Tomes). Was seen, apparently well, a short
time previously to beiug found dead on the floor of the aviary. [An
apoplectic fit caused death].
Turtre Dove (Mr. T. H. Newman). Had apparently been out of health
for some time, and lately its feathers had been falling out. Another is
very bare of feathers and appears to be getting worse. [I have quite
failed to detect any sign of parasites. I should certainly either isolate
or destroy the living bird, or if you care to send it on to me I will be
pleased to examine it and advise you. Please state the seeds you feed
on].
Bishop (Mr. B. Mason). [The bird was a cock. Acute pneumonia was the
cause of death. In future please give symptoms and full particulars].
Gourdian Finch (Mrs. Bromet). Found on the floor as if it could not
use its wings or legs. Was brought in, and appeared to be getting
better. Gave it sherry and water. [Your bird had a fit which caused
the paralysis, and a second extravasation of blood on the brain caused
death].
Sherdrake. [No letter or name of sender],
Meary RoSEERA. (Mr. H. Boughton Leigh). Kept in a cage and fed on
canary and hemp. Perfectly well one night, was found unable to move
next morning, and died in an hour. [Apoplexy was cause of death.
Am afraid confinement in a cage (want of exercise) and the liempseed
(which is very fattening) may have caused it],
Purpre-capped Lory (Captain W. F. Smithwick). [The body sent from
taxidermist was too decomposed for examination].

THE BLACK LORY.
Chalcopsittacus ater.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
Being the happy possessor of an example of this rare
Lory, the first, probably, that has ever reached this country
alive, I have been asked to write a few lines on my experience of
him in captivity.
Though by no means brilliantly coloured, Ater has
a decided and most uncommon beauty of his own. At
first sight he is nothing remarkable, being apparently a funereal
black all over, but when in the sunshine or in a bright light, it
can be seen he is really a deep purple or claret colour. The
tail, flight feathers, eyes, beak and feet are black, the rump and
lower back a brilliant shining blue, hardly discernable when
the wings are closed, the under tail-feathers are orange and red.
The adult bird has pointed feathers on the back of the neck,
not unlike the hackles of a cock. The importer, Mr. Walter
Goodfellow, was very proud of having imported him alive and
in good condition. During his journey from N. W. New
Guinea ( Ater&apos;s native place) to Singapore, his death was
repeatedly prophesied by the bird dealers he met; one old man
who had been in the trade for years, told him the bird would
never live. " They are never brought further than the Celebes
and Timor," and he added, "they eat greedily of what you
give at first, quickly tire of it and soon die."
The specimen is I believe a cock bird. When his feathers
were coming and were in pointed sheaths on the back and neck,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.991237105263158" page_id="32656642"  page_num="148" year="" vol="">
On the Black Lory.
I introduced one of my Black-capped Lories, thinking they
would make friends, and the Black Cap take the sheaths off
the feathers and improve Aters plumage. A ter appeared to
approve of the Black Cap's appearance through the wires of his
cage, but no sooner did I introduce him inside the cage than
Ater flew at him with great fury, much to poor Black Cap's
alarm, who rushed up my arm uttering shrill screams of surprise
and terror. Clearly Ater preferred to live alone.
This trait is not an uncommon one amongst single birds
brought up by hand. He will still, when I put my hand inside
his cage, flutter his wings and utter little squeaks of pleasure
much as any young bird will do when fed by the parent bird.
I give him sweetened milk sop and sweet water grapes.
This fruit he prefers to any other, and will eat them in large
numbers. Where the difficulty arrives in importing them I
cannot say. Mr. Goodfellow told me the natives feed them
principally on boiled rice, a diet which I find suits few birds.
He imported his Lories on Swiss milk and fruit and I
think his success proves that this is the most suitable food for
the majority of these birds.
[Through the kindness of Mrs. Johnstone I have had the
privilege of seeing her living example of this rare Lory. It is a
fine specimen, in excellent condition, and very tame. The skins
in the British Museum all look very dull compared with the
living bird, especially in the colour of the upper tail coverts and
rump which appear quite bright blue in life, but dull purplish
blue in the dried skin.
Dr. Mivart in his Monograph of the Loriidce writes : " This
most sombre of the whole family of the Lories is one of the
oldest known, having been described and figured by Sonnerat
in his account of his voyage to New Guinea, on which he set
out in June, 1771.
" It is said to be common in certain localities, flying
through the woods and frequenting the smaller branches and
branchlets of the trees. It seems frequently to approach human
habitations : hence it is often caught, when it is easily
domesticated and shows itself gentle and attractive."

By W. H. St. Ouintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I have found this delightful little bird subject to fits in a
cage ; but hardy, and quite satisfactory, in a cool aviary. Mine
share an aviary with some Waxwings. It has a covered wooden
shed at the back, and one side is boarded up. The other side
and the front are open. The roof in front of the shed is glazed,
to ensure a dry floor for the Pintailed Saudgrouse and Painted
Quails which are also kept here. For some reasons this is
undesirable (turf will not long keep fresh in summer), but on the
other hand it gives some protection against the Tawny Owls
which are sometimes troublesome at this particular aviary.
My birds have a small tin of maw-seed to themselves ;
and they take what ants' eggs and egg yolk they like from the
Waxwings' food pan.
For three consecutive seasons a female has nested; and
in 1903 she hatched young, but the latter soon died. Bast spring
her mate was killed through the wire netting by an Owl; and it
was some time before I could replace him, and then with a bird
which arrived in very light condition. However he soon picked
up and an old Missel-Thrush's nest fixed in a spruce-fir for the
Waxwings, was lined and adapted, and a clutch of eggs laid.
A single young bird left the nest (there were three at first,
but for fear of disturbing the Waxwings I dare not visit the nest
*often, and I do not know what became of the others). It was
clever at climbing about in the spruce branches, and often
returned to sit in the nest. For several days the parents continued
to brood and feed the young one, which had left the nest before the
flight feathers were full-grown. However it became able to flutter
a few feet, and I thought all was going prosperously, when un-
luckily a pair of Waxwings, which had lined another nest in a

swinging orchid-basket, changed their minds before the eggs
were laid, and the Tits took possession. I removed the attraction
but too late ; and before I had quite realized how far matters had
gone, first the hen, then the male, gave up feeding and brooding,
and after two days' partial neglect the little one w T as found stiff
and cold, though in good flesh.
I should have said that though the parents were kept well
supplied with chopped egg, and fresh ants' eggs ; the young ones
were fed mainly upon mealworms.
The only species of the Genus Panurus , the Bearded Tit
( P. biarmicus ) has for a long time puzzled systematic naturalists.
It has, I believe, been suggested that it shows some affinity to
the group of Waxbills ( Estrelda ). O11 the other hand the nest, if
deep, is open ; and the egg, instead of being colourless, is faintly
streaked and spotted. Neither are the quaint antics played by
some of the male Waxbills while courting their mates (such as
presenting a grass-bent held like a pipe in the beak, at the same
time singing and displaying the plumage) to be observed in the
case of the bird under notice. There is one action of the Bearded
Tit which is quite to me unlike that of any other Passerine bird
that I have watched. The bird runs with rapid jerks upon the,
ground and scratches amongst sand or loose soil. It makes a little
jump forwards, and scuffles with both feet almost simultaneously,
making the sand fly. The object evidently is to uncover morsels
of food, and I see my birds doing this underneath the food
dishes which are mounted up off the ground. I have never been
able to get my Bearded Tits to notice seeds of reeds, though they
have often been supplied with bundles of reeds in the autumn.
The male takes his turn upon the eggs during incubation.

THE DURATION OF THE PERIOD OF INCUBATION.

<bodyText confidence="0.969684425" page_id="32656645"  page_num="151" year="" vol="">
By Arthur G. Butter, Ph.D., F.L.S., F.Z.S., etc.
The study of this branch of ornithology has, hitherto,
hardly been touched in the various faunistic works in which the
life-histories of birds have appeared: in the United States alone
does any serious effort seem to have been made to put on record
the various periods for which the birds of that country incubate.*
In the British Isles, excepting perhaps in the case of Game-
birds, and others which are conspicuously brought under man's
notice by domestication or other causes, next to nothing appears
to be known of this important item of avian life.f
Of course the explanation of this apparent neglect, in a
country which has amassed some of the finest collections of eggs
in the world, is evident enough: an ardent collector of eggs or
nests naturally secures his prizes while they are fresh, putting
off the study of the duration of incubation to a more convenient
season ; and having secured the clutches of a species which he
requires, promptly forgets all about the unknown, and therefore
more interesting, item.
If only to discover whether the longevity of birds bears a
similar relation to the period of incubation, to that which the
longevity of mammals appears to bear to the period of gestation,
the study of this part of their life is of interest; but it must
also be remembered, that no man who neglects a single detail,
can claim to have a thorough knowledge of the nidification of
any one species. To the aviculturist, who desires to be prepared
for the hatching of his broods, it is of considerable importance to
know when to expect this event.
In order to induce aviculturists and others interested in
* See Charles Beudire's "Life Histories of North American Birds."
+ After the present paper had gone to press Mr. Charles Chubb of the Nat. Hist.
Museum, who is a perfect walking Encyclopedia of Ornithological literature, called my
attention to two important papers on this subject, which I had unfortunately overlooked,
by Mr. William Evans, F.R.S.E., in *&apos; The Ibis" for 1891, pp. 52-93 and 1892, pp. 56-58.
They are most interesting as filling up many of the gaps in the present paper with respect
to British birds. Many of the results have been obtained by the use of an incubator; and
although great care has been taken to ascertain the correct temperature suitable for hatch-
ing the eggs, it may be anticipated that some of them will need revision. I11 some in-
stances also where the duration of incubation had been counted from the laying of the
first egg the statement of the observers will have (as Mr. Evans points out) to be accepted
with reservations.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
bird-life, to make notes as to the time occupied by our common
wild birds, as well as by the foreigners which nest in our
aviaries, in hatching their eggs ; I have thought it worth while
to collate the facts at my disposal, both with regard to those
groups of cage-birds respecting which little or nothing is yet
recorded, so far as I have been able to ascertain, and those about
which (chiefly through the agency of aviculturists) we have
definite records.
It seems hardly possible that the complete life-history of
such familiar wild birds as the British Thrushes ( Turdus) should
not be known : I feel satisfied that somewhere there must be a
record of the period of incubation of the Missel- and Song-
Thrushes, both of which have been bred in cages ; but hitherto
I have failed to discover it. I am under the impression, from my
own observations in bygone years, that it extends to thirteen or
fourteen days ; but alas ! I failed to write down the facts, and
memory unaided is sometimes unreliable.*
In 1891 Mr. J. E. Bertrand reared Blackbirds in captivity,
but he ignored the duration of the hatch, mentioning only that
the young left the nest when they were fifteen days old (Die
Gefiederte Welt, XX. p. 318).
Of the Wheatears, Chats, Warblers and Accentors I have
failed to find a record : an Accentor which built and laid in one
of my aviaries was unhappily unpaired, and consequently con-
tinued to sit until I removed her eggs : possibly some of the
volumes of the 'Gefiederte Welt' which I do not possess might
give us some light ; but even in Germany comparatively few
European birds have been bred in captivity.
I have no record of the Dippers, the true Tits, Nuthatches,
Wagtails (though possibly there may be a record of the breeding
of these with the requisite details, in some volume of the
Proceedings of the Zoological Society not in my library).! Pipits
bred in aviaries (Gefiederte Welt, XX. p. 352) seem to have
hatched in twelve days, but the published details are not
* Professor W. E. D. Scott says of the Migratory Thrush, that it " hatched eggs which had
been laid for some twelve days." This is a trifle vague. "13-15 days" (Evans.)
+ I think this doubtful; inasmuch as in the old days, if not now, the bare mention of the
fact--" Bred in the Gardens" was considered sufficient in most cases.

conclusive. Gould does not say liow long the Pied Grallina
sits.
I have discovered nothing about Chloropsis; and in the
case of the Jaj^-Thruslies and their allies breeding seems to be
difficult: a hen of Garrulax si?ie?isis belonging to Mr. Peter
Frank of Liverpool laid a white egg and brooded it for a time,
but afterwards devoured it. I suspect that the high feeding
formerly recommended for the species of Garmlax and allied
genera was responsible for this cannibalism ; Dr. Russ speaks of
feeding them like Thrushes or Starlings ; but he quotes Herr
Hmil Linden, as giving his Spectacle-Thrush (. Leucodioptron
canorum ) ants-eggs, carrot, whey-cheese, fresh or dried berries,
cooked grated meat and mealworms, varied by boiled rice ; and
Mr. Frank supplied his with snails, little fish, aphides, meal-
worms, etc.
It is a common error to overfeed partly predaceous birds
in captivity : my example of Garrulax picticollis has been in
perfect health for over five years; and, at the outside, he gets a
very little minced raw beef or a dead mouse once a week; other-
wise he lives upon my soft mixture, fruit, and a few cockroaches :
he eats a good deal of fruit.
Respecting the incubation of eggs by the Regent-bird,
the Orioles, Drongos, Wood-Swallows, Flycatchers, and true
Swallows, I have acquired no information, nor of the Honey-
eaters, and Sugar-birds. Messrs. Oesterlin of Mannheim bred
with Zosterops palpebrosus in 1884; one young one hatched, and
lived for eight days; but unhappily the breeder neglected his
opportunity, and said nothing about the duration of incubation.
Following the general order of the Zoological Society's
list, this will bring us to the Finches ; of which, with the Parrots
and Doves, probably the life-history is more complete than in
most other bird-families; therefore I will now retrace my steps
and enumerate species of the earlier groups respecting which
we have definite information, and afterwards pass on to the
Finches.
Of the Rock-Thrushes, Dr. Russ says that Monticola
cyanus sits fifteen days. Mr. Phillipps' Sliama appears to have
incubated her eggs for fourteen days (inclusively), the young

bird being hatched on the morning of the fifteenth day :
unfortunately Mr. Farrar omitted to tell us about his Dliyal-
bird. In the case of the American Blue-bird ( Sicilia sialis ) I
noted thirteen days as the period of incubation, and Dr. Russ
confirms this.
Dr. Russ says that the eggs of the Mocking-bird ( Mimus
polyglot tits&apos;) take from thirteen to fourteen days to hatch ; but Mr.
Farrar " at a rough guess " says eleven days, which is hurrying
up matters in a most unnatural manner 45 ; guessing in matters
which demand precision is always dangerous: he gives a similar
period to the Cat-bird.
Eggs of the Bearded Reedling, placed under a Canary by
Mr. J. R. Bonhote, hatched in thirteen days ; according to Russ,
the eggs of Liothrix luteus hatch in twelve days, but Mr.
Phillipps found that those of Mesia argentauris took thirteen,
the young appearing early on the fourteenth day.
The White-eared or Persian Bulbul ( Pycnonotus leucotis)
broods its eggs eleven days according to Herr August Wiener.
The Red-vented Bulbul was bred in the London Zoological
Gardens in 1890, and in those of Berlin the year following, but
as Dr. Russ does not state how long the eggs took to hatch, I
conclude that this point was overlooked in both instances. The
Chinese Bulbul (P. sinensis) went to nest in Dr. Russ' bird-room
in 1893 ; but both nest and eggs were destroyed by a Scaly Dove
squatting down on them.
Dr. Gunther's observation on the Red-backed Shrike
indicates the period of incubation as fifteen days ; and that
of Mr. St. Quintin on the Waxwing gives fourteen days for that
species.
The Scarlet Tanager bred by Princess Croy in Belgium
incubated for thirteen days; yet oddly enough Dr. Russ states
that Tanagers take twelve days to sit. Frau von Proscheck of
Vienna had a pair of Violet Tanagers which built a nest, but
without result; so that Dr. Russ could hardly have been
influenced by that.
* Incubation may be extended, but hardly shortened by two to three days, excepting
perhaps in unusually warm weather. One of my Canaries laid a double-yolked egg which
took seventeen (instead of thirteen) days to hatch.

on the Duration of the Period of Incubation. 155
In the true Finches I have the following records:-- Carpo-
dacus erythrinus , twelve days (according to Dr. Russ). I believe
this is the case also with the European Bullfinch, as fresh eggs
which I placed under a Canary were certainly hatched the day
before her own produce. Mr. Meade-Waldo does not record the
duration of incubation in the Trumpeter Bullfinch.
From what Mr. Swailes says of his Twites, this species
must sit for thirteen da}^ like the English Linnet, and probably
the Redpoll, (I conclude that the Twite began to sit on the
evening of the 19th May, and the young began to hatch early on
the 2nd June, or during the preceding night). Siskins (as with
Goldfinches), from the ease with which they can be crossed with
the Canary, should occupy the same time; but Dr. Russ, who
bred Chrysomitris atcullata, omitted to record the period occupied
in hatching Serimis faviventris , icterus, and lezicopygius all agree
with the common Canary in sitting thirteen days, and the nearly
related Alario-fincli probably does the same ; in fact Mr. Fillmer
says that a hen in his possession " began to sit on the 7th of
July, and hatched on the 19th or 20th " (Avic. Mag. III. p. 109).f
The Saffron-finch (Sycalis flaveola ) takes fourteen days to
hatch according to Russ, frequently confirmed by myself. Mr.
W. T. Page proved in 1900 that the Chaffinch takes fourteen days
to incubate its eggs (Avic. Mag. VI. p. 9). In his account of the
Teydean Chaffinch Mr. Meade-Waldo omitted this detail; but it
is probable that all the species of Fringilla agree in this respect.
Passer arcuatus, according to Russ, broods its eggs fourteen
days: this is probably the case with all the typical Sparrows ;
but owing to the hap-hazard manner in which they go to nest
they evade observation, so that in the case of both our Editor
and Mrs. Howard Williams the appearance of the young birds
came as a pleasant surprise. I think it probable that the same
number of days would hold good also for the Rock-Sparrows ;
but, as my hens were unpaired, the incubation of infertile eggs
may have been unnaturally protracted.
* A note in the ' Gefiederte Welt ' XX. p. 500, states that C. spinus sat for thirteen days,
but failed to hatch.
t Capt. Shelley, however, gives eleven days to this species, and fourteen to Serinus
sulpkuratus in his "Birds of Africa."

Sper&apos;mopliila grisea (or more likely S. plumbea ) is said by
Russ to incubate twelve days ; he says the same of 6". albigularis,
so that this time is likely to be common to all the species.
Volatinia jacarini was bred by Herr Langheinz about 1890, but
he omitted the period of incubation in his account of any of
the broods. Coccothraustes was bred by Herr W. Hartwig in
Berlin, who recorded eleven days incubation for this large
Hawfinch ! I am afraid I neglected to make a written note at the
time when I bred our Greenfinch, though I know I fully
expected the young after thirteen days, and was satisfied to
see the parents feeding them on the morning of the fourteenth
day. The Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Hedymeles ludoviciana) takes
fourteen days, as also the Virginian Cardinal, the Grey Cardinals
of the genus Paroaria , and the Green Cardinal (Gubernatrix
cristatella) , the last-mentioned I confirmed in 1895.
According to Thomas Gentry, the Chipping Sparrow
(Spizella socialis) only takes ten days to hatch out; but Dr.
Russ considered this an error, and said it must surely take eleven
to twelve days ; as Junco hyemcilis takes twelve days ; none of
the species of Zonotrichia seem to have been bred, but it is
probable that their period will be the same. Respecting the
species of Emberiza I have no notes. Cyanospiza ciris incubates
for thirteen days * Dr. Russ seems not to have been quite sure
about Phonipara , for he gives it from eleven to fourteen days ;
from what Mr. W. D. Hawkins says (Avic. Mag. VII. p. 30), his
hen must have sat from July 12th to 26th, on wdiicli day one
young bird was hatched ; this would give fourteen clear days:
possibly the youngster may have been hatched, but not noticed
the day previously : Mr. Pliillipps records nearly twelve days
(Avic. Mag. VI. pp. 193-4).
Owing to the excitability of many of the small Weaving-
finches ( Ploceidcz ) it is not often easy to discoverf how soon they
begin to sit steadily, or when the young hatch; also their
tendency to retire frequently to their nests, before incubation

really begins, is perplexing: nevertheless, in a good many cases
the period of incubation has been ascertained. Neochmia
phaeton is said, by Dr. Russ, to incubate from eleven to twelve
days, PEgintha temporalis for thirteen days, Pytelia phcenicoptera
twelve days. Of the many other Waxbills which have been
bred, I can discoverno other information. For Erythrura prasina
Lieut. Hauth gives thirteen to fourteen days ; according to Mr.
Phillipps Poephila goiildice would seem to take quite fifteen days ;
I cannot find any other record but his, as to the period of
incubation, and that (being based upon hearing the young on
the 16th day) may perhaps be not altogether satisfactory: I
think the young may have been hatched a day earlier, but not
heat&apos;d. Poephila cincta takes only twelve days according to
Russ; but P. personata according to Mr. L- W. Hawkins (Avic.
Mag. VII. p. 32) " about sixteen days." Russ gives twelve days
for the Diamond-Sparrow ( Steganoplura guttata) and for Aina-
dina fasciata : this I found correct. Tceniopygia castanotis only
takes eleven days to hatch, and it is probable that the same is the
case with Stictoptera bichenovii. The Cherry Finch ( Aideviosyne
modesta) takes twelve days, Aidemosyne cantaus and malabarica
eleven days, Uroloncha striata and acuticauda twelve, Munia maja
twelve, and I have little doubt that this is true also of the Java-
Sparrow (M. oryzivora) of which I have bred a great number,
but never could be quite certain when incubation had com-
menced. Spermestes cuc 7 illata and bicolor take twelve days,
but S. ?ia?ia thirteen.
Of the Whydah-birds next to nothing is known : Hypo-
che 7 -a nitens incubates for twelve days. Steganura paradisea was
bred by Dr. Russ, but he discovered that his birds were breeding,
only some time alter the hatching of the young. Of the
Weavers, Pyromelana capensis takes fifteen days ; Mr. Phillipps'
misfortune with P. franciscana unhappily leaves us in the dark as
to that species (Avic. Mag. N. S. Vol. III. p. 92). Oiielea quelea
and erythrops sit for fourteen days, Fo 7 idia 7 ?iadagaseariensis and
Hypha 7 itor 7 iis 777 ela 7 iocephahis fifteen, Sitagra hiteola eleven, and
the P. baya group of Ploce 7 is fourteen days.

record in the case of the Bobolink, or the Red-breasted Marsh-
bird (of which, if Russ is correct, I have hitherto been the only
private owner) ; the Cow-birds, of course, do not incubate. I
cannot discover that the Military Troupials have ever been
bred. In Agelceus phoeniceus incubation lasts about two weeks
according to Charles Bendire ; Xanthocephalus icterocephahts also
" about fourteen days" ; Sturnella magna and its western type
\0x25BAS. negleda fifteen to sixteen days; Quiscalus versicolor "about
two weeks.Of the Hang-nests, the so-called Baltimore
Oriole {Icterus baltimore) incubates for fourteen days according to
both Bendire and Russ ; but the Orchard Hang-nest (/. spurius )
only incubates twelve days according to Bendire.
Only two or three of the Icterine Starlings having been
bred in captivity, Major Bendire's notes are the more valuable.
Of the Sturniue Starlings (in which the bastard primary is
exposed), aviculturists have done rather more breeding. Dr. Russ
and Herr Wiener say that Lamprocolius chalybeus was bred in our
gardens in 1872, but I can find no mention of it in the volume ot
the Proceedings for that year : L. auratus is said to have been
bred the year following. In neither case does Dr. Russ give any
details, so I conclude that none were published. Mr. Phillipps
says that with him Acridotheres cristatellus and tristis laid many
eggs and a few were hatched (Avic. Mag. Vol. IV. p. 137) but he
throws no light on the period of incubation : neither does Herr
Wiener, who bred A. cristatellus in 1875, and Poliopsar
malabaricus in 1877 and 1878. Mr. Farrar, who bred the latter
species in 1900, also omits to mention the incubation ; but, with
regard to P. andamancnsis he says,--" as far as I could tell, she
sat about thirteen days " and of Temenuchus pagodartcm, --" The
sitting lasted roughly some thirteen days." So, with regard to
the Sturnidce, we have no exact data in spite of the number of
species which have nested in captivity.
Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, the Satin Bower-bird, takes three
weeks according to Mrs. Johnstone (Avic. Mag. N. S., Vol. I. p.
64) incubation having commenced on June 7th, and food first
carried to the young 011 the 28th.
One would suppose that in such conspicuous birds as the
Sixteen days according&apos; to Dr. Russ.

on ihe Diiration of the Period of Incubation. 159
Crows, plenty of information respecting tlie duration of incu-
bation would be available for the information of bird-keepers,
yet even the late Lord Lilford, who bred the Raven in captivity,
appears to have overlooked the importance of this part of its
life-history:* As these birds do not lay regularly, observations
on the incubation of their eggs are doubtless not easily made ;
but from what Major Bendire says of the N. American species,
there can be no doubt that twenty-one days represent the general
period of hatching for the genus Corvus. Dr. Russ was unable
to give any information on this point.
Judging by what Major Bendire tells us of Clarke's
Nutcracker, the genus Nucifraga probably incubates for sixteen or
seventeen days. The Chinese Blue Magpi e (Cyanopotius) hatches
out in nineteen daj^s according to Dybowski (vide Russ, "FreindL
Weiclifutterfresser," p. 695) : this species was bred in our
Zoological Gardens in 1884 and 1888. In Pica incubation seems
to last from sixteen to eighteen days (Bendire, Life-histories of
N. Am. Birds, Vol. II. p. 354). The incubation of the species of
Perisoreus seems not to have been studied, and I can find no
notes as to Garrulus ; but Cyanocitta incubates about sixteen
days according to Major Bendire's records of the various species.
Respecting Urocissa, Cissa, Dendrocitta, and Ptilostovms I have
no notes. Lady Nevill's Choughs laid but did not sit well; so
that she was unable to give us information respecting the
incubation of that group of Crows.
Of the Crow-Shrikes and Piping Crows no species appears
hitherto to have brought up a family in captivity, though Baron
von Comely had a pair of pinioned Piping Crows which built
a large nest in the open at Tours; unfortunately both birds were
killed by a polecat before any eggs were laid : and Campbell in
his splendid work tells us nothing as to the incubation of
their eggs.
Of the Larks hardly anything has been recorded to throw
light upon the duration of the brood (' Brutdaiter ' as the Germans
tersely put it) : all we know is from Bendire's note on Otocorys
alpestris --"incubation, which lasts about fourteen days." In the

this point in the case of his Ravens.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Gefiederte Welt' for 1S91 Mr. H. Wiinn and Dr. Russ both
describe nests built and eggs laid by the Skylark in their bird-
rooms ; the first gentleman had two nests, but both were
destroyed by a Ouail, and Dr. Russ sent his as a curiosity to the
Berlin Museum. Mr. Phillipps records the nesting of Melano-
\0x25A0coryphayeltoniensis in his garden aviary in 1899, and tells us that
the hen began to sit with the first egg, but he gives us no
information as to when this egg was laid and when it was
hatched.
I have looked in vain for data as to the incubation of the
Pittas. Respecting the Tyrants Major Beudire tells us much,
but his notes chiefly deal with genera hitherto not imported as
cage-birds ; in the King-bird ( Tyrannus) lie tells us that
incubation lasts from twelve to thirteen days ; but of the
incubation of Milvulus tyrannus he unfortunately could not
write, the bird being only an occasional visitor to the United
States.
The Nightjar has been kept as a cage-bird in Germany:
its period of incubation is eighteen days according to Mr. J. H.
Gurney, Junr. In the Woodpeckers the period is usually
perhaps about fourteen days ; this is so in the case of the Greater
Spotted Woodpecker : in some of the species, the eggs not
being laid at regular intervals of twenty-four hours, it is
difficult to ascertain the period with certainty. Very little
information is available respecting Kingfishers; but Major
Bendire says that Ceryle alcyon sits about sixteen days. Probably
the only way to ascertain the period in the Hornbills would be
to hatch eggs of the various species in an incubator.
Of Bee-eaters and Rollers I can find no records ; nor does
anything seem to be known as to the incubation-period of
Toucans and Barbets, or even of Cuckoos ; but of the Touracous
Mrs. Johnstone gives us valuable information with her Phaser&apos;s
Touracous ( Turacus macrorhynchus) :--" Almost exactly three
weeks after the lieu commenced to sit, the first egg hatched"
(Avic. Mag. N. S., Vol. III. p. 28).
In the Parrots, owing to the irregularity with which their
eggs are laid, it requires considerable observation and judgment
to ascertain the length of time required to hatch them : coil-

sequently in many cases where a species has been bred, no record
of the period of incubation has been published. Comparing
Russ' records with those of other observers, I should be inclined
to think he sometimes over estimated the period : however, I
have notes of the following :--Swainson's Rorikeet, twenty-three
to twenty-six days (Russ) ; Coclcatiel, twenty-one days (Russ);
Illiger's Macaw, twenty-four days (Russ); Golden-crowned
Conure, twenty-six days (Russ) ; Passerine Parrotlet, apparently

twenty days (Farrar) ; Mealy Rosella, twenty-one days (C. P.

twenty-two to twenty-four days (Russ); Barnard's Parrakeet,
about three weeks (Mrs. Johnstone); Many-colour, about
eighteen days (cf. Seth-Smith in Appendix to 'Parrakeets'),
Blood-rump, twenty-two days (Russ); Bourke's Parrakeet, about

In the Columbce it is comparatively easy to note the
hatching of the eggs without risk of blundering; yet Dr. Russ,
speaking of the Doves as a whole, says that their period of
incubation lasts from fourteen to twenty days ; and he takes no
further trouble about the matter.
Miss Alderson says (Avic. Mag., VIII. p. 221) " sitting lasts
seventeen to nineteen days, in some cases possibly a little
I bred tlie latter in 1894 ; but, the Avicultural Society not being&apos; then in existence,

Dr. A. G. Butler,
longer": but of the many species this lady has bred, she gives
us no definite details respecting the hatching of their eggs,
which is most unfortunate. Mr. O. E. Cresswell has done so in
one instance. Altogether Mr. David Seth-Smith has paid more
attention to this point in the life-history than any other in our
country; he has also made it evident that cold weather retards
the hatching of these birds' eggs, and thereby possibly
is prejudicial to the vigour of the nestlings.
The following are the few facts which I have been able to
collate :--The genus Columba incubates from eighteen to twenty
days, eighteen days being the regular period for the British
species according to Tegetmeier, eighteen to twenty for the N.
American species according to Bendire, who also gives the same
period for Ectopistes migratorms, but about two weeks for
Zenaidura carolinensis , and about eighteen days for Melopelia
leucoptera. The Barbary Turtle sits from seventeen to eighteen
days, and I should think the Necklaced-dove does the same,
although (Avic. Mag. IV. p. 25) I put the time at nearly three
weeks. This year a young bird (71 tigrinus x T. risorius albus)
hatched on January 9th from an egg incubated since Dec. 22nd
of last year. 41
Geopclia cuneata incubates about twelve days according to
Seth-Smith (Avic. Mag. V. p. 35); and Scatdafella sqzcamosa pro-
bably fourteen days (cf. Avic. Mag. N. S., II. p. 271); Chamcepelict
passerina , two weeks according to Bendire; Tyzzipanistria
bicolor , seventeen to eighteen days (Butler, Avic. Mag. N. S. Vol.
II., p. 100); Phaps elegans , eighteen days in cold weather (Seth-
Smith, Avic. Mag. N. S. II. p. 212 ; fifteen days in warmer
weather t. c. p. 263); Ocyphaps lophotcs, about nineteen days
(O. E. Cresswell (Avic. Mag., III. p. 204).
Mr. St. Ouintin reared a specimen of Pterocles alchata in
1897 (cf. Avic. Mag. V. p. 73), but does not note the duration of
incubation ; in 1900 his Sandgrouse failed to hatch. In 1899
Mr. Meade-Waldo bred Pintailed Sandgrouse (Avic. Mag. VI. p.
77) but gave no particulars as to the incubation ; nor did he again
in 1893. I hope one or both of these gentlemen will be able to
tell us how long these birds sit.

Of the smaller Quails Coturnix coiomandelica went to nest
with Dr. Russ, but failed to hatch : in May, 1903, Mr. Reslie
Setli-Smith bred it, but was unable to note the period of
incubation; this was fortunately remedied by Mr. George C.
Swailes (Avic. Mag. N. S. Vol. I. p. 480) who gave eighteen days as
the period. Respecting the Chinese Painted Quail ( Excalfactoria
chinensis) there seems some uncertainty, Russ giving sixteen to
eighteen days as the period, Mr. Meade-Waldo nineteen days,
Mr. Seth-Smith nineteen to twenty; later (Avic. Mag. N. S. Vol.
I. p. 321) he says twenty-one to twenty-two, but I think that
reckoning must include the morning in which the young hatched
--perhaps very early, which surely should not be taken into
account.* 1 Perdicjila cambaiensis, according to Russ, hatches in
twenty-one days, and he says no doubt P. argoondah does the
same, but his young hatched when he was away from home. Of
the species of Callipepla Major Bendire says that C. californica,
popularly known as the Californian Quail, probably takes
twenty-one days, though it has been credited with a longer
period, and C. gambeli twenty-one to twenty-four ; Oreortyx
pictus twenty-one days.
Of the Hemipodes T. nigricollis has been bred by Rieut.
Hauth and others in Germany, and all agree that incubation lasts
thirteen days in the case of this species. Rieut. Hauth also bred
T. lepurana , the young hatching on the thirteenth day, which
gives twelve days of incubation ; T. tanki bred by Mr. D. Seth-
Smith also incubated twelve days (Avic. Mag. N. S. Vol. I. p.
321). It is a great pity that we cannot obtain these interesting
birds at a reasonable price, as they can in Germany. Dr. Russ
speaks of 15-20 Marks for a pair of Black-necked Hemipodes as
a tolerably high price ! f
Some of the Tinamous being pleasing little birds for the
aviary, it may be well to note that Mr. Seth-Smith gives twenty-
one days as the period of incubation for Crypturus tataupa
(Avic. Mag. N. S. II. pp. 287-8); it is however interesting to
note that the hatching of the eggs in the third nest, in mid-
* On the other hand Mr. Seth-Smith's careful observations have shown on two occasions,
that the period of incubation may be modified by the temperature,

that amount.

summer, was accelerated ; and took place after nineteen days.
The Rufous Tinamou (. Rhynchotus rufescens) incubates for twenty-
one days, according to the late Mr. Bartlett.
Taking the larger Parrots and Crows as types of long-
lived birds, we find that the incubation of the former lasts
between three and four weeks, or, allowing a slight margin
because of the difficulty of obtaining exact data in the case of
birds which lay at irregular intervals in holes, we will say three
weeks ; that of the latter about the same period. On the other
hand if we take the Zebra-finch and Silverbills as types of short-
lived birds (and I have found them distinctly more so than many
other Grass-finches which are less easily bred) we find that their
period of incubation is only eleven days. This certainly looks
as if there were some connection between the two facts.
As aviary birds, whatever they may be when at liberty,
doves are undoubtedly long-lived, and retain their full vitality
for many years ; as is evident from the fact that one of my male
Necklaced-doves, purchased in 1894, is now breeding with a
white Barbary-dove; and my Bronze-winged Pigeons, purchased
in 1897, have spent the past winter in an open out-door aviary;
in the large doves seventeen to nineteen days is a fair average
for the hatching of the young.
The typical Thrushes I believe are not naturally long-
lived birds, so that one might expect their period of incubation
to be short. On the other hand, I think the larger Mynahs live
to a good age ; consequently their eggs should be more slowly
developed.
In Mr. Evans' papers previously referred to, the following
may be summarized as desiderata in the foregoing account :--
Chats about 14 days; Warblers 11-16 days, but mostly 13-15
days; Wagtails 13-14 days; Swallow 15-16 days; Park 13-14
days; Nuthatch 13-14days ; Tits 14-17 days ; Flycatcher 14 days ;
Zosterops 9-10 days; Creeper 15 days; Crossbill 14-15 days;
Woodpeckers 14-18 days ; Nicobar Pigeon 28 days ; Crows 17-19
days; Kingfishers 14-19 days ; Rollers 18-20 days ; Cockatoos 21
days ; but these papers should be studied carefully in con-
junction with the present one.

SUFFOLK.
By Hugh Whistler.
On August 3rd of last year (1904) I visited the parish of
St. Margaret's, which is situated in the district of South Elniham,
near the River Waveney, which is the boundary between Norfolk
and Suffolk. The village of St. Margaret's is very small indeed,
only boasting one shop, so that whatever is needed that the shop
cannot supply has to be got from either Bungay or Harleston,
both of which are at least five miles off. The only houses of
any consequence in St. Margaret's itself are the Rectory and South
Elniham Hall, the latter being built close to the ruins of the
palace of Felix, the first Bishop of Norwich, and about half a
mile from the Minster, an ancient edifice surrounded by a raised
bank in the shape of a square, now covered with trees. The
Rectory has fine grounds, and in front of the house is a moat
forming an island, now partly overgrown. Without any further
preamble, I will state my observations, made during a stay of
nearly three weeks, occasionally referring to what I noticed in
former visits ; although I have no notes by me of my earlier
holidays there.
The Kestrel (Falco tinnuncuhis&apos;) is plentiful (thanks to
the enlightenment of the inhabitants, who discriminate between
this bird and the Sparrowliawk) and it gave me great pleasure
to observe that one could practically be sure of seeing some
in one's walks abroad. I was much struck by the beautiful
manner in which they hovered over the fields when searching for
food, remaining in the same spot, although their wings were
beating up and down. The lady whom I was staying with had
several young " Windovers," as they are locally called, which
came from a nest containing six 3^0ling ones in a tree in front of
the main doorway of South Elniham Hall. I11 this same tree
was another nest containing more young Kestrels, and on inquiry
I found that they had bred in it every year for many } r ears, in
spite of often being disturbed. There had also been another
nest quite near to the other two last }^ear, the young from which,
I believe, got off safeE, with the exception of one bird, which a
gentleman wounded slightly and put in a cage, where It seemed

Mr. Hugh Whistler,
to be doing quite well when I saw it. I am glad to be able to
state that the Kestrel is certainly on tlie increase there.
Although the Spotted Flycatchei &apos;{Miiscicapa grisolci) seemed
scarcer than usual down in Sussex last year, I was pleased to find
them fairly numerous in Suffolk, but I noticed more in the latter
half of my visit than I saw promise of at first. They were
common in the locality of " the Island," and seemed to like a
young tree which overhung the water, from wdience they were
accustomed to dash out after passing flies. I remember one in
particular which generally took up his stand on a tenuis net and
occasionally used to chase passing Swallows. I always wondered
whether he was trying piracy! Many years ago, on a former
visit, I saw a nest of this species built in a rose tree, climbing
up the house at which I stayed. This was the only Flycatcher's
nest I ever saw there.
I saw a good number of Missel Thrushes ( Turdus vis civ or us)&apos;
about, in almost every instance in pairs. Song Thrushes (71
vmsicus ) and Blackbirds (71 merula ) were very common, and
seem to be on the increase there, as in many other localities. If
anything one saw less of our sable friend than of the Song
Thrush. Robins were very common. To my mind the Hedge
Sparrow {Accenior viodularis) locally known as the " Hedgepoke,"
a name which is very descriptive of its way of threading in and
out of hedges, is rather a mournful looking little bird as he
silently hops along the ground, occasionally flirting his wings.
The Nightingale ( Dciulias luscinia ) though undoubtedly a
constant visitor to the neighbourhood, confines himself to the
small copses which are few and far between. One nest I remem-
ber was found close to the Island, near the Rectory, in an over-
grown ditch.
Once or twice I saw a Resser Whitethroat ( Sylvia curruca)
after insects, hovering or perching by a window of the house
where I was staying. Reed Warblers frequent a water-course
between the Rectory and South Elmham Hall, whence their eggs
have been taken.
Redstarts (Ruticilla phcenicnra) were frequently to be seen
on the road leading from St. Margarets to St. Peters, and also at
Flixtou. I was very pleased to see, two days before my departure.

a family of the pleasing little Golden-crested Wrens (Regulus
cristaius&apos;) busily searching for food in some evergreens by the
moat in front of the Rector)&apos;&apos;. Marsh Tits {Par us pa lus iris&apos;) were
frequently to be found scattered about, most commonly I think in
pairs, and one day I had an opportunity of examining one which
had been shot from the Island. Besides the above-mentioned
species I saw the Coal and Blue Tits {Parus ater) and (P. coeruleus&apos;)
and I remember finding a beautiful little nest of the Long-tailed
or Bottle Tit ( Acredula caudata), containing eggs, in a hedge
bordering 011 the tenuis court where I was staying.
On August 8th I found a late nest of the Greenfinch
(,Ligurinus clitoris&apos;) with four young, only recently hatched.
Personally I did not come across the Hawfinch {Coccothraustes
vulgaris ), but I heard of two specimens taken near St. Margaret's.
The Chaffinch (. Fringilla ccelebs ) known locally as the " Spink "
from its call, and the Linnet ( Acanthis cannabina ) were plentiful
everywhere; but I can only remember seeing Bullfinches
{Pyrrhula europced) in one locality, namely, the road from St.
Margaret's to St. Peter's.
I am afraid the Goldfinch {Carduelis elegans) is not common
in the neighbourhood of St. Margarets, as, though I kept an eye
open for them, I only saw a party of five all the time I was there.
The perseverance of the House Sparrow {Passer domesticus)
is marvellous ; for example, the owner of the house I was staying
in had the Sparrows' nests round the house (of which there were
not a few) destroyed, because of the damage these birds do, and
within a few days some of them began again constructing great
untidy nests in the rose bushes all up the house.
House Martins {Chelidon urbica ) may be seen nesting on
nearly every house. South Elmliam Hall is particularly favoured
by them, nests being built on it on every available place, in
extraordinary numbers. I only saw Sand Martins {Cotile riparia )
on two occasions, the first being on August 10th, along the River
Waveuey below Beccles ; and the second on August 19th, when
I was surprised to see these birds nesting close to the beach at
Lowestoft, which is much frequented by trippers, houses being
close by.
Pied Wagtails {Motacilla lugubris ) had evidently had a good

breeding year in St. Margaret's, as nearly all I saw were birds ot
this year : but though this species was so common, I did not
come across any other. Skylarks were very common.
The Swift (Cyseptus opus&apos;) was frequently to be seeti until the
second week in August. I saw one as late as the 13th, but after
that all had disappeared. The flesh of the Starling ( Sturnus
vulgaris ) is very bitter in taste and smell, and it was probably
for this reason that a Kestrel I once had. as a pet, refused to eat
them, although he would accept other birds.
I was surprised to find a Wren's nest against the trunk ot
a tree near the Island, in exactly the same place as I found one
containing young two years ago ; both nests I should think were
probably built by the same bird or its descendants. With regard
to the so-called " cock-nests" of this bird, I think that the Wren
probably builds them for employment, as Weavers do in captivity.
The Green Woodpecker fficus viridis&apos;) must be very
common in Suffolk, as its laughing cry was to be heard every-
where. Tree Creepers {Cerlhia familiar is&apos;) were not uncommon,
and Turtle Doves ( Turtur communis) fairly numerous. Wood-
Pigeons ( Columba palumbus ) were much commoner than Turtle
Doves, and were always to be found in trees round the Minster.
The nearest Rookery to St. Margarets was an old one at
the Minster, which was apparently, for some unknown reason,
recently deserted. The only time I saw Jackdaws was wdien I
saw some in company with a crowd of Rooks.
I have seen Herons ( Ardea cinereal) probably on their way
to the banks of the Waveney, w&apos;here they are frequently to be
seen.
On the last evening but one of my stay I had a stalk after
a flock of Lapwings ( Vanellus vulgaris) 011 a plough, but did not
succeed in getting a shot. The white in their plumage as they
raised their wings when running about was visible a long way off.
Water hens ( Gallinula chloropus&apos;) w r ere common, and distributed
all over the place. In the moat in front of the Rectory they
always breed, and I found a nest at the edge of the reeds a few
yards from the tennis courts, which I consider a strange place for
so shy a bird, as there was no fence or hedge intervening.
With regard to Game birds, there did not seem to be a
very good prospect for the shooting season.

The Emu, tlie journal of the Australasian Ornithologists'
Union continues its useful career. The October number
contains, amongst much very interesting matter, a valuable
article on a trip undertaken by Mr. J. F. Kilgour to the Ord
River, North-West Australia. Many of the birds met with are
familiar to Aviculturists in this country, such as Zebra, Gouldian,
Pectoral, Rufous-tailed, Masked, Roug-tailed and Crimson
Finches, most of which were extremely numerous in certain
parts where the grass was long and plentiful. Bare-eyed
Cockatoos (Cacatua gymnopisj were seen in flocks of between
sixty and seventy thousand; and a eucalyptus with a large
salmon-coloured flower afforded food for immense numbers of
Red-collared Lorikeets ( IVichoglossus rubritorquis).
A correspondent described a hybrid Parrakeet, bred in
captivity between the Mealy Rosella (.Platycercus pallidiceps) and
the Yellow-vented Blue-bonnet ( Psepholus xanthoirhous) two
species that have probably never been known to hybridize
before.
The January number contains an account of the fourth
annual session of the Australasian Ornithologists' Union,
recently held at Sydney, and several of the papers read are
printed in full. Captain Hutton, F.R.S., writes on the
"Geographical Origin and Subsequent Development of the Rand
Birds of New Zealand ; " Colonel Regge, on " Birds observed
at the Great Lake (Tasmania) in the month of March ; " and
Mr. A. G. Campbell on " Some Comparisons of Victorian and
Tasmanian Birds."
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE TANAGRIDHJ AS FINCHES.
Sir, --The older Members of our Society will probably remember
that in Vol. IV. of the first series (p. 181) Mr. S. Perkins asked me the
question "as to whether or not it is more improper to call a Nightingale a
Warbler than to call a Tauager a Finch " ; and he proceeded to inform us
that no modern Ornithologists include the Tanagridce in the Fringillidce.

In looking through Ridgway's splendid work 011 the "Birds of North
and Middle America" recently, I came across the following remarks: --
" The group most closely related to the Fringillidce is, of course, that called
Tanagridce, or at least certain members of the latter," and he proposes to
transfer certain genera, including Saltator, to the Fringillidce, *"as having un-
questionably fringilline relationships.
It will be remembered that Dr. Sclater speaks of the Tanagers as
" dentirostral finches" in which the beak is modified to enable the owner to
feed upon fruit; and, though we are well aware that some Tanagers will
eat and are able to husk seeds, while some Finches eat a good deal of fruit,
it is rather a shock to be asked to call some of the tooth-billed groups true
finches.
I note that in the work above referred to the family Fringillidce is
again characterized as " nine-primaried " ; yet, unless I am very much mis-
taken, Dr. Baird was the first to record the fact that the so-called " bastard-
primary " is not absent in these birds. Later it was again called attention
to by Dr. Hartert, and still later by myself (Zoologist 1S9S, pp. 241-4).
Possibly it may be incorrect to speak of the tenth primary in the
Fringillidce as a primary, because it is shorter than its coverts (see Pycraft
" Topography of a Bird " Avic. Mag., New Series, Vol. I., p. 161); but surely
in that case the family should be characterized as having "nine primaries
and a remicle," which--to all intents and purposes -- is equivalent to ten :
the fact is that this "remicle" iu some Fringillidce. is larger than the
bastard-primary in some Ploceidce, in which however the coverts are pro-
portionably smaller. A. G. Bu&apos;i&apos;per.
THE EGGS OF THE SMEW AND MISTLE THRUSH.
Sir, --In the last number of the Avicultural Magazine iu the article
on the Smew, by your esteemed correspondent Mr. J. Lewis Bonliote, the eggs
of the Smew are described as being very like those of the Golden-eye.
This is inaccurate. The eggs of the Smew are very like those of the Wigeou
(vide Yarrell and Howard Saunders). They are not at all like those of the
Golden-eye, which are bright green, whereas those of the Smew are cream-
coloured like Wigeons', only with more gloss and smoother surface; they
are also heavier when weighed with Wigeons' eggs.
I11 the article by Mr. W. E. Reliant I can bear him out iu his state-
ment that the Missel Thrush lays five eggs sometimes, having found
clutches of five on two occasions, though four is much more general.
Perhaps this statement about the Smew's eggs will be corrected in a
future number.* F. W. PROCTOR.
* I am much indebted to Major Proctor for pointing&apos; out my careless slip. Of course
he is quite right.--the eggs of the Smew resemble those of the Wigeou.--J. L. B.

Sir, -- I duly received the Oct. number of the Avicullural Magazine
a few days ago. I should be very sorry to be without this monthly visitor ;
I always look forward to its coming.
I have 110 aviary, though soon I intend to go in for one, but for many
years have been an earnest observer, and I may say student, of the bird life
around me. I have collected, taken the dimensions, descriptions and
habits, as far as in me lay, of now about 130 different birds; and I have
still, I calculate, 40 or 50 more to get. I have painted copies of all these as
exactly as I possibly could.
Here we have the following Finches. My nomenclature is from

tame and healthy ; they are very scarce birds here, but I have them on my

They feed here on the ripe seed of the elder tree, and come for this and go

here every year ; they are pretty birds, and the cock has a beautiful, or
perhaps I should say a very powerful, song. It is a pretty bird, and the

No. 20. Common here at certain seasons ; we see them in flocks and
in pairs. The cock has a most pleasant song, and is very fond of hearing
his own voice.
I have given you this list of the Fringillidce, as perhaps these are the
easier birds to keep in captivity. As I have said before I hope soon to be
able to put up an aviary and stock it, and then I will send you more if you
like to hear from me.
The Orange-billed Tauager (.Solicitor aurcintiirosiris), which is the
subject of the coloured plate for October, is very common here. He does a
lot of mischief too : he has a habit of biting the vine sprout just below the
young bunch of grapes, apparently only to suck the iume of the stem, as it
is not left cut, but simply flattened out. The colouring on the plate is
slightly 7 different from that of the bird here, but this may differ in the
different localities. We are here in lat. 27 0 more or less, but at 4000 feet
above sea level. This is an oasis, as we are surrounded on three sides by
an arid plain; and to the north by high mountains--the highest peak,
Aconquija, being iS,ooo feet above sea level--and of course with eternal
snow ; so we get any amount of birds and a great variation in climate.
Here we are full of fruits of all kinds, maize, wheat, vineyards. &amp;c,, hence
lots of birds come to the feasting. Of the Tyrannidce I have now observed
and painted 30 species--and so on.
I send you a description of our Saltator, so you will see it is rather
different:--Above, grey 7 ; slight olive on back and on tail coverts; top of

head, dark, slate grey. Superciliary stripe, which commences above the
eye, white, changing into buff, runs down each side of nape. Throat,

ciliary stripe. Sides of the head, face, and throat, black. Wing, dark
maroon brown, with light edgings. Tail, dark, the outside rectrices with
rather deep tip of white, the second and third on each side with the
slightest bit of a white tip. The buff of lower throat goes into rather
brighter colour lower down. Thighs and lower tail-coverts again brighter.
Feet, brownish horn-colour. Beak, orange, slightly yellower at the tip ;

THE MOULTING OF THE RED-BACKED SHRIKE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994957827586207" page_id="32656667"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In his very interesting article on "The Breeding of the Red-
backed Shrike in Captivity " in the October number of the Magazine, Dr.
Gunther states that his young birds moulted " late in the autumn, and
proved to be two males and one female."
I call attention to Dr. Gunther's observation in the hope that some o
our members may be able to throw further light 011 this point.
I11 the "Feathered World" recently appeared a contribution by Dr.
S. H. Snell, giving notes on a young male Red-backed Shrike which he
kept from August in one year to the end of the following summer. Dr.
Snell says u In March he commenced to moult. First he shed his mottled
brown tail and acquired the black and white one. Then the breast
moulted, losing the crescentic brown markings and coming out white, with
a lovely pinkish tinge. The hitherto brown streak under the eye became
black, and then the brown head gradually became a beautiful blue grey---
the whole process occupying about a mouth."
In July, 1904, I obtained two young Shrikes, which I believe to have
been both males, and I kept them under close observation for five months.
During the whole of this time there was no material change in their
plumage, except that the ground colour of the breast feathers became
rather lighter. Owing to the fierce fights between my two birds they lost
their tails. One of them renewed the latter appendage twice but 011 each
occasion the new feathers were identical in colour with the original ones.
Towards the end of December I lost both birds and sent one to Dr. Butler,
who wrote me as follows under date December 2Sth, 1904:--
"The bird is undoubtedly still in nestling plumage, with barred
upper surface and ill-defined superciliary streak."
Unless we ascribe the difference in the period of the moult to
difference in treatment, this seems to be a point on which further informa-
tion would be interesting.

I see that Dr. Butler rejects Seebom's theory that the Shrikes impale
their prey on thorns because their feet are not powerful enough to hold it,
during the process of dissection.
It is quite true, as Dr. Gunther remarks, that this bird " uses its claws
in an attack upon an enemy"; but I have seen a Starling, when taken by
a trained Merlin, turn on its back and clutch the little hawk with an iron
grip--yet the Starling is not a predatory bird. I have also seen my birds
use their feet for holding a cockroach, but not in the same manner as a
Hawk. The Shrike stands on one foot, and grasps the quarry on the
other. He then rests the shin bone on the perch and, leaning forward,
proceeds to dissect the victim. My birds were quite incapable of tearing up
a bird or mouse until it was firmly tied to a perch for them.
I do not venture an opinion on this point myself, but I see that
Dr. Snell adopts what may perhaps be called the more commonly received
theory. He says: "The Shrike had one particular thorn, a straight
upstanding spike, and to this immediately on being supplied with flesh,
beetles, etc., indeed anything which it could not bolt whole, the bird
always resorted, spiking the morsel, then tearing small pieces off with its
beak."
In conclusion I may say that I found my Shrikes most interesting
birds, full of character and well worth the little extra catering required.
I believe the best food to be young mice. A shrike will eat almost anything
but there is evidently a limit to what he can digest. 1 advertised for some
black beetles and received some ship's cockroaches--the most fearsome
looking beasts imaginable. However, I administered several and within
two da}-s both birds--hitherto perfectly healthy--were dead.

LIVING BIRDS ATTACKED BY MAGGOTS.
fo the Hon. Correspondence Secretary.
Dear Dr. Buteer, -- Knowing you to be an insect specialist, I am
enclosing some flies for the favour of identification. The following is their
history :--
A few weeks ago, I procured a nest containing two young Hangnests
[Icterus xanthornis) about eight da}'s old. In a few days I found that the
smaller bird had a swelling under the skin, close to the e3'e-ball. The
larger bird had two such swellings on the throat, and one on the abdomen
--in each case just under the skin. I soon discovered, principally from
the shape, that each swelling was nothing more nor less than a live maggot,
about half an inch long. All went well until the birds had been five or six
da}-s in my possession, when the maggots disappeared ; upon searching
under the hay upon which the birds had been nestling, I discovered about a
dozen live fat maggots. I thus came to the conclusion that other maggots,
as well as those I had located, had been parasitic upon the young birds.

These maggots were placed in a bottle, when they soon entered the pupa
state, in due course being transformed into the flies herewith enclosed.
There are two sizes of the flies, which I presume are the different sexes.
Unfortunately, I was unable to rear either of the young Hangaests. The
smaller one died suddenly after about a week, and the other followed a few
days later. I shall be pleased to send you the nest, if it will interest you.
This species of Hauguest is known locally as " plantain-bird." It is not
included in your " Foreign Bird-keeping," nor do I see it in the Zoo. list.
Georgetown, Demerara, E- W. Harper.
British Guiana.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Harper:
Unfortunately the only work I ever did in connection with Dipterous
insects was in 1874, when I completed the account of the New Zealand
Insects -- (. Diciyoplera , Orthoptera, Neuroptera, Rhynchota, Diptera, and
Lepidoptera ) for the voyage of H.M.S. " Erebus " and " Terror." However
I will submit the specimens of Diptera to the Specialist at the Natural
History Museum, and ask him to communicate with you.
It is an interesting fact that living birds should be attacked by
Dipterous parasites after the manner of Cattle. A. G. But PER.

Mr. St. Quintin writes under date February 17th :
" My Ravens have been sitting a week to-day,--or rather the hen
bird, for the cock takes no share in incubation duties."
THE FOOD OF PARROTS.
Sir, --The suggestion of Canon Dutton that perhaps animal fat
might be used with advantage in cases of feather plucking and eating by
Parrots is very interesting to me.
I have often wondered whether the regular supply of butter, etc. that
I gave my Rosella was the cause of his plumage remaining so thick and
glossy all his life.
The taxidermist was particularly struck with its beauty, and said lie
had seldom had a bird--even a young one--in such good condition.
This, after over 27 years of cage life, is remarkable.
Winifred M. Sopp.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Grr.L, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
PiNTAir, NONPAREir, (Dr. Tanner). [Your feeding was quite correct. The
bird died of pneumonia].
Patagonian Conure (MissR. Alderson). The bird has been ailing a long
time, eating little but green food. It used to have occasional attacks of
sickness with a kind of froth coming out of its beak. It has got
gradually weaker. [The bird was much wasted owing to inanition.
The liver is much congested and would account for the symptoms you
mention. It is a hen].
Ribbon Finch and Hen Gourdian (The Hon. Mrs. O. Hodgson).
Ribbon Finch appeared at first only unable to fly and remained on
floor of aviary. Not very puff)'. Then looked ill. Took him in, gave
castor oil and much warmth. Began to eat again, another relapse
during night. With warmth appeared to recover. Got out of cage and
found dead on floor. Hen Gouldian in good health; found dead. [The
Ribbon Finch had a fit caused by blood extravasation of the brain,
which was not sufficient to cause death immediately, but produced the
inability to fly. It ultimately caused death. Hen Gouldian died of
apoplexy. You do not say what seed they were fed on; so I cannot
assist you as to the cause of dark color of the Gouldian. It probably
has to do with the feeding].

Extracts from a letter from Mr. J. PARKINSON,
NATURALIST,
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October 30th, iqoi.
" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot
Parrots which I have reared were brought up 011 your Aesthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot F'ood.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young&apos; ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE " of Dec. 4th
Says-- " Mr. Parkinson has apparently solved the problem of
Parrot-rearing, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

THE ARCHBISHOP TANAGER.
Tanagra ornata.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., &amp;c.
Although not so dazzling in colours as the species of the
genus Calliste, the forms of Tanagra are certainly quite as
beautiful, and the subject of the present article is by no means
one of the least attractive.
T. ornata is a native of South-Eastern Brazil, being
abundant in the woodlands of the central coastal tract, especially
at Bahia and its neighbourhood ; lives like all Tanagers near the
settlements, comes into gardens and is not very shy, according
to Burmeister. This appears to be all that has hitherto been
recorded respecting the wild life of the Archbishop Tanager;
but doubtless, like its congeners, it builds an open nest and lays
spotted eggs.
Late in the year 1903 the Rev. Hubert D. Astley wrote to
ask me to identify for him a pair of Tanagers which he had
purchased in Italy, and forwarded with his letter a hasty
coloured sketch which he had taken from the living birds in his
aviary. Not being able just then to run up to the Natural
History Museum, I tried to identify the birds from the key to the
genus Tanagra in the Museum Catalogue, being satisfied that
they must belong to that genus ; but as Mr. Astley had told me
that there was a bright emerald green metallic patch on the
shoulder of the wing, I concluded that his birds must either be
an aberrant variation of the Blue-shouldered Tanager, or brightly
coloured females of that species: in which conclusion I was
quite wrong.

i8o Dr. A. G. Butler,
Writing on the 20th December Mr. Astley said :--
" Dear Dr. Butler,
" I am sending you the pair of Green-shouldered
Tanagers, which I hope will arrive safely. They are being
sent off Monday; and I have put apples in the cage.
As they are nice strong healthy birds to start with, they
ought to survive the journey. I hope you will care to accept
them from me, and that they will prove to be a species you
haven't before seen in the flesh.
They are decidedly quarrelsome with other birds. I
haven't found them at all delicate, but then they haven't been
out of doors in England.
Trusting they will reach you alive.
Believe me, yours truly,
Hubert D. Astley."
On Tuesday the 29th, a bitter frosty morning, the birds
reached me (11.50 a.111.); and, as the cage was open to the air in
front, and the birds had been nine days on their journey, I was
much astonished and relieved to discover that both were
apparently in the best of health.
It appears that Mr. Astley did not cover up the cage, as he
had written upon it " Fruit eaters," and hoped that some kind
person would put a bit of apple or orange in for them : perhaps
it was as well that this was not done; for it is probable that,
in that event, the birds would have escaped. When I slid up the
wire doors they were out in a minute into a flight-cage which I
had ready for their reception.
Having the birds before me I again took up the Catalogue
and decided that they were not referable to Tanagra cyanoptera,
but to T. ornata ; and a subsequent visit to the Museum con-
firmed this identification : having them more closely under my
eye than Mr. Astley had when he described them, I saw that the
centre of the green patch on the wing-coverts was bright
chrome yellow, much less prominently so than in the Museum
specimens indeed, but probably the size of the yellow patch
increases with age. *
The yellow patch is oti the long fringes of the lesser coverts, which therefore Dr. Sclater
describes as edged with yellow.

The birds were apparently a pair, the larger and heavier
bird being the hen ; as it was altogether duller in colouring, the
blue of the head and neck not extending so far down the breast;
and, although Mr. Astley wrote " They always seemed quite
friendly with each other" I found that the undoubted cock went
in fear of his life, and was afraid to leave the food-pan; whilst
the supposed hen, in like manner, after one or two brisk
encounters with its companion, in which both were more
frightened than hurt (though he certainly had the worst of it in
these brushes) could not summon up courage to leave the perch
to eat.
For about three days I was obliged to feed the latter by
squeezing banana through the wires above the perch : whilst,
for drinking purposes, I had to hang up a tin of water close to
it: still, as this could not be allowed to go on, I decided to move
the birds to a larger flight, so cleared out one measuring three
feet six inches in length, with a perch towards each end. In
this cage the birds were at first tolerably friendly; and, though
the cock still continued nervous when he and his companion
were feeding from the same saucer, and used at times to shrink
back and whimper in a truly ludicrous fashion, I hoped that all
was going on satisfactorily.
From the first the undoubted male occasionally had
sneezing fits, but mostly after washing, whereas the other bird
seemed only to suffer from ill-temper : but about the 21st of
January the latter became spiteful and flew at its companion
each time that he went down to feed ; so that presently I had to
adopt the same plan for providing him with food and water,
which I had previously adopted for his partner: the latter now
drooped its wings, puffed out its feathers, and daily grew worse.
On the morning of the 28th I dipped a piece of Madeira
cake in castor oil and held it to the wires ; the sick bird pecked
and swallowed some of this (I supposed it was only suffering
from some little stomach trouble); in the afternoon I found food
and saucer splashed all over with vivid red blood, apparently
thrown up from the bird's lungs ; and, 011 the morning of the
29th, I found it dead under its perch,--just one month after it
had reached me : doubtless the cold and exposure to Irosty
weather had affected its lungs.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
Up to this date I had only heard the call-note of these
birds ; a thin sibilant tseet, which somewhat reminded me of
the plaintive penetrating call of a Robin or Blackbird, though
not so prolonged; but the relief from persecution seemed so to
cheer the cock bird, that, a day or two later, he began to sing,
and this he continued to do each morning.
The song begins with a sort of descending chatter like
the quarrelling of Sparrows ; then follows a series of thin reedy
notes, with one or two clear sharp whistles thrown out spasmod-
ically by way of a change, recalling the recording of a Dominican
Cardinal's song : it can hardly be praised as a musical effort.
On sending off the dead bird to be made into a skin, I
asked the taxidermist to make sure of the sex, and, to my
surprise, it was returned to me as an undoubted cock bird ; so
that, if both had lived and I had essayed (as I was much tempted
to do) to breed with them, I should perchance have wasted my
time: yet anybody looking at the two birds when caged together,
would have supposed them to belong to different sexes. It would
be interesting to me to know whether the same man sexed this
bird and my cock Red-headed Cardinal, which was declared to
be a hen.
In the case of Superb Tauagers which I have at various
times sexed when alive, the post mortem examinations have
invariably corresponded with my decisions ; but it would seem
that the sexual differences in Archbishop Tanagers cannot be
thus easily defined, and that the colouring, and the size of the
individuals of the same sex, are liable to variation ; possibly in
relation to the age of the birds : doubtless there is some reliable
sexual difference (as in many of the true finches and the weaving
finches) in the contour of the head and beak, which is at once
apparent to the birds themselves; and in all probability would
be recognized by the trained eye of an aviculturist, if he could
compare a series of sexed specimens side by side.
At first I fed these birds upon "Century Food" and
preserved yolk, mixed with sweet biscuit and bread crumbs and
slightly damped ; together with apple and banana ; later I tried
them with orange and grapes, both of which they took to readily.
At first they refused mealworms, but after about a week they ate

them readily : unlike the other Tanagers which I have kept,
they did not care for cockroaches; spiders they delighted in,
also green caterpillars and house-flies.
The surviving bird soon lost his tendency to sneeze, and
became perfectly bright and happy : he moulted very gradually
about September, appearing eventually in faultless plumage.
Familiarity, which is said to breed contempt, undoubtedly does
develop confidence in birds; for this Archbishop Tanager will
now sometimes take a mealworm from my fingers, though not
with the same boldness as my two old friends the Scarlet
Tanagers; but then I bought the latter on November 19th, 1S97,
so that I have had them over seven years.
The attitude of the Archbishop Tanager as shown by Mr.
Gronvold will probably not commend itself to the student of
skins, who usually admires a conventional attitude for his figured
birds : thus a Game-bird must always be represented with one
leg off the ground and the toes clenched; a Finch must be re-
presented either out of balance sitting stiffiy, or must be pitch-
ing forwards as if about to dive into a pond ; a Wader must have
its hinder leg hitched up almost at right angles to the other,
the tibio-tarsus sloped in to touch the latter, and all the claws
bent backwards ; and so on* But, when I have a drawing made
from life, I like to sit down with the artist and watch the bird,
until we are both convinced as to what is its favourite attitude ;
and in that attitude I have it represented.
The 'Archbishop' is a very active and alert bird, almost
as quick in its movements as a Liotlirix : therefore, to represent
it sitting in the heavy sleepy attitude of a Bullfinch or even of
the Scarlet Tanager when at rest (though it would doubtless
be approved by those not familiar with it in life) would be
misleading.
I expect Frohawk's illustration of my Diamond-Sparrows
courting has been considered unnatural, though copied from and
absolutely true to life ; and I know that the plate of my Blue-
bearded Jay was spoken of as "comical," though it represents
two of the most frequent attitudes of the bird.
* Good bird-artists will not always follow out these stereotyped rules, and their drawings
are consequently criticized as " unnatural."

Rev. Hubert D. Asteey,
Professor Ridgway is of opinion that the family Tanagridce,
as it stands in the British Museum Catalogue, is too comprehen-
sive and requires restriction (Birds of North and Middle America
Vol. I., pp. 25, 26) : some of the genera he removes to the family
Fringillidce (p. 26), others to the Bush-Creepers (Mniotiltided)
which are the New World representatives of our Warblers (Vol.
II., p. 2), on account of their slender bills. That there is great
divergence in external form, colouring, and action in the various
groups of Tanagers is certain ; therefore, whether they are dis-
tributed among different families or not, it is evident that it is
not correct to represent them all alike in the same attitude.
If the Tanagers require breaking up and distributing
amongst other groups, what will happen to the Tyrannidee ,
amongst which one meets with types varying almost from that of
a Kingfisher to a Chat or a Flycatcher in external aspect?

NOTES FROM AN OUTDOOR AVIARY ON THE
ITALIAN RIVIERA.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993610388888889" page_id="32656690"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.A., M.B.O.U., etc.
It may interest our readers to hear how foreign birds
prosper on the Italian Riviera ; although there, too, in that more
favourable climate, one has one's 'ups' and 'downs.'
I have three outdoor aviaries there, in a pretty garden
of a truly Italian type, where orange and lemon trees grow with
gladness, as also loquats and pomegranates ; where with big
clusters of roses, in the foreground, on trees which clamber over
the pergolas of vines, one sees the gorgeous blues and greens of
the Mediterranean, on which the white sails of the fishing boats
resemble flights of butterflies.
The aviaries are all at different levels, like the garden.
Two of them are quite small --really quite small, and the third is
about eight yards square and seven feet high, with a pool in the
centre through which, even in seasons of drought, the water
always runs.
Shelters made of w r ood are slung to the ware roof, (for the
whole aviary is of wire meshing,) and these shelters have a roof

of zinc over the wood ; and are divided into partitions--twelve of
these partitions on either side, with a hole to each, large enough
to admit a Senegal Dove ; but the whole shelter is open under-
neath, so that the birds can fly up to their particular partition
that they may have selected for building in, if they choose ; or if
disturbed at the entrance doors they can use the open space
beneath as a means of exit. Each partition can be a foot
square, and perches can be fastened across inside ; and on these
perches the birds can roost and shelter from the rain, or with a
few twigs placed crossways, they can soon construct their nests.
When once the nest is made and occupied, no other birds can
see into it or find it out, unless they actually trespass into the
partition. Being open underneath, all foreign matter is dropped
on the floor of the aviary, so that the partitions themselves
never have any accumulation of dirt; and old nests are easily
removed. All kinds of birds, from tiny Waxbills to Mocking-
birds and Doves, will avail themselves of such retreats.
But I fear that in this larger aviary I have yielded to the
temptation of putting in too many birds to gain any very great
success in the way of breeding; although last summer young
were hatched of Virginian Nightingales, Ruficauda Finches,
Bleeding-heart Pigeons, Diamond and Senegal Doves, and also
the little Scaly Doves from South America, and another small
Dove whose name I stupidly do not know. It is not a species I
particularly admire; its size is about that of a Thrush, its
colour a sandy brown, with a white and black stripe running
along the length of the wing--(What a miserable description,
and how amateurish !). This Dove has a quickly-sounding coo
of one note-- ou-ou-ou --which can be pronounced in a whistle,
ending each time in a query--(Again, what a description!).
Then, too, there were young Firefinches and Avadavats ;
but alas ! somebody (Pekin Robins, perhaps ?) did for all these
mites when they left the nests. The Avadavats--there are three
or four pairs--built repeatedly, and so did the Firefinches. The
Bleeding-heart Pigeons had three nests, with two eggs each
time. I tried to rear up one young one by hand, and a dear nice
bird he was, but when he was quite a big fellow he died. He
was very pretty with his large brown eye, and his chocolate-

Rev. Hubert D. Asteey,
brown plumage, with the wing-bars conspicuous, and his heart
still whole--for a friend always persists in calling them the
Broken-hearted Pigeons !
The Yellow African Singing Finches nested three times,
laying creamy white eggs ; but each time after they had nearly
sat out their time some other provoking bird destroyed the eggs.
The nest was built almost entirely of the soft hair of a biscuit-
coloured toy Pomeranian. When he was changing his coat in
the springtime there would be quite a handful after combing, and
this was eagerly seized on by the Singing Finches, who, having
carried up large beakfuls, padded it all down, by twisting round
and round, into a compact and warm nest of a Goldfinch type.
The Virginian Nightingales hatched out three nests of
three young ones in each ; and every time, when the 3 7 oung were
four or five days old, those wretched unknown robbers dragged
them out and killed them. I never could get my eye on the
culprits. It certainly was not the parents themselves, for I have
watched both of them feeding the young assiduously and with
parental pride, when I was close to them. At that time I had
not placed the covered shelters, with the partitions. The nests
were more in the open, in frameworks of wood covered with
branches of Mediterranean heath, and the frames suspended
from the roof of the aviary.
The Diamond Doves were most successful. From two
pairs there were about twenty young ones during the spring and
summer of 1904; to which I am all along referring.
Perhaps the most uncommon birds in this larger aviary
are the Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets (Neophema vemista). I
bought two pairs in Genoa as young birds ; one male was crippled
in one foot, and one died ; but the other pair is in beautiful
plumage and condition, and I do hope this couple will nest
successfully this season. They are quite sedate little Parrakeets,
and rather undemonstrative, but very pretty, and a hand-reared
one would (like the Turquoisine does) make a nice pet.
One pair of Pekin Robins built a nest in a large yellow
Marguerite daisy plant growing in the aviary, and the hen sat
well for ten days. Then, of cozirse ! on the eleventh morning the
nest was empt\q and no one knew anything about it. If the

birds could have spoken when I looked indignantly round, one
or two of them would have probably tried to persuade me it was
the cat, like a housemaid when a priceless Dresden figure is
broken ! This Pekin Robins' nest was a very deep one, made of
withered grass, of broad blades, and the eggs were pale blue,
with not very many chocolate brown spots on the broader ends
I regret now that I didn't cut the nest out of the bush, and blow
the eggs, leaving them in the nest, all complete : but then one
doesn't or won&apos;t foresee catastrophes !
The Diamond Sparrows are always building, and making
a great fuss over it, but hitherto nothing much has come of it,
beyond fussing.
The Bronze-winged Pigeons have also acted in the same
way, and their mournful and rather monotonous coo sounds con-
tinually by day and night. But this year they seem more
business-like in their nesting arrangements.
There is hardly a day all through the winter when some of
the Doves are not cooing. Palm Doves (Senegal), Diamond
Doves, Bronze-wings, Bleeding-hearts, Peaceful Doves, Scaly,
and European Turtle Doves, etc. ; so that the garden resounds
with cooings.
A pair of Nightingales have passed the winter in the
larger aviary, without any shelter, in spite of bitter weather in
January, when all the geraniums and heliotrope were cut down
and withered, and lemon trees suffered so dreadfully, that it will
be two years before they recover !
And Nonpareils, that is, Pin-tailed Nonpareils, are there
too, always roosting in the open ; the male in gorgeous plumage.
They showed great signs of building last year ; but it never went
farther than that.
There were three days in January this year, when the
snow lay thickly on the aviary wire roof, and when there was
really cold weather; so that our members who are good enough
to read my poor contribution to the Magazine, must not think
that it is always sunshine and genial warmth. I must say that
such a thing as a fog, there never is ; not even a mist. But there
come, at intervals during the winter, spells of weather which
may last for three or four days, of an extremely trying descrip-

Rev. Hubert D. Asteey,
tion. Then once more there is the gorgeous crystal clearness of
the Italian sky, and the sound of my Doves' voices is heard in
the land.
There were so many young Senegal and Diamond Doves
that I have tried the very interesting experiment of turning
them out loose in the garden, giving them a pan of seed and
water under a shelter, close to the aviary in which they were
born. Since last October I have had some of these Doves at
liberty, as well as some of the small pale brown Dove with the
white line in the wings, which I have described. In Italy it is a
risky experiment, for not only are there cats galore, (and very
hungry vulgar cats they are,) but also the Italian 'cacciatori,'
who are nothing more than loafers with guns who shoot at
everything they see with feathers on it, not including, or shall I
say with the exception of, women with ' aigrettes ' and Birds of
Paradise plumes etc : at which I should like to have a shot, if
one could knock off the hats without injuring (bodily) the
wearers! But for the protection of my Doves in the garden I
let the cats know that I am their declared enemy, and I have
put up notice boards on two tree-trunks on the confines of
my garden, most politely begging of the said 'cacciatori ' not to
shoot at any Doves that they may see.
These Doves, having been bred in the place and having
their parents constantly cooing in the aviary, have stayed and
are quite domesticated ; though, alas ! there are not so many as
there should be. A pair of the little light brown Doves have a
nest, (as I write, in the first week of March,) in a large fig tree ;
a pair ot Diamond Doves come regularly to pick up some
millet seed which I throw down on the cobble pavement outside
my sitting-room, and then they fly into the orange trees. A
pair of Diamond Doves in perfect condition, sitting cooing and
preening their feathers in an orange tree, with the golden fruit
hanging over their small grey heads, and the brilliant blue of
the Mediterranean in the background is worth seeing.
These Diamond Doves are, I think, about to nest. The
little male bird is constantly spreading his slender tail and
cooing to his mate. When we are sitting out of doors these
delightful little birds will settle at our feet and run quite fear-

lessly all round us; and the Senegal Doves are almost as tame,
their pretty soft Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo sounding from the orange
and magnolia trees.
Now I relate this experience with these Doves to show to
our members the fact that it is quite possible to domesticate
various species, especially if one has an aviary given up to them
into which they can go in and out to obtain their food ; as such
a plan would be more likely to keep them nearer home. For
here in Italy, one is much more handicapped ; the garden is not
a very large one, and is surrounded by public paths, and on one
side the high road is quite close by.
I see no reason why Crested Pigeons and Bronzewings, etc.
should not also remain : of course I am speaking of birds bred
on the spot where they are turned out. But I particularly
recommend the Diamond Doves, so long as some others are
enclosed in an aviary near by: they seem to have a homing
instinct, and are, with their arrow-like flight, so beautiful on the
wing.
A few mornings ago, a little cock Diamond Dove was
cooing in an orange tree close to me, on a level with my face, as
I was standing on an upper terrace, above the wall of which
grow the orange trees from below ; when suddenly he shot out
and went soaring up and away over the sea, coming down again
with outspread wings, rather after the manner of a Wood -
Pigeon. I have seen the Senegal Doves do the same; and
indeed the Barbary Doves act likewise, when courting their
wives.
In these wonderful days of early spring in Italy I am
awakened in the sunny mornings by the voice of a Diamond
Dove, as he sits cooing on the top of a vine pergola, beneath
my bedroom window.
I reared up two by hand last May (1904) for my wife, and
the little male bird is most devoted to her. He is constantly out
of his cage in her sitting-room, and if he is perching on the
curtain-rod, and she holds out her hand and says 'Come along,
Seed-Pearl,' down he conies like an arrow to sit on her finger
and coo. At other times, when she is writing letters, he is quite
de trop, for he insists on running all over the sheet of paper, and

much as to say ' Come now, do leave off that tiresome letter-
writing, and attend to me ! ' He is in most beautiful condition
and plumage ; and sometimes has a flight in the garden, darting
from a tree on to my wife's shoulder or hand, when she comes
out to call him.
Should this account be in the least acceptable to any of
our members, I might perhaps be able, on another occasion, to
write something about the inmates of another aviary in the
garden.

THB RAVEN (Corvus corax).
"The Raven himself is hoarse,
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under 1113&apos; battlements."
Shalcspeare put these words into the mouth of Rady
Macbeth, ana he only gave expression to the legend which has
existed from days of old, and which is still in vogue among the
credulous, that the Raven is a bird of evil omen. The field
naturalist, however, though he may take an interest in the quaint
stories which have grown up in connection with this bird, }^et
shuns him not for his evil reputation, but takes every opportunity
of making a closer acquaintance with him in his wild haunts
" far from the madding crowd." For the Raven, alas ! is one of
our vanishing birds. It is true that in many of the wilder parts
of our Islands he still holds his own, and may even be increasing
in numbers; but he is an outcast, an outlaw of the air, and
though Parliament has in some cases extended to him the aegis
of its protection, still the shepherd and farmer look upon
him witli suspicion, and consider him to be a dangerous and
undesirable neighbour.
I have always loved this grand bird and his lonely haunts,
and as possibly I have seen more of him in a wild state in
our Islands than many bird-lovers, a few notes may not prove
altogether uninteresting.

This species in former days nested frequently on trees, and
there must be few readers of bird books who cannot claim some
acquaintance with the " Raven Trees" immortalized by Gilbert
White and A. E. Knox. A great many of these inland nesting
haunts on trees have now been deserted, and so perhaps I am
fortunate, considering that I am still a member of the " younger
generation," in having, not many years ago, visited an inhabited
" Raven Tree." We were spending part of an Easter vacation at
a farm house on the wilds of Dartmoor. On April 23rd, during
one of our daily tramps, we heard the hoarse croak of a Raven
above us, and this was soon answered by its mate, and the two
flew over our heads evidently annoyed at our intrusion. From
their behaviour it was evident they had a nest somewhere near*
and this we thought would probably be placed in some of the
wilder crags or tors in the neighbourhood. But we were nearer
to the nest than we thought, for 011 looking up we saw it, a pile of
large sticks, among the topmost branches of a tree almost over
our heads. It was a huge Scotch Fir, towering above its neigh-
bours, with a wide bole and not a branch anywhere near the
ground. Of course we soon determined that one of us must see
into that nest, but the task of scaling the tree looked a most
formidable one. Fortunately there was a pair of climbing irons
at the farm, a mile or so away, and so with the help of these the
most agile member of the party began the assault. It was a long
business and not without danger. The parent birds were very bold
and swooped so close to the climber that we thought they meant
to attack him, so we had to shout and clap our hands to keep them
off. At length the nest was reached, and there, on a lining of
soft material lay one young bird, nearly fledged, the sole occupant
of the nest. We felt that now we had outwitted the crafty birds,
so their ugly offspring was left in peace ; the male bird, however,
seemed much upset by this unwonted intrusion ; and many a
mile did he follow us over the moor to see us safely off the
premises. Perhaps " Raven Trees " may be commoner than we
think ; we only hope they are, but w T e would advise anyone
who wishes to see this grand bird at home, to visit the wilder
mountainous parts of Wales or the rugged sea cliffs in the South
West of England. Many a nest have I seen in this latter

locality, placed securely on the face of a cliff above the sea, and
quite inaccessible without the aid of a rope. The large black
birds show to advantage among the screaming white Sea-gulls,
which often nest all around them.
Anyone who in early Spring has visited a Raven's strong-
hold on the sea cliffs must have been impressed by the scene
before him. One such fortress I have in mind as I write. The
Ravens have been known there, on and off, for well over half a
century. Probably they have nested there from time immemorial.
The site has been well chosen. The grassy Down above slopes
off abruptly and then drops sheer into the sea. A deep fissure
runs vertically down the face of the cliff, and half way up this,
on a ledge under a huge overhanging stone the Ravens have
added year after 3 7 ear to the pile of sticks which forms the nest.
The neighbourhood is a favourite haunt of sea and shore birds,
but long before the Curlews and Dunlins have left for their
moorland homes, long before the Sheld-duck has inspected her
burrow, or the Gull has commenced her scanty nest on the cliff,
the Ravens have been busy with their domestic duties. Last
3 7 ear, storm and rain had loosened the overhanging boulder and
the crafty birds were quick to discover their danger. Accordingly
they set to work to build a new nest a few feet awa3 r , but safe
from the threatening stone. The new site was just visible from
above, and by taking care I could peep into the nest. On Feb-
ruary 18th this appeared just ready for eggs as the lining of soft
material had been placed 011 the sticks. About two mouths later,
on April 12th, the nest contained three young birds, well fledged
but unable to fly. A Raven's nest on a cliff, is in my experience,
usually well hidden from above, but in this case only a steady head
was required to enable one to look straight down at the young
birds below, and my sister, who was with me, enjoyed the sight
as easity as I did. When the young Ravens heard us above they
raised their heads and opened their bills, showing large flesh-
coloured mouths, but on hearing the warning croaks of their
parents tlie3 r crouched down and remained perfecth&apos; still.
A few years ago, soon after we had first discovered this
nesting place, my brothers and I found the temptation to storm
the cliff too strong to resist. The date of attack was March

21st, and we thought that by that time the nest was sure to con-
tain eggs. A crowbar and rope were borrowed from a coasting
vessel lying at anchor hard by, and we proceeded to the assault.
The climber of the " Raven Tree " mentioned earlier, volunteered
for the descent, and so he was let down over the cliff until we on
the top received the signal that he had reached the nest. The
voice sounded strange coming up from the depths below, but we
could just catch the words "3&apos;oung birds," which to enthusiastic
egg collectors meant disappointment. However, when the
climber had reached the top of the cliff we found that he had
not returned without some trophy. The nest he said contained
four young birds apparently only a few da}^s old, but among
these were two stale eggs which had not been hatched out, and
these we still have to remind us of the adventure.
Many pleasant holiday hours may be spent watching these
noble birds at their ancestral strongholds on the wild cliffs above
the sea. The power of their flight is very remarkable, and I
have seen them soaring up into the air in spiral circles with
almost motionless wings, until they were lost to sight. But even
the hardy strong-winged Raven is sometimes severely buffeted
by the fierce winds, and a bold bird indeed must he be, to dare
to rear his brood on the wild sea cliffs before the March gales
have spent their force. I have watched the birds through my
glasses struggling inch by inch to reach their nest against a gale
of wind, and could see by their wide-open bills that the task was
taxing their powers to the utmost.
The cock Raven, when at his nesting haunt, may often
be seen performing curious antics in the air. He will suddenly
half close his wings, throw himself on his back and drop down-
wards for some distance before turning over again and recovering
his balance. This strange performance is usually accompanied
by low guttural croaks sounding rather like a hoarse laugh,
which is very different from the harsh croak of alarm. It may
have some connection with the " shewing-off" displays common
to the cock birds of many species during the mating season, but
it must bear some other meaning as well, as I have often seen these
tumbles and somersaults performed while the young have been in
the nest. L,ike the frantic divings and twistings of the male

Peewit, these gambols of the cock Raven are probably practised
with the intention of diverting the intruder's attention from the
nest and young.
Fascinating and intelligent as the Raven is in captivity,
there are few naturalists who would not rather see him in a wild
and natural state. His boldness and cunning enable him to take
pretty good care of himself, and he knows very well how close
he may approach to a dangerous looking object. I have some-
times sat down on the cliffs above a nest and seen the old birds
perched on a rock close at hand and eyeing me narrowly, but a
very slight movement on my part would soon send them, croaking
out of harm's way. These birds probably keep to certain favourite
rocks when devouring their prey, or at least when digesting it,
as numbers of tlirown-up pellets of fur and small bones may be
found in certain spots near the nest.
I will end these notes of some of my rambles among the
Ravens' haunts with the account of an incident I once wit-
nessed, and which is probably of frequent occurrence on the rocky
cliffs where the Raven has only the Peregrine Falcon as a rival for
the mastery of the air. The account is copied straight from my
notes which were scribbled down some six years ago, at the time
when I saw the incident, and the reader must pardon me if my
knowledge of the terms used in falconry has been at fault. It
runs thus: "April 2nd, 1899. The Ravens and Peregrines at
Baggy Point were apparently nesting near to one another. The
Ravens' nest we found on March 28th on a steep precipice at the
end of the Point, facing W. O11 that day we only saw one of the
Ravens and both the Falcons. On April 2nd we saw both the
Ravens, who were very anxious about their nest, and continually
flew over our heads uttering harsh croaks. The nest almost
certainly contained young birds. Every now and then one of
the Peregrines, from its size probably the tiercel, appeared above
the cliff, and then followed a series of tussels between Falcon
and Ravens. The Peregrine towered above one of the Ravens
and "waiting on" till he saw his opportunity, suddenly
" stooped " at him, but never appeared actually to strike him.
As soon as the Falcon " stooped" the Raven turned on his back
in mid-air, and presented beak and claw at the Falcon, uttering

harsh croaks. The Peregrine always " checked" when about a
foot from the Raven, and with incredible speed again " mounted
to his pitch" and repeated the performance. This was done
over and over again, and as the Peregrine never touched a feather
of the Raven's, the object was apparently to drive him away
from the vicinity of his nest. As however the performance took
place before or above the very cliff on which the Ravens' nest
was placed, I think that either the Peregrines and Ravens were
nesting in close proximity, or that these aerial gambols were not
performed through any unfriendly spirit."

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., F.E.S., F.Z.S., etc.
In 1903 our Editor had the great satisfaction of breeding
Turnix ianki in his aviaries, and thereby was enabled to throw
considerable light upon the life-history of the Hemipodes.
Recently, while looking through Dr. Karl Russ' " Weich-
futterfresser," forming the second but last published volume of
his large work--" Die fremdlandischen Stubeuvogel," I came
across very full accounts of the breeding of two species of
Turnix in Germany-- T. nigricollis and T. lepurana ; and, as I
felt sure that a perusal of these accounts would be of considerable
interest to English students, I consulted with our Editor,
who expressed a desire that they should be detailed in our
Magazine. *
Dr. Russ' works are by no means the easiest of German
writings to translate ; not only because he uses words not to be
found in most dictionaries, but is addicted to abbreviations and
word-clippings. I believe I have elsewhere pointed out with
what difficulty I discovered (no German to whom I applied could
tell me) that the word spiizsat, often used in his books, was an
abbreviation of spitzsaat, and stood for canary-seed : well, that
is only one word, though unhappily not ke only one. Most
I propose to reserve the account of T. lepurana for a later paper.

Dr. A. G. Butlejk,
abbreviations one is familiar with, and others one can guess at ;
but the punctuation is the most perplexing item; where a full
stop is used instead of a comma, semi-colon, or colon; and
invariably followed by a capital letter : so that one paragraph is
broken up into a number of asthmatic gasps.
Lastly, there is a difficulty in the accounts of these
Hemipodes which is not peculiar to German writers, but occurs
sometimes in papers by our own countrymen ; that is--the
frequent abrupt change from the past tense to the present, and
back again, together with an occasional lack of definition in
stating whether the writer is referring to the parent or the
young ; so that it is necessary to decide the point by considering
the context.
In translating, I have thought it better not always to
follow these confusing lines, but represent the intention rather
than the exact wording of the authors from whose writings Dr.
Russ has compiled his account: indeed, a literal translation of
German as it stands, would sound strange to English ears ; the
order of the words, and the breaking up of the verbs being
essentially dissimilar to ours.
Somewhere about the year 1890, as far as my memory goes,
the late Mr. J. Abrahams received several examples of Turnix
nigricollis, which found their way into the hands of my former
colleague Mr. W. R. Ogilvie Grant. As he had no place ready
for them, he asked me to take care of these charming little
Hemipodes until he had constructed a suitable cage for them.
I had three of these for some weeks, and became
thoroughly enamoured of them : indeed it was with the deepest
regret that, after the completion of their cage, I had to restore
them to their owner.
It must have been somewhere about this date that the
German dealers received the consignments from which Lieut.
Hauth of Potsdam purchased his specimens, after which they
arrived in constantly increasing numbers in the German market,
until at length in 1895 Mr. Scliiffer of Cologne received no less
than forty pairs in one consignment.
First-Lieut. Hauth (says Russ) received his first pair in
February 1890. The Hemipodes, together with a pair of Painted

Quails, were placed in the bird-room in April. Whereas the
former selected the dark recess, the latter chose the lighter
position near to the window. *
" Both species retained these posts from that time
forwards ; yet later they made excursions as far as the middle of
the bird-room. Within their own territory they exhibited no
antagonism, but avoided each ' other without actual fighting.
After a few days they had settled down, consorted peaceably
one with another, as well as with all their other associates,--
Waxbills and Grassfinches : I never saw the Hemipodes do these
the slightest injury, nevertheless they never got rid of a certain
amount of nervousness ; the warning-cries of the finches were
listened for with strained attention, and their hiding-place
sought when danger threatened."
After three weeks Mr. Hauth had already found two eggs
among the rushes f in a flattish depression furnished with a few
grass-stems; and altogether the hen laid twelve, sometimes in
this place, sometimes elsewhere. Then the true nesting-fever
awakened for the first time :-- the hen strutted with long
strides over the whole territory from dawn to eve ; and frequently
and ever louder uttered its peculiar pairing note.
Contrary to the statements made respecting the wild life
of the Hemipodes, Mr. Hauth was able ... to observe that
the latter built a true nest.
From the building material usually provided for the
Ornamental Finches,--various kinds of fibre, moss, etc., several
completely over-arched nests were constructed. One of these
consisted entirely of moss; and a tunnel about twenty
centimetres in length with a round opening five centimetres
wide, led to the nesting depression about two centimetres in
breadth, wherein several eggs lay upon the sand. As the passage

one, to one and a half centimetres in length: these were
immediately utilized for a new nest.
" From my place of concealment," writes Mr. Hauth, "I
was able to watch the process exactly :--as always previously,
the female prepared a clear space on the ground for the nesting-
site, among the rush-stalks not far from the window. Standing
on one foot and scratching with the other, also twisting herself
in a circle she had witha few turns gained the desired width
between the rush-stalks.
Meanwhile the resounding pairing note and the gentle call-
note, sounding like kru, kru, had attracted the male; which now
crept as far as possible into the space with her, and also began to
twist and scratch. The hen now seized the stalks within reach
with her bill, and with a rapid lateral movement flung them
singly over herself, that is to say clear over her head on to her
back: then the male dragged them farther towards himself.
When enough stalks lay upon the back of the bird which
was in the nest, these were compacted by pressing upwards and
at the sides, fresh ones being constantly added, until by degrees
a complete enclosing arch was erected. Meanwhile, by turning
in the nest and arranging softer stems, the male had modelled
the nesting-hollow. The principal work fell to the lot of the
female. *
After she had driven the male out and slipped inside herself,
she next drew almost all the stems at the entrance hole together,
so that it was almost concealed ; thereby the building from the
outside appeared like a confused heap of stalks, though inside it
was well-formed (whereby doubtless it affords protection to the
little bird when in freedom). The latter crouched, stooping low
among the loose-lying stalks before the entrance which then
closed up of themselves behind her, so as to conceal the eggs and
brooding cock from sight. It is noteworthy that the male showed
himself extremely cautious every time he left the nest and
slipped in again."
In this nest the hen laid seven eggs, which however
were unfortunately deserted. She utterly destroyed the nest, and
At this point the tense suddenly changes in the German original, but I have thought it
better to continue in the past tense.--A. G. B.

constructed a new one in the same place, in which eight eggs
were laid. On the sixteenth day two chicks crept out, * of which
one soon died and was forwarded to me, the other throve well up
to the age of about six weeks ; then it wounded itself in the
head and back by nervously flapping about during its feeding in
an isolated cage, and died in consequence. The other six eggs
were neglected ; three were found, at the first glance, to have
died, three were infertile.
During the year 1S90 the female laid eight clutches ; but
young were only hatched from three of them. With Langheinz
also the Hemipodes built several nests before they accomplished
a satisfactory hatch :--a similar over-arclied (structure) was found
on the sand, with a tunnel of ribbon-grass and moss thirty
centimetres in length; and then this bird-keeper bred satis-
factorily several times ; as also Mr. Hautli did freely later on,
with Messrs. Behrens, Kemper, Krohrn, and others.
The observations of all these breeders essentially agree:
I enter into particulars here more especially from the records
of Mr. Hautli, which are the most detailed. The eggs differ
much in size, colour, and markings : they are proportionately
large (21-24, 4 c.m. x 18-19, 5 c.m.), glossy, smooth - shelled, and
delicately moulded; f with white, greenish - white, or rust-
brownish ground-tint, marked with small and large points,
spots and streaks of grey, brown, or black. The duration of
incubation takes 13 days.
The male sits and is guarded by the female : according to
Hauth's observation, exceptionally relieved by the female in
brooding; otherwise the male alone does this. In individual
cases and under special circumstances only the female brooded
with him, and also fed and led about the young.
As a rule, however, the little cock leads, warms, and feeds
the young; while the hen, particularly during the first days,
shows herself spiteful towards them ; so that it seems advisable
* From what follows it would seem that the cock must have begun to sit immediately
after the laying of the fourth egg, and the sixteen days are counted from the commence-
ment of the laying.--A. G. B.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
to remove lier as soon as the cock sits, or at any rate as soon as
the young have emerged, until they have become independent:
then, at the age of three to four weeks they must be caught out
and the old birds reunited.
Entrancing is Mr. Hauth's representation of the behaviour
of his first breeding-pair after the young were hatched : --
" The hen approached the little one; then the cock
rushed off with it to hide it under its feathers: or the hen ran
towards him in amicable fashion to frustrate his intention, and
then quickly back again to the chick, spreading its wings over
the latter. Clearly he had not much faith in her peaceful
intentions.
On the following day the hen ventured to approach quite
close, yet he continually strove to protect the chick. It was
most exciting when, on the third day, he led it towards the
female; whereupon the latter was palpably delighted and
welcomed it with gentle sounds and soft tremours ; still he could
not yet suffer the young one to w r arm itself under her, but
pecked it carefully and gently away.
After the expiration of about a week, the hen first led and
fed the young one with equal solicitude to that of the male.
From the first hour she was a pattern of love, attention, and
gentleness towards the little chick : she never let it out of her
sight, called it softly grue, grue, led it to the water and food, kept
it, at each step, close under her warm abdominal feathers. The
young one at first greatly needed the warmth; if it did not
obtain it immediately, it piped loud, and was not silent again
until it felt itself covered. When some days old its gentle piping
sounded like the twittering of several young tiny birds. I am
convinced that in the observation of such family life in birds
consists the greatest delight, and at the same time the best solace
for the manifold toil in our hobby.
The feeding up of the young differed during the first eight
days from that of other fowls, for instance from that of Quails.
Whereas these, from the first day of their existence, are capable
of picking their food from the ground unaided ; the male offers
the young Hemipode first an ant's egg, then a tiny seed which
it has seized with the point of its bill ; at the same time gently
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99729315" page_id="32656707"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">

calling and tremulously moving its tail, until the youngster,
becoming attentive, after much trying and many unsuccessful
pecks, at length picks it out and eats it. Of itself it never takes
the least thing from the ground : during the first days it sits a
good deal on its hinder parts, and in this extraordinary upright
position it also pecks at the food held in front of it. Even from
the first day it pecks into water.
Then he goes with rapid step to the place where loose
sand invites to a bath, the young one still as a little mouse close
behind him ; whereupon the young one being somewhat dis-
concerted watches the burrowing of the old one. After a few
seconds they again hurry off into the sheltering thicket.
So it goes on from dawn to eve ; their activity takes a
different direction every minute ; their pleasing movements and
positions change almost perpetually.
So long as the youngster was still quite small the female
walked close to it, especially in the vicinity of the nest, with
great strides, proudly erect and nodding in measured fashion,
exactly as if she were ready to try conclusions with every enemy.
Now the male Painted Quail was scarcely permitted to wink,
before she would run towards it with lowered bill, spread wings,
and bristling neck and back feathers ; still at the worst it
avoided the onslaught by getting out of the way, so that such
warlike exhibitions were of little consequence.
The cock was extremely gentle towards the tiny finches :--
Scarcely was the young Hemipode recognizable by its feeble
piping before nearly the entire commonwealth of the bird-room,
full of curiosity, hopped about and fluttered round the nest, sat
on all the twigs and on the ground, stretched their necks, flirted
their tails, and indulged in a long and lively conversation.
Indeed, the most intrepid Vinaceous Waxbills were daring
enough even to peep into the nest, so that they almost touched
the sitting male. The latter only protested by feeble pecking,
whereas a single stroke of the bill would have sufficed to put an
end to their existence.
In the second week the young Hemipode began now and
again to pick up a little food for itself from the ground ; in the
third week it ate almost unaided, was moreover little brooded,
but was still led about.

202 On Breeding Turnix nigricollis in German Bird-rooms.
The development of the young proceeds with just as rapid
grades as in the little Quails : even after two days they run quite
as quickly as a small mouse, and now and again preen their
sprouting feathers. In the second week the young plumage is
already clearly visible, the wings and tail are half grown. The
young hen has now acquired even the carriage and walk of the
old bird, begins to strike and swagger, frequently stoops and
conceals itself when there is an unfamiliar noise. At the com-
pletion of the third week it is full-feathered, more frequently
tests its power of flight, and would be able if necessary to make
its way in the world alone. In the fourth week the young
appear to separate from the old, since the cock chased the young
one whenever he caught sight of it, whereat the latter loudly
crying glicklicklick easily and adroitly flew upwards : it was not
hunted by the female. In size it was little behind the old birds.
I now took it out and placed it in a cage, wherein it soon
made itself at home and also became confiding; only when being
fed it still dashed itself nervously about."
Mr. Langheinz also says that the young require a good
deal of warmth, " so that they regularly burrow deep in moss
and soft hay. Even in the fifth week the old male took them
under his wings. At the end of the fourth week they extended
their attempts at flight as far as the ceiling of the bird-room."
Immediately after leaving the egg the young bird is
covered with thick fluffy little feathers.
Downy plumage :--Top of head and nape deep brown-
yellowisli ; on the middle of the crown is a narrow whitish
longitudinal stripe ; a similar one on each side of the forehead
above the eye to below the nape ; a black stripe from the middle
of the base of the upper mandible over the forehead and front of
the head to the middle of the crown ; region of the eyes and ears
whitish ; chin, gorget, and front of neck clear mouse-grey ; rest
of under surface fawn-brownish-grey; middle of back broadly
rust brownish, enclosed by black stripes and after these whitish
stripes ; sides of the back clear brownish-fawn-yellowisli-grey
with blackish spots ; wings hare-coloured ; shoulders, lower arm
and central bones of hand darker, more rust-brownish. Under-
side of wing fawn grey ; upper and lower shanks above with

dark,--below with paler hare-coloured downy feathers, and with
some blackish spots : bill short, with long nostrils, black-brown ;
feet three-toed, long, scaled, grey, with reddish delicate claws ;
eyes black ( Hauth ).
Dr. Russ also gives an account of the courting : but as it
seems to correspond very closely with the method adopted by
these birds in feeding the young, the hen offering a seed to the
cock, but uttering its pairing note instead of the soft nursing
call, I think it unnecessary to reproduce it in detail here.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.A., M.B.O.U., etc.
I feel sure that it will interest our members, and perhaps
cause some of them to break the 10th Commandment, when I
write to say that I have secured four Bourke's Parrakeets
{Neophema bourkei ) at Genoa. They are all in fine condition,
and I should say they are all from one nest. Being not as yet in
full colour it is difficult to declare their sex ; but perhaps there
are two males and two females. It would seem so ; for two have
smaller heads than the other two, and the lacings on the feathers
of the wing-coverts are less clear.
Should they all be of one brood it is a pity for breeding
purposes ; but one cannot have everything in this life, and it
seems to me that to receive in one day, four Bourke's, a fine pair
of Many-coloured Parrakeets, and a pair of
BEG I NTH A BICTA,
as well as another pair of rare Australian Finches, which I will
describe; is enough to satisfy a bird-lover for the time being:
not to mention a cock Gould's Finch, with a wonderful gamboge
yellow head instead of a red one. I11 this bird the green of the
back is lighter, I think, than the usual type. His yellow head
is, as I say, gamboge ; a different tint to the beautiful saffron
yellow breast. The delicate blush rose and forget-me-not blue

on the breasts and tail-coverts of the Bonrlce's Parrakeets is
most beautiful. They are apparently moulting, but extremely
brisk.
The AEgintha ( Emblema) picta, or Painted Finches, are a
pair ; but evidently, like the Bourkes, are not in full colour.
The cardinal red is as yet dull: but they are pretty little birds,
with their many white spots on the throat and breast. I do not
care for the expression of the eyes, which are straw-coloured.
Then, too, I secured two nice pairs of Australian Crimson
Finches {Phaeton&apos;).
The Finches that I have not seen before, so far as I can
remember, are Australian also. I should say they are of the
same family as the Chestnut Finch : they are just about the same
size, and style, and form : the tail especially so, being almost of
the same colour as in the Chestnut Finch. The thick bill is
bright grey ; the whole head and face and neck fawnish white ;
the upper parts, with the wings, uniform chestnut brown ; the
breast light cinnamon ; stomach fawn-white ; under-tail coverts
deep chestnut brown, almost black ; upper-tail covert cinnamon
fawn ; the tail much the same; the feathers of the thighs deep
chestnut brown ; legs and feet dark grey.* I forget whether
they are figured in Gould's " Birds of Australia," but I almost
fancy they are. Perhaps they are not so rarely imported as I
may think.
All these birds were lauded at Genoa yesterday, and the
bird-dealer, knowing the kind of birds I should like, most
courteously wired to me, and then sent his assistant with them
by train. I only regret that my health does not permit me to
rush off to Genoa (an hour by rail through endless tunnels) at a
moment's notice ; as the men who had brought the Bourkes etc:
from Australia were English, and they could have told me how
they obtained them, and whether they are all of one brood ; but
of that I feel fairly convinced. As it was they could not speak
Italian, and the bird-dealer at Genoa cannot speak English.
I have just looked at the Bourkes again before closing up
* Gould's Yellow-rumped Finch, Munia flaviprymna, of which a coloured plate is to
appear in this Magazine shortly. A short note of this rare bird appeared at page 53 of the
present volume. Mr. Hamlyn, the dealer, has just received (March 20th) no less than
eleven examples at least, four of which have gone to the London Zoo.-- Ed.

The magnificent work by Captain Shelley which is being
published by Mr. R. H. Porter under the above title, has now
reached its fourth volume, this latter being produced in two
parts, each a substantial volume in itself.
For the past thirty years the author has made a special
study of the African Ornis, and it is doubtful whether anyone
equally suited for the task of writing such a book could have
been found. The work, when completed, will rank as one of
the greatest ornithological works that has ever been produced.
Part I. consists of a systematic list of the birds which are
to be dealt with in the work, comprising the whole of the species
inhabiting the Ethiopian region, and these reach the high total
of two thousand five hundred and thirty-four species, and as
new species are constantly being discovered, it is probable that
by the time the work is completed, this list will be somewhat
extended.
Volume II. treats of the Sunbirds, White-eyes, Tits,
Wagtails and Pipits; Vol. III. of the Larks, Buntings, Finches,
Sparrows and such like; while part I. of Vol. IV. deals with the
African Weavers, Whydahs, Waxbills, etc. This volume will
be doubly welcomed by aviculturists, for many of the birds it
treats of are known to us at home in their living state.
It appears to us that had some of the interesting notes
which have from time to time appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, regarding the living birds, been quoted by the author,
the value of the book would have been enhanced : for the notes
on the life habits of birds made by collectors are few and far
between, and certain actions, notes, breeding-habits and so on,
can hardly be studied except where the birds are kept under
careful observation in aviaries.

With the advent of Spring the Zoological Gardens become
particularly attractive to lovers of animals, and especially to
aviculturists, for many of the inmates are turning their attention
to serious duties of nest-building and the rearing of theiryoung.
Even iu March, despite the frequent visitations of piercing winds
or winter-like sleet, the hardier birds commence to construct
their nests in earnest. In February the Griffon Vultures showed
unmistalceable signs that they wished to construct a nest, and it
was a curious sight to witness these ungainly creatures carrying
bits of stick, to the framework which Mr. Bertling, the head-
keeper, had fixed np for them. Bundles of sticks and twigs were
supplied, and in a short time the birds had collected together
enough to form a rude nest, and one egg was laid early in
March. A serious attempt was made by the birds to incubate,
but they ruined their chances of success by carrying up a bone
and breaking their egg with it. It is to be hoped that they will
make another attempt.
The Cape Eagle Owls have laid, but have eaten their
eggs, pieces of the shell being cast up with their pellets.
Several species of Doves and Pigeons are already showing
signs of nesting, and some are even now sitting.
In the October number of this journal, for last year, the
arrival of no less than five Birds of Paradise, in Mrs. Johnstone's
aviaries, was recorded, these consisting of two King Birds
(Cicinnurus reams&apos;), a Greater {Paradisea apoda), and two Lesser
(/*. minor). The two Kings were acquired by the Zoological
Society in October last, and have since occupied an aviary in the
Insect House, where they have done well. Quite recently the
three others have been placed on deposit at the Gardens, and
occupy other compartments in the same house; so that at the
present time there are no less than three species of these superb

birds on view together; such a collection as has never before
been seen in any European collection.
Mr. Bertling has had the good fortune to witness the
nuptial display of one of the Lesser Birds, which was very
different to that usually represented in mounted specimens and
illustrations. The wings were spread horizontally, and every
now and then appeared to quiver, while the plumes, instead of
being arched in two tufts, were spread together over the back
and tail.
Besides the Birds of Paradise, the very rare Black Lory, so
well figured by Mr. Gronvold in our last issue, is on deposit at the
Gardens, and is, so far as we are aware, the first specimen
exhibited alive in Europe. *
The Parrots in the very exposed Canal-bank Aviary have
mostly stood the winter well. We expected this of the Cockatoos
and Broad-tails, but few would have supposed that Macaws and
Amazons would have passed a trying winter in so bleak a
situation without apparently suffering any inconvenience. In
the centre compartment of the Western Aviary some Toucans
have existed without artificial warmth, and now appear to be in
the best of health. D. S-S.

CONGRESS.
Sir, --Most members of the Avicultural Society will by this time be
aware that ail International Congress of Ornithology is to be held in
London next June, and we hope to give our brother ornithologists from all
parts of the world a hearty welcome.
As time goes on it is being recognised more and more that many of
the greatest of Nature's problems are only to be solved by a study of the
living, and since England, so far as I am aware, is the only country that
contains a Society like ours, solely devoted to the study of live birds
exclusive of all domestic forms, I feel that our members should make a
special effort to show how much may be done by a careful study of wild
species in their living state.
* On going- to press we learn of the arrival at the Gardens of a pair of Bourke's
Parrakeets (Neophema bourhei), one of which has unfortunately died, and two pairs of
Yellow-rumped Finches [Minna flaviprymna).

In the Congress there is a special Section devoted to Aviculture, and
although this term will embrace domestic forms, such as poultry and
pigeons, yet I hope that a large number of members may not only attend
the Congress in person but communicate some papers on Aviculture proper,
in order that the possibilities and importance of careful observations on
living birds may be brought home to ornithologists in general.
Preliminary notices have been sent round to most of our members,
but I shall be happy to give any further information in my power to anyone
who will be good enough to communicate with me.

HABITS OF THE BHARDFD TIT.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998574806451613" page_id="32656714"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I was much interested with Mr. St. Quintiu'sobservation in the
March number of the Magazine respecting the habit of the Bearded Tit: --
" It makes a little jump forwards, and scuffles with both feet almost simul-
taneously, making the sand fly. The object evidently is to uncover morsels
of food." Of other Passerine birds which do this I have noted the Whydahs
(" Foreign Finches in Captivity," ist ed. p. 273) and the Song-Sparrows
("Foreign Bird-Keeping," part 1, p. 31). A. G. Buxr.ER.
Sir,--I was delighted to read Mr. W. H. St. Ouintin's account of his
Bearded-Tits, in the March issue of this Magazine. He is to be congratulated
on having succeeded so far.
I have often been told that these birds have several times been bred
by a gentleman living near London. If this lucky gentleman really exists,
he ought to publish his method, for the benefit of those who are less
fortunate.
The idea of breeding Bearded-Tits was a favourite one of mine long
before I tried it; my ideal aviary for them is not yet built, however.
Having lost twelve birds in three years through panic, wrong food,
and fighting, I considered that I had killed enough ; but since reading the
above-mentioned paper I have been on the look our for another pair.
The cock of my first pair lived with me about a year, by himself; the
last hen lived about the same time, and was found dead one morning, pro-
bably from a fit, or panic. The worst thing with these birds is, that they
will never take shelter in the covered part of the aviary. One pair were
beaten almost flat by a heavy rain storm in the night.
First I tried to get succinea and pupa for them, also the seeds of the
reed ; but never succeeded in finding any. I used to boil up some mixture
which the birds never went near. I fancied mealworms caused swollen
feet, so these were stopped. Canary-seed, soaked, the}&apos;would not eat. The
last birds were fed upon "Century Food," mixed with bread, biscuit, or
scraped carrot, maw seed, and crushed hemp being added occasionally.
They do not seem to care much for the "Century Food."

waggon pattern and placed in a sitting-room.
The aviary, facing north and south, is 15ft. long and 6ft. wide. The
north end is roofed with boards and iron, the three sides are boarded in;
the south side is open and has 4111s. of sand on the bottom. The open part
of the aviary is wired round and boarded to I4ins. from the bottom, and is
planted out with a few sapling trees. Several dead branches are fixed in
the ground for perches. There is grass, bramble, sedge, and a pond with
flags and reeds growing in it. The height is 6ft., but above the pond the
sides rise to 8ft.
During cage-life one pair, or a single bird, will live in good condition
if it is let out for a fly round the room now and again.
If two pairs are put into one cage the cocks will fight to the death.
On the last occasion, when I had taken away the beaten cock, which soon
died, the two hens started fighting quite as fiercely as the cocks had done,
until I separated them.

MONAD PHEASANTS.
Sir,--I should be much obliged if you could give me any information
respecting Monal Pheasants. Do you think they would do well here in
Nottinghamshire in a run open to the South and South-East,and protected
by shrubs 011 all other sides? Do they require any special treatment, or
would that required by a Golden Pheasant suffice ? Could you also give
me an idea of the price of a pair and where I could obtain them ?
Norman B. Roberts.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Roberts:
The accommodation you describe would suit Monal Pheasants well,
but they would require rather different treatment from the Golden species.
They are great diggers, and soon destroy turf and make their run very
untidy; thus it is necessary to take particular care that it is well-drained,
or it will get sloppy. They also require a constant supply of raw vegetable
food, apples, onions, and potatoes, cut up in pieces, and it is advisable to
give them insects or chopped cooked meat frequently also.
Of course these things are good for other Pheasants too ; but Monals
eat little grain when wild, feeding on grubs and roots, and thus especially
need them. Wheat seems to be the favourite grain with captive birds. I11
rearing the young, if you get any, pay particular attention to a supply of
insect food. See that they can get shelter from hot sun.
These birds are dear to buy --fxo a pair more or less--but none are
better worth the money. Mr. Jamracli or Messrs. Bailey, or Mr Castang
may have some. Frank Finn.

BATHILDA RUFICAUDA.
Sir,--A male Australian Red-tailed Finch, that I bought along with
the Gamboge-headed Gouldian finch, etc. is surely a type not usually seen.
Quite half of the crown of the head (if not more) is clear bright unspotted
red, from the bill.
The specimens I have hitherto possessed, have a few red feathers at
the base of the upper mandible (or maxilla), and all the rest of the forehead
and crown is green.
Is this a variety ? or a sport? There are indeed two of these birds,
but in the other (although also, I believe, a male) the red does not extend
quite so far. In No. I it extends, on the crown, beyond the eyes.
I always think the title of " Red-Tailed Finch" is inappropriate
because it is the red face which is far more conspicuous, and of a brighter
colour. * Hubert D. Asteey.

DURATION OF THE PERIOD OF INCUBATION.

<bodyText confidence="0.993639071428572" page_id="32656716"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- Our thanks are due to Dr. Butler for having collected together
so many facts on this most, interesting subject. His article, taken in con-
junction with Mr. W. Evans' papers in "The Ibis," covers a very wide field,
though I do not think we can take all Mr. Evans' conclusions as quite final,
as many of his results were obtained through the medium of the incubator,
or by the help of such birds as the Canary and Barbary Dove.
I find no record of any of the Spheniscifonnes among the birds
mentioned, so it may be of interest to record that Mr. Bernacchi in the
" Report on the Collections of Natural History of the .Southern Cross," (1902)
observed that the eggs of the Adelia Penguin (Pycoscelis adelice) " took
exactly thirty-one days to incubate" at the remarkably low temperature of
between 70* and 8o* Fahr.
At first sight the Penguins do not seem to be very likely birds to
breed in captivity, but I was much interested in watching a small flock of
what I think was the Black-footed Penguin (Spheniscus demersus) very busy
feeding some half-grown young in Paris in April 1903.
For the past four or five years I have always made a point of putting
down the date of laying and hatching of nearly every egg laid by my
Doves, and, as some of the results do not quite agree with Dr. Butler's
paper, they may be considered worth reproducing here.
I will preface my observations with the remark that perhaps I have
been placed in a better position than many aviculturists for knowing the
exact date of laying, owing to the necessity of my having to slint all my
birds up every night in the inner compartments shortly after dark (except
those hens which happen to have eggs or young in the open flights).
* We quite agree that the name of Rufous- or Red-tailed finch is inappropriate. Why
should not English aviculturists adopt the Australian name "Star Finch"? Individuals
vary markedly in the extent of the red colouring on the face.--E d.

In the above Table the 011I3 7 Barbary Dove's egg that took 16 da} 7 s to
hatch was under a pair of the little Cambaj&apos;an Dove ; 110 doubt they were
unable to keep such a large egg quite up to the normal temperature.
Most of the young hatched from the Barbary hens were different
sorts of Turtle-Dove hybrids, but 6 of the young were pure Barbary, 5 of
which hatched in 14 and one in 13 days, so I think we can say that this
bird takes from 13 to 15 days to incubate, by far the greater majority
hatching on the 14th day.
The Necklaced Doves were, I believe, a cross between Turtur
suratensis and T. tigrinus, but, as these two birds are so closely allied, one
would not expect them to differ in the period of incubation. I think 15
days must not be considered the normal time for the Cambayan Dove, as
in this case only one rather thin-shelled egg was laid, the young just
managed to hatch and then died: 13 or even 12 days I suspect would be
nearer.
Another point which has been neglected, owing to the difficulty 01
knowing when an egg is laid, is what length of time elapses between the
laying of the eggs of a clutch.
The general opinion seems to be that Barbary and other Doves lay
their two eggs on consecutive days. I have never found this to be so, one
day always elapsing between the laying of the two eggs
I have the following notes on this subject:

The reason why the Barbary, and doubtless some other Doves, are
commonly supposed to lay on successive days lies, I think, in the fact that
the first egg is laid in the afternoon about 5 o'clock, or later, and is thus
overlooked until the following morning. The second egg seems to follow
about 10 in the morning of the next day but one; so the conclusion is
drawn that the first egg was similarly laid the day before, thus apparently
some 41 hours must elapse between the laying of the two eggs in the case
of the Barbary Dove.
In conclusion, we shall always be liable to get conflicting accounts
as to the duration of incubation of the same species, as one bird may sit
closer than another, or the outside temperature may be hot or cold; and
we know, in the case of the domestic hen, that the freshness or otherwise of
the eggs has its etfect on the germ. * T. H. Newman.
THE ROCK GRASS-PARRAKEET.
In describing a visit to Rottuest Island, Western Australia, in the
January number of the Emu, Mr. F. Lawson gives the following interesting
note 011 the Rock Parrakeet (Neophema petrophila), a species closely allied
to, and which has very possibly been imported under the name of, the
Elegant Grass-Parrakeet ( N . elegans) :
"This pretty little species is fairly common, but seems to favour the
Western side of the Island, where it breeds on several small islets, and
occasionally on the most precipitous slopes of the mainland cliffs. For
a nesting site it takes advantage of any natural hollow in the limestone
rock. I examined half-a-dozen or more nests. All of these were on the
summits or slopes of islets, not in the face of the cliffs. The favourite
situation appeared to be under a large slab of rock over-hung by a profuse
growth of vegetation (Mesembryanthemum ). In one instance I found
young in down in a slight hollow in the sandy soil, simply concealed by
vegetation, and without other shelter. The eggs vary from four to six;
they are inclined to be spherical, and of the usual white colour. When
the nest is being examined, the old birds fly round with great rapidity, or
perch on a neighbouring rock, whence they exhibit great anxiety. Young
in first plumage lack the blue forehead band. In traversing the island I
often disturbed pairs or small parties of this Parrakeet, generally in the
more open parts. Their chief food seems to be small round seeds, but I
could not identify of what species of plant."
* On Feb. 22nd Mr. Newman sent me the above notes, and I asked him to publish
them in the Magazine. On the 23rd my white Barbary Dove, paired to Necklaced Dove,
went to nest at 5 p.m., and laid shortly afterwards. On the 24th she only left the nest
to feed, sitting close all day; soon after 10 a.m. on the 25th she left the nest and I
found a second egg had been laid. The cock then began to sit. One young was
hatched on March 10th, the other egg was clear. The previous hatching was probably
delayed by the cold weather.--A. G. Butler.

BIRD PRESERVATION IN NEW ZEALAND.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998908515151515" page_id="32656719"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
[The following note appears in the Emu for January 1905].
At the Sydney session of the A.O.U. Colonel Legge referred to the
interest taken by members of the Union in bird preservation, and spoke of
the lamentable extinction of interesting birds in New Zealand, such as the
Notomis, the Quail {Coturnix novce-sealandice), the Macquarie Island Rail,
one of the Cyanorhamphus genus of Parrakeets, &amp;c., &amp;c.
He alluded to the praiseworthy efforts of the New Zealand Govern-
ment to preserve other interesting endemic forms, such as Apteryx,
Ocydromus, &amp;c., in the "bird sanctuaries" of Resolution Island aud Little
Barrier Island.
The subject of the further preservation of these restricted New
Zealand forms was dwelt with by the Committee of the Biological Section
A.A.A.S., under Colonel Legge's presidency, and as the result he took the
opportunity, when in Wellington, of officially addressing Sir Joseph Ward,
in whose department the subject of bird preservation is dealt with, on the
preservation of the very interesting " Flightless Rail " of the Chatham
Islands (Cobalus modestus), which has become almost extinct from several
causes--clearing of low scrub, destruction of the rough pasturage by sheep,
and finall)&apos;by the ruthless onslaught of the fast-disappearing species by a
collector, on behalf, it is reported of the Tring Museum, when about 20
specimens were captured.
Colonel Legge's communication, written as president of the Biological
Section, A.A.A.S., was favourably received, aud he has recently received a
courteous letter of thanks from the Government of New Zealand for
having called attention to the matter, with a copy of the Gazette containing
a notice proclaiming the species as absolutely protected, and instructing
the magistrate to use every effort to preserve the Rail in future.
The only doubt is whether this bird is not already extinct. If so,
this will be another lamentable disappearance of a specialized New Zealand
form, which is all the more regrettable inasmuch as this Rail formed an
interesting link between the New Zealand aud Lord Howe Island avifauna,
and an interesting testimony to the former land-connection, in past
geological times, between the two localities.

the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply

Bullfinch (Miss Merrylees). Died immediately after a stranger handled
him and was always a very timid bird. He had been failing for the last
two months. [Your bird was suffering from pneumonia and no doubt
the handling when in his very weak condition caused death by heart
failure].
Madagascar Weaver (Mr. A. Cummings). [Apoplexy caused death].
Goldfinch (Mr. Moerschell). Fed on canary, thistle, and hemp meal,
lettuce, also summer rape and occasionally a little raw food. On two
occasions when ill a few drops of Parrish's Food were given. [Your
bird, like many other Goldfinches I have to examine, was much
emaciated, which seems to be a very common thing with these birds
when in confinement. Many of the best Goldfinches I have seen
have been fed on one part canary, one part maw seed, and three
parts hemp. I have kept many in perfect health on hemp seed only,
which is the usual treatment by many in Cornwall. I think you will
have better results if you give more nutritious food.
Parrot Finch (Mrs. Robertson). [Your bird died of fractured skull].
REDrump ParrakeeT (Miss Willatt). Was apparently quite well when
owner entered the aviary, but while birds were being fed he suddenly
dropped off a tree and died. [Apoplexy caused death].
Zebra Finch, hen. (The Hon. Mrs. Hodgson). Died suddenly when in
apparently good health. [Inflammation of the oviduct from retention
of a ruptured soft-slielled egg caused death].
Grey Parrot (Reginald B. Astley, Fsq.) Until about a week before
death it had been fed on boiled maize, but its owner decided to try it
on a parrot mixture. It never seemed to take to this properly, [The
bird died of exhaustion from want of sufficient and suitable food.
Emaciation was extreme, but every organ was free from disease].
Baya Weaver (Mr. Mark E. Rycroft). Had been ailing for five or six
days, appeared to get weaker, and flew with difficulty. It has been in
an unlieated outdoor aviary for three years and enjoyed good health.
[Bird died of inflammation of the liver caused probably from the cold
wet weather].

THE YELLOW-RUMPED FINCH.
Munia fLaviprymna (Gould).
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.

With the opening up of the more inaccessible parts of the
Australian Continent, the homes of some of the rarest birds are
invaded, and aviculturists on this side of the globe are given
an opportunity of keeping and studying species which were
never seen in a living state except by the most enterprising
explorers. It is not many years ago that Bathilda ruficauda and
Munia pedoralis were unknown to aviculturists in this country,
and the same might be said of Poephila acuticauda and P. per-
sonata, but at the present time all of these birds are common
occupants of the foreign-bird-lover's aviary.
The subject of the present article cannot yet be called
common, but the arrival of about a dozen examples in London
is an important event in the history of foreign-bird keeping,
considering that even the preserved skin was almost unknown
before.
The Yellow-rumped Munia was described by Gould in
1845, from a single specimen obtained by Dr. Bynoe during the
surveying-voyage of the " Beagle " in 1839. All he was able to
tell about the species was that " it is very nearly allied to the
Donacola \_Munia\ castaneithorax, but is specifically distinct from
that as well as from every known species of this now numerous
tribe of birds. I regret to add that nothing is known of its
habits or mode of life." It seems uncertain what became of the
type, but an example obtained in 1856, by Mr. J. R. Elsie, is the
sole representative of the species in the British Museum, and in

On the Yellow-rwnped Finch.
fact appears to have been the only specimen in the United King-
dom, until the arrival of the first living specimen in 1904, whose
history I shall presently relate.
Mr. Campbell, in his Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds
writes that since Gould's time " there is positively nothing to
record of its economy."
Elsie, who procured the British Museum specimen, pub-
lished a few notes on the species in the Proceedi&gt;igs of the Zoological
Society for 1856. He writes : " There are two Donacolas , flavi-
prymna and a crimson and brown one, of which there are one or
two varieties. The Donacolas build in some parts in low tea-
trees overhanging water, making a large spouted nest, with small
cavity, of dry bark of tea-trees and pandanus."
According to Mr. Campbell (1901) the eggs are as yet
undescribed.
In the early part of last year (1904) a few specimens of
Munia flaviprymna appear to have been trapped. A pair found
their way to the Melbourne Zoological Gardens, of which Mr.
D. Le Souef, the Director, wrote in the Emu for July 1904 (his
letter being dated March nth), that they were "just at present
busily constructing a bulky dome-shaped nest of grass. The male
is of a richer hue than the female. . . . They are altogether very
neat trim little birds in appearance, and seem fairly hardy. This
pair came from North-Western Australia, inland from Cossack."
Seven specimens arrived in Sydney about this time, and were
purchased by my friend, Mr. H. E. Peir, who sent one of them
to England to compete at the cage bird show at the Crystal
Palace. It appeared at the show held in October last, but
although it was almost certainly the first of its kind ever seen
alive in Europe, it was only awarded a second prize, as the Judge,
and many ethers who were present, took it for a hybrid, having
the Chestnut-breasted Munia ( Mcastaneithorax ) for one of its
parents.
This bird again appeared in January at the "Great
National" show where its rarity was recognised, and it was
awarded the special prize for the rarest bird in the show, as well
as first prize in its class.
I exhibited this specimen at a meeting of the British
Ornithologists' Club, on the 16th of November, 1904.

On Breeding Turnix lep nr ana in German Bird-rooms. 217
In the last number of this magazine the Rev. H. D. Astley
recorded the fact of his having secured a pair of these birds at
Genoa, from a ship bound for England. On, or about, the 19th
of March last this ship arrived in London, with a large consign-
ment of Australian birds, amongst which were some Bourlce's
Parrakeets and about a dozen specimens of the hitherto extremely
rare Munia fiaviprymna. So now this species can hardly be
called really rare any longer. Possibly ere long it will be as
common as Munia pectoralis , or even as Bathilda ruficauda.
I purchased a pair from this consignment, which I placed
in a very large cage with the original bird sent over last year. I
believe I have two cocks and one hen, but it is very difficult to
tell. There was very little difference in those I saw of the recent
arrivals, but only one of mine sings, and for a Munia he has
quite a respectable little song.
The call note is a pretty piping note, exactly like that
of its very near ally, the Chestnut-breasted Finch (. Mtmia
casta 71 eith or ax&apos;).
The bird-catcher who caught the original seven specimens
that went to Sydney last year, said that these birds "seem to be
kings amongst the Donacolas," going about with the Chestnut-
finch, and numbering about one to every thousand of the latter
species.

Respecting the successful breeding in captivity of the
Ferruginous-necked Hemipode (Lepurana Hemipode of the
Zoological Society's list) Dr. Russ informs us, that several pairs
were imported by G. Bosz of Cologne in 1892; and, scarcely six
weeks later both Lieut. Hautli and Herr Behrens had succeeded
in breeding with them.
The former gentleman, to whom Dr. Russ is indebted for
his account of the life-history of this species, was again success-
ful in subsequent years ; in 1895 he hatched out, from eggs laid

by two pairs, sixteen nestlings, of which twelve grew to maturity;
and again in 1896 reared twelve young.
In the following translation, where I have introduced
asterisks to indicate a hiatus, the missing words merely refer to a
previous page in Dr. Russ' book. This author commences the
account as follows :--
First-Lieutenant Hauth wrote to me :--" I cannot re-
member, during my many years experience in breeding, to have
attained in so unusually short a time, so rapid, decided, success-
ful and easily acquired a brood."
Of the best Hemipodes which reached him, he, on the
fifth day, placed two males and a female in the birdroom, after
he had removed the other little game-birds in order to induce
them to breed more quickly.
" They were extremely tame, confiding and sensible birds,
and without hesitation selected the clear vacant spaces, never
investigating the close coverts arranged with little trees and reed-
grass. They only made use of their wings if a violent sudden
scare alarmed them ; but when they had become completely
domiciled, they chiefly strove to meet the threatened danger by
crouching down : they were singularly more gentle and calm
than their relatives. They evidently felt comfortable in their
home.
The room was promenaded in active manner with graceful
movements, and a sand-bath was frequently taken . . . .; a titbit
resigned to the male by his mate, when summoned to her side
with gentle tender tones. In addition to the varieties of seed . .
. . they like shelled rice and husked millet; mealworms and
fresh ants' eggs are of course extremely welcome to them, as
also egg-food. They drink in the same manner as the Black-
necked Hemipode. In hot weather they delight to lie for a
considerable time in the dry sand ; sometimes also stretched at
full length in the wet sand at the bathing-place.
After two or three days the breeder had already observed
that one of the males was chased without malice if it approached
the two other birds : he took it out, and the remaining pair were
always affectionate to each other. The female seemed somewhat
more excited, yet not so boisterous as the Black-throated species

and frequently uttered its pairing cry. "The latter consists
merely of two long-drawn penetrating notes, and is frequently
repeated at short intervals ten or twelve times in succession.
The first note is pitched higher and is longer sustained, the
second note is about an octave deeper and rather shorter. By a
longer repetition of the cry it acquires added vigour towards the
finish ; although it proceeds from the closed bill it is yet audible
at a good distance, sounding muffled and hollow, the direction
whence it conies being difficult to determine. It is projected
with the same effort and similar delivery to that of the Black-
necked Hemipode ; moreover in preparation for it an unpleasing
gasping for air chacterizes it, and with each effort the sides of
the neck are blown out to a remarkable extent.
This cry is only peculiar to the female: as soon as she
utters it her mate approaches and pecks her coyly on the head
and back with amorous intent: thus they proceed for a consider-
able time until the pairing takes place, when the female crouches
flat upon the earth.
As soon as incubation begins, both old birds discontinue
these antics, and recommence them just before the next laying.
Sometimes the female utters a loud rattling, sometimes also a
growling cry, which seems to me to be intended to call her mate
to her. Even in the nesting-season the male continues almost
as placid and calm as ever: I only heard a soft ick from him
when the adults were in company, and an equally soft clucking
whenever he called the young together. When anxious he
utters loud cries sounding like tschugg ; and if he is alone he
gives voice to a loud rattling cry like the hen, but more by fits
and starts, and not so powerful and continuous.
The pair had scarcely been a week in the birdroom before
they had constructed their nest close to the entrance-door. When
they had been exposed to many kinds of interruption, Mr. Hauth
obviated this by repeatedly removing the building-material of
the nest. They now selected a vacant spot at the edge of the
reeds, and utilized all sorts of coarse and fine fibre and stalks,
showing the chief preference for slender dry straw-coloured
stalks. The nest was thick, with a large entrance-hole ; formed
with a high arch, so that the crouching, that is, brooding bird

Dr. A. G. Butler,
could be clearly seen. The process of nest building was carried
on in the same manner as with the Black-throated Hemipode,but
the old birds selected a different situation for it.
" They do not stand or crouch like the latter, but sink the
breast deep on the ground, and erect the hinder part of the body,
so that the tail is directed straight upwards similarly to that of
the doves ; like the latter also they simultaneously make short
tremulous movements with head and neck, whilst they peck
immediately in front of them in the sand or their own breast-
feathers ; at times also shuffling a little with tlieir wings and
uttering soft notes.
The female does her part more zealously and patiently:
the building of the nest continues sometimes for days, sometimes
only for hours. The fourth nest was not quite completed when
the first egg rested in it; it had been laid early--seven o'clock--
by the larger and more beautiful bird, while the male remained
near to it. On each of the three succeeding days an egg was
laid.
On each occassion I was present, and was able to note the
spasmodic movements of the bird, so that no question can exist
in respect to the identification of the sex. When the third, that
is the last egg but one, was laid, the male began to incubate
steadily. During the first days the hen also frequently sat for
some time on the clutch ; later she deputed the development of
the eggs almost entirely, and in the last daj^s altogether, to the
cock ; so that frequently they remained uncovered when the
latter had stood up in order to reach its food. Oil the eleventh
and twelfth days the male appeared to wish to discontinue in-
cubating. Rendered wise by similar indications in the Black-
necked Hemipode, I took away the hen, and, to my delight, the
cock went back again into the nest. On the thirteenth day all
four young hatched.
After about two days the male for the first time led out his
marvellously pretty little ones, and immediately brought them
fresh ants' eggs as food. The latter, as well as the adult birds,
corresponded exactly with the allied species in nature, action,
and deportment. Owing to the almost even greater trustfulness
of the little cock, I was able to watch and admire, in the closest

vicinity, the charming private family life of this little fowl ; the
latter is continuously busied in solicitous care for its tiny flock.
If I appeared at the door with living ants, bacon-beetles
and their larvae, which were accepted with remarkable pleasure,*
the old bird came hurrying up to and almost took them out of
my hand. At the beginning of the second week also, he led the
youngsters to the egg-food and seeds, as well as to the drinking
water.
On the third day a young one already began to pick up
ants' eggs unaided, on the fifth day they all did so, but the male
still continued to feed them freely. On the fourth day they
imitated the digging in the sand of the old bird and took the
most comical leaps in the air. The eggs again differ in this
species, even from the same hen: they vary from almost globular
to oval (20-25 x 16-19 mm.), are smooth and slightly glossy, with
whitish to grey ground-tint, fairly uniformly marked with larger
and smaller pale to dark brownish and blue-blackish spots and
dots, which generally become larger, darker, and denser, and
form a zone, towards the blunter extremity.
Downy plumage (at the age of three days, after Hauth) :--
" From the upper mandible to the middle of the head a narrow
red-brown longitudinal stripe; from this point the latter is
modified into two similar feebly curved stripes to the back of the
head, enclosing a broad fawn-yellowish white stripe : near the
aforementioned stripes on the crown 011 either side, a paler and a
darker one as far as the nape. Above and below the eye a fawn-
3&apos;ellowish longitudinal stripe. Five similarly arranged and
coloured longitudinal stripes on the back. Under surface greyish
white, bill brownish, darker on the upper half; feet strong and
flesh-coloured ; eyes brownish." By the second day the quills of
the wings break through ; 011 the fifth day the small plumage
sprouts; on the eighth day the wings already cover the back, and
the small plumage is fully developed ; only the head is still
covered with down.
At the age of ten days the young only require the warmth
of the old birds at night; but they no longer go into the nest;

Mr. E. M. Seth-Smith,
they new preen and poke about much in their plumage, burrow
in the sand, eat unaided, and delight to sit in the sun.
In the fourth week the breeder removed the young, and
they practised, according to their sex, their natural cry, which
the old birds, now reunited, frequently answered ; they also gave
utterance to sundry other more gentle notes.
In concluding these extracts from Dr. Russ' valuable work,
it may be interesting to note that T. lepurana, particularly in its
method of crouching with the hinder part of the body and tail
erect, more closely corresponds with what Mr. Seth-Smith has
told us about Turnix tanki than does the Black-necked or
Madagascar Hemipode.

A few notes on the birds to be seen in and around Entebbe
may be of interest to the members of the Avicultural Society.
Entebbe is the European headquarters of Uganda, and is situated
on the north coast of the Victoria Nyansa, about 32 0 30&apos; east of
Greenwich, and about three or four miles north of the Equator.
Birds are very numerous, and we have besides the
numerous very beautiful birds, many very fine songsters. On
the lake itself there are Divers and Darters innumerable, also
Gulls, and perhaps the grandest bird to be seen here, the Fish
Eagle. This bird is protected, as are several others, viz., Vul-
tures, numbers of which flock down to the meat market in the
evenings ; Egrets, of which there are at least two kinds, one
keeping amongst the reeds on the lake shore, and the other often
to be seen in large flocks following grazing cattle and picking off
the ticks.
The Whale-headed Stork (Balceniceps rex), is to be found in
a swamp a few miles from Entebbe, but very shy and hardly ever
seen; the Saddle - billed Stork (Xenorhynchus senegalensis) not
found very near here, and a beautiful Crowned Crane, often to be
seen in flocks of from fifteen to twenty.
To mention some of the most beautiful birds, we must
begin with the lovely Sun Birds. There are several species of

these, all resplendent with their metallic purples, greens,
blues, etc. glittering in the sun. Unlike the true Humming
Birds, this family seems always to suck the honey while settled,
although they may often be seen hovering in the air, probably
to catch some minute insect.
Then we come to the Bee-eaters, of which there are
at least two species, one much smaller than the other. In fact,
the smaller one seems to a large extent to have now (January)
taken the place of the larger one, which was extremely common
three or four months ago.
We have also several species of Weaver birds : the com-
monest ( Hyphantornis abyssinicus ), being a bright yellow bird
with black head. The bird is exceedingly common around the
lake shore, and on one tree twenty or thirty nests may be seen.
A few days ago (Jan. 14th) I was interested in watching
some of these birds busily building new nests in a colony, if one
may so call a group of their nests ; and after watching for some
time I went and examined the nests, in several of which were
eggs, but in one were two young birds just ready to leave the
nest.
In spite of their brilliant yellow colour these birds are not
easy to distinguish at a little distance, being exactly the same
colour as the flowers of the tree they nest in.
Then we have a black Whydah ( Urobrachya phoenicea ) with
orange upper wing coverts. These birds always seem to keep
in flocks, several cocks, say ten or more, to about four times as
many hens.
The Kingfishers again are most beautiful. The commonest
of all is a black and white speckled bird which frequents the
lake and feeds probably entirely on fish. Another common one
(.Halcyon cya?io!eucus) is a lovely bird, with bright blue back,
wings and tail, black shoulders, grey breast, neck, and head, and
a bright-red bill. This bird is, I think, entirely insectivorous,
and though they are sometimes to be seen beside the lake, I have
never yet seen them touch the water. There is also a very
small species about 4 inches long, with dark blue back, tail, and
top of head, salmony breast and abdomen ; and I have also, on
several occasions, seen a very large kind.

On Bird Notes fro7ii Uganda.
Still keeping to bright coloured birds, we have two lovely
Touracous. the Large Blue Touracou being the commonest.
This bird may be seen in any of the forests around Entebbe,
always several together. The last one I shot (on Jan. 13th)
proved to be a female with an egg just ready to be laid, and now
I am particularly anxious to find their nests, which I imagine
are high up and in the middle of the forest, especially after read-
ing Mrs. Johnstone's most interesting account of the nesting of
Fraser's Touracou in the November number of the Magazine for
last year.
Songsters are numerous, but are mainly Warblers, which
are very shy and keep either in the long grass or forest, making
it almost impossible, without a lot of time to spare (which I
regret to say I have not got) to identify, or even to catch a
glimpse of them.
The commonest, and perhaps finest, songster, however, is
a Chat (Thavmolcea arnotti) a black bird with white shoulders,
which are entirely hidden except when the bird is flyin g. The
hen is dark brown all over. These birds frequent the ant hills,
flying from one to another, although they may often be seen at
the top of trees in the open.
Pigeons and Doves are fairly well represented. One
common one, which we call the Green Pigeon ( Vinago calva), is
wonderfully protected by its colour. You may see three or four,
or even a dozen, fly into a tree, and not a densely foliaged one
either, but when you get there, not one is to be seen. They
see you and keep absolutely still, knowing perfectly well that
their colour harmonises exactly with the foliage. Suddenly
out fly several at a tremendous pace in the opposite direction,
and it is practically impossible to get a shot in ; if you do you are
certain to miss.
It is quite impossible to mention all the birds to be seen
here in a short account, but mention must be made of the
Finches, which are well represented. The pretty Cordon Bleu is
very common, hopping about back yards and in the roads, in
company with Firefinches.
Grey Parrots are very common, but these are usually seen
flying high overhead. Only once have I yet come across them

hearing the continual falling of twigs ; the birds themselves
being quite silent except when flying from one branch to

THE AVIARY AND ITS MANAGEMENT.
Extracts from an Address given by Dr. J. G. My can to the Sheffield and
District Cage Bird Society , February md, 1905.
Printed by the Author&apos;s permission.
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,--I have not come here this
evening with the object of criticising the action of those who keep their
birds in suitable sized and comfortable cages, but rather with the idea of
helping those who might be persuaded to prefer housing their pets
(especially the Foreign birds) in a moderate sized outdoor aviary.
Now, the first thing the aviculturist has to consider is the position of
the aviary, and so to construct it as to make his pets as comfortable as
possible and help them to lead healthy lives. With reference to the position
it is important that the front should face South if at all possible, and in
that case the entrance doorway could easily face East.
The foundation of the building should be of concrete or asphalt, and
the floor of the wooden shelter or sleeping compartment should be raised
one foot to a foot and a half from the ground. The whole structure should
occupy a space of at least 8 feet by 12 feet. Half of the building should be
for the bird house and the other half used as a flight. The bird house can
have its front, two sides, roof and floor made of wood, and its back should, if
possible, be at the back part of the kitchen wall where there is a fireplace
with a good flue, as by this means extra heat is obtained; and this wall, as I
will show you later on, can be admirably utilised for heating and ventilating
purposes.
The inside woodwork ought to be covered with medicated felting, and
this in turn should be lined with match-boards closely put together. To
complete the aviary it should be provided with a porch and double doors,
the inner one being covered with galvanized wire netting of 5 in. mesh.
All doors should have simple spring attachments to enable them to be self-
closing and then there would be less chance of birds escaping accidentally.
The walls of the building should be distempered (Hall's washable
distemper is the best), cream for the top and a very light green or some other
suitable colour for the side walls. The wooden roof can be covered with
slates or felting, if the latter, it should be well-tarred ; glass or metal roofs
are objectionable. The floor should be covered with zinc or good stout
polished linoleum, the latter I prefer as it can be easily cleaned and is both
warmer and cheaper. By having patent wired glass over the outer door-

Dr. J. G. Mylan,
way and on the whole front of the wooden house at its upper half, such an
aviary would be efficiently lighted. Glass panels could also be let into the
outer door.
The inside of house portion should be well provided with shelves.
One shelf, which should be from 12 to 14 inches wide, to run the whole
length of the front of the building immediately under the glazed portion,
this being to put seed hoppers, etc., on; other shelves, about six inches
wide, being made to go round the house; and on these nest boxes could be
placed and in case any of the young birds fell out of the nests, they would
thus be prevented from falling upon the floor and injuring themselves.
The shelves should be made of pine and resting on metal brackets, so that
they can be taken off once a week and thoroughly cleaned.
The perches should be plentiful and as near an imitation or
branches and twigs as possible and of different sizes to suit the various
sized birds in the aviary ; pea sticks and branches of fir trees answer well
for such purpose.
Water for drinking ought to be kept in glass fountains (the lecturer
favouring "Jones' Hygienic Fountain," and " Rudd's Globe Fountain" with
china tray and stand). It is necessary that all drinking vessels should be of
glass or porcelain, as if metal receptacles be used the water is liable to
become impure, and if medicines are mixed in such vessels the little pets
might easily get poisoned. Suitable baths should be provided. Self-feeding
hoppers of metal are the best and they should have several divisions, so
that the various seeds can be kept seperate; it is strongly advisable to have
a rack or two to contain cuttle fish bone, also to give a good supply of sea
and, crushed egg shells, crushed mortar; a few lumps of rock salt should
also be provided as this is a great aid to digestion for the birds.
Nest boxes, if of wood, should be made of pine, but in all cases these
should be ventilated at the bottom. In the case of foreign birds, rush
nests, cocoanut husks, nests shaped like logs of wood, etc., should be hung
to meet their little fancies.
The bottom of the house portion of aviary to be thickly covered with
pine wood sawdust; which is both cheap and antiseptic, and this should be
raked over every day and changed at least once every fortnight.
Now, we come to the other half of the aviary, namely the flight;
this portion should be covered with galvanized wire of \ inch mesh, and a
foot or more in height from the bottom should be boarded upon the inside
to prevent vermin, etc., entering. A woodeu shutter shelf (opening out-
wards) ought to be fixed in the front portion of the house so as to enable
the birds to go into the flight when allowed. The flight floor to be covered
with coarse gravel, which should be raked over regularly. Round the
inside of the flight there could be placed a boxed-in bit of earth, and on
this could be sown grass seed, chickweed, groundsel, etc., for the use of
the birds ; also you can place in pots, Box, Cypress, Spruce, Firs and

Eucalyptus trees about five or six feet high (the latter could with advantage
be kept in the house portion during the winter months).
And, now Sir, I come to the most important subject matter of my
discourse. Many persons could devise and build a bird house such as I
have described, but, few indeed, I am afraid, would give much thought to
the ventilation. Unless, gentlemen, you can devise some means whereby
you can arrange for a continuous inlet supply of fresh air and an outlet for
the foul air from y&apos;our bird room the lives of your little pets would indeed
be short and far from healthy.
Efficient ventilation can be accomplished by admitting fresh air
through an improved cast-iron Venetian inlet ventilator fixed about three
feet from the floor in the outer wall of the aviary, which brings in an ample
supply of fresh air; and the foul air can be extracted through a special
noiseless mica-flap ventilator (Boyle's patent) connected at the highest
convenient point of the inner wall to the chimney flue of your kitchen and
so arranged to have a steady up-current; both of these ventilators should
be fitted with valves so that the supply&apos; of fresh air and the outlet of foul
air can be regulated to any requirements.
As regards heating your bird house, this, in my opinion, can be best
done by hot water pipes; oil or gas lamp arrangements are highly objection-
able, as they absorb the oxygen from the air in the bird room and thus
complicate your plans for efficient ventilation. Your bird room can be
heated both economically&apos; and efficiently by&apos; a small low pressure hot water
apparatus. Along the inner wall of brick you can run two rows of 2 inch
wrought iron piping and connect these with a X inch flow and return pipe
to a U-shaped pipe at the back of the kitchen fire; a sharp circulation of
the water in the pipes is thus maintained without any extra cost for fuel
and the aviary is kept well heated without any additional labour or expense
after once being fixed. The U-shaped pipe at the back of the fire ought
to be coupled up with malleable iron unions, so that during the summer
months when no heat is required in the aviary this pipe can be detached
and put away&apos;.
Both the heating and ventilating apparatus in my aviary were fixed
by&apos; Mr. Alfred Grindrod (of Stanley Sheen &amp; Co., Surrey Street, Sheffield),
to whom I am indebted for the loan of the specimen ventilators which I
have shewn you this evening.
Such disinfectants as Izal, Sylvan Pine or Jeyes' Sanitary&apos; Fluid
could be used for washing shelves, perches, etc. When new birds are
bought they should not be admitted into the aviary direct; but should
be kept in quarantine for at least one week, and if at the expiration of that
time they are proved to be healthy they can then be admitted to the aviary&apos;.
Unless y&apos;ou exercise this care your healthy birds could easily contract such
diseases as typhoid, consumption and diphtheria. You should also guard
against overcrowding in your aviaries, for overcrowding is not only a

hindrance to successful breeding but detrimental to the health and
happiness of your birds.
If you are troubled with egg binding, get a small hypodermic syringe,
such as I have here, and which can be purchased at any chemist's for 2/6, and
fill it with about 5 drops of castor oil, and after warming the nozzle of same
insert it in the bird's vent and inject the oil, and, in addition, put one drop
direct into the bird's beak and apply a hot sponge to the vent outside and
this will be found to give immediate relief.
For birds down in condition and requiring building up, I have found
nothing better than half-a-teaspoonful of Allen &amp; Hanbury's "Hyno-
phosphates " mixed with their drinking water, to be given daily for about a
fortnight.

The renovation of, and additions to the Parrot house are
nearing completion, and the Parrots are now back in their
old quarters. So much has been done to the old house that it
seems almost a pity that, while they were about it, the Council
did not see their way to erect an entirely new building of some-
what larger dimensions. The roof has been entirely renewed,
and a good system of ventilation has been instituted, but we are
inclined to think that the great addition of glass in the roof is a
mistake, for as a rule, birds do not do well under much glass ; the
temperature is too variable, and the direct rays of the sun are
disliked by almost all Parrots, which, in a wild state remain
concealed amongst the foliage during the heat of the day.
The addition of a range of small aviaries on the south side
of this house is an immense improvement, and it is hoped that
some of the Parrakeets will breed in these.
A fine pair of Pytelia (or Zonogastris ) citerior, a rare form
of P. melba, have been received on deposit, and placed in the
Insect House.
A great many of the birds are now nesting. On our last
visit a pair of Whistling Thrushes, one of which is of the ordinary
blue species (,Myiophoneus ccemileus&apos;) and the other Temmiuck's
(M. temmincki ) were nesting ; Barn Owls, Cape Eagle-Owls, and
Griffon Vultures, not to mention several kinds of Doves, were
sitting.
A fine new aviary is being erected on the site of the old

Gull Ponds, which is to be devoted chiefly to Gulls and Herons;
and another aviary, in which it is proposed to keep some of the
rarer British birds, Waders of many kinds, and Grebes, has just
been commenced to the north of the Lion House. This should
prove a most interesting aviary as it will be arranged so as to
imitate the natural surroundings of Waders and such like as
nearly as possible.
The Great, and one of the Lesser Birds of Paradise, have
shed their plumes, but the second Lesser bird is still (April
19th) perfect, and has recently been displaying in a wonderful
manner, every morning when the sun shines between 7.30 a.111.
and 9 a.111.
STRAY NOTES.
It is very desirable that as many of our members as possibly can will
join the International Ornithological Congress, which, as has been
previously announced, is to be held in London in June next, so that the
avicultural section may be well represented. It is the duty of aviculturists
to show the great importance of scientific aviculture, as a branch of
ornithology.
Mr. St. Ouintin writes on April 1st from the South of France : "This
seems to be a very late season for migrating birds, as compared with 1903
and 1904. We have only seen one Swallow (H. rnstica) and that on March
20th. Spotted Crakes have been plentifully killed by chasseurs in the
neighbouring marshes, and we have seen a few Hoopoes; but there has
been nothing like a ' rush ' yet."
Mr. J. G. Millais writes to the Field of April 8th : "I have always
been sceptical about "March Cuckoos," but have just been converted. O11
April 1st I heard a Cuckoo calling for some time in an oak tree in front of
Warnliam Court, Horsham, and both heard and saw another (or possibly the
same) on April 2nd. Now this bird the Warnliam gardeners assured me
had been calling all day on March 31st, and I see no reason to doubt their
statement. They all heard it, and remarked upon the unusually early
arrival of the bird."
Dr. vSclater kindly sends us a copy of the Bulletin of the French
Acclimatization Society, for March, 1905, iu which appears an interesting
paper by Mile. L. Reyen, on the rearing of Swallows, and other insectivorous
birds. This lady has been most successful iu rearing Swallows from the

kinds. Mile. Reyen speaks very highly as to the great value of spiders for
all kinds of insectivorous birds, a fact which has been pointed out several
times by Dr. A. G. Butler. A large number of Swallows that Mile. Reyeu has
reared and let fly, have returned, and for several summers have nested in
the same place.
The Rev. Hubert D. Astley writes, from the Italian Riviera : " Have
any Partridge Bronzewings (Geophaps scripta) arrived in England ? I have
obtained a pair in Genoa, and hear that there were two or three pairs
besides, and that they went on in the ship. At present mine are very shy
and squat very closely on the ground."
Geophaps scripta has been kept and bred at the London Zoo, years ago,
but is very rarely imported nowadays.
Miss M. D. Sharp, of Ringwood, Hants, makes the following kind
offer to our members:--"Having had my aviary thatched with Heather,
and a quantity left, I shall be pleased to send some to any members of the
Avicultural Society who may be glad of it for their Doves', and other nests.

REVIEW.
BRITISH BIRD LIFE. *
There are now so many works on British birds that no
excuse can be found for the ignorance on the subject that one so
constantly meets with ; and if the appearance of yet another
book will tend to enlighten the popular mind as to the habits of
our native birds, Mr. Westell will have earned the thanks of
bird-lovers generally.
There are one or two rather novel features about this book ;
in the first place the birds are arranged in alphabetical order, so
that after the Capercallie comes the Chaffinch, after the Kestrel
the Kingfisher, and so on. The Author appears to consider that
the only birds that are entitled to be called British are those
species which regularly breed with us; consequently such
familiar species as the Fieldfare and Redwing find no place in
* British Bird Life, by W. Percival Westell, M.B.O.U., F.R.H.S. With an Intro-
duction by the Rr. Hon, Sir Herbert Maxwell, Bart, London, T. Fisher Unwin.

his book. Then again, when one turns to the end of the book
for an index, there is none to be found, and one has to grope
about as best one can for the required information. We confess
that we cannot appreciate this new style.
The Author's aim is a most praiseworthy one, namely, " to
set out the good which birds do and the protection and preser-
vation they need; to show what a loss the country-side would
sustain without their joyous presence and voice ; their beauti-
fully-woven homesteads and delicately-painted eggs; their
winning ways and devotion to their young." We sincerely trust
that he is right when he tells us that "the day for wanton
shooting of birds is now fast passing away."
This book does not pretend to be a scientific treatise, but
especially appeals to children and novices in the study of British
birds ; it is pleasantly written, and the photographic illustrations
of nests and birds are very good, though the majority of pen-
and-ink drawings would have been better omitted.

<bodyText confidence="0.998371666666667" page_id="32656749"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I lately liad the opportunity of examining a small collection of
handbills which were the relics of a Norwegian lady who visited London in
1791 and spent a week here enjoying the sights of town. Only one has the
date but the others all evidently belong to the same period, and one is so
interesting to aviculturists that I have copied it out and give it verbatim at
the end of this communication.
The dated one was a playbill of a musical drama at Drury Lane ;
evidence that popular taste has not very much changed in a century. Then
there was the handbill of a Wonderful Magic Mirror, reminding one of
Earl's Court, and one of a Fortune Teller, proving the 18th century more
tolerant than the 20th.
But the one that interested me most was a handbill of the wonderful
attractions on view at Exeter 'Change (now Exeter Hall or near that spot),
and which formed the Zoological Gardens of that day. I think a com-
parison by the readers of this journal of the Past and the Present will
immensely amuse them. Think of the present Zoo. and the " Great Room "
of Exeter 'Change with one room wider, and one room over. Fancy, also,
an Elephant in a room, however large, and placed at the top of the house !

The epithet applied to the Pelicans is good--"stupendous,"--yet to an
age which used strong words to express insignificant situations and to
whom everything was vastly becoming and vastly entertaining it would not
seem incongruous. I see also that I have written myself above "immensely
amuse"--the same idea therefore but the fashion of words change. The
description given by the handbill is naive, and carries us back to a delight-
fully early period in the study of zoology, when the world was easily and
often charmed and delighted by discoveries of new animals and new
species. The freshness of things has passed away, we now fall back on the
study of sub-species. Then there is the mention of the taking of Belgrade
by Marshal Landohn. This fixes the date. The capture of the city took
place in 1789, and two years is about the time it would have taken for the
spoils of war to have travelled across Europe to England. The taking of
Belgrade takes us back to a forgotten war, one of the many conflicts
between Austria and Turkey, and Marshal Landohn, although now an
utterly forgotten soldier, was one who fought so well in the better
remembered Seven Years War that he earned the respect of his adversary
Frederick the Great.
And the Elephant also attracted in his day the affection of London
siglit-seers as Elephants have been accustomed to do ever since. This one
was, I believe, he who for a long time was the pet of London and whose
bones we still look upon at the College of Surgeons. How different his
voyage to that of one of his kind nowadays. Not on the deck of a
P. and O. spending three short weeks steaming through the Red Sea and
the Mediterranean, but boxed up 011 the "Rose Indiaman " under full sail,
or under bare poles rounding the stormy Cape.
Even in 1791, however, both Pelicans and Elephants had ceased to be
novelties, having been known from ancient times. It would not have
surprised any learned man of the time to hear that the Marshal had found
Pelicans in a garden of an Eastern town, or that a Warren Hastings had
sent home an Elephant as a present to his countrymen. But how different
was the case of the Kangaroos. It was only 21 years previousl}&apos;, in 1770,
that Captain Cook had seen them for the first time, and it was in 17S8, three
years before, that Captain Phillips, taking out the first batch of convicts to
Botany Bay, had been made first Governor of New South Wales, and now
returning in the good ship " Atlantic," he brings home these strange beasts,
the like of which he had never seen before, to gratify the curiosity of
learned and unlearned as well.
Yet a reduction of 6d. on the three nights was not enough, and the
grim horror of the Guillotine, which in 1791 was busily engaged in France
doing its fearful work, was thrown in, so that hesitating aviculturists and
zoologists might have an extra and irresitible inducement to plank down
their half-crowns.

THE RAIN QUAIL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991518285714286" page_id="32656752"  page_num="234" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Can you tell me how to treat the Rain Quail during the winter?
Having to take them out of the aviary about November, I have to keep
them in a cage until I get back to East Hoathly in the spring.
I have had the same experience for two years. As soon as they are
caged the cock tries to get rid of the hen by chasing her about and pecking
at her eyes and beak, preventing her breeding. Yet, when separated, the
lien mopes and dies, refusing to eat. The first time I put her in with two
young Painted Quail hens. Although they seemed fairly friendly towards
the hen Rain Quail, she died after about three weeks.
Last autumn I sent a pair up to Chiswick ; next day I had a letter
saving that the cock had damaged the hen. I wrote back, saying, if the
lien mopes away get somebody to kill her; which had to be done a few
weeks afterwards, although she had recovered her wounds, but would not
eat. I11 their natural habitat do the hens form societies or live with their
broods during winter? IT. L. Sich.
The folloiving reply has been sent to Mr. H. L. Sich :
I have always found Rain Quails perfectly hardy, and that they do
best if left out-of-doors all the year round, provided that their aviary is not
in too exposed a situation, and contains a dry shelter. They are some of
the most nervous of Quails, and dash themselves almost to pieces if
alarmed ; consequently it is advisable to disturb them as little as possible.
It is a good plan to cut the flight feathers of one wing when first intro-
ducing them into an aviary, to prevent them flying against the wire and
injuring themselves.
I have had no experience of Rain Quails in cages, and should imagine
that their great timidity would render them unsuited to so confined a
situation. D. SeTh-SmiTh.

Sir, --I think it will be impossible to adopt the name ' Star-finch ' for
this bird ; inasmuch as it was given to it in error, under the impression that
it was a Waxbill, Astrild or Estrilda. I hinted at this in ' Foreign Finches
in Captivity,' 2nd edition, p. 155, and ' Foreign Bird-keeping,' p. 47.
As 3'ou pointed out, the red on the face varies considerably in extent;
and as we cannot alter the Latin name to rufifrons or stelligera, it seems to
me far better that we should adhere to the translation of its Latin
appellation-- ruficauda, and continue to use the name by which it is
generally known in the British Isles. If we could transpose the trivial
names of Cyanospiza cyanea and Hypochoerci ultramarina there would, I
think, be a more obvious reason for the change, because the Indigo-finch is
blue, and the Ultramarine-finch indigo. A. G. Buteer.
[It is very desirable that the trivial names of birds should be literal
translations of the Latin appellations, where such names are appropriate; but
when inappropriate it appears to us best to adopt other names which suit
the birds better, or by which the various species are known in their native
lands.
The Australian colonists and bird catchers know this species as "Star-
finch," and English bird-dealers often follow them. Mr. Campbell, in his
Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, calls it the Red-faced Finch, a verv
appropriate name, but undesirable for English aviculturists as it has been
adopted for at least two other species.
Although the appellations Red- and Rufous-tailed have now been
proposed for a number of years, very few English aviculturists have
adopted them. The species is generally known as the " Ruficauda," or the

Sir,-- British Guiana is evidently not the only place where young
birds are liable to the attacks of these pests, for those of our members
who are readers of that most interesting and instructive journal " The
Emu" will doubtless remember, that Mr. H. C. Thompson, writing in the
April number for 1903, of the neighbourhood of Launceston (Tasmania),
found a nest of New Holland Honey-Eaters (Meliornis novce-hollandice j
containing three young a few days old, two of the young were affected, the
"maggots were just under the skin, with the larger end out and when touched
would draw themselves in." They were situated on the head, body and
legs, he " removed nine from one bird by pressing near where they were
situated. When removed the wounds discharged blood and a watery fluid."
The birds seemed quite healthy, though the one from which the maggots
were removed afterwards died, the other affected bird got allright. Later on

{Pachycephala glaucura) were found with the young in a similar state, in the
latter case one of the wretched young had eleven large maggots and
another one four. In each case one young one was free. Mr. Thompson
also mentioned that a nest of the introduced European Goldfinch ( Carduelis
carduelis) was also affected.
In the days when I kept a good many domestic pigeons, I remember
on at least one occasion noticing some larvae just inside the vent of a squab,
as far as I remember they were not smooth like ordinary maggots but
seemed more in rings, they T may perhaps also have had short liair-like
processes on the body. I attributed their presence to allowing the nest to
get foul. T. H. Newman.

PARRAKEETS HOLDING FOOD IN RIGHT FOOT.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.976703233333333" page_id="32656754"  page_num="236" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In our Magazine, Vol. 2, N.S., for 1903-4, at page 107, appeared
a most interesting article on the Ring-necked Parrakeet, by the Rev. H. P.
Edge. So interesting, indeed, that it first put the idea into my head of
getting a Ring-neck for a pet. In this paper the author states that he
never saw or heard of either of his birds using the right foot to hold food
and that it is most unusual for Parrots to do so. Well, I carefully
watched my first Ring-neck, which proved to be a hen, and, sure enough,
she alivays used the left foot. She was killed by a dog just when she was
getting very tame.
I wrote off for another bird, and received a beautiful cock. A few
days after I gave it a piece of biscuit, which, to my surprise, it took with
the right foot from its bill, and held it till it had picked off all it wanted.
Since then I have often fed it, audit has always been the right foot that was
used. It would be interesting to have the opinion of some experienced
Parrot-keepers on this subject. W. H. Workman.
[A Meyer's Parrot in our possession always holds its food in its right
foot.--E d.]
THE YELLOW-HEADED GOULDIAN FINCH.
Sir,-- I should like to know what naturalists think with regard to
such birds as my Orange (or rather gamboge) -headed Gouldian Finch.
I am sure that if you saw it, you would agree with me that is
apparently as distinct a variety as a red-head or a black-head. Has such a
variety been scheduled ?
It is said to be wild caught. The bird is a male in good condition
and beautiful colouring, and I see no reason whatever why it should change
its head colouring to red.
Mr. Phillipps suggested it might be a hybrid, which would moult
back to the usual colouring. But its colours are all so very pure and
distinct, and there is not the slightest trace or suggestion of red or black
feathers on the head.

It is a beautiful clear orange-yellow.
And why should black and red produce such a tint ?
I believe it to be as distinct, after its kind, as are the " Gouldiae" and
"Mirabilis." Hubert D. Asttey.
[The Yellow-headed phase of the Gouldian Finch, named by Dr.
Ramsey Poephila armitiana, can hardly be regarded as more than a rare
variety of P. mirabilis. Single examples appear to occur at extremely rare
intervals amongst the normally coloured birds, but it has never, we believe,
been discovered in any numbers.--E d.]
SEX OF BIRDS, &amp;c.
Sir,--I have a cock Liotlirix and hen Blue Robin in the same aviary.
Would they be at all likely to breed together ?
I L fmd it very difficult to sex Diamond Sparrows. Do the hens ever
hold their heads down and sing in the same ridiculous way the cocks do ?
Also I find it difficult to sex the Lavender Finches and Green Avadavats.
My Blue Thrush is singing well, but I have a Nightingale that will
not utter a note, and it is properly treated. My St. Helena Seed-eater hen,
that last year made a nice nest in a cigar box, now tries to build in a food
trough or anywhere. My Virginian Cardinal is sitting.
April 18 th, 1905. M. C. Hawke.
The following reply has been sent to the Hon. Mary C. Haivke:
It is not in the least likely that Sialia and Liotlirix would interbreed ;
our Robin and Hedge-Sparrow would stand a better chance, because more
alike in size, but it is not in the slighted degree probable that even these
would take pleasure in one another's society.
The hen Diamond-Sparrow has a pale pink narrow band across the
base of the beak next to the forehead, the cock has the beak entirely deep
crimson : the hens do not sing. Lavender Finches are more difficult to
sex, but, as a rule, the male has the abdomen and the thighs blacker than
the hen. The cock Green Avadavat is a brighter bird than the hen ; the
latter is greyer above and whiter below, lateral^' barred with smoky olive
on a white ground instead of black and white.
If the Nightingale is a hand-reared cock, it may never sing, and is
not likely ever to sing well; but are you sure that it is a cock bird ?

Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Pariot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young ones

the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE" of Dec. 4th

Parrot-rearing, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and

Neophema bourkei.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.B.O.U., etc.
To write much as yet about this most lovely member of
that most lovely group of Neophema, is difficult, for those that
I have the good fortune to possess have been with me a com-
paratively short time.
The genus Neophema is distinguished from other so-called
Grass-Parrakeets of Australia by having the four central tail
feathers of almost equal length ; whereas the Psephotus group--
of which the well-known Redrump Parrakeet, and the Many-
coloured are members, as well as the "Beautiful" and the
" Golden - shouldered," have the two central tail feathers
markedly longer than the rest.
Of the Neophema group, seven species are known, but all
lovers of these fascinating little Parrakeets live in hope of one
or two more yet being added--for who knows what treasures
may still be hidden in the interior of that vast continent from
which they come ?
Mr. Setli-Smith's charming work on the Parrakeets will
inform those who possess it about this group, but I might
perhaps remind our members that the known species are these:

i. The Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeet ( Neophema venusta&apos;).
ii. The Elegant Grass-Parrakeet (N. elegans).
iii. The Orange-bellied Grass-Parrakeet (N. chrysogastra&apos;).
iv. The Rock Grass-Parrakeet ( N. petrophila).
All these four bear a strong family likeness, the one to
the other.

Rev. H. D. Astley,
v. The Turquoisiue (N. pulchella).
vi. The Splendid Grass-Parrakeet (TV. splendida).
These two have a strong family resemblance.
And last but not least
vii. Bourke's Parrakeet (N. bourkei), which as regards colour-
ing is quite unlike any of its group.
In this respect, it stands by itself, having struck out an
original line of its own, and made one think more deeply of the
mysteries of creation. It is a very protective colouring too, fo'*
one can well believe that when this little parrakeet is running
amongst ripe grass on sunburnt soil, it would be most difficult to
see. Yet one knows that the most vividly coloured birds have a
marvellous power of concealing their colours amongst their
natural surroundings. But the power to select a particular
colouring is indeed marvellous.
To think that the Bourke's Parrakeet and the Splendid
Grass-Parrakeet have originally sprung from the same parent
stock, (for so I suppose it is), makes one sing one's Te deum with
renewed energ3 r ! The delicate forget-me-not blue and blush
rose on the Bourke's Parrakeet is to be seen not infrequently--
for how often the same Hand paints the same colours on
different portions of the great canvas of Nature--in the sky at
sunset. A few evenings ago I pointed to the sky and said,
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.6991164" page_id="32656770"  page_num="240" year="" vol="">
" Rook ! Bourke's Parrakeets ! " There were precisely the same
delicate blues and pinks--rose-coloured clouds floating on a pale
blue sky. Was it from that that these Parrakeets took their
lovely colours ?

The male bird has a pretty warbling song, somewhat after
the warble of a Budgerigar, but softer, with no shrill interludes,
and the call note is also like a Budgerigar's, but softer again.
Indeed, had I not had wiser and more learned people to
guide me, I should have thought that the Bourke's and the
Budgerigar were connected more closely than in merely being
grass-parrakeets. There are the same scaly-looking feathers on
the wings; the same manner of the male in sitting with his head
close to his mate's, and warbling for half-an-liour at a time ; the

same way, too, of rapid fluttering of wings with that whistling
sound, whilst they hold to a perch with their feet.
And these characteristics are not to be seen, as far as I
can tell, in other members of the genus, such as the Blue-
winged and the Turquoisine. The Bourke's can sit, like their
cousins, very still and solemn, but then all of a moment comes
in the resemblance to Budgerigars : and I have never seen my
Blue-winged Parrakeets act in that way, nor do I remember that
Turquoisiues do either. The Bourke's is the only member of the
genus that has the scaly feathers on the wings : the rest are all
green.
But of course it is sheer heresy to suggest that the Bourke
had anything to do with the Budgerigar in past ages, isn&apos;t it?
For all that, they do very often remind me of them : which gives
me the thought--Surely, sonieda}^, another member of the genus
Melopsittaats will be found.
I have had the good fortune to secure a female Bourke
after the arrival of the first four birds, one of which died of
pneumonia, so that I have been able to put one of the males
with this newer female, thus feeling assured that they are un-
related. Along with this female there was another, which, alas!
died the day after I bought it: quite a baby bird, in nestling
plumage, the whole head and upperparts an uniform dusty
brown, and the pink and blue on the underparts very faint
indeed : evidently a bird hatched later than my others.
But with this unrelated pair I hope for satisfactory results
in the shape of a family. They have moulted well, and the male
resembles my painting, or rather, I have tried to make my
painting resemble him ! and I should suppose that with another
moult his blue frontal band, and the blue on the shoulders, will
be brighter. It is a different blue to the upper and under tail-
coverts ; indeed, at the edge of the shoulders it inclines to
violet, when compared with the forget-me-not tint of the tail-
coverts.
That they are, when acclimatized, easy to keep in captivity
I can well believe ; being hardy, to judge from the account of
the pair kept some twenty years ago by Mr. Groom in Camden
Town--which pair I can well remember seeing--and easy, too,

like all grass-parrakeets, to feed; contented with canary seed
and plenty of flowering grasses, sow-thistle, chickweed, etc.
when in season.
Probably, too, they would nest in a large cage, if a suit-
able nesting-box or barrel be placed outside, with a hole through
which they could enter.
My birds are fond of dandelion flowers, and I also give
them sometimes a plant of young lettuce.
Let us hope later on I may be able to give an account of
their nesting.
As to the colouring of the sexes, whilst still in immature
plumage, I am a little at sea. The hen bird seems to me to have
the smaller and flatter head, with a whitish frontal band ; the
cock bird, a rounder head, with a blue frontal band, and before
this appears, that is, before they moult their nest-plumage, the
brown feathers on the crown of the male come fully to the cere
of the beak. About my unrelated pair, I am pretty sure ; but in
the other two birds, the one with the flatter head and broader
forehead and the whitish frontal band, has the pink on the breast
much brighter than the one with the rounder head and more
distinctly marked blue frontal band ; but this may mean that it
is merely an older bird, and more advanced in its change of
plumage. At any rate, one may take it that the female lacks the
blue frontal band, and is decidedly duller in her tints than the
male. I think, too, that the whitish feathers round the eyes and
about the face are more conspicuous in the female.
If, on some other occasion, I can furnish further notes on
this lovely and rare Parrakeet, most gladly will I do so.
P.S.--Since writing this article, my Parrakeets have moulted
more fully. The forehead of the male bird is blue;
whilst the female has no blue, but a very narrow whitish
band over the cere : her lacing on the wings is much
less defined.

Merula boulboul.
By Arthur G. Butter, Pli.D., F.E.S., F.Z.S., etc.
In his account of this Blackbird published in 1898 the late
Dr. Karl Russ observes :--
"Although it is tolerably common and is frequently kept
in cages by the Hindoos, it nevertheless counts as one of the
rarest foreign visitors to our market. It has only arrived once at
the Zoological Gardens of Eondon ; the catalogues of the others,
and even of the Amsterdam Gardens, do not include it. Only a
single time, to my knowledge, in the course of years, has it been
received in the trade, and then it was imported by Chas. Jamrach
of Rondou."
I believe it was in 1902 that our Member Mr. H. W. Harper
imported some hand-reared specimens of this species, one of
which was exhibited in our gardens (though not for the first time,
as inadvertently stated in Avic. Mag., N. S. Vol. I., p. 215) on July
16th, 1902 : it was previously recorded under its synonym of
Turdus poecilopterus. In 1903 Mr. Harper gave a specimen to our
Editor, and in 1904 he gave other examples to me and Mr.
W. T. Page.
My specimen was exhibited at the Crystal Palace late in
the y^ear 1903, and came into my hands on February 13th, 1904.
Until the winter was well over I kept it in a cage indoors; then,
as Mr. Allen Silver kindly took the trouble to obtain for me a
healthy hen Blackbird, I turned out the pair into my larger
garden aviary, in the hope that I should induce them to breed.
Mr. Seth-Smith made a similar attempt with his bird, but found
it somewhat aggressive towards other inhabitants of the aviarjq
and consequently deposited it in the Zoological Gardens.
During the whole of 1904, and up to the end of February
1905, my Grey-winged Ouzel amused himself by fighting a cock
Blackbird through the wirework of the aviary: the English bird
was evidently attracted by the hen, which it followed over the
outside of the structure, showing off and singing to her whenever
not occupied in battling with her quite indifferent husband, who

Dr. A. G. Butler,
never took the slightest notice of her, being only interested in
fighting his blacker relative.
Possibly, as these imported birds were hand-reared and
their song self-taught; as, moreover, my hen bird was extremely
wild, neither bird had any attractions for its companion ; in any
case the constant attendance of a lively cock English bird with a
very melodious song must have prejudiced the hen against the
dismal Gregorian dirge sung by the Indian bird.
After some little trouble we eventually captured and caged
the cock Blackbird : it was evidently unpaired, and had begun to
injure itself in its struggles to get at the Grey-wing: its removal
to a cage indoors left the latter free to attend to other matters,
and shortly afterwards, to my great astonishment, I discovered
that it had learned an excellent song closely resembling that of
our Song-Thrush, but with phrases from the songs of the Black-
bird and Wren interspersed ; and sometimes varied by the self-
taught dirge of the previous year. Mr. Seth-Smitli writes me
that his bird " sang splendidly last spring, and his song was
more like that of a Thrush than a Blackbird."
To one who has hand-reared Blackbirds where they were
unable to hear the wild song, it seems most curious that, after
singing the wretched travesty of music invented by itself, even
for one year, this Ouzel should become an accomplished musician:
it tends, I think, to prove that the Blackbirds must be as capable
of mimicry in song as I, some time since, discovered the Song-
Thruslx to be.
Since the Grey-wing has become musical the hen Blackbird
has become considerably tamer: whereas previously I only had
to enter the aviary for her to exhibit the wildest alarm, and fly
tempestuously from one end to the other, she now remains
quietly on the branch of a tree at a little higher level than my
head, as I pass down the path with the daily supply of food: the
Grey-wing, being hand-reared, is of course quite friendly and
watches for my coming.
Although two pairs of Blackbirds have settled in my
garden, my captives have hitherto shown no inclination to build,
but I do not yet despair. In the same aviary I have a pair of

Wonga-Wonga Pigeons and a pair of Bronze-wings ; but the
Blackbirds take little notice of these.
Captain W. Tweedie speaking of an example of the Grey-
winged Ouzel which he purchased in Kashmir (Avic. Mag., N. S.
Vol. II., p. 116) observes that "during the lovely 'winter' in
the North-West Provinces, which is warmer than any days we
have had this summer in England, the bird never sang a note
and seemed to feel the cold." For a bird found close to the
snow-line this seems very remarkable, and only shows how much
less satisfactory cage-life is than the comparative freedom of an
open-air aviary. My own bird has not only thoroughly enjoyed
himself in a tolerably exposed (though fairly large) aviary, this
winter, but has bathed in the coldest weather, even when I have
had to remove the ice from the pan to enable him to do so. *
Unless my male is abnormal, Jerdon's description of Menila
boulboiil is a very poor one; he describes it as having "a large
wing-spot formed by the outer webs of the middle quills, and the
greater wing-coverts, pale silvery ashy-grey " : my bird has what
fanciers would call a " laced " wing, the feathers being broadly
bordered with pale buffish ash so far as I can tell without catch-
ing and closely examining it; Dr. Russ however describes the
wings as having the mantle and greater coverts yellowish-
brownish white, the latter narrowly bordered with black: in
either case the pale patch would not be uniform, but " laced" iu
character, f
Jerdon observes "The Grey-winged Blackbird is found
throughout the whole extent of the Himalayas, keeping generally
to an elevation from 5,000 to 8,000 feet. It is tolerably common,
but rather shy, and does not show itself in the open or in gardens
so much as the Neilgherry Blackbird ; and its song is, I think,
hardly equal to that of the Neilgherry bird. I obtained the nest
at Darjeeling, made of twigs, roots, and moss, and with three or
four eggs of a pale blue-green, with numerous light brown
spots."
* The Bronze-wing Pigeons (Pkaps chalcopiera) have done the same. The aviary
measures 22 feet by 9 feet 6 inches, and 14 feet to the ridge.
+ Further examination of my bird shows the median and greater coverts to be
buffish ash, bordered with ashy white, or a distinctly whiter tint of buffish ash.

Dr. A. G. Butler,
In his " Hand-book of the Management of Animals in
captivity in Lower Bengal " Mr. Ram Bramha Sanyal, the
Superintendent of the Calcutta Zoological Gardens, averages the
duration of this bird's life in captivity at three years; but I
should judge that the great heat in Calcutta would tend to shorten
the life of a bird coming from the snow-line of the Himalayas,
and that in our climate it would probably live to a much greater
age if properly looked after.
In Oates' edition of Allan O. Hume's " Nests and Eggs of
Indian Birds," Vol. II., pp. 93-95, is a very full account of the
nidification of this Blackbird, which would occupy too much
space to quote in full here ; but the following may be noted as
rendering these notes more complete:--" The Grey-winged Ouzel
breeds throughout the outer ranges of the Himalayas, at any rate
from Darjeeling to Murree, in and about the skirts of forests,
from an elevation of say 4,000 to 7,000 feet. It lays from the end
of April to the early part of August, but the majority lay in May
and June.
The situation of the nest varies: it is sometimes placed on
the ground in some hollow of a massive root, or in a fallen trunk;
sometimes on a ledge of rock, and sometimes in a fork of some
thick tree of moderate size, at no great elevation from the
ground. *
The nests of this species closely resemble those of the
Nilghiri Blackbird. There is the same internal wattle-and-dab
framework, the same massive external coating of moss and
delicate ferns, and the same soft internal lining, in the case of
this species most commonly of fine dry gra c s. The specimens
before me are fully 7J inches in external diameter--beautiful
masses of moss, lichen, and dry feathery fern, standing some-
thing like 5 inches high, with deep egg-cavities, 3^ inches across
by 2 ^ in depth. As far as I can judge M. bo 7 ilboul employs less
mud in the construction of its nest than t the southern allied
species; but their general appearance is very similar, though the
Himalayan nests seem to be generally rather the lightest, although
the largest.
* I11 short it would appear in this respect to follow very closely the habits of our
British favourite.--A. G. B.

Four is the normal number of the eggs, but I have taken
five."
"In their style of colouring the eggs most recall those of
Merida unicolor , and are very different from those of the Nilgliiri
Blackbird. The ground-colour, where visible, is a pale dingy
green, but it is at all times thickly streaked, mottled, and clouded
with dull brownish red, and in some eggs so closely as to entirely
obscure the ground colour. One egg before me is an almost
uniform dull red, here and there mottled slightly paler. In
another egg a good deal of the ground-colour shows through,
except at the large end, where the markings form a confluent
irregular cap. The eggs are slightly glossy and differ little in
size from those of the European and Nilghiri Blackbird, but they
appear to be less commonly pointed and more commonly obtuse
than those of either of these species.
I11 length they vary from i*i to 1*33 inch, and in breadth
from o'83 to 0-92 inch."
I strongly suspect, from what I know of the extraordinary
variability in size, form, and colouring of the European eggs,
that a long series of eggs of M. boidboid would prove to be quite
indistinguishable from those of our species: I have taken the
two types above described and many others equally remarkable,
as may be seen in my "Handbook of British Oology" and
" Birds' Eggs of the British Isles."
I feed my Grey-wing, as I do all Thrushes, upon the same
soft mixture as I give to other Insectivorous birds, with a few
grapes and cockroaches in winter, small English fruits, various
insects or their larvse in summer. He also digs up a good many
worms in moist weather, and I add any which I chance to drop
upon when gardening.

I do not find these birds as delicate as Mr. Fulljames found
them, when he possessed a pair some few years ago. A pair that
I now have are in magnificent plumage and condition; and
readily eat seed of all kinds, as well as lettuce, chickweed,
dandelions, and other green food. I also give them "Marie" or
" Albert" biscuits soaked, and squeezed fairly dry, and this they
are also very fond of.
Mr. Fulljames originally wrote in this Magazine and said
that the male bird only occasionally indulged in unwelcome
" vocal villainies." This is not my experience. My male bird
screams from mere fun and from exhilaration of spirits, and it is
a pity that his voice isn't as lovely as his appearance. I think it
would rival a Nightingale's if it were ! Not seldom it represents
the tune played by a "Punch and Judy" showman; at other
moments, it is not unlike the warbling of a Budgerigar, but of
course louder.
I find that this Parrakeet likes apple very much, and will
probably eat other fruits in season ; so that taking so readily to
such a varied diet, one would think they ought to thrive.
I fear I do not think that the coloured plate in our Maga-
zine (September, 1899, Vol. V., No. 59) does justice at all to this
most beautiful bird. The whole outline is too scraggy, and the
general character is lost, not to mention that the feature of
the male bird, the spatulated wing feather, is conspicuous by
its absence !
They are most gracefully shaped, and their colouring is
indeed beautiful, with the opaline tints of pale blue and pink, and
olive grey-green, and the brilliant grass green shoulders. I
wonder why, just because a bird happens to grow a peculiar
shaped feather in the wing, it should be given a separate generic
name? The Princess of Wales' Parrakeet is very evidently of
the same group as the Barraband (.Polytelis barrabandi ) and the
Rock Pebbler (/*. melanura). Because one brother or cousin in
a family has a snub-nose, and another a Roman nose, it doesn't
make him of a different genus !

on the Princess of Wales&apos; Parrakeet. 249
I11 the Princess of Wales' Parrakeet, the male has the third
feather of the primaries of the wings notched at the end, and
longer than the other feathers; but until two or three more
species have been discovered showing the same peculiarity I
fail to see why this Parrakeet should be separated from the other
members of the Polytelis genus. Why should it not have been
named Polytelis spathopterusf keeping the name of " Princess of
Wales" Parrakeet for its title in English? Truly of making
of names, there is no end! Gould placed it in the genus
Polytelis. Surely one small feather ornamentation of this kind
does not justify a new generic title, or outweigh the otherwise
close resemblance to an already known genus.
It is not absolutely necessary for the English name to
appear in the scientific title; for instance, the Turquoisine
Grass-Parrakeet is always called so by the large majority of
aviculturists, but its Latin title is Neophema pulchella ; and the
Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeet is called Neophema venusta; and
everyone knows that venusta does not signify "blue-winged."
In all other respects, with the exception of one peculiarly
shaped feather in the wings of the male bird only, the Princess
of Wales' Parrakeet closely resembles the Barraband and the
Rock Pebbler. There is the very long tapering tail, the same
style of bill and head, and general form, and ways, and size.
In any case, whatever the names of the birds may be, it is
undoubtedly a most beautiful creature, and a male bird reared by
hand and kept as a cage bird by itself would make a most charm-
ing pet, until he raised his voice, and then one would certainly
say "every rose has its thorn!"
* The present system of nomenclature demands strict adherence to the law of
priority for the specific term ; hence the original name Alexandra cannot be altered.
The peculiar character of the wing in the male (which is illustrated in Parrakeets, p. 126),
was only recently discovered by Mr. North of the Australian Museum, who published the
result of his discovery in the Ibis for 1895. Whether the peculiarity is worthy of generic
distinction is a matter of opinion, but there was no chance of altering the specific term.
The separation of this beautiful species from the genus Polytelis has at any rate served to
call special attention to a feature that is worthy of especial notice.
Would not a better trivial name than that of " Princess of Wales' Parrakeet" be
"Queen Alexandra's Parrakeet," for it was after our present Queen that the species was
named by Gould ?-- Ed.

By Captain Boyd R. Horsbrugh, D.S.C., M.B.O.U.
I will try and send a few notes on birds as observed here
from month to month, and will particularly endeavour to give
some help to brother ornithologists who are keeping S. African
species at home.
The house I am living in at present is on a flat-topped hill
or kopje overlooking the town. The rocky hillsides are scantily
covered with various species of scrubby bushes and low-growing
trees, which manage to exist in spite of a nearly complete
absence of soil, and with very little moisture, save in the swnmer
months of November, December, January, and February, when
the rains occur.
The flat top of the kopje is haunted every morning by
several family parties of the Red Courser ( Cursorms rufiis) and
Rhinoptilus bicinctics, and I have noticed that both species prefer
the open ground and carefully avoid bushes. They both have a
habit of taking short runs and then standing stock still, just as a
Blackbird does on a lawn at home, save that the latter hops.
They are extremely fast on the wing, and the Red Coursers utter
a soft cry of ' gluck,' ' gluck ' when in flight, very like that of the
Namaqua Sand-Grouse ( Pterocles namaqicus).
The Red Coursers ( Cursorms rufzis) are now breeding.
The easiest way to find the eggs is to canter over any rise on the
veldt, and when you arrive on the top, cast a quick glance to
right and left, and if a Courser is sitting it will lift its wings
stiffly over its back to their full length before rising. You can
then ride at once to the spot and find the two lovely eggs lying
on the bare ground, without the smallest vestige of nest. The
eggs very much resemble in colour certain varieties of those of
the Red Grouse.
During the last few days huge flocks, numbering many
thousands, of the S. African Pratincole ( Glareola melanoptera)
have passed swiftly over the house in one direction, and have
returned going to roost in the opposite direction in the evening.
I shot an adult cock and an immature bird the first day,
but have not bothered them since. They are known locally as

the small locust bird, but although there are swarms of locusts
here the Pratincoles seem to feed mainly on winged ants and
small flying beetles.
The locusts nevertheless have one very formidable enemy,
the White Stork ( Ciconia. alba). Two days ago (January 27th)
the locust-swarms were followed by a flock of at least five
hundred of the great birds, and very fine they looked as they
sailed along in wide spirals, in the same line of flight, but high
over the locusts.
The sides of the kopje are inhabited by various busli-
loving species. The Cape Turtle Dove ( Turiur caficolal) and the
Senegal Dove ( T. se?iegale?isis ) are very common and are generally
seen singly, w 7 hile the little Cape Doves ( Gina capensis ) are nearly
always in pairs. I bought six of the latter from a small boy at a
farm for sixpence each, and have put a pair in my newly-built
aviary. I find them very sluggish and lazy and very tame.
They take almost no notice of me when I go into the aviary and
scarcely bother to move out of my way.
The Cape Sparrow ( Passer arcnatus ) is now breeding ; its
habits seem very like those of our home bird, and I noticed
several males having a free fight round a solitary female with the
usual dust and uproar that one sees in any garden at home. I
have also observed them vigorously chasing the Emerald
Cuckoos. The latter bird is parasitic on them and frequently
uses them as foster parents, but is a beautiful flier and easily
evades them in the air.
Two species of Shrike, the Bakbakiri ( La?iius gutturalis )
and the Fiscal Shrike (JL. collaris ) also breed on the slopes. The
former being a green bird and living in a green bush is very
seldom seen ; were it not for its loud and frequent call it would
be thought quite a rare bird. The Fiscal is quite common, and
can be seen any morning sitting on the railings enclosing the
bungalow. One bird visits the aviary every day and creates
great alarm among the inhabitants. I have a trap-cage outside
the aviary, and on several occasions he has only just avoided
capture--but he has grown very wary now.
A small covey of the Red-Winged Francolin lives on the
kopje and haunts the officers' gardens. I am glad to say they

Capt. Boyd R. Horsbrugh,
are more or less protected, and are well-known to the regiment
stationed on Naval Hill. At early dawn this mornng I was
awakened by the clear, ringing ' killy-keelie,' ' killy-keelie ' of
one bird sitting almost on my doorstep, and the loud notes
recalled very vividly the many sunrises I have seen in the
Western Transvaal when on trek.
February 7th. Large flocks of Knots are now here on
their winter migration. I shot some once in the Western
Transvaal during the war and found their crops full of wheat.
The English Swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) and the Spotted
Flycatcher are both common here at present.
A pair of the Familiar Chat ( Saxicola jami liar is) haunt
the bungalow and roost in the interstices beneath the corrugated
iron roofing. This little bird reminds me very much of a young
Redstart in colouring only, it is of a dull brownisli-grey and it
has a reddish tail. It is very tame and friendly and has the
usual Chat-like habit of opening and shutting its wings several
times every few moments as if they didn't fit quite properly.
A few days ago I went to see a man, living in the town of
Bloemfontein, who had some birds in cages, and found he had
among others some Black-fronted Bulbuls ( Pycnonottts nigricans&apos;).
This is a little bird with a note like the Red-vented {P.
hcemorrhous) of India; its colouring is blackish, with yellow
under tail-coverts and a curious fleshy eye-cere of a brilliant red.
Their owner fed them on seed only and seemed quite surprised
that they died so soon ; however, some grapes and an over-ripe
plum showed him very quickly what they really wanted and I
hope they will now do well. He gave me a pair which are doing
well in my aviary. They feed chiefly on grapes and insects
supplied from the garden, such as various beetle-larvae, etc., as
well as the house-flies they catch for themselves ; and excellent
flycatchers they are, too.
The owner of the aviary also had several examples of the
Red-lieaded Finch ( Amadina erythrocephala). This is a common
bird here ; several small parties of them visit their brethren in my
aviary frequently, and I trapped a fine pair in an ordinary trap
cage a little time ago. I11 its habits, song, and general

behaviour it is exactly like the familiar Cut-throat (A. fasciaia),
so well-known in every bird dealer's shop at home.
In the same aviary there were also Alario Finches, Cape
Canaries ( Serinus canicollis ), Sulphury Seed-eater (A. sulphuratus,
S. icterus, the Giant Wbydah ( Cher a progne), and a single
specimen of the Cape Bunting ( Fringillaria capensis&apos;).
There are plenty of these little Buntings on Naval Hill
and several of them haunt my aviary. I have caught five or six
with an ordinary sieve and a stick supporting it with a fine piece
of string attached to the stick. They seem stupid little things; I
missed catching one and he didn't seem to mind it at all, but
merely went and sat on a stone about six yards off while I set
the trap again, and then went under and was caught. One cock
bird I put in the aviary was very vicious to his own species,
completely scalping a hen bird and beating her brains out; but
with other species they are quite peaceable. They like to sit
quite flat on a rock in the sun and look just like tiny Ouail.
The cock has a pleasant little song of four notes.
Last week I paid a visit to the Zoo in Pretoria and saw
several fine Giant Whydalis. Dr. Gunning, the Curator, has
some very nice birds in these gardens, and amongst the lovely
trees and flowers and in the warm air, all the S. Africau species
thrive wonderfully.
I saw the Curl-crested Guinea-fowl ( Guttera edouardi ), the
Cape Pochard ( Nyroca capensis&apos;) and Gallirex porphyriocephala,
I have never seen this handsome Plantain-eater in captivity
before. It is in a huge aviary about the size of the one in
Loudon in which the Ibis and Flamingoes are kept, and I was
much struck with its peculiar soft, gliding flight. It was quite
tame and came down close to the bars to take a bit of apple
from a child's hand.
Before leaving Pretoria for Bloemfontein I went to see an
aviary in the town, and in it I noticed the following interesting
species : the Bar-breasted Weaver-finch ( Ortygospiza polyzona),
a queer little bird with a metallic chirp like that of a Zebra-
finch. It seems to spend all its time on the ground, and why it
is called a " Weaver-Finch " I cannot quite imagine. The owner
of the aviary gave me three specimens of the Blue-breasted

Waxbill (Estrilda angolensis&apos;). This species is very common
near Pretoria this year. I turned them into my aviary, but
two unfortunately died ; the other has stood some cold nights
very well and looks very cheerful.
This species has already been described in a previous
volume of the Magazine by the able pen of Mr. R. Phillipps, and
I have as yet no new notes to add to his description. I quite
agree with him that the song of the cock is sweeter and more
sustained than that of the Cordon Bleu, its very near relative.
I was also given the only specimen in the aviary of the
Black-faced Waxbill ( E. erythronota ) a little bird that I believe
has not yet been imported into England. This specimen did
well in my aviary but would never roost under cover; the
consequence was that a heavy hail and thunderstorm came on
one night and he was killed. I have had a somewhat indifferent
skin made from him and have sent him to our Editor for a
description. The bird's song is quite sweet and it is a most
attractive species. My bird would come down close to our faces
when we visited the aviary and was exceedingly active and
sprightly.
[We have never heard of Estrilda erythronota being brought alive to
this country. Its distribution is given by the late Dr. Stark as "South
Africa to the north of the Orange and Vaal Rivers, ranging northward
through Namaqua and Damara Land to Lake Ngami; very generally dis-
tributed in the Transvaal, Bechuanaland, and Rhodesia, extending as far
north as Masai Land and Central Africa."
The same author describes its habits as " very like those of the com-
mon E. astrilda. In the Transvaal during winter these pretty litttle birds
feed on the ground in small flocks, generally near bushes, to which they fly
if disturbed. Their food consists almost entirely of grass seeds. They
have a low, gentle, twittering note, frequently repeated when they are
searching for food and also as they take flight. Towards spring the
flocks break up and they remain in pairs until the following autumn."
The following is a description of this species in which the sexes are
alike save that the female is slightly duller than the male: General colour
grey, tinged with red and delicately pencilled with fine blackish lines,
which become broader and much more conspicuous on the wing-coverts ;
lower back, rump and upper tail-coverts crimson, faintly barred with a
darker colour; abdomen crimson; vent and under tail-coverts and tail
black; lores, ear-coverts and chin black; bill dark lead-colour, becoming
black at the tip ; feet black. Total length about 4 J inches. --Kd.].

Although there is nothing very special to report this
mouth, numbers of the birds are nesting, and there is every
prospect of the present season being a very good one as regards
the number of young birds reared.
The female Darwin's Rhea, which was the mother of two
hybrid Rheas which were hatched but not reared last year, has
laid several eggs, her mate this year being a fine male of her own
species belonging to the President of the Society. These eggs
are in an incubator, and it is to be hoped that, in the event of
their hatching, those in charge will be more successful in rear-
ing the chicks than was the case last year.
In the Eastern Pheasantry a pair of Wonga-wonga Pigeons
have hatched two young ones which are doing well, and another
pair of squabs have been bred from a male Turtur tranquebarica
and female hybrid T. tranquebarica x T. risoria. The Black
Vultures, in the old Argus Pheasantry, have one egg on the
ground upon which, on our last visit, the female was sitting.
The Crested Screamers, which bred last year for the first
time in Europe, nested early this year, two eggs being laid and
one chick hatched, which unfortunately only survived one day.
They are now nesting again, and with warmer weather there
should be a good prospect of success with the second clutch.
The New Garden Guide % has now been issued, and should
be obtained by all who take an interest in this fascinating
corner of Regent's Park. It is a most instructive little book,
and by a careful perusal of its pages one may obtain a very fair
general knowledge of the various groups, families etc. of the
animal kingdom. The illustrations, which are liberally dis-
tributed through its pages, and one of which we reproduce here,
are all from photographs, and are excellent.

information likely to be of use to those who intend to participate, has now
been issued and forwarded to all who have already signified their intention
of being present. Copies may be obtained on application to Mr. Bonhotk,
Fen Ditton Hall, Cambridge. It is intended, if possible, to arrange for a

THE MUSKY LORIKEET ; AUSTRALIAN FINCHES.
Sir, --I am writing to ask if you can kindly identify a Parrakeet for
me, it may be a common one but I have never seen it before, nor can I find
it in the Avicultural Magazine, of which I have all the back numbers not
out of print. I have written for Mr. Seth-Smith's book and shall doubtless
find it there, but am writing on the chance of its not being there. The
man I got them from said they came from Australia and called them
Keith's Parrakeets, a name I have never heard, and which probably is only
used in Australia. I got some Star and Blood Finches and had some
difficulty in finding out their English names. Long-tailed and true Masked
Finches were also received under the one name of Masked Finch. I must
say that Star is a better name than Rufous-tail ; rufous is vague and to
my mind covers too much ground in the colour line, besides, the little
silvery spots are very star-like. Blood has an ugly sound but it does hit off
the colour exactly, and from most accounts seems to fit in with the bird's
morals.
However, to get back to the Keith's. General colour grass green,
band on forehead passing through the eyes to and on the ear coverts--
bright red, on top of head between the red-light blue, 011 back of neck
extending to inter-scapular region--glossy chestnut brown, a small stripe
down from the shoulder on sides of breast bright yellow. Size, a bit smaller
than a Cockatiel, but more the shape of a Blossom-liead, except as to tail,
which is wedge-shaped at present in all my four birds and does not look
like changing. Tail, green feathers black shafted with black tips. When
the tail is spread out in anger, as it often is, there appear to be some red
feathers near the base showing through when looked at from above, but
there is no red to be seen underneath. The breast is the same grass green
but looks as if the feathers might be yellow, tipped with green. Bill
reddish black with red tip. I can send fuller details if required.
At present they are in the same aviary cage (14ft. by 3ft. by 5ft. high),
with Rosellas, Many-colours, Javas, Pekin Robins, &amp;c., till the aviary is
ready for them, getting the same food. It was very cold when they arrived
up here and they felt it a bit, but are quite fit now. At first they fought a
good bit amongst themselves, much noise and no damage, but they were

then in much smaller quarters with much the same birds, which they left
alone. They are now divided off into twos and are at peace. I have hopes
that they are two pairs, as one of each two is a good deal smaller than
the other, there may be other differences but I have had little time to spare
lately with lots of work--work, most of the spare time from that being
taken up with play-work getting the aviaries ready.
Can these birds be Conures ? about which I know absolutely
nothing, nor do I know much about Parrakeets except the commoner
kinds, not having kept them and being without good books.

[Your description corresponds to the Musky Lorikeet (Gtossopsittacus
concinnus). These birds are often brought over on a diet of seed alone, and
bird-dealers generally recommend this as the most suitable food for them.
If long-continued, however, it generally results in death by fits, though we
have known of cases where these birds, kept in very large outdoor
aviaries, have lived for quite a long time on seed and green food alone.
The most suitable diet, however, is milk sop, made with boiling milk
poured over crumb of bread or powdered plain biscuit and sweetened with
sugar. Plenty of ripe fruit should be given, and canary seed. A coloured
figure of this species is given in "Parrakeets." We have never before heard
it called "Keith's Parrakeet."--E d.].
AUSTRALIAN BIRDS.
Sir,--I was very interested in Mr. Astley's account of his Australian
birds, as I was expecting that there would shortly be importations of rare
birds from Australia. Worse luck, we in India only got the fringe of the
exportation so to speak. However it is so hard to get any birds one wants
here (my special hobby being Grassfiuches, Waxbills, &amp;c., and in a lesser
degree small Parrakeets) that I fancy I was just as delighted with my lot as
Mr. Astley was with his, though I do covet his Bourke's and Painted
Finches, and almost more than all his hen Crimson Finches (called
Blood Finches in Australia), the latter because I do hate having odd sexes
about, my solitary hen died shortly after arrival, though the two cocks
look very fit and at present are peaceable.
My lot included "Keith's" Parrakeets, Main'-coloured Parrakeets,
Star (Rufous-tailed), Blood, Diamond, Gouldiau, Masked, Long-tailed Grass-
finches. At the same time were received through the kindness of Mr. D.
Ezra (but for whom indeed my aviaries would be very empty) some lovely
Mealy Rosellas, some Yellow Budgerigars, and some other small birds.
You can imagine my delight in getting all these birds, when I mention that
in December last my highest hopes went little further than Zebras and
Bengalese: but then the aviculturist is never quite unsatisfied. My

immediate chief wants are hens of Cutthroats (don't smile, I have had two
cocks 2J years), and Blood Finches. My wants in the near future will take
up too much room, and many of them will I fear be beyond my pocket,
even if they should be procurable, though I might mention that I fell in
love with Bonrkes when I first read their description many years ago; I am
almost afraid to see one in the flesh for fear of losing an illusion.
I am glad to see that onr Editor suggests the use of the name of
Star-finch. My other letter, by the way, was written before receipt of the
Magazine.

THE AGES TO WHICH BIRDS DIVE.
Sir, --My little Reddish Finch committed suicide in the water-pan
this morning, May 15th. I have no exact record of the purchase of this
specimen, but I referred to it as in my possession in 1S97 which will give it
at least eight years in captivity. This is a greater age than any of my other
Spermophilcz have attained to, with the exception perhaps of the White-
throated Finch, and is a very fair record for so tiny a bird.

Sir, --I should be glad to hear through these columns of any of our
members who may have purchased a pair of the few young Blue Bonnets, im-
ported in March last, and have managed to keep them alive. During my five
and twenty years of aviculture I have hankered after a pair of Blue Bonnets,
and had at last, as I imagined, attained my ambition, when what was my
disappointment to find on arrival two poor little babies in nest feathers,
with the blue only just appearing on their faces. It was not that I minded
their sombre hues, but I foresaw the difficult}&apos; there would be in keeping
them alive. They seemed, however, fairly healthy (but their pretty, jaunty,
little ways did something to deceive one as to their real condition), and for
theffirst two days we got on pretty well, but at the end of about ten they
were both dead. I was told to feed them on oats and canary, but especially
the former; after a few days they left off touching the oats, and I soon saw
they were only " cliibbling " up the canary seed, and not really eating it.
From the first I provided them with fruit, which was soon supplemented with
other things, until by degrees I got a menu of eleven dishes to try to tempt
them if not with one thing then with another, but all to no purpose. When
they would no longer even pretend to eat I recognised they were past hope,
so resorted to cramming as a dernier ressort. Being such babies I thought
artificial feeding was admissible. I made a fine paste of crushed biscuit,
milk, and yolk of egg, and after a little time they did not object to the

process, and even tried to lick it off the end of the quill. But, as I have
said before, it was of no use, and they wasted to mere skin and bone
before they finally succumbed. I am half afraid not one of those few and
expensive specimens of this rare and beautiful Parrakeet is by this time
alive, but should be pleased to learn that other members had met with
better success. E. A. H. HARTLEY.

Sir, --Mr. Astley, at page 236, has somewhat misrepresented what I
said. Possibly my letter may have been carelessly framed, for he has
confused two different lines of thought which were present in my mind
when I replied to his communication respecting various birds.
Concerning the Yellow-headed Gouldian Finch, I intended to say,
and am reasonably satisfied I did say, that it is found in the rvild state, and
that it is regarded as the yellow phase of the Red-headed Gouldian Finch.
Then I went on to refer to another matter, to abnormally coloured
Gouldian Finches in general, which are usually the impure and debilitated
descendants of captive Red- and Black-lieaded Gouldian Finches that have
been crossed and interbred and generally mixed up together. These, by
the way, usually have whitish heads and under parts, some being entirely
of an impure white, others partially so, the green alone of the entire
plumage maintaining its colour unaffected. Clearly these have degenerated
several stages below the yellow phase.
And I mentioned how that in past years I had purchased some of
these queer coloured Gouldians, and how that, after they had been
properly tended in 1113&apos; aviar}&apos;, they had moulted into ordinary full coloured
Red- or Black-headed Gouldian Finches.
I should add that I do not refer to melauistic examples, which
mostly fall into a third category, for there may be and often are good wild-
caught birds that have been spoilt by improper treatment in captivit}\

book again, might have suggested a few alterations, and have found some-
thing to say about that great favourite " the Gouldian Finch," which bird
was not known when the book was written, and is therefore not
mentioned, beyond a brief reference to the desirability of seeing arrivals of

not yet seen alive in Europe.
As I wrote my treatise on Foreign Cage Birds by request, and under
peculiar circumstances, and ceded my interest in the first and subsequent

ago has still some interest for those who care for or keep foreign cage
birds, I may be permitted to say that I thought my treatise had been
superseded by more recent works on the subject, notably by Dr. A. G.
Butler's fine work and by Mr. Setli-Smith's book on Parrots, for it should
be understood that what I wrote was penned fully 25 years ago.
It is very curious, however, that since that rather remote period only
two species of Finches have come on the bird-market which were not
known then, viz., the Long-tailed Grassfincli and the Gouldian Finch.
On the other hand, many kinds which were to be seen fairly often 30
years ago, have become extremely rare now. I described many birds from live
specimens then in my collection, which cannot be obtained now at any
price, whilst when I was a buyer of rare foreign birds, I could find them
occasionally without paying extravagant sums for them.
But it is fair to add that for the first pair of Liothrix which came
into my hands some 30 years ago, I had to pay ^10, whilst now any number
can be bought from 5s. to 10s. per pair.
Some of the Waxbills have become so cheap that I fear it i cheaper
for those charged with their transport to face a large percentage of loss
during the voyage and whilst on sale, than to take much care of the well-
being of the poor little birds.
If the cheaper edition of my old treatise puts the book within reach
of dealers and bird catchers in the Colonies and induces them to bring over
varieties which have become rare in the market and would fetch a
remunerative price, instead of sending thousands of common small
Waxbills, where hundreds would satisfy the demand, I should be very
pleased.
Those who have seen my book will have noticed that the plates are
rather unequal, though drawn by the same artist. The cause of this may
now be stated. Some of the plates had been designed and were actually in
the press before I had any idea of writing the book. These were drawn
from stuffed specimens. Subsequently the artist drew the birds from live
specimens in my collection, or which I procured on loan for the purpose.
I leave it to those who are interested in bird portraits to find out which
plates were drawn from living and which from stuffed birds.

Sir,--I n my letter, asking how to treat Rain Quails during Winter,
line 14, page 234, should read " preventing her feeding" not breeding. The
fault may be mine.
The chief point which my letter was meant to convey was, if the
cock prevented the hen from feeding, and pecked at her spitefully, why
did she mope away and die when taken away from the bully ?
The Chinese Painted Quails are easy enough to keep all the year
round. The others do not die from fright or make a fuss when I go to
feed them or clean out the cage.
I bought the first pair of Rain Quails about September 15th, 1902. I
had seen them in a shop for quite a fortnight before, with their heads all
knocked about. .Seeing that they seemed otherwise healthy, I bought
them. The cock I have still, but the hens have died as above. They were
tame enough to take mealworms from my fingers through the wires of the
cage. H. L. SlCH.

<bodyText confidence="0.936764333333333" page_id="32656793"  page_num="261" year="" vol="">
Sir,--M ight I draw your attention to two printer's errors in the
article you were good enough to publish in the last number of the
Avicnltural Magazine on " The Aviary and its Management."
(1) On page 226, third paragraph, 9th and iotli lines, instead of "sea
and," it should read "sea-sand." (2) On page 228, last sentence of the
article, instead of Allen and Hanbury's " Hyno-pliosphates," it should read
" Byno-Phospliates."
I trust that the article has proved interesting to most of the younger
members of the .Society. Jas. Geo. Myran.
Sir, --Dr. J. G. Mvlan in his paper on "The Aviary and its Manage-
ment " published in your May issue remarks that birds " could easily
contract such diseases as typhoid, consumption, and diphtheria." Other
medical men who have made a special study of bird diseases tell us that
they have never come across a case of typhoid or consumption in a bird.
As a scientific man, it is to be presumed that Dr. Mylan would not have
made the above-quoted remark unless his experience had been different
from theirs, and I therefore venture to ask him, in the interests of the
fascinating science of bird diseases, to give us particulars of the cases in
which he has diagnosed these diseases in birds, and the grounds for his
diagnosis.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Diamond Sparrow (Mr. A. Cummings). [Your bird was much emaciated, and died of
syncope. The wing was considerably out of gear, inasmuch as the clavicle had been
fractured and never united again].
Waxwing (Mr. W. H. St. Quinlin). In owner's possession over three years, was in per-
fect health and was paired, constantly showing off to and feeding its mate. For two
days was dull and mopey, gradually got worse, and died. It had no symptoms of fits.
[Your bird died of acute inflammation of the bowels. No doubt your feeding is cor-
rect as it has agreed with your bird for so long - . There was no food to be found when
examined post mortem. I should say probably a chill may have caused it. It was a
male].
Californian Quail, hen (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). Has been in an aviary with a cock and
another hen and two Parrakeets. There have been a good many eggs for a month
or more, but no nest has ever been made by either hen. P&apos;or a few days she was ailing
and gradually grew worse until she died. [Your bird died of inflammation of the
oviduct owing to the retention of a broken egg. I frequently found the hen Quails
lay their eggs about, but as soon as I found one egg I made a nice bit of cover with
bushes, or sometimes by leaning a piece of wood against the wall in the aviary, under
which I would scoop out a hole, say 8 inches deep, in the damp soil, and line it with
hay, and as the eggs were laid so they were put into the nest, and, invariably, by the
time the third egg was laid the bird would have taken to the nest. But I never kept
more than one hen with one cock, and I must say that I have successfully reared
scores of young birds],
Gouldian, hen (Mrs. Goiter). Died quite suddenly in the night; it did not seem to see
very well. [Your bird died of cerebral meningitis caused by an injury].
Yellow Budgerigar (Mr. W. Williams). Found dead; no sign, as far as we could tell, of
illness. [Your bird died of an apoplectic fit. It is difficult to say why these birds,
especially during the breeding season, are so subject to apoplexy. When I was
breeding these birds, I would frequently remove the seed boxes for a day or two, and
scatter the seed about the aviary floor, so that they had to work for their living.
They do themselves very well, and, unless in large aviaries, cannot get the necessary
exercise. I sold a large flock of these birds to a lady member of our Society, and I
have lately heard that they are breeding freely].
Australian Green-winged Dove (Mr. W. J. Lewis). Died this morning; two days ago
was found on the ground unable to walk or fly, with apparently no power to swallow.
[Concussion of the brain from injury, the skull being dented in, which caused
pressure on the brain],
Whvdah (Mr Chas. L. Rothera). In outdoor aviary; a few days ago it became Iump5 r ,
sat on the ground with its head under its wing. [Pneumonia was the cause of death].
Budgerigar (Mr. B. Mason). In cold room all the winter. [Acute pneumonia was the
cause of death].
Grey Parrot (Mrs. Barber). In owner's possession about three weeks ; at first it was fed
on soaked maize, as dealer advised, but afterwards on hemp, canary, wheat, and dari.
It had diarrhoea and seemed to lose its appetite; was kej . warm, and given a few
drops of brandy and chalk. [Your bird died of enteritis. I find newly imported
birds do best on boiled flat maize, prepared fresh every day, as a staple food, and
gradually, in the course of a few weeks, get them on to 1 mixture of canary, millet,
oats, wheat, and dari. I do not give much, if any, hemp, unless I find a bird going
thin, in which case you will find hemp very useful, but if given in quantity it is liable
to darken the beautiful delicate grey color of the healthy bird. For diarrhoea, I find
clilorodyne and chalk in the drinking water, or tamalbin in pill form, the best
remedies. I have reared, or rather acclimatized, 27 out of 28 in one season, but I, of
course, bought thoroughly healthy birds to commence with].

BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October jotA, iqoi.
" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot
Parrots which I have reared were brought up on your ^Esthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE " of Dec. 4th

Parrot-rearing:, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

Avivioperdix heyi.
By A. Trevor-Battye, M.A., F.T.S., F.Z.S.
When I was in the Cairo Zoological Gardens, in the spring
of last year, 1904,1 was much struck by the elegance of these little
partridges, and through the kindness of Captain S. S. Flower,
the Director, was able to bring home a pair. I have not heard
of any in private hands in this country, and perhaps our Zoo-
logical Society's list, which shows there were some in the
Gardens in 1879, forms the last aviary record we have of them.
A few words of preface will therefore not be out of place.
Temminck b) tells us that he received a male and female of
" this new species " from M. Cretschmaer, Director of the Natural
History Museum of Frankfort, which had been forwarded by M.
Riippel to his native town. Cretschmaer had named it "after M.
Hey, Ruppel's companion in the deserts of Acaba [Alcabah] in
Arabia." The birds, drawn in the Natural History Museum in
Paris, are figured in Temminck's work, and are recognisable.
Riippel in his work &lt; 2 ) remarks that " its name in the
Hedjas Province is Hadjel."
Gould figures a pair of these birds b) from specimens
" brought from Arabia by Tord Robert Clinton." Considering
that these drawings were from dead specimens they are very
good.

Mr. A. Trevor-Battye,
Temminck placed this bird under the genus Perdix,
Tristram at first under Caccabis, justly remarking b) "The whole
plumage, with the orange bill and lemon coloured tarsi, is a
singular blending of the characteristics of the types of Caccabis
and PerdixP But the bird entirely wants the spurs of the Red-
leg, and finally gained the generic name of Ammoperdix , which
seems to have been conferred on it by Gould--or I have not
been able to find it so given in any work earlier than his.
I have somewhere seen this bird written of as the Sand-
partridge, and Mr. Ogilvie-Grant speaks of it (5) and its ally
Bonham's Partridge (A. bonhami) [the only other member of the
genus] under their popular name of "See-see" Partridges.
This name, said to express the call of Bonham's, conveys no
idea whatever of that of Hey's Partridge. So I have here called
them " Rock-Partridges," for that fitly expresses their habits.
Of Bonham's Partridge Mr. Ogilvie - Grant writes ( 4 5 6 7 ) " This
handsome little Partridge is met with at elevations ranging
from sea-level to 6,000 or 7,000 feet " ; and he quotes Mr.
Hume, who says ( 6a ) " the barer and more desolate the ravines
and gorges, the more thoroughly do they seem at home." This
is true also of Hey's Rock-Partridge, as we shall presently see.
By far the best account from first-hand observation which
I have seen is this by Canon Tristram. He writes: b)

" This lovely little bird, smaller than the Grey Partridge,
abounds in the rocks near the Dead Sea, but is never found
more than a few miles from that lake, though common in Arabia
Petrcea. It runs in large coveys, and is flushed with difficulty,
as the birds have a habit of separating and concealing them-
selves behind stones without rising ; but once startled it has a
vigorous flight. It has a habit, singular for a Partridge, of
laying its eggs in holes and fissures of the rocks. ... I once
found a nest in a deep hole in the side of the cliff, containing
twenty-seven eggs, sixteen of which were of the preceding
year and addled, the others being quite fresh."
The two members of the genus Ammoperdix, have the
following very distinct distribution. &lt; 8 )
A. bonhami. Bonham's Rock-Partridge; "South-Western
Asia, extending westwards to the Euphrates Valley, eastwards to
North-West India, in the north to Transcaspia, and south to
Aden."
A.heyi. Hey's Rock-Partridge ; "Both sides of the Red
Sea, extending north to the Dead Sea, westwards to Egypt and
Nubia, about as far south as 20* N. latitude, and eastwards to
Muscat, Persian Gulf."
When one looks through the skins of Hey's Partridge in
the British (Nat. Hist.) Museum one finds that they fall into two
very well-marked divisions. The Palestine and Egyptian form
is as I have described below, but birds from the Persian Gulf are
slightly smaller and more vinaceous in general colouring. This
variety Mr. Ogilvie-Grant has named A. chomleyi. ( 8a )-
The colouring of my birds is as follows. Adult male:
Bill orange ; legs dull yellow ; head, neck and throat plum grey;
ear-coverts white; scapulars and wing-coverts reddish fawn with
no markings ; flight-feathers olivaceous, the outer web barred with
reddish fawn and dark grey ; croup and rump sandy yellow closely
beset with dark grey bars ; tail of twelve feathers, the two central

same as rump, the remainder dark chestnut, slightly spotted on
the inner web : upper breast vinaceous fawn ; lower breast
formed of longitudinal curved stripes. The feathers composing
these stripes are thus coloured, from below, upwards: edge very
dark vaudyke brown (almost black); a line of chestnut; a line
of greyish white ; a. thin edge of brown. Towards the flanks the
stripe is broken, and thence curves outwards and downwards.
Female : Bill yellowish horn ; legs dull yellow ; head and
neck ochreous, with wavy bands of dark brownish grey ; throat
buffish white; breast light buff, with wavy bars of brownish
grey ; back reddish fawn, with fainter bars of a darker colour.
The birds arrived in England on the 8th of April. On
board ship they became quite tame, taking food from my fingers.
They were fond of apples, oranges, bananas, and any kind of
fruit.
At first they shared a compartment of their aviary with a
pair of Spotted Sandgrouse (. Pterocles senegallus), a pair of Palm
Doves (Turtur senegalensis), and a pair of Californian Quails
(Lophortyx calif ornicus J, but after a day or two I removed these
other birds. I did my best to give them appropriate surround-
ings, making clefts and crevices of stone for them to nest in.
They were also given a little tunnel to run through, which
pleased them very much. They constantly inspected these
holes, but never took to any as a nesting-place. At the end
of April they paired.
The male, during the nesting season, shews himself off
to the very best advantage. Raising himself to his fullest
height and ruffling out all his feathers, he stands thus on the
highest stone he can find, crowing repeatedly, or runs about
in this Penguin-like attitude, only the tips of his toes show-
ing below his ruffled feathers. This display I have tried to
reproduce in the illustration. The call consists of a double note
repeatedly uttered.
On May 15th I picked up a broken egg of the same shape
as that of the Grey Partridge, but slightly smaller and of a
uniform fawn colour. I had placed some boughs of common
furze in the corners and round a pole in the middle, and on this
they were fond of perching. Later on I removed it, as I

fancied the little broken-off pieces pricked the hen's breast
and prevented her from sitting. I put in its place large
tussocks of coarse wood-grass.
O11 May 20th another egg was dropped in the outer aviary.
Meantime the birds had made a little shallow scratching near
one of the inner corners; in this I placed the egg and here the
hen continued to lay. By June 3rd she had laid ten eggs.
Whether she would ever sit seemed very doubtful; I therefore
decided to try these eggs under a hen. Unfortunately I had then
no bantams, and though I scoured the villages round I could not
find a broody bantam of any sort. However, I made the
best imitation I could of a common partridge's nest in a bank
among some grasses, and there I put the ten eggs in the keep-
ing of a smallish barred mongrel hen. She sat extremely well,
and on July 4th one egg was chipped. But twenty-four hours
later, as the chipping had gone no farther and the other eggs
showed no signs, I helped out the chipper and found a big dead
embryo in every other egg. This little chick throve well until
July 17th. At 11.30 of that sunny morning the chick was all
right: a few minutes later the barred hen stood listening to the
call of a distant game-cock, her foot on the crushed and lifeless
body of my first young Hey's Partridge.
On the 10th of this month I had lost the hen partridge.
She died after having laid her thirty-sixth egg.
The story of my second venture goes rather better. On
June 21st I had set a black bantam 011 twelve more eggs, and
she had settled down well. These eggs began to be chipped on
July 14th. The chicks had just the same trouble in finding
their way out, and some died in the shell. Five were released
by my fingers and soon grew strong.
By July 8th another batch of twelve eggs had collected,
but still the partridge showed no signs of settling down to sit.
So on that day I placed the twelve under a game bantam pro-
cured from a neighbour with the assurance that she had only
just begun to sit. She took kindly to her new eggs and sat
steadily until the last day of the month, when she suddenly
threw up sitting and all those eggs were spoiled.

Mr. A. Trevor-Battye,
So after all I had only five Hey's Partridge chicken, but
they throve well in a large wired-in run on the lawn.
They were wonderful runners and very quick-sighted.
The smallest insect on the wing led to a rapid race across the
grass of their enclosure. Sometimes they would all squat
suddenly on the ground with their heads stretched out, and then
looking up I could see a hawk passing high over head. From
the very first they were adepts at hiding: when only just dry
from the shell, on the hen being raised so that I could move
them, they had scattered in every direction, darting in under
roots and grasses and flattening themselves down in the most
remarkable way. Their colour, a uniform pearl drab, made
them practically invisible. As nestlings they had absolutely no
markings, entirely wanting the dark back stripes characteristic
of most game birds, te)-
They were raised entirely on ants' "eggs."
We nearly had a tragedy one day. As we were rather short
of wire netting I had only fixed up three sides of a square, the
fourth being formed by the outside of an aviary compartment in
which some Burrowing Owls had their young ones--an arrange-
ment which had the disadvantage that in order to reach the
partridges one had to pass through the owls' house. Boarding
18 inches high runs all round the bottom of the wiring as
a screen against dogs or other alarms. The little par-
tridges took to running along the top of this and putting
their heads through. Once I found one hanging there,
caught by the head. The Burrowing Owls seemed to take too
much interest in the incident, so I rigged up a screen of matting
to keep things safe. But on the day in question the door
insecurely fastened had swung open while my back was
turned, and instantly all five small partridges were in the enemy's
quarters. The owls got very excited, and it was only by keeping
them oft with my handkerchief that I managed to catch up one
youngster after the other and pass them to the outside.
It was not long before they were strong fliers, and on the
(9) Ihose who have read Mr. Pycraft's interesting articles in
Knowledge, will appreciate the significance of this fact.

fourteenth day I found the black bantam and her family walking
gaily along the high thatched ridge of the aviary roof. So I cut
her wing.
After a while the young birds were trained off on to seeds ;
they liked spray millet better than any other kind. It turned out
that they were three cocks and one hen. All grew up until you
could scarcely tell them from the old ones. Unfortunately the
little hen died ; I do not know why. The three young cocks are
now (June 18, 1905) flourishing, and quite indistinguishable from
the old cock. I am very sorry that I have no hen alive; but all
Captain Flower's kind efforts to get me some more have been
unsuccessful. I had hoped that this summer they would have
reared their own young in the garden, in a sunny enclosure
with dry banks, a pool, apple trees, flowering shrubs, coarse
grasses and water plants, where last year the Californian Quails
hatched their young.
These partridges have a very daintily pretty way of walk-
ing. They are also extremely light fliers, going straight up every
evening to roost on a beam immediately above their heads in the
aviary roof. They also perch a good deal in the branches of a
dead Austrian pine.
They are great grass eaters, picking out the heart of the
grass most persistently. Their plot, re-turfed in the autumn with
fine new turf from the down, soon became brown and dead, while
that of the Spotted Sandgrouse next door has remained green
and flourishing. They are also fond of chickweed, dandelion,
lettuce and fruit.
These birds, coming from a sunlit country, welcome every
ray of sunshine. They get the first sun at dawn, and it is full on
the aviary until 12 o'clock. Then as it moves behind the elm
trees the partridges follow each little checkered patch that finds
its way through the branches, squatting in each in turn.
When startled they raise their crests. They are also able
to move independently the white ear coverts.
They are cautious and inquisitive. Any new object placed
in their aviary--a stone, a brick, or even their green food if put
in an unaccustomed place, is carefully scrutinized. It is pretty
to see them then, creeping cautious!}&apos; nearer and nearer, walking

on tip-toe, so to say, with heads low and necks stretched out
to their fullest extent.
Hey's Rock-Partridge has two kinds of note. First, a
quietly and often uttered conversational note, something like that
of the Chukot but more musical. They talk constantly in this way
together, and then the note has a confidential twittering sound;
again, if disturbed, they make use of the same note, but then it is
louder and protesting. The birds of both sexes use this talking
note. Their other note is the call or " crow " of the male bird,
a double call-note clear and ringing, but quite unreproducible in
syllables.
A&apos; # *X- O-
Since the above was written the birds have been liberated
in the garden enclosure. There are some Scaly-breasted Quails,
Chukors and Grey Francolins in the same enclosure, and it is
interesting to observe the great differences in the habits of these
allied birds, under comparatively natural conditions. The
Chukors when they wish to hide crouch by a tuft of herbage ;
the Hey's Partridges on the other hand choose the barest part of
a dry bank which just matches them in colour, or else squat
flat in one of their dusting holes into which they exactly fit,
their backs level with the surrounding ground. I have then
often known a visitor, though standing almost over them, quite
unable to see them with an unaccustomed eye. The Francolins
I have only seen once in the last three weeks: you could not
find them without a spaniel.
On the night of the furious gale of February 28, the wind
burst open the owls' partition door. In the morning one part-
ridge was missing, and the rest were much ruffled. They must
have gone through a bad time that night, for though morning saw
the owls back in their own compartment, looking preteruaturally
innocent, the missing partridge was presently found half eaten
in the entrance to a burrow.
I have now given one of the young birds to the Zoo-
logical Gardens. Itis in the Western Aviary, and seems to have
paired with a Californian Quail.

By Arthur G. Butuer, Ph.D., F.L.S., etc.
Of all the British Insectivorous birds suitable for avicul-
ture, none are more satisfactory in almost every respect than the
Wagtails. Graceful, lively, easily tamed, and by no means
difficult to feed, they only have three faults: they are inclined to
be pugnacious if two cocks are kept together; they are some-
times spiteful to weaker associates; and their song, which is
sweet and pleasing, is not frequently heard.
As regards their food, one must give them that which
experience proves to be suitable, without regard to the criticisms
of prophets of evil. Some years ago, when dried flies began to
be generally recognized as an excellent food for insectivorous
birds, the late Dr. Bradburn violently opposed the use of them,
under the impression that these insects were a species of blow-
fly bred from putrid fish ; and, although I assured him that they
were Hemipterous insects closely related to the water-boatmen
of our ponds, he w r ould not be convinced, but declared emphati-
cally that he knew they were actual flies because he had seen
their wings (I suppose he imagined that water bugs were destitute
of these organs).
Somewhat later a writer in the "Feathered World" insisted
upon the absolute uselessness of dried ants' cocoons as a food for
birds : living ants' cocoons he thought might be of some value ;
but when dead he considered them w&apos;orse than useless : I imagine
that he looked upon them as the decayed corpses of insects
which had died a natural death.
Subsequently there was a great stir made respecting the
dangerous character of bread-crumbs as a food for insectivorous
birds ; one of our members considering it most deadly to all the
more delicate Warblers (meaning such birds as warbled) : a long
discussion ensued which convinced nobody.
Yet more recently, and for the second time, egg in all its
forms has been condemned as a most dangerous food, on the
ground that it is a favourite food of the bacillus of enteritis ; and,
provided that a bird nourished upon this food be in a sickly
condition, it renders him much more likely to be attacked by

272 Dr. A. G. Butler,
that disease than if this article of diet were omitted from his
food.
In the discussion respecting the use of bread-crumbs,
biscuit was regarded as only one degree less dangerous ; so that
nearly all the foods which were considered most suitable by the
Russ school of aviculturists, and by the use of which they kept
insectivorous birds in perfect health and condition for many
years, have been condemned as dangerous: but, when one is
aware that the condemnation of many articles of human con-
sumption has led to the production of a sect of pasty-faced, frog-
handed beings, who subsist upon plasmon and ground nuts, one
must needs hesitate to accept their dicta as convincing, or even
take them seriously.
Wagtails in captivity, like other insectivorous birds, live in
perfect health for years upon a combination of all the afore-
mentioned ' dangerous ' foods, with the addition of living insects,
their larvae and pupae, spiders, and centipedes.
Having due regard to their associates, there can be no
question that Wagtails are far more pleasing when kept in
aviaries than in cages; excepting in the case of hand-reared
birds which are permitted to fly about the house for a great part
of each day (such home pets being naturally by far the most
charming). Of the Wagtails which I kept for a time in cages,
in order to study the spring development of their summer
plumage were examples of the Pied, Grey, and Yellow species;
and I convinced myself that the changes took place by a gradual
growth of colour in the feathers, none of which were ever
moulted out at that season.
I first began to take delight in the Wagtails in my birds'-
nesting days (between 1871 and 1886) when I was fortunate
enough to secure nests of the Pied, Grey, Blue-headed, and
Yellow Wagtails in Kent. As regards the White Wagtail which
I saw on more than one occasion, it is possible that I may have
taken the nest; but, without seeing the bird go off it, could not
distinguish it from that of its near relative the Pied Wagtail.
The Blue- or Grey - headed Wagtail I saw on several
occasions in company with the Yellow, flitting about deserted
brick-fields where the excavations had filled with water and the

intersecting paths were densely grass-grown, and upon saltings
dotted with clumps of a tough reedy grass: it was in the latter
place that my nest was obtained. I have never kept this species
in cage or aviary, but my friend Mr. Staines of Anerley had a
fine example some few years ago.
As an aviary bird I have found the Yellow species (lMotacilla
rail) the least aggressive and the Grey (M. melanope ) the most so ;
but from what other bird-owners have told me I conclude that
some examples of the Pied species (M. lugubris) are capable of
terrorising birds far superior to themselves in strength and
weight, and my own experience of associating this bird with my
first Grey Wagtail resulted in the death of the latter, which was
repeatedly driven from the food-dish until literally starved.
Towards tiny birds, like Blue-tits or Waxbills, I found the Grey
Wagtail especially malevolent; pinning them down on their
backs with one foot and viciously pecking them.
The most suitable companions for Wagtails are the smaller
Weavers, Java Sparrows, or other finches with powerful beaks--
such as Buntings, and the smaller Doves: I never knew them to
interfere with any of these, yet I have heard of a Pied Wagtail
completely dominating a Blackbird.
I first saw these birds in captivity many years before I
took up the study of aviculture in an aviary at the end of the
old fish-house at our Zoological Gardens. This first induced me,
when furnishing one of my covered aviaries, to introduce a
stream at the back of the enclosure with shelving sandy banks
running down to the water, backed up by flags and the water
Celandine. My Wagtails used to run down this bank to bathe,
frequently floating off out of their depth; but by slightly open-
ing their wings and tails they easily and gracefully swam round
upon the surface and regained the bank. Unhappily a little Cole-
tit was less at home in the element and I found it floating dead
upon the surface of the water, which induced me to do away with
this arrangement.
I11 later years I believe the Pied and Grey Wagtails were
successfully crossed at our Gardens, and I understand that the
hybrids proved to be fertile: if this is actually the case, it would
seem that the Wagtails might prove as interesting a study for the
mule-breeder as the Doves, Ducks and Pheasants.

Miss R. Anderson,
That there is no difficulty in hand-rearing Wagtails, and
that they make the most intelligent and delightful of house-pets
I proved in 1892 in the case of the Pied species ; and a corres-
pondent to the " Feathered World*' had a similar experience a
year or two ago with the Yellow Wagtail: the late Dr. Bradburn's
failure to rear these birds was doubtless due to the fact that he
gave the nestlings meat, instead of confining himself to biscuit,
egg, ants' egg and dried flies : that a little ground lentils would
not be injurious seems evident, from the fact that I mixed a
certain quantity of Abrahams' food with my mixture.* 1

By Miss Rosie Alderson.
I always think of my collection of birds in their various
aviaries as if they were a small village, with all the events that go
to make up life taking place amidst them just the same as if they
were human beings.
For birds have their various characters just the same as
people--good, bad, and indifferent--their loves and hates are
very genuine, as well as their other characteristics.
With the nesting birds some parents are so kind-hearted
that they will not only be devoted to their own young ones, but
to other birds' young ones as well, whilst others seem to weary of
their nestlings and forsake or neglect them without scruple. Just
at this time I have a pair of Bronzewings bringing up a forsaken
young Half-collared Turtle with their own young bird, and it
was put in the nest when the difference in plumage would at
once be noticed by the old birds. Yet the Bronzewings, so far
from resenting the stranger, are taking every care of it.
But it is not about Doves I am going to tell you but about
my Barnard's Parrakeets. Some years ago.I bought a pair of
these lovely birds for, if I remember rightly, 60/-, at that time
they were dearer than they are now. Both were fine birds, and
the cock " Barnie" was the prettiest specimen of his kind I have
ever seen.
* Mr. Abrahams assured me that he did not use pea-meal, so he probably sub-
stituted lentils.

Most of you will know this Parrakeet at least by sight, but
those of you who have not seen it may like to hear what it is
like. Barnard's Parrakeets are always great favourites of mine,
their colouring is so very lovely and their shape so elegant. In
size this bird is larger, and considerably thicker in build than a
Cockatiel. The general colour is bright green, with a red fore-
head, and a yellow band round the back of the neck, and also
one across the breast. The upper back and shoulder-butts are of
the richest blue. The long tail is green, while the under-
feathers are also blue but paler than the back, and of the most
lovely shading imaginable. When"Barnie" started to whistle
he would open his tail like a fan, and jerk it very rapidly from
side to side. It was only when he did this that one could seethe
lovely blue of the tail feathers in all their beauty.
This is only a brief description, but you will see from it
what a very handsome bird a Barnard's Parrakeet is, and how
great an ornament to any aviary. Some day, if you get a
specimen for yourself, you will see how futile it is to try and
describe such a lovely bird, for it must be seen to be realized.
I was very delighted with my new purchase and turned
them into a large cage. Visions of nesting and young Barnard's
floated through my brain, for every bird-lover knows how in bird-
keeping one's thoughts run away with one. Many a castle I have
built in the air has come tumbling down with a crash, and the
case of the Barnard's proved no exception to the rule.
When the warm weather came I put the Barnard's out into
a compartment in my new aviary. Here they had plenty of
room to fly about, or nest at will, with but few companions.
Amongst these however was my favourite Masked Parrakeet
" Dick Turpin." How I wish everyone who reads these lines
could see " Dick." He is the brightest, most loving and
intelligent Parrakeet you can imagine, and not only is he very
lovely, but his ways are so pretty no one can resist him. Imagine
a magnificent bird eighteen inches long in colour light emerald
green, the green so rich that it fairly seems to shine. " Dick"
has a black mask over his face and wonderful orange eyes. The
quill feathers of his wings are bright blue, and his breast is
yellow, shading into deep orange. I could write you pages about

Miss R. Arderson,
" Dick," how, if I do not notice him, he will put on a most
pathetic limp, and then, when he is perched on my wrist, he will
almost go to sleep in my arms with his head under my coat
collar, fluffing out his feathers and crooning with joy all the time.
Or, if in a lively mood, he will play at hide and seek on the
aviary shelves, always giving a jump and a little cry of pleasure
when he is "found." He will let me handle him as I will, and
never makes the least attempt to bite, even letting me take any-
thing out of his beak or pick him up bodily. As I say, I could
write you pages about the charms of " Dick," but this story is
about the Barnard's. Mrs. Barnard was a very beautiful bird,
but she had a great failing common to her sex, in human beings
as well as in birds--an intense love of admiration. She carried
this to such an excess that, if any fresh inmate was introduced
into the aviary, she at once put on all her charms and graces to
captivate the new comer.
Seeing " Dick" is so handsome it is little wonder she set
her heart on making him her slave. She put on a bold air and
soon could do what she liked with him, for "Dick" is most
"asy going until his jealousy is aroused, and the?i woe betide the
offender. In the days when I kept him in the same aviary as my
other Masked Parrakeet "Jack," I could never take much notice
of the latter, "Dick" would be sure to attack him, though
strange to say he would never try to bite me, but would rather be
especially affectionate, as if he tried to tell me it was all done out
of affection for me. It was a great pity, for I am sure these
Masks are a true pair. I have them still, but they live in
separate aviaries.
If one had not felt so sorry for " Barnie " it really would
have been amusing to watch Mrs. Barnard and " Dick." I have
even seen her come up to him as he was eating his biscuit and
take it from him, and all the protest " Dick" would make would
be merely a mild grunt of disapproval, though if the offender had
been any other bird it would probably have been promptly
punished.
Matters went on like this for some time without anything
serious happening, and then at last the climax came. I suppose
poor " Barnie" must have felt he could stand it no longer, for it

ended in a fierce fight and the injured husband got the worst of
it, the hen being quite unhurt. I was out when it happened, and
when I came in I found " Barnie " with a cut on his head, behind
the aviary door, and looking very wretched.
I put him in a cage, as matters were evidently too serious
to leave the birds together, and considered what I should do
next. At last I decided on getting another hen, for I felt very
angry with the culprit and thought it would do her good to feel
she was not the only hen Barnard in existence. I thought
"Barnie" would take gladly to a new mate, but here I was
mistaken, so great an affection had he for his faithless wife that
he deeply resented the new arrival, in spite of her being a lovely
bird with a very sweet whistle. I let the new comer out with
" Barnie" in another compartment of the aviary, and to my great
disappointment he flew at her and fought her with angry cries,
so savage was he that after one or two attempts I had to finally
separate them. It is a splendid sight to see two Barnards fight-
ing, their wings and tails spread, their colour flashing like
jewels--but it has its serious side, for unless checked it means
death or wounding to the combatants. You may have noticed
that when Parrakeets fight they will always try to seize or bite
that part of each other which is the least protected by feathers,
namely, the head, feet, or legs. I have had a parrakeet (if I
remember rightly, a Java) die from a fearful wound in the head,
which was just gripped, the bite piercing the eye to the brain;
and once another bird died from a wound in the foot, caused, I
believe, by "Dick" in the first instance. I11 this last case I
dressed the foot and it stopped bleeding, and put the bird in a
quiet cage, hoping it might recover, but the wound must have
broken out afresh, for later I found it dead, evidently from shock
and loss of blood.
But to return to the Barnards--here I was with three birds
and all of them disagreeing. I decided on parting with the new
hen, and after I had done so this bird won her new owner the
Society's medal for the first instance of this parrakeet breeding
in England. The old pair I put back in their original cage, with
a sliding wire partition between, so that they could see but not
fight each other. After some months the Barnards became

Miss R. Aederson,
reconciled, and I let them out together. It is true they seemed
indifferent to each other, and their affection was gone, but still
they lived on quite friendly terms, and never showed any signs
of fighting.
After a long time I turned them out again, not into the
same compartment as "Dick" but in the same aviary. Dick
had quite forgotten his old love, and I hoped all might go
smoothly, but I ought to have known that few parrots either
forget or forgive.
Directly the hen Barnard caught sight of Dick, though she
could not get at him, all her old hatred for her husband returned,
and she at once turned on him again. As I saw poor "Barnie's"
life would really be in danger, I took the lieu away, and tired of
her persistent bad behaviour I parted with her. " Barnie " I
kept for long. He was such a pretty bird, and would take
biscuit from my fingers readily, but he never recovered his
spirits, and always seemed brooding over his wrongs and his
lost love. Not unnaturally he hated " Dick," and would con-
tinually try to fight him through the wires. So great was his
animosity that he even tried to fight my other Masked when it
was put in the same aviary, though the poor bird was entirely
ignorant of the quarrel.
Eventually I parted with "Barnie" too, so the only actor
I have left in this avian tragedy is " Dick," who is so light-
hearted that I think he must have quite forgotten the misery he
caused; but he never troubles about anything, and makes him-
self so endearing that we have to forgive all his sins.
And now having told you a sad story of life in my bird
village I will tell you of a happier one.
Some years ago I had three little Cactus Conures, " Ping,"
"Pong," and "Jock." They were the merriest little trio im-
aginable, and would play with each other like children. "Jock "
was quite an amateur actor, and would make the most dreadful
faces and go through the drollest antics in front of " Ping" and
"Pong"--the two latter always sitting solemnly before him in
the character of audience. If a larger enemy, notably the wicked
hen Barnard, showed signs of attack the three small birds would
band together, and always succeeded in driving her off. All

three Cactus were most friendly, and would all be climbing about
my arms and shoulders at once; indeed I always had to be sure
and count them before I left the aviary for fear I carried one out
on my back by mistake. This nearly happened once, for the
Cactus are so small and light they can easily cling to one's coat
without being noticed. One summer I put these three Couures
into an aviary with the Long-tailed Glossy Starlings, and to my
great surprise after a time the two Couures Ping and Pong
started to nest. They had never done so in the other aviary,
though I had had them for some time. The eggs which were
very small, round, and white, were laid in a wooden nest box of
the closed kind I always use for Parrakeets.
Unfortunately all the eggs came to grief but one, and this
precious survivor was most jealously guarded. The pair began
to sit very steadily, and my hopes ran high, for I do not think
there is a known case of this little Conure breeding in England.
Jock who was most generously devoted to the other two, took
upon himself to guard the entrance hole from the Starlings, who
were suspected, and I think rightly, of knowing something about
the fate of the other eggs. Jock did his duty most thoroughly,
and even made faces at me if I came too near, and refused ofteuer
than not any little dainties I offered him when on duty. The
pair would often sit on the egg together and matters seemed
proceeding very smoothly ; the Starlings, probably through the
watchful care of Jock, apparently giving up their bad designs.
One day I was much amused with Jock, he had been persuaded
to so far relax as to take a piece of his favourite biscuit and had
evidently much enjoyed it. I am sure birds have a language of
their own, for Jock promptly told Ping and Pong to come out
and get some biscuit too, assuring them that he would look after
the precious egg. The little pair came out and took their tit-
bits, going into the flight to eat. Jock clearly felt his great
responsibility, and not content with guarding the hole, crept into
the nest, and made the most valiant efforts to sit upon the egg.
I watched him through the hole, and was amused to see how
many times he failed before he got the egg under him to his
satisfaction. Of course when the pair returned he retired in
their favour, but continued to watch as jealously as before.

The Kagu in Captivity.
In spite of all this devotion the egg failed to hatch. Per-
haps it was the turning and turning Jock had given it that did
the mischief, I do not know. I shall never have the chance
again, for this happiest of little trios is dispersed. Ping and
Pong both died, I believe from taking cold. They were not ill
for long, and quickly followed each other. Jock still flourishes,
but he will no longer perch on me as of old. He was always the
shyest of the three. He misses the others sadly, and some-
times goes through his quaint performances, but not often. It
is rather sad in a way to see him acting, he looks such a forlorn
and pathetic little figure, and one misses his friendly little
audience. They were a small trio, who found life "a very
pleasant thing" and their one joy was their mutual pleasure in
each other's existence.
I don't pretend to paint a moral, but there is one, if you
choose to find it, in both these true stories from my bird village,
but if you prefer the jam without the powder don't look for it.
THE KAGU IN CAPTIVITY.
In the last number of our esteemed contemporary the
Emu, appears an account of that very interesting and aberrant
type from New Caledonia known as the Kagu (.Rhinochehis
jubatus&apos;), a cut of which we print herewith.
About a year ago the British Museum received some eggs
laid by some captive Kagus belonging to Mr. H. E. Finckli of
Sydney, and the present writer corresponded with Mr. Finckli
with the object of obtaining some notes and possibly photo-
graphs of these curious birds for the Aviculhiral Magazine. Mr.
Finckli had however just given his notes to the editor of
the Emu, but he wrote " I shall be pleased to send you some
photos, of my birds which you are at liberty to publish.
. . . I am much longing for the autumn when I shall again be
able to try my luck at rearing a chick. It is heart-breaking to
succeed in hatching a bird after three years work and then only
to put into spirits. Anyhow I have great hopes for next year. I
have four birds, but unfortunately cannot get others, hard as I

have tried. I have a standing offer of forty guineas for two of
my birds, but I am so attached to them that I could not part with
one. They seem to be part of the family, and are as tame and
playful as kittens, coming readily to my call, and being always
ready to play with the children. . . . My photos, will follow

However the promised photographs have never arrived,
but an account of the Kagus, written by Mr. A. J. Campbell, has,
as before mentioned, appeared in the April number of the Emu.
The Kagu appears to be perfectly hardy and to thrive in cap-
tivity, its food consisting of finely cut beefsteak which must be
perfectly fresh. Large centipedes, five inches in length, are
freely eaten, the squirming creature being passed " by a nibbling

action quickly through the bill crosswise and back a couple of
times until it was pulped, then swallowed." The birds fight by
pecking at each other's legs. The moult occurs about mid-
summer.
" Mr. Finckh was favoured in getting a pair of his Kagus to
breed. They commenced nesting in a hollow on the ground in
a secluded part of the aviary, into which they threw a few
coarse sticks and leaves for a day or two. When the egg was
laid more sticks were placed about it. The male sits continuously
on the single egg, but his mate may relieve him occasionally,
possibly at night. The birds defend their nest vigorously. Mr.
Finckh reckoned his birds were about seven years old when they
commenced to lay. It was observed that the egg was laid four-
teen days after ' mating,' and that incubation lasted five weeks."
An egg laid on the 15th of September chipped on the 19th
of October and the chick hatched two days later, but died when
three days old. Normally the birds lay but one egg in the year,
but if this is taken they lay again.
"The egg," remarks Mr. Campbell, "is a stout ellipse in
shape ; surface slightly glossy ; shell comparatively fine ; stony-
grey in colour, moderately marked with spots and blotches of
amber and dull grey, the latter colour underlying the surface of
the shell. Except for its fine texture and elliptical shape the
Kagu's egg might be taken for that of a Gull. Dimensions in
inches 2% by 2 inches."
The Kagu has been kept in our Eoudon Zoological Gar-
dens, and it was there that the late Mr. A. D. Bartlett noticed its
affinity to the Sun Bittern of South America ( Eurypyga ) which
anatomical investigation has since shown to be its nearest relative.
It is about equal in size to an ordinary fowl, in colour
mostly light grey, and the wings, when expanded, are seen to be
conspicuously spotted with white, reddish brown and black.
The bill, legs and irides are bright red.
Although numerous in New Caledonia upon its discovery
when the French occupied the island in 1S52, it is at the present
time very scarce, and bids fair to become extinct before many
years unless measures are speedily taken for its preservation.

The fourth International Ornithological Congress, which
was opened at the Imperial Institute on June the 12th, is now a
thing of the past, and, by those who had the good fortune to take
part in it, will be long remembered as an extremely delightful
and instructive gathering.
The proceedings opened with an informal reception by
the President, Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, on Monday evening, June
12th. On the following day a General Meeting was held at
which the President gave a history of the Natural History
branch of the British Museum from its earliest days. In the
afternoon the first of the Sectional Meetings was held. Section
IV. was devoted to Economic Ornithology and Bird Protection.
Mr. J. Digby Piggott read a paper on the present state of the
law regarding the Protection of Birds in the United King-
dom, and pointed out the general state of confusion that existed,
one species being protected while it was absent from our country
and not when it was present. O11 the whole, however, good had
resulted. Sir John Cockburn described the Protection laws in
Australia, which grouped the species into three classes, namely,
those that were protected throughout the entire year, those that
had protection during the breeding season, and those that were
"outlaws" and were granted no protection, amongst which was
the Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. Mr. F. E. Lemon, of the Bird
Protection Society, dealt with the same subject. In the evening
a social gathering of the members was held at the Naval,
Shipping and Fisheries Exhibition at Earl's Court.
O11 Wednesday (June 14th) at a general meeting Mr.
Frank Chapman of New York read a paper, which was illus-
trated by lantern slides, entitled " What Constitutes a Museum
Collection of Birds?" He showed the excellent arrangments
adopted in America, but remarked that our National Museum
exceeded anything he had seen in its instructive value. Dr. J.
Dwight, also from the United States, treated of " Some Phases
in Feather Wear." He exhibited a series of excellent micro-
photographic slides, showing the development of feathers, and
explained how the change from dull winter plumage to the

bright garb of spring is generally due to abrasion. Dr. Otto
Herman, from Budapest, contributed a most interesting paper on
" Migration," which was read in English by Mme. Ginever. The
arrival of the Swallow was noted, 011 special post-cards, by some
6,000 observers,which covered the whole area of Hungary. The
points of observation were geographically determined and maps
prepared showing the exact points of arrival on different days.
The result showed that the arrivals commenced on March 10th,
being noted at three points. On March 30th the culminating
point had been reached, 343 points being noted. Then the num-
bers began to decrease and 011 May 22nd only 15 points were
noted. By such observations on various species it was a simple
matter to determine the direction taken by the migrating birds,
and it was found that the Swallow arrives in Hungary from the
South, the White Stork travels from South-East to North-West,
the Wagtail from West to East, the Woodcock from South-West
to North-East,and the Cuckoo from South-East to North-West.
Mr. W. P. Pycraft contributed a very important paper on
"Nestling Birds in relation to Evolution." He came to the
conclusion from a study of a large series of nestlings, that all
birds were at one time arboreal. Those that had from various
causes taken to nesting on the ground had become nudifugous,
while those that continued to nest in trees produced naked and
helpless young. The author showed the great importance of
studying the young of various birds, about many of which very
little is known. Mr. Frank Chapman's papers on the life-
history of the American Flamingo and the Brown Pelican were
illustrated by perhaps the best series of bird slides that have
ever been seen in this country. The author had visited breeding
colonies of both species, the former in the Bahamas and the
latter in Florida. He had erected screens in the centre of the
colonies and thus obtained photographic records of the whole
history of the nesting birds. The colouring of these slides, done
by the author himself, was most beautiful, and probably better
than anything of the kind that has been seen before.
O11 Thursday the members of the Congress proceeded by
special train to Tring, as the guests of the Hon. Walter
Rothschild. The world-famed Museum was first visited, after

which the members assembled in the Victoria Hall to listen to
an extremely interesting paper by Mr. Rothschild on " Extinct
and Vanishing Birds," which was illustrated by a wonderful
collection of specimens and drawings. Mr. Rothschild divided
his paper into three headings, namely, birds that were already
extinct; those on the verge of extinction ; and those threatened
with extinction at no very distant date.
After luncheon the members divided into three groups ;
one proceeding in brakes to the reservoir, the home of many wild-
fowl, notably the Great-crested Grebe ; a second party went into
the park to see the Emeus and Kangaroos ; while a third visited
the gardens and greenhouses. The members will have a lasting
recollection of Mr. Rothschild's splendid collection and the
great work that he is doing.
On Friday Dr. Wilson of the Discovery Antarctic Expe-
dition gave an interesting account of Antarctic birds, illustrated
by excellent photographic slides. Dr. Hartert contributed a
masterly paper on " The principal Aims of Modern Ornithology,"
and Mr. Bonhote read his paper 011 " Experiments in Hybridizing
Ducks," which was of very great interest. I11 the afternoon the
members of the Congress were received by the Lord Mayor and
Lady Mayoress at the Mansion House, and in the evening the
foreign members were the guests of the British Ornithologists'
Union at a dinner held at the Frascati Restaurant.
O11 Saturday morning Dr. Bruce read his paper, which
was illustrated by some beautiful photographic slides, on the
ornithological work accomplished by the Scottish Antarctic
Expedition, the most noteworthy of the slides being those
illustrating the nesting of the so-called Cape Pigeon (Daption
capensis&apos;). Although a very common species in the Southern
Seas, the nest of this Petrel had never before been discovered.
The only paper strictly devoted to aviculture was that read
by Mr. D. Seth-Smith, on " The Importance of Aviculture as an
aid to the Study of Ornithology." The author pointed out that
cabinet ornithology, although of the utmost importance, taught
nothing of the life-habits of birds, and in the case of many
species it was next to impossible to study their nesting habits
satisfactorily without keeping the birds under close observation

in aviaries in which their natural surroundings were reproduced
as nearly as possible. He remarked upon the valuable work
that had been done by Mr. Meade-Waldo in his discoveries with
regard to the changes of plumage in some of the Sand-grouse,
and in the method they adopt to carry water to their young.
The author also described the breeding habits of the Tataupa
Tinamou, which species had been shown to be polyandrous, and
of two species of Turnix , from observations made in his aviaries.
The chairman of this section, Mr. Meade-Waldo, remarked upon
the great difference which existed between scientific aviculture
and mere bird-fancy, and pointed out how many important points
could be settled by aviculturists.
A general meeting concluding the business of the Congress
was held on Saturday afternoon, and it was announced that the
permanent Congress Committee had decided that the next Con-
gress should be held in 1910, in Berlin or other city in Germany,
and that Dr. Reiclrenow should be invited to be the President.
On Monday (June 19th) the members of the Congress
journeyed to Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire, where they were the
guests of His Grace the Duke of Bedford, and enjoyed one of
the most delightful days it is possible to conceive. The Mammals
and Birds in the park form perhaps the finest collection in the
world. There is a flock of twenty Pere David's Deer, of which
only one other specimen exists in Europe. European and
American Bison, Grevy's Zebras,. Giraffes and Prejevalsky's
Horses are amongst the rarer Mammals; wdiile among the birds
were to be seen European Flamingos, some actually swimming
on the lake; Upland Geese (in flocks) ; Trumpeter Swans, with
young in white down ; a large flock of Whooper Swans, several
pairs of Black Swans with young ; Cranes of several species ;
Ducks of many species ; Bornean Fireback Pheasants, Vulturine
Guinea-fowls, Ostriches, Emeus (with young) and Rheas. A
flock of Australian Crested Doves were flying loose in the
grounds.
On Tuesday the members proceeded to Cambridge, where
they were met by Professor Newton, who showed them a fine
series of eggs of the Great Auk and many rare bird-skins. The
Museum and Eibrary fully^ occupied the members until two

o'clock wlien lunch was served in Magdalene College. Professor
Newton in replying to the toast of his health remarked that he
thought that the members had come to Cambridge with the
laudable intention of birds'-nesting. They had come to the
place where the nest was made and the egg was laid which
hatched into the Ibis, which as everybody knows is the famous
journal of the British Ornithologists' Union. After lunch the
members were invited by Mr. Bonliote to visit his aviaries at
Fen Ditton, and a large number availed themselves of this
opportunity of inspecting his fine collection of Ducks, Waders,
Herons, Owls, Gulls, &amp;c. After tea the party drove to the
station and the greater number left for Bridlington, Yorkshire,
which was reached about midnight. The following morning an
early start was made for the cliffs of Flamborough Head and
Bempton, the breeding place of innumerable Guillemots, Razor-
bills, Puffins and Kittiwakes. This is one of the very few places
at which cliff-climbers can be seen at work collecting the eggs
on the face of the precipitous cliffs which reach a height of some
three and four hundred feet. Several descents were made by the
climbers while the members of the Congress were present, and
the sight was one that will not be easily forgotten. Most of the
members returned to town the same evening while a few
remained until the following day.

Sir,-- I see in your June issue that Mr. Wiener writes about an
offer made by The Feathered World, to him and many others, of the foreign
bird section of Cassell's "Canaries and Cage-birds." He was "amused at
receiving a printed offer".and there follows the part to
which I take special objection, viz., " Had a reprint been intended," etc.
In the circular sent out I cannot see that I in any way suggest that the
book was reprinted, and in case any of those who have had a copy may
think the same, I should be glad if you would allow me to state that the
book was not reprinted--the copies being those that Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co.
had on hand. I may say Mr. Wiener wrote in the same way to me. I
returned him his money and explained it was not a reprint. Whereupon
he again remitted his money, saying he would have a copy. Under these
circumstances it is, to say the least of it, bad taste on Mr. Wiener's part to
have written as he has in your columns.
I enclose a circular so that you may see what the details were, and I
think you will agree with me that nothing was said which could have led
Mr. Wiener to his conclusion. E. Comyns-Lewer.
[There appears to have been a slight misunderstanding. Mr. Wiener
informs us that had the date of publication (some 27 years ago) been printed
on the circular, he would have taken no notice of it beyond ordering a copy
out of curiosity.--E d.].

fine sieve mixed with chopped green-food and crashed biscuit into a crumbly
state. Add also scalded ants' eggs and dried flies to the mixture, and give
canary and millet seed, also well-scoured gentles and any other small insects
obtainable. As they get older and get feathered this animal food will be
less necessary, but at first is very important. Frank Finn.
BLUE BONNETS.
Sir, --I almost wonder that Mrs. Hartley, as she is an aviculturist, had
not observed how long young parrots take before they can go on to seed.
Had she at once liand-fed her Blue-bonnets with sop or moistened biscuit,
they would probably have been alive now.
I have just had some Senegals (pceocephalus) from France. They had
nothing but seed in their cage, and appeared fully fledged. I was not at
home, but fortunately my man observed they were making no hand at the
seed and gave them sop, which they greedily devoured. And yet there is no
trace of nesting feathers about them. Many years ago a friend had a dusky
Pionus from Guiana. You would never have supposed the bird was not
feeding on seed. But I saw it was not doing well, and gave it bread and
milk, to which it took eagerly, and soon became strong.
I am convinced that Parrots need soft food much longer than most
young birds. Even sick adults can often be recovered by stuffing them
with sop. I have brought back Parrots which were in the very jaws of
death with it. F. G. Dutton.
Sir, --In answer to Mrs. Hartley's request for information from
purchasers of Blue Bonnets, as to whether any of the lot imported last
March had survived, I write to sa}&amp;quot; I bought a pair out of a lot of eight at
the end of that month (27th) ; they were then in very good condition,
though of course rather dirty. Mine were kept in a cage about a fortnight
and then turned out in an outdoor aviary, where they soon cleaned them-
selves and seemed very happy. They soon paired, and I hoped were going
to nest; when about ten days ago the hen bird drooped and seemed half
paraE'zed one afternoon, and the next was dead. The cock did not seem to
miss her very much, and continues to look in perfect health and in beautiful
plumage, and sings after his fashion daily. They have been fed always with
oats, canary, hemp and millet, and had groundsel and shepherd's purse
given daily. I did not notice that the other Blue Bonnets in the cage I
bought mine out of were younger than mine, and, as far as I know, they
never have much blue on their heads, and what they have is next the beak,
so that the name Blue Bonnets is rather misleading--Bonnets usually being
fixed more on the back of the head. Duncan Parker.
Sir, --111 reply to Mrs. Hartley's letter about Blue Bonnets in this
month's Magazine, I also purchased two of these birds at the beginning of
April. Their plumage was somewhat rough, but they seemed to be in fairly

good health on arrival. They were turned into a large cage in my heated
bird-room (kept by liot-water pipes at a temperature of 6o* to 70* Fall.), and
fed on canary and oats with fresh sea-sand and water daily. A piece of
cuttle-fish bone was hung in the cage. Nothing else was given. A week or
ten days after arrival one of the birds began to show signs of indisposition
and gradually became worse. I therefore separated them, put the healthy
bird in another cage and discontinued the oats. I may mention that the
healthy bird is now flying with other Parrakeets in an unheated loft aviary,
is coming into good plumage and will, I hope, be turned shortly into one
of my outdoor aviaries.
The invalid, however, became so weak that it could only with
difficulty mount its perch. It seemed incapable of supporting the weight
of its head. Its excreta were yellow and watery, and its breast-bone looked
like a razor under its feathers. It ate but not largely, and seemed to
appreciate the cuttle-fish bone. At this stage I sprinkled its seed with a
mixture of powdered chalk, dry arrowroot and bismuth. It was so ill that
I expected to find it dead every time I entered the bird-room, but after a
week or two of the above-mentioned treatment it began to get better and
now seems to be well on the way to recovery. My bird has undoubtedly
been suffering from enteritis which may have been due to septicaemia. I
therefore fed it as simply as possible. If the death of Mrs. PIartle3 ,, 's birds
was due to the same cause, I think it would have been better to withhold
the yolk of egg, which has been shown by Dr. Creswell to be especially
favourable to the propagation and the development of the virulence of the
bacilli of septicaemia. I have been an aviculturist for nearly thirty years,
but these are the first Blue Bonnets which I have possessed.
I should be very glad to hear whether any of our members have kept
Brown's Parrakeets with other birds, and, if so, what their behaviour has
been towards the other inmates of the aviary. I have had a pair in an out-
door aviary by themselves for the last twelve months, but, unless they show
some inclination to breed, shall be disinclined to allow them to continue its
sole occupants. T. N. Wilson.

an extent with a tomahawk, I decided to take the bird, which had only a
few feathers. For the first few days after being brought to Melbourne it was
fed 011 honey diluted with water, injected down its throat with a small glass
syringe. The little thing soon learnt to feed itself from a saucer, and was
110 trouble to rear. Nothing delights it more than to be handled and played
with ; its antics on the swing are most amusing. It is now in full plumage,
the rusty markings just appearing on the nape and back. Occasionally it
says a few words, learnt from a Rosella Parrakeet whose cage hangs near.
The breeding season in Victoria appears to be far advanced in October, as
two or three nests found by our party on the same occasion contained fairly
well grown j&apos;oung, always two in number. These birds were very numerous
in the district, and were in company with G. pusillus. Lately they are very
numerous round Melbourne, having been seen in the parks, gardens, etc.,
feeding from the flowering gums. The favourite nest-site seems to be about
18 inches from the opening down the main trunk of a green tree in open
forest. The birds quickly betray their nest by harsh screeching, and only
have to be watched for a few minutes in order to detect the nest.-- Fred.

Sir, --The following letter from Mrs. Gorter seems to me of sufficient
interest to merit publication in the Magazine. As I have pointed out
(British Birds, Vol. II. p. 68) a similar change sometimes takes place during
the moult in our European Goldfinch ; but, as the strength of the bird
increases during the spring months the golden yellow on the head gradually
deepens to crimson. It is quite likely that this may happen in the case of
Mrs. Gorter's Gouldian-fincli. A. G. ButeER.

Sir,--M r. Horatio R. Fillmer, in your last issue of the Magazine,
*doubts, on the authority of some medical men, the possibility of birds
*contracting such diseases as Consumption and Typhoid; and, therefore,
requests me to give him the reasons for my having made the statement in
the extempore address which I gave the members of the Sheffield Cage-
Bird Society in February last, that, birds "could easily contract such
diseases as Typhoid, Consumption and Diphtheria."
Now, in the first place, let me assure your correspondent that I do
not claim to be "an authority" on the diseases of birds, but that he is quite
welcome to get the result of my experience as a humble member of the
Medical profession aucLa lover of foreign birds.
Some time back, the death-rate amongst my birds being rather high,
I decided to place the fresh arrivals in quarantine and watch them. As the
result of my vigilance I soon discovered that some of the new arrivals were
in bad health, and, on their dying, I made a post-mortem and bacterio-
logical examination, and found the cause of death in two Gouldian Finches
to be due to "Avian Tuberculosis," and in two Budgerigars and one Parson
Finch to "Diphtheria Avium." Since that period, and in the same way, I
found out that two Canaries died from Avian Tuberculosis and another
Budgerigar from Diphtheria. In the consumptive cases the livers and
spleens (not the lungs) were found to be swarming with the bacilli of
Tuberculosis Avium ; and, in the diphtheria cases, the false membranes in
the throats of the birds distinctly showed the modified organisms known as

According to Professor K. Noeard of the Alfort Veterinary College
(one of the best authorities on the subject) " Tuberculosis is a common
disease among birds: the bacilli are a little longer than those met with in
Tuberculosis Mammalia, otherwise they have the same characteristics,
react in the same way to the same stains, and flourish on the same culture
media, but they are more vigorous and grow more quickly and abundantly."
And Hewlett (another authority) points out, that, the bacilli in the form of
Tuberculosis are exceedingly numerous in the lesions. Dr. Charles Porter
(Lecturer in Bacteriology, University College, Sheffield) assures me that
Pigeons are not the only birds that suffer from Diphtheria Avium, but that
Parrots and Parrakeets are very susceptible to it; and, that, Chicken
Cholera (different altogether from Human Asiatic Cholera) creates great
ravages among both large and small birds.

I have not had any personal experience of Typhoid fever among my
birds, nor have I ever seen any modified form of the Bacillus of Eberth
under the microscope; but Drs. Greene and Butler and Wallace mention
this disease in their works.
I am sony that want of time prevents me from going into this inter-
esting subject more fully; but, I think, I have written enough to convince
most of the readers of the Magazine that certain very infectious forms of
diseases exist amongst birds, and that therefore all newly bought birds
should be kept in quarantine for a reasonable time before they are put into
the aviary with the other birds.
And, in conclusion, let me earnestly appeal to all those members of
our Society who have bird-rooms or aviaries to see that they are efficiently
ventilated.

BREEDING.
Sir, --I am glad to say that I have reared two nice young Virginian
Cardinals, now flying in aviary; and a Red-winged Parrakeet is sitting on
fertile eggs. M. Hawke.
AUSTRALIAN FINCHES.
Mr. J. B. Housdeu of Brooklyn, Cator Road, Sydenham, informs us
that he has, flying in his aviaries, some twelve hundred Australian Finches,
consisting chiefly of Red- and Black-headed Gouldians, Star-Finches
(Bathilda ruficauda ), Long-tailed, Pectoral, Masked, and Bichenos. He
would be pleased to show them to any member of the Avicultural Society.

We have received from the Zoological Society of London a set of
their new series of picture post-cards illustrating a number of the mammals
and birds in the Society's Gardens. These are admirable reproductions of
Mr. W. P. Dando's photographs, and form an extremely interesting series of
animal pictures. Considering their quality the price of these cards is very
moderate; a set of twenty can be obtained for tenpence, or a dozen for
sixpence, from the Society's Offices, No. 3, Hanover Square, W.

In conversation with onr Treasurer it was mentioned that
as a good many members had failed to pay their subscriptions
for the year it is feared that there may be a deficit when the
balance sheet is made up at the end of the year unless the
quality and number of the illustrations is reduced, and our
Treasurer suggested that probably many members would like to
repeat their kind donations to the Illustration Fund.
Our Honorary Business Secretary will be very glad to

RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Grim, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Cordon Bleu (Mr. Robertson). Found on floor of cage, unable to fly.
[The bird had evidently struck its head against the cage as the skull
was fractured. Your feeding was quite correct].
Cherry Finch hen (Mr. H. L. Sicli). [Your bird has been ailiug for
some while, there being evidence of long standing disease of both liver
and lungs. It was excessively emaciated and death was due to
exhaustion],
Madagascar Lovebird (Mr. Cummings). [Concussion of the brain caused
death].
Budgerigar (Miss Sturton-Johnson). [Your bird had peritonitis. The
black colour you noticed on abdomen was the black mortified bowel
showing through the thin skin of abdomen].
Gouldian Finch (Miss Newall). [Your bird died of pneumonia. I
certainly think freshly imported Gouldian Finches require a little
artificial heat for a while, especially during cold weather].

Bird (The Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton). Owing to bird being far

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
In the July number of this Journal for 1903 I recorded the
successful breeding in my aviaries of the Indian Turnix tanki.
the first of the Hemipodes, so far as I am aware, to be bred in
this country; * and I now have the satisfaction of recording a
like success with the fine Australian species, Turnix varia -the
Varied or Variegated Bustard Quail of some writers, the Painted
or Dotterel Quail of the Australian Colonists.
The adult female in this species, as in almost all of the
Hemipodes, is considerably larger than the male and her plu-
mage is beautifully marked. The feathers of the back are mostly
black, edged with whitish and barred with brown ; the back of
the neck bright chestnut, which forms into a conspicuous patch
at each side of the nape ; the wing coverts barred and spotted
with black, buff and chestnut; sides of face, throat, and eyebrow-
stripes white ; the feathers of the chest grey with whitish spots ;
breast and abdomen buffish. The iris bright red. Total length
about seven-and-a-half inches. The male is a little over six
inches in length and his plumage is much duller. The patches
of chestnut at the sides of the neck are dull and incon-
spicuous, and the chest is buff spotted with grey.
The Varied Turnix inhabits practically the whole of the
Australian Continent and Tasmania, the majority arriving in the
southern parts about September and leaving for the warmer
portions of the Continent in March.
* Two species-- T. lepurana and T. nigricollis--have been bred in Germany as recorded
in this Magazine for April and May 1905 (pp. 195-203, and 217-222).

Mr. D. Setii-Smith,
Gould writes "Among the game birds of Australia the
Varied Turnix plays a rather important part, for although its
flesh is not so good for the table as that of the little Partridge
and Quail, Synoicus australis and Coturiiix pectoralis, it is a bird
which is not to be despised when the game-bag is emptied at the
end of a day's sport, for it forms an acceptable variety to its con-
tents. Although it does not actually associate with either of the
birds mentioned above, it is often found in the same districts,
and all three species may be procured in the course of a
morning's walk in many parts of New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia, where it frequents sterile stony ridges,
interspersed with scrubby trees and moderately thick grass.
" It is also very common in all parts of Tasmania suitable
to its habits, hills of moderate elevation and of a dry stony
character being the localities preferred ; it is also numerous on
the sandy and sterile islands in Bass's Straits.
" It runs remarkably quickly, and when flushed flies low,
its pointed wings giving it much the appearance of a Snipe or
a Sandpiper. The breeding - season commences in August or
September and terminates in January, during which period at
least two broods are reared. The eggs are invariably four in
number, and are either deposited on the bare ground or in a
slightly constructed nest of grasses, placed in some shallow
depression, not unfrequently under the lea of a stone or at the
foot of a tuft of grass."
Mr. A. J. Campbell * informs us that, although found in
the same places as other Quails it is more local and prefers sandy
and somewhat sterile tracts. It runs much upon the ground,
and when on the wing has a wavering flight and is difficult to
shoot. " The breeding months are from September to February,
when two broods are probably reared. In Tasmania it is stated
that the chief months are October, November and December."
On March 22nd last I secured a pair of these birds, just
arrived from Australia, which were the first and only specimens
I had ever had an opportunity of obtaining, as, although this
species has been represented in the Zoological Society's collection
on two or three occasions, it is so rarely imported that I am

doubtful as to whether it has been kept before by private
aviculturists. The two birds arrived in good condition, though
somewhat rough in plumage, and were put into my warm aviary,
being allowed to run out on to a small grassed run on fine da3 r s.
They soon became quite tame and would run to me for meal-
worms, of which they are particularly fond. If they became
separated the female would call to her mate with the low booming
sound characteristic of the Hemipodes, but there was nothing
particularly interesting to note during the first few weeks after
arrival. Early in May, however, the booming note of the female
was heard frequently, and my diary contains the following note
for May 12th: "Noticed the female T, varia display to the male
by running backwards and forwards in front of him with tail
erect and crop puffed out like a pouter pigeon ; and discovered a
neat round hole, evidently intended for a nest, formed in some
hay and moss behind a few sticks in corner of aviary." O11 the
13th and 14th the female spent a good deal of time in the nest,
often twisting round on her breast with tail erect, and with her
bill pulling bits of hay around her and over her back to form a
dome. While on the nest she constantly uttered faint crooning
notes if the male was near, and if he went away to any distance
she immediately commenced to utter her booming call note.
About this time a very interesting habit, which appears to
be common to all of the Turnices, was first noticed, namely that
of the female calling the male to feed. It is well known that in
the true Game-birds the male, during the pairing season, when
he discovers a dainty grub or other tit-bit, holds it in his bill,
and, with a peculiar clucking note, calls his mate and presents
it to her. With the Turnices this habit is also indulged in, but
with the sexes reversed, the female, which is the larger and more
brilliantly-coloured bird, offering any specially dainty delicacy to
the male. A photograph, illustrating this habit was secured
which, although not suitable for reproduction, has enabled our
artist to prepare the plate which illustrates this paper.
My diary contains the following note for May 17th : " The
female constantly ' booming ' and displaying to her mate, the
display, as a rule, being performed thus: the male squats
amongst the grass, and the female runs round him in a circle

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
with tail more or less erected and crop extended and carried
close to the ground. Having run round him once or twice she
stands facing him at a distance of perhaps a foot or eighteen
inches and commences ' booming ' or * cooing' to him like a cock
pigeon, at the same time stamping and scratching with her feet,
while the male responds with a faint clucking note." The
"booming" of the female is a very curious proceeding, and I
have thought it worth while to have a text figure prepared from
a photograph I secured of the female in the act of uttering this
curious sound. She seems to puff out not only her crop but
also the upper back, so that the whole upper part of the body
represents a miniature balloon.

On May the 20th the nest was beautifully arched over and
completed, and on the following day the first egg was laid about
11 a.m. A second followed the next morning at 9.15 a.111., and
at 9.30 a.m. the male went onto the nest and busied himself in re-
arranging the hay dome, but did not appear to sit down on the
eggs. The third egg was laid on the 23rd, between 7.30 and
8.30 a.m., and a fourth the next day, probably about the same
time. The male was on the nest most of the day of the 24th, but
apparently did not commence to sit properly until the 25th, on
which day a fifth egg was laid. Four is the usual number of
eggs to a clutch in the case of all the Turnices, but some writers

have stated that clutches of five are sometimes found, which
statement the performance of my birds would seem to corrobo-
rate.
The eggs of the Turnices are very unlike those of the true
game-birds, being as a rule much more pointed at one end, and
spotted with two or three different colours. Those of Turnix
vatia are whitish, spotted, and blotched, especially at the larger
end, with slaty-blue and thickly spotted all over with minute
spots of light and dark brown. The eggs vary considerably in
shape, some being much more pointed than others, while in
some the markings are much darker than in others, although
laid by the same bird. The surface of the egg is glossy and
the average dimensions in inches ifs x -J.
On the morning of June 7th the male left the nest with
three chicks, the other two eggs, although fertile, failing to
hatch. Incubation had been completed in about thirteen days.
All through the period of incubation the female had taken 110
interest whatever in the nest, but had continued her booming
call, evidently with the object of attracting another male, for I
have no doubt, from careful observation of these birds that they,
like the Tinamous, are polyandrous, the female pairing
successively with several males during the breeding season. As
the female took no notice whatever of the young birds, keeping
in fact as far away from them as she could, except when she
approached to eat their food, I thought it best to confine the
male with his brood in a small run where the other occupants of
the aviary could not steal their food. In this they progressed
splendidly, their male parent brooding them most tenderly.
From the first they were fed on fresh ants' cocoons and small
gentles, the latter being eaten with the utmost relish. After the
first few days small particles of yolk of hard-boiled eggs were
readily eaten.
For the first week or ten days the young birds took every-
thing from the bill of their parent, never picking anything up
from the ground themselves.
The young, when first hatched, are covered with down of
a dark brown colour, with two stripes down the centre of the
back of a lighter shade ; a single line of light brown down the

back of the head, and narrow white stripes passing from the
base of the upper mandible over the eyes to the back of the head ;
chin and throat white.
They grow very rapidly, and at ten days old are able to fly.
On June 23rd, when sixteen days old, they were perfectly
feathered and capable of existence without their parent, who was
taken away from them and put back with the female. By the
first of July the young were equal in size to and in plumage
resembled the adult male, the only difference being that many
of their feathers retained the nestling-down at the tips.
As I have said, the female continued her booming call-
note while her mate was occupied with the cares of incubation,
and when he left the nest to feed she would immediately com-
mence to display to him and did not give him much peace until
he returned to the nest, when she would wander off and continue
her booming. This showed an evident desire to pair again,
which desire would without much doubt have been gratified had
there been a second male available. When the male was restored
to her after rearing the young, she commenced a search for a
new nesting site at once, and within three days had made a nest
and laid an egg, which was followed by three more during the
next three days. The cock however refused to sit, and I
imagine the eggs were infertile. Again the female made a nest
and laid the first egg of a third clutch on July 6th, the other
three being laid in various parts of the aviary. They were
collected and put into the nest but the male refused to sit. *
The reason for the male not sitting a second time may
have been that, being a polyaudrous species, the same male
would probably, under natural conditions, only be required to
incubate one clutch of eggs during the season.
When we consider the polyandrous habits of the
Hemipodes the question naturally arises as to what becomes of
the numerous progeny which must be hatched, and why is it
that the Bustard Quails are not extremely numerous in their
native countries ? It must be remembered, in the first place,
that whereas the true Quails lay from six to a dozen or more eggs
* A fourth nest was finished and the first egg laid on July 14th, and the male is now
(July 22nd) sitting steadily on four eggs.

By Arthur G. Butter, Ph.D., F.T.S., F.Z.S., &amp;c.
In my paper on the Grey-winged Ouzel in the June
number of the Magazine, after mentioning the fact that the hen
Blackbird, paired up with my male, had up to that time shown
no inclination to build, I stated that I did not yet despair.
About the second week of June I noticed that Merulcc
boulboul frequently pursued the hen, but I never observed either
bird carrying about building-material: after a heavy thunder-
storm I scraped the mud, mixed with dead leaves and twigs,
from the paths, and laid it in a heap under one of the trees in
the aviary; and it is evident that this was found useful by the
lien.
There can be little doubt that somewhere about the 10th
or nth of the month the Blackbird must have begun to build,
although I was profoundly ignorant of the fact: having all
materials handy, she would easily be able to complete a nest in
two days (I have knowm a Blackbird to finish its nest in a single
day under favourable circumstances, and I have known it to take
a week in the operation) ; but, as a general rule, nests built in my
garden have been completed in from two to three days.
I had seen but little of the hen for about a fortnight; but
this had not surprised me, as she is considerably more nervous
than her mate, skulking a good deal at the back of a platform of
branches placed high up at the hinder end of the aviary : it was
therefore with no little pleasure that I caught sight of her on
June 29th sitting in a nest built on one of the cross-bars of the
aviary just on a level with the above-mentioned platform. A
later examination of the nest showed that it was formed of hay
and twigs compacted with the mixture of mud and dead leaves
previously referred to, and lined with finer hay : being built on a

Dr. A. G. Butler,
cross-bar of tlie frame-work and against the wire it was semi-
circular in outline. As the back of this part of the aviary is
boarded up behind the wire, excepting a small space near the
ridge left for ventilation, and is protected above by glass, the
position of the nest was about the most sheltered in the aviary,
and evidences the intelligence of the builder.
As soon as I discovered the sitting bird, I set to work to
dig up some worms ; and the cock bird immediately flew down,
broke them up into fragments, and carried them straight to the
nest: this convinced me that the eggs must have already hatched.
In like manner, when I placed a beetle-trap in the aviary, the
clever bird took them one by one from this receptacle, broke off
their legs and left them lying about until he had secured about
half a dozen ; these he partly broke up, and with his bill filled
to its utmost capacity flew up to the nest.
I was not able to see whether the cock fed the young him-
self, or whether the hen took the food from him ; but, from the
rapidity with which he returned for further supplies, I thought it
probable that the latter was the arrangement followed.
From this time I began to supply a few worms every hour,
in addition to cockroaches and the usual soft food. When
utilizing the latter as nutriment for the young, I was interested
to notice that, as is the case with other birds, the cock carefully
selected only yolk of egg, with which he literally crammed his
bill: if this food were so injurious as it has been represented to
be, surely the instinct inherent in these creatures would not lead
them to select it alone, as a dainty suited to the delicate digestion
of baby birds.
On the 3rd July I first heard the voices of the young in
the nest, and was easily able to recognize three as the number of
birds hatched, one voice being much stronger than the two
others.
On the 6th I went with our Editor to the Zoological
Gardens, and left instructions for the Ouzels to be supplied with
worms as frequently as possible during my absence: but un-
fortunately the man who cleans out my cages and aviaries, was
unable to attend to them so regular!}&apos; as I could do when at
home; to which fact I attribute a serious disaster.

On the 7th when I first supplied food, I only heard one
rather feeble voice from the nest; and later in the day when I
threw some worms into the aviary, the cock bird swallowed them
instead of breaking them up and taking them to the young ; I
therefore concluded that matters had gone wrong, and got a pair
of steps to enable me to examine the nest. Still, the fact that
both birds flew at me in fury, loudly chack-chacking the while,
led me to hope that my fears might not be realized.
When I touched the young none of them moved; I lifted
out the nearest bird and found it dead but plump and pink,
showing no discoloration ; as I put my hand on the second it
gave a scream and sprang out of the nest, and I was only just in
time to save it an ugly fall: its father was in such a rage that he
flew straight at my face, buffeting me with his wings ; the third
bird was evidently dead, or it would have been sure to leap out
when its brother did so : I replaced him in the nest and came
away.
Examining the young bird which I had removed, I con-
cluded that it was about eight days old, the feather of the flights
just emerging from the sheaths, and only the centre of the
abdomen being still uncovered : in appearance it much resembled
a young Blackbird at this age, excepting that the bill was
noticeably longer. The living youngster, which was rather
larger than the two others, and therefore probably a cock, would
not remain in the nest after its scare ; and in the evening I found
it on the bottom ledge in a corner of the aviary. I tried to-
persuade it to settle down in a sieve filled with hay, but it would
not remain there, but flopped away to the other end of the aviary
and, as it screamed and brought both of its parents about my
ears every time I picked it up, I soon desisted. By some means
the parents managed to get it up into a tree before night, and by
the 9th it spent much of its time on a branch.
At the age of ten days (as I believe) the young bird was
distinctly browner, less inclined to be dusky on the back than a
young cock of Merula merula at the same age; in fact a young
lady who saw it declared that it was "exactly like a young
thrush," but it is possible that she may not have been familiar
with the nestling plumage of the Blackbird.

On the twelfth day I saw it fly a distance of twenty feet,
\0x25A0showing that it was fairly vigorous ; yet the cock did not feed it
so frequently as on previous days, but himself swallowed most of
the worms with which I supplied him.
On the thirteenth day I was able to get close enough to
note the colouring of the young bird:--General plumage mouse
brown, slightly more buff on sides and front of neck, and with a
\0x25A0distinct buff spot on centre of throat; the throat and breast with
short blackish streaks: bill brownisli-flesh, huffish at tip; the
wax-like swollen margin of the gape narrow and sulphur yellow;
feet clear flesh-pink : a little of the loose nest-down still remained
\0x25A0on the crown and at centre of back ; the tail still quite short,
barely an inch long.
On the fourteenth day the youngster could fly nearly as
strongly as his parents, but was so shy that it was almost im-
possible to get a glimpse of it ; the cock only fed it at long
intervals, probably concluding that it was almost old enough to
cater for itself, I was not however able to see that it made any
attempt to do so.
O11 the fifteenth day I was unable to see a trace of the
bird, nor would the cock carry any food to it when I was near,
but made a great show of breaking up worms, flying with them
to a ledge and there swallowing them. Late in the afternoon I
&amp;quot;began to doubt whether the nestling could be alive, and therefore
I went round the aviary, looking under ferns and into corners,
but finding nothing : both parents abused me freely all the time,
so I came out: just then I caught sight of the young bird for a
minute on a branch against a background of dead sticks so like
it in colouring that most persons would have failed to see it: it
was as well concealed as a Red-uuderwing moth at rest on the *
rough lichen-covered bark of a tree, hidden to the eyes of all but
an entomologist or a hungry insectivorous bird.
As it will perhaps take another week or two before the
young bird will be entirely independent of its father, I think it
better to close these notes for the present. After the moult it
may be interesting to briefly describe the bird in adult plumage.

By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I fear some apology is needed for the appearance of these
meagre notes. In the first place, at the time they were taken down
I did not know of the existence of our Societ}^ and I never
thought that they would appear in print, and in a hurried rush
from place to place (I was only away for some six or seven
weeks altogether) with sight-seeing as the primary object, one
has little time to watch the birds, and it is only the com-
monest and most conspicuous which come under one's notice ;
it is also very difficult to determine the species from the hurried
glance which is all one is often able to get. Also this is now
quite ancient history, as it is over eight years since this little trip
was undertaken in the early spring of 1S97. I will endeavour to
mention all the chief birds that came under my notice in the
order they were met with.
We left England Feb. iSth and were to join our boat at
Marseilles. The journey across France was mostly accomplished
in the night. As one would expect, birds were few and far
between. I only noticed a small flock of Rooks ( Corvus frugilegus),
a solitary Magpie ( Pica pica), and a flock of small birds. I11 S.
France the sombre grey of the olive trees was relieved by the
beautiful pink of the almond and the white of the plum, pear, or
cherr} r trees which were in full bloom.
Feb. 20th, 7.30 a.m., Corsica was in sight, the coast is very
rocky and the higher mountains were capped with snow. When
we landed at Ajaccio one was struck with the thorough contrast
from England which we had left only two days before still in the
depth of winter, here we were suddenly transported to a semi-
tropical region. A stately avenue of date palms leads up to the
town; acacia, orange, and citron trees border the principal
streets, in the country round aloes and prickly pears grow in
great abundance. The spring flowers were much in evidence,
among which I noticed a very pretty small bluish crocus and a
kind of wild arum, the steep rocky ground near the sea was
covered with many low plants with a very grey looking foliage.
I did not see many wild birds, but Goldfinches (Carduelis carduelis),

Mr. T. H. Newman,
Chaffinches (Fringilla c-celebs), and Blackbirds (.Merida merula)
were favourite cage birds. There were numbers of Pigeons flying
about the town of Ajaccio, all very tame.
Feb. 22nd was spent at Naples (one of the few wet days).
The top of Vesuvius was hidden by misty clouds. I have no
bird notes from here. On the next morning we passed through
the Straits of Messina, getting a good view of snow-covered
Ftna.
The following morning found us anchored in the Bay of
Katokolo, from which place we took train to the famous ruins of
Olympia, passing on the way fields of the low vines which
produce the " currants" of commerce. It is said that the natives
cannot imagine what we use these indigestible delicacies for, but
suppose we make a dye from them. The usual aloe, olive, and
orange trees grow in great abundance ; birds were plentiful, but
I was unable to make many identifications, though the unmis-
takable Magpie was common ; it was about as hot as an average
English summer's day. Eizards, frogs, and butterflies were
numerous. I caught a fine locust.
It was w 7 heu we were somewhere in this neighbourhood,
though I have omitted to record the exact locality, that a Red-
breasted Flycatcher (.Muscicapa fiarva) came 011 board, and was
caught by a cat, it was then taken by Canon Tristram (who was
among our party), and converted into a "specimen." I did not
actually see this bird, but the Canon told me about it. I suppose
it was on migration, as Howard Saunders remarks that it is "only
a migrant to Italy, the islands of the Mediterranean, Greece, and
Black Sea region."
Feb. 26th and 27th were spent seeing the wonders of
Athens with its wealth of memories ; the weather was very
warm, there had not been any rain for months. The graceful
pepper trees gave a grateful shade in some of the streets, Gold-
finches and Blackbirds were the popular cage birds. Great
activity prevailed in the Piraeus, troops were being embarked for
Crete, preparations for the Greco-Turkish war being at that time
in progress. On the afternoon of the 28th we arrived at the
entrance to the Dardanelles, giving us our first sight of Asia,
which was not very imposing, as the land on that side is low

and flat, 011 the European side it is higher. As we sailed along
what might have been a river (it was so narrow), and afterwards
in the Sea of Marmora, numerous flocks of those "wandering
Jews" among birds, the Levantine Shearwater {Puffinus yelko-
uamis&apos;) were seen flying hurriedly along just over the surface
of the water, but never seeming to alight, the wind driven souls
of the lost, according to the popular superstition, seeking rest
but finding none. I also noticed a " skein " of Wild Geese flying
overhead.
By the next morning we had reached Constantinople,
which to anyone unaccustomed to the East presents, from the
water, a most fascinating appearance, with its white marble
palaces, some built quite close to the water's edge, and the domes
of the numerous mosques with their innumerable minarets
rising gracefully in all directions. Many Gulls were flying
about the harbour, I was not able to identify the species, but
Sclater and Taylor who were here in September and October,.
1875, writing in Ibis, 1876, p. 61, say: " On the Bosphorus, at this
time of the year, the commonest Gulls are certainly the Yellow-
legged Herring Gull ( Larus leucopJuezis&apos;) * and the Black-
hooded L. melanocephalus. These were, in fact, the only
species noticed, except a single pair of L. puscus (the Lesser
Black-backed Gull) at the entrance to the sea of Marmora." So
that probably they were referable to one or other of these
species. The Common Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) was very
numerous and tame. I watched one bird for some time which
was swimming about and diving quite close to the side of the
ship. One curious habit that I noticed here was that they used the
houses near the water as resting places, sitting in rows along the
cornices, they were in breeding plumage, the white flanks being
very conspicuous. The Hooded Crow (Corvus comix ) was the
most noticeable wild land bird, it being very common, especially
in the neighbourhood of the beautifully kept cemetery at
Scutari on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus. I am sorry that I
did not notice any of the Collared Turtle-dove ( Turtur douraca)
which was first recorded from here in April, 1864, and is said to
swarm in the autumn. Domestic Pigeons were flying about in
L. cachinnans. Blit. Mus. Cat,, XXV. p. 266.

Mr. T. H. Newman,
hundreds, they were either Blues or Dark Checkers, I regret that
I did not put down the colour of the croup whether white or blue,
but this is by no means an unfailing index by which to tell from
what wild ancestor the domestic form has been derived, for no
one I suppose will dispute that our Eondon Pigeons are derived
from Columba livia , yet the white croup is by no means in the
majority, nor even is the blue colour very prevalent. One word
about the world-renowned dogs, they are almost like small
wolves in appearance, are mostly of a brownish yellow colour,
though some are black and others pied. They lie about by
day in the most crowded streets expecting every one to get out
of their way and the small puppies play among the traffic, by
night they roam the streets of their particular district, making
them quite hideous with their howls and disputes.
On March 5th we reached Smyrna, a one-horse tram took
us to the railway station, whence we started for Ephesus. The
train runs along a picturesque valley, the mountains rising 011
cither side ; we passed some swampy pools where a number of
Coots (.Fulica atra) were disporting themselves. O11 arriving at
Ephesus the attention is at once taken by the ruins of the
splendid Roman aqueduct, built by Justinian : its pillars are
40 feet high built of marble blocks from ancient monuments, the
brick vaults between them in many cases have fallen away, thus
leaving isolated pillars which are crowned with magnificent nests
of the White Stork (Ciconia ciconia). Unfortunately we were
just too early to see the birds themselves. The only one we
actually saw was on March 22nd, between Jerusalem and Jaffa,
where it was observed quietly feeding on the ground, but as I
was in a train at the time there was not much opportunity for
making a prolonged acquaintance.
While waiting for our train at Ephesus station I was
interested in watching a pair of very pretty little Eesser Kestrel
{Tinmmciilus cenchris). They were very tame and allowed me to
get within a short distance of them ; they seemed quite playful,
as every now and then they indulged in a short flight round the
building, returning to settle on the roof or telegraph wires ;
they were evidently a true pair, as the bars on the tail of the
female could be plainly seen. The wild flowers here were very

numerous, the asphodel and the crimson anemone (the Idly of
the Field) making a brave show.
March 6tli was spent at sea passing down the Archipelago,
Patmos being clearly visible among the numerous islands. On
the next day Cyprus was the only land seen some 25 miles
distant.
The following morning we arrived at Beyrout, which pre-
sented a very pretty appearance with its red-roofed houses and
tall palm trees, with the snow-covered Mountains of Lebanon
towering in the background all bathed in bright sunshine.
From here the wonderful engineering feat of a railway over the
Lebanon range to Damascus has been accomplished now some
nine or ten years; as you go up and up you get most magnificent
views, now of some towering crag, now a beautiful peep at the
sea with Beyrout far below opens out, then Mount Hermon is
seen standing out sharply defined in the clear air, as one rises to
&apos;6,700 feet above sea-level before reaching El Muallalcali, the
station for Baalbec, it can well be imagined that it gets very
cold and one finds oneself surrounded by ice and snow. It was
at about this height that I noticed many Eagles perched on the
rocks or flying about. Eagles are very numerous in the Lebanon
Mountains, six species at least may be commonly met with.
Probably most of those which I saw were Golden Eagles (. Aquila
chrysaetus ) though some of them may have been immature
Imperials ( A . heliaca), as Canon Tristram so long ago as 1865
remarked on the extraordinary abundance of this species in this
region ; anyway I did not notice the white scapulars which are
-so conspicuous an ornament in the adult bird.
A drive along the beautiful valley of the Lebanon with the
-snow-clad heights of Lebanon on the left brings one to the
famous ruins of Baalbec. I saw some Hawks perched on the
lofty summit of one of the six remaining columns of the Temple
of the Sun, also some Swallows or Swifts, I am not sure which
--this will show the difference in the temperature here to that
on the pass just left.
March 14th, landed at Jaffa. I noticed many Swallows,
which were presumably referable to the dark form of Hirundo
rustica which is resident throughout the year in Palestine.

Mr. T. H. Newman,
Canon Tristram supposed them to belong to the Egyptian
Swallow (H. savignii), or, as he calls them in the " Ibis," 1867,
p. 361, H. cahirica-, which is distinguished from the common
Chimney Swallow by its deep chestnut under-surface, but Sharpe
and Wyatt, in their Monograph of the Swallows, state their
belief that H. savignii is confined to Egypt. The darker tinted
non-migratory bird may well, however, constitute the Palestine
Swallow as a sub-species of H. rustica.
Eater on, at the end of March, the fine Red-rumped
Swallow (H. rufula ) becomes very abundant all over the country.
Tristram remarks that ''it is a very beautiful bird on the wing,
showing its chestnut collar and wings to great advantage as-
it turns continually, flying much slower than the Common
Swallow," from which it can at once be distinguished by its
white upper tail-coverts.
On March 18th, while walking round the Pools of Solomon
(which are three reservoirs situated some little distance beyond
Bethlehem and were constructed to supply Jerusalem with water,
and two of which are still in use and partly filled) a couple
of Martins darted out from under an overgrown bank and flew
rapidly backwards and forwards several times just over the
surface of the water ; from their small size and brown-and-white
plumage they seemed to be the Pale Rock-Martin (Cotile obsoleta)
which is supposed in Palestine to be confined to the Dead Sea
Basin, which is however only some ten miles distant from this
spot, but they may have been the better known and larger Rock-
Martin (C. rupestris) of Southern Europe, which is widely dis-
tributed in all the glens of Palestine throughout the year ; our
Sand Martin (C. riparia ) does not make its appearance in the
Holy Laud until the end of March.
Vultures, both Griffon (Gyps Julviis) and Egyptian (Neo-
phron percnopterus&apos;) are very common in Palestine, though I did
not find the former quite such a conspicuous object as Canon
Tristram did 40 years ago ; the Neophron was mostly in the brown
immature phase, but I saw some that were adult; quite a flock
of them together with a few of the nobler Griffons were always
to be seen near the slaughter house outside the walls of
Jerusalem. I confess that I have a weak spot for Vultures in

spite of their unsavoury habits, they look very fine on the wing
and a Griffon is distinguished looking anywhere. I found the
large Raptores strangely fascinating to watch when at large, in
England one marks with red ink the day on which anything
bigger than a Kestrel is seen.
March 21st, a pair of Kites swooped down quite close to
me ; from their dark colour I do not think they were Milvus
ictinus, which is the common species in winter, but no sooner
does the Common Kite retire in the spring than its place is taken
by the Black Kite {M. migrans&apos;) to which species the pair I saw
very likely belonged. The Raven ( Corvus corax) was much in
evidence on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, it did not
seem very wild as I saw several quite close---it is rather interest-
ing to note that some were seen in the near neighbourhood of
the traditional site of the cave where Elijah was fed by these
birds. I saw Hoopoes ( Upupa epops ) at Jericho; I do not think
these birds are so conspicuous as their striking plumage would
lead one to suppose, of course in flight the banded wings and
tail show up clearly, but on alighting at a little distance the
bird is not so easy to see as one would imagine, the black and
white stripes merging together somewhat as in the Zebra, which
becomes practically invisible at a comparatively short distance.
On the same day that I saw the Kites I noticed a flock of
Swifts, ( Cypselus apus) I believe, as this species arrives about this
date; the large Alpine Swift (C. melba ) is also a local summer
migrant, but the little Martin-like (C. afjfinis ) is a permanent
resident.
It is rather strange that I did not notice either the Roller
or Bee-eater which should have been by this time arriving in
flocks, such brightly coloured birds should have obtruded them-
selves to the least observant.
But the bird which perhaps interested me most in
Jerusalem was the Senegal Turtle Dove ( Turtur senegalensis). This
little Dove swarmed everywhere, being quite tame, flying about
the houses and open spaces just as the Wood-Pigeon does in
Eondon, I did not actually see any nests, but from the way they
were flying in and out of holes in the walls it seemed as if they
muse be nesting there, certainly a curious site for a Turtle-Dove

to breed in, but trees are very scarce within the walls. I
watched some for a considerable time flying about the huge
stones at the Jews' wailing place, they are sometimes kept in
cages as I noticed a few with some Barbary Doves, there may
also have been hybrids between the two, as I have put down
" seemed to breed with the Barbary Turtle." T. turtur and T.
douraca also occur in Jerusalem.
I observed that widely distributed Insect the Humming-
bird Hawk-motli near Bethlehem. The wild flowers such as the
crimson anemone and cyclamen were very pretty, the former in
some places making the ground appear quite red.
March 27th found us at Alexandria, en route for Cairo.
Birds seemed numerous, for I noticed many Hoopoes, Kites, and
Vultures, besides flocks of the Buff-backed Heron ( Bubulcus
lucidus) especially in the vicinity of cattle, they were all in the
pure white winter plumage, the ornamental buff plumes not
having yet been assumed, though they are said to be developed
in the beginning of April. These birds are palmed off on the
credulous traveller as " Sacred Ibises," a bird of course with
which they have nothing whatever to do, Ibis cethiopica at all
events at the present time being very rare in Egypt, though Mr.
E. C. Taylor saw a genuine Sacred Ibis which had been killed in
Tower Egypt as recently as 1877 (" Ibis," 1S78, p. 372).
Cairo swarms with Hooded Crows and Kites, the latter
was quite the most conspicuous bird, at any time dozens could
be seen gracefully gliding in circles overhead or perched on some
elevated situation. I believe the commonest species is the
Egyptian Kite ( Milvrts cegyptius ) which is distinguished by the
adult having the bill and cere yellow; some writers have stated
that the Black Kite (d/. migrans) (which is the commoner bird
above Cairo according to Mr. S. S. Allen) is the most numerous
species in that city, but as Gurney pointed out in "Ibis," 1879,
the yellow bill of the Egyptian Kite is assumed gradually,
frequently the adult plumage being attained before this has been
acquired, and it is possible that birds in this phase may have
been taken for Black Kites.
The Senegal Turtle-Dove is also very Common, I noticed
many flying about, it is so tame that it nests sometimes even

inside a room. As long ago as 1790 Latham bestowed on this-
bird the name cegyptiacus, the Egyptian and North African
Senegal Turtle differs from the typical form from Senegal by its
large size, by the paler brown of the back and upper surface of
the tail as well as by the larger and fewer black marks on the
front of the neck. A third form has lately been described by
Erlanger from Arabia, Abyssinia, and Somaliland, it is smaller
than the Egyptian bird, hardly larger than the Senegal Dove, it
is much paler throughout and the rump and upper surface of the
tail are distinctly grey in tone and there are very few black
marks on the neck.

though then they were not so famous as they have since become.
This brings my few notes to an end, I cannot do better
than advise any of our Members to make a similar trip if they
want to see many of our rarer birds in plenty, as well as others
which do not occur here, not to mention the many other interest-
ing things which will reward them for their trouble.
THE LESSER REDPOLL IN BERKSHIRE.
By Major F. W. Proctor, M.B.O.U.
It is with much pleasure that I am able to report that the
Lesser Redpoll (Linota rujescens&apos;) is quite common as a breeding
species this year (1905) in Berkshire; and from the reports of
friends living in the Southern Counties, who have both seen the
birds and found nests, it appears to be resident in several--
notably Surrey, Essex, and Oxfordshire. During ten years
residence at Maidenhead, I have only once previously found it
breeding in this county : this was in May 1897 on Maidenhead
thicket, where the nest was built in a furze bush about four feet
from the ground. I also found the birds nesting at Byfleet, in
Surrey, close to the Berkshire border, the previous year.
This year the birds in various districts in this county are
plentiful. In one willow or rod bed I know of a colony of six

pairs, and in another four or five ; the nests being situated quite
close to each other, near the tops of the rods, in a fork, eight or
ten feet from the ground ; and, when in this situation, are always
lined, and in many cases very largely composed of the vegetable
down of the willow, beautifully neat compact little structures ;
often a few hairs and feathers supplement the lining. As a rule
the nests are not far from water, but this is not always the case,
as I have found it twice this year on Maidenhead thicket--once
in a hawthorn, and once in a furze bush, three feet from the
ground--the nearest water being quite a mile off. They are also
breeding in some of the nursery gardens near here, where I have
frequently seen and heard the birds. The number of eggs
varies from six to three, but I have only once found six, five or
four being the usual number. It is a very tame and engaging
bird, and even when you approach its nest sits on still, and if
frightened off only goes a short distance away.
Undoubtedly this is a Redpoll year in the Southern
Counties, and it will be of interest to know if any of your
correspondents living in the South have observed the birds in
their neighbourhoods.
iS is is iS iS
Since writing the above I have discovered more Redpolls'
nests, and at the present moment three broods are hatched or
are hatching out in a place where they are not likely to be
disturbed, from its being very inaccessible. These may be
second broods, as the birds undoubtedly have two, and Mr.
Howard Saunders states in his Manual, I believe, that the
young have been found in the nest as late as September.

The arrival at the Zoological Gardens of no less than
eleven living examples of the curious flightless Kiwi of New
Zealand is a very important and interesting event, and in all
probability this is the largest number ever received at one time
by any public institution in Europe.
The Kiwi was first described by Shaw in 1813 from a
specimen obtained by Captain Barclay on the Southern Coasts of

being still preserved in the Liverpool Museum.
There are four species recognised as distinct at the present
time, namely A. australis a reddish brown bird, from the South
Island, described by Shaw in 1813 ; A. oweni , also of the South
Island, much greyer than the others, described by Gould in

1847 ; A. mantelli a blackish bird inhabiting the North Island,
described by Bartlett in 1850 ; and A. haasti of the mountain
ranges of the South Island, described by Potts in 1871.
The Apteriges are generally admitted to be related to the
RatitcB or Strutliious birds, though they differ very markedly in
several ways from these, perhaps the most notable feature which
separates them from all other birds is the position of the nostrils
which are situated at almost the extremity of the bill.
Sir Walter Buller has given a long account of these birds
in his Birds of Neiv Zeala?id (2nd ed. II., p. 313), and Rowley
has also gone into the subject thoroughly in his Orinithological
Miscellajiy (Vol. I. p. 2), but the most up-to-date paper is that by
the Hon. Walter Rothschild in the Novitates Zoologicce for 1899,
pp. 361--386, and the following extract will be read with interest.
He writes:--" The Kiwis are very swift runners, and can make
very good use of their extremely powerful legs. They are
always ready to kick at any object ayproaching them closely. In
kicking they strike forward like an Emu or an Ostrich, but I

have seen an Apteryx ajtstralis from Stewart Island frequently
kick backwards as well as forwards. The blow from a Kiwi's
foot is strong enough to rip open a dog's leg, and will cut a man's
hand to the bone. As is well known, they are nocturnal in
habits, but at Tring several North Island Apteryx frequently
came out of their shed and basked in the sun. The cries of this
Kiwi could be heard nearly all over the little town of Tring,
when I had dozens of them alive in a paddock near the
Museum. They seem to cry when it pleases them, but by no
means more than usual on dark and wet nights ; on the contrary,
I think, most on clear, moonlight nights. They cry chiefly
between eight and twelve, and are apparently silent for the rest
of the night, but in winter they can be heard from about six to
ten o'clock and later. The cry of the male is a somewhat
hoarse, shrill whistle, often distinctly like Ki-i-wi, often shorter,
more in one syllable. The female answers in a less loud, harsher
and shorter, more screaming note. Sometimes, but rarely, a low
cackling or grunting note is heard, probably of both male and
female. When angry they hiss audibly, and when feeding make
a sniffling noise with their nostrils, evidently to clear them from
extraneous matter.
" Their natural food is entirely worms, but occasionally
they are said to swallow seeds and fruits. I have had many
alive, some now in the ninth or tenth year. They delight in
earthworms, but live excellently on raw meat, chopped up in
small pieces, boiled potatoes and soaked bread. In this climate
it is best to allow them a free run in the open, on soft ground,
where they can probe for worms, and they must, of course, have
a low, dark, but dry, little room under ground, or made of a box.
This hiding place must be well covered, to keep warm in winter
and cool in summer, while artificial heat is quite unnecessary,
except in--for England--exceptionally cold winters.
" They are nearly all, but more so the larger species, of a
very pugnacious disposition."
Very little is known of the nesting habits of Kiwis ; in all
probability one egg only is laid to a clutch, though it has been
stated that two or three have been found together. The incu-
bation period is also quite unknown. At the Zoological Gardens,

in years gone by, Kiwis have occasionally laid eggs, and it lias-
been ascertained that the male, the smaller bird, undertakes the
duties of incubation. No young bird has ever been hatched in
Europe, so far as we are aware.
It is sincerely to be hoped that the specimens now at the
Zoological Gardens may do well, and that in time they will breed,
and so settle many points connected with the natural history of
this extraordinary creature, which, there is reason to fear, is
doomed to extinction before very long, thanks to the introduction
into New Zealand of innumerable cats, stoats, ferrets, and other
obnoxious vermin. D. S.-S.
THE PEKIN ROBIN IN LONDON.
Those members who, like myself, are interested in avicul-
ture in the open, will be glad to hear that the Pekin Robins I
turned out this year appear to be still doing well in the London
parks.
The fact of the liberation of the birds was announced in
the press at the time of release of the first batch, in St. Janies'
Park before Easter. In all I turned out here about thirty speci-
mens : and a little later, in Regent's Park, about fifteen. Of
these latter half-a-dozen were very kindly contributed by Mr.
J. D. Harulyn, before his departure for West Africa.
From time to time I have heard news of the birds, and this
was never unfavourable, as none seem to have come to grief; a
day or two before writing this (July 15th) the bird-keeper at St.
James' Park told me he had just seen one near his house, and a
little before a pair in Hyde Park. In all probability they have
bred in various places by this time.
I have heard that His Grace the Duke of Bedford has had
these birds loose on the estate at Woburn Abbey for about two-
years ; perhaps Her Grace the Duchess, as one of our members,,
would be kind enough to let us know how they have got on
there.
In conclusion, may I ask any of our members who may
have a Pekin Robin which is not wanted, to liberate it in one of
the parks in London, now that a nucleus has been established for

a colony of this charming species. A bird which has been in
an outdoor aviary could be liberated at any time of the year, as
the Sparrow would show it where to find food. This, I may say,
I have seen a Pekin Robin steal from a Sparrow ! --and my heart
warmed tenfold to Liothrix luteus in consequence.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
CRIMSON-WINGED PARRAKEETS, &amp;c.
Sir, --My Crimson-winged Parrakeets sat on three fertile eggs in a
\0x25A0small tnb, after laying one batch of clear eggs on the ground, (these I put
under a pigeon and so found out they were clear). I was going away the
day they were hatched, and seeing them rather disturbed by a cat that
walked near, I went and looked in the tub which was on the ground, and
found that in coming out of the tub, the hen must have dragged two young
ones away from the end, because I found them cold but still squeaking.
They had food in their crops, and I took them indoors and revived them,
and put them back with the other egg, which I hear hatched out next day.
Once or twice the man who looks after them in my absence found them
away from the corner, and he put them back. I think the Parrakeets must
have hatched on Tuesday, June 20th, and one died on Friday, and the other
\0x25A0on Saturday. They looked after the young one well till July 4th, then
they fed it very little, and to-day, July 6th, it is getting very thin, though I
Rave hand-fed it. The hen never sits on it now in the day time, and it has
no feathers. . I am writing this letter in the hope that a breeder of the
Crimson-wings will give me his or her experience, food, etc. Mine have
strawberries, grapes, sunflower, crushed hemp, canary, millet, rape, sponge
\0x25A0cake, biscuit, Quaker oats and green food. They are in quite a small
aviary with three Goldfinch mule hens. I am going to try them with fresh
ants' cocoons.
I have reared two Virginian Cardinals, a pair I think, but the hen has
broken its leg. The old pair have two more young ones in the nest.
I have also reared Desert Trumpeter Bullfinches.
I should like to know how to find out an egg eater in an aviary.

Sir, --In the June number of Bird Notes, (Vol. IV., p. 102) Dr.
W. G. Creswell says, "Java Sparrows have been bred in cages from time
immemorial in China and Japan. Mr. Finn himself and Mr. Heselton both
tell me the inhabitants of these countries never by any chance use egg food
for their birds." In Vol. II., p. 224, he says, " Mr. Frank Finn tells me that
the Chinese, who, as he says, know practically all that there is to be known
respecting the keeping of cage birds, never give egg even to insectivorous-
birds."
I wish to state that I have never said that the Chinese never give egg
to birds, nor have I ever said that they know practically all that there is to-
be known respecting the keeping of cage-birds; nor have I made any
statement whatever about the methods of feeding employed by the
Japanese. I wish, by the way, some one would tell us about these.
I11 the June number, also, on p. 195, Mr. H. R. Fillmer says I have
" apparently mixed up Urolo 7 icha acuticauda with U. striata, for U.
acuticauda can scarcely be called ' dark brown,' while U. striata is properly
so described." I have not made any mistake here; both species are chiefly
dark brown above, but beneath U. striata shows a solid black breast and
pure white abdomen, while U. acziticauda has a dark brown breast with
lighter edges, and the abdomen pencilled with pale brown at the sides at
all events--all over in those I have seen. It thus gives a general impression
of a brown colouration, whereas the other, roughly speaking, looks black
and white at a little distance. Frank Finn.
AN UNCOMMON PARROT ( Geojfroyus cyanicollis).
Sir, --I procured the Parrot of which I enclose a coloured drawing
from the Celebes about two months ago. Our Museum books have na
record of this bird, neither have they the skin of one in their collection.
It is the first of its kind to come here, and any member giving its correct
name would greatly oblige. Perhaps The Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton
may be able to give some information.
The bird is a great pet being very tame, and except for a call has no
particular whistle and does not talk. Some of my friends tell me it is
probably the Slaty-headed Parrakeet ( Palceornis schisticeps ) from the

Himalayas, but as I got the bird from the Celebes I have my doubts as to
this identification.
The drawing I am sending gives the true colours of the bird, and I
hope to get some information from the numerous members, if such a bird
has ever been exported to England.
David Ezra.
Calcutta , June 7th, 1905.
[The drawing represents a female of Geojfroyus cyanicollis from the
TMolucca Islands. We are not aware of any living specimen having been
brought to this country. It is a handsome species, the prevailing colour
being green. The male has a bright red face, a blue collar round the nape,
and red upper mandible to his bill. In the female the head is brownish
grey and the bill brownish.--E d.].
THE BROTOGERYS PARRAKEETS.
Sir,--I want very much to know whether I have a Tu&apos;i Parrakeet or
not.
Mr. Jamracli has sent me three kinds of Brotogerys. One is a Canary-
winged, B. virescens ; another (No 2) he says is Tu'ipara ; but I am not sure.
It has only a slight indication of a yellowish forehead. The flight feathers
are blue, edged with green : the tail is inclined to blue also in the central
feathers. A spot of bright orange immediately under the beak, all the
rest rich green; though 011 the crown of the head there is a faint wash of
blue over the green. And is the 3rd a Tovi? White skin round the eyes,
d.e. whiter than in No. 2 and the Canary-winged. A bright rich green,
with clear yellow under the wings at the shoulders, and the same orange
spot immediately under the bill. Brownish bronze on the wing coverts.
Beak lighter than No 2, whose whole beak inclines to brown as if stained
in coffee.
The supposed Tu&apos;i is very tame, and evidently a young bird.
I have not your book Parrakeets with me; or I would not bother the
author thereof ! ! I do not remember that the Tui&apos; has the orange spot
under the bill. Hubert D. Astuey.
\_Brotogerys tuipara is easily distinguished from B. tui by the bright
orange spot under the bill. B. tui has a conspicuous yellow forehead,
whereas in B. tuipara there is a narrow band of orange in that region. Mr.
Astley's bird (No. 2) is therefore Brotogerys tuipara, a rarer species than B.
tui. The third bird described is undoubtedly the Tovi Parrakeet, B)otogerys
jugularis. -- Ed.]

Sir,--I am much obliged to Dr. Jas. Geo. Mylan for his courteous reply
to my request " for particulars of the cases in which he has diagnosed these
diseases in birds, and the grounds for his diagnosis." He has gone
*considerably beyond this, by entering upon the subject of diphtheria, which

I did uottouch on, and also by quoting the opinions of others, which I
did not ask for.
Putting aside the question of diphtheria, which, as I have said, I did
not touch upon in my previous letter, and which is another story% there are
these two diseases, consumption and typhoid, which, in his lecture
Dr. Mylan states that birds could easily contract. And this position he
adheres to and endeavours to substantiate.
First, with regard to consumption. It is no news to me, or to
anyone who takes an intelligent interest in bird diseases, that all but the
more recent observers speak of avian tuberculosis as a common disease.
Within the last year or two, however, those bacteriologists who have made
a special study of the subject have asserted that the bacilli of the so-called
tuberculosis avium are in all cases which have come under their notice
simply the bacilli of septicaemia, and have supported their opinion with
proofs which appear to be conclusive. The circumstances under which
Dr. Mylan's own birds died are just those under which our more modern
observers almost invariably find septicaemia, and there is therefore a very
strong presumption that what he calls " avian tuberculosis " is merely what
is more correctly described as septicaemia.
With regard to typhoid fever, Dr. Mylan admits that he has had no
personal experience of it in birds, but adds the. singular remark that " Drs.
\0x25A0Greene and Butler and Wallace mention this disease in their works." I
cannot help pointing out that Dr. Greene has never claimed to be a bacteri-
ologist, for the simple reason that his medical studies were completed
before bacteriology was heard of. That Dr. Butler is a doctor of philosophy,
not of medicine. And that Wallace (assuming that R. R. Wallace is intended)
was merely a good example of the old school of Canary fanciers, and
absolutely without scientific knowledge. It is as much as if I were to quote
Blackstone, a friend of mine who is a well-known doctor of music, and the
late Mr. Joseph Abrahams, in support of an argument on the construction
of a modern statute.
And surely the readers of th &amp; Avicultural Magazine do not, at this
time of day&apos;, require convincing ''that certain very infectious forms of
\0x25A0disease exist among birds." Those aviculturists who have not already
learnt that, must either be absolute novices, or incapable of learning
anything. The question is, what are these forms of disease ?

CONSUMPTION, &amp;c., IN BIRDS.
Sir,--M r. J. G. Mylan states that he has found Tuberculosis in
Gouldians and Canaries, and that their livers and spleens were swarming
with Tubercle bacilli. He tells me in a private letter that he has known
several fatal cases of Phthisis in human subjects contracted from Canaries.

If tliis is true it is a very serious matter. Further, he quotes Nocard to
the effect that "Tuberculosis is a common disease among birds."
This being so, there can be no difficulty in demonstrating its existence
and I request him to do it. I challenge him or anybody else to produce a
cage bird suffering from Tuberculosis, that has not been deliberately
inoculated for the purpose, and to demonstrate tubercle bacilli in the spleen
and liver of that bird.
I have searched in vain for Tuberculosis in cage birds, and if they do
really suffer from it I shall be only too grateful to anyone who can show me
a case.
We can defer the similar demonstration of Typhoid and Diphtheria
till this one is finished. W. Geo. Creswerr.

The latest achievement in Ornithology
from a letter from Mr. J. PARKINSON,
NATURALIST,
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October 30/fi, igoi.
" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot
Parrots which I have reared were brought up on your Aesthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE " of Dec. 4th
Says-- " Mr. Parkinson has apparently solved the problem of
Parrot-rearing, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

THE GOLDEN-THROATED BARBET.
Cyanops franklini.
(Cat. Birds Br. Mus. XIX, p. 69).
By Reginald Phillipps.
I have been asked to write an account of this species, to
accompany the publication in our Magazine of Mr. Gronvold's
excellent water-colour drawing and clever sketches; but I find
it a difficult task, for the only specimens I have ever met with,
that probably have ever reached this country alive, were in my
possession for little more than eight months, and left my hands
as long ago as the 28th May, 1903. However, I have kept
several examples, for lengthened periods, of a kindred species,
the common Blue-cheeked Barbet, Cyanops asiatica ; and to know
the one will assist us in understanding the other.
It was on the 17th September, 1902, through the courtesy
of Mr. Ezra of Calcutta, that two Golden-throated Barbets came
into my possession. They had unfortunately been forwarded in
a too-open case, and had evidently been attended to on the
voyage by some one who did not understand birds, although he
may have been good at a camel or a rhinoceros; and the birds,
unwisely caged together, in their mad terror, had knocked them-
selves to pieces. They had not so much as a full half-inch of
tail- or flight-feather between them ; but the moult, commenced
before or during but checked by the journey, was recommenced,
with the result that No. 1, a male, soon became quite a respectable
bird, and No. 2, probably a younger male, not altogether and
entirely the other thing. For as long a lime as I could with any

Mr. R. Philupps,
countenance, I clung to the belief that the latter was a female;
whatever the sex was, it was terribly afraid of the former, a fact
which probably had something to do with the circumstance that
it suffered more during the voyage than the other, and never
seemed fully to recover from its ill effects.
The arrangement of the colours of this species is well
shown by Mr. Gronvold, but there should have been more of the
golden yellow in the region of the chin. His painting was taken
from No. 2 bird, which was placed in a small cage for the
occasion and was very nervous on being so closely scrutinised.
The position is consequently unnatural, and the loose grasp of
the perch misleading. When free it is a tight, lively, active bird
with a firm and tenacious grip of the perch, which is well
represented in the line drawings which were taken from the
other when loose in the garden.
The Museum Catalogue gives the total length of the adult
male as 8 inches, which is a trifle less than that of the Blue-
cheeked species. The latter is probably familiar to most of our
readers ; and the Golden-throat is very like it in general shape and
carriage. But the Golden-throat lacks an almost imperceptible
turn up of the nose that gives the adult male Blue-cheek a
cynical, supercilious, Laughing-Jackass-like expression which in
some examples is very taking.
My male Golden-throated Barbet had a great deal to say
for himself. I11 a manner that is so characteristic of these
Barbets, his language was remarkably forcible, but, in this
species, was not objectionable. Now and then, for a time, he
uttered the pleasing bubbling note of the Blue-cheeked Barbet,
which however was at length entirely abandoned; is this call
natural to the species or was it borrowed? I am unable to say.
His own proper call had no uncertain sound about it, and was
ceaselessly poured forth from his leathery throat with the violence
of water from a fire-hose. It was something between the go-
back of the common Guinea Fowl and the too-rook of the Senegal
Touraco, with variations, and was continued with irrepressible
obstinacy notwithstanding an occasional shower from the garden
syringe. No 2, unable to suppress himself entirely, would
occasionally attempt to have his little say, but he so promptly

brought down upon himself such a storm followed up by swift
action that he would quickly bottle up his rebellious spirit and
sulkily withdraw into his shell.
The Golden-throated Barbet is a bird of much character,
but is not imbued with a superabundance of modesty. My No. 1
gloried in flying into the garden ; and from the highest and most
conspicuous perch he would defy the feathered world to mortal
combat. The other birds found it convenient not to hear the
challenge, and passed by on the other side when he came their
way. Nevertheless he rarely actively interfered with any that I
then possessed, the Barbet excepted. That he was capable of
making himself disagreeable to unfavoured companions may be
gathered from the following extract from a letter written to me
by Mrs. Johnstone long after I had forwarded the two birds to
her:--" One of the Barbets is alive and verj^ well. I must part
with him. ..... He is a curious and interesting bird, but I had
to take him out of my Touracos' aviary as he absolutely terrorised
them. He has a very powerful beak and I think used it with
great effect." To this I must add that, with me at any rate, these
Barbets ( Cyanops) never attempted to hurt the little birds. But
they have very strong dislikes, whatever their likes may be, and
the following case I think correctly exemplifies the temper and
pertinacious character of the genus. Many years ago a male
Blue-cheeked Barbet in my garden took a dislike to a male
Tesser Hill-Mynah (h/aznatns religiosics), perhaps because the
latter was so talkative. The Barbet would follow the Mynah
round and round the aviary, in and out, here and there and
everywhere, with a ruthlessness that was almost diabolical. The
Mynah was the cleverer in dodging, and on the wing amongst the
trees and shrubs, and could escape, but the Barbet would continue
the pursuit with untiring pertinacity, keeping the Mynah con-
stantly on the move like a stoat pursuing a rabbit.
The Barbets of the genus Cyanops are thrown away when
kept in a cage ; moreover, owing to the nature of their food,
although preserving their plumage well, they are objectionable
when confined in a small place. The objections apply with of
course greater force to the keeping of the larger Barbets of the
genus Megalcema in cages or living rooms, however engaging they

may be as pets when properly managed. In a large garden
aviary they are altogether different, their bright colours and
assertive conspicuous movements, sometimes bordering on the
grotesque, making them very interesting subjects to those who
love to study the various natures and habits of different species.
Although usually so conspicuous, they can hide themselves with
remarkable success, their general green body plumage assimi-
lating well with the leafy foliage of a natural aviary.
The Barbets have a zygodactyle foot, that is, two of their
four toes point backwards. The uses to which this form of
foot is put vary greatly in different families. To take a few
examples :--111 the Woodpecker, the two hind toes aided by the
stiff tail enable the bird not only to comfortably support itself
whilst feeding and even whilst sleeping on the side of a tree--
usually or often sleeping on the inside of a hole with the head at
the aperture--but to hop about on the side of a trunk, upwards
and sideways, with ease and comfort. Amongst the Parrots,
which vary greatly in detail, the zygodactyle foot enables the
bird to take a firm grasp of a bough as it climbs about and
reaches from one bough to another, many using the beak as a
third hand, some sleeping like the Woodpecker on the side of a
trunk or hanging on the inner side of a hollow. Very differently
does our Common Cuckoo use its comparatively feeble * zygo-
dactyle foot. Its favourite food is the caterpillar ; and the value
of the species to mankind in this connection is incalculable. The
caterpillars are mostly on the leaves at the ends of branchlets ;
and the simple dancing and drooping of the branches as the
Cuckoo, balancing itself with wings and tail, clambers about at
the extremities would be constantly unseating it were it not for
the small opposing "forefinger and thumb" which enable the
bird to take a secure hold of the tiniest twig. The Touraco has
a semi-zygodactyle foot, the outer toe in life turning right
or left rather than backward, enabling its owner to run with

Mr. R. Phillipps,
up to a stand instantaneously. But it uses its double toes for
another purpose. It can take such a firm gripe of a suitably sized
branch that, when feeding on fruits, berries, leaf-buds, &amp;c., and
aided by its light but much lengthened bill, it can reach to an
astonishing distance and so secure food which otherwise would
be unobtainable. And it is in this latter capacity that the zygo-
dactyle foot renders valuable service to the Barbet, aided by the
sturdy, muscular, well-knit frame. When feeding in a tree, and
they live amongst the trees and bushes, they can reach and hang
about and feed in any position and at any angle. I have seen a
Blue-cheeked Barbet in my garden stretch himself out horizon-
tally, so fully extended that legs, body, neck and bill were as
rigid and straight and (one feels inclined to say) as thin as a
walking stick, just to obtain some coveted leaf or shoot. And a
new arrival, hesitating to go down to the lowest perch, reached
and comfortably partook of its food from the centre perch of the
cage, the entire legs and body being fully extended downwards at
an angle of some 45 degrees, and recovered its position on the
perch as easily and gracefully as a man would reach out his arm
for an apple and draw it in again. Perhaps I should add that,
although the Barbets do not climb about the trunks of trees after
the manner of the Woodpeckers, they can and do support them-
selves on the sides of trunks or branches when desiring to do
so.
These Barbets feed mainly on fruits, berries, and vegetable
matter, usually biting or splitting off with their powerful sharp
pointed and sharp edged bills just as much as they can swallow
whole, for they do not usually break or tear up their food. It is
best, therefore, to cut up the food of the captive Barbet. With
me they seemed to feed almost exclusively 011 fruits and vegetable
matter, including cut up raisins. It is said that some species will
take an occasional insect.
For foreign birds these Barbets ( Cyanops) are not delicate
if allowed plenty of liberty; but they must not be subjected to
draughts nor to too much cold; and usually they are all the
better for being kept warm. They are very easily maintained in
health and plumage, and, with ordinary care, will live for years.
The sexes in the Golden-throated Barbet are nominally

alike; but it may be that actually there are differences as in the
case of the Blue-cheeked Barbet. With the latter species, I
found that the sexes in living examples are usually distinguish-
able, the male, when adult, having a general masculine and
thicker appearance, especially about the head and bill, and it is a
bolder bird. The young male is remarkably like the female ;
and my first attempt at breeding the species was with an adult
and an immature male. Further experiences taught me that
whereas the young male, separated from but placed in the same
room with an adult bird of the same sex, will vigorously and
volubly rail at and defy him, the female is practically mute.
In the wild state these Barbets nest in holes of trees,
usually of their own making, and lay white eggs; occasionally
a little dried grass is found in the nest-hole ; when the space is
limited, the birds, young and old, cock their tails forward over
their backs like the Toucans. With a healthy pair, there should
not be any particular difficulty in getting them to breed in this
country in a suitable garden aviary. Referring again to the
Blue-cheeked species, the female I found to be a nervous bird ;
but a nervous bird in a log-nest cannot see much and thinks it
cannot be seen, and often sits very closely so long as it is 7 iot once
dishirbed. If an old unsound tree trunk were to be put up, in
which the birds could hollow their own nest-hole, the chances of
breeding would be most favourable. Repeatedly in the spring-
time I have noticed my Barbets in the garden endeavouring to
excavate hollows. Even human beings it must be remembered
usually prefer stones of their own breaking. My second attempt
at breeding Blue-cheeks proved unsuccessful owing to the nest-
ing receptacle (a very long spout of cork bark) selected by the
birds having been incautiously hung close both to the roof and
to the end of the aviary, under and near to a tree in the next
garden with branches spreading over the back. One night the
cats, aided by this tree, made an assault on the aviary, and the
female Barbet, frightened out of the spout, flew on to the side,
which at that time consisted of single (since those days it has
been double and of smaller mesh) one-inch-mesli wire netting.
In the morning I found the headless body of the poor creature
on the ground, and some seven feet above the spot there was one

mesh of the netting all too plainly marked : the cat had evidently
seized the face or bill of the bird and pulled the head off, the
body being too large to pass through--and yet there are persons
who are surprised that I am not fond of cats !

(Second Notice y.
By Dr. Albert Gunther, Hon. M. Avic. Soc.
The pair of Shrikes, whose breeding operations I had the
pleasure of reporting in the Avicultural Magazine of last year,
have bred again in the present year.
I moved them from their winter quarters into the aviary
which they occupied last summer, on April 24th ; it took some
time before they settled quietly down to their domestic life.
At one time, and for several days in May, the female chased the
male ceaselessly and mercilessly; and it was only in the middle
of the month that the parts were reversed. By the end of May
the loss of the feathers round the base of the male's beak showed
that he was engaged in building the nest. But although he had
ample materials for its construction, he merely lined with fine
grass the bottom of a basket hung in the same holly-bush which
was the homestead of the family on the former occasion. No
doubt he saved himself a great deal of trouble by this proceeding.
Oviposition was interrupted by a spell of cold rainy
weather, and in the end the clutch consisted of four eggs only ;
incubation commenced about June 10th. Two of the eggs were
hatched on the 24th, and the young left the nest on July 10th.
* The foregoing- was written some months ago. On visiting the Zoo. this last June,
I found the Barbet in the Western Aviary, looking neither in good colour nor in good
spirits.--R.P.

They seem to be stronger than last year's brood, and at the
present date (July 22nd) they are able to reach the highest perch
by flying, and to occasionally find their own food.
At this age the sexes are not distinguishable. But I may
add to my former report that the young reared in 1904 proved
to be two males and one female. They have not shown an
inclination to breed.
P.S.--The young are doing well and are now independent
of their parents.
THE BREEDING OF SONG-SPARROWS.
I am not aware of a published record of the breeding
in captivity of any species of Zonotricliia, and therefore the
rearing, in my aviary, of hybrids between two species of this
genus may be worth recording.
In the winter of 1903-4 I obtained two females of the
Chingolo or Pileated Song-Sparrow ( Z. pileata) from a dealer,
which, during the following spring and summer, built nests, laid
full clutches of eggs and sat steadily, but of course without
result. I was therefore most anxious if possible to obtain a male
of this species, but all efforts in this direction entirely failed.
In the early spring of the present year, however, I was fortunate
in obtaining the loan of a male of the White-eyebrowed Song-
Sparrow, Z. lencophrys, a handsome grey bird with the crown
striped with black and white. When this bird was first intro-
duced the two females commenced to fight between themselves
for the possession of the handsome stranger, and one was in
consequence removed to another aviary. In May a nest, com-
posed of coarse hay and lined with fine hay, was built by the
remaining female in a thick clump of sticks and rubbish, which
was fastened up some eight feet from the ground. I am told that,
in a wild state, these birds build on or close to the ground, but
apparently there was no nesting site in this position that was
quite to my bird's liking. *
* Another ground-nesting bird, a Lapland Bunting, has this year built her nest
about six feet from the ground, which simply shows how ready birds are to adapt
themselves to their surroundings.

On the Breeding of Song-Sparrows.
On or about the 26th of May one young bird was hatched.
I knew of its arrival by the energetic way the male hunted for
insects, especially small green caterpillars, of which he seemed
to find a good many amongst the shrubs growing in the aviary.
But there were not nearly enough of these to keep even one hungry
young bird alive, and I promptly supplied small gentles in sand.
These were taken as fast as I liked to give them, the parents
cramming their bills as full as they could before flying to the
nest.
The young bird left the nest on June the 7th and com-
menced to feed itself about a fortnight later.
The Chingolo repaired the old nest as soon as the young
one had left, and laid another clutch of four eggs, three of which
hatched about June the 22nd, and the young birds left the nest
on July 4th, and as I write (July 15th) are just commencing to
pick up food for themselves, though the parents will probably
continue to feed them for some time.
The young birds at present are insignificant grey birds not
unlike young Reed Buntings. The head is distinctly striped as
in both of the parents, but it is too soon to determine as to which
species they will mostly resemble.
So far as I could see the young birds were fed entirely
upon living insects while in the nest, but after they left soft
food, mostly yolk of egg, was also taken.
For the first week after leaving the nest the young Song-
Sparrows kept amongst the thickest foliage in the aviary and it
was extremely difficult to see them amongst the leaves, but every
now and then one of the old birds--usually the male--would
collect a beak-full of grubs and fly off into the shrubs, when the
voices of the young birds while being fed soon revealed their
whereabouts.

A Parrakeet Hybrid.
A PARRAKEET HYBRID.
By W. R. Fasey.
Our Editor asks for an account of the young hybrids I
have in one of my aviaries between a Pennant and Yellow-
naped Parrakeet, and knowing some of our members will be
interested I respond.
The Yellow-naped (a hen) I procured in 1901 (and I
believe it is scarce, as I have not been able to get a mate nor
have I seen or heard of any during this period) in 1903 and 1904
mated with a Barnard : several nests of young were reared ; two
of these hybrids went to our London Zoo. and one was still there
at a recent visit of mine.
The end of last year I decided to part with all odd birds,
and one of our members came over and took back with him
several, including the Yellow-naped. A week later he wrote she
was short of a toe and useless for showing, which "he had intended
it for," and would I buy it back. This I did, and but for this the
hybrids would not have been born.
She soon became friendly with a Pennant, so I decided to
try to produce hybrids instead of selling her again, thinking if
successful there would be at least a mix up of colours, and I
think I have obtained this.
About the end of May I saw they were nesting, and. later
four young ones were hatched. When they were a week or so
old I found all four out of the nest and on the floor of the
aviary,--a drop of about four feet,--and the hen evidently
attending to them there. I thought "Here is an end to the
hybrids," as the floor of the aviary was too damp, and unsuited
for rearing young parrakeets, so that they could not stop there,
and I concluded if I put them back the old ones would forsake
them, as parrakeets will not permit of interference when nesting ;
knowing this to my cost on previous occasions, when even to
look at the young in the absence of the old birds, has been
sufficient for them to desert them. However, I contended they
could not live on the floor, so they might as well die in the nest.
I put them back, and was surprised to find the old ones looking
after them in the nest as if nothing had happened. A few days
following this, one got out again and back it went, and later one

more which died. I afterwards discovered the nesting-log was
faulty in construction, the entrance - hole being on the same
level as the floor of the nest, and consequently when the young
ones began to run about a little, they could run out or perhaps
try to follow their parents ; but by careful watching I have been
able to rear three young ones, now able to care for themselves.
Most of our members probably know that a Pennant is a
showy bird : nearly all rich crimson, with blue on wings and
tail, and does not attain this colour until the second year, the
young being nearly all green until then. The Yellow-naped is a
rich dark green bird, with a black head and light j^ellow collar.
The hybrids have a black head, green wings, and yellow collar
as the Yellow-naped ; nearly everywhere else crimson, with blue
flights as the adult Pennant.
Now what I would like to know is--will they moult to a
different colour as the young Pennants do, and if so what will
that colour be ? as they already have a prepouderence of the
colours of the adult Pennant; or are they in adult plumage now?
They are exceedingly pretty and evenly marked now, and I shall
be quite satisfied if they stick to their colours.
I shall be pleased to show them to any of our members
interested.

At page 205 of this volume we reviewed Capt. Shelley's
splendid work, so far as it had then been published. Recently
the second part of Vol. IV. has appeared, dealing with the Sub-
family Ploceince, or more typical Weaver - birds, the nests of
which resemble retorts or inverted snail-shells, known to the
aviculturist chiefly in connection with the genus Hyphantornis.
It is greatly to be regretted that the most splendid of the
African Ploceince , such as the species of Malimbus and Plocei-
passer, are not familiar objects in our aviaries.
The text of this part (it is actually a volume) is quite
equal to those which preceded it; and, excepting that it takes no
account of the records of our Society, leaves nothing to be
desired: the seven coloured plates, illustrating fourteen species,
are some of the best that Grouvold has produced.

By Emily E. West.
Perhaps some of the members of our Society may be
interested in the short history I propose to send to our Editor of
the sweetest and most interesting little birds I ever had the
pleasure of keeping.
It was in the month of August, 1903, I saw 'Australian
Zosterops' advertised in a very useful weekly paper, at what
seemed to me a ridiculously low price. I sent for a pair and
they promptly arrived-- dead , to my sorrow and indignation.
They were poor miserable little bodies, nothing but skin and
bone and with hardly a feather on them ; they had no food
provided excepting white millet which was of course equivalent
to having none at all, but I fear they must have been dead when
packed. I wrote an indignant letter to the dealer and he returned
me my money, and there the matter ended for a time. Shortly
afterwards a local dealer, having heard my account of the birds,,
went up and bought a number of them and from him I procured
a very nice pair, comparatively. They were such dear confiding^
little creatures I fell in love with them, and it ended in my becom-
ing the anxious possessor of eight of them. I could not tell the
difference in sex so did not know whether I had pairs or not.
All looked dirty and draggled and most of them were in very
bad plumage, or rather I should say in want of plumage, as their
little bodies were very bare. I expected most of them would
die before many days were over, but they all improved rapidly
and wonderfully on a diet of fruit and Abrahams' food mixed
with cake or very finely ground bread-crumbs. It was a pretty
sight to see them all greedily attacking a banana, or sucking the
grapes I provided for them, and here I may note they do suck
the grapes. I sometimes fed one or two of the weaker birds
from my hand and could feel them sucking up the juice from my
fingers.
The Zosterops all seemed to like their new home--a large
flight cage--and were from the first perfectly confiding and
cheerful. Two were very weak but I kept them some months
before they died : they caught cold one very stormy night when

Miss E. E. West,
the rain poured through the roof of my bird room where there
happened to be some defect. One bird succumbed at once and
the verdict was pneumonia, the other I took into the house and
nursed up and then it died of a cancerous growth on the liver.
My six remaining pets lived and throve happily all that winter
in their big cage, and as soon as the bright summer weather came
last year I let them out in the room among a mixed collection of
Waxbills and small finches. I think I can answer for it that
they spent a most happy summer, flying about catching any
little insects they could find and tapping off the plaster from
the walls, partly I suppose for fun, for they were playful little
things, and partly no doubt in the search for live food. They
were a great delight to their owner and friends and we used
to supply them with fresh ants' eggs dug up with the ants,
and also with earwigs from the garden. Blighted fruit tree or
rose leaves also were warmly welcomed, they would clean a
leaf covered with black aphis as nicely as if it had been washed
with soap and water. I should think their 'Australian' name
of ' Blight Bird ' is most appropriate. I wish I could send 3rou
a picture of these little feathered darlings--by this time all in
magnificent feather, and as clean and bright as many plunges in
the water daily could make them--all standing on tiptoe round
a bag of sponge cake or crowding together round the same
*cherry. We used to talk of a photo for the Magazine, but I was
told that it was not possible as the room is not sufficiently
light.
As Autumn merged into Winter my troubles with these
favourite little ones began--they suddenly took to being
*disagreeable to each other for no apparent reason, and at last
five seemed to have arranged together to chase one which I
would find on the floor exhausted, so I put it in a cage, and then
\0x25A0one turned master and drove all the others about, and my efforts
to secure him always seemed to end in caging the wrong bird.
Finally I did secure him and put him in the cage with one other
as companion, leaving four free, and they got on fairly well for a
time. Then they all took to having fits, which I now think were
caused chiefly by the dried insects in the food I was then giving.
Just after Christmas one of the finest of the birds dropped
suddenl) r dead, and on the same morning they nearE all had fits.

on Zosterops going to Nest in Captivity.
I sent the dead one for examination, and the verdict was apoplexy.
I saved the others for a time by picking them np and holding
them in my hand and putting water on their heads--but soon
another one died after constant fits. Of the remaining four
I left two free and caged two.
I now fed them almost entirely on sponge cake and
Roman's Ants' Eggs damped, and of course as much fruit as
they liked to eat, but no live insects were to be obtained excepting
an occasional spider. We went on for a long time without
any more fits, but one morning one of the caged birds had a very
bad attack and, as it refused to get better, I at last put it in a very
small cage and set it out of doors, where I left it in spite of its
being a bitterly cold frosty morning. It seemed rather a desper-
ate remedy but I thought it could but die anyway. The fits
ceased but the poor little patient seemed dying of exhaustion so
I took him in my hand and carried him indoors, and after giving
him a sip of whiskey and water popped him into a silk bag where
he could not hurt himself, and after hanging up the bag left him
to die in peace.
After about an hour I went to take a sorrowful peep at
his dead body, as I expected, when out he flew quite strongly
and is now the only one of my much cherished Zosterops who
survives to tell the tale, and a very creditable specimen he is at
the present moment.
Now readers will wonder what all this has to do with the
nesting of Zosterops, but the concluding paragraph will explain.
The two little birds left free in the bird-room proved to be a pair,
and I was much interested this Spring in seeing them carrying
about little pieces of cotton from the fringe of a table cloth, and
any other little pieces they could find, but did not give them
credit for serious thoughts of a nest.
While I was away from home in May the hen gave con-
siderable anxiety by looking puffy and ill ; she got better but
took to making mysterious disappearances. She was watched,
and was found to retire to a little wire cage on the wall, in which
there happened to be a seed pan, and in this pan was found a
beautiful little pale blue egg. This w r as the second or third week
in May. On my return I gave the birds some hay to amuse

themselves with, but did not expect much work to be done. The
little Zosterops both made themselves very busy carrying it
about, and began building in the little cage, but the tragic death
of the cock put an end to my hopes. I found him on Saturday
morning, June iotli, dead on the floor, and in this case the
verdict was murder; he had been killed by a blow on the head,
either from another bird or from an accident. As all my birds,
excepting one --a very gentle Alario Finch--had been with the
Zosterops from the first, I did not, I am sorry to say, secure the
hen at once ; she looked bad, but I thought it was another egg,
and this proved to be the case. On Monday morning I found
another beautiful little blue egg on the stove guard, under the
cage where they were trying to nest. As the egg was unbroken
I suppose it could not have been thrown out; the weather was
rather cold about then, and the stove was alight, so perhaps the
bird sat on the guard for warmth. On Tuesday I had intended
giving her my house pet for a mate, but that very morning found
her too dead on the floor, and the verdict was the same--murder.
Both birds were pronounced by the naturalist who examined
them to be in perfect health and beautiful condition. I can only
suspect a pair of Bengalese, who had a nest close by, of doing
the evil deed : they never appeared to molest anything, and I had
had them a long time ; but as the Zosterops were of a very lively
and interfering nature--regular little busy-bodies indeed--it is
possible the Bengalese may have struck at them if they visited
their nest, as I believe they did. It seems probable that if these
charming little creatures could have a large aviary or room
devoted to their separate use they would nest, and possibly rear
their young, supposing plenty of small insects, blight, &amp;c., could
be provided. Personally I believe they would do well during
the Summer out of doors, and should much like to try the
experiment.
I have not described my birds, but no doubt their appear-
ance is well known to members, and the description of the
Indian variety in Dr. Butler's book (" Foreign Bird-Keeping,"
part I. p. 20) would stand for mine, excepting that the flanks in
mine incline more to chestnut than to grey.

a soft-billed bird before, I am at a loss what to give him. I have given two
parts Capern's food, one crushed biscuit, one ants' eggs, half part egg-flake,
mixed with a little water; also a few strawberries or bananas cut up small.
He is in a good-sized cage, but I am afraid one of his feet is rather
sore, though there is nothing to be seen ; he seems to sit down on the perch
a great deal. He is a very dirty bird, but I suppose that is his nature, so I
must just put up with it. He is not dull and eats well, but I should be very
\0x25A0glad if you could tell me if I am treating him properly.
E- G. B. Peddie Waddeee.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Peddie Waddell:
I have had a Mynah in perfect health for nine years: therefore, if I
dell you how I feed my bird, it ought to be a good guide As staple food I
give my usual mixture --2 parts crumb of stale household bread, 1 part
powdered mixed biscuit, 1 part 'Century Food' Grade I, 1 part preserved
yolk of egg, damped into a crumbly mixture with water. I 11 addition I
occasionally, about once a week at the outside, give half a cubic inch of
minced raw beef. I also give orange, grapes, or any other fruit which he
will accept, and a few cockroaches or other insects when obtainable. He
bathes daily. A. G. BuTEER.

SHAMAS DESERTING THEIR YOUNG.

Sir,--I should be very glad if any member can give me advice with
reference to my Shamas.
I have had the hen about four years, and she is exceedingly tame.
About six weeks ago I bought a cock freshly imported and wilder than
usual. I put him in a large cage close to the wire of the hen's aviary,
which is a small portion of an indoor conservatory wired off, and about
suitable for a pair of Canaries to breed in.
The day after the cock was brought home, the hen laid an egg from
the perch, and I put in an olive barrel which I use for all birds for nesting
purposes with some hay. The next day another egg was laid in the barrel,

which I removed. I then chanced it and put the cock in with the hen.
She attacked him with open beak but he soon asserted his authority, but
never did any harm.
About a fortnight later five eggs were laid, also in the olive barrel,
which I of course thought would be unfertile; I was much surprised
however to hear young on the 14 th day after the last egg was laid. These
birds were well fed by both parents on black beetles, mealworms, moths,
etc., but no soft food was touched. The biggest beetles were used,
apparently whole, from the commencement.
It turned out two young were hatched and three eggs were clear.
The young left the nest on the twelfth day, but the parents never fed them
again, although both carried food about in their beaks. The young were
well-feathered but could not fly. I have an idea that the person in charge
may have tried to put them back, as they appeared to have fallen out ; this
would have upset the old birds. The two young birds died on the second
day from starvation, although when I saw what was the matter I tried to
feed them, but could not make them swallow.
The parents started building the day the young left the nest, and
have now two eggs, so I want if possible to know if there is anything I can
do. Of course the place they are in, being so very small, the young were
very exposed without any shelter when they came out, and perhaps the
parents would not feed them for this reason ; although when they were in the
nest the hen would take mealworms from my fingers and go straight to the
nest with them.
The end of the barrel, which was of course the entrance, was facing
the wire, and it was easy to see right into the nest, but the hen never
seemed to mind this; and on one occasion the cock tried, when the hen
was off, to go and sit on the eggs, but she quickly turned him out. He fed
her regularly when she was sitting, but with insects only.
If this letter is interesting enough to publish you may do so; as
\0x25A0considering the cock was so wild, I think it rather surpising he should have
taken such a large share of the nesting operations in such unsuitable
quarters. Donald Swift.

Our Editor sends me the following cutting from The Field, of July
29 th, last:--"A pair of young Thrushes having been caught last summer
under some strawberry netting at Preston, near Brighton, were turned into
an aviary belonging to Mr. George .Short, of the Crown and Anchor. This
summer they made a nest in the aviary, in which three eggs were laid, one
of which has been hatched. The fact of Thrushes rearing their young in
captivity is sufficiently unusual to deserve notice.--A.R."
As a matter of fact there is nothing very startling in this fact when
we remember that a man who used to exhibit regularly in the British
Classes at the Crystal Palace, bred all his Thrushes in a cage about the size
of a rabbit-hutch. A. G. B., Ed. pro. tem.
HYBRID CONURES.
The following interesting note reached me at the end of July:--
Sir, --Would you kindly inform me whether there is anything
uncommon in a cross between the Yellow-crowned Connre and the Brown-
throated Conure. I have one of each of these birds in my aviary, and about
the middle of May found the Golden-crown sitting on four eggs in an old
box that was hanging on the wall. On the 4 th June the first bird was
hatched, and a day or two after two more. When three weeks old one fell
out of the box and was killed : the two others left the nest on the 24 th and
26 th of this month and are now flying about the aviary with their parents :
they are fine large birds with the golden front of the mother and brown
throat of the father; one has a white ring round the eyes, and the other
the same but speckled with yellow ; the rest of the plumage seems a
mixture of the various shades of green and blue of both parents.
They were brought up on the ordinary seeds in the aviary, viz.,
canary and oats, and every day a pan of fresh bread and milk was put in
the aviary. L. Sturton-Johnson.
MUSKY LORIKEETS.

purchase, as their proper treatment during my absence is somewhat
uncertain, and their character in the aviary and as long livers seems none
of the best, still they are charming.
My two pairs are apparently in the best of health, and take a
tremendous amount of exercise in spite of their clipped wings ; they are
very seldom still except at mid-day siesta time and, of course, at night :
always clambering about and playing with each other, regular romping.
They are rather noisy and very fussy, but seem to do no harm to other
birds, which, it must be owned, do not seem inclined to give them a chance,
not that ithe qtlier birds show great fear of them, but the Muskies are
always given right-of-way without having to claim it. Their especial play-
ground is a nesting box mostly covered on the outside with soft rotten
wood with a bottom of the same material, and any bird passing too close
has to run the gauntlet. Fortunately the other birds with clipped wings
can fly a little. The custom of clipping wings is most annoying. Quite
recently one pair have hunted off the other from this box, and the latter
have taken another similar box to play about with. Their choice is rather
lucky for me, as it leaves the best nesting places for other birds, who never
thought of these nests even when they were allowed to, much preferring
the more or less natural rotten wood log nests.
They are far the smartest climbers I have got, and can run at a good
pace, though when really stretching themselves on the ground, they go in
for enormous hops, very rapid but not clumsy. One curious thing about
them is their aversion to clean water, they drink a good deal certainly, but
I have not seen them bathe in it yet. Put some mud in the water, and then,
as soon as they notice it, the fun begins, and it is the funniest thing in the
aviary. First, a good long drink, then a romp in the water, rolling each
other over, and ducking each other like a pack of schoolboys with various
antics savouring of horse play. One of the favourite is to go back a little
wa}% then rush in with huge hops into the middle of the bathing pan. If
lucky enough to land on another the unfortunate is held down as long as
possible. The game is accompanied with such squawking, fortunately not
very obnoxious out of doors, and goes on for twenty minutes or so. Then
four absolutely filthy looking objects retire to a perch in the sun (if there
is any) to regain their natural brilliancy, then sometimes a short nap, and
back to their play-box. I discovered this peculiarity by accident (as usual)
after one of the dirty rain storms we get here, when there are dust storms
going on in the plains, mud also is splashed into the pans from the ground.
I thought at first that it was the rain water that pleased them, but I found
that putting in some mud had the same result; the mud may have some
softening effect as the water here is very hard. The foothold theory will
not hold good in this case, as the mud makes the bottom slimy and
slippery.

Hanging Parrakeets) they have been supplied with sop and boiled rice and
milk. Up to now they have touched neither. Fruit and green food they
eat, but not ravenously like they do Canary seed; other seeds are left alone.
They are heavy feeders as one might expect from their stout build and
active habits.
One pair especially look as if they mean business in the nesting line.
An aviculturist can't carry on without lots of hope, so I have dreams of
young Muskies in spite of clipped wings and wrong feeding; what will
most likely happen is that they will pop off into lovely corpses without
warning.
" Parrakeets" is a ripping book, small chance for a poor aviculturist
to keep the Tenth Commandment if he has this book; still I think the
Musky hardly gets his due as regards plumage, the illustration hits off my
birds for purposes of identification, which is the great thing, but the blue
on the head is the only colour approaching that of my birds in vividness,
the yellow on the sides coming least near to the live bird. The head in the
live bird is much more massive and formidable looking. Size or rather
length differs, judging from dimensions given in the book compared with
other Parrakeets and allowing for different shapes and tails especiall}&apos;, I
would swear my birds are not under io inches in length, probably a bit
more as against a little over 8 |in the book. The tail too is different in
shape and colour. In the live bird it looks a bit longer proportionately,
but this may be due to the wedge-shaped part at the end of the tail com-
mencing much nearer the base of the tail giving the idea of less breadth.
Then there is no mention of red in the tail, this would be plainly visible in
the illustration, though the tail is not much spread out, especially in the
outer feathers. The difference in length of the tail feathers from centre to
outside is much greater in the live birds, which gives the different shape.
To return to colour, the base of each tail feather is red, much duller than
the red on the head, but still fairly bright. Close to the base green appears
on the outside of both webs, increasing towards the shaft till the feather
becomes all green towards the tip. The two centre feathers have very
little red at all, and the two outside ones have very little red on the out-
side webs. When the bird is at rest no red is visible in the tail, but it is
very noticeable both from above and below (as when crawling up the wire)
when the bird is on the move.
Can my birds be not Muskies, but some nearly allied species?
Surely some one who has kept these birds would have noticed the red on
the tail, even if the other minor differences were not observed. I noticed
the red in a very short time, and at that time I had little leisure to do more
than attend to the wants of my various arrivals. My description may not
be absolutely accurate as I have not had the birds in my hand. I will send
you a "lovely corpse" if I am not away when the time comes, may it be
long in coming as these are quite the most amusing birds I have ever kept.

I fancy they would run the Hon. Canon Dutton's Blue-Bonnets close in the
way of tricks. They would make admirable cage-birds, but I prefer them
loose in the aviary, my chief fear is that they will learn to be funny at
other birds' expense after they get the use of their wings, and of course fits
are to be feared. They chatter so much that they ought to make talkers
with training, and, without incentives to tricks, they might turn their
attention to cultivating their tongues.
I send you this paper with a view to getting information for myself
and parts of it may be of interest to some members. I should be much
obliged if other members would mention if they have noticed red in the
tail.

Sir, --If the observations and researches of such eminent Bacteri-
ologists as Nocard, Villemin and Hewlett fail to convince Dr. W. G. Creswell
that Avian Tuberculosis does exist amongst birds, I am afraid that he must
excuse me from trying to do so.
And, as for your other correspondent, I am content to let him revel
in the enjoyment of his sneering remarks and the opinions of the self-
constituted experts of "Bird Notes."

P.S.--An excellent translation by&apos; Dr. H. Scurfield, (Medical Officer of
Health, Sheffield) of Professor E. Nocard's book on "Animal Tuberculosis"
is published by Balliere Tindall and Cox of London.--J.G.M.
Sir, --Up to the moment of writing Mr. J. G. Mylan has not com-
municated with me to arrange for the demonstration of tuberculosis in
birds which I have asked him for. I sincerely hope he will do so soon.
The matter is of the most pressing importance. If tuberculosis is as
common in birds as Mr. Mylan and his authorities say it is, and if Mr.
Mylan be correct in his assertion that he has traced fatal cases of consump-
tion in humans to infection from cage birds, then we as bird-keepers must
at once face the grave responsibilities we daily and hourly incur by expos-
ing helpless children and dependants to danger of which they know
nothing and cannot of themselves guard against.
If Mr. Mylan's conclusions are worthy of attention, our conduct in
keeping chamber pets which are so commonly phthisical is positively

Government.
If on the other hand this " Tuberculosis " is not tuberculosis at all,
but is only Avian Septicsemia wrongly called " Tuberculosis " by medical
men and others, who either will not or cannot investigate the matter under
modern conditions and methods, then we can continue to keep our birds
and enjoy our hobby in the full consciousness that we are not transgressing
in the matter of our duty to our neighbour.
As I said before--the matter is pressing, and I again call on Mr.
Mylan to prove his assertion. From what he himself says there should be
no difficulty in this, and I will assist him in any way I can.

ones and about 20 finches: it is 16 feet long and 5 feet wide and 7 feet high ;
about 12 feet is roofed in shed.
I thought of having Silver Pheasants, but would they&apos; hurt the other

Sir,--I n reply to your letter re Silver Pheasants: Except that they
are rather large, yon would find them very ornamental and quite innocuous
to the other inhabitants. Apart from the Californian Quail, which, as you

which our Editor has of late been telling us, but these latter two are
difficult to obtain.
There are also the various species of Rails, but from their skulking
habits they do not show off much and are sometimes apt to be dangerous
to other species.
Easily there is the great family of waders, a most entertaining group
to my mind, on which I wrote a short article in Bird Notes of December
1903, but of course they require a certain amount of soft food.
I do not think you would regret introducing some Silver Pheasants,
but in my opinion the size of the Quail would be more in keeping with the
other birds in the aviary. J. E. Bonhote.

MR. FINN AND CHINESE AVICULTURE-
Sir, --Referring to Mr. Finn's letter in your August issue:--he
considerably discounts the value of his denial of his own statement by
the tardiness with which it appears.*
I first repeated his information in the November issue, 1903, of
Bird Notes, a magazine to which Mr. Finn was then, and has been ever
since, a subscriber. In order to carry any semblance of weight his denial
should have been forthcoming directly after this first mention of his
statement, at a time, be it borne in mind, when my interview with him of
only a week or two back was too recent for its details to have been forgotten
by either of us. But instead of that his denial has been delayed for more
than eighteen months, (during which period I have more than once repeated
his statement), and even now it only seems to have been called forth by
the fact that his recent unqualified assertions as to the "need" of egg are
found to clash with the only possible inference from his former statement
with regard to the Chinese and their methods of aviculture.
What Mr. Finn said to me was that the Chinese never gave egg in
any form to any of their birds--not even the insectivorous ones; that all
they gave was dried flies and husked millet, given dry; and that what
the Chinese did not know about bird keeping was not worth knowing.
Being told shortly afterwards that Mr. Finn had never been in China,
and that in consequence his information was only hear sa}-, and being
therefore anxious to test its value, I wrote to Mr. Heselton, who had spent
a good deal of time in that and neighbouring countries, stating what Mr.
Finn had told me. He confirmed Mr. Finn in each particular save one--
that relating to dried flies. These he said he had never seen in China,
maggots being used instead. He also made special mention of the Japs.,
during the course of the correspondence.
With the same desire to be accurate, and not wishing to be guilty of
any inadvertent misrepresentation of him, I had previously written to Mr.
Finn himself on the subject.
After thus taking every conceivable precaution against error, I felt
justified in repeating Mr. Finn's statement, and I shall do so again as
occasion demands.
Under the present circumstances I also feel specially fortunate in
having taken the precautions I did. W. Geo. Cresweee.
* Mr. Finn denied Dr. Creswell's statement in The Feathered World for June 30th,
1905 : perhaps he did not contradict it at first from a desire to avoid a dispute ; but when
it was repeated, deemed it necessary to do so. When there is 110 evidence in black and
white, one man's word is allowed to be as g &gt;d as another's.--A.G.B.

<bodyText confidence="0.91500475" page_id="32656918"  page_num="348" year="" vol="">
Our Publisher sends me a little book entitled " Bird-keeping" which
he says must be at least 37 years old. At pp. 151-2 the author gives a list of
the average prices of birds as sold by Mr. Edward Hawkins, of 6 Bear
Street, Leicester Square, which I think will interest our members.

It will be seen that in those days there were no cheap foreign birds ;
nor even when I first took up aviculture were there very many : I paid
Abrahams #l for my first pair of Grey Singing-finches.
Probably in a comparatively short time it will surprise bird-owners to
discover that the Gouldian Finch when first imported by Abrahams, realized
#10 per pair and Bathilda ruficaicda #8 (a year later I gave #2 for a pair,
and now ios. per pair is an average price: it has gone lower).--A.G.B.

<bodyText confidence="0.988453780487805" page_id="32656920"  page_num="350" year="" vol="">
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Budgerigar. (Miss E. Crowfoot). [Concussion of the brain caused death].
Masked Finch. (Miss Gladstone). [No particulars of symptoms sent.
Please observe rules. Pneumonia caused death],
BUDGERIGAR. (Miss E. Crowfoot). Symptoms of diarrhoea. I gave pre-
pared chalk and Century Food, as well as canary and millet. [Your
bird died of dy&apos;sentery. You mention that some of the young are
affected whilst in the nest. If you will feed the old birds when nesting
on millet, canary, and oats, with Osborne biscuit soaked in cold water
and sqeuezed fairly dry, and flowering grass, I think you will not lose
many. I have bred the yellow variety in quantity and rarely, if ever,
lost one. The old birds feed largely on succulent green food if they
can get it, and the young birds cannot stand it. I have so repeatedly
drawn attention to this fact. Flowering grass is all the green food they
require].
Budgerigar. (Mrs. Connell). Found dead. [Concussion of the brain].
Orange-cheek Waxbiee. (Mrs. Pitt). We have lost several birds
lately. They seem to pine away and die. [Your bird died of dysentery.
Do not give any green food but flowering grass until your birds get
all right again].
Budgerigars. (Mr. Moerschell). Found dead. [Bird died of apoplexy
and was very fat. I should think probably he has been feeding too
freely on the hemp].
Two Gouedian Finches. (Mr. Dell). Seemed dull so took them
indoors and gave them weak brandy and water. [Your birds were much
emaciated and died of exhaustion].
Budgerigar and Linnet. (Miss Crowfoot). [Birds too decomposed to
examine].
Parrakeet and FRUIT-SUCKER. (Mrs. Johnstone). [Birds too decom-
posed to examine].
Pennant Parrakeet, young (Mr. Wilson). One of a nest of five*
[Your particulars are interesting but too long to report. Your bird
died of concussion of the brain. It was a male and a very fine
specimen too. Hope you will be more fortunate with others. If
they&apos; continue very wild I should partly cut one wing to avoid
injuries].

Pionopsittacus pileatus.
By Rev. Hubert D. Asteey, M.A.
I have been asked to contribute a few notes upon this
species, but few indeed they must be, for I know so little about
these birds.
Whether they are by nature tractable I cannot say, but the
male individual I possess is one of the gentlest and sweetest
tempered parrots I ever saw; but alas! a cripple!
In beautiful plumage and health, but a cripple. At some
time previous to my purchasing him he must have had his left
leg broken, somebody perhaps "took him by the left leg and
threw him downstairs," at any rate the knee-joint was not pro-
perly set, and is quite stiff although not altogether useless, for
the bird can use his foot as a prop in perching, but cannot clasp
with it. So the poor little red-cap has to spend most of his time
sitting still, which is sad.
He will allow me to take him out in my hand, and caress
or stroke him without showing any wish to pinch me.
I hold his toes when he is perching on my finger, and
wave him up and down to give him wing exercise.
He eats canary seed, rejecting the millet and hemp that is
mixed in.
He loves an "Albert" biscuit sopped in tea, which I let
him have once a day, and some fruits too he is fond of. His
voice is a very still small voice, a little minute chirruping noise
is all I have ever heard, and only then when I take him in my
hand.

Sir William Ingram,
Some people might think him a stupid bird, but bis
crippled state makes it difficult to judge of him.
Undoubtedly he is a beautiful one, and a gentler or less
noisy member of the Parrot family could not be found.
I liave'nt had him during winter-time, so I cannot say
much as to his delicacy, or contrariwise, his hardiness. He
doesn't give me the idea of being a delicate bird.
His large brown eye at once makes one think he is of a
gentle disposition.
[Tlie Pionopsittacus pileatus inhabits South-Eastern Brazil and
Paraguay, but it is very rarely brought alive to Europe. A few specimens
were imported about a year ago by Mr. F. C. Thorpe, the well-known dealer
at Hull, and a male was exhibited at the Crystal Palace Bird Show held in
October, 1904, as recorded in this Magazine for November last (p. 23). A
fine pair, from which our illustration was taken, are now at the Zoological

BREEDING GRAY'S BARE-THROATED FRANCOLIN.
Pternistes leucoscepus. %

<bodyText confidence="0.967530105263158" page_id="32656934"  page_num="352" year="" vol="">
In February of this year I purchased four pairs of Gray's
Francolins at Hamlyu's the bird dealer's. They were placed in
an outside aviary having access to a covered shed 12 feet broad
and 24 feet in length : this shed being divided into two com-
partments with a door in the partition which was left open.
In the outside aviary, which was 40 feet long, there was a
luxuriant growth of long grass and clumps of privet bushes,
just the sort of thing to tempt a Francolin to make a nest in;
but birds, like human beings, have their own ideas where to
choose a site for their nursery, and the first choice of two of the
pairs was the covered shed--one nest being made in each com-
partment. The hen that settled upon the innermost position
made her nest, or rather scraped a circular depression, amongst
* It seems very doubtful whether Pternistes leucoscepus should be regarded as a good
species, being merely a pale-coloured race of P. infuscatus. The latter species inhabits
Somaliland, but as one proceeds northwards into Abyssinia the birds become slightly paler
in colour, and these have been named P, leucoscepus by Gray; but some specimens are
intermediate between the two races, and it is difficult to say to which they should be
referred. Those lately imported have been of the pale-coloured race.-- Ed.

the straw that covered the cement floor, and was exposed to
view during the whole time of sitting. The other concealed her
" location" effectually behind some trusses of straw, and, had
it not been for the faithful attendance of her husband during
her long incubation, the nest might have been overlooked. I11
each case the dutiful " worser" half kept constant watch and
guard within a foot or two of his mate, no doubt anxiously
awaiting the arrival of his family. For twenty-three days the
incubation continued, and at last the first lady in the inner
chamber brought off seven chicks; such little mites, just like
baby partridges. On the first day, however, I picked up two of
the new arrivals lying 011 the floor apparently dead ; but seeing
there was a flutter of life in them I brought them into the
kitchen when, with the aid of warm flannel, they soon revived,
and within two hours afterwards my man placed them under the
mother bird. It was strange that so shy a being as a Francolin
should allow a brute like a human man to touch her at all, but I
suppose her maternal instincts were stronger than fear, and rather
than uncover her little ones she allowed this intrusion. The
bird had been* sitting 011 twelve eggs, the five that were left
consisting of two addled and three with young birds in them.
It is curious how different in size and shape these Francolin eggs
are: I am sending some of the "bad eggs" to the Editor.*
Thanks to the advantage of having a son who can sketch
birds with some skill, I am able to send drawings of the young
*of Bare-throated Francolins at different periods ; some of these
sketches were made from birds that were hatched under ordinary
domestic fowls; for a good many eggs in the first instance were
laid here and there on the ground. My Francolins began to lay
as early as middle of May, but the first sitting which the bird
itself incubated was not completed until July 9th. I have
hatched altogether under farmyard fowls twenty-three chicks,
and under their natural mothers seventeen chicks, so have
had plenty of opportunity to study the development of these
Francolins in their infancy.
* The egg-s are somewhat pyriform in shape and vary both in size and colour. The
average dimensions of six eggs were if and 1-5/16 inches. The surface is smocth and the
colour varies from very pale stoue-colour (almost white) to light brown.-- E)d.

took no further trouble in the matter, and left the hen to do all

At eight weeks of age the young birds showed the red
markings round the eye and their throats were bare, no feathers
having replaced the down as had been the case with the rest of
the body. At four weeks of age the back was marked with
dispersed black spots, which gave the youngster a "goatsucker"
kind of appearance, and no doubt in a wild state would greatly
facilitate its concealing itself when squatting on the ground, a
habit it early developed. The little chicks at a fortnight's age
could fly well three feet high, and from the earliest period could
run like lightning. They varied much in size, the smaller birds

being much lighter in colour, thus seemingly at an early stage
showing the variance of the two sexes.
At the time I am writing this the first brood consists of
four birds quite healthy and strong, the other three have suc-
cumbed in their infancy.
The second hen in the other compartment hatched off five
chicks from her twelve eggs, and 011 the second day took her
family into the open aviary where some Tinamous (B. rufescens&apos;)
were running, with the disastrous result that one of the little
ones was devoured and another injured by these birds ; however
the Francolin and her remaining brood were caught and placed
in a rabbit hutch, and they are now doing well in this confined
space. I,ater 011 a third " Bare-tliroat" hatched the five eggs she
had been sitting on ; the nest being in the open aviary under a
privet-tree, and she and her brood, to avoid any risk from the
Tinamous, were at once caught and placed in another rabbit-
hutch. All these are thriving, and the chicks are now (Sept. 3rd)
ten days old.
Ants' eggs, mealworms, egg and chicken food have been
their fare. The following is the result of all the hatchings of my

nestling of the Eittle Auk, M emm lus alle, and for some time
succeeded in keeping it in perfect health. Had it not been for
the ship's cat I have little doubt that it would have reached
England in safety but, despite all my precautions, this animal
found access to my cabin and, furthermore, successfully removed
the string that I had loosely tied round a box in which the bird
was placed. Having reached the young Auk I presume its
musty odour deterred the cat from killing it outright, at any rate,
when I returned to my cabin I found the little creature still alive
but so sadly mauled that it died very shortly after. When I first
procured the bird it obstinately refused to take nourishment and,
to keep it alive, I was obliged to force food down its throat; in a

few days, however, it would feed freely from my hand, taking with
avidity the raw fish and meat that I offered it. Subsequently it
learnt to recognise the human voice as being associated with its
meals and would call eagerly whenever it heard me speak. It
possessed a very curious habit of wagging its head from side to
side after every mouthful which served to give it an extremely
comical appearance : indeed, at all times it was a quaint looking
bird--a tiny round ball of black down, with a short beak and
remarkably bright, beady little eyes.
In summer the kittle Auk is almost entirely an Arctic
species, breeding in vast colonies on some of the mountains of
Spitzbergen and, according to ornithologists, also in Greenland,
Novaya Zembla, Franz-Josef Land and the extreme north of
Iceland. Although I found this bird so plentiful in Spitzbergen
I was only able to examine a few nesting-holes : as a rule the eggs
and young were so far in a crevice of the cliff that it was quite
impossible to reach them ; others, again, were situated in almost
inaccessible places or where the crumbling nature of the ground
made it extremely dangerous to climb. The mountain which I
visited during my brief sojourn in Spitzbergen was at the head
of Recherche Bay, a natural harbour much frequented in the
summer mouths by Norwegian whalers. Roughly speaking this
mountain stands about 2,000 feet above the sea level. On all
its sides thousands of Little Auks were to be found nesting,
while, in one part, there was also a small colony of Mandt's
Guillemot, Uriel mandti. Both species were breeding at an
altitude of over 1,400 feet. The Auks would be either sitting in
closely huddled rows upon the ledges of rock, or else they would
be flying round in small parties of ten to twenty or perhaps even
more, thus proving that these birds are gregarious even in the
breeding season. When on the wing they were continuously
giving vent to weird, laughing cries that suggested the call of
some Falcon--otherwise, when near to the intruder, they uttered
curious little Marmot-like noises, as though talking one to the
other. In their breeding haunts the birds are by no means shy,
and did not take alarm until I approached within a few feet of
them. When close to their nests they would come and circle
very near to my head, checking their flight by holding out their

webbed feet and taking short wing-strokes. Many of the birds
had their throats extended with, what I presume was, food for
their young, brought from the open sea. They were never
numerous in the bay r itself and the few that I observed there
were timid and easily frightened.
Most, if not all, authorities state that the Tittle Auk
lays but a single egg. Although the proportionally large size
of the eggs tends to show that this is the case, in two instances I
found the evidence to be contradictory. In the very first hole
that I examined there were tzvo eggs. Now as most of the birds
had young at the time it seems extremely improbable that these
eggs should have been laid by separate females, more especially
as they were perfectly fresh. Another nesting-hole contained
two young apparently of the same age.
To give some idea of the size of this diminutive member
of the Alcidcz family I might mention that its total length is
only 8^- inches. The accompanying sketch is of a bird in full
summer plumage.

THROATED FINCH, fSpermophila albigularisj .
By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
Ouaud on n'a pas ce qu'on aime, il faut aimer ce qu'on a ;
which being interpreted means, if you cannot get just what you
want you must put up with what you have. I felt like that
when I commenced bird keeping again last year, after an
enforced absence through illness of two years. Was it not Sir
Walter Scott who said, "Thank God for all common tilings!"
When therefore I one day saw advertised a pair of White-
tliroated Finches for sale, I wrote off for them at once. You
may ask, " Why did I not wait until the next day?" Because,
next day anything may happen. When the true sportsman sees a
trout jump within casting distance he does not wait until next
day. I never throw away a chance if I can help it, and since,
so far as I know, White-throated Finches have never yet been
bred, I said to myself, in the words of the Ancient Mariner, why
should not I be

" The first that ever burst
Into that silent sea?"
I determined, at any rate, to make a good try for it. The chance
of doing something exciting is a chance I have never the
strength of mind to resist. Only at Whitsuntide I had met with
a bitter disappointment: my Bearded Tits had gone to nest, laid,
hatched and dispatched two fine youngsters at a week old.
Witli the coming of the White-throated Finches hope
once more set her bow in the cloud. All last year they spent
their time in eating and drinking and enjoying life. Once or
twice they did fly more or less excitedly about the aviary, as
though searching for a suitable nesting-site, but it all ended in
smoke.
This year the season was well advanced before the minds
of my little friends
" Biglitly turned to thoughts of love,"
but when they did turn, there was no mistake about it. Up to
now I had always thought them a pair of quiet little unobtrusive
things, illustrating Dr. Watts' faulty natural history--"Birds in
their little nests agree." Now, however, all was changed. The
hen more especially became a perfect little fury; she simply
cleared one end of the aviary, and no other bird dared go near.
If they did, they were received with an angry rush and a sound
like that emitted by an exaggerated and very angry bumble bee.
The spot selected for the nest was, to my eye, about the
most unlikely that could have been chosen : right up against the
aviaiy south window, in the full glare of the July sun. The nest
itself is a most lovely structure, so fine and cobwebby that the
light shines through it, and yet at the same time intensely
strong. It is composed of fibrous roots, and the inside is lined
with human hair, saved from our bedrooms. To such vile uses
do we come at last! It was constructed very high up in a bush,
near the roof of the aviary. So terrible was the glare from the
sun that I felt that something must be done to protect the nest,
eggs, hen, and young when hatched, or there would be no
results, but only hard-boiled eggs. I accordingly nailed a large
bit of felt over the glass of the window, outside; a thoughtful
attention, I hope appreciated by the little hen. At any rate, it
did not disturb her in any way.

Rev. C. D. Farrar,
The nest was finished in about three days, and the eggs
deposited duly. I should like just to have taken a ' pep ' as we
say up here, but at the imminent risk of something inside giving
way first, I restrained myself, and was rewarded later on, as you
shall hear in due course.
Every morning when I entered the aviary I used to send
search lights of scrutiny around, and was always thankful to see
the little hen on her nest, with her tail in the air, and her soft
black eye fixed on me, as much as to say " All's well, we are
going to pull it off" ; and behaving as if I was of no more
interest to her than Alexander was to Diogenes. At the end of
twelve days I fancied I saw the hen slowly and cautiously lift
herself up in the nest and wriggle, as though engaged in feeding
something. I hoped hard, but still I feared it might only be my
fancy or strongly imaginative powers, especially as I never saw
the cock go near the nest. Day after day I watched closely, and
felt more and more sure that the same stealthy motions were
repeated; and after a time I was almost sure I could hear the
unmistakable sound of very young voices. Then one day I
saw the hen on the edge of the nest, and stooping down to
something within ; and then I felt sure that the eggs had
hatched, and that there were babies aboard. Now, I knew, that
my troubles would begin. It is comparatively easy to get a nest
built, a good deal more difficult to get eggs laid, harder still to
get them hatched, but hardest of all to get the babies reared.
There are so many slips between that cup and that lip ! I speak
with feeling. I had left some ants' eggs in the saucer for the
insectivorous birds, and one day I caught Mrs. White-throat
on the saucer, busily stowing away eggs. Her mouth was full,
away she flew to the nest, and I heard cpiite plainly the sound of
youthful voices 'asking for more.' Clearly White - throated
Finches, like Nonpareils and Indigo-birds, are insectivorous as
far as rearing their young is concerned. I knew from past
experience what that meant, and prepared myself for ' the easy
grace that makes a joke of toil.' I realized that for a few weeks
I should require no more exercise than they could give me. The
worst of it was that being late in the season, and very wet, the
ants, those uncanny beasts, had almost ceased to lay. I wrote

off post haste to my friend Mr. Watson, and besought him, as he
loved me, to offer his calves a willing sacrifice on the nearest
ant heap. He gallantly rose to my request and though, as he
said, eggs was werry scarce, he would do what he could to help
me. I feel now to Mr. Watson like the native of India, who,
wanting to thank a friend for some favour, said " If I were to
make shoes of my skin for your Excellency in exchange for these
favours, I would think that I had not trespassed the limits of my
gratitude " ! I felt at the same time that, as eggs were so scarce,
the most rigid economy must be prescribed--not a very easy
matter in a large mixed aviary. Imagine then my feelings, when
next I replenished the saucer, to see a lieu Yellow Sparrow hop
down and begin her unholy labours on my tiny store! I became
at once a primitive man, with passions bloodthirsty and elemen-
tal. There was something in the cool outrageous way she settled
on the dish offensive in the last degree ; and when at last after,
I fear, she could eat 110 more, I drove her away, she merely
settled down on a neighbouring bush and used language towards
me which, as James Yellowplush used to say, " I would not
demean myself by repeating."
After some days I noticed that the cock began to visit the
nest, and soon his journeys were well nigh incessant. Every
few minutes he would be popping in and out of the nest, like the
figure in a cuckoo clock. Down to the saucer he would fly, fill
his beak, return to the nest, and then away like a bee that is
seeking fresh honey. How many times an hour those birds
returned to the nest I should be afraid to say. I should think
on the average they came every minute for eight or nine hours
on end. Picture that, and then calculate the amount of food
consumed and what it means to rear a nest of insectivorous
birds ; and mind you, nothing else but insect food will do. If
the saucer happened to be empty, the moment I entered the
aviary there would be the cock and hen clinging to the wire or
hopping uneasily about, and saying as plainly as they could by
their actions, " Now then, where are those eggs?"
Time passed, and day by day the voces clamantiu 7 n grew
more and more insistent, and my spirits rose correspondingly.
Only late in the evening did the feeding cease. At last there
came plethora, and each little bird felt satisfied.

362 On the successful Nesting of the White-throated Finch.
The first youngster left the nest on August the 3rd, and
the second on the following day. They were funny little things
about half the size of their parents, with light brownish fawn
plumage, white waistcoats, darkish legs, lead - coloured beaks,
black eyes, and queer little bob tails. Both parents were most
attentive to their every want, and woe betide the bird that
incautiously ventured too near them ! The two little things
would sit as motionless as statues for hours on end, except when
being fed, when they kept up a continuous plaintive cry. The
old birds always got above them to feed.
One morning I had a narrow escape from losing the old
cock, for he got between the glass front and the window, and
but for my timely visit would have perished incontinent; but
then, narrow escapes are as good as broad ones !
The Wliite-tliroated Finch has very little voice. The ken
has a solitary chirp, something like a Sparrow's. The song of
the cock reminds me of a remark of Kingslake's when listening
to a zither: "I like that music, it is almost as good as none at
all."
With regard to food, these little birds are very easy to
please: they prefer millet, then canary seed, and, if you can get
it, flowering grass finds first favour. Cuttle - fish bone they
much appreciate.
I have had the nest photographed, as it is such a beautiful
structure--so strong and yet apparently so fragile.
The eggs are rather large for the size of the bird, and very
much like those of our garden or common Sparrow. I took one
out of the second nest (for the hen is sitting now), after I was
sure of the first youngsters; otherwise nothing would have
induced me to look.
The little hen is sitting steadily as I write, and will no
doubt bring off another brood with luck. Blessings never come
alone !
When I shewed the young birds to Mr. Oates, one of our
members, on August the iStli, he eyed them with all the fervour
usually bestowed on a holy relic.

The Breeding of the Australian Swamp-Quail. 363
THE BREEDING OF THE AUSTRALIAN SWAMP-
QUAIL.
Syncecus australis.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
As might be expected in a species with so wide a range as
the whole Continent of Australia, the Swamp or Brown Quail is
subject to a certain amount of variation, and Gould considered
that three distinct species existed on the mainland and a fourth
in Tasmania. His S. diemenensis, the Tasmanian form he des-
cribed as " fully a third larger than the Synoicus australis ," with
the markings of the upper surfaces more numerous and varied.
6*. sordidus was described by him as differing from its congeners
" in the absence of any variety in the markings of its plumage,
in lieu of which all the feathers of the upper surface have a
broad bluish-grey stripe down the middle." His .S&apos;, cervinus , the
so-called Northern Swamp Quail he distinguished by its small
size and more delicate and sandy-buff colouring. From a careful
study of the large series of specimens in the British Museum
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant considers it clear that the characters on which
Gould relied are mere differences due to age and sex, and that
all the forms are merely stages of plumage of one and the same
species. Mr. A. J. Campbell, on the other hand, remarks: "If
ornithological geography counts for anything, Gould's northern
varietjg N. cervinus , may be distinguished by its more delicate
and sandy-buff colouring, the eggs being invariably of a uniform
dull or cream-white, without markings, while the western variety,
*S&apos;, sordidtis, is altogether a more sombre-coloured bird, and has
reddish legs instead of yellowish, as in the other varieties. I
think the fact of 6&amp;quot;. sordidus possessing different coloured legs is
at least some evidence in favour of keeping that bird separate."
Probably as soon as the coming system of tri-nomial
nomenclature is thoroughly established, as it is bound to be
before long, the three local races will be subspecifically dis-
tinguished, the northern birds, which are the smallest, as N.
australis cervimis and the western as N. a. sordidus , while the
typical specimens from the south will be S. a. australis; but

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
from the point of view of the aviculturist it is sufficient to
regard S. australis as a single spcies inhabiting the whole of
Australia and Tasmania.
The Swamp Ouail is about 7J inches in length, and in its
general appearance resembles a very small Partridge. The
colour of the male is reddish-brown, most of the feathers having
greyish centres, and the whole being very finely pencilled with
zigzag black lines. The female is easily distinguished, being
chiefly brown, coarsely spotted and streaked with black, the
feathers of the back having whitish stripes down the centre.
Of the wild life of this species Gould writes as follows :--
"Although this bird and its allies are ordinarily known in Aus-
tralia under the trivial name of Quails ( Coturnix ), they are really
more nearly allied to the Common Partridge of the British
Islands, so renowned for the goodness of its flesh, and for the
healthy pastime it annually affords to all who follow the sport of
the field. Although much more diminutive in size, the Austra-
lian bird offers in many points of its economy a great similarity
to its antipodean ally. The localities most suited to its habits
are thick grassy flats and humid spots overgrown with herbage,
by the sides of rivers and water-holes. The call is very similar
to that of the Common Partridge, and like that bird it is found
in coveys of from ten to eighteen in number, which simul-
taneously^ rise from the ground and pitch again within a hundred
yards of the spot whence they rose. It sits so close that it will
often admit of being nearly trodden upon before it will rise.
Pointers stand readily to it, and it offers perhaps better sport to
the sportsman than any other bird inhabiting Australia. Its
weight is about four ounces and three quarters, and its flesh is
delicious."
It is only on very rare occasions that Synceacs aiistralis can
be purchased in this country^ in fact I have only once had an
opportunity of purchasing a pair, though I have quite recently
succeeded in getting a few brought direct from Australia.
It was on the 22nd of March this year that I succeeded
in purchasing a pair of these quails which had just arrived with
the pair of Tur?iix varia , whose history has already been related
in this magazine. When first loosed into a large aviary they

were extremely sliy and kept in close hiding amongst the shrubs
and long grass ; but before many weeks had passed they became
comparatively tame. They kept close together, and if by chance
they became separated they would immediately utter their call
which consists of two notes only.
Towards the end of May the first two or three eggs were
laid, but the birds had not settled upon a nesting site. On the
6th of June I discovered one egg in what was evidently intended
to be a nest. It was merely a slight " scratch " lined with a few
stems of grass, beneath the shelter of a few sticks and a little
coarse grass. The following day a second egg was laid in the
nest, but later in the day both eggs had been rolled out. I re-
placed them, and the next day a third was laid. O11 June 16th
the hen commenced to sit 011 nine eggs.
During incubation the cock was rarely far from the nest,
and whenever the hen came off to feed he would join her and
ofifer her any delicacy he chanced to find. On the 6th of July
the cock joined the female on the nest, and later in the day the
pair emerged with a brood of seven chicks. In size these were
about equal to those of the Common or the Rain Quail; their
colour was dark brown, with the usual game-bird striping on
the head and back of a rather lighter colour.
Old and 3^01111 g were shut into a small wire run, a pre-
caution I now invariably adopt with Quails, as it prevents old and
young becoming separated through fright or otherwise, and safe-
guards them against the robbeiy of their insect food by the other
occupants of the aviaiy.
The 3 ? oung of some of the Quails can be reared on little
besides soft food, so long as this contains plenty of tlie yolk of
fresh hard-boiled eggs; but there is nothing so good as fresh
ants' cocoons (the dried are next to useless) if these can be
obtained, and in this case the young birds were chiefty reared
on this diet, soft food with finel} r chopped grass and chickweed
being also eaten. The young grew apace, and, as with almost all
young game-birds, w r ere capable of flight when about ten days
old.
The Swamp Quail is strictly monogamous, both parents
taking charge of the young, a habit which separates them from

the true Quails of the genus Coturnix which appear to be poly-
gamous, the males of the latter genus taking no notice of nests
or young, but proceeding to find other mates immediately those
they have paired with commence incubation. I11 the case
of Syncecus both parents continued to brood the young until the
latter were too big for such attentions, and when nearly full
grown old and young would keep together in one family-party.
At about two months old the sexes of the young were distinguish-
able, the plumage of the two cocks being slightly more pinkish
than the hens and their markings less coarse.
A SMALL AVIARY IN THE HILLS IN INDIA.
By Capt. G. A. Perreau.
I have alwa3^s been very keen on keeping small birds in
outdoor aviaries, but until comparatively lately have not been
able to indulge in the luxury in India owing to frequent changes
of station. However in 1S9S I joined my present regiment at
Bakloh, a small station in Chamba State, which borders on
Jammu and Kashmir in the &apos;North-Western Himalayas. The
station stands nearly 5,000 feet in altitude and is 40 miles from the
nearest rail station. Like other Gurkha stations it is a permanent
station, i.e., one does not move in relief to other places, but
always comes back after temporary absences elsewhere (which
are pretty frequent), such as garrison duty on the frontier,
camps of exercise, &amp;c. These absences are often very nice and
are certainly good for one, but they form the greatest drawback
to successful bird-keeping, and effectually put a stop to keeping
any but hardy seed-eaters, as will be shown later on. Our Aryan
brother, with few exceptions, cannot be trusted to look after birds
in the prolonged absence of the owner, unless he has practically
no excuse for things going wrong. I find that giving fresh water,
seed and a little green stuff, with perhaps an occasional clean out
and a bit of cuttle-fish bone is as much as I can expect from my
Mali, who in addition to his duties in the garden, looks after the
house and the biids during my absence. Of course my con-
demnation only includes men of the lower menial class, and

even then the exceptions are most marked, but difficult to get,
and when got they can hardly be spared away from oneself.
I will try to give a general idea of the conditions of bird
keeping up here, and it must be understood that advantages and
disadvantages are looked at purely from the avicultural point of
view. Take the worst first. Undoubtedly the frequent absences
are the worst.
Next (now happily a thing of the past) comes the still
more frequent change of house. A word of explanation is
required here. All the houses here are the actual property of
officers, and as there are more officers than houses and no room
to build more, it means that unfortunates that have no houses
have to keep moving on as houses are vacant through officers
being away, furlough, &amp;c. It is very annoying, as one may have
to move every three months or so. However, I am now a lucky
householder.
Being some distance off the rails has its drawbacks con-
nected with supplies. Fruit, except at certain short seasons is
difficult to get except at (to me) prohibitive rates. Insects are
not procurable in winter, but this might be got over by drying
insects in the summer. But the best remedy for both of these
drawbacks is to keep only seedeaters, as the keeper in the
winter (when we are nearly always away) affects this question
really more than the difficulty of supply.
Then there is the difficulty of getting the birds one
wants. This remark generally raises the suggestion of Indian
birds, but would any one kindly suggest nice Indian birds that
would suit me ? I am not keen on Buntings, True Finches (?),
&amp;c., as my special hobby is Grassfiuches, Waxbills, and the
smaller Parrakeets. Munias are not over interesting, the Red
Avadavat I have, the Green and Pintail Nonpareil I have been
trying to get for some time past. What remain ? In my opinion
the nice Indian birds are non-seedeaters, and some of these are
very very nice. I have reared a good many sorts from the nest,
but I do not care for letting them go every autumn, handi-
capped when they will shortly have a hard fight for a living.
Just now I would willingly swop a nest of Chestnut-bellied
Rock-Thrushes or Pied Bush-Chats, for two hen Cut-throats

Capt. G. A. Perreau,
This point seems to take up more room than is necessary, but I
feel as if I must say a good deal as I am always being asked why
I do not keep Indian birds, the usual suggestion here being the
Paradise Flycatcher or the Purple Sunbird, both useful sug-
gestions of birds which want little care. I'm afraid I some-
times answer rather shortly to the effect that I want one sort and
do not want another--a cock Bird of Paradise would be of no use
to me if I had set my heart on a hen Sparrow, though I probably
could not resist the former. It is not as if my hobby started
yesterday : I have kept birds ever since I can remember, starting
foreigners seriously in an outdoor aviary in 1888 or 1889, and
kept it up till my departure in 1895 ; re-started an aviary seriously
in 1901 early in the year, and now find the hobby a severe
though delightful tax on my time and purse. I might also
mention that I have also done a good deal of cabinet collecting,
all specimens shot or trapped by myself. So though while
acknowledging vast ignorance on birds, especially some of even
the commoner genera, I hold that I have had enough experience
to know what genera will suit me best; suggestions as to
particular species or better still as to how to get them at non-
prohibitive cost will be thankfully received. I must apologise
for having let my pen run away with me, my fear of the usual
(not unnatural by the way) suggestions must be my excuse.
By the way 11011-seedeaters are not taboo to me, they are charm-
ing, but I have good reasons for not going in for them except in
special cases. I shall be delighted to keep a few for special
reasons, such as endeavouring to clear up any particular vexed
point, and will willingly give a list of birds if required, about
which I might be able to make the required observations. Many
of the fairly common birds here are not apparently very well
known at home. I find seedeaters pretty well fill up my spare
time.
Climate had better come next: on the whole I certainly
score in this point over aviculturists at home, especially in the
late spring and the autumn, but even at these seasons we get
terrific storms, wind strong enough to blow down nests even
without the usual accompanying hail. The proverbial Pigeon's
egg is not in it with our hailstones, which are in fact too big to

do harm to the birds which are protected by the ^--inch mesh
wire. The summer is beastly hot even for the birds, though of
course it is cool compared to the plains. The winter on the
other hand is beastly cold, lots of frost and snow and biting
wind. I have felt the cold much more up here than at home, but
that is probably owing to the startling and trying variations of
temperature.
Cheap feeding is another advantage for seedeaters ; millet
is only ^d. to at the most fd. a pound ; canary and hemp run to
about 3^d. a pound in bulk landed up here. After the rains there
is abundant wild millet (a small kind) and numerous other wild
seed grasses ; green stuff is a great difficulty in the hot weather.
Construction of aviaries ought to be cheap, but I have
found the handy man I used to get hold of at home
infinitely cheaper, and as for rapidity of work and "pukka"
work there is no comparison. Natives can build an ordinary
bungalow with quite decently fitting door, &amp;c., but they cannot
see why the planks on the roof should fit close together, at any
rate one may watch them lay four or five planks correctly, go
away for an hour or so, and you may bet that the new planking
has to come off. This will happen many times. As for wire-
work--the language requisite is terrible, varied with patient
coaxing and sarcasm--it is very wearying ; fortunately I go in for
rough carpentry a bit myself. I must own that for some time
past we have been unfortunate in having great difficulty in
getting mistris at all as they are nearly all required for work on
the barracks.
Among minor drawbacks must be counted the very
limited market for young and surplus birds; this may sound
grasping, but any one who has tried it will know that it is a
drawback. I should be more than satisfied to get a little less
than half the buying price up in this part, which in turn are
(and rightly too in retail so to speak) quite half as much again
as Calcutta and Bombay prices.
Another drawback in a small way is solitude in avicul-
ture. One is put down as more or less mad, and pigeons and
fowls are always being suggested as more fitting animals to
keep, as if anyone who has watched young own-bred Gouldiaus

Capt. G. A. Perreau,
could ever go back to poultry. I am afraid I shall get few
converts till I can show a good fat sum for birds sold, then some
people will try probably with disastrous monetary results at
first, yet they will be caught at any rate in some cases, and then
it will be my turn to jeer ; but I shall not do it, but perhaps will
show my accounts on the expense side, it would cheer up anyone
who has once started, but is calculated to make outsiders shy off
aviculture : however, better days are close at hand even with a
very poor market. I might mention here that most of this
paper was written last February, and that things have moved
considerably in the bird line since then ; not only have my new
aviaries been completed, but more birds have been received, and
I have been considerably more fortunate in breeding. However
I will try to keep as much as possible to the period before this
year, as the new birds and the new aviary mark a new era
for me.
Now to the aviary itself, and birds. I fear it will seem
uncommonly small to most of our members, and the birds very
common, but it and they have given me a great deal of pleasure.
The whole account is probably more suited to the early numbers
of the Old Series, but editors are believed to have blue or red
pencils, and something of interest may be found in this rather
lengthy account in which rarities have no place.
My second severe attack of bird fever was contracted in
1900, whilst at home on furlough, a pair of Zebra Finches proving
my downfall, as in my first attack. It grew gradually until my
departure for India in January, igoi, with a nice little cage full
of Waxbills, &amp;c. I picked up more at Bombay, making 70 in
all; about 60 reached Bakloli. The very first night a cat got at
them and killed 10, of course odd birds spoiling another 10 for
breeding purposes.
Luckily there was a cage (6ft. by 3ft. by 2^-ft.) available,
belonging to a bird-loving lady, who has since unfortunately left
the station. This cage is now my property and has come in very
useful. The birds were put in this till my aviary was built. The
birds were in the aviary at the end of May, nearly two months
after arrival in Bakloh, thanks to slow work.
The whole aviary only measures in feet 14 by 4 by

6 high, and is not strictly ail outdoor one as it has always lived
in a verandah, but quite outdoor enough in the winter. It is
made in two parts to hook together for portability--a great
consideration. The floor is of planks. A slit runs along the
entire length of one side to allow of trays (tin mounted on
wood) being slipped in from outside to keep the floor clean.
The trays of the wire part are made in two to hook together if
necessary, and I have found this half-tray very useful for slipping
in small luxuries. The trays are sanded.
One part (6ft. by 4ft.) is made of wood and glass, the wood
being in panels covered with blanket and tarpaulin for warmth
and to keep the rain off. Blanket sounds bad for insects, but as
yet I have had no bother with mite except round one Canary's
nest, and this in spite of my never having had the aviary empty
for a thorough disinfection. I meant to do it this spring, but the
birds I put in as a temporary measure mostly started breeding,
and I did not care to turn them out as I intended, so I see no
chance of a real cleaning till the autumn, when the inside will be
painted ; there is some difficulty in seeing into the brushwood
at the far end at present. Half of the top half (near the wire part)
is of glass (fixed) on each side. Besides this there is a small window
(ift. square) on each side, and the back to open if required.
In front, opening into the wire part is a half-glazed door, 5ft. by
2ft. wide in two parts to allow the top part (2ft. by ift.) to open
separately as a window. The other half of the front is similar
except that only the window can be opened. These doors and
windows are open or shut according to season. The back is
covered thick with brushwood.
The outside part requires little description, being all of
#-incli mesh wire galvanised. Add perches (natural and made,
placed to give as long a fly as possible and not over food or
water), boxes, nests, dishes for food and water, and you have my
first Indian aviary, small, but productive of much pleasure.
. A small door leads into the wire part from outside in
front, i.e., a 4ft. end, so called as the birds are mostly looked at
from that end, owing to being in a verandah. This fact and
necessity for portability account for its comparative narrowness,
though I must say I prefer this shape to an aviary of say 8ft. by

Capt. G. A. Perreau,
7ft. : as it allows a longer fly. I had also inner double doors 2ft.
from the outer door, but took them down as being unnecessary.
One hen Gouldian once dashed past me, being frightened by a
newly put in Cockatiel, but she had young and was soon
caught.
I had meant to go into all the ups and downs of aviary
keeping out here, but after all they do not differ much from the
ones at home and this is already a terrible length, so I will give
only an outline as brief as possible of results.
In 1901 no young were fully reared, lots of eggs and a
good many young hatched, the chief reason for failure being
shifting house, and overcrowding. When changing houses the
birds were all shut in the wooden part, the parts unhooked and
carried separately to their new quarters by an army of coolies,
very upsetting to a bird's household arrangements. 1902 gave
two young Java Sparrows, otherwise it was much the some as
1901, less crowding, but I had to go to Chitral in September in
the middle of the best breeding time out here.
Returned from Chitral in December, 1903, to find t.en odd
birds left from the 60 I left behind : theft of course, probably by
the sweeper I left in charge. However he departed for other
and ghostly regions before my return, so he escaped my
righteous wrath.
Among the survivors were a pair of Goldfinches (Hima-
layan), a Desert Finch, a nearly bald Red Avadavat (hen), an
Orange-clieek, and I forget the rest. After the supposed theft,
which took place in January, 1902, all my birds were put into my
6ft. cage, which is quite open except at one end (3ft. by 2jft. high)
in a very exposed position as close to the sweeper's quarters as
possible. I wonder any survived especially as they were fed for
some months on millet only, the boy in charge swearing that he
had lots of seed. None of the birds looked too fit and the hen
Avadavat still wants feathers, however she successfully reared
three young in 1904.
I with difficulty scraped together a few birds, Canaries,
Cockatiels (who were put into a smaller cage for most of the
breeding season), Red Avadavats (three cocks and a hen), Baya
Weavers and Spice Birds. I also had two lovely pairs of

Gouldians, great travellers brought for me from Calcutta to
Chitral by a Commissariat Agent. The Blackhead hen died
egg-bound after an unsuccessful attempt to rear a brood in camp
in February, 1904. With this lot I was fairly successful, three
broods of Avadavats (11), and after many good attempts, five
beautiful young Redheads were successfully reared to be
independent, of which one died soon and one hen died in the
winter. I have three splendid cocks now in full plumage, they
never showed any black where the red feathers were coming.
Unfortunately I lost the old cock in changing cages in the house,
and he was out of the window like a flash. I put out the lieu in
a trap-cage as a decoy, not noticing a hole in the cage, so I lost
her too. This was in October last when I was off to camp for
the winter, and my hurry must be my excuse for my careless-
ness. I funked leaving them out for the winter, I wish I had
now, especially as they had eggs nearly due to hatch then. The
pair went off very happily, and I never saw them again. Four
of the eggs I put into a Spice-bird's nest, leaving four of their
own as well. Judging from the noise my wife thinks that all
hatched, but, as is often the case with a first nest, no young lived
to leave the nest. As the only other birds that might have done
anything were the Goldfinches, I was rather pleased with the
results.
With the exception of part of the winter of 1901-2, and a
short bit at the end of 1903, I have been away every year for the
winter. One pair of Zosterops ( Palpebrosa ) survived a winter
chiefly on atta (coarse flour) my man forgetting my instructions.
However they looked very fit and had thoughts of nesting
during the next summer. These birds were generously fed while
I was at Bakloh, and I fancy the wild ones up here get very little
insect food in the winter, their staple being rotten wild medlar.
I have often watched a flock at work when the snow has been on
the ground. Very fascinating wee birds. My pair used to fly
up to me with a shriek of joy, and search my fingers for flies.
Their chief treat was a large broken open pupa, atlas- or moon-
moth for choice.
One word as to food and I am done. All my dishes are
placed inside another to save mess to a certain extent. The only

other thing perhaps calling for mention is what I call "net-
sweepings," I have recollections of seeing it mentioned in one
of Dr. Greene's books, but it may not be generally known.
Sweep an ordinary strong butterfly net over grass for ten
minutes or so, giving the bag an occasional bang on the ground
to keep the occupants quiet, and you will find a lovely collection
of grass seeds and small insects, which when turned out in the
aviary will give most birds a treat.
I really did mean to finish here, but I remember two or
three other things I wish to mention. Canaries out here are
real beasts, I had no bother with rearing them at home, but here
the programme always ends up in dead young at ages varying
from two to fifteen days old. They are seldom deserted, simply
die in turn. I have tried egg and no egg, solitary pairs in cages
and in the aviary, also flocks--same result. The old birds look
very fit and the cocks sing beautifully. I am just letting them
rip now, but I may begin with a fresh stock, if opportunity
offers. I expected them to pay some of my seed bills, as they
are always easy to find a market for, whereas one might find a
difficulty in selling even a Painted Finch.
My young Goulaians left the nest--but no, my notes on
moults can well wait, or I shall never finish.
Hope soon to send you an account of my new aviary.

Since our last "notes" appeared great things have hap-
pened at the Zoo. ; the new Wader's aviary to the north of the
Dion House has been finished and stocked, and is now by far the
prettiest aviaiy in the Gardens. On the shelving beach in the
foreground may be seen Plovers, Avocets, Godwits, Knots, Ruffs
and other small waders, while Turtle-doves and most of the
commoner European birds frequent the bushes at the back. A
Swallow appears to be perfectly happy hawking for insects over
the waters, and Kingfishers may be seen darting from one end of
the aviary to the other or perched on twigs at the waterside.
The very fine Gulls' aviary--the largest aviary in the

Several very interesting birds have recently been added to

July 28th, and a Streaked Laughing - Thrush ( Trochalopterum

The Screamers in the Eastern Aviary recently hatched
four chicks, all of which unfortunately died. I11 the Western
Aviary a pair of Imperial Fruit Pigeons {Carpophaga hisularis&apos;)
have hatched a young bird which appears to be doing well (Sept.
5th) and the same may be said of a young Nicobar Pigeon in the
same aviary.
A very notable and satisfactory event is the hatching of
a brood of eight Rheas in one of the Paddocks adjoining the
Ostrich House. Last year two hybrids between the Common

died ; the present brood has been incubated in the natural way

left Cairo for the Sudan 011 May 10th, last, and returned on August loth
with about fifty mammals (including three African Elephants, one Giraffe,

TERMITES AND ANTS AS FOOD FOR BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998905178571429" page_id="32656962"  page_num="376" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The remarks of Dr. Butler in the Magazine for July concerning
the use of "dried flies," and dried " ants' cocoons" as food for insectivorous
birds reminds me of a matter I wish to ask about through the Magazine.
Since coming out again to India, I have started a small aviary. It has
a fairly large outside flight and doubtless many flying and creeping things
are captured by my insectivorous birds there. I give in addition a daily
ration of the young of the " white ant."
Those of our members who have been in tropical climates will need
110 description of these insects, suffice it to say that for their size there is
nothing in the world so destructive. I11 fact, with the exception of their
being a capital food for insectivorous birds it is difficult to discover any use for
them in the scheme of creation. These insects raise great mud pyramids
inside of which, and generally below ground level, they make their nests.
The nests themselves are composed of a very delicate paper-like comb
which, on being broken open, is found to contain a seething mass of pure
white young ants. These the birds eat with avidity.
There is, however, another species of insect which is even more
greedily devoured. It is about J to \ an inch long and has four gauzy
wings. It appears in the rainy season, generally after heavy rain, issuing
from the ground literally in millions. One short flight is the extent of
their powers, they then drop to the ground and their wings fall off, and as
far as I can make out they get underground as quickly as possible. Now
everything eats this insect. The natives of the country, dogs, Kites, Owls,
bats, frogs, lizards and every bird.
Now I think if one could discover a way to preserve these insects
more or less intact, they would be a most valuable insect food. Could any
of our members suggest any way ? Could they be preserved in syrup like
fruit, or could they be boiled and tinned like preserved meat? Compulsory

education for natives lias not yet, thank goodness, become a law in this
country, and one could employ small native children at an infinitesimal
sum to collect the insects. Of course one would not need to use preserved
insects in this country, but one hopes to return to one's native land sooner
or later, and then the insects would be invaluable.
We call these insects " flying white ants" but I am sure the name is
quite incorrect. W. Tweedie, Captain,
Poona, India . August io th, 1905. 92 nd Highlanders.
The following reply has been sent to Captain Tweedie:
You are probably aware that the so-called 'White Ants' of the
tropics belong to a different Order of Insects from the true ants, although
in their social pecularities they much resemble them. Young Termites (as
White Ants are called scientifically) are active creatures somewhat
approaching the adult insect in form ; so that your expression 'the young'
is not inappropriate : but true ants at the same stage are like white maggots.
I see no reason why the soft-bodied young of Termites should not be
preserved in bottles with syrup, after the manner of preserved fruits.
The adult insects which emerge from holes in the ground after rain,
are, I should think, males and females of true ants, which only use their
wings during the short pairing flight and then lose them permanently.
With us the common garden ant swarms about the middle of August; and
thousands are eaten by our wild insectivorous birds : these insects would, I
think, be more satisfactory preserved by drying in a slow oven ; and, from
their rather pleasant smell of formic acid, would certainly be preferable to
the evil-smelling water-bugs known as Dried Flies. A. G. BuTEER.

THE IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.9987073125" page_id="32656963"  page_num="377" year="" vol="">
Sir, --At the discussion of one of the last papers read before the
late International Ornithological Congress, I gave expression to some
thoughts concerning Foreign Cage Birds.
A little further elucidation of what I meant to say, may perhaps
interest some of your readers.
I11 some of the daily papers I was incorrectly reported to have
advocated the suppression of the trade in African Finches.
What I did advocate was the suppression of the evils resulting from
overtrading in cage birds and especially in those of African origin.
I mean by overtrading the capture of multitudes of small birds and
parrots in the Colonies, and shipping the poor things to Europe in over-
crowded cages and without proper care during the voyage.
The object of the trader is to put as much of this living merchandise
on board the steamers at the lowest price possible. The more closely the
birds are packed, the less cubic space their cages will occuoy on the ships,
hence so much less freight will the shipment of .some hundreds of

thousands cost. Such huge shipments reach Liverpool, Antwerp, Hamburg,
Marseilles and Italian ports frequently.
The overcrowding results in tainted food, foul water and great
mortality during the voyage.
The surviving birds are sold as quickly as possible on arrival at the
European ports.
If the imports are large the price falls to a very low figure. Because
they are so cheap, thoughtless people who know nothing about bird-keeping
bny these birds for themselves or to give them to children, in whose hands
they mostly die soon from want of proper care.
I wish to protest against this overtrading which consists in shipping
thousands of birds on the chance of some hundreds arriving alive and sale-
able, and which results not only in cruelty, but in the fact that many of
these birds, though living on arrival, have contracted blood-poisoning or
other disease and die soon after.
The genuine bird lover does not want to see hundreds of one species
on the market, when a few dozen would satisfy all the intelligent buyers.
He is quite willing to pay a fair price for healthy birds, and does not want
large numbers of sickly birds cheap, and to see them die from preventible
disease contracted on the voyage to this country.
Owing to the overtrading of the present day it has become exceed-
ingly difficult to buy newly arrived birds in fairly healthy condition. Any
one buying a dozen of the beautiful Cordon-bleu African Finches newly
arrived will be lucky if with the utmost care two remain alive after a week.
Our old friend, the Grey African talking Parrot, when he was brought over
singly as a pet of the sailors, used to live fifty years and more with suitable care.
Now he is shipped in boxes of twenty-five or more, with the result that
though the price has fallen to two or three half-crowns for a just landed
bird, the chance of his living is so small and the probability of his suffering
from blood poisioning is so great--though he may look quite well--that
a bird that has been some years in Europe is cheaper at #5 than the other
at as many shillings.
To stop this trade and to counteract this waste of bird-life and the
attendant cruelty the United States of America have prohibited the
exportation of birds altogether, and many of the Australian Colonies seem
on the point of doing so, if the law has not been promulgated already.
This measure seems to be too drastic to be quite wise and is perhaps
not altogether opportune.
A better remedy than prohibitation might have been the imposition
of an Export Duty of, say, One Shilling a pair of Finches and small
Parrakeets, and as much per head on Parrots.
This would give the birds sufficient value before shipment to ensure
proper care being taken of them on board ship, whilst the Duty would

produce some little revenue which no Colony despises. It could easily be
made a regulation that no cage of live birds shall be received on board
ship without a label which might be the Customs receipt for paid Export
Duty, and state the number of birds in the cage.
It should be further within the means and sphere of influence of the
many Societies for the Protection of Birds, Against Cruelty to Animals,
Avicultural and Ornithological, and what else their names may be, to obtain
from the Steam Shipping Companies trading all over the world, the issue of
a regulation that all live birds carried on board must have cages measuring
at least one cubic foot per pair of Finches, two cubic feet per pair of
Parrakeets and three cubic feet per head of larger Parrots.
Such or similar fiscal measures and shipping regulations would
render a now pernicious trade harmless, and in many respects beneficial.
This bird question is important not only to lovers of birds and
students, but possibly more so to the Colonies. The latter have every
interest to make their flora and fauna known in the old world.
Men and women who take some interest in natural history subjects
probably make good settlers in a new country. That in North America a
farmyard soon attracts the beautiful Blue Robin, whose habits are similar
to our Redbreasts and Redstarts, and that our European Chaffinch is
represented by his much brighter cousin the Nonpareil, that in place of
our Song-Thrush the graceful and melodious Mocking-bird enlivens the
country side, are facts which have some value of being made widely known,
for they may determine one and the other intending emigrant in the
selection of the part of the world where to seek a wider field for the
energies of new generations of the human race.
As regards Australia, I think that it cannot be made too much known
how many and what beautiful, perfectly harmless, little birds can be found
there. Nearly all of those being seedeaters they can easily be kept and
studied in Europe.
Stuffed skins or pictures convey but a faint idea of the beauty and
charm of a living bird.
The great majority of foreign seed-eating cage-birds become at once
reconciled to cage life, and are perfectly happy when properly cared for
and thrive much better than British cage-birds.
Some of the foreign finches breed readily in captivity, which is the
best proof of their feeling at home and happy.
But I repeat, that it is not desirable to see these pretty little
creatures sold at a price which tempts children to buy and soon forget to
tend them, or that thoughtless people who have neither the time nor the
means to care for them intelligently, purchase them like they do a cheap

NOTES ON THE WILD CANARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9987832" page_id="32656966"  page_num="380" year="" vol="">
A correspondent, who does not wish his name to appear, has sent the
following interesting communication :
Sir,-- After reading the interesting paper which Dr. Creswell is
contributing to Bird Notes on the Wild Canary, I was curious enough to
examine the historical evidence given by him, with the result that the first
four authors (in order of date) that he mentions, do not agree with his
statements. I have not yet looked up any later than Willughby.
On p. ioo of Bud Notes, Dr. Creswell writes: "No mention is any-
where made of the bird showing any green in its coloration." Taking the
authorities he quotes, the first is Turner (1544), who did not write a
description of the Canary, he wrote about the Siskin and finishes with "Of
this kind are those which England calls Canary Birds."
The next is Gesner (I have referred to the same edition as Dr. Creswell
1585, although there is an earlier one) and he states " all the feathers of the
wings and tail being of a green colour," with a marginal note to the effect
"the Canary is a green bird," and his friend Raphael Seiler, from whom he
got the account of the bird, wrote some verses describing it " as green as
grass."
Aldrovandus (1610) simply copies from Turner's account of the Siskin,
and gives no description of the Canary, Willughby (not Willoughby, and
the date should be either 1676 or 1678, not 1667) gives no description of his
own, but agrees that it is like a .Siskin and quotes from Gesner.
From the above it will be seen that three of Dr. Creswell's authors
liken the Canary&apos; to a Siskin, while the fourth (Gesner) is most emphatic in
stating it to be a green bird. Dr. Creswell also gives the wrong name and
title for "Adanson. Histoire Naturelle du Senegal (Coquillages). Avec la
Relation abregee d'un Voyage fait en ce pays, pendant les annees 1749-53.
Published in 1757," with an English translation two years later, and
Gascoigne's "Complaint of Pliilomene" which he states to be "about the
same time" (as Turner) was not published until 1576, or 32 years later.
On p. 128, Dr. Creswell continues, " Besides in 1544,.
we see from Turner that Canaries were already&apos; so common as to be even
found in English Cages."
From Turner's and Gesuer's statements it is very doubtful if Canaries
were common at this period, as Turner writes, " I11 England it is rare, and
scarcely to be found elsewhere than in cages," while Gesner, thirty-one
years after (1585), wrote "It is sold everywhere very dear, both for the
sweetness of its singing, and also because it is brought from far remote
places with great care and dilligence and but rarely ; so that it is wont to
be kept only&apos; by&apos; nobles and great men, " and it is not until nearly 100 y&apos;ears

later that Willughby, or his Editor, writes, " Nowadays there be many of
them brought over ; nor are they sold so dear but that even mean persons
can afford to buy them."
The extra-ordinary confusion concerning the habitat of which
Dr. Creswell complains, does not appear to exist, at least I have been unable
to trace it, the only reference I can find with any doubt expressed is in
Syme's "British Song Birds," (1823), and his remarks were copied into
Rennie's edition of " Montagu's Ornithological Dictionary," (1831), probably,
as Dr. Creswell states there is a confusion, they may have been repeated in
some of the handbooks of which a good number have appeared of late
years, but I have not consulted any of these, nor as they are written chiefly
for fanciers do I think importance would be attached to this portion of
their work.
The following account, by Canon Tristram in the Ibis for 18S9, pages
22--23, is very interesting and well worth reprinting as not many
recent Ornithologists have written about the bird in its wild state.
"Up to this time, though I had frequently seen the Linnet and the
Goldfinch, I had not yet found the Canary bird, but at length secured one
of a pair sitting in a peach-tree overhanging the path. The Canary is
certainly much scarcer in Canaria than in Tenerife or Gomera. In fact it
was not easy to get more than one or two in a day's ramble, while in the
other islands one might without trouble secure more in a morning than I
should care to skin in a day.
"I11 Canaria, though it descends lower than the Tintillon, I never saw
it, as I did in Tenerife, near the sea-level; but I was told that in winter it
comes down in small flocks to the coast. I often saw Canaries feeding
along with Linnets. I11 the other islands we found in May large flocks of
the national bird above the forests, among the pine trees at a height of
5000 feet. They appear to be chiefly birds of the year. Their song is
identical with that of the domesticated race, or perhaps finer. I listened to
a singing-match between a Canary and a Linnet in two neignbouring trees,
and the superior power and richness of the notes of the former were indis-
putable. Its habits, as might be expected, hardly differ from those of the
Linnet, excepting that it more affects trees and perches higher. The nest
is neat and Linnet-like, abundantly lined with goat's hair. A thriving
trade is carried on at the Port with the passengers of the African and New
Zealand steamers in yellow Canaries, which fetch a fancy price, as being the
" real tiling." I was amused to find that these birds priced at from three to
five dollars, while the real native, perfectly tame and singing as well as the
other, could be had for half a dollar." Onpookpr.

Street, Cavendish Square, W. It is a young bird and can only have been
dead a very short time ; most probably it was on its autumn migration. The
late Dr. Hamilton appears to have been the only writer on London Birds to
have noticed this species; he mentions it as a Spring migrant in the
Zoologist for 1S79. E. A. Porter.
MR. FINN ON CHINESE AVICULTURE.
Sir, --I notice that in a foot note over the signature "A.G.B.,"
attached to that portion of my last letter where I call attention to the
tardiness of Mr. Finn's denial of his statement, a point is made of this
denial having appeared in The Feathered World of June 30th, 1905.
My demonstration of Mr. Finn's illogical position had appeared in
the issue of Bird Notes published 011 June 15th, 1905, only a fortnight
before.
Therefore his Feathered World denial was as tardy in its inception as
those which have appeared and are appearing in this Magazine and Bird
Notes respectively. That for the latter was dated June 29th, and bears the
post mark of despatch of June 30th, arriving therefore after we had gone to
press for our fifth number. It will duly appear in the sixth.
W. Geo. Creswele.
Sir, --In his letter in the September number of the Avicultural
Magazine , Dr. W. G. Creswell implies that I had given him the impression
I had been in China, whereas my "information was only hear say."
I wish therefore to state that I have actually seen, in Calcutta, the
dried flies and shelled millet I told him insectivorous birds were fed on
by the Chinese, in the cages of Chinese insectivorous birds imported into
Calcutta in their Chinese cages.
Of course I did not attempt to pose as a traveller in China to Dr.
Cresswell ; nor did I say anything about bird-feeding in Japan at all.
[As no good can result from a continuance of this discussion it is
now closed.--E d.] F. Finn.

A medal has been awarded to Mr. D. Seth-Smith for breeding the
Varied Bustard-Ouail ( Turnix varia) for the first time in the United
Kingdom.
Sir William Ingram, Bart., has successfully bred Gray's Bare-throated
Francolin ( Pternistes leucoscepiis). It is believed that this is the first case
on record for the United Kingdom and it is proposed to award a medal.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous instance is requested to
communicate immediately with the Hon. Business Secretary.

"The exceedingly beautiful work on Parrakeets by Mr.
Setli-Smitk has now been published in a complete form. It is
one of the most interesting books devoted to what is termed
aviculture that has appeared, and gives as far as can be done in a
work of this character not only the most practical mode of
keeping the birds, but a vast amount of scientific information in
a popular and readable form ."--The Field.
" The work is the most complete and satisfactory treatise
which has ever been published in English, dealing with any
group of birds from the avicultural standpoint. It is an absolute
necessity for every lover of Parrakeets. We hope that the
author will see his way to deal with other groups in a similar
style ."--Bird Notes.
