REPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE YEAR 1920
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.979209958333333" page_id="10098916"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The past year lias been one of considerable trouble to the Society,
and the prospect for next year is not very bright. Late in 1919
Dr. Lovell-Iveays took over the Secretaryship, but had to resign owing
to ill-health, after a few months. His illness proved fatal in May, and
the Council take this opportunity of expressing their regret at the loss
of so valuable a colleague, and their sincere sympathy with his
family. Mr. -T. L. Bonhote, who has now returned to England, has been
elected to combine the offices of Secretary and Treasurer, the late
Treasurer, Mr. Ezra, having resigned through pressure of other business.
Dr. Graham Renshaw, who had been Editor for some time, resigned in
August, and Messrs. Seth-Smith and Pocock most kindly undertook
this office at short notice, and their subsequent offer to retain it for a
time was gratefully accepted bv the Council, and they were duly elected.
The Society, in common with all similar societies, has been badly crippled
by the large increase in the cost of printing, and unless we have an
increase in the number of members it will not be possible to carry on
without a further addition to the subscription. This the Council
hope to avoid. They trust, therefore, that members will assist the
Society by canvassing new members, and, if possible, by sending
donations, however small, to the General Expenses Fund. This will
not only help the Society through its difficulties, but by leading to
improvement in the Magazine attract new members, and enable us
to regain our pre-War status and standard of work.
For the Council,

The Society's Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a
detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from
the date of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and
be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2J inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words "The Avicultural Society--founded 1894". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

That there are unicorns : that in Arabia
There is one tree, the Phoenix' throne--one Phoenix
At this hour reigneth there."-- Tempest , iii, 3.
The Avicultural Society, seeking some emblem to symbolize its
activities, might well choose a Phoenix ; for as that legendary bird rose
reborn from its ashes, so does our Science--now no longer in eclipse,
no longer in pin-feather--soar upwards full-winged At the beginning
of a new avicultural year, with abundant record of good work behind
it, and free from the incubus of the War, the Society should adopt the
Phoenix as its crest.
The Bateleur Eagle figured opposite has been supposed to be the
original of the Phoenix. This smart little species, with maroon-
coloured back and tail and coral-red cere and feet, may usually
be seen and heard at the Zoo, uttering its cry in the early morning.
Thus in shape, colour, and habits it really does resemble the Eagle-
like Phoenix of Herodotus and others, which had golden or red plumage
and saluted the rising sun with a song. The Phoenix was reputed to
live for five hundred years ; perhaps this is a favourable omen for the
Society !

T. Hebb--An Avicultural Tragedy
a Jackal--the hues of the bird thrown up by a brilliant background--
will understand how this handsome Eagle would appeal to the romantic
fancies of the ancients.
To us the Phoenix symbolizes not merely the beginning of a new
zoological year, but also the revival of Aviculture. The renaissance
of art and literature in the sixteenth century is being paralleled in
minor degree by a renaissance of science in the twentieth. All the
later issues of the Magazine evidence the renewal of interest in keeping
live birds, and although it would be at present premature to speak of
them, several new zoological schemes well worthy of the name have
come to the notice of the Editor. Soon aviary and paddock will be
vocal with song and bright with colour, as of old ; from the ends of
the earth the bird riches of the world begin once more to flow
towards us.
The Editor thanks his contributors for the brilliant papers con-
tinually offered him, for the donations to the Illustration Fund, and for
the numerous avicultural notes supplied. His best thanks are likewise
due to the eminent naturalists who have undertaken the reviewing
of books for the Magazine.

Although I am fond of all birds, Australian species have been my
favourites. I have kept almost every kind of Australian Parrakeet and
Finch, and it has lately been my hobby to try to get them to nest.
I have had Kings, Browns, Red and Mealy Rosellas, Hooded, Many-
coloured, Pennants, Crimson-winged, Barrabands, Lorikeets, and many
others--all lovely and interesting birds, most of which I have induced
to nest, and they have reared young with me. I now have Rosellas,
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.889332">
Senegal Parrots, Blossomheads, Peach-faced and Black-faced Love-
birds, Red-rumps, and Budgerigars; the latter consist of Green,
Yellow, Blue-bred Green, and Blue varieties. The Blue Budgerigars
have gone to nest, and I hope soon to see young birds of this much
coveted colour.

I called in at Gamage's the other day ; they had just received
a wonderful consignment of African birds--Violet-eared Waxbills,
Bluebreasts, Black-cheeks, Melba Finches, and all kinds of Whydahs,
including the Queen, Pintail, Paradise, and Red-collared species. They
were the finest lot I had ever seen, and needless to say I came away
with a parcel and a much lighter pocket, but happy. The Queen
Whydahs were lovely, and at first all the lot did well. Alas ! I soon
had awful luck. One night the syphon-condenser gas-stove in the
bird-room went wrong, fumed, and filled the room with black smoke,
killing four hen Blue Budgerigars, four Queen Whydahs, four Pin-
tail Whydahs, two Paradise Whydahs, some Blue-bred Budgerigars,
and others. I was away at the time, and had the news on my return.
You may guess how I felt about the Blue Budgerigars after all my
expense and trouble in getting them ; I felt like clearing out the
survivors and never keeping another bird !
Yet, strange to say, in a day or two I began to wonder how I could
replace what I had lost, and found myself again at Gamage's and again
writing after Blue Budgerigars. I am pleased to say that a lady Member
has kindly let me have two hen Blues, and I now have two pairs again.

Amongst the favourite birds that I managed to keep through the
difficult years of the War is a fine pair of Mantchurian Cranes that
I bought from Hagenbeck early in 1912. They were, I was told,
caught in China in October of the previous year, and passed on to
Calcutta till they were tamed and accustomed to captivity, and then
deported to England in the March following, when I secured them.
They were quite adult, and the bigger bird--but the one with less
intensely crimson forehead patch and paler leaden-grey neck-stripe--
turned out to be the male. On closer examination the male has some
dullish red skin between the eye and the angle of the mouth, which is
wanting in the female, and is probably a good sexual distinction.

Though very demonstrative and noisy each spring, I had never seen
any signs of nesting till last year (1918), when the birds put together
a platform of dry sedge on the edge of the water; but there were no
further results.
However, at the end of March this last spring, and early in April,
it was evident that they seriously contemplated breeding; and on
April 13 they were pulling sedge about, and made a fairly compact
nest on a small promontory with water on three sides, just such a
place as a Swan might choose. But this was rejected in favour of a more
open position, also close to the lake-side. The nest was more sub-
stantial than that of any other Crane that has bred with me, but no
material other than the dry sedge of the previous year was used.
On the morning of April 28 we found the ground white with snow,
which remained till midday, and we had 9 degrees of frost on the glass
during the night. The female Crane was sitting with snow all round
her, and no doubt the first egg was laid that morning. Till May 15
the male Crane was never seen on the nest, but as he began to sit by
day on that date and had always shown great interest in the pro-
ceedings, I think it likely that he shared the duties of incubation all
along, as other male Cranes do, but probably at night. These Cranes
have always been delightfully tame and confiding, but though I often
ventured within a few yards of the nest one or other of the birds was
always on, and I only once got a sight of the eggs and that from
a distance.
Once I saw a Jackdaw alight near the nest while the female was
standing preening her feathers a little way off; she instantly guessed
his intentions, and rushing up with outstretched wings drove him
away. On May 31 one egg was chipped in the morning. On the after-
noon of the next day one young bird had left the shell, but remained
in the nest. The male Crane was brooding at 7.30 that evening. At
9 a.m. on June 2 the young Crane left the nest, on which the male w&apos;as
sitting, and walked to meet the female a few yards away, and took
several bits of boiled rabbit and Spratt's poultry meal from her bill.
The female then relieved the male and took charge of the remaining
egg, which was chipped, and the chick was struggling to free itself
from the shell. On the 3rd, at 7 p.m., both young Cranes were being

brooded about 5 yards from the nest. On the next afternoon both
were able to walk a little, and that evening they were brooded quite
50 yards away.
On June 9 my keeper found that the Crane family had crossed the
water (some 35 yards wide), and were exploiting a paddock where some
stray sheep were running. Later they had crossed back into their
own territory. I watched them afterwards cross the water more than
once, and it was pretty to see them make the passage. The parents
all the time kept up a " honking " note, like a distant motor-horn,
the male leading and the female coming a few yards behind, with
a young one on each side of her. The old birds could wade, but the
little Cranes swan like young Geese.
On July 10 the young Cranes looked well and had grown appreciably,
especially as to their legs. They could walk slowly along between
the parents, who caught flies off the long grass and dug up worms, etc.,
reaching out the prey to the young ones who came forward to receive
it. I could see that the young Cranes regarded me uneasily, but the
old ones took no notice, and the little ones were soon reassured.
About this time we began to miss the ducklings of several species
of Teal--Blue-winged, Cinnamon, Chestnut-breasted, Chilian, and
Brazilian--which were being reared by their parents, and unaccountably
disappeared while in the down. The Cranes had lived amicably for
seven years with the waterfowl, without ever interfering with them,
and in the previous summer (1918) several broods grew up to maturity
in the same enclosure ; but we soon had sufficient evidence to convict
the Cranes. Although the young birds were getting, besides meal,
chopped horseflesh and boiled rabbit, in addition to such animal food
as the parents could collect for them, the latter evidently settled that
the meat ration must be increased, and the results were disastrous.
One morning the old Cranes were found breaking up a half-grown
Moorhen, and feeding the young with such pieces as they could
wrench off, for, of course, they did not use their feet. 1 dared not
confine the Cranes and found it impossible to catch up the young Teal
with their parents, so I had to leave them to chance. It was sad to
see the fine broods diminishing daily, and eventually I lost nearly
forty ducklings of the above species. Besides being very aquatic,

these Cranes, even when adult, are considerable consumers of animal
food. They have nearly cleared the water within their reach of Swan-
mussels, and several times they have been seen to capture Eels, though
they leave the Roach and Perch alone.
Twice the old male, who is always the successful fisherman, whether
of Mussels or Eels, has been seen feeding the young birds with bits
which he managed to pinch off the carcase of an Eel, finally gulping
down the remainder himself. On August 5 lie was seen to bring a live
Eel ashore, and after clumsy efforts to kill it, " handed " the fish to one
of the young ones which came up, which swallowed it, still wriggling,
just as a Stork might have done.
It is well known that Cranes are devoted parents while the young
are helpless. I was struck this summer by the intelligence shown by
my birds. If a cold wind was blowing they were clever at finding some
shelter for the chicks, under the lee of a belt of growing sedge. If
a young one was unable to swallow a morsel of food that had been held
out to it the old one would take it back and break it into fragments,
and then offer the small bits one by one. The juvenile Cranes, even when
nearly full grown, uttered almost incessantly a low piping note, quite
out of proportion to the size of the bird. On September 5 one of the
young Cranes flew out of the enclosure, so I caught them up and
shortened the primary feathers. They are, I think, undoubtedly male
and female.
By the same date the fawn colour of their plumage had been splashed
with white, and the new feathers appeared rapidly during the succeeding
weeks, so that by the end of November the general coloration of the
young birds had become white, with a few fawn feathers here and there ;
the plumes, some black, others a rich fawn ; the head and neck still
fawn ; and, of course, there is no sign yet of the crimson forehead
patch. I have confined the young in an enclosure well out of sight of
the old birds, and they are walked into a shed at night as a precaution,
though even in this present inclement season they appear quite
indifferent to the weather.
It has been noticed that in captivity some of the Cranes do not
moult their primaries (which are shed altogether like those of
waterfowl) every year. My Mantchurian Cranes, though they did cast

Miss R. Alderson
Only those who have been members of the Avicultural Society
from its early days or who are intimately acquainted with its inner
history, can appreciate fully the magnitude of the blow which has
fallen so suddenly upon it by the removal from its midst of Miss R.
Alderson. Her connexion with the Society dates from April, 1896,
though it is the name of her elder sister, Miss E. M. Alderson (now
Lady Maud Robinson) which appears in the lists of members in Yols. Ill
and IV. A glance through the back volumes of our Magazine will
show the variety of the subjects upon which she wrote, and the many
different classes of birds which she kept in her aviaries or tamed round
her home ; but our Society probably owes most of all to her wise and
thoughtful suggestions made during the many years she served so
faithfully as one of its officers. She was a member of the Council for
three terms of office--from 1900 to 1905, from 1907 to 1902, and from
1913 to 1916. During the last dark years of the War, in spite of many
pressing calls, she most kindly undertook the duties of Hon. Business
Secretary ; this post she held until compelled to relinquish it owing
to ill-health, as announced in the Magazine for last November.
Although it entailed a long journey, often at most inconvenient
times, Miss Alderson never missed attendance at a Council meeting,
unless unavoidably prevented : and as the writer can testify from
having been present on many occasions, she always seemed to suggest
just what was needed for the advancement of the Society, whose welfare
she had so much at heart. She seemed to share with Royalty the
faculty of being able to say and do the proper thing just at the right
time, indeed it is very largely due to her ability as Hon. Business
Secretary during the War that our Society has emerged in such
a flourishing state to-day.

Possessed of a wonderful love of Nature, due in the first place, as
she herself has told us, to the early teaching of her mother, and endowed
with a gentle manner which speedily gained the confidence of wild
creatures, she stood in the first rank of lady aviculturists. Her first
paper seems to have been written about her Shamah, and was printed
in the Magazine for June, 1899 ; this was followed by others on Parrots
and Parrakeets, Finches and Waxbills, Cranes and Quails, to mention
only a few of the subjects utilized. Her favourite group of birds were
the Doves and Pigeons, of which probably no other private person
has kept more species, and most of her writings deal with these birds.
In 1911 she wrote a little book entitled My Foreign Doves and Pigeons,
in which some forty species are described, all of which she had kept;
this is largely illustrated by many excellent photographs, which she
herself took for the purpose. She gained six of the Society's Medals
for breeding the Lavender Finch, Orange-cheeked Waxbill, Zenaida,
White-fronted, Rufous, and Solitary Doves.
Miss Alderson was always most kind and anxious to help others.
To give but one instance during the War, she offered to look after the
birds of any one who was away on National Service ; she had a very
large circle of correspondents among those whom she had so freely
aided with her extensive knowledge of bird matters. All those who
had the privilege of knowing her personally will sincerely mourn the
loss of a true friend, and will always cherish the memory of her example
as a great inspiration. The world is indeed the poorer without her
presence, for surely can it be said that she spent her life in doing good
to others.

whether the Balearic Goldfinch is the same as the Spanish and North
African race, C. c. africanus, or whether it is more nearly allied to
C. c. tschusii of Sardinia and Corsica. The Balearic Goldfinch has
a remarkably small wing, 71-73 mm. in those I have examined.
It is, however, not so dark on the back as C. c. parva, the Atlantic
island form. If it is not C. c. africanus (there are very few specimens
of this bird available for comparison) it may be a new race worthy of
a distinct name.
*Serinus canarius serious. --The Serin Finch is fairly common in
all the islands, amongst the pines, singing furiously while hunting for
food amongst the cones.
* Passer domesticus domestic us.-- Common. I failed to see
P. montanus , however.
*Fringilla ccelebs. --Although the Chaffinch swarms in Mallorca,
I did not see a single specimen in the other two islands. The song
struck me as being much inferior to that of the British bird. Further
examination may ])ossiblv show that this bird is identical with the
Corsican Chaffinch ( F. c. tyrrhenica). In any case it is not the typical
species.
*Acanthis cannabina medilerranea. --The Mediterranean Linnet is
common in all three islands.
*Emberiza calandra calandra. --The Corn Bunting is plentiful,
particularly at Mallorca, but very difficult to get near to. It lives
in small flocks in the open meadows and is very wary.
Emberiza hortulana. --What appeared to be an Ortolan Bunting
was seen at Santa Eulalia on April 12.
*Galerida tfieJdce polatzeki. --Polatzek's Crested Lark was common
at Alcudia in the first week of April. One specimen had a well-formed
egg in its cloaca. A few were seen in the neighbourhood of the town
of Iviza, but none at Santa Eulalia. They were present in fair numbers
in Formentera. This Lark was originally described from the Island
of Iviza.
*Calandrella brachydactyla brachydactyla. --A few Short-toed Larks
were seen and one obtained in the marshes at Alcudia on April 7, and
a few seen near the city of Iviza in the island of that name.

Wagtail is very common in the marshes and pine-woods bordering on
the sea at Alcudia. Many of them seemed to spend their whole time
amongst the branches of the stunted pines.
* An thus trivialis trivialis .--One Tree Pipit was seen at Alcudia,
and two seen and one shot at Iviza on April 16. The latter turned out
to be a female.
*Anthus campestris campestris. --Two Tawny Pipits were seen
together at Alcudia on April 4, close to the shore. Both proved to be
males. This Pipit was fairly common at Alcudia. A few were met
with in Iviza, mostly close to the town. Others were also noticed in
Formentera.
*Petronia petronia. --Two specimens of the Rock Sparrow were
obtained in Iviza. I am doubtful whether they belong to the typical
race or to the Sardinian subspecies (P. p. hellmayri).
*Parus major corsus. --The Corsican Great Tit was common in all
the islands, and particularly plentiful in the pine - woods on the
mountains. Its note is quite different to that of the British Great Tit,
and on first hearing it I failed to recognize what bird the call belonged
to. No other species of Tit was seen. It must be mentioned that
this Titmouse from the Balearic Islands has been separated as distinct
from P. m. corsus by A. von Jordans ( Falco halle 9, 1913, pp. 43-4),
but more material is required before this point can be satisfactorily
settled. In the meantime I think it wiser to use the name here
employed.
*Ianius senator balms. --I saw one Sardinian Woodchat Shrike in
the pine-woods at Alcudia. Later at Santa Eulalia, Iviza, it was fairly
numerous. None were seen in Formentera. The occurrence of the
Sardinian Woodchat in the Balearic Islands has not previously been
recorded, and is of considerable interest.
*Sylvia communis communis .--The first Whitethroat was seen on
April 8 at Alcudia. Not identified in the other islands.
Sylvia curruca. --The only Lesser Whitethroat was seen at Alcudia
on April 7.
Sylvia atricapilla. --The Blackcap was one of the commonest birds
to be seen at Alcudia ; males greatly outnumbered the females. Not
nearly so plentiful in Iviza

a pair of Sardinian Warblers was seen and carefully watched in a public
garden near the city of Palma on April 2. Although not obtained they
were of course the typical species.
* Sylvia subalpina subalpina. --The only subalpine Warbler met
with was a male which 1 obtained in Formentera on April 19 amongst
some thick undergrowth ; its movements strongly reminded me of
the Dartford Warbler.
*Cisticola cisticola cisticola. --The Fantail Warbler is not common,
and I only met it amongst the very tall grass in the marshes near to
Alcudia. When disturbed it flies straight up to some one hundred feet
in the air, rising by a series of jerks, singing the while a shrill
squeaking song.
*Phylloscopus trochilus. --Both the Wood Warbler and the Willow
Warbler were fairly common in the islands.
*Ph ylloscopus sibilatrix.
Turdus merula. --The Blackbird is fairly numerous in Mallorca and
Iviza, though very wild. Not observed in Formentera.
*Ruticilla phcenicurus phanicurus. --The Redstart was first seen at
Santa Eulalia on April 12. It was common in Formentera.
*Erithacus rubecula rubecula. --On April 4 I procured a hen of the
South European Robin at Alcudia, Mallorca, the only specimen seen
by us in any of the islands.
Luscinia luscinia. --The only Nightingale seen was at Santa Eulalia
on April 14 in the afternoon. It was singing a few notes. It was not
obtained. It is therefore impossible to say whether it belonged to the
typical or the Eastern race.
*Saxicola rubicola rubicola. --The Stonechat is common in all three
islands in April, though in Mallorca we saw only males.
*Saxieola rubetra rubetra. --The first Whinchats w ere seen on April 14
at Santa Eulalia, Iviza, but not many ; a few days later w r e found them
to be numerous in Formentera. These birds w r ere certainly migrating.
*(Enanthe cenanthe. --Tw r o Wheatears seen for the first time on
April 8 at Alcudia, Mallorca. One specimen which was obtained
proved to be the Greenland Wheatear (CE. oe. leuconhoa), doubtless
passing through the island on migration. Wheatears were more

plentiful in Iviza a few days later, and also present in Formentera.
Two obtained from these islands seem to belong to the typical form,
(F. eg. cenanthe, but this point is not yet decided, the adult male from
Iviza appearing to have a great deal of white on the forehead.
Muscicapa grisola. --One pair of Spotted Flycatchers was identified
in Formentera on April 18. I did not succeed in procuring a specimen,
which almost certainly was M. grisola grisola.
Muscicapa atricapilla. --Mr. Willford tells me he saw a male Pied
Flycatcher on April 19 in Formentera. The bird was not obtained, and
is here named binomially, but doubtless belonged to the typical species.
H irundo rustica. --Swallows were plentiful at all the islands, but
not in particularly large companies. The majority were probably
H. rustica&apos; rustica on migration, but none were secured.
Chelidon urbica. --One specimen only of a House Martin was seen
on our visit, and that was on April 15, at Santa Eulalia, Iviza.

Late Breeding of Partridge. --A partridge was shot at Long
Melford, Suffolk, by Mr. Chas. Bow on November 1, a 1919 bird with
a perfectly shelled egg in it ready for laying! This beats a record of
hen Partridge on eggs, September 9, in same district some years ago.

The Egg of the Hooded Crane.-- A Hooded Crane, alas ! a widow,
laid two eggs on May 3 and G, and attempted to incubate. The egg
is large for the size of the bird, and is handsomely marked with pale
yellowish-brown and leaden-grey on a pale buff ground. I have not
seen any record that this Crane has laid in captivity before. --W. H.

Homing with the Birds. By Gene Stratton Porter. Illustrated.
London : John Murray. 10s. 6 d. net.
Any book from the pen of Mrs. Gene Stratton Porter will appeal
to Nature-lovers as only her writings can. Homing with the Birds
abounds in interesting details of bird-life in the Limberlost, recorded
by one who from her childhood was gifted with a rare sympathy with
all wild things. But from a photographic point of view this book is
distinctly disappointing. Most of the birds depicted in the full-page
illustrations are either out of focus or are obscured by worrying
surroundings. In nearly all there is a lack of gradation in the
plumage.
Obviously many of the subjects were photographed in bright
sunlight, hence the lack of soft detail in the results. In many cases
the sitter has been much too near the camera, in consequence of which
the surroundings are exaggerated and overpower the bird. This is
particularly noticeable in the male Indigo Finch (p. 74).
There is a mystery surrounding the portrait of a Cardinal singing
(p. 214). Except for the black chin, the plumage of this scarlet bird
has come out pure white ! The same ghostly result has been obtained

in the courtship of the Cardinals (p. 258). But perhaps, in this instance
one bird turned jiale with emotion !
Mrs. Porter gives the British Sparrow a truly terrible character&apos;
We in England do not hold him up as a model bird, but we have a
sneaking liking for him because he is such a typical John Bull. We
wish, as heartily as Mrs. Porter does, that we had kept this scapegrace
at home. Our British cheeks are suffused with honest blushes when
we read of his awful depravity and of his bloodthirsty cannibal
instincts.

The Amateur Menagerie Club Year Book, 1918-19. pp. 108.
Illustrated.
The Editorial apology for the size of this Year Book seems to us to
be scarcely necessary ; still the intention to increase it next year must
be sympathetically received by all amateur naturalists, on the basis
that one cannot have too much of a good thing. It is well illustrated
with photogravures and ornamented with excellent letterpress sketches,
the work of the versatile Editor, Mr. G. Tyrwhitt Drake. The paper
and printing are good, and our only comjdaint is of a somewhat slip-
shod editing that has passed certain errors in syntax and orthography
that might easily and with advantage have been avoided. The actual
utility of the book is not impaired ; it contains the sort of information
that we should all seek, i.e. facts as perceived by the observer.
Wild Life in the Balkans, by J. C. Lindlay, with its full and careful
notes on bird-life, will appeal strongly to every ornithologist. The
remaining articles are all descriptive accounts of actual zoological
experiments, illuminating by their success or in their failure showing
the way to better results. Mr. Gillespie, of Edinburgh, has been
working out the theory of fresh air versus artificial warmth, in many
cases with great success. We think that more exercise would improve
the results with the Antelopes. That Crown Cranes and Flamingoes
fail in Edinburgh surprises us, as at Manchester the former do well
with a mere shed--the latter being absolutely without cover, provided
they have plenty of room for exercise and ice-free water. He draws
attention to the joy of the Penguins and Polar Bears in hot sunshine,

but this is not surprising, as the Arctic heat radiated from the snow is
intense. Carl Hagenback noted years ago that the Polar Bears lay
stretched in the full glare of sunshine that gave Leopards heat apoplexy.
Miss Walker writes well on her Capuchins ; they are most interesting
pets and in our experience almost as clever as Chimpanzees. It is
sad to see them going off, even after four years, with rickets, or rather
a form of tuberculosis ; and we think that if she gave a small box in
which to sleep, a cage with room for exercise, and access to fresh air,
and took away the hot-water bottle, that trouble might be avoided.
We cannot close this notice without special reference to Dr. Butter's
article on his Chimpanzee " Anthony ", which should insure a place
for this volume in every zoological library in the world. Dr. Butter
for seven years kept his Chimpanzee in the open air without artificial
heat, raising it from puny childhood to perfect adolescence. He gives
us all the details of his successful experiments--he has revolutionized the
theory of anthropoid management, and wonderful to relate he is quite
unconscious that he has done something wonderful.

A Handbook of the Vertebrate Fauna of North Wales. By
H. E. Forrest. Witherby &amp; Co. pp. 106. 6.s. net.
North Wales is too large an area for any man to work alone ; con-
sequently, Mr. Forrest, when in 1907 he published his Vertebrate Fauna,
had to depend largely on correspondents and matter which had appeared
elsewhere. He. has now produced an epitome of his former work,
bringing knowledge up to date. A number of species have been added,
justly so with the birds, but in the portions dealing with mammals
and reptiles the author has been a little too anxious to swell the list.
There is no proof that the large Bat seen by Mr. Bolam was a Greater
Horseshoe ; that, on the evidence of a washed-up vertebra, the Blue
Whale occurs in Welsh waters ; nor that the identification of the Sand
Lizards was correct; they were seen, but not critically examined. The
added birds are on firmer foundation ; the most important are the
Barred Warbler, Willow Tit, Blue-winged Teal, Crane, and Great Skua.
Dr. Ticehurst and Mr. Stanford recognized many unusual birds on
migration at Bardsey, and their notes will prove to sceptical workers

that West Coast migration is more important than is usually admitted.
Judging by the Ortolan, Wryneck, and Black Redstart, many birds
which do not nest far north in Scandinavia reach the western sea-
board, almost certainly crossing England on autumn migration.
On the strength of Mr. R. W. Jones's dates Mr. Forrest might include
the Black Redstart as a regular winter visitor ; indeed, many of his
occasional visitors are far more regular than he suspects. He has
corrected his extraordinary statement that the White Wagtail does
not travel through Wales on autumn passage ; he cannot have visited
North Wales frequently in autumn. Neither, evidently, is he aware
how regular are the movements of the Manx Shearwater and Richard-
son's Skua, or he would have made a bolder assertion and not founded
his remarks upon a few scattered references.
No useful purpose is served by advertising that there still exist
breeding places of the Chough and other rare birds, which have
struggle enough to avoid the raids of collectors. Those who for long
have been aware of these breeding haunts have refrained from even
mentioning them, and have kept back their information simply for the
sake of the birds.
As a compilation there is much useful matter in the Handbook, and
it is a convenient size to take on a holiday trip ; the most important
notes that have appeared in British Birds, the Zoologist, and in books
that have been published since 1907, are here gathered together.
There is, however, little original matter, and in a few cases information
from correspondents needs sifting.

Photography for Bird-lovers. By Bentley Beetham, F.Z.S.
London : Witherby &amp; Co.
The scope of this book may best be described by quoting the author's
own words--" It is not destined to serve as a textbook of photography,
but rather as a manual for the application of that art to a given purpose
--that of bird photography." In the 120 odd pages Mr. Beetham gives
a vast amount of information, commencing with a discourse upon the
outfit required for bird photography, and following with a description
of the various methods employed in securing pictoral records of the
feathered folk.

It will probably come as a surprise to some readers to hear that
a stand-camera is more suitable than a hand-camera for photographing
amongst the top-most branches of a tree--this work being considered by
the author as most enjoyable, although at times " the lack of a third
prehensile member is sorely felt".
Chapter V on " Photography by the Stalking Method " is of special
interest, revealing the patience that is necessary for obtaining successful
results, and how easily an unfortunate movement may mean utter
failure. When approaching a ground-nesting bird, such as a Grouse,
the novice would probably creep up from the rear ; but if we follow
Mr. Beetham&apos;s advice we shall do just the opposite, zig-zagging about
and even passing the bird before we take a photograph, so as to
encourage the sitter in the belief that it has not been seen.
After reading the chapter entitled c; Pope-work on the Cliff-face ",
for which both nerve and strength are necessary adjuncts, the final
chapter on photographing birds in captivity will come as a refreshing
balm to the more sedate and elderly camera enthusiast.
Of the eighteen illustrations all are so good that it is difficult to
discriminate between them. That of the Oyster-catcher's nest includes
the bird's habitat in the picture, while that of a hiding tent screened by
reeds, in which we are told " the author is seen peeping through the
back of the hide ", is an example of perfect camouflage.
It took the present writer a quarter of an hour to find him, and even
then he did not succeed unaided.

Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- As regards Mr. Shore-Baily's query, may
I say that I have often come across cases of melanism in Quelea quelea ?
These birds are imported into France in thousands from French
West Africa, and are always plentiful in bird-shops ; in a cage of say
a hundred birds one can generally find one or two dark or even all-
black specimens.
I think this melanism is a result of the improper food the birds are
given just after they have been caught and during the journey. If
they happen to be moulting at the time, when properly cared for

Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- I think that my large Conures must be
C. byroni, and that the description in Mr. Seth-Smith's book must be
taken from hybrids between this bird and the smaller kind. I have not
the least doubt but that the two varieties would interbreed freely,
as my bird is very friendly with one of the smaller ones, and I should
not be surprised to see them go to nest this spring. The difference in
their appearance when they are side by side is striking ; it is quite
as great as it is between the Mealy and Red Rosellas. I am afraid
that my other specimen is never going to be much good. He is getting
barer of feathers on the neck, throat, and wing coverts than ever.
I don't know whether he is plucking himself or whether it is some form
of disease, but one would think that he would have some difficulty
in plucking his own throat.
With regard to the Weavers, I hardly think that the colour of
the bill has anything to do with sex. The three yellow-billed black
specimens have now moulted out into their natural colour, but their
beaks are now red. I shall be interested to see if these birds return
to their abnormal colour at their next moult.--Truly yours,
Wm. Shore-Baily.

THE PLUMAGE TRADE

Bv Willoughby Dewar (Hon. Secretary, Plumage Bill Group).
Before the War some thirty-five million wild birds' skins were
annually imported into this country. They served no useful purpose
whatever, beyond employing a little sweated labour in London's
East End, and a little more alien capital. Englishmen, one is glad
to know, have little j&gt;art in this disgusting traffic.
These millions of lovely feathered creatures were simply being
slaughtered to adorn the hats of women who never gave a thought
to the butchery necessitated by fashion. A Bill was brought before
the House of Commons in 1914 to put an end to this horror by pro-
hibiting further imports of plumage other than that of the Ostrich,
Eider Duck, and birds killed for food, excepting such specimens as
might be needed for scientific purposes. The Bill was supported by
humane men of all parties, but was virtually wrecked by the traders'
opposition, and finally shelved on account of the War.
Once again an effort is being made to stop this commerce, which
offends all those who delight in the feathered world. A Group has
been formed in London to demand another Bill, and to watch its
passage into law. Sir Charles Hobhouse, Bart., P.C., who has long
taken an active interest in the matter, is President, and Lieut-C&apos;ol.

urgently required, for the trade will again have to be fought, and the
general public will have to be roused from its apathy.
Those who love living birds, whether caged or free, must revolt
instinctively at seeing a bird's dead body, or any part of it, flaunted
in a woman's hat as though it had no more significance than a bunch
of artificial flowers or a knot of ribbon. Many, however, are still
unaware of the full horror of what they see. It is during the breeding
season that most of the birds are butchered, for it is then that they
have their nuptial dress and are most beautiful. The young, con-
sequently, are left to starve. Often the marauders do not trouble to
kill outright ; the shoulder-tufts of the Egret (the " ospreys " of
the trade) are torn from the living bird ; wings of Albatrosses are cut
from them whilst alive, and the birds are left to bleed to death.
The story of these fold details could be multiplied indefinitely,
but one must turn to another point. Whole species of birds are being
exterminated, and the result of their disappearance must be
calamitous to the world at large. One firm advertises for sale the
feathers of the Vulture, and the Vulture, as is well known, is essential
as a scavenger in many lands. Other birds, equally victimized, are
necessary to check the ravages of insects and noxious grubs. The
trader and his agents spare none.
So well is the importance of a rich bird life recognized that in
many countries, such as India and Australia, the export of all plumage
is forbidden ; but smugglers defy the law and it can only be enforced
if we in the British Isles legislate against import. Sir Auckland
Geddes has promised a Plumage Bill on the lines required, but no
definite date has yet been given for its introduction, and it is sure
to be opposed by certain Members of Parliament on whom the trade
has put pressure. We therefore call on all bird-lovers to take action.
Individually or collectively let them insist on the Government
taking action with firmness and without delay. They, too, can
approach Members of the House of Commons. They can at once
make it known that they desire a Bill making it illegal to import,
buy, sell, or wear the skin and feathers of birds slaughtered for
millinery purposes, and that the Bill must be passed without damaging
amendments.

yellow to a dirty pink or creamy white As instances, our friend
mentions the Linnet, the Red Cardinal, the Orange Weaver, the
Sepoy Finch, the Scarlet Tanager, and one or two Australian birds.
We all know that the Linnet and its allies, among which I certainly
should include the Rose Finches, lose their rose and crimson colouring
at the first moult. The Pine Grosbeak and Crossbills do likewise,
and the American Nonpareil Finch loses its scarlet underparts in
patches, becoming more and more yellow at each successive moult
if kept in* an indoor aviary or flight-cage not exposed to bright
sunlight, and if not supplied with an abundance of living insect-
food. If, however, it is removed to a sunny outdoor aviary and given
additional natural food, the red colouring is gradually restored at
each successive moult (I still have three skins of specimens formerly
living in my aviaries which indicate these facts).
Touching the Virginian Cardinal, the Orange Weaver, and the
Scarlet Tanager, my experience differs wholly from that of our
Australian friend. I have had three cock Virginian Cardinals, two of
which I have kept in large cages and the third in an outdoor aviary,
and they all retained their bright colouring to the end of their lives ;
so also did my two male Scarlet Tanagers, which lived in a bight-
cage for over eighteen years. As regards Orange Weavers, I have
remarked more than once that their colouring tends to deepen
with age. I have never known them to become paler, and I have
kept many examples ; indeed, among the twelve skins of the species
which I have preserved I have bve males in breeding plumage,
not one of which shows any deterioration in colour. The same is
true with regard to the Grey Cardinals, the Military Starlings, and
many other birds; they retain their colouring perfectly. It is true
that a pair of Pintailed Nonpareils in my possession became melanistic
after their second moult, and the abdomen of the male changed from
scarlet to yellow; but I have seen similar examples in the British
Museum series, which apparently were obtained from collectors,
so that neither captivity, lack of sunlight, nor sufficient live insect-
food could have caused the change in them.
I do not think our friend should assume, because &lt;# colour is

Arthur G. Butler -- Colour-change in Birds
pigment. On the contrary, I think the assertion that blue colouring
in birds is not due to pigment but to structural characters implies
distinctly that some other colours are due to pigment. I have never
yet seen it stated that feathers do not contain pigment; it is absolutely
certain that the scales on the wings of butterflies do, as anyone can
prove by soaking the wings of a Brimstone Butterfly in warm water
in which soda has been dissolved, when he will see the whole of the
yellow colouring precipitated, and the wing can then be dipped
into blue dye, which the scales will absorb (I have myself done this).
Because the red colouring in the wings of Touracous is stated
by various trustworthy naturalists to be soluble in water, and
especially in water more or less saturated with an alkaline reagent,
it by no means follows that other birds of red plumage must
necessarily be similarly affected. As I have pointed out, whereas
in the case of the butterflies the colouring of most scales is perfectly
soluble, other scales appear to be sealed up and do not release their
colouring ; it is conceivable, therefore, that the pigment in one
bird's plumage may find its way out of the feathers, whereas in
another bird it may be strictly confined therein.
It used to be asserted that birds with red in their plumage became
dulled and even melanistic if fed upon hemp ; I proved to my own
entire satisfaction that this was quite a mistake. I kept three species
of Grey Cardinals ( Paroaria) and fed all three with a seed mixture
consisting of canary, oats, and hemp, upon which they did remarkably
well, and the skins of those which I preserved would compare very
favourably with the examples shot by collectors and now in the
National Collection.
I kept mealworms in a large tin with a mixture of bran, middlings,
and bits of old sacking, and I never knew the colouring of any bird

avicultural studies I used to put a dead bird, mouse, or piece of fat
into the mealworm tin ; the result of this was that I went one morning
to the tin and found an atrocious evil-smelling mass of putrescence
which I had to bury; the worms themselves were all rotten. If fed
regularly upon minced raw beef, I have found that most insectivorous
birds get a bad attack of diarrhoea, and if the same diet is persisted

*Iynx torquilla torquilla. --The Wryneck was not seen in Mallorca.
One obtained at Santa Eulalia, Iviza, on April 14. This was the first
I saw, and proved to be a female. Another was procured in Formentera
on April 18. The birds in question appear to belong to typical race
and not to the Sardinian form (I. t. tschusii). The male has a wing
measurement of 88 mm. and the female a wing of 90 mm.
Cypselus opus. --Swifts were common in the city of Palma at the
beginning of April. Also seen in Formentera.
Upupa epops. --I saw one Hoopoe near Alcudia on April 6. This
was the only one seen in the islands.
*Querquedula querquedula. --A few Garganey frequented the stream
at Santa Eulalia and one was shot by Mr. Willford.
Botaurus stellaris stellaris. --A Common Bittern, a female, was
obtained by Mr. Willford at the mouth of the Creek at Santa Eulalia,
Iviza, on April 15.
* CEdicnemus cedicnemus oedicnemus. --Two Stone Curlews were seen
in Formentera and one procured. Not observed in the other islands.
Totanus totanus. --A Common Redshank was seen but not obtained
in the salt marshes in Formentera on April 19.
*Totanus hypoleucus. --A few Common Sandpipers were seen at
Alcudia, and on the stream at Santa Eidalia, and in the salt marshes
in Formentera.
*Helodromus ochrupus. --Green Sandpipers were seen along the
seashore at Alcudia and Santa Eulalia.
*CEijialitis alexandrina alexandrina. --The Kentish Plover was
common in the marshes and along the seashore.

the high cliffs at La Mola, Formentera. Probably these belonged to
the typical race and not to the North African form (C. 1. schimperi).
In the foregoing short list I have been careful only to name
birds of which I obtained specimens, or of whose identity I felt fairly
satisfied. Amongst those that were seen but not identified were :--
A Vulture, seen at Alcudia, Mallorca.
Several Harriers, which quartered the marsh in the same place.
Their backs were a ruddy brown colour, tips of wings black, wing
coverts light brown ; while the undersurface of the birds appeared to
be white.

There were also several Kites, which seemed to be black all over.
Kestrels were common at Alcudia and also in Iviza, and were the
only birds found nesting.
Several flocks of Duck were seen at some distance in the Alcudia
marshes ; they looked like Common Mallard, flying, but were too far
oft' to be identified with certainty. On one occasion I saw a Heron in
the marshes near Alcudia.
One Snipe was flushed on the stream at Santa Eulalia, Iviza, but
on account of the people about it was not safe to shoot at it.
Mr. Willford reported seeing a Golden Oriole on the day we left
Formentera, April 20. We saw surprisingly few sea-birds, and I hope
on another opportunity to make a list of them.
While waiting for our steamer to return from Iviza I saw a Sedge
Warbler and a Marsh Warbler in the swamp just outside the town,
but do not feel justified in placing them in the list as I did not get
specimens of either.
Tt is perhaps worth noting that we did not meet with a single
example of the Song Thrush nor of the Wren. Of course many more
specimens could have been procured, but I have always made it a rule
when collecting in foreign countries never to shoot a bird until I have
O O
examined it with the field-glasses and felt justified in shooting it.
The photographs which illustrate this short article were taken by
Mr. H. H. Willford, and give an idea of the kind of country in which
the birds were found.

Amongst the exhibits is a fine Emu, which lives summer and
winter in an unheated shed with a paddock adjoining. On the
writer&apos;s visit the bird stood still and silent among the long grass,
occasionally shaking its head and looking about it, or turning to
preen its hair-like plumage. Presently it walked forward with a
delicate swinging gait, the body tilted as if too heavy for the slender
legs, and the neck lowered, though still curved, as it inspected the
herbage ; the savage, hawk-like expression of the mild-natured
Emu is remarkable, and is due to the yellowish colour of the eye.
Only one of the beautifully tame Rheas survived, a fine cock, with
long, trailing plumes that almost compensated for the tailless con-
dition that obtains in these birds. In former days one had seen
this bird and his mate following their master for bread like farmyard
hens following their owner for corn.
Passing to the rows of large cages or aviaries, a Peacock was
noticed perched fast asleep, its long train swaying in the breeze.
The wind was not likely to disturb it, for these birds have been
known to sleep unconcernedly out in the open during a snowstorm,
so that their backs become thickly coated with snow. Once
domesticated, Peafowl make themselves thoroughly at home. The
writer now has before him an egg of these birds which was found at
the top of a stack in the summer of 1891, and seems somewhat
weathered, being of a pale cream colour, minutely pitted all over
and marked with a few brownish spots which may be nest-stains.
Our members are probably aware that the long train of the Peacock
is not the tail but the tail coverts, the true tail being a small, in-
significant structure.
In another roomy cage a trio of Sparrow-hawks stood stiffly
erect, with yellow eyes and barred breasts, turning their heads this
way and that. In the outdoor flying aviary the long necks of the
Herons showed snaky against the greenery, and complacent Sea-
gulls waddled to and fro like so many Ducks. In a cage opposite
a Buzzard stood with both feet firmly planted on its food, tearing
off morsels with hooked beak.
There was a fine blue-black Curassow in one of the houses, feeding
as it walked about, taking tiny rapid pecks and looking up after each

mouthful, raising and lowering its crest, flirting its tail, and opening
and shutting it sideways. A Marabout Stork ran about with huge
wings widely expanded, throwing up its head and clattering its
bill. Suddenly it resumed its sedateness, hunching its head between
its shoulders as it walked.
The Penguins were amusing. They stood upright, flippers slightly
extended, eyes closed. Occasionally one would stretch and shake
its neck, then shake its body ; in the latter case the absurd apology
for a tail shook too ! The bird next proceeded to raise its head
and flippers, and solemnly shook itself again. Another perhaps
would waddle forward, its body aslant ; all the movements of these
quaint little creatures were made with portentous gravity, as if they
were performing some religious ritual.

Every keeper of Waders, Gallinules, Gulls, and similar carnivorous
birds has doubtless at some time or other wished for a regular supply
of live food--fish, worms, snails, etc.--which would relieve him of the
daily duty of preparing their dinner. In zoological gardens this
problem is partially solved by feeding the Penguins and similar
diving birds on live Gudgeon or Minnows if they can be conveniently
obtained from some neighbouring water. Such food is, of course,
perfectly natural and therefore ideal ; some of our members, recalling
the task of preparing minced meat and so forth, may go further
and term it Utopian ! The close association between fish and bird
life, evidenced in the daily maintenance of Kingfishers, Herons,
and similar water-loving birds, demonstrates beyond cavil the close
connexion between aviculture and aquiculture.
The Editor therefore takes pleasure in drawing attention to the
newest of zoological corporations, the Cinderella of natural history,
the London Aquarium Society. In a letter recently received Mr. W. T.
Webster, the President, remarks on the rapid growth of membership

since its inception in November last. All kinds of fishes, including
the lovely tropical forms one sees at the Zoo, are to be studied, as
well as other aquatic creatures and water plants. As Mr. Webster
justly remarks, " later on the question of studying aquatic birds
is sure to arise."
The new movement is receiving valuable support from the Press
of this country and America. Thus the Editor of the Fishing Gazette
has written a powerful appeal for membership, and the Transatlantic
journal Aquatic Life has devoted three-fourths of a number to a
contribution by Mr. Webster. The new Society intends to publish
Proceedings at regular intervals ; further details will be found
elsewhere in this issue.
Slightly altering the dictum of the Roman sage, the up-to-date
aviculturist may murmur, " I consider nothing zoological to be foreign

Geese, Swans, and Seagulls will find fresh woods and pastures new

(Chrysotis lilacina)
By Allen Silver, F.Z.S., F.R.H.S.
There are almost as many species of Chrysotis as there are weeks
in the year. I have seen the greater proportion alive, and have
kept or had through my hands many birds of this group; but when
Mr. Rogers, of Liverpool, wrote to me recently saying he had an
Amazon which he had never seen before, alive or dead, I naturally
conjectured it was not a common bird of the trade. I do not suppose
anyone will disagree with me when I say that for a period of forty
years probably no man now living in Great Britain has handled
more Amazon Parrots than Mr. Rogers, and naturally under the
circumstances I was most interested to have and see the bird alive.
The owner kindly loaned it to me for observation, and for the
purpose of getting it figured. When it arrived I at once knew
I had not seen it alive before, resembling as it does C. Salvini,

C. autumnalis, and C. viridigena in parts. Reference proved it to be
C. lilacina --a small Ecuador Amazon, probably not 13 inches long
when skinned and stretched unnaturally, but much less when
perched. It is one of the smallest species, and in body plumage
much resembles the Yellow-cheeked Amazon. Its cheeks, however,
are different in colour to the Green-cheeked or Salvin's species, and,
of course, lack the facial markings of autumnalis. The bill in this
bird is black, the bare eye-ring broad, white, and pronounced. The
irides are wine-red, not yellowish, and give the bird a pleasing
expression.
The frontal feathers of the head and the lores as far as the gape
(continuing as a streak above and beyond the eye) are crimson.
The centre of the crown is dull lavender, with reddish tips to the
feathers, but this ornamentation, does not extend to the back of the
crown or the nape. Like the Yellow-cheeked Amazon, it has a red
wing speculum and no red rump.
This bird, I believe, has been referred to as viridigenalis ? and
coccineofrons, but I think the same terms have been applied to
viridigena, the true Green-cheeked Amazon. I find it a good mimic
and whistler, and it speaks a little. In disposition it is as playful as
a Lorikeet, a great climber, and very active. It was once the pet of
a West Indian coloured seaman, and arrived in very rough plumage,
which, however, is speedily changing. I see no reason why this species
should not (when well-trained and taken young) make a good speaker,
and if so it would be more attractive than some of the larger kinds.
As I have no recollection of seeing it before mentioned aviculturally
I thought it advisable to make mention of the bird in our pages.
With me it has been fed on canary-seed alternated with a mixture
of sunflower, hemp, oats, and poultry grain, and gets in addition an
occasional nut or piece of very hard and dry biscuit and a little fruit.
Upon this diet it thrives and is getting into hard and tight condition.
It may be safely described as a most attractive Amazon and well
worth its place in a representative collection of such birds.

paper free of charge, and to Mr. Rogers for defraying the cost of
reproducing the drawing.--G.R.]

Pigmy Owls. --I regret to report the death of my rare Mexican
Pigmy Owl, concerning which I wrote in the Avicultural Magazine
a few years since. I bought him ten years ago, and as he was adult
then I cannot say how old he was. He was apparently in good health
until about a week before he died, and I really think old age was
the only cause of death. Last spring he paired with a widow Jardine's
Pigmy Owl, and she laid three eggs, but unfortunately was taken ill
and died about a week later ; she too was an old bird, but not as
old as the Mexican. One egg was fertile. I am afraid it will not be
easy to replace these Owls, especially the Mexican. Mr. Astley had
one for some time, which I believe came over shortly before my
bird. I have not heard of any others being imported.
We have sustained a heavy loss by the death of Miss Alderson.
She did much for the Society and was always kind and helpful
when appealed to. Some years ago I was in difficulties over rearing
some young Doves, and Miss Alderson helped me greatly, writing
p&gt;ages of advice and suggestions, and sending me a copy of her book
on Doves, though she was, as I afterwards found out, exceedingly
busy at that time. I hope this year some good breeding results
will be chronicled in the Magazine. The arrival of the Cuban birds
will be an event. What are the " Blue Birds " and the ''Red and

The Book of a Naturalist. By W. H. Hudson. Hodder and
Stoughton. London, 1919. Price 12s. net.
Birds are not conspicuous in Mr. Hudson's new book, which
deals more with dogs and serpents, toads and fritillaries, bats and
potatoes, green lawns and the worms that help to keep them green.
But there is enough to give it a welcome place on the shelves of
every aviculturist--that is to say, if the aviculturist be broad-
minded, ready to rejoice in the observations of a naturalist who hates
birds in cages. Temperamental Mr. Hudson does not conceal his
dislikes, and flicks the raw spots with an accurate aim ; but in the
present volume he is amiable, at least so far as lovers of birds are
concerned. His only reference to birds in cages is the story of a
Thrush, sedulously but not very wisely tended. One day, so
Mr. Hudson's informant relates, the Thrush in the cage was observed
to watch intently and excitedly a wild Thrush on the lawn killing
and devouring a worm. The owner took the hint, added worms to
the diet of rape-seed and bread and milk, and the tame Thrush,
hitherto moping and dishevelled, rapidly became a happy and a
glossy bird. It is a ''tall" story, but an excellent lesson. A little
knowledge of natural diet is quite a good thing for those who keep
creatures in captivity.
Mr. Hudson, discussing life in a pine-wood, raises an interesting
problem which deserves further study. How do nestlings escape the
attacks of ants ? He collected evidence--some from essays written
by children for the competitions of the Royal Society for the Pro-
tection of Birds--that living nestlings are sometimes overpowered
by raiding ants. He suggests that ants do not visit every tree,
and that the parent birds usually select trees which they know not
to be searched by ants. This seems a doubtful theory, ascribing

lievieivs
fixity of habit to the colonies of ants, and a providence on the part
of the birds for which much evidence would be required. It is possible,
however, that the explanation is simpler, Although ants remain in
activity underground through winter, their numbers and their
enterprise seem greater in late summer and autumn, at least in
English woods, than at any other season of the year, and it may be
that the majority of nests escape because the young are fledged and
active before the visits of ants are numerous.
There are some delightful descriptions of the habits of birds, as,
for instance, of Sparrow-hawks teaching their young, of the flight
of the Humming-bird, of Herons bathing. Some tragedies of wild
life are recorded. A Guira Cuckoo was found with its head hanging
and wings drooping, struggling with too large a mouse that had
stuck in its gullet. A Painted Snipe had unwarily put its foot between
the open valves of a large fresh-water Clam, and had been caught in
this living trap. It was skin and bone when Mr. Hudson was able
to release it, but he hopes that it had a chance of surviving.
These are a few examples of the good reading that Mr. Hudson
provides. As I have already said, the greater part of the volume is
not about birds, but this will not detract from its value to
aviculturists. Those who are not merely systematists cannot confine
their interests to one group of animals, and they will watch birds to
more purpose if they also study the mammals and reptiles and
insects, the trees and flowers amongst which birds live. They
could have no pleasanter or more stimulating guide than Mr. Hudson.

bibliography can appreciate the work which the authors have put
in ; wading through journals is tedious and often unproductive.
Presumably the English counties are being first dealt with, but
it would have been wise to have stated this and to have given some
general plan of the scope of the work. It is to be hoped that
" British " means more than English. A glance at the dates of notes
for any county proves that ornithology is an ever-increasing study ;
it also shows to whom one can refer for information about the avifauna
of any district.
It is a little puzzling to understand what the authors have had
in mind when compiling the " General Works of Reference ". They
have not included Lydekker's Sportsman's British Bird Book, a really
useful volume, in spite of the fact that the illustrations are from
stuffed specimens, nor do we find P. R. Lowe's Our Common Seabirds,
which contains many county references. Bishop Stanley's Familiar
History of Birds is included in the Cheshire section, but it contains
interesting notes about other counties and deserves as good a place
as some of those included. Presumably there is some reason for
mentioning Robson's Birds of the Derwent Valley under Cumberland,
for it is, rightly, also included in Durham. The book is to be com-
pleted in six parts.

Part II of this useful work deals with the English counties from
Essex to Middlesex. It is difficult to judge if all counties have received
the same care and attention, but the literature appears to have been
carefully searched. Lancashire is fairly full, but there are one or two
publications which have not been thoroughly examined.
A word of explanation why certain items are included would be
an advantage ; for instance, Doubleday's Remarks on the Entomology
of Epping. The word appendix " added to Ewing's Some materials
for a Flora of Wroxham would have been sufficient, and possibly there
is similar reason for including notes on insects.

To the uninitiated in matters bibliographical the use in some
instances of " T.c. " and in others "Op. cit." is confusing. Indeed,
it is not clear that any rule has been systematically observed. We
look forward to an exjdanation.
It is, however, only fair to state that these faults, and one or two
misses in proof-reading, do not detract from the real value of the
bibliography, but as the work will undoubtedly be used by all serious
workers in the future it would be well to make it as straightforward

Dear Dr. Renshaw, --Would a few notes on the mimicry of the

Personally I think the wider the range of subjects we publish

for whom I could make any inquiries or investigations as to birds
there, I should be glad to do anything I can. Sometimes information
can be obtained by an inquirer on the spot which is difficult to get
by mail. If you think it worth while perhaps you will put a note
in the Magazine. Shortly before the War a friend of mine sent out
a lot of Black Grouse, Willow Grouse, etc., to New Zealand, and they
arrived surprisingly well and I hope are flourishing.

Dear Sir,-- I shall be greatly obliged if you can tell me whether
it is now possible to obtain a few copies of the coloured plate (by
G. E. Lodge) of the Amherst Pheasant in display, published in the
Avicultural Magazine, 3rd series, vol. iii, July, 1912. It may perhaps
interest you to know that I have obtained an agency for live fancy
Pheasants, which I obtain from France. I can supply fifteen
different species, including three of Tragopans, and am receiving
orders at the present time and for eggs in the spring.
I should be very glad should you know of anyone interested in
these splendid birds, if you would kindly mention my name to them.
In regard to the Amherst plate, would you please let me have
address of publisher if you cannot supply the picture yourself.
Thanking you in anticipation, and trusting I may hear from you
soon.
Yours truly,
Charles B. Horsbrugh.

Co. Down, Ireland.
[Members having spare copies of the plate desired are requested
to communicate directly with our correspondent.--G. R.]
The Council deeply regrets to report that closely
following the death of our esteemed Secretary, Miss
Alderson, we have now lost our President, Lord Sherborne.
Known to most of us as the lion, and Rev. Canon Dutton,
his avicultural work is most familiar to the older
generation of naturalists, who will deeply deplore that he
did not live to long enjoy his title.

THE CRY OF OWLS

<bodyText confidence="0.9902808" page_id="10098960"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
I am not aware of any explanation of the weird, startling cries
uttered by Owls, and I have often wondered what use they could be
to the birds. I have lately thought of a reason for the cry, and hope
that some of the readers of the Avicultural Magazine who have kept
Owls will be able to record some fact that settles my idea--for or against
--or, better still, devise an experiment with an Owl to test it. I know
the great difficulty of devising and recording an experiment of this
nature, but to me it is in such endeavours to clear up doubtful questions
of this nature that the chief value of aviculture consists. I have never
kept Owls, and am quite prepared to hear, on the principle of " nothing
new under the sun ", that my idea is ancient history ; but my excuse
for troubling is that it has occurred independently to me.
Birds have various notes to express alarm, etc., and these notes
are mostly pleasing and harmonious, some of the love-songs very much
so. Why should Owls utter such raucous, startling cries ? It would
appear to be a great mistake for a bird that catches its prey by night
to let the prey know that it is about, searching for a victim ; but the
notes of all birds have a meaning and a use, and 1 have no doubt the
Owl's cry helps it to catch its food, or Owls would have starved long ago.
In Monmouthshire there are five Owls. The Short-eared species.

A. G. Butler--Colour in Feathers
I think, is a regular winter visitor on suitable ground. The Long-eared
Owl is rare ; the Little Owl has invaded the county during the last
two years, and is spreading. None of these three are numerous enough
to discuss. The Brown Owl is very common, and the Barn Owl fairly
so. The former has two calls, the most startling being something like
" Tch-vac ! Tch-vac ! " pronounced with great sharpness.
This, however, is nothing to the call of the Barn Owl, or as many
country people call it, the Screech Owl, and those who have heard it
suddenly give vent to its cry in the darkness might well imagine that
it would send every Rat or Mouse within hearing to its hole for the rest
of the night. The cry of the Eagle Owl is said to be very much worse,
and yet it must serve some purpose in the economy of the bird. It is
well known that most animals in all classes escape their enemies by
" freezing "--i.e. becoming absolutely rigid until the danger has passed.
Assume an Owl conscious of the presence of prey by (possibly) scent or
sight, and the animal lost to sight by the rigid attitude it has assumed.
If an Owl after flying around and failing to discover the position of
the animal suddenly lets fly its startling cry, it might well cause that
animal, especially if young, to start, and that movement would disclose
its position and mean capture, if so, these cries, which to us appear
to give alarm to the hunted, would really be of great assistance to
Owls.
This, of course, is only a theory, and should be supported by facts
before it can be accepted as an explanation of such weird and apparently
harmful cries.
Do those who keep Owls notice that they take their prey mostly
after uttering their cries ?

rid of in order to leave the yellow pigment unaffected ? It is easier
to comprehend change of colour in the case of pigments than in the
structure of every feather in a bird's plumage.
In floriculture one notes that individuals of the same flower exhibit
utterly dissimilar colouring in their blooms, probably absorbing from
the same soil different chemicals or varying quantities of the same
mineral colouring agent; but 1 should not expect the surface, say,
of a rich blue pansy to differ structurally from that of a golden-yellow
one ; indeed, we know well that in the case of these flowers the colouring
is not evidently pigmental or structural (in the accepted sense of the
term) since it is a fluid and permanent--perhaps representing pigment
in solution or infinitely small floating structures capable of intercepting
special light-rays ; it is not affected by the moulding of the outer
walls of the flower.
In insects blue pigment certainly does occur, unless I am greatly
mistaken, since we constantly see patches of dead blue in all shades
near to areas of black or brown structurally modified so as to exhibit
shot-blue colouring. Then when one transfers the scales of a butterfly's
wing to gummed paper, thus reversing the scales, although one may
note prismatic effects upon the back of the scale which do not appear
on the front, the actual colour of the scale is retained, indicating the
presence of enclosed pigment.
The whole question of colour in nature is very interesting and
extremely complex ; one life is not long enough to enable one to get
to the bottom of a thousandth part of nature's puzzles.

Birds which live long in captivity are of interest because they give
an idea of the length of life in the wild state, if fortunate enough to
escape destruction by enemies. It seems, therefore, worth recording
that of two specimens of birds of prey, Forster's Milvago or Carrion
Hawk (Ihycter australis ) -- a species native to the Falkland Islands --
which arrived in the London Zoological Gardens in July, 1886, both

Frederick D. Welch -- Forster&apos;s Milvago
lived for more than thirty-one years, the first dying towards the end
of 1917, the other being still alive in June, 1919 (since then I have not
visited the Gardens). It would seem, judging from this long career,
that London fogs have no bad effect on the health of this species.
Whether they were male and female I cannot say for certain, but
am inclined to think they were, because one warm day in 1902 I found
them running round in a circle on the floor of their cage, each following
in the path of the other, and both uttering a loud cackling noise, much
like that of a broody domestic hen, but much louder. This display
seemed to be an outburst of breeding affection ; they continued it
for about three minutes, but stopped at once when they discovered
that they were watched. I was never fortunate enough to see them
again indulge in this amusing conduct, they having apparently become
suspicious.
If they were, as I believe, male and female, there was no appreciable
difference in the size of the sexes. Both birds were about as big as a
common Buzzard, and of the same coloration--black in general, with
a white tip to the tail. There were brown feathers round the thighs,
and some pale-grey* streaks down the neck and breast. Neither bird
showed any alteration in the paler marks as age advanced, thus con-
trasting with some Vulturine Eagles (Aquila verrauxi) exhibited at
intervals in the same Gardens, one of which darkened somewhat, no
doubt owing to advancing age.
As negative evidence is sometimes of value, it may be stated here
that Mr. C. Chubb, of the British Museum, very kindly examined three
specimens for me during 1919, but without settling whether the female
bird was usually the larger.
A striking feature of these Milvagoes during their earlier years--
and especially from about 1900 to 1908--was their aggressive temper
towards other birds in adjoining cages. For instance, on one occasion
I found both very hostile to a recently arrived Tawny Eagle ; the
Milvagoes dashing at the bars shrieking wildly and vociferously, witp
* In the Royal Natural History these streaks are stated to be " white ".
They were grey in the above specimens from 1900 and onwards, as also in
another specimen seen in Belle Vue Gardens, Manchester, about 1902, which
agreed in size also with the two in London.

much flapping of wings, evidently eager for battle with the newcomer
if an opportunity occurred. As the Eagle only stared back angrily,
nothing further developed ; the display lasted an hour. On another
occasion 1 found them trying to reach a Crowned Hawk Eagle (Spizcetus
coronatus), so that Forster's Milvago is not deficient in courage. In
later life they became much milder. Except when angry, I never
remember them making any noise none for amusement, as is so
frequent with the vociferous Sea Eagle, and to a lesser extent with
Pallas's Fishing Eagle.
The only other comparison which seems worth noting is that these
birds appeared heavier and less active in flight than were their allies,
the Brazilian Caracaras ( Polyboms ).

There is probably no other zoological park in the world that
possesses the acreage, associated with the wide variations of topo-
graphical features of the National Zoological Park at Washington.
With respect to the first it may be said that the land area includes
between 160 and 170 acres, w r hile, taken as a whole, the land and
water diversity is truly remarkable, as one finds every physical character
of it in the surrounding country for miles. There are level tracts,
gorges, forests, thickets, hills of no mean size, goodly streams, ponds,
brooks--indeed, so diversified is the area that the visitor ever has
the feeling of being very close to nature when rambling through the
greater part of the reserve. It is not my intention, however, to present
a detailed description of this elegant Government reservation in this
place, as I have already done so in several other publications, as in
the Scientific American supplement and elsewdiere. It is from an
ornithological angle that I desire to give some account of the attractions
of our National " Zoo ", and there are many of them.

44 R. W. Shufeldt--Birds in Washington Zoological Gardens
First a word as to the wild birds that regularly occur every yearly
migration in this extensive domain--some of which nest there and rear
their young. Most of these fall in with the passerine groups, as the
Thrushes, Warblers, and Bluebirds, not to mention a considerable
list of others. As I write these lines I have just returned from the
" Zoo ", where I have been photographing, out in the timbered part,
a captive Opossum. As I made the second exposure a wild Turkey
flew down and lit in the snow within 50 feet of my camera. The elegant
bird was quite oblivious of our presence--there being three of us, my
wife, a park attendant, and myself. Bevies of Quail are frequent
visitors, and occasionally a Woodcock may be flushed in the swampy
places. Crows, Vultures, Woodpeckers, Jays, Wild-fowl, Herons,
Waders--in fact, all birds of the immediate region--are to be found
in this park at one time or another. Some of these are attracted by
those of the corresponding species confined in cages that have been
erected in more or less secluded places among the trees. There you will
see a wild Barred Owl in the evening, sitting outside on top of the big
cage in which are confined some six or seven of its own species. There
are a number of Night Herons in the great flying cage ; so we find in
the evening wild birds of the same species, to the number of five or
six (eleven in one instance), alighting on the trees in the vicinity, or on
top of the cage. In numerous instances they have built their nests
and reared their young in the latter place.*
In addition to Night Herons the flying cage contains Florida
Cormorants, various Gulls, Australian Swans, Great Blue Herons,
several species of Ibis, Anhingas, Pelicans, and other water-fowl. There
is a good-sized pond in the centre, a spring near by, and a large tree
for the Cormorants and Herons to nest in.
Close to this great cage is another of no mean proportions, in which we
may see as fine a collection of Cockatoos and other Psittacidse as exists
in any zoological garden in the world. There are two or three species
of Macaws with them, some five or six of each kind, with numerous
specimens of the Sulphur-crested and Leadbeater's Cockatoos. Along
the same path we come to a little pool on which one may see some twenty

or thirty Ducks and Teals in superb plumage, the species represented
being the Mandarin Teal, three species of American Teal, and Wood
Ducks. On a side hill, not far off, large cages contain the California
Condors, various rare Hawks, and Vultures. Their quarters are large
and commodious, and the various inmates are in fine condition. In
another part of the park one will find a superb specimen of the South
American Condor, while close at hand another immense cage contains
numerous species of Eagles, Vultures, and their allies. Outside, on
the top of this cage, it is no unusual thing to see a dozen Turkey
Buzzards perching, some of them roosting there all night. They are
attracted by the raw beef fed to the captives in the cage.
Of all the Raptorial birds in the park the great favourite was the
late famous Harpy Eagle, of which I obtained a photograph through
the courtesy of Mr. N. Hollister, the Superintendent, who kindly
allowed me to make prints from the negative in the park collection.
" The record for this Harpy Eagle is a matter of pride for the keepers
in the bird department, for this rare bird of prey had been kept in good
health for nearly eighteen years. He was received May 19, 1899, as
a gift from the Governor of the State of Amazonas, Brazil, through
Commander C. C. Todd, United States Navy. It is believed that the
species has never before been kept in any gardens for a similar period."
After its demise the specimen passed to the National Museum, and apart
from its skull, which was left in the skin, I have compared the skeleton
of this bird with that of the big Monkey-eating Eagle of the Philippines.
The account has recently been published by the Bureau of Science in
Manila.
In various cages in the main bird house we find a very excellent
collection of a great variety of species, some of which are rarely seen
in captivity. During the year 1918 there were in the collection, all
told, over 700 individuals, representing a great many species. At
the further end of the bird house there is a great cage, in the centre of
which a fine pool of clear water is placed. There we see Storks, Ibises,
Tree Ducks, Pelicans, Flamingoes, and other aquatic species. Just
outside another large cage is seen to contain some five or six specimens
of the famous Kea Parrot. These were received from the New Zealand
Government through Mr. Ben Wilson, of the Department of Tourist

Wekas, or flightless Rails.
In so far as birds go, one of the greatest attractions of this park is
its Wild-fowl lake (Fig. 1), where we find associated some forty species
of anserine birds, as Swans, various kinds of Geese, Brant, Teals,
Sheldrakes, Ducks, and Pochards ; at any season of the year the sight
is surely a very unusual one. Every year some of these birds breed
along the margin of the lake and rear their young. During summer
afternoons one of the great attractions of the place is to be on hand
when this assemblage of wild-fowl are fed. It is certainly an interesting
thing to see so many species together in one flock.
The members of the bird department of this " Zoo " have every
reason to be proud of the record they have earned for the means adopted
for displaying this collection to the visiting public ; for the attractive
arrangement of the habitations of the various species; and for the care
bestowed upon them. What is needed, in so far as my information
carries me, is better salaries for all those connected with the institution,
a far more generous appropriation from Congress each year for the
upkeep of the entire concern, and, finally, complete prosectorial and
photographic departments, where birds and their structure could be
s tudied as they should be studied.

By the late 0. E. Cresswell
(Kindly communicated by Miss Frances Cresswell.)
The three points to which I would call attention as regards Parrots
are : (a) their wonderful power of imitating the human voice, the
voices of animals and birds, and domestic sounds; (b) their fascinating
tameability and affection ; ( c ) the glorious beauty and variety of their
forms and plumage.
(a) Of their Imitative Powers .--This power, as we all know, is
possessed by very few tribes of birds. The Raven, the Crow, the
Jackdaw, the Jay, and Magpie, among British birds, occasionally
possess and exercise it, and I must confess that I have known a quaint

comicality in the mimicry of Jackdaws and Magpies scarcely equalled
by any Parrot. They, however, are rare exceptions. Of the Parrot
tribe there seems a possibility that a bird of any species, from the
huge Hyacinthine Macaw down to the tiniest Australian Budgerigar,
may speak, and of certain species a large majority of individuals do
learn to speak more or less. I say advisedly learn to speak, for their
proficiency as talkers depends greatly on the tact, patience, and
perseverance of their instructors. A Parrot will often remain silent
for months, occasionally for years, in new hands, and still eventually
- prove an excellent talker. I do not mean that they do not learn much
from one another and from the casual noises and conversations of a
family, while appearing to take no notice at all ; but whatever you
desire to teach a Parrot you must repeat constantly, and must not be
disheartened by the bird's utter disregard or rather apparent utter
disregard of you. Some day he will probably say it when least expected
to do so. I should not fail to mention that like great talkers of the
human race they are jealous of rivals, and, like a Macaulay or a
Thackeray, some Parrots if they cannot monopolize the conversation
often sulk in silence. My own Patagonian Conure has terribly retro-
graded since my Illiger's Macaw learnt his pet sayings and says them
first ! This is a common complaint with those who keep many Parrots.
I do not for a moment believe that because they are silent they forget
their former sayings ; I believe the memory of Parrots to be very
accurate. The said Patagonian Conure at times calls the poultry in
the peculiar way of a young man who was temporarily with me
in 1893.
You may perhaps ask, " Which of all the Psittacidse are the best
talkers ? " Probably the well-known Grey South African, but though
they have great facility for learning a number of words and even
sentences and pronouncing them intelligently, they almost invariably
do so in their own rather throaty voice.
South American Amazons, of which I will speak in detail presently,
are close rivals of the Greys, and they have an advantage in that they
are far more easily acclimatized. A friend of mine, probably the greatest
living English authority on Parrots, the Hon. and Rev. Frederick Dutton,
wrote : " The Amazon is one of the best to keep, as it learns quickly

The late 0. E. Cresswell -- Parrots
to talk, and when it becomes a good talker gives up screaming. I
find them a better-tempered Parrot than the Grey. They are more
apt at imitating sound than the Grey Parrot. The Grey does not
pick up laughing, crying, and such like sounds as the Amazon does.
The Amazon, too, has the special power of giving the idea of a con-
versation. You hear no word distinctly, but you would certainly say
two people were talking together. An Amazon, too, talks much more
freely before strangers than a Grey, and certainly one that really talks
rubbish is to be preferred to a Grey for that reason."
The Macaws alone, I believe, of the tribe (save most occasionally
and exceptionally) have the power of changing their voices. My own
Illiger's Macaw, which I hope presently to introduce to you, can call
his name " Jerry in a clear loud voice, and then will whisper it in
the softest and most affected tones. So much for the speaking and
imitative powers of Parrots -- but with which function of the brain
is this connected ? I fancy chiefly with association of ideas. I
remember long years ago, when I was in the University of Oxford,
reading a paper before an essay society upon the great part which
association of ideas has among our own intellectual faculties. I was
forcibly and interestingly reminded of my former study by Miss Lech-
mere's instructive paper on the mental faculties of the lower animals.
With Parrots I am certain that association is powerful and accurate-
I will give two or three instances. My own Patagonian Conure some
years ago lived in the old cottage ; the stove had a valve which
squeaked abominably when opened ; the bird soon learned to imitate
this metallic noise exactly, and if he saw one approaching the stove
to put on fuel, squeaked before one had time to raise the valve. As
an instance of great accuracy of association, viz. association of a saying
with a time of play, 1 may relate the case of a Grey Parrot, the most
wonderful talker I have ever heard of, the property of a lady and gentle-
man in Devonshire, which says " good morning " with the clearest
utterance, but never save in the earlier hours of the day. One more
instance from my own experience. I was last autumn in the extreme
south-west of France, where Amazon Parrots from Brazil are every-
where seen. Outside a cottage, the inhabitants of which had apparently
gone out to work for the day and had locked it up, hung a poor Parrot

Of all my experiences in France during the War, some pleasant,
others the reverse, 1 think none gave me more delight than the
occasional hours spent watching and listening to birds. At the present
time bird-watching has become almost a cult; but listening to birds is
equally interesting and rewarding, and the bird 1 have particularly
in my mind appeals more to the ear than to the eye.
Early one morning in the month of May, 1916, while asleep in the
garden of a chateau at a village called Hersin Coupigny, I was awakened
by a bird's note that was new to me. For awhile I was unable to detect
what bird it was, high up among the thick foliage over my head, that
made such a surprising medley of sounds ; but presently J was able
to make out a small green Warbler, somewhat in size, form, and posture
like a Wood Warbler, but with a greenish belly and a pronounced eye-
streak.
Its song was remarkable, being a kind of pot-pourri of sounds,
some sweet, some the exact imitation of the notes and songs of other
birds, all mixed up with harsh guttural noises.
This active and garrulous little bird proved to be the IcterineWarbler
(Iltjpolais icterina), a bird I was soon to become very familiar with and
very fond of. At first it imitated the song of the Swallow, which it did
so perfectly that for a while I could not believe that a Swallow was not
twittering somewhere close by. Besides the song, this bird mimicked
the cry of the Swallow, and also the alarm-note of the Blackbird ; but
the latter was reproduced in miniature. This particular Ieterine also
gave really remarkable imitations of the Skylark's song and of some of
the notes of the Nightingale, while it mimicked several times the long
drawn out whistle of the Starling.

This bird proved to be by far the finest p&gt;erformer 1 ever heard, as
although 1 afterwards listened to many Icterine Warblers during the
summer of 191G I heard none to compare with the first one.
By June 8 Icterines were becoming quite numerous, and on this
day I witnessed a most furious battle between one and a cock Black-
cap Warbler.
On May 18 I came across a very fluent Icterine in the little mining
town called Fosse No. 10, which was the last place in which one
would expect to see or hear anything so charming, as it was a squalid
excrescence of brick and mortar occasionally under shell-fire.
This one mimicked most accurately the call notes of the Green
and Greater-spotted Woodpeckers, but in miniature. I thought
up to this time that all these calls were imitating other birds&apos; notes,
but this Fosse 10 bird also reproduced exactly the note of the so-called
Pekin Robin (Liothrix luleus ) -- so that in some cases the similarity
of sound must be a mere coincidence.
This dreadful town of Fosse 10 appeared to only have this one
bird inhabitant, which lived amongst some lilac bushes in the little
back-yard of the deserted cottage where I was billeted.
On May 28 I found the first nest, a dainty, compact affair covered
with pieces of lichen and held in the fork of a shrub ; in it were five
eggs of a delicate purple-lilac colour, with small dark-brown spots.
Whenever I approached the nest the bird that 1 think was the hen
kept up a continual series of alarm cries, resembling the chirp of a
House Sparrow. Icterine Warblers seem to be attracted to towns,
as I saw and heard another in the large mining town of Bruay, where no
other Warblers were to be seen; in fact, no birds at all, except Sparrows
and Starlings, and occasionally a Black Redstart, which last has an
affection for roofs of houses.
Below the town of Poperinghe there is a stream with steep banks on
either side, and much hidden by shrubs and small trees, which runs
towards Abele. This was a great haunt of Icterine Warblers ; some
good mimics, some very poor. Here one noticed the great apparent
change in colour of the breast of these birds, varying from light brown
to bright green, the latter caused by the light being reflected off the
leaves of the bushes in which the birds were perching for the moment.

" The country now presented the aspect of a vast zoological garden."
So wrote Sir Cornwallis Harris on his famous African journey long ago,
and though the" bonny mountains of Cashan" no longer harbour swarms
of White Rhinoceroses and troops of Sable Antelope in the Gardens
at Pretoria the naturalist may yet make intimate acquaintance with
the fauna of a sub-continent. Those who have not wandered so far
afield may gain an excellent idea of the collection through the
illustrated Guide Book, printed in English and Dutch, a copy of which
has been sent us by Mr. Haagner, a member of our Society and Director
of the institution. Between 1,600 and 1,700 vertebrates are usually
kept, enjoying a lovely climate which renders elaborate heated buildings
all but superfluous, most of the animals being actual natives of the
country in which they are exhibited. The main entrance gives
immediate access to a grand avenue of silver oaks.
The aviculturist will find here much to interest him. Parrots swing
in semi-liberty under the silver oaks, recalling their relations of Regent&apos;s
Park under the trees of the canal bank. The Pheasantry, 175 yards
long, contains the Golden, Silver, Reeves, Amherst, Swinhoe, and
Ring-necked species, besides Crowned, Bleeding Heart, Crested, and
Wonga Wonga Pigeons ; Bustards and Francolin are also shown in
this series. The great flying aviary is 135 feet long, and contains
Peafowl and Guinea-fowl, Ibises and Coots, while in the trees over-
head are seen Touracoes, Parrots, Glossy Starlings, and Doves. The
Brush Turkey, of mound-building fame, is also represented.
The Carinate birds are represented by North and South African
Ostriches (including an albino female and an Emu) ; the larger water-
fowl are located near an avenue of gum-trees, and include the
Madagascar Knob-billed Goose, the Egyptian Goose, the Spur-winged
Goose, and domestic Ducks. The lesser water-fowl -- Carolina, Mandarin,
White-faced and Whistling Ducks, Japanese Teal, Magpie Geese, etc.
-- are installed in small paddocks in another part of the grounds, while
Swans and Flamingoes are accommodated in a large pond, the oldest
installation in the Gardens. The Indian Bar-headed Geese have lived

here ever since 1906. The series of Hornbills is fine, consisting of the
Ground Hornbill (the " Turkey " of the colonists), the Trumpeter
Hornbill, witli his great helmet, also the Grey, Red-billed, and Yellow-
billed species, these latter having been imported straight from the
local bushveld.
The birds of prey are housed in eighteen roomy cages. The inmates
include the Condor, the Black-eared Vulture, Kolbe's Vulture or
Aasvogel, the Egyptian Vulture, the Caracara, the Verreaux, Tawny,
and Bateleur Eagles. Here also are the Jackal Buzzard (often to be
seen at Regent's Park), the Steppe Buzzard, the Spotted and Grass
Owls. The large bird house is a shed devoted to Storks, Cranes, Peafowl,
etc. ; some domestic poultry are also shown here.
With regard to the buildings, the keynote throughout is simplicity
with efficiency, and the visitor from Europe will not find at Pretoria
elaborate edifices with heating apparatus and glass bricks; this
austral Zoo has gone " back to nature ", and every aviculturist will
wish it well.

HINTS FOR AVICULTURISTS: THE PRESERVA-
TION OF EGGS

Clutches .--The contents of a nest is termed a " clutch " , and is
at best the full number of eggs laid by the bird. Some birds (e.g.
Puffin, Razorbill, Storm Petrel) lay but one, and then one is the clutch ;
others, such as Pigeons, Nightjars, etc., lay only two, and then two
is the clutch. Eggs from one nest should never be mixed with those
from any other, and should be marked in such a wav that each clutch
can be distinguished. Experienced collectors can always tell if eggs
have been mixed, and a collector once found out in this is never trusted
again.
Marking Eggs.- --Keep clutches quite separate until they are blown,
and when they are blown and are quite dry mark thepi with a soft
pencil. Never mark them with ink or with indelible pencil. Employ
whatever system of marking you fancy, but the best is as follows :
Take a notebook or exercise book and record in it all vour clutches

as found, giving a number to each clutch and mark that number on each
egg in that clutch. The book will contain all the necessary information,
where found, date, and a few notes about the nest, whether eggs are
fresh or sat upon, and anything else worth recording. In some
countries, such as India and America, collectors work to a standard
reference list, and mark the recognized reference number on their eggs
as well as their own number.
Data. --Any neat scraps of paper will do for data slips, but a printed
form looks best, of course. Data slips should give the same information
that is recorded in the book, viz. name, date, locality, where found,
etc. etc., and, of course, the clutch reference number as marked on
the eggs.
Blowing Eggs. --Use only a conical drill and only make one hole,
and that on the side of the egg where the markings are least beautiful.
Wet the drill before starting, hold the egg in the fingers of the left hand,
and with the drill in the fingers of the right hand twirl the drill until
a hole is made sufficiently large for the contents to come out. Always
do this over a pan of water, as the egg if it drops is not so.likely to break.
Having bored the hole put the blow-pipe to the mouth, and with the
egg held hole downwards over the water blow air at the hole. It will
force its way in, form a cushion behind the yolk and force out the con-
tents. If the yolk-sac does not break, but comes out whole, thei&apos;e will
be no need to cleanse the egg, but if the yolk-sac breaks the egg must
be rinsed out by injecting water with the blow-pipe and blowing it
out till the inside is quite clean. After the egg is blown, lay it hole down
on a wet piece of old white cloth. Any dregs will run out, the surface
attraction of the wet cloth helping in this. Do not let them dry and stick
to the cloth, or portions of the shell will adhere to the cloth when you
lift the eggs up. All these little details are important, and make the
difference between good and badly prepared specimens. Clean outside
of eggs as far as you can, but remember the markings will wash off
some.
Packing. ---To pack eggs get a strong wooden box from a store.
Line it with cotton-wool, and tear strips of cotton-wool and wind each
egg round and round. The great things to remember are (1) to pack
the eggs so that they cannot rattle loose and touch each other or the

sides of the box, (2) do not pack so tight that the packing will not
" take up " the strains caused by the sides or lid bending in, (3) do not
try and use too light a box, or too small a box, or try to economize
with wool. If you do it will be the best eggs that will get broken, and
a saving of a few pence will be nothing in comparison.
OUR HON. TREASURER
Mr. Ezra has resigned the post of Honorary Treasurer to the
Society, the resignation taking effect as from January 22. At the
Council meeting held on that day the Council expressed their keen
appreciation of Mr. Ezra's valuable services, especially during the
dark days of the War. It is only the few who realize the amount of
correspondence which passes through the Treasurer's hands in the course
of twelve months.
Dr. Lovell-Keays, Secretary to the Society, was elected to the
vacant office. This appointment accords with the new policy of the
Council, which seeks to concentrate executive work into a smaller focus.

A Rescued Blue-tit. -- Early in the evening of October 29, 1916,
I noticed in the garden a Blue-tit, which was busily inspecting the
celery. It could hardly fly, mainly progressing by hops, as its plumage
was soaked and heavy. I easily captured it, and taking it inside
wrapped it in flannel and placed it in a basket near the fire. In the
morning it had quite recovered, and, the lid of the basket being lifted,
flew into an apple-tree and began to inspect the branches. I wish to
express my thanks to Dr. Butler for his paper on Budgerigars in the
December number in answer to my query.-- Eric Lee.

Eagle and Sparrow. -- Probably most visitors to the London
Zoological Gardens suppose that captive Eagles frequently dash after
the Sparrows which venture into their cages. My experience of
numerous visits has shown the opposite, as although several Eagles of
different genera and species have been seen to "eye" a Sparrow for a few
seconds, the only one I ever saw dash at one was a Corean Sea Eagle.
One day during August, 1901, when approaching the cage, I noticed
the eye of the Eagle light up as it gazed for a few seconds at a Sparrow,
which was sitting on the floor of the cage and between the upright bars
(with its body, therefore, half inside and half outside the cage). The
Eagle was on the perch, and without making any cry or screech its
wings were suddenly raised above its head (almost, if not quite, meeting
each other), and it dashed like lightning at the bars, crashing against
them with its legs, which were extended fully, and getting its toes
round the Sparrow before the latter had realized the situation and
made any attempt to escape. The Eagle*however, though its claws
were encircling its prey, could not close them completely , because the
bars were one on each side of the Sparrow, which finally managed to
wriggle out and escape. When the Eagle found its prey had escaped
it grasped the bars for several minutes and sat there flapping its wings,
screeching now and then. Like certain mammals which are only
black and white, the contrast of colours in this Eagle, which was all
black except for the white tail and beak, rendered it more attractive
than some birds, which have several and more gaudy hues. Whether
other Eagles can pounce so quickly as this one J cannot say, having no
means of comparison, but from the extraordinary rapidity of this
individual I cannot believe that any other species could move faster. --

reader to the open life of moor and covert, whether asleep in the blazing
sunshine or cold and dank under winter's coverlet. In addition to the
exquisite Nature scenes we also find detailed studies of individual
birds, and even of individual talons and feet, all sketched with almost
microscopic accuracy. Eagles, Hawks, Owls, Pheasants, and
Ptarmigan may be mentioned among Mr. Thorburn's sitters ; then
there are beautiful studies of Titmice, of Thrushes, and of Ducks.
Mr. Thorburn's art has that most valuable quality-- the power to
suggest movement. The Golden Eagle wafted on strong pinions,
its great wings curled upward by the wind, is an instance of this ;
repose, on the other hand, is seen in the Pheasant at the covertside,
with brilliant plumage set off by the blazing autumn woodland. The
Woodcock lying in concealment recalls Mr. Proctor Smith's photograph
of a resting Snipe, which appeared in our November number ; the Barn
Owl, with its cat-like face, the handsome Fieldfare, the smart Redwing,
and the lustrous Black Cock, busy courting, pass before us in pro-
cession. Anatomists will appreciate the detail in the figured Eagle
talons, with their suggestion of savage strength.
The sketches, are not however, of equal value ; thus the leg of the
Great Tit on plate 20 is too feeble ; and a Sea Eagle is shown feeding
with dripping beak on a Rabbit carcase, which exhibits no visible
damage.

autumn, asking if any members would like me to be on the look-out

the birds in the North Island.
I mentioned that a lot of game birds had been sent out just before
the War by a friend of mine in Copenhagen, and you asked me to
inquire particulars. I wrote my friend a good many weeks ago, but
have had no reply, so what has happened to him I cannot say. The game
birds were Capercailzie, Willow Grouse, and Black Cock, and although

Birds of the British Islands, by T. A. Coward (an excellent little book
illustrated by plates copied from Lilford's Birds), for my younger son,
and upon looking through it yesterday in the article on the Barn Owl
(Flammed flammea), p. 290, I find : --
" During its nightly rounds, for it has regular beats, it
screeches repeatedly, a habit calculated to discount the
advantage gained by its silent flight. The suggestion that
small mammals are startled into movement is hardly supported
by experience, for the alarmed Mouse or Shrew instantly
&apos; freezes ' and is then difficult to detect."
You will notice that this does not cover my suggestion that the
screech is to startle its prey from the frozen attitude, and that the
matter is only to be solved by the observation of tame Owls by
aviculturists. It would be interesting to know from where Mr. Coward
got his reference to this suggestion, and also what " experience ", if
any, he has had.
I thought it better to bring this to your notice, as I should be
sorry to be the cause of your starting a discussion in your paper that
has already been worked out in other journals.

Sip.,-- 1 cannot agree with Mr. Banks that the Owls, as a rule, utter
" raucous " cries, but I suppose that is a matter of taste. I have seen
no evidence to support the idea that the calls are connected with the
capture of prey, any more than that the songs of Passerine birds, the
screams of Hawks, and the various notes of Gulls or Ducks have influence
upon the animals on which they feed. I have kep&gt;t both Barn and
Tawny Owls, and though both called frequently, the notes had no
relation to feeding time. There was often a chirrup of satisfaction on
receipt of food, but no distant screech or hoot, or even the flight call,
ki-wik, which is common to both species.

This Park is comparatively new, as the laying out only began in
April, 1913 ; it was opened to the public in the following July. Com-
prising about 74 acres, it is situated about three miles out of Edinburgh
on the southern slope of Corstorphine Hill. The site is beautiful, and
a glorious view can be obtained from it, with the picturesque Pentland
Hills in the distance. *
The following notes were made on a dull, cold February day :--
The first enclosure observed was large and open, with a suitable
pond and bushes ; it contained Widgeon, Gadwall, and Wild and
Muscovy Ducks, all of which were strolling about on land, with the
exception of the Ducks, which were thoroughly enjoying a bath in spite
of the coldness of the water.
The next enclosure was also large, and contained Bean, White-
fronted, Hybrid, Pink-footed, Grey-lag, Cereopsis, Upland, Brent,
Canadian and Chinese Geese, and Hybrid and Tufted Ducks. Here the
Ducks were again busy, dipping and diving for food from the bottom
of the pond. All the birds appeared to be very contented and in
excellent condition. Several were sleeping comfortably on the banks,
standing on one leg, with their heads well tucked into the plumage

of their backs. Cormorants and Solan Geese shared the next enclosure
with a Californian Sea-lion. The birds were standing idly on a rocky
shelf, taking no interest whatever in the graceful movements of the
Sea-lion as it swam round and round the pond. They were probably
patiently waiting for feeding time, for which they are always ready.
A still larger, grassy enclosure contained a pair of Emus, who did not
appear to be very sociably inclined ; one paraded backwards and
forwards at the nearer end of the enclosure, while the other took its
constitutional at the further limit, with an occasional trip to the railings
to gaze at the visitors, probably hoping for some gastronomic delicacy
to be offered. The inhabitants of the next enclosure were numerous
and varied, and consisted of Black-headed Gulls, White Cranes, Pelicans,
Oyster Catchers, Great Skuas, White Storks, Demoiselle Cranes, and
Herons. They had a fine home, with grassy floor and bushes and a small
pond, and although of such diverse breeds, appear to live in absolute
harmony. A small wooden hut, for shelter from extreme weather,
is provided, but rarely used. The Pelicans appeared to be suffering
from some mild form of irritation on their backs, and were busily
scratching with the tips of their long beaks. The most graceful birds
in this enclosure were undoubtedly the Demoiselle Cranes, with their
delicate grey plumage looking beautifully smooth and clean.
Two large flight aviaries and several smaller ones have been erected
in a garden sheltered by high walls. In summer this garden is filled
with brightly coloured flowers, and its general appearance is charming.
Both flights were well provided with shelter at one end, small tree-
trunks with bare branches for the small inhabitants to perch on, and
butter-tubs with small entrance-holes hung from the roofs, and which
made excellent nesting-places. In one aviary were found the Grey-
headed and Black-faced Lovebirds, Budgerigar, and Cockatiel; in
the other were Blue and Yellow-fronted Amazon Parrots, Rose-breasted,
Leadbeaters, Greater Sulphur-crested and Goffin's Cockatoos, and
Blue and Yellow, Red and Yellow, and Red and Blue Macaws--these
birds make a beautiful colour show. T was here greeted by a Cockatoo,
clinging to the front netting, with a hearty " Hullo, Cocky ! " and an
jnvitation to scratch its poll. This I did, discreetly, with the end of
my pencil, much, apparently, to the bird's enjoyment. When I stopped

it rubbed its head in a wise, old-fashioned way against the netting,
but refused to carry on a further conversation. These aviaries and
most of the others were used as restaurants by the ubiquitous Sparrows,
who were making hearty meals from the leavings of the legitimate
inhabitants. The tree-trunks and branches showed signs of many
hours of beak-sharpening, and in some cases the trunks were picked
away where they entered the ground, as if a Beaver had been at work.
Tn one of the smaller aviaries a Senegal Parrot and a Bauer's Parrot
were living amicably together, although coming from such far removed
countries (the former from West Africa and the latter from Australia).
They appeared to be very interested in the human onlookers, as they
spent their time running to the middle of the cage for a mouthful of
maize and back to the sides to talk to the visitors with their quaint
chattering little voices.
Another large aviary was the home of Rosella, Grey-breasted,
Pennant's, Red-necked and Alexandrine Parrakeets, and my approach
to this was the signal for a lusty and prolonged screeching by the
majority of the inmates. Here it was interesting to watch a Robin
Redbreast sharing a meal from a small dish of seed with a Red-necked
Parrakeet, and neither seemed to notice anything peculiar in the
appearance of the other or to object to its company. The old saying
that " little birds in their nests agree " can be truly modified, in the
case of this Zoo, to " all birds, great and small, in their aviaries agree".
A row of enclosures, constructed of wire-netting stretched on wooden
frames and planted with dwarf shrubs, came next. These enclosures
were all supplied with the Norwich Automatic Feeder and Exerciser,
which probably resulted in a large economy in food. In the first
enclosure an Australian Brush Turkey was sharing its meal with a
large Rat and two Thrushes, and here, again, as there was food for all,
neither took exception to the presence of the others.
Razor-billed Curassows occupied the next enclosure. One was
roosting in a small covered shelter, apparently asleep or deeply
thinking, and the remainder were strutting gaily around their
boundaries. Next door to these were living some Amherst Pheasants,
whose beautiful plumage was quite unaffected by the dirty weather.
Next came some Hybrid and Prince of Wales Pheasants, and then

Golden Pheasants, whose gorgeous colours made a delightful contrast
to the drab surroundings. Then came Silver Pheasants, with their
long, graceful tails unsoiled in spite of the muddy nature of the ground.
A Peacock and Peahen paraded proudly around these enclosures, the
cock with its train fully expanded as if to show the other birds what
a very superior creature it was.
Another large, open, grassy enclosure contained two Rheas, looking
somewhat bedraggled, but not worried at all by this, and busily dis-
posing of worms which had foolishly come to the surface. A small
enclosure, with pond and rocky banks, held some Moorhens and
Curlews, and just beyond stood the mansion-house of the estate, which
serves as a club for the Fellows of the Society, and as refreshment-
rooms for the general public.
Beyond this, again, the birds of prey are housed, the first being the
Griffin Vultures, who looked very alert and very ready and willing to
attack anything that might come within reach. A Golden Eagle was
the sole occupant of one cage, and the name appeared somewhat
inappropriate, as its colouring was a dingy black, with no apparent
sign of gold. Two Wedge-tailed Eagles were in the next compartment
sitting most affectionately together with a look of innocence and
harmlessness somewhat foreign to their real natures. Next door lived
a fine Raven, who on my arrival at once remarked, " What do you
want ? " and in spite of my explaining fully the reason of my visit,
still repeated the question.
Lastly, in a large enclosure, the floor of which consisted of shelving
rock, with growing clumps of coarse grass, forming an excellent back-
ground for the birds, were living a fine group of King Penguins and one
Black-footed Penguin. Some were received from South Georgia early
in 1914, and the others from the same place in February, 1917. These
are probably the most interesting birds in the Park to the general
public. The amount of food alone which they consume is both
interesting and surprising, the adults disposing of from twenty to
thirty moderate-sized Herrings in a day. They were standing in their
usual stolid, foolish-looking way, with the exception of a " baby "
bird, who took an occasional stroll round, at the same time emitting
a characteristic weird cry. The Black-footed Penguin looked distinctly

lonely, as the " Kings " did not seem to care to associate with it. The
baby, with its fine brown furry coating, was considerably plumper in
appearance than its parents, and most unlike them, with their snowy
breasts, grey backs, and beautiful orange collars.
There have been many births since the opening of the Park. Two
young Rheas were hatched out in 1914, but only one survived. Since
then a number of young have been bred. A considerable number of
Geese, Ducks, and Pheasants have been reared, and a pair of Tinamou
nested, but the eggs were not fertile. A pair of Moorhens have nested
twice and hatched--in all, eleven young. A pair of Cockatoos nested
twice, but on both occasions the eggs proved infertile. A number
of Pmdgerigars and one Black-faced Lovebird have been reared, and
also Californian Quail, Cockatiel, and hybrids between Gadwall and
Widgeon.
In 1918 a pair of King Penguins " nested ". (This term, although
not correct, is used for want of a better one. Penguins make no nest,
but the single egg is held, during incubation, upon the feet and covered
with a fold of down and feathers of the abdomen. Both sexes
share the task of incubation.) The egg was unfortunately broken,
probably while changing from one bird to another. On September 1
of last year another egg was laid, and on October 22, seven weeks and
four days after, the infant--the present " baby " bird--left the shell. It
is almost certain that this is the first time that the King Penguin has
bred outside its native haunts, and the occasion has afforded a unique
opportunity of observing the habits of these birds.

tion recorded--whether it be a learned research into the History of
Dogs, a dissertation on Sardines or Sea-lions, the breeding of Casso-
waries, or an enthusiastic support of the Polygonum saghalinense as
a fodder plant--is always couched in popular language. About
a century ago the practical zoologists of Great Britain split from the
parent Linnean Society, and a similar need for greater freedom and
a wider range has manifested itself in France, not by disruption of
the Society, but by division of its activities.
Henceforward the ornithologists, under the presidency of that
eminent naturalist M. Delacour, will deal in L&apos;Oiseau with everything
pertaining to avian life, and especially with birds in parks and cages.
A summary of the first number will best convey the scope of the under-
taking and the range of its intentions.
The best article is an extremely interesting and informative account
of Humming-birds in captivity by M. Delacour. M. G. Dupond
describes the troubles of aviculturists in Belgium during the War.
Mr. Seth-Smith, whose contribution is illustrated by a good photograph
of the Kagus' courtship, shows how the London Zoological Gardens
suffered in those days. The rearing of Demoiselle Cranes and hybrids
among Diamond Finches are also discussed, and we must specially
refer to the acute observations of Dr. Millet-Horsin on the seasonal
illnesses of birds in Senegal, and the means of prevention. The
arrivals of birds,, in France and other interesting information will
appear in each month's Ornithological Chronicle, and the advertise-
ments put members in the way of obtaining birds not always available

(Continued from p. 49.)
(b) The Tameability and Affection of Parrots. --This to some extent
goes without saying, but I must confess that their affection is usually
tempered both with caprice and jealousy. I know cases of Parrots
which adore human beings of the female sex and hate those of the other,
and vice versa. Dr. Russ, the great ornithologist of Berlin, advises
that when a Parrot arrives anybody w T ho wishes to enjoy its affection
should not unpack it, so lasting is often the bird's antipathy to the
person with whom it associates the discomfort of being dragged out of
a packing-case ! The jealousy of Parrots is proverbial. Several of my
own make conversation with friends impossible from mere jealousy.
My Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet &lt;! Duleep " often makes one realize
how appropriate was the saying of a gifted authoress to a lady of my
acquaintance who took to writing to her daily : " My dear, do learn to

love wisely and not too well! "
(c) As regards the exquisite beauty and variety of the plumage of
the Psittacidae, there can scarcely be two opinions. Of all the multitude

of species which I have seen either alive or stuffed I can only recall
three which I do not admire. They are the Black Vasa Parrot of
Madagascar, the great Black Goliath Cockatoo of New Guinea, and
the Kea or Mountain Parrot of New Zealand. This bird seems to be
the connecting-link between the Parrot and Vulture tribe . 1 A more
unpleasant sight than these Nestors at the Zoo continually riving at
lumps of raw meat I have seldom seen.
I pass to the second part of my paper, the geographical distribution
of the Psittacidae. I may preface this section with observing what you
probably all know--that there are no Parrots in Europe. I propose to
take in order the other four divisions of the globe, viz. the three great
continents, including in each the circumjacent islands, and fourthly
the vast island of Australia, which, with the islands grouped com-
paratively near it, we commonly call Australasia. I propose to give

The late 0. E. Cressivell--Parrots
a brief account of the most marked and interesting races of Parrots
which inhabit each. That this account must be very superficial you
will readily grant when I tell you that the number of recorded species
of the Psittacidae, according to the British Museum catalogue, is
now 496, and that the number of those which are more or less known
as cage birds is over 100. Though I have disclaimed all attempts to
affect the scientific in this paper, I hope that this grouping is in no way
unscientific, for with one or two very slight exceptions there is no
confusion of the races which inhabit the different continents, no over-
lapping of the areas of distribution.
I will at once state the exceptions which occur to me. Firstly,
many species of Cockatoos are found in the East Indies, others in
Australia and neighbouring islands. Secondly, in Africa there occur
some Ring-necked Green Parrakeets scarcely distinguishable from the
well-known Indian Ring-necked species. Such partial and rare excep-
tions strongly prove the general rule which I have laid down.
The cradle of human origin and civilization is also the continent
on which in all probability Parrots were brought into captivity, centuries
before they were taken in Africa, and at least 2,000 years before the
discovery of the New World. The first mention of tame Parrots I do
not pretend to state. It has sometimes been thought that the birds
which the ships of King Solomon brought from Tarshish, and which
our version of the Bible translates Peacocks, were really Parrots. There
is little doubt that Alexander the Great imported to Europe Parrots
which he found in captivity in the East. One of the Indian Ring-necked
Parrakeets is still called the Alexandrine--probably the race which he
brought back, and that race alone was known to the Greek and Roman
worlds for ages afterwards--the little Green Ring-necked Bengal
Parrakeet. But I am anticipating, and had better first give you a rough
list of the Asiatic genera. The part of Asia inhabited by them includes
most of Hindustan, Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, and the great islands
of the Oriental Archipelago.
Let me first say a word about a common misapprehension. It is
not unnaturally supposed that a Parrakeet is the diminutive of a Parrot.
This, in fact, is not so, for many Parrakeets are larger than some Parrots.
Parrakeets are long-tailed, Parrots short-tailed.

1. The Noble or Ring-necked Parrakeet.

Among the Ring-necked I may name--
1. The Great Alexandrine.
2. The Malacca.
3. The Rose Malabar, with some very fine tints of colour in addition
to the prevailing green of the genus.
4. The very common little Bengal Parrakeet, to which I have
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.99395425" page_id="10098996"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
already alluded as probably the first of the Psittacidae imported into
Europe.
My &quot;Duleep Singh" is a modest-looking little Parrakeet; still, the
varying shades of green are beautiful when looked into, as also is the
little red ring. They are jealously affectionate, and fearful screamers
in a wild state, but if they do learn to say something say it well and
usually cease to scream. It doubtless was on the death of one of them
that Ovid wrote his lovely elegy beginning: " Psittacus Eois
imitatrix ales ab Indis." Of this tribe is the sweet little Blossom-
head--which has local variations--the Indian cyanocephalus and the
Burmese rosa.
The second Asiatic family is that of the Lories proper. They are
a short-tailed race of the most gorgeous hues of brilliant crimson,
green, and purple. They are rarely talkers, but their fascinating and
funny ways and their easy confidence in their owners make them
charming pets. They are seldom, however, seen save in the collections
of Parrot fanciers, and this for good reason, for by nature they feed
on rich ripe fruit and on the honey of tropical flowers. Anything like
a diet of seed causes fits and death. It is possible by slow degrees to
accustom them to fare far other than their natural diet, and in such
a case a Lory, or still better a pair, are a delight to a true bird-lover.
Most beautiful birds are the Purple-capped Lory from the Moluccas ;
the Black-capped or tricoloured Lory ; the Ceram Lory, of the richest
crimson with brilliant green wings ; and the Blue-breasted Lory.

The third Asiatic family are a portion of the Cockatoo race. These
are rarely great talkers, but one of the Asiatic species, the great Salmon-
crested Cockatoo, often articulates with amazing distinctness. They
are nearly all intelligent. I may, perhaps, relate the evidence of this
that I had at Bordeaux last autumn. The other Asiatic species are
the large all-white Cockatoo of the Moluccas ; Coffin's Yellowish
Cockatoo from the Solomon Islands ; and the little Lemon-crested
Cockatoo from the Moluccas, a miniature of the great Australian
Lemon-crested.

In June, 1903, it was proposed by the Council that I should be
appointed Correspondence Secretary to the Society, my chief duty
being to answer questions asked by Members relating to the care and
feeding of birds in captivity, the identification of birds received from
description as far as possible, sex-differences, nesting habits, etc.

to have had any experience, that I might call upon other members of
the Council to reply&apos;to my correspondents.
I had already had some work of this kind, inasmuch as I had been
answering queries each week since 1892 in the pages of the Feathered
World and Canary and Cage-bird Life ; possibly it was for this reason
that I was chosen by the Society to undertake it. Answering questions,
however, was not the only work which I willingly undertook. In the
early days of the Society all the members of the Executive received
proofs of each number of the Magazine for correction, and these were
returned to the Editor for his consideration before he sent his final
revise to the printers. This plan naturally tended to delay publication,
as well as causing a certain amount of irritation, and was eventually
set aside ; but, as a check upon printer's errors, my willingness to con-
tinue to examine proofs was welcomed by the Editor, my fitness for
the work since the publication of my first zoological paper in 1865
being probably taken for granted.
To answer questions of various kinds one not only needs a certain
amount of practical experience, but also a fairly good library;
fortunately I had already acquired the latter, which I considered
necessary for a student not actually living in town and so in touch with
the libraries of the Linnean, Zoological, and other Societies. But even
the possession of many books will not always serve to enable one to
answer indefinite queries or partial descriptions of birds. Occasionally
I have been requested to give information upon matters which were
undoubtedly not ornithological. Some years ago a lady wrote to me,
saying that she had seen an answer of mine (she was not one of our
Members) respecting a Parrot which had plucked its breast bare of
feathers and made it sore, and I had suggested that possibly castor oil
rubbed on the breast might check the bad habit and would probably allay
the soreness. She said that her hair was growing very thin, and would
like to know if castor oil would strengthen it, or if I could recommend
some other hair-restorer, as she had tried several without any good
results ! I replied that hair-restorers were often recommended by
persons who were themselves perfectly bald, that I myself only used
hot water each morning, and that I had not observed any increase
in the tonsure which I had for some years past exhibited, nor had my
hair become noticeably greyer.

I once had a very peremptory letter from a hospital nurse, insisting
that I should tell her by return of post how to cure her Parrot of
feather-plucking. I replied that as she had not enclosed a stamp for
reply, and as I was in no way her debtor, I felt that I might reasonably
have ignored her communication ; the condition of her bird was
probably the result of incorrect feeding, and the habit once formed
was practically incurable. In answer to this I received a missive full
of coarse abuse; if it made the good lady happy, it did not trouble me.
Of course, it is not pleasant to have to remind correspondents that they
have omitted to enclose stamps, but even before the War pennies
mounted up in the course of a year, and I could not expect our Society
to pay for postage incurred through non-members seeing copies of our
Magazine.
Being Correspondence Secretary was not all pleasant work. Some
querists sent me packets of disgorged food and other nastiness, under
the impression that this would help in diagnosing the cause of illness
in a bird, and although an hour or two in a hospital dissecting-room
in the old days certainly did improve my appetite, I cannot say that
the receipt of these abominations just before breakfast produced a like
effect !

This is a delightfully written book, full of the charm and grace that
characterizes Mr. Hudson's writings. Some of ns remember the greater
portion of this book, viz. the section "Birds in a Village", in a rather
different dress ; but in its new setting it is certainly improved, and,
personally, we wish the author had contented himself with a task well
done and omitted the further new matter. For however highly we

and for his power and facile manner in bringing home to us the poetry
of the countryside, we must refuse to accept him as an authoritative
guide when he enters upon the perplexing subject of the economic

clusions as to the advisability of introducing exotic birds into Great
Britain.
Mr. Hudson is an enthusiastic lover of wild birds, but like many such
he at times allows his enthusiasm to run away with him to the detriment
of his theme, and frequently overlooks the work of others, which is
unfortunate.
His severe strictures on the bird-catcher are fully merited by the
pursuers of this despicable trade, and we hope the time is not far distant
when such a calling will be made illegal.
" Who delights not in a bird ? " the author asks, and after a careful
perusal of this book there will be few who fail to catch something of
its author's enthusiasm, some of the intense joy that a study of wild
birds confers. However beautiful birds may appear in the museum,
or as portrayed by the artist, only he or she who has studied them in
the leafy woods, amid the swamps and marshes, on the mountain-side,
in the sheltered valley, or on the wild sea-coast, really knows how
beautiful and interesting they are : and by all such this book will be
read with interest and appreciation.

sportsman ; but we read that in time his outlook on life and nature
changed, and field-glasses took the place of the gun. He preferred to
watch the habits of living creatures, and in these studies he exercised
infinite patience. This is obvious when we read about the Kingfishers
and their young in " Bird Life in a Western Valley "--which article
strikes us as perhaps the best in the book. Mr. Rees entered on the
living of Exmoor in 1916 with high hopes, but. it is singularly pathetic
to relate that his health suddenly failed, and he died in June, 1917,
" with his trained powers of observation at their height."
Nowand then in these articles we feel the spirit of Richard Jefferies;
for example, in " The Changing Year ", and still more particularly in
" Wild Life and Hard W'eather " ; for the latter article we have a
particularlv high regard. The author had a deeper affection for some
birds than for others, as many happy little flashlight pictures show.
Partridges he calls " our home-loving little ' brown birds whose
presence on a farm is suggestive of all that is idyllic in the rural life
of Britain ". The Dipper is " the cheery, restless, white-breasted
Robin of the brook ". The Kingfisher--" the radiant butterfly-bird."
The Lark--" the carol of a joyous Lark climbing an invisible stairway
to the sky." The Wren--" ever an optimist; in summer and winter
alike he is the same cheery philosopher." The Heron--" the lean
hermit of the wilds." In one place he pays valuable tribute to the real
usefulness of the Dipper.
In the article on the Wood Wren we wish the author had said a
good deal more about the song and call-notes of this fascinating little
warbler--about that strange, shivering song which thrills through the
beech and oak woods in late spring--and about that no less strange
" wailing ", " melancholy ", or " sorrowing " note--as bird students
have variously interpreted it--which is particularly in evidence when
the young are first launched upon the wing.
" Frequently," says the author, in a wistful yet pleasing way,
" I have been struck by this peculiarity in the song of a bird--that it
indicates more than a mere exuberance of joy, more than the one
simple emotion evident in a melodious call-note, and more than
mere wonder, anger, expostulation in the harsh, unmusical note
of alarm." The Skylark's carol " cannot be compared with the

outcome of any emotion felt in the human heart. But it is,
nevertheless, akin to something that strives within us for utterance".
Of the Willow Wren's song, " the low, sweet phrase betokened some
exquisite sentiment beyond description, but which I almost believed
that sympathy enabled me to understand." And of the Dipper,
" Even when the blast is bitter as the breath of death, the stream
still sings among the pebbles by the ford. Perhaps, while seeking his
food beneath the surface of the water, the Dipper had heard the secret
of perpetual happiness whispered by the spirit of the brook--as perhaps
the Wren had often heard it whispered by the spirit of the wind through
the patter of the hail on the withered oak-leaves in the hawthorn
hedge--and for that reason is wholly undismayed. The song of the
Wren is, somehow, in keeping with that of the wind, and the song of
the Dipper with that of the waterfall."
The brief quotations given are evidence of the intense love which
the author had in his heart for wild life. We commend the book to all

dealing with all sorts of difficulties, not only in the way of obtaining
the birds, but in getting them from various places down to the
port and dealing with railway and other unsympathetic people. I know
what getting birds means, because I have got many at various times
from Iceland.
However, I think that whereas it is most essential that rare birds
should be kept from senseless destruction by plumage hunters or dry-
as-dust collectors, yet that the Avicultural Society of the old country
should have licence to import birds for the benefit of Members, and this
argument might be backed up by a statement that the Empire in this
respect should be regarded as one, and that New Zealand birds would

which in proper districts would no doubt thrive well.
Notwithstanding the above you might please mention in the
Magazine that any little inquiries or investigations that I could
reasonably do I should be pleased to undertake.
Yours very truly,
C. Barney Smith.
[We suggest that an investigation into the present status of that
rare and threatened bird the Owl Parrot or Kakapo (Avie. Mag.,
May, 1916) would be of the greatest value. Also any notes on the
protection now accorded to the native birds would be welcomed, not
only by ourselves, but by the Society for the Protection of the Fauna
of the Empire.--G. R.]

OUR HON. BUSINESS SECRETARY
We deeply regret to report that the very serious illness of Dr. Lovell-
Keays notified in our March issue has compelled his resignation from
the Secretaryship of the Society. Acting on high professional advice
Dr. Keays has retired from all work of every description. The deep
sympathy of every Member of the Society will be warmly extended
to him.
At a special meeting of the Executive Mr. J. L. Bor iote. I.A.,
was elected to the vacant office. Mr. Bonhote is well knpv n as an
eminent ornithologist and a former Editor of the Mayazine, and the
Society is fortunate in securing his services. Mr. Bonhote has kindly
consented to also act as Hon. Treasurer, and will shortly assume office.
The best thanks of the Society are due to Mr. Pocock, our present
Secretary, who has now for the third time undertaken these d Mies.
Coming at a time of special strain owing to the absence of Dr. Chalmers
Mitchell, his acceptance of fresh work is warmly appreciated by every
one of us.
G. R.

THE CRY OF OWLS

As your correspondent Mr. R. C. Banks invites opinions upon

<bodyText confidence="0.972383444444445" page_id="10099008"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
this subject (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. XI, No. 3, pp. 39-40),
may I venture upon one or two points that occur to me ? But first
I must join with Mr. T. A. Coward in his defence of Owls' voices (ibid.,
p. 58). Because the screech of the Barn Owl is strident, as the
utterance of its nestlings is wheezy, does it not seem a little unkind to
condemn the voices of Owls generally as " raucous " ? What about the
most beautiful and musical call of the Tawny Owl and the clear bark
of the Long-eared Owl ? Even the chiding note of a nesting Short-
eared Owl is surely no more " raucous " than that, say, of a Hobby
under the same conditions ; the call of the Little Owl, if monotonous,
is quite nice, while the Eagle Owl's full-throated and sonorous " Hoo ! "
so far from being " very much worse " than all these, is actually one
of the noblest of bird voices. But this is by the way. The question is :
Why do Owls utter calls likely to make their hunting more difficult ?
The answer seems to be that they don&apos;t, and that these calls make no
difference one way or the other--unless, indeed, they may make hunting
more easy, in so far as they tend to indifference on the part of the
hunted.

Let us take an analogy from human experience--Death. Man
looks always out upon death ; it will come to him " some day " ; it will
come in old age, the normal and inevitable end. But how seldom does
he picture it as coming earlier, sudden and unexpected, to himself !
Others have bad luck, there are accidents and so forth, but it is a million
to one chance, he thinks, so he just goes along and hopes for the best.
When the sword hangs always above the reveller, the banquet will go
merrily in spite of it. Rabbits will run playing round a fox. (" Some-
one will have to go presently, but it won't be me." And then there
is a bound and a snap and it just is-- him !)
And so with the birds and Voles; they, too, are fatalists. The
Starling sleeps peacefully, the Vole goes on with his nightly pursuits,
though the woods are ringing with the hooting of Tawny Owls, and
Barn Owls are quartering the meadow.
Mice and Voles do not remain motionless for long, nor do they
squat (or " freeze " to use Mr. Banks' word) ; but, if they did, a noise
behind them would not make them run, for creatures that assume
this practical habit remain perfectly still until all but trodden on, so
long as they believe they are not seen.
The summer before last I noticed a Water-rail squatting in a cup-
shaped hollow among some watercress. It would not move, though
I clapped my hands and tried to make it go. Then I picked up a light
stick and dropped it down so that it lay across the cup, supported
by watercress, and about 2 inches above the Rail. The bird never
moved. I withdrew for about ten paces and watched. The bird
could see me and did not move. Going away out of sight I waited
for, perhaps, three or four minutes, and then went back. The Water-
rail was gone ; it had crept out from beneath the stick, and this still
lay exactly as I had placed it.
No one who has watched a Tawny Owl as it sits on a bough listening,
and then goes straight off to its quarry, no one who has examined the
structure of a Barn Owl's external ear can doubt that these birds
hunt more by hearing than by sight. And in another genus, that of
Asio, the ear is yet more remarkably developed.

extending in a semicircular direction from the base of the lower
mandible to above the middle of the eye, and is furnished in its whole
length with an operculum (flap). But what is more extraordinary in
this genus is that the entrance to the ear is asymmetrical--the orifice
on one side opening downwards and on the other upwards. This
curious adaptation is carried still further in the genus Nyctala, con-
taining two or three small species of the Northern Hemisphere, in
which the asymmetry that in Asio is only skin-deep extends, in a
manner very surprising, to several of the bones of the head, as may be
seen in the Zoological Society's Proceedings (1871, pp. 739-43), and
in the large series of figures given by Messrs. Baird, Brewer, &amp; Ridgeway
( N. Am. Birds, iii, pp. 97-102)."--Newton's Dictionary of Birds.
The Barn Owl undoubtedly has a call, other than the screech,
which it utters on the wing, and this, though not a true #i Ivi-wik ",
has something of that character. But does Mr. Coward designate
the Tawny Owl's " Ki-wik " a " flight call " from personal observation ?
It may possibly be sometimes uttered in the air during the bird's
progress from bough to bough ; this is difficult to determine. But
normally it is the call of the female at any season, or of both the female
and young as they sit about in near proximity. Tawny Owls have a
variety of notes. Occasionally in the winter, and always at pairing
time, they hold extraordinary conversations, and indulge in what
appear to be mutual incriminations, and these remarks could not
possibly be syllabled. A night or two since, when several Tawny Owls
only were hooting, I was listening to one who entirely and persistently
dropped the preliminary note and merely uttered one prolonged loud
and level hoot, and this without the tremulo.

were at that time in Echuca, a northerly town of Victoria, where a fine
bridge crosses the Murray into New South Wales. The equipment
needed was a pair of good horses and a large buggy, a calico tent, and
nets ; we also carried a gun apiece, only used for necessary food,
Duck especially. The country here is very flat, and is called Riverina.
Grain is grown by the free selector, and the birds come to the fields in
huge mobs to feed. Our plan was to camp in likely places and watch
their habits, note where they fed and drank, and then lay out our
nets. These were of the folding type, and covered an area of 16 feet
by 30 feet. Concealed in a small trench, they snapped together at
a great pace, which we controlled by watching from a " mla-mia ",
or black fellows hut, made of green boughs over a firm structure, all
cut on the spot. The nets had to be laid before sunrise, so that we were
not seen on the spot to frighten the birds. At the commencement
of our time we caught Galahs, a lovely bird of pink and dove-grey ;
they were in small groups of eight or ten, and sometimes only a pair,
and were generally very common. Later we fell in with a mob of
Cornilla Cockatoos, which we estimated at about 10,000, and came
regularly just after sunrise. We had only two pulls of our nets at
this lot, and totalled 150. We were about fourteen days in this camp,
a lovely spot beside a dam. The slight valley had been scooped out
and the scoopings heaped on the lower end to make this dam, which
covered about an acre. The day we happened to catch was one of
very hard work, with seventy-five Cockatoos in the nets ; one had to be
careful in extricating them, the net would be hidden in their feathers
and they were hopelessly entangled, so our best plan was to use a knife
and free them as quickly as possible. Occasionally one would bite
another, but this was the only loss we sustained ; our hands got bitten
also, but not so much when we learnt how to handle the birds ; the
noise and commotion just after a catch was an incident not to be
forgotten. It was generally past midday by the time we had finished
and could get some breakfast. We were most careful of the birds,
and put them in boxes with wire fronts not too thick, as the heat is
more likely to kill than fright. The whole Cockatoo community is
invisible in the middle of the day, camping, when the sun is hottest,
in the shade of large trees. We found all Australian birds and

mammals to be most easily tamed, and in a very short period too.
We used a call-bird in the nets, and the wild bird will always settle on
the ground to windward of it. The dam was full of bird-life. The
most interesting were the Laughing Jackass, a large Kingfisher,
and his laugh will call the late sleeper. There were a pair of Spur-
winged Plovers about, besides a smaller Plover, which worried us in
the nets ; they paid toll, for we found them a most palatable dish
stewed for breakfast, cooked before " rigor mortis " had set in. Duck
and Teal were present in a number of varieties, of which I should
like to mention one we called the Wood Duck ; I believe its proper name
is " Maimgeese ". This has an exceedingly thick skin, mostly fat,
which when cooking naturally bastes it to a turn.
The Minah is another bird we saw a great many of; they were
about the size of our Thrush, and would give warning of danger to
the whole neighbourhood, which warning would be taken up by birds
in all directions and passed on. The Black Cockatoo was one of the
handsomest of all. The sulphur crest in contrast to the black made it
especially noticeable, but they were very rare in that district. There
were a great number of " Magpies " of two species ; they had a flute-
like whistle, and made their nests on boughs in the open, constructed
of ordinary mud and shaped like a basin. We had our call-birds more
than once attacked by a large Hawk, the name of which we could not
discover, but to give an instance of its rate of flight our nets were
made of the best flaxen string, unable to be broken by the hand, but
this Hawk flew through it as if it was cotton when we pulled it together
to save our call-bird. The Sulphur-crested White Cockatoos were
very common, but difficult to catch in any numbers. Huge Cranes,
known as " Native Companions ", walked the pastures in pairs, and
often came within gunshot. Now we only used our guns to supply
our table, and not in the neighbourhood where we wished to catch, and
then only very sparingly. I once found a locality where a lot of Rosellas
had taken to feeding ; they are very handsome Parrakeets, and I think
of more than one variety. There was no chance here of learning
more than the local names of the birds, as books up country are very
scarce. The whole time I was camping out--about eleven weeks--was
one long holiday, the climate genial and pleasant, and only once did

we have to leave the tent for a dry bed, then we left it standing in a
foot of water ! Luckily we saw no snakes, but previous to this I did
a few weeks' harvesting, when we killed some rather large ones. Often
when resting we watched a species of Quail that roosted on the stooks
of wheat and copied the call of a number of other birds. I think it
was a Lesser Quail.
The water we drank was not good, we boiled it for safety, and only
drank tea. We had to drive 30 miles for our bread, and often pro-
cured a Murray Cod when near a fishing spot; they are a great luxury
well known throughout the south. Now I think I may give one little
tale just to end with. We were calling early one morning on a distant
neighbour. After breakfast he showed us round ; his huts were of
bark over rude poles, but weather-proof, and no bigger than 6 by
12 feet. He had an unusually large number of chickens, and knowing
he had no way of marketing the eggs I asked him what he did with
them. He casually said, " I reckon I feed the dog on them ! "

A Victory for Aviculture : The Penguins of Macquarie Island
Resolution passed by Women's International Congress
calling for legislation in all countries to prevent the destruction
of birds for millinery purposes (May 9).
1916. Resolution carried at the annual meeting of the R.S.P.B.
calling upon the Government to prohibit entirely the importa-
tion of wild birds' plumage as a useless and undesirable import
and a wholly indefensible form of extravagance.
1917. Importation of all plumage prohibited by Board of Trade
proclamation, February 23.
1919. Deputation from the R.S.P.B. received by the President of the
Board of Trade (Sir Auckland Geddes), who, in reply, expresses
the hope that permanent legislation may be obtained, possibly
at the beginning of next year.
Restrictions on importation of plumage removed in common
with restrictions on all other imports, September 1.
Sir Auckland Geddes states in House of Commons (August 18)
that the object would be better attained by special legislation
than by an adaptation of the import restrictions; and
(November 11) that a BILL HAS BEEN DRAFTED, but in
view of the pressure of Parliamentary business no date for its
introduction can be named.

We have received the following from the London Correspondent of
the North Queensland Register :---
" At the Brisbane congress of the Royal Australian Ornithologists'
Union Mr. C. Lord (Tasmania) emphasized the necessity for the
Macquarie Island being made a sanctuary for the preservation of the
Penguin. Captain White (South Australia) moved that this union
is of the opinion that Macquarie Island should be declared a sanctuary
for the perpetuation of the fauna of the Antarctic. He said that the
Federal Government proposed to buy the island from Tasmania,

which asked #15,000 for it. This was rather high, seeing that the
island was leased for #40 a year for private exploitation. Dr. Mawson
had said there would very soon be a dash into Antarctica to secure its
furs and oils, and it was very desirable that the Federal Government
should step in and make a sanctuary on Macquarie Island. Mr. Lord
seconded the motion, which was carried, and the Council was empowered
to take action even to the expenditure of funds to secure the object of
the motion."
Our sister association, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds,
now reports as follows in Bird Notes and News :--
" The long-continued efforts of the Society on behalf of the
persecuted Penguins of Macquarie Island have at last borne the fruit
desired. It is announced that the Government of Tasmania has
refused to renew the lease of the island to Mr. Joseph Hatch and his
oil company, which for years has been massacring the birds at the
rate of a million and a half a year for the sole purpose of boiling them
down for their oil. It may be remembered that as long ago as 1905
a resolution carried at the International Ornithological Congress, at
the instigation of the Society, was cabled to the Tasmanian Government
protesting against the business ; but unhappily the lease was later on
renewed. Letters of remonstrance and appeal have since been addressed
by the R.S.P.B. to the New Zealand and Tasmanian Governments, and
to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. The subject was again
brought forward last March at the Annual Meeting of the R.S.P.B. ;
Mr. Mattingley, the Society's representative in Australia, offered his
services to go over and investigate the facts ; Mr. Pycraft ventilated
the matter in the Press ; Mr. H. G. Wells made it the subject of a
powerful passage in The Undying Fire ; Sir Douglas Mawson spoke
strongly upon it before the Zoological Society of London ; Mr. Cherry-
Garrard roused public opinion through The Times and the Spectator.
At last the hideous slaughter is brought to an end.
" ' We venture to hope,' says The Times (December 29, 1919),
' that a further step will be taken, and that means will be found to
make Macquarie Island an inviolable sanctuary for Antarctic life.' "

By the late 0. E. Cresswell
(Communicated by Miss Frances Cresswell.)
(Continued from p. 68.)
The last (fourth) of the Asiatic Psittacidae to which I would allude
are the beautiful little Parrotlets of Ceylon, the Malay Peninsula, and
the Great Islands. They are Parrots of the tiniest dimensions and
most elegant form. They are rarely seen in captivity, simply, I
believe, because they rarely survive the voyage. Some of the most
interesting of them are the Hanging Parrakeets, who spend almost
their whole time hanging head downwards from twigs or in cages from
their perches. The few which do reach these shores are generally
sold as " Lovebirds ", which they much resemble ; they must not,
however, be compared with the Lovebirds proper of Africa. The latter
all have broad tails when spread out. These Parrotlets of Asia, as
well as those from South America, have pointed tails&apos;.
I pass to the African Continent. This is not really rich in Parrots,
unless we consider that the amazing talent of the Grey Parrot makes
up for the few species which inhabit the great continent, and its
adjacent island Madagascar. Of the larger Parrots the only species
I can trace are : in Madagascar, the Great Black Vasa, to which I have
already alluded ; the famous Grey, from the south and south-west
regions; the short-tailed particoloured Senegal Parrot; and the
Green Ring-necked Parrakeet (similar to the Bengal Parrakeet, but
a trifle larger), which is found in Senegambia and eastward across
the Continent.
Of the Lovebirds proper (Agapornis) there are seven species--four
of the greatest rarity and three which are well known:--

A peculiarity of the Lovebirds is that they--at least, I believe the
hens alone do it--carry up stuff for the lining of their nests in the
feathers of their tails. The vast family of Parrots is almost at one in

depositing eggs in the bare bottoms of trees ; any exception to this
rule is therefore of interest.
We come now to the New World. When first the great explorers
of the fifteenth century set foot on American soil, of all the wonders
of the New World nothing can have struck them more than the
marvellous beauty of the feathered tribe. In North America we have
but one Parrot, the Carolina Conure. Central America, South America,
and the West Indian Islands are rich in gorgeous examples of the tribe.
I will select the three most important tribes of this Continent for brief
description. They are the Macaws, the Amazons, and the Conures.
We probably all know the Macaws, at one time looking so quiet in
their solemn stateliness and then nearly cracking the drums of our ears
with their piercing shrieks. They are natives of the vast forests of
Brazil and Guiana, and in a natural state, as in captivity, are most
destructive. I have already alluded to their great power of varying
their voice and imitating the tones of individual human utterances.
An anecdote is told of a raw Austrian recruit who was brought to
Vienna ; he saw a Grand Military Macaw standing solemn and motion-
less on a stand ; he walked round and round it gaping. At last the bird
said " You blockhead ". The frightened recruit saluted humbly, and
gasped out " I beg your honour's pardon ; I thought you were a bird ! "
The Macaws are very many ; about six species are often imported.
First and greatest, not so often seen as others, is the Hyacinthine--
as its name implies, of blue shades. A gigantic bird, the largest of
the Psittacidae, it has not the bare skin on the face seen in most Macaws.
Then there is the well-known Blue and Orange species ; the Green or
Noble Macaw, with a dash of crimson on the wing ; the splendid
Military Macaw of green tones, with rich red tail; the still more
gorgeous Red and Blue Macaw, with dashes of green ; least in size of
the great tribe is Illigers, but not least, I think, in interest or intelligence.
A specimen of mine began captive life under evil influence ; he went
to a dealer because his master went to prison ; he came to me because
the dealer owed me money and could not pay it; I neglected his
education because I did not want a Macaw ! He is entirely a self-
made person--says many things in many voices--is very affectionate,
though a little uncertain--and after learning all the Cockie used to say
has practically silenced him from his jealousy.

The Amazons are a numerous race, and as I have already said, the
closest rivals in speech of the Greys. They have, too, this advantage,
that they are not subject to the mysterious fever to which multitudes
of the latter succumb. They are Parrots proper, Psittaci with short
tails, and their home is tropical South America, with the exception of
one small and pretty species, the white-fronted Cuban Amazon. By
far the best known is the Blue-fronted, which is almost always a more
or less proficient talker ; others are the Festive Amazon, green with
a red back and forehead ; Le Vaillants, or the Double-fronted, which
has a yellow head and neck ; the Yellow-naped ; the Mealy, the latter
all green with a bloom on its plumage which the French call poudre.
The last American race to which will I allude are the Conures or
Wedge-tailed Parrots. They all have fairly long tails for their size,
but differ vastly in colour, dimensions, and characteristics. Few of
the many species talk; but one, the Patagonian Conure (my specimen
of which is probably known to most of you from the power of his lungs)
is often a fair speaker. The tribe is remarkable for this, that whereas
one species, the Patagonian Conure, is found farther south than any
other Parrot even, i.e. at the Straits of Magellan, another, the
Carolina Conure, is the one Parrot of North America, and has been
found as far north as Ontario.

Handlist of the Birds of Egypt. By M. J. Nicoll, F.Z.S.,
M.B.O.U. pp. xii, 119, with map and 31 plates (8 coloured). Cairo :
Government Press. 1919.
Since Shelley's Handbook is now out of date and has also become
somewhat scarce, we are pleased to be able to recommend to the bird-
loving visitor to Egypt, as well as to the ornithologist, this work from
the pen of one so competent to write on the subject as the Assistant
Director of the Egyptian Zoological Service.
The work, however, is more than a mere list, as in addition to giving
the status of each of the 436 species and subspecies recorded as having
occurred in Egypt, Mr. Nicoll has added a short diagnosis of each form,

which should, in most cases, prove sufficient for a preliminary identifica-
tion. In this connexion we may, perhaps, be permitted to point out
one error. The collar of the adult Ringed Plover is stated to be black
in summer and brown in winter ; whereas the brown collar is a mark
of immaturity. The same statement is made respecting the Little
Ringed Plover.
We regret that Mr. Nicoll has to record the virtual extinction in
Egypt of the Egyptian Plover, which was probably the most
characteristic and beautiful bird in the country, though, by way of
compensation, we note that the Buff-backed Egret has increased in
numbers since it has received protection from the plume-hunters.
Newton, basing his conclusion on the character of its very limited
resident avifauna, included Egypt in the Ethiopian region, whereas
Wallace and Mr. Nicoll assign it to the Palaearctic. The great interest
of the ornithology of Egypt lies in the fact that the Nile Valley is a
main highway of migration between the Palaearctic and Ethiopian
regions, and that into it converge both Eastern and Western Palsearctic
forms. We hope that in the near future Mr. Nicoll will be able to
give us fuller particulars of migration in Egypt than he has been able
to cite in the present work.
The book is illustrated with eight somewhat inartistic coloured
plates, and twenty-four black and white ones from photographs of skins.
These latter include an interesting series of eleven plates of the species
of Chats occurring in Egypt. It would, however, have been well if
the exact provenance and dates of collection of the specimens figured
had been given.

Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- It is somewhat difficult to advise
Capt. Rattigan on the choice of a natural history camera without
knowing exactly the branch of the work he desires to take up.
If he wishes to specialize in what one may term the " wait and
see " branch, entailing the use of hiding tents and other forms of
camouflage, a stand camera is frequently more useful than a hand
camera. Should he wish, however, to take up more general work,

Our Hon. Secretary ancl Treasurer
embracing subjects varying from an elephant to a bird-eating spider,
there is only one form of camera, namely the " reflex ", that can be
recommended. It must be borne in mind, however, that no matter
what type be selected, it is the lens that is the all-important part.
This should work at an aperture of not less than f. 5'6, and by
preference f. 4/5.
The camera itself should embody a focal-plane shutter. A revolving
back to obviate the necessity of removing the dark slide when
it is desired to change the plate from an upright to a horizontal
position, and a double extension focussing rack, enabling one to
photograph small objects, such as beetles, fish, butterflies, etc., at
a distance of a foot or less, are desirable additions.
Keflex cameras and good lenses are rather expensive. I think about
#15 would be about the figure at present prices for a quarter-plate
camera, but good second-hand ones are often obtainable.
Should Capt. Rattigan care to communicate with me direct, I shall
be pleased to go into matters more fully.
Yours faithfully,
W. S. Berridge.

The Avicultural Magazine was founded in 1894 to promote the
study of British and foreign birds in freedom and captivity. It is with
regard to the scope of our journal that the Editor desires to speak,
and to deal with matters that have long been on his mind.
The dual nature of the Society's activities--being devoted to birds
" in freedom and captivity "--of course, regulates both the amount and
the nature of the copy received. Thus one number may tend more to
field notes, while another is mainly devoted to purely avicultural work,
speaking in the restricted sense of the aviary and bird-room. In order
that in each issue there may be " something for everybody " the
contents are varied as much as possible, and occasionally matters of the
moment are touched upon if they appear to be of essential importance.
Thus, in recent numbers reference has been made to the Plumage Bill ;
at first sight this may seem a far from avicultural subject, but it is, of
course, of the highest moment to support any form of bird protection,
since the extermination of any species postulates its disappearance
for ever from our aviaries. What would one not give for accurate notes
on the nesting of the Dodo, the juvenal plumage of the Reunion Starling,
or the egg of the Labrador Duck ?
During the War more purely avicultural science was in abeyance,
owing to the practical closing of the bird market and the absence of
many aviculturists on active service. There was no means of replacing

pre-War specimens as they gradually died off; in the end scarcely any-
one had any birds at all, the largest collections became a shadow of
their former selves. Under these circumstances strictness was relaxed,
and all contributions that could in a broad sense be called avieultural
were accepted.
With the coming of peace and the withdrawal of import restrictions
it was hoped to restore the original character of the Magazine. Thus
the report of the Council (Avic. Mag., December, 1919) suggests that as
opportunities for restocking their depleted aviaries occurred members
would have no difficulty in supplying the Editor with articles or para-
graphs on aviculture. Material is not lacking ; it is well known that
the post-War importations of birds were readily bought up even at
post-War prices, and that the reopened market is well patronized at
the present time. Already the pendulum is moving, and excellent
avieultural papers of pre-War standard have begun to appear. Birds
of Paradise, Parrots, Owls, Ivagus, and Woodpeckers have recently
occupied these pages, to the pleasure and profit of all of us.
Now we ask for more and more purely avieultural papers, to complete
the reconstruction so well begun. We want to fulfil the original purpose
of the Magazine. We want the possessors of new stock to write about it:
there is very much to learn about common birds even, and the humble
Waxbill and Avadavat is by no means to be despised. Then the
fortunate owners of rarities, Cassowaries, Trogons, Sun Bitterns--
we know such gentlemen exist--would much benefit our science if
they would put pen to paper. Our Society includes many veteran
aviculturists of wide experience besides its younger members, and it
would indeed be excellent to join forces for the common good. All
contributions will be carefully considered, and those who may not
care to write a paper could at any rate contribute an avieultural note.
Such co-operation would not only hasten recovery, but materially
lighten the labours of the Editor. When all is said, it is the contributors
who make the Magazine, who hold its future in their hands, who
determine its character. We believe that a full return to ]jre-War
aviculture is the wish of every member of the Society, but the speed
of the return is determined by the nature of the papers submitted,
and no Editor can print jxipers if members do not write them. Wholly

dependent upon his contributors, he cannot evolve papers and articles
out of thin air.
Every former Editor will agree that this historic chair is by no means
a bed of roses. The editing of the Magazine (now thanks to its
contributors one of the leading natural history journals of the world)
is no sinecure, and by no means consists, as is popularly imagined,
of stringing together in haphazard fashion more or less suitable articles.
Only the best work is worth doing, and to produce a journal compatible
with the time-honoured traditions of the Society demands constant
and exacting labour. To all the normal disabilities are now added the
trials of post-War editing, a disconcerting novelty unknown before the
War, though accepted as in the day's work ; happily months of War
experience prove a great resource. The Editor gives his services
during the intervals of a life devoted to the most exacting of all
professions ; this is done willingly, but it is seemly that the facts should
be known.
Contributors are asked to strengthen the hands of the Editor (and
we believe the Council to be also favourable) by continuing the output
of more purely avicultural " copy ". The post-War specimens are
certainly somewhere; we suggest that on account of the high prices now
obtaining they are largely in the aviaries of our wealthier members,
and it is to them more particularly that Aviculture looks for pioneer
observations on rare birds. Regarding commoner species, if the
Magazine is to be really and truly the journal for beginners, records of
successes (or almost equally interesting failures) are the order of the day.
We believe the present number to be the most purely avicultural
issue that has appeared since the Armistice. We hold that it is no part of
an Editor's duty to be garrulous, but rather to be silent and self-effacing,
but the present is the time to speak, and although reconstruction has
been slow we trust that it is sure, and that the house at last set in order
will so continue. We have before us many of the pre-War volumes of
the Magazine, edited by Mr. Astley and his predecessors; they are full
of excellent articles and notes, hints on feeding, housing, breeding,
avicultural news in the best style. It is to this standard that we now
suggest approximation, infusing new life into the Magazine, so that the
future shall be brighter than the past.

I feel that this title is somewhat misleading, for my bird has no
mate, and therefore the " nesting " must perforce stop short before
the really interesting part begins. For all that it may be as well to
record the attempt, for as far as I know this species has not previously
gone to nest in England. Moreover, my bird is so extraordinarily
tame that all her ways can be noted.
When I bought her in 1912 she was still in nestling plumage ; an
egg was dropped in 1918, but she did not attempt to sit. This year she
called loudly and persistently a shrill single hoot, from the middle
of January onwards, and evidently desired a mate, but unfortunately
none was procurable. On March 5 I found her on the floor of her
house with an egg which she intended to incubate, but as it is the duty
of the male bird to prepare the " scrape " none was provided, and the
egg rolled about and would inevitably have been broken. She made
no objection to my making a scrape for her in a dry secluded corner
of the aviary, the floor of which is of coarse sand, and when I placed
the egg in it she followed and I left her quietly sitting. Ths egg is of
the usual Owl type, round and white, rather large, about the bigness
of a Leghorn hen's egg.
She sits very steadily, and has settled down to a regular routine.
I go to her about noon, and we exchange a few remarks and caresses,
after which I give her a mouse or a few morsels of rabbit, which she
takes from my hand. Presently she comes off the nest and flies to
her perch, where she preens and stretches herself, in the sun if possible.
In about ten minutes' time she flies back to her egg, alighting about
a yard from it, and walks to the scrape, turns the egg and settles down
with it between her legs, with her talons carefully folded on either side
of it. Normally I suppose there would be two eggs in a clutch, but
I do not know whether youth or the absence of the male is responsible
for only one being laid in this case.
She takes very little food, one mouse or a sparrow in twenty-four
hours (though more is provided it is not touched), and she likes to have

it broken up for her, which I suppose would normally be done by her
mate when he returned from hunting; unlike my other Owls she
neither drinks nor bathes at this time, though when not incubating she
regularly uses her bath. If strangers come near she dashes angrily
at them, but she will let me sit beside her and stroke her, and even put
my hand under her and feel the egg.
I suppose this Owl inhabits sandy or desert districts, for the tawny
plumage of the head and back, barred and flecked with black, would
be practically invisible in either sand or dry yellowish grass, and the
eartufts would heighten the resemblance.
It is greatly to be hoped that I shall succeed in obtaining a mate
for my bird, and that next year the rearing of young can be recorded.

BIRDS OF PARADISE IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9654072" page_id="10099032"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
By A. S. Le Souef, Director of the Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney
Taronga Park was fortunate in securing several Birds of Paradise
in November, 1916. There were six different kinds--Raggi's,
Magnificent, King, Six-wired, Superb, and the Albert Rifle-bird ; while
a pair of Blue Birds of Paradise were afterwards received on deposit.
They were rather rough when received, and had started to moult,
two or three being lost before this ordeal was over.
They were placed in two large wire aviaries, divided according to
size, for they are pugnacious, and the larger kinds will kill smaller
birds and eat them. The Six-wired, Magnifieents, Superbs, and Kings
were placed together, and got along very well, but a collection of
Finches in the same enclosure was gradually caught and eaten by the
Six-wired.
All the birds proved remarkably hardy, but not good Zoo exhibits,
as they stick to cover for most of the day, only coming into the open
during the early morning and in the evening. They cannot stand much
sun or light, and experience shows that they require a closed-in
compartment where they can sit during the day in semi-darkness.
All the birds here that have not done well that I have been able to
trace have been in enclosures that were insufficiently covered.

Adequate cover and protection from the light is in my opinion one of
the most important considerations in the successful keeping of these
birds.
Moulting is, as may be imagined, a severe task in the Paradiseidae,
and the losses we have sustained have been during that period. The
moult starts about November and continues until April; when the
young feathers are growing the birds come into the bright sunlight
in the morning and thoroughly sun different qiarts of the plumage,
straining themselves into special positions for perhaps half an hour at
a time in order to let the sun play on some particular spot, and this is
the only time that I have seen them enjoy the sun. Another peculiarity
is that during the early moult, when they are almost bare of feathers,
they like to roost in the open. If a sudden storm catches them and they
cannot regain cover they are killed, so that special precautions have to
be taken to prevent this.
Our birds are fed on a variety of food, including hard-boiled egg,
crushed hemp, cake, apples, bananas, raw meat, and occasionally
white earth grubs and mealworms. The food is generally mixed
together and made rather dry, so that fermentation will not take
place in the very hot weather.
During the breeding-season the birds become very active, and
in the case of the raggianas very noisy, each species having quite
a different love display. The raggianas partially raise their plumes
and very rapidly flutter their wings, keeping the head low; sometimes
the plumes are raised, but only for a moment. The Blue Bird of
Paradise hangs under the bough on which the female is sitting, and
works the feathers of the under parts in a rhythmic motion, at the
same time uttering a croak. The most peculiar display is given by
the Magnificent. In this he depresses the body and makes himself
into a long pear shape, or like a lady with a full bottom skirt; at the
same time the yellow fan-like plumes at the back of the head are
raised ; this will suddenly be altered, the neck plumes lowered and
the body broadened by spreading all the plumes laterally, and the
head is depressed into the body so that he then looks like a spinning
top upside down. There must be a very complete set of muscles under
the skin to work this change.

The Six-wired loves to play about under a small bush, generally
with a small stick; he dances and prances about in a most absurd
manner, occasionally raising breast and abdominal plumes so that
from the front ho looks like a ball of feathers.
These birds are only of special interest for a comparatively short
time of the year, and for only a part of the day even then. One seldom
sees the wonderful beauty of their fantastic plumage, more especially
in the darker varieties, which require a special light, which they seldom
enter, to show off the colours.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
It was with great pleasure that I was reminded of our late member,
Mr. 0. E. Cresswell, by the appearance in the March number of the
Magazine of the commencement of his interesting article on the Parrots ;
but I was rather surprised that he should write of the Grey Parrot as
South African. Mr. Cresswell's remarks about the Grey Parrot's
" throaty voice " and inability to change its voice no doubt were
based upon birds which had been improperly taught. Most owners
of Parrots, as I have frequently noticed, consider it necessary to talk
through their noses to their birds ; perhaps the large curved upper
mandible reminds them of Punch and therefore they assume that a
Parrot ought to talk in the fashion of Punchinello.
Now, when I started to teach my young Grey to talk, I spoke to
him in my natural voice, and I instructed other members of my house-
hold to do the same ; the result was that my bird not only spoke
far more distinctly than I ever heard an Amazon Parrot do, but it
altered the tone in imitation of different members of the family, so as
frequently to deceive them ; it learned to know each of us by name,
and never made a mistake in addressing us. Each morning when I
approached its cage my Grey used to say, " Arthur, good morning ! "
" Are you all right ? " When I assented he would say, " Quite right,"
and then he would turn his head, looking at me sideways, and say,
" You're a rascal! " and when 1 reproved him for rudeness he answered,
" Bobby's a rascal ! " I called him Bobby because he was a cock bird,

the appropriate character of many remarks made by Parrots; how and

THE CRY OF OWLS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9950525" page_id="10099035"  page_num="100" year="" vol="">
By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo
The voices of the various species of owls have no connexion what-
ever with taking of prey. All Owls hunt alone, and complete silence
is the essence of their success. This is most admirably provided for
by nature. When an Owl has caught something and is bringing it to
the nest, it will utter the particular call that means it is coming
with food, so that the female may come and take that food for
distribution.
The various cries are connected principally with finding mates ;
communicating with their mate ; calling the young ; warning the
young ; rapture of breeding, the same as the song of any other bird,
such as the Blackbird, Robin, Lapwing, Curlew, for the song has the
same meaning in such widely different genera.
The Wood Owls-- Strix= Syrnium ( auctorum )--of which our Tawny
Owl is an example, have, perhaps, as fine a vocabulary as any species.
The clear, bell-like hoot of the male may be heard in all directions,
but no two hoot exactly alike. Gilbert White draws attention to this
in his letter of August 1, 1771. It is easy to learn to distinguish the
voice of each Owl in one's particular neighbourhood, and the voice
can be heard distinctly in favourable weather at the distance of over
a mile. Both sexes hoot: the male is clear and generally deep-toned,
the female mostly with effort and a much higher pitch, also far less
frequently. Both sexes utter the short sharp cry rendered by your
correspondent as " Tih-vac --the female frequently, the male very
rarely. This cry is the adult development of the nestling cry for food,
rendered by the late Professor Newton by the word " Kee-wick
This cry, according to the way in which it is uttered, has many meanings.
If low and anxiously in the breeding season it means that the young

must keep quiet. When the male gives a loud clear hoot by day in
early spring whilst the female is sitting she will reply if in hearing, by
this cry almost in the tone of a nestling. The hoot of the Tawny Owls
gathers volume with distance ; when uttered close it often does not
sound at all loud.
The same applies to the soft deep " Boo " of the male Eagle Owl.
In mountains and forests it can be heard for a long distance, but in
one's aviary it seems quite insignificant. Both sexes of the Eagle
Owls (Bubo) hoot, that of the male differing from the female in much
the same manner as that of the Wood Owls ; also both sexes utter an
adult development of the nestling call for food.
All the Barn Owls --Tyto = Strix (auctorum ), a genus spread over
the whole world--have more or less the same voice, a whistling screech.
This is uttered in many tones, and conveys many meanings : fear,
anger, caution, etc. It is the development of the nestling cry, as can
easily be proved by any one who has a brood of Barn Owls in their
surroundings. No Barn Owl develops any form of hoot, but the males
introduce a somewhat musical rattle into their screech when playing
on the wing, in early summer. However numerous Barn Owls may be,
they hunt alone and in silence. This last winter they have hunted
by daylight nearly every day, and it has been quite usual to see six
or seven in a short walk. They occasionally, but very rarely, catch a
mouse, which seems at present to be a very rare animal.
The Little Owls ( Athene ) and Scops Owls (Scops) have many cries,
and both have a musical hoot difficult to describe. The old specific
name Gin was evidently meant to represent the monotonous cry of the
Scops ; this cry is the breeding call.
Should not the portrait of the "Farmer's Friend " have been repre-
sented by our Barn Owl--not an exotic Bubo ?

Dr. John Kerr Butter
that genial kindly soul to which the surest passport was a love of
animals. Dr. Butter served with distinction in the South African War,
where he was attached to Lord Roberts' Staff.
At Cannock, whither he removed from his native Forfar in 1887,
he had a roomy old-fashioned house, a field, and a large practice,
which enabled him to indulge in his favourite hobby. Even before he
left Scotland he had made acquaintance with Mr. E. Bostock, with
whom he spent almost all his annual holiday in the living wagon
of the Show (varied by occasional trips of zoological inspection on
the Continent), and with whom he was contemplating an early and
more adventurous trip embracing Africa from Cairo to the Cape.
Among the caravans his annual visits marked an epoch ; his sympathy
was always on the side of the wanderers in their continual
struggles for their prescriptive rights so often challenged--he used
to tell with great gusto the tale of two horses impounded by a local
authority, and their woeful apologies to the circus-owner when they
found that their law lore was shorter than his. " And it cost them a 2 d.
rate to get out of it," he concluded with a smile.
He was humorous and kind-hearted ; his great professional skill
was free to every living thing in and about the menagerie--a sore
finger or an operation on the big Elephant--a case of croup or
tincture of iodine for the Ostrich's throat. In the last letter I received
from him was a lament on the death of a young Elephant that had been
sent too late to Cannock.
On his three-acre field he had a fine collection of birds and beasts,
which was free to the neighbourhood except when some local hospital
needed funds. At one time or another there were all things from
Zebras to Squirrels. The dwarf Zebu would put its muzzle into
one's hand--the Ostrich run up with outspread wings--and there was
the sitting Rhea that it was well to avoid. In the aviaries were many
kinds of Parrakeets, Macaws, and Cockatoos--Herons, too, and Owls
and the smaller Cranes. Civets, Jackals, and Llamas bred regularly
at Cannock, and the Monkeys (chiefly Drills and Mandrills) were fine
specimens. Dr. Butter kept the rare and delicate Fossa for years ;
he had an Ocelot as cage mate for the Chimpanzee ; everything was
done without regard to zoological convention, and none of the houses

were heated. Fancy raising a weak and puling Chimpanzee on the hills
at Cannock, and seeing it develop into a perfect wonder! The event
is unique, but the Doctor took it as a matter of course--this great
naturalist did not know his greatness.
Dr. Butter was not married. Our hearts go out in sympathy to
the sister who kept house for him and gave so cheery a welcome to his
friends.

[A portrait of Dr. Butter appeared in our volume for 1918; papers
by him on the Emu and Common Bhea were published in the
Avicultural Magazine for July of last year ; his final contribution
immediately follows this notice. Well known as police surgeon and
as an expert witness in medico-legal cases, he was also a lecturer and
examiner for the St. John's Ambulance Society. The public respect
for his memory was shown by the thousands who thronged the streets
of Cannock on May 4, when the funeral was held in Cannock Parish
Church previous to cremation at Glasgow.--G. B.]

By the late John K. Butter, M.D.
I have a Grey Parrot which has been in my possession for twenty-
two years, and is always kept in the kitchen in a large roomy cage.
I noticed three weeks ago that although she fed fairly well, she was
listless, drooping, and unable to lift her leg up as usual to hold her
food in her claws. 1 thought she must be suffering from rheumatism.
As she did not seem to improve and preferred to sit in the bottom of
the cage, instead of on the perch, I got her out and examined her care-
fully. 1 noticed every now and then, at intervals of three or four
minutes, she was in pain and straining badly ; her droppings were
passed with a great deal of mucus and wind. A round swelling could
be seen and felt through the skin of the abdomen ; with the help of
some vaseline I was able to make out the form of an egg and that she
was egg-bound, so I vaselined the passage and the egg well with my
finger. She was shivering a good deal, so I put her in front of the fire
on the top rail of a kitchen chair, after giving her three drops of white

chlorodyne in warm water. She evidently got relief from this, as she
slept at intervals between the pain of straining. I was writing at the
time, and my attention was arrested by hearing something drop on
the mat in front of the chair. It was an egg fully formed with shell
complete, but unfortunately broken. She was much relieved after this,
and went on well for three days, when I had to deal with a protrusion
of the passage. I tried several ointments, but only got it right after
applying a ten per cent solution of cocaine, which gave relief to the
pain and enabled me to replace it. I then freely applied a solution of
nitrate of silver, 40 grains to the ounce, all over the inside of the passage.
She has had no trouble since, and is again becoming lively, eating,
whistling, and talking as usual.

By F. D. Welch, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.
One day when walking towards the tunnel in the Zoological Gardens
I met Bertling (the then head-keeper) carrying three European Bitterns,
which were a few minutes after turned loose in the large aviary near the
Clock Tower. As there were various other birds kept there, such as
Curassows and Ibises of various species, I waited to see if attacks were
made on the new arrivals. It was soon clear that these Bitterns,
although only about three-quarters grown, were more than a match
for the various Curassows, these large, Turkey-like creatures retreating
before the pecks of the new birds. On these and subsequent occasions
when quarrelling with a bird of another genus, the Bittern has always
pecked at once, as soon as it was threatened.
Soon after an adult American Bittern and an adult European
Bittern were put into one of the enclosures which used to stand where
the Sea Lion pond is now, both birds living together on friendly terms.
On one occasion they approached each other when walking round
opposite sides of a small shrub which was growing near the centre of
the enclostire, and almost collided. Remembering how Bitterns had
attacked other birds with vigorous pecks from their sharp beaks,
I expected to see these two at once begin fighting, as both were in good
health and condition. But to my great surprise both Bitterns

immediately withdrew some inches and remained perfectly still on the
defensive, facing each other with wings partly open. Their feathers
were erect, heads drawn back, and beaks in readiness for a sudden
thrust; each bird kept its eyes firmly fixed on the other ready for battle.
As they faced one another they looked far grander and more attractive
than they had done a few seconds before when approaching each other
round the bush. Neither bird was anxious to fight; each appeared to
realize that it would prove to be a tough battle, judging by the very
extreme watchfulness displayed and the complete indifference that
both birds showed to me and a keeper, although we had both entered the
enclosure and stood only about 5 feet away. It is interesting to add
that the keeper, although he was not aware of my thoughts, expressed
the same opinion.
After watching them face each other for about two minutes, during
which both remained perfectly still, we decided to time them, and
although I repeatedly waved my umbrella between their beaks, and even
pushed each bird along the ground for over 2 feet (keeping them
parallel in the journey), they flatly refused to take their eyes off each
other, and remained for just over seven minutes in position, after
which they decided to postpone hostilities.
The incident suggested that when two Bitterns in the wild state
disagree they proceed with far greater caution than when opposed by
another bird of different genus -- each apparently realizing that its
opponent has a sharp beak which it can use with effect. I have,
however, never witnessed a combat between wild Bitterns. Perhaps
some other reader has had this experience.

Zebra Finches, Roseate Cockatoos--I know also that some King

I expect the Kagus to-morrow, and a few selected rare birds from
private aviaries, but Australian dealers have no stock, and the Zoos
there are very, very short of birds.

The Conures are a hardy race. The most beautiful Conure, if not
the most beautiful of all the Psittacidae, is the Conurus luteus , or
Queen of Bavaria's Parrakeet. It is extremely rare, and I had never
seen a living specimen till last October, when I was enchanted with the
sight of one in the Jardin d'Acclimatation of Paris. Alas ! poor
thing, confined in a small cage utterly unworthy of so glorious a
creature! All pictures and all stuffed specimens had led me to expect
the prevailing hue of the bird to be primrose colour. In reality it is
the richest amber. The green, too, of the wings is the vivid green of
tropical vegetation. There are other brilliant Conures--neither rare
nor dear in this country--the gaudy Jendaya, its hues orange, green,
and blue with flashes of scarlet; the Sun Parrakeet of bright orange
and green ; and a host of smaller species, generally seen in pairs. I have
a little pair--Cactus Conures, I believe is their proper name--which
I have possessed towards four years. I cannot say that their intelligence
is of a high order; still, they show signs of wild delight whenever I return
home after an absence of some time.
I must not leave America without saying a word about one other
Parrakeet, so peculiar that it does not seem to fit into any genus. In
Latin it is the Bolborhynclms monachus, in English variously called the

the Psittacidoe builds itself a nest in a tree, and that a very elaborate
one. It is a gentle and tamable bird and often to be bought at
a low price.
I pass to Australia, and here I must beware of wearying you, for
Australia abounds with many genera of the Psittacidae. Some of them
are peculiar favourites of my own, and I think quite among the loveliest
of the tribe. First come several of the handsomest Cockatoo race,
others of which we have already found in the East Indian Islands.
The latter are nearly pure white; the Australian are beautifully tinted
with various shades, and are in some cases entirely coloured.

Avicultural Reconstruction.-- I have been living here for
about a fortnight, and though the park is by no means ready it is fenced
all round, and the first arrivals are enjoying semi-liberty. Besides some
mammals there are White-necked and Stanley Cranes, Emus, Rheas,
a pair of Trumpeter Swans, Ross's, Pale-headed, Magellanic, Canada,
Bernicle, Bar-headed and Coreopsis Geese, two dozen Falcated and
Chilian Pintail Ducks, Speeifer Peafowl, Crossoptilons, and Siamese
Firebacks. It is a small beginning, but I enjoy these few birds
very much.
I expect the aviaries (outdoor and indoor) and the enclosures will
be ready for June or July. Mme. Lecallier is kindly keeping a lot of
rare and interesting birds for me until my installations are set up.
She has now a wonderful collection, especially of Parrakeets and Parrots.

Barn Owl Hunting in Daylight. --An individual of this species
seems to have taken to hunting regularly by day in the country round,
as I saw it in daylight and also in sunshine during February and March.
This day habit of hunting is most likely due to decrease in the supply
of Mice, etc. (also referred to by Mr. Trevor Battye in the Field, p. 201),
making it necessary for individual Owls to hunt longer hours in order
to obtain sufficient. A few summers ago another Owl used to hunt

A Geographical Bibliography of British Ornithology. By
W. Ii. Mullens, H. K. Swann, and F. C. R. Jourdain. Part III.
Witherby &amp; Co.
Part iii of the Geographical Bibliography of British Ornithology
includes the counties from Middlesex to Surrey, embracing such
important ornithological areas as Norfolk, Northampton, Northumber-
land, and Oxford. A glance through these shows that it is not the
geographical position alone that makes the county of interest, but rather
the prominence into which it is brought by its conscientious workers.
We feel that it is the man who makes the county, and not the county the
man, or, in other words, that any area will produce something worthy
of observation if we will trouble to observe. We could wish, however,
that it had been possible to dig out from obscurity the valuable notes
of observations buried in little-known publications ; the references in
this work show that a certain number of well-known journals have been
examined, but others have been neglected. The editors should have
had more help from local workers.

HEN ROBINS

Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- I have lately been told that the hen Robin
has a red breast--I thought she was all brown--and it is against the
general rule that hen birds are modestly dressed and the cocks wear
the gaudy colours. Still, no one whom I have asked seems sure of
seeing a full-grown Robin without a red breast.--Yours sincerely,
Frances Cresswell.
Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- Both sexes of the Robin have sienna-reddish
breasts ; the colour is not red at all, and therefore the legend about
the Robin getting its breast colour through trying to pull the nails
out of the Cross is the more ridiculous.

A hen Robin is a more stocky bird than her mate, and consequently
has a less alert appearance ; her bill is noticeably shorter and her
crown broader ; the sienna-reddish all round the base of the bill, both
on forehead and chin, is dull and smoky, and the middle of the throat
is duller and more sandy-coloured than in the male. When one once
knows what to look for one can tell the sex of a Robin yards away at
a glance.

We desire to state that the Duchess of Bedford whose death was
reported in our May issue was not the Duchess who is our Vice-
President. The error, which we hasten to correct, was unfortunately
noted too late for press. We learn that very many others made the
same mistake, so that we erred in company.
DR. LOVELL-KEAYS
It is with deep regret that we record the death, on May 14, of our
esteemed colleague, Dr. Lovell-Iveays. Ilis serious illness, already noted
in the Magazine, manifested itself just as he had once more consented
to become Treasurer as well as Secretary of the Society, and few of
those who saw him at the Council Meeting in January would have
supposed that we should so soon have to mourn his loss.
Dr. Keays was a fine naturalist, with a special enthusiasm,
amounting to a veritable gift, for aviculture. He enriched the Magazine
before the War with many valuable papers, and his writings under the
name of " Secretarius " are masterpieces of applied knowledge. He was
a Waterton of ornithology, an able and reliable interpreter of the book
of Nature who did not hesitate to share his great knowledge with others,
but freely shared his experiences with all. Now that aviculture has
revived and the Magazine is definitely set once more on its former course,
his counsel and assistance will be sadly missed.

By S. C. Law, M.A., B.L.
(Kindly communicated by I)r. Chalmers Mitchell)
Partial or wholesale albinism is often met with among the Thrushes
and Starlings, but it is rare among the Bulbuls. About a month ago
a live specimen of the latter class was brought to me for sale by a bird-
catcher, who told me that he had caught it very young in its nest
within a village in the district of Patna. It was found in the nest along
with another youngster, which retained the usual black colour of its
parents. I asked my painter, Mr. J. C. Banerjee, to draw a coloured
likeness of the bird, a copy of which is appended hereto. From this it
is clear that the plumage has become perfectly white, but in between
the feathers about the ears a rosy tint belonging to the flesh has added
to its beauty by mixing with the whiteness of the feathers. The
yellowish-rosy bill, red eyes and nostrils, and dull reddish legs and feet
are perceptible as the concomitants of albinism, while the usual red vent,
characteristic song, and general demeanour show it at the very first
sight to be none other than our daily companion of the field and garden
--a variation of the Black Indian Bulbul.
In the opinion of the bird-catcher, the specimen is different from the
Bengal Bulbul (Molpastes bengalensis), and is the offspring of the

species abounding outside Bengal. According to his statement, there-
fore, it should be Molpastes hcemorrhous (otherwise known as the Madras
Bulbul), which is distinguished from the Bengal Bulbul by the absence
of the conspicuous brown ear-coverts, and by the black of the occiput
and nape, which ends abruptly instead of passing down to the upper-
most portion of the back. Interbreeding, however, between two
closely allied forms, and more specially between Moljmstes hcemorrhous
and Molpastes bengalensis, is so common that no conjecture as to the
ancestry of the albino specimen (i.e. whether it is descended from a pure
form, viz. Madras or Bengal parents only, or the product of interbreeding
between two closely allied species) can be hazarded. In the specimen
before us there is, however, no peculiar ear-covert to indicate its Bengal
origin, though, as I have already pointed out, a rosy tint of the flesh
is visible through the white feathers about the ears and lores.
A PET COCKATOO
By E. Maud Knobel
In the middle of April last I was lucky enough to obtain from
Gamage the most charming pet in the way of a bird I think I have ever
possessed. I have kept birds all my life, and have had all sorts. At
the early age of two years old I was given a pair of Doves, and from them
have ranged from Canaries to Finches (British and foreign) on to
insectivorous birds, also British and foreign--the first being Black-
birds and Thrushes, and later on Shamahs and Tanagers, these, again,
being replaced by Parrakeets and Parrots, and since 1910 I have
practically kept only Parrots. My birds are my friends and companions,
and I have never kept them as anything else. To get a bird to place
absolute confidence in me and never to have the slightest fear has
always been my great object. I have had many charming and delightful
pets, but none, I think, to equal the subject of this paper.
" Jackie " is a small Cockatoo, similar to the Lesser Lemon Crested
(Cacatua sulpliurea), but considerably smaller than the usual specimens.
The B.M. catalogue puts the total length as 13 inches ; this bird
measures about 10 inches, yet I think he is quite adult and he certainly

lias not grown at all since I have had him. He is white, with the usual
lemon crest, and if you turn back the feathers of the head and neck
the down feathers underneath are a bright canary yellow. The under
wings and tail are pale lemon colour. The bright yellow patch on the
ear-coverts, so conspicuous in most of the Lesser Sulphur Crests, is
wanting, and there is only a suspicion of very pale lemon colour to mark
the spot. He has black eyes, and is certainly a male bird.
I was told he had come from the Solomon Islands, and had only
been a few days in this country when I bought him. He certainly must
have lived in the engine-room on the boat coming over, or been petted
by men with oily hands, for he was almost black and covered in oil.
I have washed him twice in " Lux ", and also rubbed him with flour
and oatmeal, but without much success ; the quills are white, but it
seems almost impossible to get the oil out of the soft, downy feathers,
and I suppose I must possess my soul in patience and wait for him to
moult out into that snow-like whiteness that one wants to see. He is
far and away the most amusing and intelligent bird I have ever had.
He is a perfect clown in the way he plays about and talks and dances
the whole day through. He enters a room as if the whole place belonged
to him, and then pauses to see who he shall go to ; having made up his
mind he then runs straight to that person and pulls himself up to be
nursed. He generally chooses my mother, to whom he is devoted.
He has learnt several words since I have had him, like " Jackie ",

cackle to perfection like a hen after laying an egg. He is never tired of
sitting on a chair in front of a looking-glass, when he kisses and talks
to himself in the most endearing terms. He sometimes does a kind of
skirt dance in the corner of the room--slowly dancing round with wings
outspread, and now and again tapping the floor with his beak, and then
putting the wings forward so as to completely cover the head. I have
never kept a Cockatoo before, so all this is entirely new to me, but
I should like to know if they all go on like this ! He plays just like
a kitten with a screwed up piece of paper, tossing it over his head with his
beak and pulling it back with his foot. He can run at a tremendous
pace, and follows me about like a dog, jumping down the stairs and then

pulling himself up again by the edge of the carpet (not very improving
to the carpet).
A few days after I had him we had friends to tea, and Jackie came
to the drawing-room to be introduced, and was duly nursed and admired
by all. When the time came for their departure I put Jackie on his
stand and left him alone in the room as we all went to the hall to see
them off. When I returned there was no Jackie. I called and hunted
for him, and then found that he had solemnly walked upstairs to find
me in my bedroom. I had only had him a week and he had not been
to the hall since he arrived, but had lived in my room and the drawing-
room, so I suppose he naturally went there as the only other room he
knew. He is absolutely tame, and loves to be nursed and petted and
played with. When he wants to show great affection to me he not
only kisses me but takes my fingers and combs them down with his
beak in the most extraordinary way. I think his attraction is greatly
enhanced by his small size--he is unlike any Cockatoo I have ever
seen, and I can find no description of him in any book and should
very much like to know if he is a distinct species or simply a freak.

In former years a pair of the large grey-coloured Crested Screamers
(Chauna) lived in the Zoo, and later on bred in the large aviary near
the Clock Tower. The nest was on the ground, being a flattened
structure of hay and straw, supplied with some leaves by the keeper,
and was about 3 or 4 feet in diameter. Two eggs were laid, which
resembled in colour those of a normal British Pheasant. Both sexes
shared in incubation, and usually changed about midday, both then
uttering their loud trumpet-like scream. As on several occasions I saw
the Screamer, which was walking about at the time, begin to scream for
no obvious reason, and the other bird reply with a scream while still
on the nest, I cannot possibly agree with the remarks in the Royal
Natural History, vol. xiv, p. 362, where their powerful voice is referred

to as " a scream of alarm ", line 8. Moreover, after the young were
hatched and had left the nest I went close to a chick to inspect it,
and both parents came at me with outstretched wings and showing
their spurs, but there was no sound uttered by either as they would
have done had the scream been one of " alarm ", for it was clear that
both parents regarded their young one as in danger. At other times,
when not nesting, the pair used to scream at intervals, this being
obviously nothing more than an outburst of pleasure; so that it does
not seem that the cry of the species, as a whole, can properly be called
one of " alarm
But to return to the chicks: they appeared downy within twenty-
four hours of hatching, with red legs like their parents, certainly when
eight days old (if not earlier), and as they grew gradually feathered
into slate-grey with a black ring round the neck.
An interesting attempt to hatch out a chick was made by two
Black Vultures (Catharista at rata ), which were the last survivors of
a large family---about thirty, from what I saw of them--which reached
the Zoo at the time when Bertling was head-keeper.
As attempts which " just fail " are not always recorded, it may be
mentioned that these two were finally put into one of the cages between
the path over the tunnel and the Small Mammal (Cats, etc.) House,
and the female deposited an egg on the ground in a further corner,
there being (so far as could be seen) only a depression scratched in the
earthen floor for the egg. On this she sat regularly (so far as I could
discover, the male took no part in incubating), and looked as if she would
hatch off. Unfortunately the roofing over the nest had been damaged
and only temporarily repaired with network, which did not matter
so long as the weather remained fine ; but just before what seemed to
be the full period the weather turned terribly wet, and drenching rain
came through the opening in the roof on to the Vulture, which stayed
on its nest for more than two days, drenched through, after which it
deserted, apparently unable to tolerate the heavy rains. This change
of weather was unfortunate, because the egg, which was white, had the
chick full-grown inside it, and would apparently have hatched off in
another twenty-four hours. This I saw myself, as it was broken open
after an attempt had been made in the incubating-room to hatch it.

It is a long time since I have handled a pen in order to write
on my birds or anybody else's, and even now I can but wander
somewhat promiscuously amongst them as the spirit moves me.
Monsieur Delacour has more than anyone kept the fire of aviculture
burning within me, he whose enthusiasm is ever undimmed, ever
active. I was with him in Paris not long ago. Whither did we
wend our way ? To Notre Dame, to Versailles, the Louvre, and
all the other wonders of the great capital ? No ! To the chauffeur
we said, " Quai de la Megisserie," to Travella, where good birds
can be found. I was on my way to Italy, and wanted to take
something that would sing. Owing to the War--and what is not ?--
there were few birds that were extraordinary, but I took away
a lovely mule, Hooded Siskin x Canary, and another, Linnet X Canary,
And then when I was in Milan, having to buy bird-seed, I resorted to
the only bird shop I could find, ordered the seed (at a preposterous
price!) and saw that the birds in the shop were quite plebeian. When
the proprietor said, " Would the signore like a Cardellino-Canarino
mule ? " i.e. Hooded Siskin, I answered that I had one. Where did the
signore buy it ? " From Travella in Paris." Tapping his chest, he
said, " That came from me." I had brought the bird back to its original
dwelling ! and I took the other, which was carefully kept upstairs
away from the common herd.
These Hooded Siskin mules are charming songsters and extremely
handsome, looking like a pure species, or not unlike a refined green
Canary, colour fed, and very successfully coloured too, so that the
orange has flowed throughout, the whole underparts being especially
rich and brilliant. I was offered a female, but as she couldn't sing, and
I presume would not propagate her race, I declined with thanks.
As a rule cross breeds do not appeal to me, but these particular ones
are an exception.

I regretted that no opportunity was given me when at the Lake of
Como to see a very interesting sight. 1 happened to visit the iron-
smith at Varenna this spring, where I saw a beautiful blue Rock Thrush
in a cage, to which I was at once attracted, when the " fabbro " said,
" That is the same bird, signore, that you used to know." 1 had not
seen it for seven years, and it is now nearly thirteen, showing no signs
of old age. Its owner then told me that across the lake, near Menaggio,
there is a man who has tw r o true pairs of this species, and that every
spring one of the females makes a nest in the cage, where a food-vessel
should be, lays her eggs, and last year hatched them, but that owing to
lack of time for procuring insect food on the part of their owner
the young did not survive. This is interesting. The cage is only
a roomy one of open wooden bars.
On my return home in the beginning of June I found four Monaul
chicks and one Satyr Tragopan--the little Tragopan most delightfully
tame, having as a mother a black Silky, and two Partridge Pekin
Bantams as foster-brothers. When I held a bowl with food the
Tragopan, running at liberty on a lawn, fearlessly stepped into it to
pick out the choicest morsels, and was more tame than the Bantams.
Its colour in the natal down : head rich rufous, upper parts dark rufous,
underparts yellowish-buff. I had left in April, when the male Tragopan
was daily displaying, an astonishing sight. One moment one sees a
beautiful Pheasant of rich Venetian red thickly spotted with white,
the next, if he is facing you, something out of a pantomime, some
heavenly demon, if such a being could be. Astonishing ! Emerald-
green horns erected, gular wattle covering the bird's front, a wattle of
vivid brilliant turquoise and emerald-green, patched with rose, leaving
one holding one's breath ! In some ornithological publications, whose
authors should have known better, male Tragopans represented in
coloured plates show the fleshy horns on the head ; which except
during the moment of display one scarcely ever sees, and then but the
mere tips ; and also the gular wattle lowered.
It is evident that merely skins of birds have been used by the
artist, for after death the horns and wattle collapse and hang down.

Furthermore, the colours of both have faded, and have been repro-
duced in this state, giving no idea of the brilliance in the living bird.
And then the whole of this wondrous colouring disappears, and once
more there is a red spotted Pheasant walking quietly about. One
rubs one's eyes ; one wonders " Have I got them ? " The trans-
formation is so complete, so entirely unexpected, before you are aware
of the ways of the creature. I deem it to be one of the most striking
and wonderful displays in all bird life. With the Peacock the feathers
are there, patent to the eye, and so, too, with the Paradise Birds and so
on ; they only have to shake them out or up or sideways, but with the
Tragopans all that beauty is completely hidden. One wonders how that
gorgeously enamelled wattle is tucked away at the throat. And what
a pity that the display lasts no more than about a fortnight; two weeks
out of fifty-two ! For fifty weeks the beauty lies hidden, and when it is
forthcoming you may see it but three or four times for but a minute at
a time, unless you can watch all day. And at other moments during the
courting season--that short, short period--the male Satyr Tragopan
constantly gives vent to his loud weird cry, a cry resembling in part
the miawling of a cat, in part something in distress. " Wa-a-u--
Wa-a-a-u-- " drawn out and repeated some six or seven times, the
bird's mouth being opened more widely each time and to the fullest
extent, as if the effort was great. It slightly reminds me of a Badger's
cry. It is very weird.
My pair of Stanley Cranes is a decided addition to the garden,
especially when the male, full-winged, flies round. If he lands on the
other side of the moat his mate sets off running for all she is worth,
sometimes along the path under the pergola which divides the moat
from the ponds above, sometimes past the windows of the house, over
the stone bridge, and along the paved terrace to the orchard. And then
what happy greetings and pirouetting and dancing, as she rejoins
her mate !
My Cranes have dismally failed to hatch their eggs--that is,
White-necked Australian and Mantchurian. Each pair has a large
meadow to itself and each pair has had eggs, which have been

The Marquess of Tavistock -- "Georgiea Masked Parrakeet 119
constructed a bulky nest of sticks and reeds in a shallow pond, because
(so 1 think) their two eggs have on other occasions always been taken
by some animal [?a stoat] when they were deposited in the open field.
Why the eggs this year have failed to hatch or to be fertile I do not
understand, for the Australians most certainly mated.
The Mantchurians laid for the first time this year, although I have had
them for about ten. No Cranes could be kept under more favourable
circumstances. The White-necked, certainly a true and devoted couple,
have had eggs, and twice each season for the last four years, yet the
eggs are always clear. They sit sedulously. It is puzzling. The birds
are in magnificent condition, and have a spacious range of ground
with water.

By the Marquess or Tavistock
Pyrrhulopsis per sonata is a rare bird in these days ; there are ugly
rumours that he is verging on extinction in his native country, thanks
to some fool who added Mongooses to the local fauna. Anyhow, I have
seen but one -- the subject of this article -- though I believe a few others
have passed through the hands of Australian dealers within the last
six or seven years. The Masked Parrakeet is a big bird, bearing some
superficial resemblance to a '&quot;King", but larger and with a much
heavier beak. The greater part of the plumage is rich green, tinged with
blue in the flights and tail ; the centre of the breast is yellow, becoming
orange on the abdomen ; the bill, forehead, and part of the face are
black ; the eye is fiery orange. " Georgie " has been in my possession
about 18 months. He appears to be very old, and I daresay his former
master kept him for many years. Though always in fair condition, he
has never been really robust, and has had to be nursed through more
than one minor illness. His disposition is most peculiar, and he appears
to be endowed with a dual personality. For long periods he will be dull,
quiet, and sluggish, hardly moving from his perch, uttering no sound
and shrinking away if touched. Then suddenly he completely changes
and becomes active, sociable, full of conversation, and equally full of the

desire to bite somebody. He repeats several words and sentences,
barks, and utters a most disagreeable screech which may be the natural
call, but I am inclined to think has been learned from a Parrot or
Macaw. This summer I decided to give Georgie his liberty, hoping to
rejuvenate him and increase his stamina. So far the experiment has
been a success ; he has conducted himself sensibly, and seems to be
improving in health. He flies heavily and only for short distances ;
he is timid with other birds, and allows smaller Parrakeets to bully
him. When walking he moves in an alert but rather furtive manner,
recalling a Pheasant, and there is none of the ordinary Parrot waddle
in his gait. His food consists of the usual seed mixture with soft fruit
and peanuts, of both of which he is very fond. My other Pyrrhulopsis

human beings, but as far as I have been able to judge more amiable
with other Parrakeets. I hope to mate him with a Sula Island

Quite one of the nicest indoor collections I have seen is that belonging
to our member, Mrs. Burgess, of Helston House, Clifton. At the
invitation of this lady I recently made a special visit, and was struck
by the excellent appointments of her bird room. This room has a central
range of twelve aviaries, each measuring about 12 by 8 by 6 feet,
made with wood framework zinced and kept separate with frosted glass.
The entire bird-room floor was covered with a galvanized sheet to prevent
mice, and additional flight and Parrot cages were arranged round the
walls, leaving a walking space round the room for visitors. The whole,
with feeding-stuff annexe, gives the owner scope for keeping all sorts of
things, whether it be a collection of small birds, breeding pairs of larger
birds, or collections of middle-sized species, augmented by Parrots in
cages. Mrs. Burgess possesses quite one of the largest and healthiest
collections of Blue Budgerigars I have seen, and a large batch of Olive
Budgerigars and Bluebred Greens. Among other Parrot-like birds

I noticed a Cuban Amazon, an excellent Grey, the rare Lesson&apos;s
Amazon, a very tame Rosy Cockatoo, and an interesting mottled
Yellow-fronted Amazon. Apart from being very tame and a talker,
this bird's body plumage was regularly mottled with alternate green
and yellow feathers. 1 There were also Red-collared and Swainson's
Lorikeets, Peach and Red-faced Lovebirds, Meyer's, Senegal, and
Muller's Parrots, Yellow-headed Eops, Jendaya Conures (a remarkably
tame and beautiful pair), Pennant, Stanley, and Rosella Broadtails,
Cockatiels, and White-winged Parrakeets, Blue Grosbeaks, with a dozen
or so Cardinals, making an excellent show: six or eight Virginian cocks
give some colour with Popes and Redcrests. A nice singing Dyal and
a Mocking-bird contributed music to the collection. The lazy denizens
of the aviary were a pair of Cuban Trogons, and red as a colour was again
noticeable in the shape of a batch of Scarlet Tanagers. Besides these
there were noticeable such birds as Yellow-fronted Fruitsuckers,
Javan Hill Mynahs, and a pair of Bifasciated Sunbirds (=the nectar-
feeders). These have been lately augmented by Yellow-winged
Sugar-birds. The small seed-eaters were pretty numerous, and such
birds as Grey and Green Singing and Alario Finches, Cordons, Orange-
cheeks, Fire and Lavender Finches, Grey and Dufresnes Waxbills,
Gouldians, Masked, Longtailed, Grass, Wydahs, Combasous, Diamond,
Black Seed, and Cuban Finches were well to the fore.
Mrs. Burgess feeds her birds in the orthodox fashion, and for a large
collection her death-rate has been so far low ; on the whole her birds
thrive remarkably well, because she does not buy rough or cheap
birds, but pays reasonable prices for selected material. Among the
several Senegal Parrots in her collection I noticed a very fine bird with
tomato-red lower underparts. I have seen several such Senegals
(not colour-fed), but have not possessed one, although 1 have
had a number of these Parrots. 1 have not had occasion to look
up a collection of Senegal Parrot skins for comparison, but it
has just occurred to me whether these red-breasted birds are
the males, as the mating of Senegals with yellow underparts has
jn the instances I have in mind always proved abortive. Perhaps

some member who knows the bird in life in its native state can settle this
point. Mrs. Burgess has recently included a Queen Alexandra Parrakeet
and a King Parrakeet in the collection, and I understand is negotiating

so much their breeding as to have the opportunity of enjoying their

Although I have searched through quite a lot of ornithological
literature I find very little, if anything, about the subject of my notes,
namely, the Cuban Conure ( Conurus euops). These birds have never
been very common in the English bird market, judging from the
sparse references made to them. In the Avicultural Magazine they are
only mentioned once, and that was by Lord Rothschild, who was
comparing them with some newly discovered Conure. I can find
practically nothing about their wild life, and if any reader could give
me any information on the subject I should be greatly indebted to him.
These Conures have not been in my possession very long, but quite
long enough for me to be charmed by their engaging ways and unique
colouring, which, by the way, is the usual Conure green, with scarlet
feathers scattered indiscriminately all over the body except the wings
and tail, the red feathers being denser on the head. In one of the
Conures the head is quite red, which goes to show that the red colour
varies individually. The chief beauty lies in the under-wing feathers,
which are rich scarlet and can only be seen when the birds are in flight,
and then they look much redder than when at rest.
It seems rather a strange thing that such bright colouring should be
hidden under the wing, but one finds examples of this in several of
the Psittacidae. Perhaps this colouring is used in the display of the
bird, but Parrots, I think, don't usually indulge in displays; they do
their courting as we humans do, by kissing and fussing round.
Is Conurus euops in a transitional state of evolution, either assuming
certain areas of red plumage or losing them ? It seems so strange that

birds should have such a bright colour scattered in such patchwork
fashion over the body without having it in certain restricted areas.
Perhaps they are assuming a green plumage for better protection.
The Conures when first they came were very wild and in very poor
plumage, now they are in very much better feather and much tamer,
but it will need a moult to do them justice. In size these birds are
somewhat larger than the Brown-throated Conure, perhaps a little
sturdier in build. The only difference I notice as regards the sex is
that one of them seems to have a much larger beak and flatter head
than the other. 1 thought that this was the hen, but a Grey-breasted
Parrakeet in the same aviary, which I feel sure is a hen, became very
friendly with this Conure, feeding it and preening its feathers, and it
would have killed the supposed cock Conure had I not been there in
time to save its life. These birds seem only to feed on apple and
sunflower-seed, all other fruit they refuse or eat very little of; they
soon get through a good-sized apple, but only eating about half and
wasting the other part.
They are very noisy birds, not that they screech, but chatter loudly
all day long, though the noise is not very unpleasant -- not one that
neighbours would complain about. I regret to say that these Parrakeets
are very destructive to w T oodw r ork, which P am afraid is the family
failing of nearly all the Psittacidse, for although I supply them with
heaps of bark and partly decayed wood, they seem to prefer to try and
demolish the aviary. It is a strange thing to see these birds, quarrelling
violently and fighting with beak and claw, suddenly stop and commence
to preen each other&apos;s feathers and feed each other.
As is too often the case with Parrakeets brought from American
regions, these birds had their flight feathers cut and so were unable to
fly, and being very lively birds, always on the move, they sometimes
overbalanced when running along a branch, and came with a thud to
the floor. I was very much afraid that they w r ould do themselves
some internal injury, so I went into the country, fetched a car-load
of dry bracken from out of the woods by the roadside, and spread this
on the floor to help to break their fall. When they fell down they
stayed as if dazed for a minute or two, and then ran up the wires
and were as lively as ever in a very short time.

The Conures have taken over the entire management of the concern
and keep all the other birds at a distance ; a Yucatan Jay seems to be
a special aversion of theirs and gets driven from pillar to post all day,
although he is twice their size. I am hoping that they will breed, as
I do not think that they have been bred in England before.
Just one final word as regards the feeding of Parrots. I attribute
any success that I have had with them to the fact that they get a
plentiful supply of fruit every day all the year round. One cannot
expect Parrots, whose natural food is ripe fruit, corn, and grass in the
ear, to thrive on dry seeds, which are too often covered with dust.
I also give a plentiful supply of bark, which I gather in the country
every week off dead trees ; willow-tree bark is the best, and it is the
easiest to pull off the trees. I have brought several ailing Parrots into
perfect condition by giving them a liberal supply of bark to bite up ;
it gives the birds something to do instead of moping in their cages
all day long. It is bad enough for them to be imprisoned at all, but it
is much worse for them to have nothing to do. The greatest thing in
keeping birds is not to try and see what is the lowest temperature
at which a bird can be kept alive, or what is the plainest food upon
which it can exist, but to keep the captive while it is under our care
as near as possible to ifl^ natural state, both as regards temperature
and food, and to make its life as happy as possible under the
circumstances.

This interesting Finch, which is nearly the size of our Redwing,
was first bred by Dr. M. Amsler in 1915, an account of which appeared in
Bird Notes the same year. Dr. Amsler after his first success allowed the
birds freedom once they had gone to nest, thus securing for the
nestlings a larger supply of insects than the parents would have been
able to procure within the limits of the aviary walls. Some fine
youngsters were reared in this way, a pair of which I secured. These
wintered out of doors very well, but to my disappointment they did
not go to nest in the spring, and I am inclined to think that they were
two hens. However, one died, and I sold the survivor, so I was unable
to prove this. Last autumn Dr. Amsler offered me his original pair
and I was very glad to have them. About the middle of April this year
the hen built a neat nest of roots and twigs and lined it with hair ;
two large eggs, pale bluish-green and thickly marked with brown,
were laid. These 1 took for my collection. The hen went to uest again
at the beginning of May, this time in a black spruce. Incubation com-
menced on May 4, the number of eggs again being two. On March 17
both had hatched, making the incubation period thirteen days. All

126 W. Shore Baity--The Nesting of the Orchard Finch
went well for a week, when on the very day I started for a short
Whitsun holiday the cock escaped from the aviary, and my man was
unable to capture him. In spite of this disaster the hen kept on feeding
the young, and on my return I found that one youngster had left the
nest on May 27. Up till this time no soft food or mealworms had been
provided, but now that the cock had gone and all the work of feeding
was left to the hen I started handing out mealworms, and very soon the
hen would come at call and take them from my hand. The second
young bird left the nest on the last day of the month ; it was then
quite well feathered. For a week things went excellently, when one
morning I found one of the young dead, the skull having been fractured,
possiblv from an attack by another bird. The survivor thrived, and is
now as big as its mother and quite independent. I hope that it may
turn out to be a cock. Writing of their species as found in Patagonia,
Mr. W. H. Hudson says :--
" This is a pretty and elegant bird, though possessing no bright
colours. They go in pairs in the warm season, but in winter unite in
flocks, often of two or three hundred individuals, and have a graceful
undulating flight. On being approached they utter a series of low,
ticking notes, and occasionally a long squealing cry. The male has also
a verv agreeable song, which continues at all hours, but on cold or windy
days only at sunset. The bird usually soars from his perch and utters
his song when gliding down with wings depressed and tail outspread.
When I first heard it I was startled with its wonderful resemblance
to the song of the Correndera Pipit (Anthus corendera); it is, however,
shorter and more powerful
Mr.H.Durnford,a1sowritingof this bird (Proceedings of the Zoological
Society), says : " It is common at Chupat throughout the spring and
summer, and was often seen during our journey in the valleys ; it never
wanders far from water. On September 20 I took a nest on the
hills near the Colony; it was a very neat structure of wool, feathers,
and the flowers of a grass, and placed in the centre of a thick bush,
about a foot above the ground. It contained two eggs of a pale green
colour, thickly mottled with dull chocolate spots and streaks."

Textbooks invariably mention the Pilot Bird as being rare, but in
the dense, scrubby gullies of the Dandenong Ranges (Victoria) they may
often be seen by the keen observer who knows where to look and what
to look for. Their comparative silence and unobtrusive habits render
their detection difficult until such time as the observer learns to recognize
the quiet call and the class of country which they frequent.
The writers visited the ranges many times before the birds were
noticed, but since making their acquaintance numbers have been
seen and several nests located. The bird is to a great extent a ground-
lover, very rarely flying, and if forced to take wing flies low, never higher
than a foot or two. They travel on the ground as a rule, and their
rapid passage through the undergrowth makes them very difficult to
follow. We have on one or two occasions seen the birds perch on a
shrub, but only at a height of 2 or 3 feet. Their food consists
of beetles, worms, and small freshwater mussels, which are found in
the damp gullies of these Ranges. The birds are very local in habit,
never moving far from one particular spot.
Our first nest of this species was discovered quite by accident.
We were scrambling down the side of a dense scrubby gully at Olinda
with some bird-lover friends, when one of the party, while stepping
over a log, kicked against a tangle of dry bracken ; instantly a loud
clamouring arose, and on searching we discovered a dome-shaped nest
containing two fine, unfledged youngsters. The nest was quite new
to us all at that time, so we waited for the adult birds to appear. The
female arrived first, after some considerable time, but we were still in
the dark as to what species the bird belonged. It was not until
we arrived at the camp and consulted Dr. Leach&apos;s Australian Bird
Book that we discovered what our find was. This bird was very tame
on arriving at the nest with food for the young, and proceeded to feed
them without taking the slightest notice of our party, who were sitting
only a few feet distant. We stayed by the nest while we had lunch,
and the birds became so tame as to take bread from our hands. We

The Nesting of the Pilot Bird
decided before we left that as the birds looked such promising subjects
for the cameras, we would devote the next day to photography. We
arrived at the nest early next morning, and the birds, as before, were
hand tame. Their habit, however, of bringing food only once in
20 minutes or so did not give us many opportunities for exposures,
especially as they fed the young and departed quickly. We finally
tried an old scheme of ours, which as a rule proves effective with dome-
shaped nests. We blocked the entrance up with paper. The parents
on arrival were rather surprised, but it served our purpose well, keeping
them around the nest looking for the opening. From this on we had
unlimited opportunities during the day, but owing to our inexperience
with the cameras at that time the results were rather poor, the two
photographs reproduced being the total of many plates exposed. We
greatly regretted the fact that this was the last day of our stay, as we
would have liked to have devoted more time to the study of these
interesting birds.
We located our next nest at Ferny Creek, in the same district, the
following season. It was built at the base of a clump of sword-grass,
a common situation for these birds to choose, and contained two
eggs. It was only after considerable time and patience were expended,
however, that we succeeded in tracking the birds to their nest. They
had not commenced to sit, and we had to give up the idea of photo-
graphy until a later period. We visited the nest when the young had
hatched, and as in the previous case the visits of the parents with food
were some distance apart. The weather on this occasion was very
doubtful, being inclined to rain, a by no means uncommon occurrence
in this district at any time of the year, as we have frequently found
to our cost. Indeed, it always seemed to us to rain in these parts when
we had some interesting subject on hand. Of course, with our simple
apparatus dull weather is fatal, sunlight being necessary for the short
exposures we make.
We found, as before, it was necessary to close the entrance of the
nest to keep the parents close by. The food for the young on this
particular occasion was large moths, and it was most amusing to see
how indignant the adults were when they found they could not get to
their chicks with food. They got so taken up with trying to find the

entrance that they forgot the presence of the cameras and ourselves
entirely. When we picked some of the moths out of the female's bill
she angrily snatched them back ! We were greatly astonished, and
wished we had some of our friends present to witness this remarkable
tameness in wild birds. Unfortunately the photographs taken were
very much under-exposed, and the rain coming on heavily we had a wet
two miles' tramp to the hut.
The breeding season for the birds extends from August to December,
and occasionally later. The nest is built on the ground or very low down
in a clump of sword-grass or dead bracken. It is a dome-shaped
structure, built of strips oibark, bracken, and gum-leaves. A platform
composed of sword-grass stems and twigs appears before the entrance.
The eggs, which are two in number, are very beautiful, being light
chocolate varying to olive-green.
It is said by some that the Pilot Bird derives its name from the fact
that it is frequently found in close proximity to the Lyre Bird. It
certainly inhabits the same class of country, and we ourselves have
heard the Lyre Bird calling close by when we have been operating at

The Buzzard at Home. By Arthur Brook. With twelve photo-
graphic plates. London : Witherby &amp; Co. 3s. 6 d. net.
This is one of those valuable little booklets which fortunately are
increasing in number evqry year. All the information contained in it
has been acquired at first hand, and Mr. Brook tells his story with
simplicity and restraint. The twelve plates illustrating the text are
full of life and movement, and for that reason are far more interesting
than more technically perfect photographs of a motionless bird ever
could be.
Only a bird photographer can adequately appreciate the difficulties
Mr. Brook had to contend against. The nest was unusually inaccessible,
and the choice of a suitable spot for the camera limited in consequence.
Mr. Brook calls attention to two traits in the Buzzard's character,
which have always been of interest to naturalists. They are harmless,
and confined to the adult birds. Some instinct, purely decorative as
far as we can judge, induces them to embellish their nest with freshly
plucked branches of larch or mountain ash.
The second trait points to something peculiarly sinister in the
young Buzzard's nature. The oldest and strongest nestling will
savagely attack and devour his weaker brethren. Many young
Raptores are destroyed more or less accidentally in the nest when there
is a marked difference in their ages ; but only the young Buzzard
habitually bears the hall-mark of Cain, and with his brethren inside
brazenly faces his accuser and cynically asks : " Am I my brother's
keeper ? "
The most interesting point in this little monograph is the
nursery diet as supplied by the parents. The menu is a varied one,
and consists of young Ducks, Moles, Frogs, Mice (including Shrews),
and small Rats. Unfortunately Mr. Brook's records did not begin until
the nestlings were about ten days' old. The careful way in which all

attractive things about them.
This booklet errs on the side of brevity ; to wish there was more

FULL CIRCLE: REVIVED AVICULTURE
Dear Dr. Renshaw, --I heartily approve of the new policy of
returning to purely avicultural matters, and I think that most of our
members will do so too. It will be good to get our Magazine back to
its old form, and though it will make those who, like myself, are still
debarred from keeping birds feel sorely envious, I hope we shall hear
of many breeding successes. I see that Yellow-winged Sugar-birds are
again obtainable; perhaps some lucky person will succeed with them
now. -- Yours sincerely,
Ethel F. Chawner.

avicultural articles, as one of the most valuable aspects of such a Society
as ours is to put on record the behaviour of any given species during
the whole period of incubation and the rearing of the young in a way not
possible, at any rate, in the majority of foreign species in the wild
state.--Sincerely yours,
T. H. Newman.
Dear Dr. Graham Renshaw, -- There is a pretty general
feeling among members that it would be an advantage if the
Magazine could contain a greater proportion of definitely avicultural
articles. I should like to support this, as I feel that the success of
a publication like ours depends largely upon the preservation of its
original character. Observations on foreign birds in a natural state are
often interesting and helpful, but notes on common British birds we
do not want unless the observer has really got something original
to record. -- Yours truly,
Tavistock.

The late Sir Alexander Baird
Dear Sir,--I have been interested in reading your editorial remarks
in this month's Magazine, and note the change of policy which has been
decided upon. May I express the opinion that the change will be
decidedly for the best. With every wish for continued success,--
Yours faithfully,
J. J. Cash.
The annual meeting, by kind permission of the Zoological Society,
will be held at the Zoo on July 23. Members will meet at 4 p.m. at the
Old Refreshment Rooms.
THE LATE SIR ALEXANDER BAIRD
By the death in Cairo of Sir Alexander Baird the Society loses an
old and valued member of sixteen years' standing and a keen
aviculturist. Owing to the War and for reasons of health the last years
of his life have been almost entirely passed at his beautiful house at
Matarieh, near Cairo, where he had many aviaries and a nice collection
of birds, which it was always his pride and pleasure to show to anyone
who was interested. Apart from his love of birds and natural history,
he was a man of wide sympathies and will be mourned not only by
a large circle of friends in this country and Egypt but also by many
Egyptians--both rich and poor--by whom he was regarded as the true
type of a British gentleman.
J. L. Bonhote.

The Magazine has rocketed from its parochial status to become the
leading cage-bird journal in the world. Amid the general havoc of
the War, when natural history journals went down like ninepins, it
held a steady course, guarded and guided. To-day it is alive
and up to date, a valuable property. Outside contributors write
for it, the general public takes it in; private letters from all over the
world voice the esteem in which it is held. Across the Atlantic not
only has the Press of America described it in most gratifying terms, but
a journal of high standing has published reprints from its pages. It has
become a standard periodical, a work of reference consulted far beyond
the circle of the Society. Its success is attributable to the high standard
of its articles and the interest of its illustrations ; its record of
achievement is high.
An interesting announcement will be found on the last page of
this issue.
The Editor will no longer tolerate the behaviour of a certain
section of the Society.
Passing to more important matters, the Editor is now a " free
lance " and invites suggestions for the future. There is room, for
example, for a new natural history journal, which would go like
wildfire.

(Continued from p. 119.)
I have mentioned that four young Monauls were hatched in May
under a Rhode Island Red (one of which, when six weeks old, was killed
by a rat, I believe the only female in the brood), and I was very
astonished in the second week of July when the parent Monaul appeared
in her aviary with five more chicks. I did not know she was sitting
in the roosting-house amongst some bracken litter on the floor. I had
been in Italy, and my bird keeper hid the fact from me in order to
give me a surprise, in which plan he most admirably succeeded. I was
approaching the aviary with a friend, when the latter exclaimed,
" Oh, look at the little ones ! " What little ones ? "--" Why, the
little pheasants." There was the pair of Monauls leading about five
chicks, the hen bird digging for all she was worth for worms. Last year
she incubated a second clutch of eggs, but deserted them the day before
they hatched, and fortunately the eggs were conveyed in time to a
farmyard hen, who had been broody for a fortnight or more, and duly
hatched. Sitting on her nest in the dead bracken the Monaul was
almost completely camouflaged, and she sat perfectly steady whilst
matutinal cleansings on the part of the aviary keeper were taking place.
The aviary is by no means a large one; the flight is about the size of one

of the smaller enclosures of the western aviary at the London Zoological
Gardens, the roosting-house being but 8 feet square. I do not know
if Monauls have incubated and hatched their young on previous
occasions in captivity. There are Doves and Parrakeets in the same
enclosure, which is by no means a quiet retreat. The hen Monaul
has laid nine eggs these last two seasons respectively. Had she been
in a spacious grass enclosure with trees and shrubs I should not have
been so surprised. She seems to promise to rear her young successfully.
The male, usually quiescent by the middle of July, displayed to her,
in spite of faded plumage ; no doubt inspired by pride in the presence
of a complete family circle.
My Ducks have hatched off broods, but the Ducklings all die or
disappear within a few days, and I failed to find the eggs in the nests.
There was a fine brood of nine Rosybills, some Chiloe Widgeon and
Tufted Ducks, and also three Bar-headed goslings, which I particularly
hoped to save. A stoat must have taken them.
My beautiful Golden-naped Woodpecker (Chrysophlegma flavinucha)
flourishes, although he all but accomplished the opposite. I brought
him to show a friend. The bird was on my shoulders, and I foolishly
failed to notice that one of the windows was slightly open. The wood-
* pecker took fright, flew round the room, and just happened to slip out.
That was on a Saturday. On the following day someone saw him in an
orchard about half a mile from the house, but I was not informed of the
fact until the Monday, when I went to search. My friend, in the mean-
while, on leaving that morning turned to me as he said good-bye, and
added, " Your Woodpecker will be found before the day is out." That
afternoon a small boy -- a boy scout--appeared with a basket in which
was the Woodpecker in an apparently moribund condition. It had been
discovered at the foot of a tree about two miles away. I placed the
poor bird near the kitchen fire, gave him a little milk fortified with
a touch of brandy, and after looking as if he would succumb any minute
he so far recovered in a couple of hours as to be able to eat. In two
days he was quite himself again, and evidently very delighted to be
safely home. He had been unable to find food, in spite of having
been at large in a thoroughly " woodpeckery " country.
I suppose him to be the only specimen of his kind in Europe. A

native of the Himalayas, ho is about the same size as our Green Wood-
pecker. The nuchal crest (extending to the nape of the neck)
resembles the helmet of a Greek warrior of ancient days, and is a
brilliant golden yellow. The back is green, the flights chestnut barred
with black, tho underparts olive grey-brown. But a sketchy description,
I realize !
He loves cheese, and if anything is held a couple of inches away
outside his cage his long pink tongue is protruded through the bars,
quivering and slithering all round the object of his research, be it a ring
on a finger, a sleeve of a coat, or anything else. His usual food is an
insectile mixture, but fruit is also welcomed.
My Motrnot still flourishes ; I have had him since July, 1914. He
is very omnivorous in his feeding, and swallows down large shreds of
lettuce and sow-thistle leaves, which may in part account for his
beautiful condition. A mouse skinned and cut up is very welcome.
In July I received what I believe to be a rare importation amongst
Guans. I am not sure of the species. This Guan is the size of a hen
pheasant, with a very slender snake-like neck. The prevailing colour
is black, relieved by a whitish crest and by narrow white streaks on
the shoulders, with a patch of the same colour on the wing-coverts.
The bare skin of the face is pale grey-blue, the bill being the same with
a blackish tip. Legs and feet, red. The tarsi are rather short. The eyes,
which are full, are of a rich burnt-siena brown. The bird is tame, and
decidedly out of the common in colouring and appearance.
I have four British Nightingales, which I keep in cages with deep
sand drawers, placing in them at least an inch of sand, earth, and
cedar litter well mixed together, which is easily raked over every
morning ; so that the birds are able to keep their feet in good condition,
always a matter of importance with Nightingales. In the summer I
keep up a supply of gentles, which are placed in a large bowl of fine
meal until they are perfectly white and clean, and are then thrown into
the sand drawer, where the birds can hunt for them. Wasp grubs are,
of course, most useful. Live food is absolutely necessary for Nightingales
if they are to really flourish. The cocoons of the gentles are excellent
for them. When will mealworms once more be on the market in
available numbers ?

This miserable summer of rain and chilly winds has not been
conducive towards an increase of young birds in outdoor aviaries, at
any rate not in mine. The Queen Alexandra Parrakeets had one
brood, three young being found dead in the nesting-box, when nearly
fully feathered, after a very chilly night in June. I suppose the parent
bird had ceased to cover them. Their crops, however, were full of food.
Since then the old birds have not attempted to nest again, which in
a warm summer they would have done.

By J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
The new Plumage Bill now before Parliament has brought the
question of the farming of Egrets for their plumes 1 to the fore--the
trade stating that plumes from India come from farmed birds, while
other letters have appeared in the daily Press stating that the farms
do not exist. This last statement has, however, been definitely settled
by Dr. C. B. Ticehurst (Bull. B.O.C., vol. xl, 1920, p. 152), who gives
full particulars of these farms as run in India. It may therefore be of
interest to readers of the Magazine to have a few avicultural notes
on Buff-backed Herons in captivity in Egypt 2
Some fifteen or twenty years ago the Cattle or Buff-backed Egret
was one of the most familiar birds in the landscape of Egypt, where
they were to be seen following the plough or standing about on freshly
irrigated land, but by 1908 they had practically all been wiped out by
plume-hunters, who shot them down at their breeding colonies, and in
1912, when by the instrumentality of the late Lord Kitchener a law

was passed granting them absolute protection, their numbers in Lower
Egypt were limited to about 120 pairs in one colony. Major Flower,
of the Zoological Service, took up their reinstatement with energy, and
aviaries to serve as centres of distribution were built in various places,
so that the young when bred might be turned out and form new colonies,
whence it was hoped that Egypt would become repopulated.
To show how a protected species may increase under favourable
circumstances, I may mention that in five years the original colony
had increased from 120 to at least 2,GOO nests ; in addition to which
two fresh colonies had been formed, while in the following year (1918)
at least&apos;four more additional colonies were started.
In captivity these birds thrive well on raw meat, with a certain
amount of small fish at least once a week. They breed freely in con-
finement and as a rule rear their young without difficulty, requiring no
additional food or care as the young are fed by regurgitation from the
parents' crops. At the age of from two to three weeks the young
stand about on the branches near the nest, and chase importunately
any adult bird that settles near them.
In 1914 I determined to try and start a colony in the Giza Gardens,
and procured several young birds, which 1 reared by hand in my
garden. At first I took them when about three weeks' old, with the
result that as soon as they were able to fend for themselves they left me
to seek fresh fields and pastures new, but later on, by taking them two
or three days after hatching, they remained about, and proved delightful
pets, being absolutely tame and fearless of man. For some weeks they
were always about the garden and walked round my breakfast table,
grateful for any scraps they were given, but they gradually reverted
to their wild habits, and would be away all day, returning at 9 a.m. and
4 p.m. for their food, although they would roost in larger trees elsewhere.
Little by little, unfortunately, they would gradually wean themselves,
till after some months they seemed to forget their home, although one
particular bird returned regularly for about two years. It was, though
I regret to say it, only myself that they forgot, for they evidently were
mindful of their original home, and by the end of 1916 had persuaded
many of their kind that a zoological gardens where birds were allowed
at liberty was not a bad sort of place, and by 1917 they decided to fix

upon it as their permanent abode, and some forty pairs settled down
to nest. By 1919 the colony had increased to thousands, and it is one
of the most charming sights to an ornithologist to stand at their roosting-
place any day just before sunset to watch these birds drop in in parties
of eight to fifty, and after circling round in graceful evolutions drop
into the trees, where with much noise the events of their busy day are
eagerly discussed before darkness sends them off to sleep. With but
little imagination one can fancy them, like sportsmen in the smoking-
room after dinner, relating their prowess with large fish or entering
into a heated argument as to the best methods of landing their prey
or the best places where sport is to be got.
In every respect they are most delightful birds and worthy of
much study from both the ornithological and avicultural standpoint.
They are, in religion, undoubtedly sun-worshippers, and our damp,
inhospitable climate does not suit them; none the less they do fairly
well here in captivity, though I doubt if they would be likely to breed.
But if an aviculturist wants a nice tame companionable bird he cannot
do better than keep the Buff-backed Heron.
Most of the remarks in the foregoing article would apply equally
well to the Little Egret, from which the " osprey " plumes are got.
See Astley, A.M., Ser. Ill, Vol. IV, 1913, p. 238, and Vol. VIII, 1917,
p. 323. This species spent the winter of 1918-19 in the Gardens and
at least two pairs remained to breed.

This year I succeeded in getting home a living specimen of Coracias
ncevius, the largest of the Gambian Rollers. He is now in the Zoo.
This prompts me to reprint an account of these birds which I wrote
some years ago, and to add a few further details.
In the Gambia we have representatives of two genera, Coracias
and Eurystomus, which are among the most conspicuous of our birds
on account of the brilliant colours of their plumage, their fearlessness
of man, and the habit, which most of them have, of selecting the top of

a bush or an outlying branch of a tree as a perch from which they can
watch for their prey, and from which they are constantly flying heavily
to the ground, to snap up some locust or other large insect, or perhaps
a lizard or other reptile. At all times they are noisy birds, fond of
uttering harsh croaks and cries, but more particularly is this the case
during the breeding season, when both sexes spend much of their time
sporting and tumbling in the air, courting and lovemaking with many
a scream and buffet. They are commonly known to the English here
as " Jays " or " Blue Jays ", from their general superficial resemblance
to the bird of that name at home. Their native names are Keer-
Kutarong (Mandingo) and Bakhar (Joloff).
Coracias senegalensis. Senegal Roller.
Range. --Senegambia. (ILL.)
This is the commonest Roller in the Gambia, found everywhere and
at all seasons. Although at certain times of the year they are much
sought after by the native hunters for their skins, they are generally
by no means shy birds, though sufficiently cautious and intelligent to
keep at a safe distance from anyone with a gun in his hands. During
the dry season they are comparatively quiet, but from May onwards
they become noisier and more lively, and indulge more frequently in
their rolling, tumbling feats of aerial gymnastics, especially at the
courting season, when they are almost all day sporting in the air together,
at one moment locked in close embrace and grappling one with another,
the next falling like stones, soon to disengage, to rise again and repeat
the same performance, while all the time they are doing their best to
drive one wild with their harsh screaming cries. At all times they are
rather quarrelsome and attack boldly any bird, be it Hawk or other
murdering ruffian, which may trespass on what they consider their
rights. At bush fires they follow the line of the flames, snapping up
the crippled insects and reptiles, often from out of the very centre of the
fire, and disputing with the Kites and Hawks for the possession of the
choicer morsels. At such times one often sees as many as thirty or
forty together, but on ordinary occasions they are found in pairs or
singly, but wherever one may be in the bush one cannot go far without
at least one Roller being in sight. Their chief colours are brilliant light

outer feather on each side being elongated and tapered. The following
description is that of a full-plumaged adult shot November 23, 1905.
Crown and nape, pale bluish-green with a pale brown forehead and
eye streak ; back and mantle, pale chestnut; lesser wing-coverts,
bright ultramarine blue ; middle coverts, Cambridge blue with a
greenish tinge ; cubitals, chestnut, like the back ; great coverts, clear
Cambridge blue ; basal halves of flight feathers the same ; distal halves,
ultramarine with black inner edges; rump, bright ultramarine;
upper tail-coverts, also ultramarine but with Cambridge blue bases
and narrow tips. The two central tail feathers are, above, greenish-
grey ; the others (except the outer long ones) ultramarine at bases,
Cambridge blue at ends, the amount of light blue increasing from within
outwards ; the external feather on each side (3 |inches longer than the
others) is Cambridge blue with the central shaft and whole of the last
3 |inches black. Below : chin, pale brown ; cheeks and throat, greenish
blue streaked with lighter ; breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts,
clear Cambridge blue ; under surface of tail like the upper, but the light
blue extends rather further ; under wing-coverts, bright Cambridge
blue ; under surface of flights like the upper, but the two blues are not
quite so clear in colour ; bill, black ; legs and feet, greyish olive ; irides,
burnt sienna ; length (to end of middle tail feathers), 12 inches.

The best-known and most distinctive of a multitude of species are
the large Lemon-crested ; the lovely Leadbeater, with delicate pink
tints like crushed strawberries on a white ground, and a splendid
tricoloured crest of scarlet, orange, and white ; and the very common
and cheap Rose-crested bird, with grey body and pale pink head.

scarlet head, from Victoria and parts of Tasmania ; it was mentioned
by Capt. Cook in his journal, and figured by Lesson in 1802. Greatest
of all is the terrific-looking Black Goliath of New Guinea, a rival of the
Hyacinthine Macaw as to mere size among the Psittacidae.
Then we have the very gorgeous Trichoglossi or Lorikeets, and
though they are smaller than the East Indian Lories, and have long
instead of short tails, they follow their habit in being lovers of the honey
of flowers and of rich fruits, and so are not easy to reconcile to our
English fare. The most beautiful are Swainson's Lorikeet ( alias the
" Blue Mountain " Lory), the Ornate Lorikeet, and the Swift Lorikeet.
Another large and charming group are the Platycerci or Broad-tails.
Perhaps the most splendid, and certainly one of the rarest to reach these
shores alive, is the Stanley Parrakeet -- so called after the thirteenth
Earl of Derby, the collector of the most princely private menagerie
ever seen in England, if not in Europe. Another example is the
Pennant Parrakeet, sometimes erroneously called a Lory, glowing with
colour when seen in the sun, ami not inaptly called by its early discoverers
the Purple and the Glorious Parrakeet. Then the brilliant Rosellas
are also Platycerci -- the Rosy, the Pale-headed, and the Yellow-backed.
There are a troop of other beautiful forms, and as a link between this
family and the Lorikeets comes the small genus Polytelis, with three
species, one of which, the Barraband, is quite well known.
Another immense and exquisitely beautiful tribe are the little
Grass Parrakeets. Loveliest among them are the Splendid, followed
closely by the Many-coloured and the Tourquoisine, the Elegant,
Bourke's, and the Red-backed. The last is the most brilliant, perhaps,
but typical of the form of them all. Then there is the quaint Cockatiel,
and least of all the Budgerigar or Undulated Grass Parrakeet; both
these species breed like Sparrows in English aviaries.
The Parrots of New Guinea afford fresh and ever-widening scope
for the study of ornithologists. 1 will only allude to one genus, the
Eclectus ; they are large and handsome birds, though dull and un-
interesting, and have one peculiarity, a striking one. The brilliance
of the female far exceeds that of her mate. While he is of a sober green,
she is clad in wondrous shades of crimson, purple, and orange, which
melt into each other through an indescribable sheen. Considering the

beauty of the Eclecti and the distance they come, they are often offered
at low prices--probably that a sale may anticipate death, for they do
not seem to thrive in captivity, and I do not advise any friends to
invest in them.
The third part of this paper can be easily curtailed ; I mean the
hints upon the treatment of Parrots in captivity, for I have already
much encroached upon it by frequently alluding to the peculiar habits
of each race in describing it. Broadly speaking the Indian Psittacidse
are delicate and not easily acclimatized. Still, there are exceptions
to this rule in the common Ring-necked Bengal Parrakeet and the
Alexandrine, which like most of the Cockatoos are very hardy.
The African Parrots vary--the Grey and the Senegal are victims
too often of the mysterious ship fever of modern times. I am credibly
informed that not more than one in a hundred of the imported Grey
Parrots survives three months. The disease is fearfully infectious and
contagious, and if anyone has the misfortune to lose a Parrot from septic
fever the cage should be at once subjected to heat (there is a place in
London where this can be done) or every occupant of the same species
will infallibly die. It is, however, a curious fact that if a Grey Parrot
has fever, though every Grey or Senegal Parrot in the house will take
it, it frequently happens that Parrots of other species are not affected.
The African Lovebirds are fairly hardy, but will not comfortably pass
the English winter out of doors. All the South American Parrots are
hardy ; most of the Conures and Macaws extremely so. Through the
terrific winter of 1878--9 my friend Mr. Dutton, who lives in a bleak
region of Gloucestershire, had a hen Macaw which persisted in sleeping
in the top of the highest elm-trees ! Morning after morning he whistled
at his bedroom window at sunrise, and down she flew to him.
He expected each morning to be her last, but she survived it all and was
none the worse. I knew a fine aviary at Sharsley Hall, near Bridg-
north, in which a number of the Macaw and Cockatoo families lived for
many years with no heating and only slight protection in winter.
The Australian Parrakeets vary immensely in hardiness. Some of the
Rosellas and the little Budgerigars will pass an English winter out of
doors with impunity, while the Euphema tribe would probably soon
succumb.

I beg humbly to apologize for the length of this address, and only hope
that it may enable you to take a fresh interest in any of this exotic
tribe, which you may see either alive or portrayed. Surely a feathered
race endowed with such singular powers, both of brain and voice, was
not created without purpose, but was intended for the delight and
sometimes for the solace of the human race.

Mr. Walter Goodfellow, who is well known to members of the
Avicultural Society as a great traveller who has imported some of the
rarest of foreign birds in years gone by, has been spending the last
few years in managing a plantation in Bolivia, a most out-of-the-way
part of the world with a very bad climate. Although thoroughly used
to tropical climates, he has suffered much, though when I met him in
the Zoological Gardens the other day he seemed to have quite recovered.
He consoled himself for the lack of fellow white men by collecting
around him native beasts and birds, and brought a few home, some of
which I understand have gone to our member Mr. E. J. Brook. To the
Zoological Gardens he presented amongst other things a splendid
pair of small Macaws of a species never before seen in this country.
Ara aureicollis, the Yellow-collared Macaw, a species somewhat like
Illiger's Macaw, but carrying on the nape a conspicuous collar of bright
yellow.

just returned home is Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., who, like Mr. Good-
fellow, would not be happy if he travelled home without some birds.
He brought from the Gambia a beautiful specimen of the White-eared

(Coracias ncevius), some Masked and Vinaceous Doves, and a great
rarity, never before imported, in the form of a specimen of the West

The aviaries at the Zoological Gardens are fast assuming their
pre-War appearance, and may, in fact, be said to bo quite well stocked.
Two most valuable collections have recently been received, one con-
sisting of some two hundred birds from New York, presented by the
Zoological Society of that State, the other from India, brought home
by Mr. E. W. Harper.

The American birds are especially valuable nowadays, since the
exportation of native birds is prohibited in the ordinary course. It is
delightful to again have the Blue-bird, the Bobolink, the Red-winged
Blackbird, and the various species of Zonotrichia, which the Americans
call " Sparrows Some of these are delightful aviary birds, hardy
and beautiful. The White-crowned Sparrow is charming, and so is the
Fox Sparrow, but most of all do 1 like the White-throated Sparrow,
which is of a rich brown colour with conspicuous white throat and eye-
stripes and a spot of bright yellow on each side of the face. The birds
from New York were not all North American ; there were several from
Central and South America : the Double-striped Thicknee of Central
America was represented by a beautiful pair; a Derbian Screamer,
a Northern Boatbill, some Guans, Aracaris, and a Toucan came also,
as well as some Australian species. Altogether it is a splendid collection
and a most generous present.

The Journal of the Museum of Comparative Oology. Santa
Barbara, California.
In the first number of this journal we are informed that the location
of the Museum was chosen chiefly because of the excellence of the
climate of Santa Barbara, its suitability to the preservation of bird's
eggs, and its attraction for numerous visitors from all parts of the
civilized world. The bodies associated with the Museum are indicated
as follows : Board of Visitors, Fellows, Patrons, Members, Patron
Collectors, Field Members, Exchange Collectors, Corresponding
Members, and Authorized Collectors. An evidently excellent portrait
of the late Roland Gibson Hazard, formerly a greatly respected trustee
and honorary curator of the Museum, fronts the first page.
It is proposed gradually to bring together nests and eggs of all
known species of birds, in the interests of science and with the hope that
the study of them may throw light upon the evolution of species and
bird-relationships. Personally we fail to see how such extraordinarily
variable objects (both in form and colour) as are many birds' eggs,
not to mention nests, can possibly demonstrate affinity between bird
species ; but we do think that other points of considerable interest
may be elucidated.
On p. 15 we read : " Variation in nature, its presence or absence,
its range within the limits of a species, and, above all, its causes--these
are the problems to the solution of which comparative oology especially
addresses itself." With this view I concur, and, as 1 pointed out (Avi-
cultural Magazine, 3rd Series, Vol. VII, pp. 193--G), I had reason to believe
that moist heat or its absence had a great influence upon the colouring

and markings of eggs. With this object in view the Museum authorities
have decided that it is necessary to secure a considerable amount of
material, as also to settle the question whether or not the variation is
produced by local conditions. If one turns to p. 11, where there is
a photograph of clutches and single eggs of the Tricoloured Redwing,
it will be at once seen that the Museum is not likely to fail for lack of
material; indeed, one might justly condemn such wholesale acquisition
of eggs, even of a common species, though they were ten times more
variable. (Bee Avicultural Magazine, 3rd Series, Vol. IV, p. 282.)
But just as many clutches are considered necessary to indicate the
variability in one species, so in another we are informed that twenty
sets are prized precisely because they do not vary. We should have
thought that two or three clutches at the outside, accompanied by
a printed statement to the effect that the eggs of this species were not
variable, would have answered the purpose quite as well without making
havoc of so many birds' homes. Of course, we have an English bird whose
eggs exhibit more wonderful variation than any of its relatives, and
might be robbed to an unlimited extent without causing much grief to
most of us, and that is our House Sparrow.

The annual meeting was held at the Zoological Gardens on July 23.
Owing to the lateness of the publication of the July number, only a
small number of members were present, but those who came enjoyed
an excellent tea in the Fellows' Pavilion, when matters avicultural
were discussed, after which the party broke up into smaller sections
and paid visits to the many avian treasures in the Zoo, the Small
Bird House naturally being the centre of attraction.
A meeting of the Council was held on the same afternoon at 3 o'clock,
when various matters concerning the welfare of the Society were
discussed. Chief among these was the necessity of accepting a revised
estimate from the Printers, due to general trade conditions. Owing
to this largely increased cost, the finances of the Society will require
very careful management, and there will be no surplus for illustrations.

In view of the remarks of the late Editor, as published in the
Magazine, and to which the Council took great exception, it became
necessary to find a new Editor. Messrs. Pocock and Seth-Smith very
kindly offered to act as temporary co-Editors pending the appointment
of a permanent successor to Dr. Renshaw. This offer was most
thankfully accepted, and the Council feel sure that members will
loyally support these gentlemen who have stepped into the breach
to give them their Magazine by sending them as copy, notes on their
avicultural experiences.

Sirs,- --Mr. Silver in the last number of the Magazine mentions
a Senegal Parrot " with tomato-red underparts ", and suggests that
these red birds may be the males and the yellow-breasted the females.
I know these birds well in the Gambia, and as far as Senegal is
concerned this is not so. All the birds are yellow-breasted, and the
differences between cock and hen are slightly and merely structural,
the plumages being identical. 1 have seen two of the red-breasted (or
rather, bellied) to which Mr. Silver refers. One, 1 know, came from
Lagos ; it was one of a couple (both alike in plumage) which had lived
in Oxford for many years after its importation some time in the nineties.
The other I saw on board a ship a few years ago. It came either from
Cameroon or Togoland. I have always understood that in that part

Sirs, --A note in the last number was also of particular interest
to me. This was not the one on p. 134, but Mr. Astley's article on his
Hooded Siskin mule.
I have seen a good many of these birds on my frequent visits to the
Canary Islands on my voyages to and from West Africa. A good many
are bred there, especially at Grand Canary, where they are known
as " Mistos ". Misto, of course, merely means hybrid, but these are
The Mistos in the Canaries. The local name there of the male parent,
the Hooded or Red Siskin, is " Cardenal de Caracas ".
I have never had a " Misto ", but have bought several cock Hooded
Siskins, and one year on my way home got two hens, which apparently
are but rarely exported from Venezuela. For Mistos large prices were
always asked, but the average price of cock Hooded Siskins at the
Canaries used to be about a pound. This year, on revisiting the islands
after five years' absence, I find that their prices, like that of all other
birds (and everything else everywhere, for the matter of that) has
soared to #5 or more, though I heard that just as we were leaving two
were being offered (and no takers) at #3, and would probably have been
handed over as the anchor came up for a visible #2 in British silver.
In pre-War days one was almost always sure of seeing plenty of
South American birds at Las Palmas, many of which were very rare,
especially in England, for the boats which brought most of them belonged
to an Italian line running between Northern S. America and Genoa.
This year this trade, which the War stopped, seems to be getting into
its stride again, but at prices which would appear prohibitive, though
with the sailors buying common Canaries at #1, and 4s. each being
asked for the commonest African Waxbill, #5 for a Red Siskin, I suppose,
should not seem dear.

This, usually known here as the Brown-headed Roller, is much less
common during the dry season than the Senegal Roller, but from May
onwards its numbers increase, and during the rains (the breeding season)
up to about the end of the year I think the two species are about equally
common. Their habits, flight, and food are the same as those of their
congenors, and although not possessing the extremely brilliant blues of
the Senegal Roller, they are--with their pale brown heads contrasting
so pleasingly with the rich dark blues of the body--also very handsome
and attractive birds.
Description. --Head, neck, and breast, fawn-brown with silvery
reflections on the crown, over the eyes, and on the chin, so that in some
lights these parts look silvery, in others (especially when seen at a

are streaked with silvery white. Back and mantle, olive brown ;

A rather larger bird than the other two, and by far the most Jay-like
in appearance of the three, for when seen alive at a little distance its
brown upper parts, blue-edged wings, and whitish face-markings give it
quite the look of that bird ; but when examined closely the upper parts
are found to be dull olive, though they look brown--a shade too almost
exactly that of a Jay--in certain lights, while below the colour is
pinkish red streaked with white. In the rains it is very common, while
a few remain with us throughout the year ; it resembles its relations
in habits and diet, but is not nearly such an acrobat on the wing as they
are, and is much less aggressive and noisy. Just before the rains begin,
when all the Rollers are specially excitable and quarrelsome, I have
frequently seen one of these " Jay-like " Rollers being hunted about
by one of the Senegal Rollers. One would have thought from their
relative sizes that the driving would have been the other way. Their
note, too, is not so raucous or quite so unpleasant as that of the others,
and may be almost exactly represented by a repetition of the syllables
" oo-ah, oo-ah

two central tail feathers, dull oily green, the others dull blue with green
edges diminishing in extent from within outwards. Wing-coverts,
clear mauve in bend of wing, gradually merging into the reddish lilac
of the greater coverts ; coverts at carpal joint and edge of the wing
ultramarine ; wing-quills, duller blue, shading into black at inner edges.
General colour below, pinky brown streaked with white ; chin shows
a few whitish feathers ; throat, sides of neck, breast, and sides, brown
with distinct white streaks, the latter getting broader and more diffuse
towards the abdomen, which is more pinky brown with hardly any
indication of streaks ; thighs, dull mauve ; under wing-coverts, pale
reddish, merging into whitish ; under surface of flights, whitish with
grey terminal portions. Bill, black ; feet, dirty yellow ochre ; iris,
dark brown ; length, 14 inches.
To this description I should add that I think the white nape-spot
may be a sexual distinction. In one of my two this year's birds this mark
was very slight, in the other larger and more distinct. They are certainly
cock and hen. I got them at Kaiaff, in the South Bank Province,
Gambia, on May 26 last. Some small boys brought them in, saying that
they were " fighting " in the air and had fallen locked together at their
feet and been caught before they could disengage. They were quite
uninjured and in perfect condition, and we may safely assume, I think,
that Venus, not Mars, was the cause of their downfall. I put them
together in a large cage, and commencing with locusts and lizards,
soon got them accustomed to captivity and in time to take raw meat
and fish as well as the natural food. They seemed rather to prefer fish
to meat, and of the latter took beef better than mutton, while neither
would touch chicken or other white meat, though birds' livers, hearts,
etc., were always welcome. The long canoe journey from my province
to headquarters was unfortunately too much for one of the pair, but the
other thrived, and reached the Zoo a day or two ago. It is, I believe,
only the second they have had, the first being one I sent home in
1910. As far as I know these are the only specimens to reach Europe
alive, but on this I wait further information.
Rollers are not exactly good cage-birds nor easy to keep, except
when natural food can be provided. This is quite easy in the African

bush, where lizards, grasshoppers, etc., are abundant, but when it
comes to town life, even in Africa, where such things are not obtainable,
meat has to be the staple diet, and on this they do not do so well, though
when this can be supplemented with cockroaches, mealworms, small
mice, and even small birds, Rollers keep in fair health, and being by
no means timid birds in confinement do not knock themselves about
or spoil their plumage.
The fourth Gambian Roller belongs to a different genus. It is :---
Eurystomus afer. The Broad-billed Roller.
Range .--Tropical Africa. (II.L.)
These are smaller birds than the typical Rollers, and very different
in shape, being built somewhat on the lines of a big-bodied swallow,
with a broad, triangular bill and very wide gape. In the Gambia
they arrive about the beginning of May and commence breeding almost
at once, before the rains set in. This year and once before I have had
young almost full-feathered brought me, but have not been able to
keep them. They lived well enough while crammed with white ants
or other insects, but would never pick up food for themselves, and I
presume that their chief food is small insects caught in flight.
They are usually found in parties of twenty or more ; but I have
frequently seen parties of a hundred or more, especially at the beginning
and end of their stay with us, May and December. They haunt places
where there are large trees, the upper branches of which are their usual
perches, and round the tops of which they float and wheel in the air
like large Swallows, as soon as the cool of the sunset hour approaches ;
they then fill the upper air with their shrill chattering, and continue their
flight far into the night, especially when there is a moon, eventually
retiring to roost in company on the topmost branches of some large
tree. In the mornings, too, before the sun gets hot, one often sees
flocks of them on the wing, but during the heat of the day they are
quiescent. Like the Senegal Rollers their skins have a certain value
to the native hunters, as they fetch 50 centimes at the French ports.
The general colour above is cinnamon brown, the rump and upper
tail-coverts dull blue ; the wings are blue, the lateral tail feathers
bright blue,.shading at the ends into darker blue, while the middle

By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, M.A., F.L.S., M.B.O.U.
Aviculture and bird protection are closely connected, and there is
no more delightful form of aviculture than the encouragement and
study of bird-life in one's gardens and surroundings. By observing
the habits and necessities of species in a wild state the possessor of
kindred species or genera should be able to keep the captives in health
by noticing and recording such things as the changes of foods according
to the seasons of the year. That seed-eating birds, for example, can
only get ripe seed during a portion of the year ; that fruit-eaters can
only procure ripe fruit during a comparatively short time ; that almost
all insect-eaters require fruit at some period of their summer life.
Also with regard to nesting, the kind of site most suitable and the
necessary materials to be supplied for nest-building ; whether or no
a species requires a very retired situation, removed from its own and
other species, or is comparatively indifferent; at what period the
parents change the food given to the young, and to what it is changed.
These and many more important or necessary facts in aviculture can
be found out by careful observation of the wild birds that frequent
our gardens and immediate surroundings.
The length of life to which wild birds attain is very hard to
estimate, and I should be inclined to think that well-kept birds
in confinement certainly live longer than birds in a wild state,
quite apart from the numerous accidents that the latter are always
liable to. It is difficult as a rule to be certain that a wild
bird, unless identified by some peculiarity, is always the same
individual, A Turtle Dove with a stiff leg used to appear about the

and was noticed for twelve successive years. This was undoubtedly
the same bird. A Brown Owl that was caught in a trap and liberated
with a lost foot was found in a dying state thirty-one years afterwards.
This, too, was the same bird. He was well known to our gardeners,
and frequented a certain area near the house. He did not breed for
some years before his death. Since a predatory bird without a foot
must be severely handicapped, I think the long period of thirty-one
years worth recording. A cock Pied Wagtail, with a slightly drooping
shoulder, nested on this house for eight successive years, and survived
the disastrous winter of 1917. He and his mate had three broods each
season, the second brood generally consisting of a Cuckoo ! and the third
brood not leaving the nest till early August. I have known some game-
birds live very long qieriods ; but these are not always under purely
natural conditions. There is a drake Pintail here now, full-winged,
and twenty-one years old, which has led a practically wild life ; he is
nearly tame, and his identity is undoubted. He was the father of a
healthy brood of young this summer. Waterfowl are certainly very
long lived.
It is generally supposed, and I think quite correctly, that when birds
in captivity neglect their young and go to nest again, it is owing to
confinement, and possibly to too good living ; but the same thing
occasionally, though I think rarely, occurs in Nature. A pair of
Moorhens on a garden pond here hatched a second brood in early June
of this year; some of this batch were, as usual, taken over by
members of the first brood, but when they were about a week old
the cock first and then the hen refused to feed the young, and when
the latter followed, crying for food, would turn on them savagely
and give them violent pecks. I saw the hen kill one and eat its
brains, and, strange to say, soon afterwards offer food to another !
Eventually all but one were killed by the parents, who went to nest
again at once and treated their third brood in a proper manner.
So much has already been written about nesting-boxes, etc., that
there remains little more to be said. Indeed, I believe I wrote an
article on the subject some years ago, but much interesting information
can be obtained from them. In the summer of 1917, the result of the

disastrous winter and early spring was very apparent in the nesting-
boxes. We have large numbers in our woods round here. Of course,
the Great Tit and Blue Tit are the predominating species that occupy
them in most years, but in 1917 the Blue Tit was entirely absent
and the Great Tit enormously reduced in numbers. The few that
remained, however, laid very large clutches of eggs. Many laid
fourteen, hatching and rearing all, and some nested again immediately,
rearing a further five or six. The Marsh Tit, which did not suffer from
the hard winter, nested freely in the boxes, laying normal clutches of
seven or eight eggs. It is always a common bird here, but normally
only a small number occupy nesting-boxes. The Blue Tit has now
quite recovered its numbers, and seems to be extraordinarily prolific.
We had several broods of fifteen young this summer. The food supply
these last three years has been unlimited owing to the plague of the
green oak-moth (Tortrix viridana), and all wild birds and game-birds
have greatly benefited.
Most aviculturists have looked upon an abundant and suitable
supply of food as being sufficient to carry most hardy species through
a spell of severe weather. Nevertheless, the Common Bullfinch,
whose food supply cannot well have failed, was one of the greatest
sufferers in that year. They left the woods, came into the gardens,
and died in numbers. We picked up twelve one day on a bed of
Mediterranean heath, and they have not recovered their numbers
yet. Strange to say, the Goldfinch did not suffer at all. Yet the
Northern Bullfinch winters far within the Arctic Circle ! It cannot
have been entirely food supply, or why should the Long-tailed Tit and
Goldcrest have been nearly wiped out ? Their food was there all the
time. I think there is no doubt that the cold and freezing gales
were responsible. In this neighbourhood neither Woodpeckers,
Nuthatches, nor Tree-creepers suffered, and the first seem to
have greatly benefited by the present absence of the Starling as a
breeding species, while the Chaffinch and Goldfinch have replaced
the House-Sparrow.

By R. I. Pocock, F.R.S.
A notable and interesting addition to the Zoological Society's
collection of birds is a pair of collared Sunbirds {Anthothreptes
collaris), presented by Mr. Harold Millar, the Director of the Zoological
Gardens in Durban, who has added much to our knowledge of the
ornithology of South Africa. I do not know whether this species
has ever been imported alive to England before. Possibly some
member of the Avicultural Society may have been fortunate enough
to possess it. At all events it appears to be quite new to our Gardens,
and makes a welcome appearance in the list of species exhibited by the
Zoological Society.
It belongs to the family Nectariniidse, and has been known for over
a hundred years, its first scientific title being Cinnyris collaris. There-
after it passed through the genera Nectarinia and Anthodiceta, and has
found, let us hope, its final resting-place in Anthothreptes, a genus
which contains about a dozen species distributed over Africa and
Indo-Malaya, and is characterized by having the bill shorter than the
head, or at all events not longer, and only moderately curved, the tail
being square or slightly rounded owing to the approximate equality
in the length of the feathers.
The typical Collared Sunbird ranges, according to the late Di;. Stark,
from the Gamtoos River in Cape Colony, eastward through Eastern
Cape Colony to Natal and Zululand. Opinions differ as to the
frequency of its occurrence. Dr. Stark, for instance, described it as
a common species in Natal, whereas according to Mr. Ayres it is
decidedly scarce, though found throughout that province. Possibly
the discrepancy in these accounts is due to its abundance in certain
years and scarcity in others, owing to local causes, just as is the case
with some of our British birds.
Like all the Sunbirds it is a beautiful species, the adult male being
metallic golden-green on the head, back, and lesser wing-coverts ;
the greater coverts and secondaries are brown edged with metallic-
green ; the primaries brown edged with olive-yellow ; the tail-feathers

black edged with metal lie-green ; the throat metallic golden-green
bordered below by a pectoral band of violet, the rest of the under-
surface being yellow with bright yellow pectoral tufts. The adult
female resembles the male in the coloration of the upper side, but has
the entire under-surface yellow. So far, at all events as South Africa
is concerned, this Sunbird is exceptional in that both sexes exhibit
metallic plumage at all seasons of the year, and even the nestlings,
according to Shelley, show the metallic plumage of the adult female.
This appears to be one of those cases where a secondary sexual
character, originally appertaining to the male alone, is adopted by the
female, appears in the young at a comparatively early age, and ceasing
to be of sexual significance assumes specific importance. No doubt
readers of the Avicultural Magazine will recollect many similar cases
in birds. The antlers of the reindeer are an instance amongst mammals.
In habits the Collared Sunbird seems to resemble in a general way
other members of the family Nectarinikbe. They frequent low,
flowering bushes, and are seldom seen on the higher trees. During
the winter in Natal, Stark always observed them in larger or smaller
parties, busily engaged in hunting over the leaves and flowers in
search of small insects and nectar. In that province, at all events, the
bird is double-brooded, the first brood being hatched in January
and the second in March. The eggs, invariably two in number, as in
other Sunbirds, are greyish-white, thickly mottled and spotted with
brown and dark grey. The small dome-shaped nest, built of grass and
lined with horsehair and feathers, is suspended from the outer twigs
and leaves of a bush at no great height from the ground.
The two birds in the Gardens are a lively little couple, looking the
embodiment of health and vitality as they dart from place to place
in the cage, moving with equal facility and grace-along the under
and upper side of the branches. They are fed upon Mellin's Food,
condensed milk and honey mixed together, grapes, soft banana, the
palatability of which they are just beginning to discover, and one
mealworm a day each. Lovers of birds will feel well repaid bv a special
visit to inspect them.
I may add that the typical form of the Collared Sunbird described
above is replaced in East Africa by a local race, Anthothreptes collaris

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I hope to write some account of Monsieur Delacour's aviaries
after I have seen them. They are in course of erection at his new home
in Normandy--Chateau de Cleres, between Dieppe and Rouen.
There are not many enthusiastic aviculturists in France, but
Madame Lecallier, at Caudebec-les-Elbeuf, in Normandy, vies along
with Monsieur Delacour with any bird-lover in any country. None
of her aviaries are large, but they are very numerous, 1 and she adopts
the plan of a wired-in passage running along the front of the flights,
so that it is impossible for birds to escape, even if anyone entering any
particular aviary should leave the door unclosed, since they would
only find themselves in the wired passage, the entrance to which is
shut on going in. And in these aviaries, except for a larger central
one where there are innumerable Budgerigars of all known colours
(except white ones, which are still extremely rare), Madame Lecallier
keeps not more than two pairs of Parrakeets, in some flights only one,
and perhaps a pair of Pheasants (Tragopans, Monauls, Crossoptilon,
etc.), and consequently she is very successful in breeding them--
many colours, Bauer's, Rock Pebblers, etc., etc., as well as Conures
and Lorikeets.
I should like to see the collection in favourable weather, for I was
there on a bitterly cold day in the end of last November, yet even
then the Parrakeets of various species were looking robust and
apparently much less sensitive to the icy blasts than I was.
On her home farm Madame Lecallier keeps many White Peafowl
in addition to her poultry, amongst which I noticed a small flock
of Sebastopol Geese with their curious curly feathers.
1 Before long Madame Lecallier intends to have one hundred ! Since writing
the above, I visited her aviaries in August. She, like Monsieur Delacour, has an
English bird-keeper.

Madame Lecallier and Monsieur Delacour eagerly purchase
rarities, and several that have lately come to England have found
their way to Madame Lecallier's aviaries, amongst them some Amethyst
Starlings and a beautiful African Long-tailed Roller, which I hear is
extremely tame. Monsieur A. Decoux is another French aviculturist,
who goes in principally for various Waxbills and small Finches, and
who has been successful in breeding rare hybrids.
Our French confreres in aviculture will help to instil into us renewed
energy as well as creating a friendly rivalry. Monsieur Delacour&apos;s
pluck in recommencing a collection of birds and mammals after the
whole of his magnificent one was destroyed in the War at Yillers-
Bretonneux, is certainly an example to anyone not to give in on account
of losses and disappointments. He became a member of the
Avicultural Society when he was about 20 years old, and although
still quite young he knows as much as all aviculturists of a more
advanced age, and a good deal more than most of any age ! He has
had birds which many aviculturists have never even seen, and he aims
at obtaining those that one knows of as inhabiting the mountains
of Tibet, the forests of Java, the valleys of the Himalayas, the jungles
of South America, but which to the everyday aviculturist are as
fauna of the moon !

In answer to the Editor's request for notes, 1 wish that I could
send some avicultural news of interest, but fear that in its stead I can
only offer a few rambling remarks upon the free bird-life of our own
district in the past two seasons; and moreover, in doing this I am only
too sensible that I have nothing really new to add to that which has
been the experience of other observers.
I never remember to have seen so many Warblers. Our particular
corner of East Hampshire is not perhaps really well suited to these
birds, for we are on the shoulder of a hill which itself runs up the
centre of a valley, and is dominated by a great chalk escarpment,

thick with beech and yew, and we have relatively but little deciduous
coppice. The open spots on the juniper hills are occupied by Cirl
Buntings, Meadow and Tree Pipits, there are Wood Wrens about the
beeches, Sedge Warblers and Reed Warblers by the stream, but
Nightingales are almost absent, while Chiffchaffs and Willow Wrens
are sjjarscly sprinkled in only a few of the most likely places.
This year, however, Chiffchafis, Willow Wrens, Garden Warblers,
and Blackcaps seem to be " everywhere I think we have nearly
as many Tits, of four species (Long-tailed Tit not included), as
before the hard winter which reduced them to almost nothing.
In short, I am inclined to think that the only birds which have
not with us recovered from that disastrous season are the Song
Thrush, the Gold Crest, and in a lesser degree the Mistle Thrush,
and these last would have worked up their numbers pretty well
again but for the Magjues. Magpies have increased amazingly all
along the line of our hanging woods ; we have fifteen particular pairs
belonging, so to say, to this house, and the sight of a Magpie crossing
our valley with a callow nestling in its bill and pursued by a pair of
Mistle Thrushes was a constant event this spring. As one of the
Magpies' nests was but a few paces from my study window, there was
an opportunity of seeing the work of nest-building rarely afforded by
these secretive birds. They used to remind me of the Plantain-Eater,
seen in Africa, which if surprised upon the ground will fly to the
lowest branches of the nearest tree, and thence rapidly ascend by
hopping from branch to branch. The Magpies behaved in the same
way : after collecting " beaksful " of bents in the paddock they
would fly to the base of a big ivy-clad ash, rapidly " worm themselves",
so to speak, up to its summit, and then slip into the head of the
larch in which their nest was built.
Our Carrion Crows have also greatly increased in numbers ; if
you shut your eyes you may imagine yourself in Cairo or Benares,
their croaking is so persistent. I cannot find out that they do much
harm to birds ; they are most painstaking seekers in the meadow-
grass and, of course, pick up any wounded rabbits. I have never
noticed any suspicious behaviour on their part along the stream where
Ducks are nesting, and wish I could say the same of the Jackdaws.

This is the time of year when we get our daily and nightly visits from
Herons, who take serious toll of the big trout. Kingfishers also are
hard at work on the fry, and though they are a beautiful feature in
this garden f sometimes wish they were not always feeding ! 1 may say
the same of the foxes, for if it is one of our great delights to watch
three large cubs playing on a sunny bank behind the house, they
want a lot of feeding, and I greatly fear their vixen has been paying
attention to the pinioned Waterfowl. If I add that an old lien
Sparrowhawk for the second year in succession shot right through
the gatehouse into the courtyard and carried off young prize-bred
chickens all but as big as partridges, it will be admitted that we
have our share of wild-life troubles as well as of its delights
and joys.
But we mourn no loss so greatly as that of our Kestrels. We had
two pairs, and they nested just above the house. The tiercel of one pair
was, for a wild Falcon, a confiding bird ; he was my constant delight
as he stooped at the voles in the paddock, or rested on his favourite
perch, a bare ash bough not thirty yards from where I sit and write.
The story is rather a long one, but briefly it is this. In the autumn
and winter of 1918 and the spring of 1919 we suffered from a severe
visitation of field-voles and of wood-mice. They were in myriads, and
did great damage to the meadow-grass, garden-stuff, and shrubs.
They killed laurels and ate through the " collars " of the old yuccas
so that the great severed heads lay on the ground. In the woods
trees were whittled, and the fine, slender twigs of spindle-trees showed
white and glistening through the bark. The Kestrels and Barn Owls
had a great time then. Suddenly, in the beginning of April last year,
this plague was stayed. In a night, as it seemed, the host had
vanished. Not a vole or mouse was to be seen. The traps, in which
we had been taking numbers every day, now yielded not one. If
it was a relief for us it was not so for the birds ; our Kestrels
disappeared--I have not seen them since. We also, from the same
cause, lost our Barn Owls.
These Owls, who some years ago occupied one of the large Owl-
boxes, of which several are fixed up here in trees---one up in a large
ash, one in a big oak, another in a big silver-fir, a fourth in a deodar--

changed their quarters and took possession of a dovecote above the
stable roof. The dovecote has twelve compartments, with an alighting-
board in front of each. It was most entertaining to see the young
Owls playing hide-and-seek from one compartment to another. The
old birds used to be out well before dusk, quartering the grassland and
the garden. In the time of the vole plague it seemed they were
scarcely gone before they were back again with food. But early last
summer all was changed, for there were no field-mice. The Owls were
out in the morning, and hunted all day long, even when the sun was
hot. Day after day we saw them from our window, working hard and
almost hopelessly. They would frequently return to sit on the walling
of the terrace, but their wings drooped, and they seemed to be getting
thin and light. Whether they died or went away one could not tell,
but there was no Barn Owl&apos;s nest in the dovecote last summer, nor
have I seen a Barn Owl here since that time.
But now field-mice are in normal numbers, and we have Barn Owls
in the dovecote once more. A fortnight ago I noticed a casting in the
stable-yard, and these have increased in number, so it is certain that
owls are there ; moreover, I hear, as I lie in bed, the old familiar
screeching. But the ways of the newcomers are not those of the old
pair. They have never yet been seen in the dusk. Each evening I go
down into the garden, but never yet have seen or heard a Barn Owl
at that time; they do not venture out till dark. Also, they are more
untidy than our old pair, for these did not leave their castings in the
stable-yard.

As an example of the Derbian Screamer (Cliauna chavaria ) had
arrived at the Zoo, I made a special visit in August, 1920, chiefly with
the object of hearing its voice and of noticing if its scream agrees with
that of the allied species ( C . cristata), which is also represented in the
Gardens.

Aviary, it made occasionally a noise like the word " week " in a loud
tone, but only singly when heard by me, never repeated. This Derbian
Screamer seemed to me not to have yet completed its full size in body
growth, although the legs were large and well developed and red as in
C. cristata ; and I therefore arrived at the conclusion that the " week "
was the voice of the species when not fully adult. When uttered, it was
made while the bird was walking about, and had nothing to do with
alarm, thus agreeing with observations I made in former years on the
Crested Screamer. In this connexion two scenes noticed with the
C. cristata opposite to this C. chavaria seem worth mentioning, as both
again supported my previous remarks.
When one C. cristata was pecking at food supplied for the other
inmates of the aviary, a pair of Great American Egret ( Herodias
egretta) advanced in a threatening manner towards it, clearly wanting
some of the meat, and displaying with their beaks at the Screamer.
The latter, without making any noise, faced round on them with wings
raised and showing the spurs, a habit I have previously noticed.
Later on, both examples of C. cristata were resting on the grass,
feeding on it as is their habit, when an Ibis, walking up to them from
behind, pecked at the back of one. Here, again, there was no
sound uttered by either Screamer, although both at once rose with
wings opened, showing spurs, and remained so until the Ibis retreated,
after which they sat down and started feeding on grass as before. The
voice has nothing to do with alarm. On the ground, both species move
rather awkwardly with slow walk, and it was therefore surprising to me
to see the ease with which one C. cristata rose, about an hour later, and
flew down the Aviary ; but I was not fortunate enough to see the
C. chavaria fly, although it frequently raised its wings and looked
upwards as if it would do so. While agreeing in general shape
and colour with C. cristata, the broad, black collar covering most of
the neck makes C. chavaria more elegant, as does the contrast of red
round the eyes, the grey crown and crest, and the prevalence of white
on the lower part of the head. The iris is dark brown.
[The example of the Derbian Screamer (Chauna chavaria ) referred
to by Mr. Welch arrived at the Gardens recently with the consignment
of birds from New York. Judging from its colours, it appears to be

to make a duet. A pair of Crested Screamers, that formerly bred in
the Gardens, used always to scream in concert, and the striking of the
clock in the daytime invariably stimulated their vocal activities.

Mr. Hamlyn has been importing quite a number of South African
birds lately, and amongst those I have seen have been several rarities.
The well-known favourites such as Violet-eared and Dufresne's Wax-
bills have come in numbers. Thero have been some rare Barbets,
Tricholcema leucomelas, Lybius torquatus, and Trachyphomis cafer,
Grey Touracous, Red-capped Larks, and two or three species of Sunbird.
I secured for the Zoological Gardens three fine examples of Burchell's
Glossy Starling, a species not previously represented in the collection.
There are quite a number of good birds coming over just now, and
aviculturists should be on the look-out for treasures.

NOTES ON CRANES AT WOBURN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9763088" page_id="10099112"  page_num="167" year="" vol="">
By The Duchess of Bedford
One or two interesting events in the Crane world at Woburn are,
perhaps, worth putting on record. A female White-necked Crane
(Anthropoides leucauchen) paired with a Stanley Crane ( Anthr6p&gt;oides
paradisea), and two chicks were hatched. The young birds are now
nearly 3 months old, and are indistinguishable from young Stanley
Cranes. This statement I must qualify, however, by saying that
I have never seen a young Stanley Crane at this age ; but at all
events they bear a strong resemblance to the father and are not at all
like young White-necked Cranes which I know well.
In Hume &amp; Marshall's Game Birds of India, and also in Blaauw's
Monograph of the Cranes, it is stated that Sarus Cranes pair for life.
This statement may be true with regard to the bird in a wild state,
but I regret to say that in semi-domestication in Woburn Park, where
some are full-winged and those which are pinioned have the whole
park to range in, this reputation for conjugal fidelity has been shattered.
For many years previous to the War these Cranes nested and often
reared their young. One pair was in the habit of coming daily to be
fed at our windows. In another part of the park a second pair nested
annually, but in an effort to break the eighth commandment and

take some vegetables out of a kitchen garden, the female caught her
head in the fence and was found hanging and lifeless. The male shortly
after broke a wing which we amputated, and left him in an enclosure.
During the War the remaining pair ceased to breed. Domestic
differences were tolerated till this spring, when the female gave the
lie to Messrs. Hume and Blaauw, and flew off to the one-winged Crane
in the enclosure. The pair unfortunately nested close to a public
footpath, where they were constantly disturbed and the eggs did not
hatch.
Yet one other tragedy occurred. Two Manchurian Cranes were
hatched, and when about 2 months old one was seen to kill the other.
Altogether the War has not improved the morals of the Woburn
Crane world.

Since seeing Mr. Astley's wonderful Yellow-naped Woodpecker,
I was longing to keep a bird of this family as a cage bird. I thought
that there was very little hope of ever being able to do so when
M. Fontana, the well-known bird dealer of Bordeaux, wrote me some
time ago that he had just received a rare Woodpecker from Central
America, asking whether I would care to accept it as a present.
Nobody will doubt my answer, and a few days, afterwards I received
a lovely bird in very good condition. M. Fontana wrote that this
specimen had been shipped at Carthagena in Colombia with two other
birds of the same species. Unfortunately they were put into a wooden
cage, and during the voyage two of them got out of the cage, which was
naturally broken by them, flew away, and probably fell into the ocean.
As soon as he arrived at Cleres the Woodpecker was put into a
wired cage, in which several logs and pieces of rotten wood had been
placed for him. Various kinds of food were provided for the bird, but
he hardly touched the insectile mixture and meat, but ate greedily
some mealworms and ant cocoons. The food he is most fond of is

fruit and boiled potatoes, as well as sponge cake. That seems rather
an odd diet for a Woodpecker, and I suspect that my bird, obviously
hand-reared, though very timid, has learnt strange habits as regards
food owing to his late owner&apos;s method of feeding him.
I saw at once that my bird was a young male of some species of
Melanerpes. His total length is about 7 inches ; back, wings, and
tail black barred with white, the quill being black ; rump white ;
underparts pale drab, except the abdomen which is orange, and a few
dark mottles on the thighs ; crown crimson, occiput and nape washed
with red ; the rest of the head is drab, with a slight touch of yellow
near the bill which is dark grey, as well as the feet; eyes dark brown.
The call reminds one of the voice of the Magpie in a small way.
I was rather puzzled to determine the exact species of my bird. The
plates in the Old Malherbe's Monographic des Picidies show me that
he resembles very much Zebrapicus ( Melanerpes) rubriventris ; but my
Woodpecker could not belong to that species, which lives in Yucatan,
since he came from Colombia. At last I came to the conclusion that
he was Melanerpes wagleri. In captivity my Woodpecker behaves
like all his cogeners, and is most attractive in his ways. Though they
need special management owing to their habit of destroying wood,
Woodpeckers are most desirable cage birds, and I wish more of them
could be imported into Europe.

Everyone sympathized with Monsieur Delacour when they knew
that the whole of his splendid collection of birds was destroyed at
Villers Bretonneux, near Amiens, during the War; and all aviculturists
will equally rejoice with him that he has been able not only to acquire
a very beautiful new home at Cleres, half-way between Dieppe and
Rouen, but that he has already formed the nucleus of what promises
to be a fine gathering of rare birds, and also mammals.

I had the pleasure of staying with him in August. The chateau
itself, which is sixteenth century, with a fifteenth century annexe,
is situated in a wooded valley, and a small clear chalk river running
close to the house broadens to a miniature lake with two islands,
where later on many waterfowl will be assembled.
The ground rises steeply on one side of the water, with splendid
trees and grassy glade, whilst on the other the flat meadow-land is
again bounded by trees and the wooded line of the hills, all of which
exceptional beauty can be viewed from the windows of the chateau.
In the chateau itself a gallery of 45 feet long opens on to an ancient
terrace, and in this gallery Monsieur Delacour has cages and small
aviaries which occupy the whole length on one side, whilst on the other
are two large aquariums.
The occupants of the bird gallery are Sunbirds (Mariquensis and
Malachite), Blue, Green, and Yellow-winged Sugar birds, Gold-fronted
Phyllornis, various Tanagers, such as Necklace, Superb, and one
specimen of Calliste pretiosa, a very handsome bird with chestnut
head, fawn shoulders, and pale blue-green underparts. In another
compartment are two Barbets, the Levaillant and the black-collared
Lybius torquatus, a rare bird, with brilliant scarlet on the fore neck,
edged with a broad black band. Budgerigars are represented by
green, blue, yellow, apple-green, and olive. Several species of Waxbills
and small seed-eaters, Cuban Finches, etc., inhabit another cage-
aviary.
Many aviculturists would be quite content to own only the
inhabitants of the Gallerie des Oiseaux, as it is now called, where once
the gallants of the time of Henri IV of France paraded, when it was
known as the Gallerie des Seigneurs. Opening the door at the farther
end, one finds oneself on the terrace, raised high above the drive below,
which leads one to the beautiful fifteenth century portion of the chateau
or rather annexe, a charmingly picturesque building in stone, ancient
red brick, and red-painted half-timbers of true Norman style of that
period. Steeply pitched roofs of mellowed tiles, and two turrets, from
the narrow windows of which one expects to see some lady of the
time of Henri IV looking down upon one, add to the charm, and if
a troubadour in doublet and hosen came strolling by playing his viol,

one would not be altogether astonished. Instead of that the songs
and cries of bird's voices greet one's ears, for Monsieur Delacour has
dedicated the ground-floor rooms to them.
As one enters there are four large and lofty aviary compartments,
in which there are such birds as Grey Touracos, various Pies (Blue
from South America, Himalayan Wandering Tree-pie, chestnut and
black Magpies), a Green-billed Toucan, Glossy Starlings, a pair of
rare Pied Shrikes ( Urolestes melanoleucus) from South Africa, almost
the size of the Greater Shrike of Europe, but with long tails ; Grey-
winged Ouzels, and various Mynahs and Troupials. Opening out of
this room is the bird-room proper, where later on Monsieur Delacour
hopes to keep Humming-birds, for all is heated from a furnace with
hot-water pipes. Here on the wall side are a series of large fixed cages
in two tiers, the top one with flat wooden roofs, the lower ones on which
they rest having bowed roofs of wire, and these jut beyond the level of
the upper storey.
On the window-side a long and broad shelf runs where separate
cages are placed. Here are several rarities. A Lesser Paradise bird
and a Javanese Golden Oriole ( Oriolus maculatus) ; a pair of Cuban
Trogons, a rare African Mouse-bird ( Colius erythromelon), a pair of
Amethyst Starlings, a Glossy Calornis Starling, four species of Bulbuls
(Pycnonotus , including P. pygceus, White-cheeked, and Cape). A splendid
Giant Barbet ( Megalcema virens), a bold and beautiful bird ; a Hoary
Jungle Barbet (M. caniceps). A very rare small Woodpecker, not much
larger than the Lesser Spotted of Europe ( Melanerpes wagleri), from
Colombia (Carthagena). A bird with Zebra-like black ami white
body, and a patch of red on the crown. A deliciously tame and lovely
African Roller ( Coracias caudatus), with forked, swallow-like tail,
the whole throat and upper breast of a delicate lilac, the underparts
Eton blue, the wings and tail bright blue and eau de nil. This bird
spreads his wings, calling loudly as a welcome when one enters. As
Monsieur Delacour said, Rollers must have plenty of wing exercise,
since in a wild state they catch their prey after the manner of swallows,
hawking at flying insects.
On the higher ground, concealed from the chateau by trees, are the
magnificent aviaries still unfinished. The whole measure about 98 feet

by 65 feet. One very large one for Waxbills, etc., in which will be
flowering shrubs, is 20 metres by 8 metres. Three large divisions in
the front. Another of 6 metres by 3 metres and eight smaller ones--
3 metres by 2 metres and 3 metres by 4 metres. Of course a metre is
3 ft. 6 in.
Monsieur Delacour has commenced his collection of Water-fowl.
A pair of Tufted Duck which he bought in May at once nested and
reared a large brood, which in August were able to fly, and charming
they looked circling round and disappearing beyond the woods, to
return again swishing down on to their sheltered waters in the park.
Some Chiloe Widgeon and Pochard were there too, besides Geese
(Cereopsis, Ross' Snow Geese, Canadian, Bar-headed, and Magellanic).
Monsieur Delacour had the misfortune to lose a pair of the very rare
Ashy-headed Geese, and also one of his two Trumpeter Swans. One
Ashy-headed Goose died of gapes, a very uncommon event in a Goose
at liberty in a park, and its mate apparently succumbed from grief
a few days after, as the post mortem examination showed no disease
of any kind. Six Spicifer Peafowl and three white ones, as well as
two eared Pheasants (Ho-ki), wander here and there, and then there
are the Cranes, four Indian Sams, a pair of White-necked, a European,
and a Stanley. Three fine white Rheas are very conspicuous, and
occasionally one catches a glimpse of a Monaul, of which species there
are three or four, pinioned and at large. I also came across a Siamese
Fireback Pheasant. Pheasantries are being constructed on the steep
slope above the little lake, and most picturesque roosting houses in
plaster and half timbers with steep thatched roofs; so that the
Pheasants' settlement resembles a human village in miniature, with its
charming little cottages, where gradually a collection of Tragopans
and other rarer species will be gathered together.
Monsieur Delacour hopes to turn out certain Parrakeets and Peach-
faced Love-birds at liberty, putting up nesting-boxes for them all
about the park.
Mammals do not come within the province of aviculture, but
I might mention that there is a small herd of Indian Black Buck
Antelopes, three small Chinese Deer, some Patagonian Cavies, and
three of those extraordinary rodents, the Capybara, which is the size

Why she was called Jaco I do not know, for she was not a Grey
Parrot but a St. Lucia Amazon (Chrysotis versicolor). Many members
of the numerous family of Amazon Parrots are well-known in aviculture,
but the three great island species, C. versicolor, C. guildingi, and C.
bouqueti, have always been rare. They are magnificent in plumage,
but have not a good reputation as pets. It is said, however, that the
very few which have been captured alive have been secured when
adult by shooting. This would not tend to produce confidence and
docility, and I believe myself that young males taken from the nest
would talk as freely and show as much affection for their owners as
the familiar Blue-fronted Amazon.
I first made Jaco's acquaintance several years ago when she was
in the possession of my late friend Lord Sherborne, better known to
Parrot-lovers as Canon Dutton. She was then a splendid bird, her
fine condition being due, no doubt, to the fact that in summer she was
let out daily in the garden to enjoy complete liberty. She loved her
master and was good friends with the gardener, who fed and looked
after her, but she plainly showed that she had no use for me. Failing
health, unhappily, obliged my friend to give up his parish and exchange
the beautiful Vicarage at Bibury for a smaller house in Cheltenham.
The change was a sad one for Jaco, also. There were no more summer
outings for her, and in time she began to show the effect. Her beak
grew long and required periodical cutting, a sure sign that she was
growing old.
Last winter my friend was taken to the fuller life of service for which
he was so well fitted, and Jaco came to me. He had always told me

that he wanted me to have Jaco, should she survive him, in order that
she might again enjoy her freedom. However, on seeing the old
Parrot some weeks after her arrival in the Isle of Wight, I was dis-
appointed to find her breathing badly and looking none too well. It
seemed as though she was more likely to join her master in a better
land than live to enjoy her freedom in this one.
When summer came I had Jaco sent over to me and turned her into
a small outdoor aviary. Her breathing was rather better and her
appetite fair, but she was very shaky on her legs and her feet seemed to
be losing their power of grasping. For some days she remained about
the same, then she grew worse and could hardly keep on her perch at
all unless she held on to the wire netting with her beak. The case
seemed hopeless ; a friend of mine once had a Guilding's Amazon
which completely lost the use of its legs for some time before its death,
and I had no doubt that Jaco was going the same way. I concluded
that it would be kindest to have her painlessly destroyed, and began to
make the necessary arrangements. Next day, however, Jaco seemed
a little better, and from that time on she very slowly improved.
Having ascertained as far as possible that she was not tuberculous--
a most necessary precaution, by the way, as I once learned to my cost
in the case of an old Roseate Cockatoo, who gave the disease to my
Banksians--I decided to give Jaco a chance at liberty. I never for
a moment expected success ; she was too weak to climb and it seemed
highly improbable that she could fly, but it was the only hope and I
opened the top of the aviary. Jaco walked slowly out and surveyed
the trees around her with growing interest. She began to call and get
restless, raised her wings, and finally launched herself into the air.
She got on remarkably well, and her first flight landed her half way up
a tall elm. Subsequent flights took her to the top of the highest trees
in the garden, and there she remained. For three days she flew to
and fro without showing exhaustion from hunger ; then she descended
on to the gardener's shoulder and was carried to the feeding-tray,
which she afterwards visited of her own accord. Then the rain came,
48 hours of it and very cold. Jaco began to look rather miserable,
and I carried her into an aviary shelter. However, she walked out at
once and flew away. Another 24 hours' rain followed, and I expected

to have to take her into hospital with a chill, but she was looking better
than the day before ; and marvellous to relate she has never ceased to
improve, and all the frosts and deluges of this inclement summer have
failed to harm her !
r&apos; But not only does Jaco possess a remarkable constitution, she is
endued, apparently, in spite of her age and infirmity, with great
feminine charm. She had not been out long before she had captivated
the heart of an old king Parrakeet whose story has been told elsewhere.
A few days later she made an equally deep impression on a crippled
African Ring-neck -- a miserable little bird who could neither walk nor
fly properly and was bullied by all the other Parrakeets. For a time
the king allowed him but little opportunity of pressing his suit, but
the power of great passion to overcome obstacles is not only apparent
in human circles. In spite of his lame leg and damaged wing, in spite
of the fact that he was moulting, the ring-neck defeated the king in
pitched battle, and not only him but all the other Palceornis Parrakeets
as well, including a robust and spiteful female of his own species.
After that he had Jaco to himself as long as she remained on the top
of the aviary, but whenever she flew off the king rejoined her and the
ring-neck was left calling disconsolately. His delight on her return
was quite touching and he would sidle up to her and start his comical
squirming display, and whenever she drank he always made a point of
sipping the drops that ran off the end of her bill ! Jaco treated her
two admirers with the reserve suitable to her age and sex. She repelled
their advances when they became too familiar and made some of her
own, but she occasionally conversed with them and they alone were
allowed to feed in the tray beside her, other Parrakeets being driven
away. Of the two she preferred the ring-neck, thereby showing her
good taste, for he was undoubtedly the better gentleman of the two,
the king being inclined to be selfish and greedy.
Til her old home, 1 was told, Jaco used her wings remarkably little,
spending all her time in the same tree. Now, however, either because
she has company, or because she considers it good for her health, she
flies quite a lot, particularly in the early morning and late evening.
Soon after sunrise each day her raucous voice heralds her approach,
and she passes my window slightly preceded by the king, whose graceful

swinging flight is more rapid than hers. She looks very imposing, the
dark blue and scarlet of her wings showing to great advantage, but she
is no song-bird; her cries with few exceptions are loud, dismal, and
discordant, and at times she is very loquacious !
Although her late master considered her sensitive to cold, I intend to
try and winter her at liberty. So far she has proved decidedly hardy
and she has a tremendous lot of down under her thick plumage. For the
present, anyhow, she is renewing her youth like the proverbial Eagle.

<bodyText confidence="0.991077125" page_id="10099123"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O.
Last April when at Sukuta in the Gambia, I caught two of these
birds (presumably a pair) in a trap-cage set for Waxbills. I put them
in a cage together, and crammed them with a few grasshoppers ; next
day they were eating white ants readily and would take grasshoppers
alive or dead, so I decided to try and keep them. Then came
the question of what was to be the staple food when live food would
no longer be obtainable. The choice was limited and practically
confined to biscuit and milk. This, fortunately, they soon took to,
eating it greedily in a few days, especially when the milk had gone sour,
as it so quickly does in the tropics. The birds travelled with me on my
usual round till the end of June, when I came to headquarters to catch
the steamer home. Here the trouble began ; insect food, even cock-
roaches, was difficult to get, and no cow's milk at all was obtainable
only " Ideal ", which never sours properly. They took this because
there was nothing else, but most certainly noticed the difference, and
very soon it became obvious that all was not well " with their little
insides ". They, however, both lived to get on ship-board, but one (I
think the hen) died the first day out. The other, however, lived, in spite
of the fact that it was an almost cockroachless ship, and in due course
reached home. Then, thanks to helpful parcel-clerks at Lime Street and
Euston, to an early Sunday morning visit to the Zoo, and a curatorial
motor-bike and side-car, I had the pleasure of seeing this rare bird
(probably a first importation) in a cage de luxe in its new home in Surrey,

and eating English grasshoppers, all within sixteen hours of leaving the
boat at Liverpool. I have since heard that it bathed within an hour
or two of arrival, took readily to the soft food supplied, and settled
down well. I hope that it will long survive and that we may hear from
its owner more about its characteristics in captivity, and especially
(if it is a male) as to whether it has a song or not.
I myself never heard any song from these birds. The only sounds
I know them to make, either in a wild state or in confinement, are a
rather harsh, single whistle and a pretty constant scolding chatter,
which gets louder and more strident under the influence of fright or
excitement, and is certainly not at all musical. Other members of the
genus, however, are known to be good songsters, so perhaps ours may
be also.
Knowing this to be the case, I used to attribute a song consisting
of a series of sweet liquid notes to these Chat-Thrushes, but later on
I found I was mistaken, and that the real utterer of this song was the
Senegal Bush-Shrike, Tschagra senegala, which is about the most
noteworthy of Gambian songsters.
This genus ( Cossypha ) is found throughout Africa. In the Gambia
we have two species, C. albicapilla and verticalis, which have much
the same coloration but differ in size, 10 as against 71 inches in length,
the former, the species I brought home, being the larger.
Both species distinctly suggest large Redstarts in plumage, the
general colour-scheme being black upper and bright rufous under parts,
with clear silver-grey crowns. C. verticalis differs from albicapilla
not only in size but in having a rufous hind-collar, which is absent in
the larger species, or in some examples just marked by a few rufous
feathers. Both are found in the same sort of haunts, bush near water,
particularly the patches of thick palm and other bush along the creeks
and round the cattle-wells on the landward borders of the swamps.
They are nearly always in pairs, one jiair in each suitable site, from which
they seem jealously to exclude any near relation.
These bush-encircled wells are definite bird-centres. They are
usually rather gloomy dark places, owing to the dense shade of the
surrounding trees, and this gloom is distinctly and frequently lighted
up by the quick movements and striking plumage of their most constant

frequenters, the larger of our two Chat-Thrushes. The smaller ( C .
verticalis ) is, I should have said, a distinctly rarer bird in the Gambia,
and is more a haunter of the creek or riverside bush than of these wells,
where besides a pair of Cossypha one is almost certain to find all day and
every day a pair of the gorgeous scarlet-breasted Barbary Shrikes and
a pair of Honey-Guides. These constitute the residents, but numerous
other birds also visit the wells for water, usually very early in the
morning, at midday, and late in the evening, that is when they are not
in use for their proper purpose, cattle-watering, and when the birds
and their attendant small boys are away.
Doves and Bush-fowl are from their size the most noticeable of the
early and late visitors, but one can also be certain of seeing parties of
Dusky Bulbuls, Broad-tailed and Black-crowned Babblers, a Drongo
or two, and various Waxbills and Glossy Starlings, though these seem
to come for water in large numbers during the midday hours, when
Doves and Bush-fowl never seem to want a drink.
Our two Gambian species of Cossypha in general behaviour and
looks eeem to me to be nearer the Babblers than the true Thrushes.
The general shape, especially the leggy look, their movements, and
notes are most Babbler-like, and in captivity their ways and food
requirements agree exactly with those of the two Babblers (Crateropus),
which I have kept at different times
I regret that I know nothing about the nesting or the eggs of these
birds, nor can I find any record of these or of the other West African
species, but will quote from two sources most interesting accounts
about some more southern representatives. This will provide a more
complete account of the charming birds of the genus Cossypha.
In Stark k Sclater's Birds of South Africa (vol. ii, 1901, p. 209)
five species of Cossypha are described, under the English name " Robin-
Chats these are :--
C. bicolor (Sparrm.) and C. natalensis, Smith, both confined to South
Africa, where they are popularly known as " Piet-myn-vrouw
C. heuglini, Hartlaub, ranging from North-East South Africa to
the Upper Nile.
C. cajfra (Linn.), the " Jan Fredrik " of South Africa.
C. humeralis (Smith), Northern and Eastern South Africa.

<bodyText confidence="0.993293390243902" page_id="10099126"  page_num="179" year="" vol="">
All accounts show them to be good singers, and also, at any rate as
regards some species, mockers as well. C. bicolor, Dr. Stark says, has
" a loud and powerful voice, and besides some sweet notes of its
own imitates the cries of various other birds, such as the Emerald
Cuckoo, Red-winged Shrike, Goatsucker, Buzzard, Sea-Eagle, and
even the call of the Tree-frog ".
As regards C. natalensis, he quotes (p. 211) Mr. A. D. Millar, as
follows: --
" This Chat-Robin . . . like other members of its genus, is
a perfect mocking bird in the neighbourhood of his haunt. Many a
collector has rushed frantically on hearing what he believed to be the
Emerald Cuckoo, only to find, on approaching the spot, that it was
one of these Chat-Robins.
" They nest in the hollow of a stump or tree . . . laying three
eggs varying in shades of colour from olive-green to rich dark
brown."
The same writer in his account of the next species, C. heuglini,
quotes Capt. Boyd Alexander, who writes
" In the Zambesi region this species commences to breed towards
the end of December ; the male bird is then in full song, but at other
times of the year the song is reduced to a short string of babbling
notes. The song is rich and mellow, the long-drawn-out notes
increasing in volume, suddenly to break off into a string of bubbling
sounds that turn the next moment to soft volubility, the voice
being raised in pitch till it becomes a faint whisper, just as if the
singer were soliloquizing.
" This Cossypha frequents thick undergrowth, waste lands,
where there are bush-grown dells holding water or reed beds
bordering the river. It is a shy bird, and keeps much to the bottom
of the tangled brushwood, decoying the listener on with occasional
snatches of song, but never allowing him to come to close quarters.
The female has no song."
A more recent observer, Mr. C. F. M. Swynnerton, more than con-
firms all the delightful qualities of this species, writing in an account
of the Birds of Gazaland (Ibis, 1908, p. 84), as follows : --
" It is by far our finest local songster, and to my mind not one
of our boasted English song-birds, hardly the Nightingale, is to be
classed with it for a moment. It begins to sing just after the first
streak of dawn appears, and continues to do so for little more than
half an hour, ceasing before sunrise in order to commence the day's
business. During the remainder of the day it remains comparatively

silent, uttering only occasionally, perhaps, a few times in succession,
one of its commoner flute-like notes ... I had the great good fortune
to pitch my camp on the Kurumadzi, just beside the haunt of one
of these charming songsters, and I would lie awake every morning
before sunrise listening to its song. It possessed a wonderful variety
of notes. . . . Perhaps the most striking feature of the song is that
these notes are frequently accompanied by a high, long-drawn
' Wheee-wheee-wheee ', or sometimes ' plee ! heplee ! heplee ! '
particularly at the end of the song, which usually begins low and
gradually increases in volume. I at first took this to be in the nature
of a duet, scarcely believing it possible that one bird could produce
both sets of notes at the same time, but I have now had several
opportunities of observing the bird while singing, and have little
doubt that it does so."
Mr. Swynnerton goes on to describe a nest he found in the head of
a thick branching stump about 3 feet from the ground, overhanging
the mud at the edge of a pool. It contained two eggs, of which he gives
a coloured figure opposite p. 443 of the same volume. They are a light
brown in colour.
About the habits of the last two South African species of Cossypha
little is mentioned in the Birds of Soxit.h Africa, but about the " Jan
Fredrik " ( C. caffra) we are there told (p. 213) that it is common about
Cape Town and throughout nearly the whole of South Africa, where it
is popularly known as the " Cape Robin ". It resembles an English
Robin more or less in habits, and is described by Dr. Stark as
" a sociable bird . . . found generally in gardens and about the
houses, where it hops and glides about in the bushes, drooping its
wings and jerking its tail when it alights. . . It has a sweet song,
heard usually in the morning, in addition to the cry . . . 1 Jan
Fredric'. . . The Woodwards state that in Natal it is by no means
so familiar a bird as about Cape Town, and that it is there shy and
retiring, and only found in the thick woods.
" This bird builds early, often in August, in Cape Town and the
neighbourhood ; the nest, which resembles very closely that of
an English Robin, is placed on a tree stump or in a bush two or three
feet from the ground. . . the eggs . . . are somewhat like those of the
European Robin, being a very j3ale blue, profusely mottled with
pale rufous, so. that the egg appears to be a pale brown."
From these accounts it will be seen that song is one of the chief
attractions of these South African species of Cossypha?, and one would
almost expect that ours must have something more musical than the

sounds I know. I can find nothing about C. albicapilla, but the two
following notes from the Ibis about C. verticalis are apposite, and
will form a suitable conclusion.
Of this species Major H. J. Kendall, writing on the birds of Sierra
Leone, says (Ibis, 1914, p. 207):--
" This handsome bird is more often heard than seen. It has a
fine song which it utters at sundown from the midst of the
densest thickets, and it is only during its short flights from one
thicket to another that one catches sight of it."
In the 1902 volume C&apos;apt. Boyd Alexander speaks of its mellow
trills; and of melanonota, a sub-species of C. verticalis, Mr. V. G. K.
van Someren, in an account of the Birds of Uganda, etc. (Ibis, 1916,
p. 472), says that " it is quite a good singer and mimic ".

Sirs,-- In my record of birds which have bred in captivity
there are a good many corrections to make. One of these refers to the
two Siskins, Spinus tibetanus (Hume), the Sikhim Siskin, and
II ypacanthis spinoides (Vigors), the Himalayan Siskin. These two
birds are both often known as " Himalayan Siskins ", hence the
confusion in the entries dealing with them.
Of H. spinoides, I gave the first breeder as " Teshemaker, 1914.
See Bird Notes, 1914, 278 ". I believe now that this entry should
be transferred to S. tibetanus, and be replaced by " 1st. Shore Baily,
1918. See A.M. 1919, 92 ". Is this so ?
As regards hybrids the entries are : Himalayan Siskin X Green-
finch, Bright, 1916. See Bird Notes, 1916, 83. Greenfinch X
Himalayan Siskin, Bright. See Bird Notes, 1917, 195. Himalayan
Siskin/Greenfinch hybrid X Greenfinch, Bright. See Bird Notes,
1917, 195. Which Siskin is this, tibetanus or spinoides ?
The other hybrid entry is: Greenfinch X Sikhim Siskin (H.
spinoides), Shore Baily. See A.M., 1919, 92. This I presume is
certainly spinoides.
Can the breeders or others answer these questions or help towards
the correction of the record ?

The Editorship of the Magazine
THE VOICE OF THE KAGU
Sirs, --I do not know how many different notes this New
Caledonian bird can utter, but when in London during August,
1920, the adult in the Western Aviary of the Zoological Gardens
uttered on several occasions a very low chuckle, during which the
throat was conspicuously dilated. It is only the sound which I have
heard the bird utter since first seen in November, 1906, and was
only uttered when I was talking to the bird and getting it to erect
its long crest, never when walking alone and unobserved by human
beings ; and could only be heard when quite close to it.
These latter facts seemed to me to suggest that the chuckle is
usually made either in the breeding season, or when two or more of
these grey birds are performing the curious antics they are said to do
when wild. But perhaps one or other of the co-Editors has heard it
at other times besides as above stated, or heard some other noise made
by the species much louder than the above ? Would it not be of
interest to have a note later on in the Magazine stating how long this
bird finally lived in the Gardens, because such might give an idea
as to the length of life when wild ? A gentleman from Ceylon, with
whom I was in conversation at one time when this bird uttered its
chuckle, asked me : " How long do these birds live when wild, on an
average ? " I replied, " You've stumped me there--I can't say ! "
Frederick D. Welch, M.R.C.S.
[The Kagu occasionally utters a very loud call.-- Eds.]
THE EDITORSHIP OF THE MAGAZINE
May I venture to express not only my own warm appreciation,
but also, I feel sure, that of all the members of the Society, at the
way in which Mr. Pocock and Mr. Seth-Smith have so kindly
stepped into the breach by undertaking a joint editorship until
someone else can be found to undertake the work, and the apprecia-
tion is enhanced by the fact that both are very busy men with little
time to spare outside their work at the Zoological Gardens and for
the London Zoological Society. The Magazine already promises to
resume its pre-War aspect, and will once again prove a success if
members will do their best to supply avicultural articles and notes.

Some time ago, seeing some Yellow-shouldered Tanagers advertised
at a very reasonable price, I wrote for them, but found that they had
already found a home, whether on this earth or the next I know not,
but the dealer wrote saying that he had forwarded me some Violet
Tanagers instead. I was not a little disgusted, for I did not want such
common birds as Euphonia violaceci.
In due course a tiny cage arrived, and the contents were examined,
but they were certainly not Violet Tanagers. It was only after searching
through quite a number of ornithological works that I came to the con-
clusion that the birds were Pectoral Tanagers (Euphonia pectoralis).
These little birds inhabit the south-east parts of Brazil. The male may
be described as of the same glossy dark purple as its near relative, the
Violet Tanager. There is a patch of yellow down each side of the breast,
the abdomen is dark chestnut, the bill black and shiny, the legs dark
leaden-grey. The eyes are full, black, beadlike, and prominent.
The hen has the head, nape, throat, and upper part of the breast slate
grey, a broad stripe of the same colour runs from the upper part of
the breast to the vent, and in some lights the head has a beautiful
bluish sheen. The sides are bright olive yellow, the upper parts dark

olive green, the flight feathers are edged with yellow, and the under
tail-coverts are rich chestnut, similar to those of a Waxwing.
In size and habits these birds resemble their cousins, the Violet
Tanagers ; the song (at least, I think it is the song) is exactly like the
alarm-note of the Cordon Bleu, only prolonged for a greater time, and
uttered with the wings and tail half spread out and the whole body
swaying from side to side.
These little birds have that quick, perky, and confiding temperament
that renders them so dear to their owner ; indeed, they very much
remind me of Wrens (always on the move, jolly, inquisitive, clean, and
tight in plumage). It would be a great shame to keep such birds in
a cage.
As to food, well, I have never seen birds eat such a quantity; they
must eat quite three or four times their own weight per day, the menu
consisting of a ripe banana and a ripe pear per day, only the skins
remaining in the morning. The fruit bill must cost something like
#9 per year (reckoning 2 d. for a banana and 4&lt;7. for a pear), which is
several times their cost. Such fruit as peaches, grapes, plums, etc.,
luckily for one's pocket, do not seem to be relished, but any small
insect is greedily devoured. The other day I threw into the&apos; aviary
a large spider, which the birds quickly darted upon, but in their hurry
they missed it, and when it reached the floor it curled up and lay as
though dead ; the birds dropped to the ground and hunted all round the
spot where it had fallen, but were quite unable to see it, and after
hunting round for some minutes gave it up as a bad job, yet they had
walked over the spider several times. Very little soft food is eaten,
and only once have I seen them eat seed, but that I think was more
out of curiosity than anything else. They will usually pick over green
food, but whether any is eaten I do not know; no doubt they look it
over for any small insects that might be there. The food seems to pass
through these birds very quickly.
The Pectoral Tanager is perhaps more frequently imported than
supposed, being confused with the Violet Tanager by the dealers.
Jollier little birds than these I have seldom had, and I can recom-
mend this species to anyone who wants rare, yet tame, interesting,
and easily kept birds.

By E. W. Harper, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U., in charge of the collection.
After waiting for two months for a suitable steamer, thes.s. Gamaria
was generously placed at our disposal by the British India Steam
Navigation Company, and on May 29, 1920, the collection embarked
at Calcutta, arriving in the London docks on July 16, a voyage of
forty-nine days. Except for a few days of rough weather in the Indian
Ocean, when the decks were awash, the voyage was a pleasant one.
The master, Capt. Evans, did all he possibly could for the welfare of
the collection.
The collection was made of mammals (including a large elephant
and a pair of tigers), birds, reptiles, batrachians, and fishes ; but my
remarks must be restricted to the birds, of which the following is a list
of the species which arrived : --

Many of the cages for the smaller birds were made entirely of
split bamboo, about 31 feet, long, divided into compartments of about
a cubic foot each, every compartment having a deep water-tin that
could not be upset, and a metal food-dish turning on a pivot, which
could be replenished without putting the hand inside the cage. Being

floor of the cage. In both cases the bird's droppings fell through the
bars or wire-netting, thus keeping the birds clean. On board ship space
has to be economized to such an extent that, even when the cages are
cleaned once daily, but for this barred floor arrangement the birds
would soon become very dirty.
Keeping insectivorous birds for forty-nine days without such foods
as dried flies, ants, cocoons, powdered pupae, gentles, and mealworms
may seem to be no easy matter, but very finely minced lean mutton
and hard-boiled egg, added to cooked pea-meal and " ghee " (refined
butter), answered the purpose very well. I found that, by mashing the
hard-boiled egg on a plate with the back of a fork, the particles of egg
were of a convenient size. Jay-thrushes, Crow-pheasants, Blue Magpies,
and Tree Pies received small pieces of raw meat, in addition to the pea-
meal. As I have a high opinion of fruit as an article of diet for birds,
this was always provided when procurable, very few birds in the
collection being non-frugivorous. When fresh fruit was unobtainable,
dates, previously moistened with warm water, were relished by the
birds. The Chukor Partridges always looked for their daily allowance
of a small piece of raw meat. The Vultures and Kites were fed upon
the entrails of the bullocks and sheep slaughtered for the tigers and other
Carnivora on board. The only seed-eating bird--not counting game-
birds--in the collection was a Black-crested Bunting. The s.s. Gamana ,
being a new ship, on her maiden voyage, no such luxuries for the birds
as cockroaches were to be obtained. Any birds that died on board
were given to the predatory birds or to the small Carnivora.
Unfortunately a civet-cat escaped during the voyage, through its
cage being thrown down in rough weather and broken. It was three or
four days before the animal was recaptured, but in that time it destroyed
some of the rarest birds in the collection, viz. Bengal Pitta, Green-
breasted Pitta, Niltava Flycatcher, and Yellow-eyed Babbler. The
Green-breasted Pitta would probably have been new to the London Zoo,
so its loss was particularly annoying. One of the Jungle Babblers
opened its cage-door on two or three occasions and escaped, but this
species is so decidedly gregarious that it was an easy matter to
recapture it.
Some of the Sarus Cranes were particularly spiteful, on one occasion

causing a nasty wound on the back of the hand of one of the keepers.
Only by holding an inverted frying-pan with a long handle (made for
watering the tigers) over the hand of the keeper when he was taking out
or replacing the seed- and water-tins could the savage attacks of the
Crane's spear-like bills be warded off. The Peafowl, Cranes, Partridges,
and Quails had an almost daily ration of chopped onions, in addition to
their staple diet of grain. The Egrets were fed twice daily upon meat
or fish in small pieces ; owing to the Egret&apos;s bullying nature--they were
all in one cage--the weaker ones had to be separated.
Perhaps the rarest bird in the collection was a single example of
the Spotted-wing ( Psaroglossa spiloptera), which has the distinction of
possessing a genus all to itself! It was about eighteen years ago that
I had the honour of presenting the London Zoo with their first Spotted-
wing. Some authors, including Jerdon, spell the generic name without
the letter p. Jerdon, who calls the bird the " Spotted-winged
Stare", places it between the Starlings and the Crackles, or Hill-
Mynahs ; but Oates, in his Fauna of British India (Birds), says it
#i has been universally considered a Starling, but in my opinion
erroneously so He places it near the Silver-eared Mesia, between
the Fruitsuckers ( Chloropsis) and the Bulbuls. Dr. A. G. Butler, in his
Foreign Birds for Cage and A viary (part i), considers the Spotted-wing
as more nearly related to the Bulbuls than the Starlings. In the same
book he quotes me as saying, firstly, that I " considered its affinity
to the Starlings very doubtful ", and, secondly, " that it was a hopping
bird, and did not use its mandibles as dividers after the manner of
Starlings." In spite of the Starling-like call of the Spotted-wing,
my opinion, expressed in 1902, remains unaltered. Further, Dr. Butler
states that Mr. Pycraft, after dissecting a body of the Spotted-wing,
&quot; decided in favour of its relationship to the Bulbuls."
One of the most valuable birds in the collection, a Temminck s
Tragopan, succumbed to the terrific heat in the Hoogly River between
Calcutta and the sea, when the steamer had to anchor, waiting for the
tide, for four hours in a dead calm.
Two rare and beautiful Yellow Parrakeets--but no specimens of the
ordinary Green Ring-necked Parrakeet--came with the collection

My old pair of these Cranes did not moult their primaries last year,
hut did so this summer.
The young pair, hatched June 1 and 2, 1919, cast all their flight
feathers within a day or two of June 21 last. These have almost
completed the moult into the adult dress, a small patch of fawn-colour
at the base of the neck, between the shoulders, being all that remains
of the nestling plumage, and as they are still moulting small feathers
the change will probably be completed in the next few weeks. The
crimson skin patch on the crown has been already acquired, and
altogether it would seem difficult to distinguish the young bird of
15 to 18 months from the parents. The growth of these young Cranes
from the first has been remarkable.
This season only one young bird was hatched, the other egg being
unfertile, but though only hatched on May 31, and, of course, still in
the fawn-coloured plumage, this bird is now bigger than its mother,
and is probably a male.

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D.
It has been truly said that everybody should have a hobby ; it
occupies the mind, gives one an interest in life, and inasmuch as the
mind exercises an influence over the health of the body, undoubtedly
tends to longevity. Of all hobbies the study of natural history is one
of the most fascinating, and the earlier in life that one takes it up the
more enthusiastic one becomes in its pursuit. 1 began when 7
years old to make a collection of British insects, rearing many of my
specimens from larvae found in the garden, and not a few even from eggs.
Some years ago an elder sister gave me a portrait taken of myself when

I was 8 years old with a small glass ease in my hands containing
part of my first collection of British moths.
As I have stated elsewhere, it was in 1871, when at the seaside with
my wife, scarcity of insect life induced me to collect birds' eggs, and tho
difficulty which I experienced in naming them from the scanty
illustrations in oological works tempted me to bring out a book of my
own which should givo the public a better idea of the immense
variability of birds' eggs. During the few years which I devoted to
making this collection 1 was successful in securing many interesting
variations, both of nests and eggs, many of the latter being illustrated
by myself in my Handbook of British Oology, and by Mr. Frohawk
in Birds&apos; Eggs of the British Isles, reprinted and slightly modified from
British Birds with their Nests and Eggs.
I have always held the opinion that it is the duty of every student
to do his best to add such facts as come to Ins notice to the sum of general
knowledge, and even the most insignificant item added respecting the
life-history of any species should not be ignored as unworthy of record.
We still need much light respecting the causes which produce the
colouring and markings of eggs, and it is only through the collector
that we can hope to acquire information ; we ought not therefore to
regard his labours as frivolous or senselessly mischievous. But
information respecting the variability of eggs is by no means all that
is gained by the collector, for he learns many facts respecting nesting
sites, the habits of birds, their notes, their seasons for nidification,
and if he is fortunate he may add to the facts already known respecting
the nesting-range of the different species ; thus I believe I was the first
to record the nesting of the Blue-headed Wagtail and the Cirl Bunting
in Kent. Dr. Ticehurst also credits me ( Birds of Kent, p. 93) with being
the first to take the nest of the Grey Wagtail in that county, but I
imagined at the time that I had heard of a previous discovery of the nest
in Kent. Perhaps I was mistaken in this supposition. On two
occasions I saw the Great Grey Shrike in that county, and in both
cases during the breeding season, and occurrences of this kind are
interesting even if unimportant.
Of course, the study of bird-life is more instructive than the
acquisition of a collection of eggs, and especially if one only secures

the latter by purchase ; even to see one of our native birds at freedom
for the first time gives one a delightful thrill. I shall not forget the
pleasure with which I caught sight of a Pied Flycatcher about the year
1903, in a wood at West Wickham, nor my astonished delight in 1868
when a Golden Oriole flew across a road in North Devon, although
at that time I had not begun to take a special interest in bird-life.
When one turns one's attention to foreign birds one experiences a
constant succession of thrills, and at first one is tempted to add aviary
to aviary for the pleasure of studying them ; but unhappily this is an
expensive hobby, and it needs much leisure if one is to do justice to it;
and then we grow older, and perchance our purse gets lighter, so that
we reluctantly are compelled to take up some simpler (though perhaps
equally attractive) hobby, such as floriculture. Alas ! I fear that
growing flowers and ferns will not enable me to publish many new or
interesting facts for the benefit of my fellow-creatures, and it is certainly
not likely to help our Society, but where I fail I hope many of our
younger and better equipped members will come to the front for the
advancement of knowledge.
I have no doubt that the pursuit of hobbies lengthens life ; if it
is true that Henry Jenkins, of Ellerton, in Yorkshire, lived to the age
of 169, as stated in the Daily Express for August 27, how many hobbies
did he indulge in, and did they benefit anybody but himself ? If not
his long life was unprofitable to his country.

BRAZILIAN CARIAMAS
Mr. George Chalmers, C.M.Z.S., Superintendent of the St. John
del Rey Mining Co., Ltd., Morro Yelho, Brazil, recently forwarded to
the Zoological Society a pair of Brazilian Cariamas or Seriemas
(Cariama cristala), and sent the following notes on the habits of these
birds :--
" It is hardly necessary to tell you that they feed largely on snakes,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9846185" page_id="10099137"  page_num="190" year="" vol="">
which they quickly kill and then fight over as a rule. The birds are
generally to be found following a # campo ' fire, gobbling up partially
burnt grasshoppers and other insects. They have a very extraordinary
cry, or rather a chorus; when four or five are together they are very

musical and can be heard for a great distance. If you strike a plate or
a saucer with a fork or spoon it generally has the effect of starting the
chorus. They are protected by law in this country, on account of their
snake-killing propensities. To the sportsman they often become a
nuisance, as they are very destructive to young birds. Strange to say,
although essentially ground birds, they often perch at night, but not
always. They have a great fancy for bits of crockery or anything
bright and glittering. Unless they are tame, it is not well to get within
striking distance, as, like the Bittern or the Heron, they are remarkably
quick, and I have heard go for the eye."
Headers of this note will at once be struck by the likeness the
Cariamas show in habit on the one hand to the Secretary Birds of Africa
and on the other to the Screamers of South America. The record of
the Cariamas calling in chorus and being stimulated to do so by the
striking of a plate with a metal implement agrees very closely with what
was said in the last number of the Avicultural Magazine of the
Screamers in the Zoological Gardens being "set off" by the striking
of the clock. The superficial resemblance between Cariamas and
Secretary Birds has been frequently noticed and discussed, but it is
generally considered, I believe, to be purely adaptive and due to
similarity of feeding habits, the Cariamas being aberrant members of
the Crane-group (Gruiformes), whereas the Secretary Birds are aberrant
Accipitres. It is pleasant to learn of the protection extended to these
fine and interesting birds on account of their snake-killing propensities.
The Secretary Birds arc protected in Africa for the same reason.
The Zoological Society now has representatives of the two known
species of Cariama, namely, the one referred to above and the smaller,
darker form, Burmeister's Cariama (C/runga burmeisteri), which comes
from the Argentine. It may be recalled that a pair of Brazilian
Cariamas bred and reared young in the Gardens in 1911 and
1912. Let us hope that this new pair will follow their example. But
the hen bird unfortunately broke one of her legs on the voyage. The
enterprising surgeon on board, however, instead of having the bird
slaughtered, set the shattered limb skilfully in splints, and up to the
present time the operation looks like proving a success.

Some of our Avicultural Society friends may be interested to hear
that in this valley (about 1,200 feet high and 200 miles inland from
Vancouver) I have recently had pointed out to me a Waxwing's nest
consisting (except for small lining) entirely of pieces of fairly thick
string. The nest was in the fork of an apple-tree, and just looked like
an old ball of string. The string used consisted of pieces, each about
2 feet long, which the orchard-owner had used for tying paper bands
on his apple-trees, and had cut off last March and left lying on the
ground. He has watched the nest with great interest.
It is encouraging to learn that the insect-eating birds here have
increased enormously since the apple orchards were planted.
The Mountain Blue Birds, even at this season, are very pretty, while
Hairy, Downy, and other Woodpeckers are surprisingly common. I
am told that the Ruby-throated Humming-birds are a most magnificent
sight when the apple-trees are in full blossom. I had no idea they would
come so far north. A delightful little Duck called " Butter-ball "
(? Bufiie-head) is fairly plentiful on the lakes.

The past summer seems to have been a very poor one for the breeding
of foreign birds; cold and dull weather has prevailed, and this probably
accounts to a great extent for the lack of satisfactory results. In the
Zoological Gardens several species that normally breed have failed to
do so this year. I hope that members will give their experiences.
One gratifying surprise at the Zoo was the breeding of a pair of
rare Francolins in the Western Aviary. Mr. Maurice Portal presented
to the Society a pair of the rare Francolinus spilog aster, from North-
East Africa. The species had never before been represented in the
collection, and the pair was placed in one of the back compartments
of the central portion of the aviary. When they had been there for no

more than two or three weeks the keeper found an egg laid in the sand.
We then supplied a heap of sand in one corner, and some brushwood
so as to form a screen. A second, third, and fourth egg were laid at
different places. These were carefully kept in case the birds should
fix on a definite spot. Later on the hen was discovered sitting tightly
behind the shelter of the brushwood. She was left undisturbed, but
the four eggs previously laid were placed in an incubator. In twenty-
one days the Francolin hatched three chicks, and one egg in the
incubator also hatched, the latter chick being placed with the others.
The four grew well and were reared, though one was taken by a rat
when half-grown.
Another success at the Zoological Gardens has been the breeding
of Gambel's Quail (Coturnix gambeli). A pair of these beautiful birds
arrived with the New York collection in June, and as they appeared
to be in fine condition I decided to put them into the summer aviary
hoping that they might breed. This aviary is thickly planted with
shrubs, and the grass is allowed to grow, so that there is abundant
cover, and the Quails simply disappeared. We saw nothing of them
until one day early in September the hen was seen followed by four
fair-sized chicks.
I had the pleasure in August of visiting the Zoological Gardens in
Edinburgh, and strongly advise every member who has the opportunity
to pay a visit there. The Zoological Park is situated on a hillside, which
is of rock, and by blasting out the rock some very fine natural-looking
enclosures have been made for the animals. The Lion, Polar Bear, and
Sea Lion enclosures are extremely fine. The gardens are not rich in
aviaries or in small birds, but the show of King Penguins is wonderful.
There are six of these magnificent birds, one of which was hatched and
reared in the Gardens, and at the time of my visit two of the birds were
incubating.
The process of incubation in the King and Emperor Penguins is
extraordinary and most interesting. In order to prevent the single
eag becoming chilled on the cold ground of their native habitat, these
Penguins have adopted the novel method of resting the single egg

on the upper surface of their feet. The skin of the abdomen is developed
into a loose flap, which spreads over the egg, completely covering it
and keeping it at the necessary temperature, while the bird remains
in the erect attitude, and if she wishes to change her position she walks
or shuffles along carrying the egg with her.
Many of the older members of the Society will remember Mr. F. C.
Thorpe, who was in business as a dealer in Hull for some years. Most
of us obtained birds from him in those days, and I think he gave
universal satisfaction. He was especially successful in obtaining rare
South American species. Now he is farming in Queensland, and in a
letter to Mr. Barnby Smith he gives a list of the birds seen on his farm,
amongst which are several that are known to aviculturists, such as

Sirs, -- In September I received from Mr.H. E. Rogers a Mocking-bird,
the only specimen that arrived in a consignment of birds from the
Argentine, and I am told that this species is rare there. It is an
extremely graceful bird, of the size of the " common " Mocking-bird
(Minins polyylottus), but the whole colouring is inclined to brown rather
than grey. The head and back are dark brownish, the primaries and
central tail feathers black. A superciliary stripe over the eyes is whitish-
fawn, the underparts sandy fawn, and what is very distinctive, a whitish
line runs from the shoulders to the tips of the secondary wing-feathers,
making a fairly broad and uninterrupted stripe all along the wings.
The outer tail feathers are white. 1 should say the bird is not in
immature plumage. Descriptions are difficult or misleading, but I have
certainly never seen this species of Minins before. I believe it is
M. triurus.
I also received at the same time a pair of Pileated Jays
(why " pileated " ?) but they do not seem to be Cyanocorax chrysops,
which, as far as I can recall, has the underparts white, whereas in my
birds they are champagne, quite genuine, and not a discoloured white,
the upper parts being a beautiful deep blue-violet. They inhabit
Patagonia, I believe.
There is the same lovely spot of turquoise blue over the eyes as in
C. chrysops, and also on the nape of the neck. 1 Mr. Rogers sent me on
approval a pair of " Jays ", which undoubtedly should be called
Magpies. Black head and upper breast, the whole body being very
dark blackish purple. The central tail feathers were broken, but would
evidently be long in the Magpie style.
Hubert D. Astley.
1 They appear to be Cyanocorax azureus : a most absurd name ! There is
nothing azure about them, or any feather approaching that colour, for azure
means an exceedingly bright and pure sky-blue.

NESTING OF ASIATIC WHITE CRANES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998469060606061" page_id="10099143"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- I do not know if the nesting of the two Asiatic White Cranes,
Sacrogeranus leucogeranus, now living opposite the north entrance of
the Zoo, and which arrived in July, 1901, was ever recorded. If not,
such occurred during the time I lived in London (from 1905-1910).
A large collection of dead vegetation (clover, leaves, etc.) was scraped
together, and two eggs laid, the nest being on the ground, and both
birds took part in the incubating. But after sitting for weeks the
eggs were unfertile, which was disappointing, because both male and
female appeared outwardly in good health.
One of them has some blackish feathering running downwards
from the level of the yellow iris and between the joining of the red
beak and face with the white of head, neck, and other parts (except
wings, part black), and this bird would seem to be the male.
Except for this there is nothing (so far as I can see) to distinguish the
sexes, both about the same size and both red-legged, and it therefore
seems worth mentioning as of possible value to some person trying to
breed them in future, they being well-proportioned graceful birds and
an attraction to any scenery where they will live in Britain.
It seems to me as probable that the above failure to fertilize the
eggs was due to some anaemia in one or other parent bird, and should
like to suggest to owners of Cranes that such birds be supplied with
iron in their water ; and also with titbits of food at intervals to improve
and keep the blood in good condition. As showing how fussy these
Cranes are at times, I watched the female of the above pair in the Zoo
pick out a piece of grass apparently too soiled for its liking in that
condition, and give it three long washings in the drinking-water,
extending over about four minutes ! At the end of this it was satisfied
with it and ate it -- afterwards eating much grass without washing !

Sirs,-- My surprise was great when on going to the aviaries on
September 27 I saw clinging to the wire meshing a beautiful young
budgerigar, snow-white with faint blue markings. It had come from
a nest-box where there were two others, both blue. It is a male bird,
very robust, and in beautiful condition. When the blue cere is fully
coloured it will look charming in contrast to the white plumage. The
small patches on the cheeks are also blue, the eyes dark brown. The
shoulders are very faintly marked with pale blue, and there is a flush
(if one can apply the word to blue) of the same tint on the rump ; but
the general appearance is snowy white. The parents are blue.

Sirs, -- -Withreference to Dr Hopkinson's remarks on the Himalayan
Siskin, Mr. Teschemaker could probably give more details than I am
able to do, as he has, I believe, bred both S. tibetanus and //. spinoides.
One year we were both successful in breeding them, and
Mr. Teschemaker sent me a pair of his young birds, with a view to an
exchange. These were distinctly smaller than my youngsters, and of
a different colour, which makes me think that my birds were of the
larger variety, Ii. spinoides. However, I recently sent a clutch of eggs
laid in my aviary to a well-known collector, who tells me that they do
not correspond with a clutch he received direct from India. Both this
year and last season I reared some very pretty hybrids from a cock
Goldfinch and one of my hens. The cocks make good singers.

THE COST OF THE MAGAZINE
At a meeting of the Council held on October 25. the Hon. Treasurer
referred to the enormous increase that had taken place in the cost of
producing the AvicuUural Magazine, and the probability of a deficit
at the end of the year in spite of the present reduced size of the journal
and the lack of illustrations. It was decided that there should be no
increase in the amount of the subscription, but the hope teas expressed
that those members who saw their wag to do so would send a donation to
the funds of the Soeictg , and so help to tide over a very difficult period.
The Council decided that in future no free advertisements should be
inserted in the &quot; Members&apos; Sale &quot; column.

By W. H. St. Quintin
How many aviculturists must regret the old pre-War days, and
perhaps some of us think that we did not then always make the best use
of our opportunities (I refer only to aviculture !). I can't help feeling
that if I had taken a little more pains with a beautiful pair of Wall-
creepers (Tichodroma muraria), which came into my possession in
July, 1913, I might have succeeded better with them. They had been
moulted out twice, I was told, in an aviary on Lake Constance. The
female was in very heavy moult, and her movements were considerably
handicapped for several weeks, but by the end of November I noted that
she was as active as the male. I realized from the first that opportunity
for exercise was all-important, and 1 tried to provide a substitute for
perpendicular rocks by setting up planks and slabs of wood at various
angles, on which gravel and stones were fixed by cement, crevices and
holes being imitated to the best of my ability. It was easy to take these
down to be cleaned when necessary, which was an advantage. The birds
used these sham rocks freely, showing their lovely crimson wings as they
moved about in characteristic fashion, by short leaps. Unlike the
Woodpeckers and true Creepers, they made no use of the tail as a support
(the feathers of which are too slender and soft for such a purpose).
But still there was something wanting. I now see that I ought to
have arranged two or more masses of real or imitation masonry, with

ample flying space between, and perhaps in addition some heaps of
stones and old mortar, amidst which their live food might have been
scattered. I was deceived by the apparently excellent health of the
birds, and did not pay sufficient regard to the consequence of high
feeding and a sedentary life ! I continued the diet which they were
accustomed to before they came to me, a German mixture for soft-
billed birds, first quality dried ants&apos; 1 " eggs ", and fresh ones, while
procurable, as well as wasp-grubs, gentles, and mealworms. Of the
latter they probably had too many, for it was hard to resist the
temptation to call up the beautiful creatures, which were always
watching one's hand and ready to take the tempting morsel from
one's fingers.
I kept the male for exactly a year. Early in February he began to
assume the dark feathers on back and throat characteristic of the
breeding plumage, and all seemed promising. But in June he became
lame, with swollen toes, and though I reduced the more stimulating food
he remained unwilling to move about, seeming altogether amiss, and
on July 30 he was found dead. " A clot of blood on the brain, diseased
feet, but organs healthy," was the report after the post-mortem
examination. The female survived till two months later, dying from
the same malady, to my great regret.
The bird has a wide range, from the Spanish Sierra, across Europe
and Asia, to the Himalayas and China, and specimens from the different
mountain ranges, I believe, show no variation. In the high Alps it may
be looked for wherever there are extensive limestone precipices. Its
unusual way of working along the perpendicular cliffs by short leaps,
keeping its breast to the rock and expanding and closing its crimson
wings with successive jerks, catches one's eye at once. In fact, the little
bird appears to disdain the principle of protective colouring, for while
the rest of the plumage harmonizes well with the grey rocks, the
apparently needless display of the bright colour every time the wings
are opened must often expose it to danger. Amongst the likely places
for the bird are the perpendicular rocks of the Gemmi Pass and the
precipice near the Kur promenade at Lenkerbad, at both of which places
I have seen it. I once found Wall-creepers breeding at the entrance
to the Trift Thai, near Zermatt, and watched the male feeding his mate

in a crevice, as I thought, dangerously near the footpath, but over-
hanging the torront. On July 12,1904, in the gorge of the Bernina-back
at Pontresina, close to the village, and just above the old bridge, T saw
a male feeding the female in a chink of the rock, while several of the
first brood were foraging for themselves, and now and then came into
sight. My friends and I frequently visited the place and could stand
down by the water with the nest only some 30 feet above us. But we
had to be careful, for the river-bank is a favourite promenade. However,
so far as we could tell, no one save ourselves had noticed the birds. In
1913, after the extension of the Bernina railway and much blasting of
the rock, and many changes in and about the gorge, I looked for the
Wall-creepers in vain.

SOME NOTES ON PESQUET'S PARROT
(DAS YPT1L US PESOUETI)
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9928822" page_id="10099148"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
By the Marquess of Tavistock
Seeing that practically nothing has been recorded of the habits
of this strange Parrot from New Guinea, and that only two examples
appear to have ever reached Europe alive, a few notes on my bird
may be of some scientific and avicultural interest.
Dasyptilus pesqueti is about the size of a Greater Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo--perhaps a little larger--and the head and beak have a
remarkably close resemblance to these of a Turkey Buzzard. The
greater part of the plumage is black, some of the smaller feathers being
edged with grey. The thighs, lower breast, and abdomen are scarlet,
as are portions of the outer and inner wing coverts and the web of part
of a few flight feathers. The tongue is pale pink like that of a human
being, the eyes large and dark, and the feet and bill blackish.
In dealing with an entirely new bird food is apt to be a bit of a
difficulty. The Pesquet had been brought over on the food usually
supplied to Lories, but as his tongue was not that of a honey-eater
I thought it advisable to get him on to a more solid diet. Seed, grain,
greenstuff, and boiled carrot he absolutely refused to touch, but he took
quite readily to banana and moistened sponge-cake. This now con-
stitutes his principal diet, though an attempt to discontinue the liquid

food altogether was not attended with satisfactory results, as fruit
alone does not appear to keep him in condition.
From the time of his arrival the Pesquet has been extremely tame,
but he is only really friendly with the person who feeds him, showing
considerable hostility to strangers, especially when he is feeling a little
out of sorts. At such times he ruffles his feathers like an angry hen,
half opens his wings, and advances upon the intruder, cursing him
harshly. He very seldom tries to fly, but climbs about actively with the
whisking motions of a Lory. His voice, as Gilbert White said of the
Peacocks, " is grating and shocking to the ear ; the screeching of cats
and the braying of a jackass are not more disgustful." In other words
he makes a noise something like a combination of a heron and one of
those rattles with which college spectators at a boat-race are wont to
encourage the crews and give vent to the exuberance of their own
spirits. He also imitates with great power and fidelity the harsh,
grating screams of my black Cockatoos.
Some weeks ago I turned the Pesquet into an outdoor aviary ; he
hugely enjoyed his first sform of rain, but incessant deluges and cold
nights disagreed with him and I was obliged to take him indoors.
Next year, perhaps, he will do better, after moulting in confinement and
getting more used to our climate. His behaviour towards other birds
is quite commendable, for though he snaps at them when they come near
him I think he does so more from nervousness than vice; indeed, on
one occasion he showed praiseworthy restraint when a Budgerigar, little
larger than his beak, disputed the possession of the feeding-tray with
him. By the way, some of the smallest Parrots have a surprising amount
of cheek ; I once had a Blue-winged Lovebird who indignantly repelled
a shorthorn cow who approached her !
Take him all round, Dasyptilus pesqueti is not a bad bird for an
aviculturist who likes an uncommon pet. He is handsome in his
peculiar way, intelligent, full of character, and capable of great affection
for his owner; probably he could be taught to talk, as he seems to have
the imitative faculty, and he is quite sensible enough to learn that his
natural cry is more suitable for New Guinea than for civilized society !

By Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
I obtained at the beginning of November a pair of Cat-birds, a
true pair, which is a rare importation. Structurally and in general
appearance the JEluroedi are closely allied to the Bower-birds, which
are relatives of the Birds of Paradise. M. viridis is the size of an
English Jay, the general colour being grass-green, spotted with dull
white. The eyes are large, the male's being bright reddish-brown,
the female&apos;s rather lighter.
Gould asserts that the Cat-birds have never been found to
construct any bowers, but the nest is a beautiful structure, bowl-
shaped, and entwined round with the large broad leaves of certain
trees on a base of twigs, the leaves evidently being picked when
fresh. The interior is lined with fine twigs. This Cat-bird inhabits
the coastal ranges of New South Wales and Southern Queensland. It is
plentiful in Kambewarra and the Kangaroo Valley, or was when
Gould wrote of it. Let us hope it is still the case, since the species
is evidently protected by law.
This bird derives its name from the fact that its loud cries (which
I have not yet hoard) resemble the caterwauling of cats on the tiles !
Fortunately I imagine this concert is not performed by night on the
part of the birds. Mine may perhaps not be in fully adult plumage,
for the white spotting is neither as clear or as large as is depicted in
both Gould's and Elliot's family of the Paradise Birds.
At present I keep my Cat-birds in a roomy wicker cage, but next
spring if all goes well I hope to turn them into an aviary. They are
very active, taking long jumps from perch to perch without opening
their wings, and their expressions are decidedly intelligent.
Personally I admire their neat appearance and comparatively
sober colouring more than that of some of the Paradise Birds, which
are inclined to look like over-dressed women and to be clumsy in
movement, which the Cat-birds are certainly not. They are fed on an
inseetile mixture, with banana, apple, white grapes, and a little raw
meat. Tliev are very fond of mealworms, although it is said that in

a wild state they prefer fruit to insects. The female resembles the
male in a cursory glance, but on more careful inspection one discerns
a difference in the size of the head, eyes, and bill, and the male
has a more definite white mark on the sides of the neck, besides which
in him the breast spots extend further down the abdomen. The bill
is very light horn-green, the legs and feet bluish-grey. The head is
rather large, and the bill Jay-like in shape.
There are at least seven or eight other species of AElurcedus, all
having grass-green upper parts and some with black cheek patches
and more profusely or definitely spotted on breast and shoulders with
white. My birds are not at all wild, and the female will take banana
from my hand. Both aj)pear as if in time they will become quite
tame. The only vocal sound I have heard has been uttered by the
male, which almost exactly resembles the sharp " tsit ! tsit! " of
the red Cardinal, which that bird utters as an alarm note.

An Australian Board of Control has been established, consisting of

of Australia, with the object of collecting specimens of the Australian
Fauna for exhibition purposes and disposing of them abroad either by
means of sale or exchange.
The Board hope soon to be in a position to supply any mammal,

The Board is fortunate in having the advantage of the very best
expert advice and the most up-to-date methods for the housing of stock,
together with ideal surroundings and conditions which ensure their
comfort and health, and with the facilities at their disposal they can
give a guarantee of safe delivery in the very best condition of any

extinct or is of direct economic use to. the country.
'' The opening up of the country by settlement, the introduction of
the fox, Starling, and Sparrow, the exploitation of the fauna by dealers,
all tend to give the birds a hard battle for it, and some species are on the
verge of extinction, more especially the small ground Parrots, genus
Neophema, two of which, the Chestnut-shouldered (Turquoisine) and the
Scarlet-chested (Splendid), have not until this year been noted for many
years, and were thought to be quite extinct, but, happily, a small
flock of each species was seen this season. Their appearance at once
put the dealers on the alert, and big prices were offered for them, some
Chestnut-shouldered being actually exported to America, which, as
far as we know, may have been the last of their race ; so you will well
understand the necessity for control by the Customs, State Governments,
and the Control Board.
" Another phase of the question is that a case occurred recently
where thousands of birds were caught in the open season under permit,
shipped away alive, and then killed for the plumage trade.

zoological institutions and legitimate aviary keepers will be able to get

Sirs, --When in the London Zoological Gardens in August last I spent
some time in watching two Pileated Jays (Cyanocorax cJtrysops) from
La Plata, in the Western Aviary. There was something about these Jays
which attracted and fascinated me as they j limped about on the ground
by a series of high hops, and one incident was especially interesting
to watch.

Ono bird was sitting on a bough and had been resting there for
several minutes, the other hopping along the ground. The latter then
flew up and clung to the wire dividing the compartment from
the next one, holding there for about half a minute, during which
time the one on the bough was still. The bird on the bough then opened
its beak wide and began at once to shake its plumage rapidly all over,
keeping up such shaking for about thirty seconds, and when it was about
half-way through this performance the bird on the wire flew down and
put its beak inside the other bird's beak. After this the birds remained
so for about fifteen seconds, the one shaking as previously described,
but the bird which approached did not do so, nor display any extra-
ordinary emotion. Was the bird which shook the male ? There was
nothing carried that I could see in the beak of the approaching bird, and
although I watched for the next hour there was no further placing
of beaks within one another, although the bird (which had originally
been hunting along the ground) returned and kept picking up bits of
food thrown in by visitors, some of which it swallowed. Neither was
there any more shaking of plumage and such like during next day when
I watched them. Was the above a " courting display " ? If male and
female, the sexes were equal in size and showed no difference in plumage
that I could see.
The yellow iris showed up markedly against the black beak, head,
upper breast, and neck, while a bright blue patch above each eye and
also at back of neck made the birds more attractive ; the back and
wings having a dark metallic blue shade, as also the tail with white tip.
When the bird shook these parts showed more brightly. As a contrast
to these darker parts the white lower breast, abdomen, and vent showed
up prominently. When cracking nuts they held these firmly with both
feet close together, and split them by pecks from beak&apos;s point, much
like the Nutcracker ( Nucifraga).
Frederick D. Welch.
[The habit of interlocking beaks appears to be characteristic of the
Corvidae. I recently watched a pair of Ravens so engaged for a con-
siderable time, the bill of the male inserted in that of his mate. They
are a most affectionate pair of birds and were evidently love-making.--

HUME'S WHITE-EARED BULBUL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995655764705882" page_id="10099155"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
Sirs,-- In the current number of the Avicullural Magazine,
I notice among the list of the Zoological Society's Indian collection
the " White-cheeked " and the " White-eared " Bulbuls. May I
inquire whether Malpastes humii, Hume's White-eared Bulbul,
has ever been imported ? In 1909 I found this bird plentiful near
Jhelum and Tangrat, and have no doubt that it could easily be
procured, as my friends and I caught several of them. Oates
described this bird from a single specimen in the British Museum,
and owing to this fact the bird as a distinct species has probably been
overlooked. That it is a distinct species I think there can be no
doubt.
Raymond W. Cooper.
[Hume's White-eared Bulbul may well have been imported and
overlooked by aviculturists, who rarely know the exact localities
from which their birds are derived, and are not so quick to observe
minute details of colouring and so forth as are the Cabinet
ornithologists. --Eds.]

Sirs,-- Mr. Astley's note on p. 195 concerning " Pileated Jays "
was the cause of my looking up the somewhat scanty literature I have
here at my disposal on the identity of a pair of Pileated Jays, which
I also purchased from Mr. Rogers, under the impression that my birds
were Cyanocorax chrysops. I was merely waiting for the birds, who
have now moulted well, to rear some young next year.
The species I am referring to may well be called " pileated &apos;, if by

this one means carrying a small excrescence of feathers in the occipital
region. The head and upper neck are black; there is a small turquoise-
blue superciliary line; breast and under-parts pure white and back ashy
brown ; tail and flight feathers black, the former showing the circular
white spot common to a good many Jays and Pies. These birds are
obviously less beautiful than Mr. Astley's, but they are most amusing
clowns, and have very well-developed ventriloquial powers; this is
particularly well demonstrated in the male when a titbit, such as a
mouse or sparrow, is put on the feeding-tray. It is obviously his
method of calling the hen's attention to the coming feast.
May I respectfully point out to Mr. Astley that the Azure Jay is
usually known as C. cceruleus, and not azureus, a much more fitting
if somewhat vague specific name.

CHESTNUT-WINGED STARLINGS

<bodyText confidence="0.998714538461538" page_id="10099156"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
Sirs, --At Gamage's there were not long ago several individuals of
a species which was called the Chestnut-winged Starling. I believe
these birds to be Amydrus fulvipennis. Tristram discovered in
Palestine A. tristrami, which very closely resembles the African
species, so much so that at first it was thought to be identical. This
Palestinian Amydrus was found amongst the cliffs and desert rooks
in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea, in the gorge of the Kedron.
I have a pair of A. fulvipennis, and very handsome these birds are
In size, that of a rather large Blackbird ( Merula ) ; the male, glossy
black with green reflections and chestnut primaries, the female having
a dark ash-grey head and body of duller black than the male's, but
with the same primaries of chestnut. These birds utter a loud,
flute-like note, which is decidedly musical. The tail is rather wedge-

shaped, and the bill strong and sharply pointed. A. fulvipennis
inhabits S.W. and S. Africa.
Hubert D. Astley.
[It is difficult to identify these birds by the names used by
Mr. Astley, but most probably the South African species he refers
to is Amydrus morio, while that from Palestine is Hagiopsartristrami,
of which species the late Canon Tristram presented several living
specimens to the late Lord Lilford many years ago.-- Eds.]

Monthly, Is. 9 d. ; yearly, 20s.
British Birds maintains its very high standard of excellence, and
in spite of the present cost of production is able to publish some very
fine photographs. In the October number Miss E. L. Turner con-
tributes an article on the Haunt of the Black-tailed Godwit, with
some first-rate photographs of this bird nesting on the sand-dunes
which protect Holland from the North Sea, while in the November
number the same author writes on the Black Tern, and illustrates her
paper with some even more striking pictures. Mr. A. H. Machell Cox
contributes " Some Notes on the Nesting of the Nuthatch " ;
Mr. Charles E. Alford writes on Diving Ducks, from observations
made along the coast of the North Pacific, and supplies some valuable
records of the period of submersion. Dr. N. F. Ticehurst gives some
early records of the Crane in Kent, while Mr. A. W. Boyd contributes
a most interesting record of the appearance of a flock of Glossy
Ibises in Cornwall last September, and other writers record examples
seen in Devon and Herefordshire.

The French Avicultural Journal, L&apos;Oiseau, ably conducted by our
member, Monsieur J. Delacour, continues to produce excellent
articles as well as first-rate illustrations. The September and October
numbers contain accounts by M. Delacour of the Gang-gang Cockatoo,
the first containing a coloured plate of the male and the second of the
female ; the plates, by Mons. A. Millot, are beautifully drawn and
faithfully reproduced, and represent the two sexes in very
characteristic attitudes. Two very good text-figures are also given.
Mons. Delacour has a pair of these Cockatoos, which show signs of
breeding if all goes well with them until next summer.
Other articles deal with the Dipper and Cuckoo in captivity, and
the fine hybrid produced by mating together the Mikado and
Elliot&apos;s Pheasants.

The Hon. Treasurer begs to acknowledge with many thanks the
following donations to the General Expenses Fund :--
A. Ezra, Esq. ..... #10 0 0
Sydney Porter, Esq. . . . 10 0
He would like to take this opportunity of asking all those members
who can to help even with a very small donation. The cost of the
Magazine in its restricted and unillustrated form has risen from
#13 to #29 per month, so that unless members assist it will be
impossible to carry on for more than another year without raising the
subscription, which the Council are loth to do. The Council and
Editors fully realize that the Magazine is not what they would and
could make it had they more funds at their disposal, but they hope
that for this year members will remember the present purchasing
value of a sovereign, and make an effort in spite of the difficulties
of the times to keep the Magazine devoted to their hobby afloat. The
balance-sheet when made up and audited next month will be available
for inspection by any member who cares to see it, but for reasons
of economy it will not be printed and circulated. All donations will
be duly acknowledged in the Magazine.
