</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.982917095238095" page_id="56211415"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
The single example of this splendid Touraco, which is scientifically
known as Corythceola cristata, now in the Zoological Gardens, has
already been referred to in this Journal (1928, p. 186), but it is such
a magnificent bird and appears to be so very well suited to avicultural
conditions, that the coloured plate, herewith published, will be welcomed
by our members.
This is the largest of the Touracos, its total length being about
28 inches, and unlike most of its allies it lacks the well-known carmine
features in the wings. It inhabits West Africa from Senegambia to
Angola and Equatorial Africa, and as with all of the family is very
arboreal in its habits, keeping to the forests and rarely descending to
the ground. It feeds almost entirely upon fruit.
Touracos are nearly always tame when brought to this country,
the reason being that the easiest method of obtaining them is by hand-
rearing them from the nest, and they certainly respond to this method
of treatment well, for they seem to be easily reared and they certainly
make most charming aviary birds. Contrary to the general rule,
the Donaldson's Touracos that were imported in considerable numbers
some few years ago were not at all tame, and had evidently been
captured adult.
Touracos build open nests like those of Pigeons, though apparently

better concealed and it is surprising that so few instances are on record
of any of the species being bred in captivity. It appears that Turacus
persa and T. macrorhynchus are the only two that has succeeded in
this direction so far.
Touracos appear to be decidedly intelligent birds, judging from
the fact that the Blue Touraco which is the subject of our plate always
recognizes its late owner when he visits the Zoological Gardens, though
he may not have been in the neighbourhood for many months. The
bird shows the greatest pleasure immediately his late master calls
him, flying down to him. at once and delighting in his caresses.

One of the saddest things in the life of a keen ornithologist is to see
so many wonderful species of birds being exterminated. Creatures
whose development and evolution have taken thousands if not millions
of years are now by one stroke, comparatively speaking, swept by the
ruthless hand of Man into oblivion. They can never be brought back
or restored to their place on the earth. The destruction of a work of
art whether wilfully or by accident calls for a great outcry, but no
work created by the hand of Man is as valuable as any species created
by Nature, no matter how mean it may appear to our eyes, and yet
scarcely a voice is raised to protest against the terrible destruction
of species which is going on to-day. Why is it that so many species
are vanishing ? and why has Man dealt so unjustly with his fellow-
creatures ? Sometimes it has been because of the feeble and perverted
instinct of sport when it consists of the death of a living creature,
sometimes the vanity of savages or of civilized woman, the greed of
gain, and perhaps more than anything for food. This especially
applies to birds which have been confined to small and isolated islands.
Man has taken up his abode on these places and soon the creatures
are no more. Many hundreds have gone and a great many are still
going.

Sydney Porter--Notes on Bare Parrots of the Genus Amazon a B
The extirpation of the fine avifauna of New Zealand, the Parrakeets
of Australia, the birds of the Galapoges Islands, the game birds of
North America, the Pigeons of the islands of the Indian Ocean, and
last but not least the beautiful Parrots of the genus Amazona which
inhabit the islands of the West Indies, are slowly but surely going
and for all these the long list has to be debited against the hand of
civilized man.
It is to do with some of the nearly extirpated species of the latter
birds that I have to speak mainly here. The birds form the remnant
of a large number of Parrots which have long since disappeared from
most of the islands.
Guildings Parrot (Amazona guildingi)
Whilst on my way to Barbados I was fortunate in meeting with
a gentleman who for many years had been a magistrate in St. Yincent
and who knew A. guildingi very well. He stated that it was still
found in small numbers in the virgin forests on the mountain tops
which are still unexplored. He himself has seen them there. He
informed me that the natives sometimes get them by marking out
their roosting trees and climbing up at night when the birds are asleep.
The birds were not killed by the eruption as many people thought,
but quite a few were swept to their doom by a recent hurricane. Their
scarcity is not so much due to the fact that the birds are killed but that
they are very slow breeders, laying only one or two eggs. The natives
are said to climb a tree sometimes if they know where there is a nest
and secure the young bird which they hand-rear. I was informed
by the said gentleman that it was very likely I could secure a bird
or even a pair if I could visit St. Yincent and make a journey up into
the mountains with a native hunter. In the island the bird is known as
the Bronze Parrot.
It was my intention to visit St. Vincent in search of this bird,
but owing to my staying for a longer time in the island of Dominica
than I first anticipated, the visit had to be cancelled much to my
regret. Whilst in Barbados I heard that someone had a yellow Parrot
from St. Yincent, but though I made numerous enquiries I failed
to locate it.

When on one of the steamers from New York going down the
Islands I had the good lnck to meet the new Administrator of St. Vincent
going to take up his duties on the island. He was very keen on the
protection of the bird and said that upon taking office he would make
enquiries into the matter of the bird and do his utmost to afford it
all possible protection.
There is an interesting article in a paper entitled the Birds of the
Southern Lesser Antilles, published by the Boston Society of Natural
History, from which the following is quoted :--
" This bird (A. guilddngi) is now decidedly rare on St. Vincent
where it is confined to the highest wooded slopes in the centre of the
island behind Barrouallie. Some idea of its scarcity may be had from
the fact that during a walk from Hermitage, in the upper Cumberland
valley, south along the central ridge of the island, only two were met
with, although it is in this region that they are said to be most common.
I stayed for four days in the Bichmond valley near Morne Garou
where many Parrots had previously been obtained, but neither saw
nor heard one. Formerly it was very numerous, and was still common
at the time of the great hurricane (1898). In that storm many were
destroyed ; two were picked up dead on the shores of St. Lucia and
a considerable number were disabled and caught by the natives. For
days after the storm Parrots would be found in the smaller towns
in a more or less helpless condition due probably to hunger, for, as
has been previously stated, the woods at that time were practically
barren.
" Before the species had recovered to any extent from the effects
of the hurricane, the late eruptions occurred and probably killed
many of the birds, as that part of the island best suited to them was
laid waste.
" . . . Mr. J. T. Thorne, until lately a magistrate in Demerara,
who lived many years ago in St. Vincent, told me that a pair of these
Parrots nested in an old estate chimney near Kingston and that two
young birds were obtained from the nest."
So from that we can gather that the birds only lay a small clutch
of eggs.

The Versicolour Parrot (Amazona versicolor)
During my trip I stayed for an all too short period in the lovely
island of St. Lucia, the home of one of the large " Amazon " Parrots
which some years ago was on the verge of extinction, and it was a great
delight to hear from many people that it has now increased and is
still increasing fairly rapidly, thanks to the very rigid protection
afforded it by the Government of the island.
The natives in the country districts are terrified of killing or even
owning a bird, the authorities having been able to instil into the native
mind a great fear on this question, I wish the Dominican Government
would do the same about the Imperial Parrot. I, unfortunately, did
not see any wild birds myself, but I was taken into the districts where
they lived and found by questioning the natives that the birds were
now fairly common. In fact, on our trip one place was pointed out
to me, a place where flocks of about twenty Parrots passed each
morning to their feeding-grounds, and one fellow offered to go into the
woods and shoot me a pair, just wounding them, so that they would
live (so he said) on condition I took all the blame if he were found out !
It is needless to say what my answer was, for apart from being against
the Law the birds were breeding and no doubt he might have killed
a dozen to procure two.
I went all over the island trying to secure a tame one but in vain.
I had one or two false alarms : in one case I motored to the other
side of the island and climbed half-way up a mountain to an isolation
hospital, but the bird proved to be a Yellow-fronted Amazon. I
spoke to the police sergeant in charge of the district where the birds
are found, and he informed me that the natives once kept the birds
and even shot numbers for eating, but now they were far too frightened
of the severe penalties to touch the birds. All this was a great joy
to me, to find that at last one of the very rare giants of the genus
Amazona was on the increase in spite of St. Lucia being a very small
island with an increasing population.
Through the kindness of a gentleman who resided on the island
and who asked me up to his place near Castries, I was able to see
a very fine pair of these birds, one of which he had had for over sixteen
years and the other for eight. They were perfectly tame and had

complete liberty, and the strange thing was that the hen (the older
bird) had forsaken her real mate and had mated with a fine bine and
yellow Macaw which was also at liberty. These birds were all perfectly
tame, and I obtained many photos of them, but unfortunately they
were all ruined owing to keeping them too long in a humid climate.
The owner of the birds said that so strict is the protection of these
Parrots that he had to obtain a permit from the authorities in order
that he might retain possession of them.
Twenty years ago the bird was for all intents and purposes practically
extinct, and the remarkable increase shows what can be done with the
most stringent protection.
The Cayman Island Parrot {Amazona caymanensis )
Among the islands of the West Indies which possess a Parrot of
their own, the Cayman Islands are the smallest and most isolated
group which can lay claim to this distinction. This small group
of islands lie over 200 miles north-west of Jamaica and the total
area of the whole group is only 89 square miles, which will show
that they are very tiny indeed. They are very isolated and visitors
are few and far between owing to there being no regular steamer service.
Every now and then a few natives of the islands come over in their
small craft to Jamaica to trade, bringing with them dried fish, turtles,
and sometimes a few of the indigenous Parrots which they have taken
from the nest and hand-reared.
These birds are much rarer than the Yellow-billed Parrot of Jamaica,
and they always command a high price in the Jamaica market, any-
thing from 30s. to #3 being asked for them, which though seeming to
be .a reasonable price in this country is very high for a Parrot in the
tropics.
A. caymanensis is one of the smaller so-called " Amazon " Parrots,
but at the same time is one of the most beautiful. In colour it is
the usual green, but rather darker than most of the genus, the feathers
being heavily edged with black, the front half of the head is white
tinged with yellow, and rose-pink on the eyebrows, the cheeks and
throat a delicate rose-pink, the wing feathers a bright blue, and those
of the tail marked with bright orange-red. Some specimens have the

breast a rich vinous red colour, but I think this is a question of age
as the ordinary ones all have the bases of the feathers that colour,
but this is concealed until the bird puffs its feathers out.
I picked up a specimen of this Parrot in Jamaica which proved to
be very tame but had a bad habit of biting very hard upon occasion.
It loved human companionship and would play like a kitten with the
sailors on board, but it was very vicious towards other Parrots so had
to be caged by itself.
Another specimen was offered to me for sale which had the breast
almost entirely red. This bird was stated to be a very good talker,
but as the price asked was very excessive I did not purchase it.
Upon arrival in England my bird was turned into an indoor aviary
with other Parrots. At first it lost nearly all its playfulness and
became extremely aggressive towards the other Parrots, especially
the Imperial, which was at least three times as large. While being
quite fearless it refused to be touched, and delighted to creep up behind
one and give a nasty nip or pull out a beak full of hair from one's head.
It seemed far more intelligent than any of the other Parrots. It is
certainly one of the most beautiful of the smaller Amazon " Parrots
and, unlike the majority of its fellow species in captivity, uses its wings
a great deal.
This bird, 1 understand, like its congenitors from the other islands,
is rapidly on the way to extermination, which is not surprising con-
sidering that it is confined to the tiny islands, which are comparatively
well populated. The wonder is that it has managed to survive so long.
Extremely intelligent and inquisitive this Parrot reminds me more
of a dog than a bird. As soon as the aviary door is opened in the
morning, it will fly out into the birdroom, flying back and forwards
until it is tired, when it returns to the aviary. Sometimes it will go
round the other cages and aviaries, pulling out wires and knocking
down pots and tins, for no matter how firmly a pot is fastened it will
pull it out and haul it to the ground. If another aviary door be open
it will enter and make a short tour of inspection.
It is the only species of " Amazon " which I possess which bathes
freely. The other birds like to be sprayed, but this one loves to roll
in the water pot and get thoroughly soaked. This bird is extremely

fond of elder-berries. When I first had it, it would screech terribly
if thwarted of anything, but now it seldom if ever uses its voice.
The Jamaican Yellow-billed Parrot (Amazona collaria) is
perhaps the smallest and among the dullest coloured of the
" Amazons At present, judging by the numbers in the Jamaica
market, it is fairly plentiful, which shows that it must have increased
of late years, for in Gosse's time, over eighty years ago, he states that
the bird was much rarer than the Black-billed Parrot, a bird which
appears to be extinct now.
Most of the specimens which come into the Jamaica market are
taken from the nest when fledglings and hand-reared by the natives.
Gosse says of this bird : " The Yellow-bill is less common than
either of the two preceding but its habits are the same. The same
fruits supply it with food, but in addition, it divides the oranges to
procure the pips, and even cuts the acrid cashew-nut to extract the
kernel, which the others will not do.
" The present and preceding species build in holes in lofty trees ;
often a hollow bread-nut tree is chosen, and often the capacious and
comfortable cavity chiselled out by a Woodpecker. Pour eggs are
usually laid ; and when the green feathers begin to clothe the callow
heads of the promising family, they are too often taken by some daring
youth, who having watched the parent to her hole, climbs the giddy
elevation. He feeds the young with ripe plantain or banana, till they
approach maturity and their appetites can digest plainer food, for
when grown they will eat almost anything.".
A bird which I possess is a gentle little creature with very large
and expressionate eyes but appears shyer and not nearly so intelligent
as its relative and neighbour, the Cayman Islander. This bird was
in nestling plumage when I purchased it, but it has since moulted into
the adult garb. I am endeavouring to get more of these birds, and if
I am successful I hope to breed them.
The Jamaican Black-billed or All-green Parrot (Amazona
agilis) seems to have joined the vast throng of extinct West Indian
birds banished from the earth by the cruel and thoughtless hand of
Man. Whilst in Jamaica for a short time I made every enquiry
respecting it and tried to obtain it, but I got the same answer from
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.97752625" page_id="56211407"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
Sydney Porter--Notes on Bare Parrots of the Genus Amazona 9
all the natives who traded in birds : " No Black-bills, Sar, none
for years, all gone." It is sad to think that this species has been
exterminated, for in Gosse's time it was even commoner than the
Yellow-bill, a bird which, as I have mentioned before, can still be
obtained in the Jamaica market. Though boasting of no brilliant
colours like some of the " Amazons " it was clad in a very beautiful
shade of dark glossy green. I wonder why this bird has disappeared
while its near relative and neighbour the Yellow-bill has survived,
especially as the latter was more sought after than the former ? Again,
at the risk of tiring the reader, I will quote a short chapter from Gosse's
Birds of Jamaica concerning this species, for we might as well give
the bird a good obituary notice !
" All the Parrots are gregarious, cunning, watchful, noisy,
mischievous ; and thus are like the Monkeys. This and the following
species are so much alike in manners and general appearance that a
description of one applies nearly to the other.
" Flocks varying from half a dozen to twenty or thirty fly hither
and thither over the forest, screeching as they go, and all alight together
on some tree covered with berries. Here they feast, but with caution ;
on a slight alarm one screams and the whole flock take wing, vociferous
if not musical; and brilliant if not beautiful; particularly when the
sun shines on their green backs and crimsoned wings. They generally
prefer lofty trees except when, in June, the ripe yellow plantain tempts
them to descend or when the black berry shines upon the pimento.
Of the latter the flocks devour an immense quantity, and the former
they destroy by cutting it to pieces with their powerful beaks to get
at the small seeds."
Bodin's Parrot (Amazona bodini )
Notes on individual birds in captivity, especially Parrots, are liable
to be misleading, for specimens differ in their nature as much as human
beings do. But seeing that this bird is so very rare, very few skins
even being possessed by museums, I may be forgiven for adding a
few notes in regard to my pet bird.
I picked up this bird when in Trinidad. An old woman had a
couple of Parrots, a Yellow-fronted and the Bodin's ; she was sitting

by one of the docks endeavouring to sell the birds to sailors who passed
by. She was very anxious to get rid of the latter bird for it wasn't
in very good plumage and didn't talk, and when she thought that
I wasn't interested she quickly dropped her price from 25s. to 15s.
This bird proved to be a sweet, gentle little creature, perhaps the
tamest Parrot I have ever possessed, delighting to come on one's
shoulder, nestling up against one's neck, and gently playing with one's
ear. She, for it is a hen, never in moments of excitement gives one
a good nip like most other Parrots do. She is fond of being put out
in the garden on warm days, when she will imitate all manner of
animals--cats, dogs, fowls, etc.--and holds long unintelligible con-
versations with herself.
The chief beauty of this bird lies in the lovely crimson back, which
can only be seen when it flies. Though the bird is often out in the
garden all day it never wanders away. It is very fond of bathing in
the wet foliage or of rolling over in the grass during a shower.
This bird inhabits some parts of Venezuela, but nothing seems to
be known of it in the wild state.
The Yellow-cheeked Parrot (Amazona autumnalis)
Costa Pica is said to boast of having the most beautiful women
in the whole world, but whether this is so or not is hardly a matter for
discussion in the pages of our very respectable Magazine ! Certainly
they have the most lovely eyes ! By a strange anomaly the country
boasts of one of the most beautiful of Parrots of the genus Amazona,
and the most striking feature of this bird is its lovely eyes. They
are very large for the size of the Parrot, and are surrounded by a ring
of pure white skin and set off by black eyelashes which gives the bird
a very soft and gentle expression. In fact, I think that the eyes of
A. autumnalis are quite unique.
When landing in a strange port I used to make a search for rare
Parrots, and the&amp;apos;way I usually found them was by asking someone
if they knew of anyone who had a Parrot for sale, and when I found
that it was an ordinary one I would say that it wasn't the sort I wanted,
did they know of anyone else who had one, and so on ad lib. ; and in
time I usually found something worth having ! In this way I bought

my bird from a Spanish lady whom I persuaded to part with it. She
was not anxious to part with her treasure and demanded a high price
for it, but I was so struck by the beauty of the bird that I soon con-
cluded the bargain and carried my treasure away on my shoulder.
This Parrot was living quite at liberty in the courtyard of the house
and was in the most wonderful condition. Little or nothing seems
to be known of the habits of the Yellow-cheeked Parrot, which is not
to be wondered at, for the interior of Costa Rica is almost impenetrable ;
luxuriant forest covers the whole of this very mountainous country.
Only two roads run for 5 miles on each side of Port Limon, the chief
port of the country.
Although my bird was very tame it was never familiar like the other
Parrots : it always had a superior air about it, but did not object to
being picked up though refusing to be petted. I seldom have heard it
use its natural voice, but when outside it will imitate a brood of
young puppies. Sometimes it wanders away, and is extremely
difficult to find when hidden in a bush.
It is heavier than any other " Amazon " Parrot I have ever handled,
but once it seemed to go out of condition and got very much lighter and
during this time the brilliant crimson frontal band faded very much ;
but after a few weeks the bird recovered and got back to its normal
weight and the red assumed its normal tint again. Though rather
reserved the bird is not at all lacking in intellect; it has very little
to do with the other Parrots in the same aviary, but will savagely
resent any attack made on it by another bird. I consider this to be
the most beautiful of the " Amazon " Parrots.
The Vinaceous Parrot (Amazona vinacea) is a very pretty
little Parrot which seems to have been imported more frequently
than in former years, but even now it is fairly rare and commands
a rather high price in the English market. It differs from all
the other " Amazons " in having the breast coloured somewhat like
a washed-out Imperial Parrot's, the feathers of the hind neck are
lengthened, and as in the latter bird form a kind of hood which can
be raised at will. There is something about this bird which reminds
me of a Pigeon : perhaps it is the small head.
Unlike the other Parrots mentioned above, all of which are rare in

the wild state, this one seems to be quite common in its native haunts,
which are given as South-Eastern Brazil, Paraguay, and the Northern
Argentine, so it is surprising that it is so rare over here.
A quiet, gentle creature, my bird seems to have no vices, delights
in being spoken to and taken notice of, it whistles but seems to make
no other noises. It is the gentlest of my Parrots and never resents
the attacks of the other birds. I should think that if one could devote
time to it and keep it in the house it would become a delightful pet,
but I never keep any of my Parrots in cages, for I think it is cruelty,
so on that account never bring any into the house.
Other writers who have possessed this bird also state that it has
a charming character.

It is six months since I last sent you a few notes on the birds in
my aviary, Mr. Editor. So while sitting in the shelter watching my
little friends feed within a few feet of me, this fine sunny November
morning, I thought you would perhaps like to hear what had happened
in the intervening time.
In the first instance, many thanks to Lord Tavistock for putting
me on to the Therm X heaters as a method of warming an aviary.
I find they are rather expensive to run with Aviation Spirit at 2s. 2 d.
a gallon and they have only two speeds, full on and dead slow--in
other words they cannot be regulated. In every other respect they
are excellent, clean, no fumes, no smell, no danger from fire or explosion,
and fool-proof. For a small aviary about 1,000 cubic feet of space,
they are most useful. One gallon of spirit lasts forty-five hours and
keeps the inside temperature eight or ten degrees above the outside.
So what I do is use the oil lamp in the day when I am about, and the
Therm X at night when the aviary has to be left to itself. The lighting-
up, a simple matter, is done about sunset when the birds are going
to roost; they take little notice of my movements if not left too late,
but do not like being disturbed in that half light just before dark,
and yet when quite dark I can go in with my electric lamp and there is

not a movement so long as one goes about quietly. It's singular how
many people wish to see my birds just at this most critical time,
particularly in the summer months. I suppose its the time of day
most people wander round their gardens, and a very pleasant time too,
on a fine warm evening such as we have had quite a number of this
year. So I have to say, " Sorry, but the children are going to bed,
come and have a look about noon on Sunday, then you will see them at
their best." The bird lover with the aviary sense will understand
what I mean, the other will say, " What the-is the man talking
about ? " So much for lamps and bedtime.
Well, Sir, due to the excellent weather we have had this last six
months, my birds have kept in splendid condition, the aviary popula-
tion increasing by about 25 per cent, unfortunately, like other popula-
tions, at that end of the scale least desired. However, it is most
encouraging after fighting uphill for many years, and goes to prove
that most of my troubles have been climatic. The Pekin Robins
(Leiothrix) mentioned in my last notes were not successful in rearing
any young again this year. The cock built four nests but the hen
would have nothing to do with three of them and only laid one egg
in one nest and never attempted to sit. So the kind suggestions of
Mr. Sich and Mr. Arthur Lewis re ant-eggs and gentles, though of use
in the case of other birds, were not employed for the benefit of the
Pekin Robins.
Zebra Finches, Fire Finches and Grey Singing Finches have all
done well. Zebras are now as prolific as Canaries ; a little fresh blood
added this year produced fine healthy stock. They build their untidy
nests everywhere, but I notice that those nests inside the shelter
are most successful in rearing young. They are a quarrelsome crowd
among themselves, but do one another no harm and are very tame.
Fire Finches seem to prefer cocoanut husks for nesting sites, outside in
full sun, the cocks being great policemen when the hens are sitting,
no one dare so much as look at a nest, even Javas are sent dying
if too near. I have read with interest Mr. Godfrey Davis' article on
Melanism in Ornamental Finches. Has not light as much to do with
colour as water ? I notice my Fire Finches (Lagonosticta senegola) are
much brighter crimson about Christmas than in June. This may

be clue to moult, but may not light have something to do with it ?
The sun's rays being (in this hemisphere) more actinic in spring and
summer than in autumn and winter, producing greater black pigmenta-
tion. It is certainly interesting to hear of Avadavats changing from
crimson to brick-red and back again to crimson in a few days. The
change of colour in birds is a most interesting study. I have a cock
Indigo Bunting just now in what may be termed his eclipse plumage.
He moulted his fine blue coat in July-August, and now looks like a
Sparrow with a few feathers tipped with blue. In January he will
gradually evolve a blue coat--I can use no other word for he does
not cast a feather, they simply become blue. The change is as
marvellous as that of a Mallard drake. Now the Orange Bishop
seems to grow his new orange and black and cast it in January, as
also does the Paradise Whydah. Grey Singing Finches, the most
charming singers next to a Lark in my opinion, are hardy little birds
and make a small neat nest like a Chaffinch in the thickest bush they
can find outside. They and the Siskins all roost together in a small
flock of eight on the highest and most exposed tree outside, winter and
summer alike, consequently they get frights on moonlight nights
and knock the feathers off their heads against the wire ; at least some
of them do, the older ones seem to have learned a thing or two.
Last spring I lost seven birds from causes I could not fathom,
serious injuries to the head, in all cases they were birds in poor con-
dition. I suspected cats, rats, Owls and everyone but the real culprit,
a sly gentleman, to wit, a cock Cardinal. I ought to have suspected
his Jay-like majesty sooner, but even now the evidence against him
is purely circumstantial. I have never seen him attack any bird.
However, suspecting his sly manners, I removed him, since when
there have been no more deaths by injuries.
This move was really unfortunate, for the hen was sitting at the
time. I hoped she would continue, for she was well on her way,
over a week, but no, she gave up because the cock was not there to
feed her : her three eggs were hard set. Of course I knew I was taking
a risk. It is a pity, but the Cardinal is too large company for my
small birds, and at present I have no accommodation for large birds
by themselves so they will have to go. I won't keep him in a small

cage. The cock is a beautiful whistler, a mixture of Blackbird and
Nightingale, and it is only in the breeding season this proclivity to
assault other defenceless birds persists. The hen has been along with
the other birds all the time, and is a quiet shy bird, quite inoffensive.
The cock is now getting through his moult and being fed up and treated
with Parish's Food. The hen got through her moult in August and
September and is in perfect condition now. A cock Nonpareil Bunting,
also in the moult and nearly featherless, is undergoing generous diet
and Parish's, under cover. Last year he moulted outdoors, but he is
so naked this year I feared pneumonia, so am keeping him up until
he is through. A cock Rainbow Bunting, having gone through similar
treatment when he was moulting six or seven weeks ago, is now in
perfect plumage. The generous diet includes a few mealworms for
those who will take them. I have caught up all my Gouldian, Long-
tailed and Masked Grass Finches (ten) for the winter. I always
regret having to do so because they are all in breeding condition,
but to leave them outdoors in this northerly winter were folly. To
keep and breed this class of semi-tropical Southern Hemisphere bird
up here one should have at least two-thirds more indoor space than
outdoor. In fact I think we all make the mistake of not providing
more indoor accommodation than outdoor. Of course, it is more
expensive, but I feel sure that with the facilities for using the sun-rav
electric lights and other contrivances these particular birds would
breed well even in the gloomy northern winter. As it is, they are in
pairs, in roomy cages with nesting boxes and materials of which one
pair of Gouldians and one pair of Long-tails have made use, and I am
living in hopes. And yet, having written the above remarks about
North Australian Finches, I wonder why they should not be quite as
hardy as the Zebra Finch or St. Helena Waxbill, much smaller birds
and both of which have full liberty of both shelter and flight all the
year round. The latter built nests, very like our Willow Warbler,
on the ground in long grass, but as I have more cocks than hens nothing
came of the effort. Well, I may experiment with a pair of one or the
other Australian Finches after this winter, as I hope to correct my

certainly ought to do our utmost for our beautiful and entertaining
little proteges.

By D. Seth-Smith
The genus Turnix comprises a group of small Quail-like birds
which in structure and habits are very distinct from the true Quails,
or in fact to the true gallinaceous birds. They possess only three
toes, the hind one being absent. The female is not only larger but,
in most species, more brightly coloured than the male. Their breeding
habits are peculiar in that the female courts and, if necessary, defends
the male, and it is the inconspicuously coloured male that undertakes
the duty of incubating the eggs and rearing the young. When the
male commences to sit the female leaves him and re-commences her
booming call by which she hopes to attract another male.
The nest is formed in a slight depression in the ground, lined with
grass and often covered by a domed structure of grass. Three or
four eggs go to a clutch and the incubation period is no more than
twelve to fourteen days. The eggs are of much the same appearance
in all of the species, the ground colour being whitish or buff with two
distinct sets of spots or blotches, generally an underlying one of pale
lilac or brown, with more distinct spots of brown on the surface. The
young are covered with down, beautifully marked, and are able to
follow their parent in a few hours.
The Bustard or Button Quails inhabit most of the tropical and
sub-tropical countries of the Old World, being found mostly in dry
and somewhat barren country where clumps of grass and low bushes
grow amongst rocks and sand. They subsist upon small seeds and
insects, and in captivity will thrive in a moderately warm and dry
aviary ; and some three or four species have bred in captivity.
The Andalusian Bustard Quail (Turnix sylvalica) occurs in
North Africa and in Southern Europe. The female is about 7 inches
in length, the male an inch less. The centre of the breast is russet-red,
the sides being pale buff, and, in the female, the nape is dull red.
The Black-breasted Bustard Quail (T. pugnax) occurs in India,
Ceylon, the Malay States and China. The female is some 6J inches
in length, the male fully an inch less. In the female the throat and
often the middle of the breast are black, that of the male being white.
The upper surface is brown, mottled with black.

The Lepurana Bustard Quail (T. lepurana) appears to be a small
race of the Andalusian Bustard Quail occurring chiefly in the southern
half of Africa. It has been bred in England by Mr. H. L. Sich.
The Little Bustard Quail (T. dussumieri) has been frequently
imported from India. The female is some 5 inches in length, the male
being somewhat smaller. The general colour is huffish straw-colour,
the sides of the breast being spotted with black and rufous. The male
is less brightly coloured than the female.
The Little African Bustard Quail (T. nana) is distinguished
from the preceding by having the sides of the breast barred. It is
occasionally imported from Southern Africa.
The Larger Indian Bustard Quail ( T . tanki) is a very handsome
species though rarely imported. The adult female is grey on the back,
rufous on the chest and underparts, and during the breeding season has
a bright reddish collar on the nape. The male is smaller, brown on
the back, and without the nuchal collar. It becomes extremely tame
in captivity, and a full account of its breeding by the present writer
appeared, with a coloured plate of both sexes in the Avicultural
Magazine of August, 1903.
The Varied Bustard Quail (T. varia ) is a very handsome bird,
inhabiting Australia, the female being fully 7J inches in length, while
the male is quite an inch less. The back is black barred with rufous,
and the female has a conspicuous reddish chestnut collar on her nape
which is wanting in the male. The species is unfortunately very
seldom imported, which is to be regretted, as it is a charming bird in
captivity and there is no difficulty in breeding it in a suitable aviary.
For a full account of its very interesting and curious breeding habits
I would refer the reader to the Avicultural Magazine of August, 1905.
The Swift Bustard Quail (T. velox). A small rufous-coloured
bird, belonging to a small group of this genus possessing very stout
bills. It inhabits Australia and has been imported on rare occasions.
A pair owned by the present writer showed no inclination to breed.
The sexes are similar in colour and markings, the female being slightly
larger than the male.
The Bufous-chested Bustard Quail (T. pyrrhothorax) is like
the last in possessing a very stout bill. Its general colour above is

stone grey, the feathers being marked with narrow cross-bars of rufous
and black. The sides of the face and neck are white, tipped with
black, and the chest and flanks rufous. The female is about 6 inches
in length, the male an inch less.
This species occurs in the Eastern parts of Australia.
In addition to the above, T. maculosa of Australia and New Guinea
and T. nigricollis of Madagascar have been imported.
The Collared Plain Wanderer (Pedionomus torquatus) may be
said to be a Bustard Quail possessing a small hind toe, and peculiarly
soft plumage. It is found in the dry districts of the interior and
southern parts of Australia and has only been imported on very rare
occasions. The writer has only seen two living examples, both of
which were females.
The female is over 6 inches in length, the male being somewhat less.
The upper plumage is brown, finely barred with black, and the neck
of the female is surrounded by a collar of white-tipped black feathers,
followed by a further band of reddish buff on the nape and upper part
of the chest. The underparts are buff, barred with black, the chin
and throat being white. In the male the collar is much less conspicuous
and the reddish colour is lacking from the nape. This little bird has
much the appearance of a minute Rhea. It becomes very tame
and its habits appear to be similar to those of the true Bustard Quails.
There is little doubt that it would breed in captivity.

Since Records of Birds Bred in Captivity 1 appeared in 1926 quite
a large number of new records both for species and hybrids have
accumulated. A list of the more important of these should be of
interest. To save space merely the name and shortest possible note
is given here, though for most I have the full record, which may later
on be put to further use.

The October number of Aviculture, the journal of the Avicultural
Society of America, contains an interesting article, reprinted from
The Pan American , in which Mrs. A. H. Bryan, of Canal Zone, describes
the successful breeding in captivity of the Marble Guiana Quail,
Odontophorus guianensis panamensis, a species that is practically
unknown to aviculture. It appears to be a very desirable species
for aviculture and one that is ready to breed in spite of much mistaken
attention on the part of its owner.
The experiment of allowing Weaver-birds complete liberty in a
garden during the summer months as described by Mr. Maynard in
our December number, is an extremely interesting one and was a very
complete success owing to the fact that the birds were content to stay
in the neighbourhood of the cage, from which they had been liberated
and in which they were regularly fed.
There is a feeling amongst certain ornithologists that no species
should be liberated that is not indigenous in view of the numerous
mistakes, fraught with dire consequences, that have been made in
acclimatization in the past. But I have always held the view that
providing only species from a warm climate are introduced into a less
congenial one, where they cannot survive the colder season without
man's help in the matter of food and shelter, such introduction cannot
lead to harm, for the introduced birds are under complete control.
The latest number of the Bulletin of the New York Zoological Society
is a particularly interesting one, consisting as it does of a full account
of Mr. Lee S. Crandall's recent expedition to New Guinea in quest of
Paradise and other rare birds. From it one obtains a very good idea
of the difficulties and danger of these collecting trips to countries such as
New Guinea, where the comforts of civilization are unknown. On
the return trip between Port Moresby and Sydney the steamer ran on
to a coral reef where she stuck fast and was pounded by heavy seas,
the passengers and valuable collection of birds being transferred to
another vessel after five days. However, in spite of many difficulties,
the collection reached New York in excellent condition, with forty
Birds of Paradise of nine species and some 200 other birds.

Sir,- --There was some correspondence a short time ago as to the
usual length of life of small foreign birds in cages and aviaries. I have
just lost a hen Gouldian Finch which I bought in adult plumage in
February, 1924 ; she must, therefore, have been at least seven years
old when she died. She had two nests each year for five years in my
aviaries, and only in her last season failed to rear any youngsters.
I wonder what the natural length of life of a Gouldian is in the wild
state ?
I have several Waxbills living in one of my outside aviaries now
which must be " getting on " : a cock St. Helena, cock Fire Finch, an
Orange Cheek, and two Grey Waxbills all five years old or more, as
I bought them early in 1925. These have been outside without heat
ever since I had them and are only shut up in their shelter in the
severest weather ; they get plenty of greenfly, etc., in the summer,
and are always in perfect condition.
The oldest bird in my collection is a common Turtle Dove who is
twenty-three ! He or she is perfectly tame and answers to the name
of " Daisy She was hand-reared by an old lady patient of mine
who died last year and bequeathed her pet to me. For twenty-two
years she had lived in a small all-wire Canary cage, and when I first
had her she was hardly able to stand and could not use her wings.
Now in an indoor aviary, which she shares with a tame cock Pennant
who cannot fly, she is full of life and can fly well. She is the tamest
Dove I have seen, quite without fear of man, in fact she prefers our
company. She bullies the Pennant if he dares to come too near her.
C. H. Macklin.
Sir, -- I have just lost a Purple Sugar-bird that was given to me
by the late Mr. Hubert Astley some years ago. He bought a pair in
1912, and he told me they were then adult, so that it is impossible to
know really what age my bird was. The little hen died in 1922, and
the late Mr. P. F. Galloway, to whom I sent her, asking if he could tell

me the cause of death, assured me she was in perfect health and that
in his opinion had just died of " old age ". The little male bird was
an inveterate bather, so much so that to-day, seeing he was not quite
so brisk as usual, the bath was removed from the bird-room, but so
determined was he to have his usual " dip " that he bathed in the
drinking fountain and fell over dead. I suppose the cold water was
too much for the heart. This little bird must, to my knowledge,
have been seventeen years old, as he was adult in 1912 when my
brother-in-law bought him ; he can quite easily have been eighteen
years of age.
Surely this is a record for such a delicate specimen ?

Sir, --The old Foreign Bird Club used to have a Register of members
who bred certain kinds of foreign birds and who usually had some
youngsters for sale or exchange in the season. Would it not be useful
to publish such a list occasionally in the Avicultural Magazine ?
It appears that we shall have to rely more and more on aviary-bred
birds with all the export restrictions now in force, and one cannot keep
a small breeding stock going without exchanges for new blood at
intervals.
At the present time I should like to exchange a young cock Cockatiel
for another and I have small breeding stocks of Black Cheek Lovebirds
Nyasa Lovebirds, Zebra Finches, Diamond Doves, and Cockatiels. To
keep these going I shall have to make exchanges during the coming
seasons.

members have ever tried the use of homoeopathic remedies. I may
remark I never use any other, first the medicines are perfectly tasteless,
easily administered in drinking water, and really very wonderful in
their effects.
The first time I used any was in the case of a nest of young Black-
birds, which I found badly affected with small worms. The season
was very wet and the old bird was evidently feeding on fruit, such as
raspberries.
The remedy I used was " Cince anthelmintica " (worm seed), 1 drop
of 3x potency in 1 teaspoonful water, given in 1 drop doses 3 times a day.
This is, of course, for birds being hand-reared.
The next and more wonderful medicine is for the prevention of
egg-binding. I used it in Scotland where I was trying to breed mules.
It is very cold there in the spring, and directly any birds were mated
up and looked like breeding I gave this medicine, 3 drops in drinking
water every day. It is named " Comicefuga racemosa " 3x potency.
I shall be glad to hear if any other members have tried these
medicines, and with what results and for what other illnesses.

Sir, --I thought the following extract from an account of an expedi-
tion to Cape York Peninsula, Australia, which appeared in the
Advertiser , Adelaide, might be of possible interest to readers of the
Magazine, for it records a fact which to me appears unique in the
annals of natural history.
" On the open plains towards the Holroyd River I had a glimpse
of a pair of the Golden-shouldered Parrots, probably one of the rarest
and loveliest Parrots in the world. To search for this species Mr. W.
McLennan conducted an expedition to Cape York in 1922 for the late
Mr. H. L. White. McLennan not only succeeded in confirming the
original identification of this Parrot made by Gould in 1857, but
obtained one of the most remarkable stories of bird life that has yet
been unfolded. Locally the Golden-shouldered Parrot is known as
the " Ant-hill " Parrot because it breeds in a chamber excavated at
the end of a tunnel in an ant-hill.

" McLennan found that after the eggs were hatched the larvse of a
moth--found to be quite new to science and described by the appalling
name of Neossiosynoeca scatophaga --took up their abode in the loose
porous floor of the cavity. The extraordinary thing about these larvse
was that they acted as scavengers in the nest, living upon the faeces
of the birds."
This is surely one of the most extraordinary provisions of nature
in regard to " household hygiene " !

Sir, --The following interesting items have been extracted from
recent numbers of Aviculture , the monthly magazine of the Avicultural
Society of America :--
Dr. Leon Patrick, of Orange, California, has obtained a cross between
a Stanley (Platycercus icterotis) and a Pileated Parrakeet ( Porpurei-
cephalus spurius). The Pileated--one of last year's home-bred birds--
was put in an aviary with the Stanley, merely as odd birds and with
no intention of breeding from them. Four eggs were duly laid, one
of which eventually proved to be clear, one contained a well-developed
embryo, and the other two produced two youngsters which are doing
well.
Two young Roseate Cockatoos were hatched in the aviaries of
Mr. Francis H. Rudkin. They were left with their parents until some
six weeks old, when they were removed from the nest by Mrs. Flowers,
of the Tropical Bird Farm, so as to rear them quite tame.
The authorities of the San Diego Zoological Park have turned their
attention to breeding Parrots. The conditions are not all that could
be desired for this purpose, but Swainson's Lorikeets, Cockatiels,
Quakers and Bengal Ringnecks have been reared. A pair of Eclectus
Parrots (species not stated) caused much disappointment on account
of unsuccessful nesting attempts. Two clutches of eggs were hatched.
The first couple of youngsters died almost immediately, but the second

couple lived for several weeks. They were deserted by their parents,
probably on account of the excessive heat prevailing at the time,
and because they were anxious to nest a third time. Improper feeding
would appear to have contributed to their early demise, as the following
extract from the report will show :--
" Much thought and time was given to the question of feeding ;
quite by accident, it was discovered that other Parrots which had access
to meat were eating heavily of it during this same period, while they
refused it at other times. Reasoning that perhaps during nesting
period the Parrots fed partly upon the young of other birds, it was
determined to give them a limited quantity of lean meat, such as the
heart muscles and choice bits of the forage meat. The Eclectus ate
all of the meat given to them and certainly took the best care of the
young ones."
From the above it may be gathered that the feeding methods
employed at San Diego differ somewhat from those familiar to avi-
culturists in England. The theory that certain species of Parrots
partly feed their young on the young of other birds would also appear
to be new.
Mr. Ansel W. Robinson, of San Francisco, has received recently
several Kuhl's Ruffed Lories (Vini Jcuhli). This miniature Lory has
apparently only been imported into England once, and that some
fifty years ago.

Sir, --In February, 1928, I bred hybrid between Black-cheeked
and Masked Lovebirds, and was awarded the silver medal of the
Societe d'Acclimalation de France. All through the past tropical
summer I have tried to induce these hybrids to breed and failed,
but now that the inclement season is with us I have two pairs nesting
and sitting upon eggs.
I am extremely doubtful whether any results will materialize.
As in the original parents, the hen bird is larger than the male. These
hens showed every sign of wanting to pair and nest. The cock birds
appeared anxious too, but their actual mating did not appear so satis-

The climate does not seem to affect them at all (they were hatched
when deep snow lay on the ground) and they have nested outside in
nest-boxes hung upon the wires of the aviary. Nest-boxes hung up
inside the covered portion they treat with disdain. They make a
large nest of hay, straw, and twigs, and fill the nest-box nearly to the
brim. They are sitting strongly, and can be inspected by any member
of our Society who may be passing and cares to see them.

Sir, --In July, 1927, a letter from Mr. M. T. Allen appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine warning breeders against the use of aluminium
rings for young Lovebirds. He stated that the rings work up the
tibia, and swelling and gangrene rapidly set in.
I wonder if any of our other members have had any experience
in the use of these rings for Lovebirds, as, in view of the warning,
I have always refrained from ringing my young Lovebirds, but now
find it almost a necessity as I am building up a breeding stock of these
birds. I do not think celluloid rings would be strong enough for
Lovebirds.
Fischers, Masked, and Black-cheeks have all laid here during the
first week of December, and I have at present some young Masked
which I should be pleased to exchange with other members for a change
of blood.

<bodyText confidence="0.998222892857143" page_id="56211445"  page_num="28" year="" vol="">
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 24 inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

<bodyText confidence="0.955535066666667" page_id="56211454"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The Touracos of the genus Schizorhis, or Corythaixoides, of which
there are some five or six species, differ greatly in appearance from
those contained in the other genera of the Family Musophagidae. They
are dull-coloured birds, grey or greyish-brown, whereas the others are
brightly coloured, green, blue, and carmine-red prevailing.
The White-bellied Touraco (Schizorhis leucogaster) inhabits the
forests of East Africa, feeding upon various fruits and also to a great
extent upon leaves and shoots, while it also probably takes insects
to a small extent. It is not often imported and is generally regarded
as difficult to keep and somewhat uninteresting in captivity. A pair
owned by Mr. Whitley, however, have done extremely well and, seen
in an outdoor aviary, give the impression of being handsome, lively,
and attractive birds. It is from these that our coloured plate has
been drawn.

The mystery of the nesting habits of the little King-bird, Cicinnurus
regius, is by way of being solved. Last winter I managed to segregate
some half-dozen pairs ? and toward the latter end of March a nest con-
taining two eggs was discovered in a hole in a small tree, about seven
feet up. Owing to the extreme wariness of the hen, I was never able

W. J. G. Frost --
to obtain a snapshot of her entering or leaving, and even at the last
moment when collecting the eggs one evening, she managed to slip
through my fingers. The cock-bird, however, was always more or
less in evidence, cursing and swearing and generally trying to bluff
any intruders.
The nest hole was small, about 1J in. diameter, and approximately
18 inches deep, but filled to within a few inches of the lip with palm
fibre. The eggs, two in number, measuring 27*50 X 21 mm., were
of a creamy white, flushed with pink, typically marked and curiously
resembling, except for size, those of Paradisea apoda.
Enclosed herewith a couple of photos, which may be of interest
for the Avicultural Magazine.
Owing to the extreme scepticism with which my earlier suggestions
(that some of the Paradisidse might quite possibly be hole-builders)
had been received, and the fact that I was not actually able to take
the female with the clutch, I put the matter aside, pending further
corroboration.
No further nests were found in that reserve, however. Possibly
the other " hens " were really immature males, or too young, or still
too unsettled in their necessarily more confined quarters, or, even
more likely still, a lack of really suitable nesting sites. However,
taking a hint from the situation of the nest already found, on my return
here to Sourabaia, we at once provided a captive pair (deposited in
the Zoo here some two years ago) with a vertical nesting log (inside
measurements 5 inches dia., 6 inches depth from hole). These birds
had, in company with a pair each of Wilson's ( Schlegelia ) and Magnifi-
cents ( Diphyllodes ), and a few odd Pittas, the run of an open aviary
about 12 feet square, planted with palm, lantana, and various small
shrubs. No attempt at nesting or even mating had up to then been
noticed, although the various cocks danced frequently. Unfortunately
I was obliged to leave Java again for some months, and with the
usual scepticism, during my absence no particular observation on the
nesting log was kept. Even when a few weeks later the hen regius
was reported missing, it was merely entered up as escaped or taken
by rats.

The Nesting Habits of the King Bird of Paradise 35
About a month later, however, she suddenly turned up again,
and only then was a thorough investigation made, resulting in the
discovery of two dead youngsters in the log, apparently about one
week old, but badly damaged by ants.
On this, it was decided to give the pair another chance, and a
larger aviary, with more accommodation in the matter of shrubs,
a clump of dwarf bamboo, and a small flat-topped Acacia tree, was
allotted to their sole use. The same nest log was also included and
hung in the fork of the tree at a height of about 7 feet. They were
some considerable time in settling down, but eventually in early
September, the hen went to nest again, using the same log, in preference
to all the " spacious and desirable building sites " we had been at such
pains to arrange for her.
This time she laid but one egg, and never " sat ", climatic conditions
possibly, September being at the height of the dry season, and the
male being in full moult, may have made a difference.
However, the interesting point to me is naturally the definite
corroboration by both egg and the choice of nesting site of the
authenticity of the clutch taken in the Aru Islands last March. I
am hoping by the New Year to be in New Guinea again, when with
luck I may be able to collect still more data from the pairs put up last
winter.
Of Wilson's and Magnificents I am still without hens ; it is curious
how very, very seldom one runs across the females of any of the
Paradisidse.
Pairs of Uranornis rubra and Seleucides ignotus have been playing
at nest building all the year, but with no results. The Rubras are
especially tantalizing. I think the cock has tried every possible site,
from an empty box to a scrape in the ground, including also a dense
bamboo clump and the heart of a tree fern, only sooner or later to have
the materials ruthlessly scattered by his termagant little mate. I
must get another pair, and try what swapping partners will do next
season.

This beautiful Parrot is much rarer than it is generally thought;
in fact, I believe that it will be exterminated before its near relative
A. imperialis is, for the fact is that while the Imperial Parrot keeps to
the most inaccessible parts of the mountain forests of Dominica, this
bird at certain seasons of the year comes down into the open country--
in fact, right down to the sea coast--in search of certain fruits, and is
consequently much better known than the other bird, and this would
give the stranger the impression that it is the commoner of the two.
It is certainly easier to capture or, rather, shoot, but in a few years
I am sure that it will pass away for ever.
I was exceedingly lucky in getting a true pair of these Parrots as
soon as I landed at Portsmouth, a tiny native settlement where I
arrived on my way from Roseau to the country of the Imperial Parrot.
Asking the driver, who was taking me to the other side of the island,
if he had ever heard of the " Ciceroo " (A. imperialis) and if it were
possible to see these birds in their native haunts or even secure one,
he shook his head and said that it was almost impossible either to see
or to get one alive, but he thought if I would like one to eat he might
be able to get a native to secure a dead one from the forests in the
interior ! On the other hand, if I wanted to buy a true pair of the other
native Parrots, he had a pair for sale which he had had for twelve
months, and which he was hoping to take one day to Koseau for sale.
Needless to say that with no arguing the bargain was clinched, but
afterwards he said, much to my disgust, that he had to shoot thirty
of these birds before he wounded these two so slightly that they lived.
I suppose he was trying to justify what he thought a high price, but
the tragedy of it! The natives know that these birds fetch a nominal
price in Koseau (the capital), where the residents know no difference
between them and the other South American Parrots which are often
brought to the island, so they go on killing them in large numbers
so that by chance they may wound one or two slightly, which they sell.
Of course, the dead ones are eaten, I have even heard of twelve a day

being killed by white residents who were fond of eating Parrot-pie.
So the crime of exterminating this species does not lie wholly with the
black man. In the season when the birds come down from the
mountains numbers are exposed for sale in the little settlement of
Portsmouth, where, I believe, they are sold for the sum of Is. each.
No law or restrictions can stop this, for very few white people live
in the part of the island where these birds are found, and nothing will
apparently stop the indiscriminate killing until the birds have been
exterminated. It is one of the saddest things in the life of a keen
ornithologist to stand by helpless and see such a beautiful species as
this swept into oblivion.
What can be done ? The natives know no better, sometimes when
the hurricanes devastate their crops and they are nearly brought to
starvation, they shoot the birds either for food or to gain a little by
selling them in the town. I certainly think that twenty years or so will
see the end of this very interesting species, and A. bouqueti will be,
except for a few dried skins, but a memory of the past, mourned for by
a few sentimental naturalists like myself, who would rather think of
the birds in their native woods than lying in the cabinets of museums.
People on the island will tell you that the bird is still common and
easy to procure, and that certain people have one for sale, but invariably
one finds that the birds which are on sale are those from South
America, usually Yellow-fronted and Orange-winged Amazons. There
were very few of the native Parrots in captivity on the island besides
the ones which I secured ; I knew of three others (but no doubt there
were others), one belonging to a gentleman in Roseau who never went
anywhere without it on his shoulder ; another belonging to an English
lady, who lived in the interior of the island ; and one belonging to a
native storekeeper, who refused to sell it because his wife was so fond
of it; but one day he turned up with the bird in a small basket and
offered it to me for five dollars, whether he was hard up or had quarrelled
with his wife I never knew, but I was very glad to get the bird, as it
was exceedingly tame, and proved to be a bird of great character.
The only thing that would save this species from extermination
would be to capture a fair number (and even then a hundred might
be killed in the capturing of ten, for the natives know of no way to

procure these birds except by shooting them), and release them on
some small uninhabited island, such as Little Tobago, where still live
a colony of Birds of Paradise taken there about twenty years ago by
Sir William Ingram, and which is owned by an American naturalist.
It would be a good work if some wealthy naturalist would collect
specimens of the rare and rapidly decreasing West Indian Parrots and
release them on such a small island as mentioned, of which there are
dozens in the Lesser Antillean group, and maintain them under strict
supervision.
I feel sure that many of the other islands, such as Guadeloupe,
Martinque, Barbados, 1 etc., had Parrots which have long since been
exterminated (I believe that Martinque had a Parrot, but the terrible
eruption of Mont Pelee finished off the few specimens which had still
lingered on), owing to the easy access of their haunts. St. Vincent and
St. Lucia, which are similar to Dominica in being extremely
mountainous, still retain in very small numbers their indigenous
Parrots because of the inaccessibility of their haunts ; for why should
these islands have them and the others which lie in between have none ?
I think that they did, but in the early days of slavery, massacre, and
terror, which occurred in nearly all the islands, the birds were killed
and eaten for food, which still happens to-day to the birds in the other
islands. The Imperial and Guilding's Parrots are both still served up
" a la mode 55 at the native tables in Dominica and St. Vincent. What
a lot man has to answer for !
When my birds arrived from the village, about 10 miles away, I
was surprised at their size, for they are very much larger than most of
the other Parrots of the genus Amazona, and also at the exquisite
violet-blue of the head, face, and throat, which looks in skins and captive
birds a dull powder-blue. The hen had the whole of the upper breast
1 In an old and exceedingly rare book, The Natural History of Barbados, by
the Rev. Griffith Hughes, a ' ' Parakite " is mentioned : " This is of the frugivorous
kind, about the Bignefs of a Thrusfh, having a longer and more crooked bill.
It feeds upon almolt all manner of Berries, Popaws, and ripe Plantain, refiding
chiefly in inaccefQble Gullies.
The bird borrows its name from its refemblance in Make, but not in Plumage to
the small green Parakite."
Yet there is no trace whatever of this bird on the island now, no single person
to whom I spoke had ever heard of it.

a bright red colour. This was surprising, too, for in the skins this part
is usually yellow, or has a few scattered red feathers. I rather think
that this is a question of age, for I afterwards saw birds which had
neither red nor yellow upon the breast, and others which had but a few
feathers of either colour ; while, on the other hand, some had the whole
of the upper breast either red or yellow.
The male had one or two reddish feathers on the breast, he was a
much larger bird than his mate, and was, in fact, nearly as large as a
small male Imperial Parrot, which is smaller than the female. The tail
was also much longer than in the female, in fact, I think that this
species possesses a longer tail than any other of the birds of the genus.
I soon had my joy turned to sorrow, for only two days after I
received the birds I was playing about with them, thinking they were
much tamer than they really were, when suddenly the male took
flight, and although he had one wing partly clipped, flew into a large
lime tree.
Thinking that we might capture him, I sent a youngster up the
tree, but just as he was about to grasp the bird it flew into a higher
tree ; we kept watch until it was practically dark, and then another
fellow went up hoping that he might be able to secure it, but it took
fright and sailed off down the mountain side. We heard him call for
the next day or two, but he eventually disappeared. I only hope that
he was able to reach the forests, where the rest of the species lived.
This was very disappointing, especially after congratulating myself
upon securing a true pair of these very rare birds.
I made every endeavour to secure another male. Substantial
rewards were of no avail, but some time afterwards the other bird
mentioned turned up, an event for which I was truly thankful.
Sometime shortly before I left the island I met a native hunter
with two of the birds terribly wounded--at least, they appeared to be.
They were tied up with rope, many yards being wound round each
bird, until they resembled blood-stained packages of feathers ; poor
things they must have suffered agony. I asked the man what he was
going to do with them, and he informed me that if I didn't purchase
them he was going to eat them, so after telling him about his misdeeds,
which didn't seem to have much effect on him, I bought them.

We doctored the birds up, cleaned their wounds, etc., and they
turned out to be a couple of hens, one a young bird, and the other
turned out to be a very fine specimen. They quickly recovered, thanks,
no doubt, to their good constitutions, and soon got tame, though the
two birds which I already possessed never had anything to do with
them.
The greatest trouble was to get the birds off the sugar-cane diet,
for, apart from being a poor and insufficient food, it would be impossible
to procure it after leaving the island. I starved the birds (for which
I felt a brute), but it was of no avail. We tried all manner of things --
sweet potatoes, yams, bread and milk, all kinds of fruit, etc. ; but the
only thing they would touch was the seeds of one of the huge forest
palms, which the natives secured by cutting down one of the trees.
The seeds were very much like dari, and these the birds relished, which
was only natural, as it forms their chief food during certain seasons of
the year, when I am told dozens can be seen on one single spray. One
meets with these Parrots right in the heart of the great and magnificent
mountain forests, feeding upon the fruits of certain trees, and very
beautiful they look as they wheel overhead in the sunshine, much more
beautiful than A. imperialis, which looks very dark when silhouetted
against the sky.
They are apparently never seen in flocks of any size, but in ones and
twos, but as I was only there during the breeding season, that is no
criterion. I believe that they do go about in flocks in some seasons, for
a gentleman who lives in the interior of the island told me that he could
trace the passage of a small flock of these birds from hill to hill by
the reports from the rifles of the native gunners as they followed the
birds from one part to another.
The birds are extremely shy and wary, no doubt owing to the
constant persecution, but their presence is made known by their loud
chattering cries.
I hardly felt justified in bringing my four birds away with me, for
the race is rapidly approaching extermination, but I couldn't have
released them for their wings were clipped, and if I hadn't purchased
them no doubt they would have been sold to some coloured or Indian
person, who would have kept them in a cage suitable for a Canary,

and fed them upon bread soaked in water until in a few months their
unhappy career would have ended.
The birds were kept in an outhouse, the window being covered
with wire-netting, but they were put into the garden every day, where
they loved to grub about in the grass, eating various seed-pods. The
first two birds did not get on very well when the others were there.
If the hen tried to take any food away from her first mate he would
let her have it, but these two birds had savage tugs-of-war, which
usually ended in one of them taking hold of the other's head in its claws.
Though I questioned very many natives and also white people,
and went up myself into the great forests at the breeding season, I
never got to know anything of the breeding habits of these birds, but
no doubt they differ very little from those of the other Parrots of the
genus Amazona.
The very tame male which I got from the native storekeeper showed
a great interest in the Imperial Parrot which I had, and if I had occasion
to touch it (the Imperial), it would give vent to agonizing shrieks.
This would bring the bouqueti on the scene, and he would attack me
quite savagely, but he took no notice of the two wounded hens.
The man from whom I obtained the first pair of birds said that some
months ago a Yellow Parrot was seen (a Lutino), which was shot and
eaten !
The first two birds grew devoted to each other, and refused to have
anything to do with the two hens, even in close confinement, on the
way home.
At Barbados I took on board about a hundredweight of sugar-cane,
and after sealing the ends with tar it was put into cold storage, but
fortunately soon after we set sail they began to eat soft fruits, such as
pears, bananas, etc., which were smuggled out of the dining saloon ;
but it was only after they had been in captivity in this country for
some time that they commenced to eat hard seed.
This Parrot is not even protected in Dominica, though a Parrakeet
which does not exist is protected ! I saw the Commissioner of Police
and also the Administrator, and they both promised to get this matter
amended as soon as possible, and also issue warning to the natives in
regard to the shooting of the birds, but I regret to say that I am afraid

the police will have very little power in the remote parts where the
birds live.
In colour this bird is the usual grass-green of the genus, the whole
face, part of the crown, and the throat are a lovely pale violet, which
fades considerably when the birds have been in captivity for any
length of time. The males and some of the females have the upper
breast a bright rose-pink or dull red. Most of the young males and the
females lack this, though some have a few scattered feathers of red or
yellow on the chest.
The male is considerably larger than the female. One very fine
male which I possess has the whole of the breast a beautiful shade of
almond pink. This bird is extremely intelligent, and loves to be played
with. The head of this individual, strange to say, very closely resembles
that of its near relative A. versicolor.
The little hen referred to earlier in the chapter died shortly after
reaching these shores, and a post mortem revealed that a shot had
penetrated the lungs and caused pneumonia. I was very sorry to lose
her for she was such a quiet, charming, and pathetic little creature.
Another of my birds died, much to my regret; the cause of death was
a diseased spleen. How this came about I do not know, but despite
every care and attention, the bird just seemed to fade away. Much
to my surprise it proved to be a hen, for I had always regarded it as
a cock. It was very different in colour from any of the others,
being a deep emerald-green, with the upper breast a beautiful
rose-pink.
The older bird became after the moult a magnificent specimen,
nearly as large as a small Imperial. He was the most intelligent Parrot
I have ever had, differing in this respect from the others which have
been in captivity and whose owners have stated they have proved dull
and uninteresting pets.
When one enters the aviary he is always ready for a game. Hanging
from a slender branch by one foot, he will seize hold of one's nose, ear,
or hair, with the other foot and kiss one's lips. He loves to tease the
other Parrots, especially a large hen of his own species, but he is never
malicious, though sometimes when excited he will give an extra hard
nip. I have hopes that the birds may breed, but birds which have given

their hearts to their human captors are seldom much good for breeding
purposes, but at all events I hope that they will live for many years
and be a perpetual feast of beauty to the eyes of their owner.
I believe Bouquet's Parrot is the most delicate, in spite of its large
size, of all the Amazon Parrots, and needs to be kept in a high
temperature or it will soon go wrong. When the thermometer falls
below 70 degrees the birds appear dull and listless, but when it reaches
80 or over they soon regain their joie de vive.
For food they require an abundance of fresh ripe fruit, such as
pears, apples, grapes, etc. ; they are very fond of hawthorn-berries
and also elderberries ; I also give the ordinary Parrot mixture.
Many years ago the Rev. Canon Dutton possessed an example of
this bird, one of the few which have reached these shores besides the
two recently at the Zoo, and he said that he thought the bird was an
island species of the familiar Blue-front. The only conclusion I can
come to is that he had the wrong bird, for not only is A. houqueti half
as large again, but it is entirely different in colouring ; possibly he
may have got hold of a very young specimen.
I only hope that something will be done to preserve this beautiful
example of the large island species of the genus Amazona, for unless
something is done quickly it will join the ranks of the other West Indian
avifauna which have disappeared at the hand of man.
Before leaving Dominica I made a point of speaking to the warden
of the district, where A. imperialis and A. houqueti are found, and he
was anxious to do all possible for the better protection of these two
rare birds. He suggested that all guns held by natives should be called
in, but the commissioner of police said that this could not be done.
This latter gentleman said he would instruct the police in the district
to warn all the natives about shooting these birds.
When I came back to Roseau I saw the Administrator, who proved
to be a very charming gentleman. He was most anxious to get
information respecting the birds, and he promised to do his best to
stop further killing. Everyone was most anxious to protect this rare
and precious species, for if something is not done quickly the birds
are doomed to extinction, though a few may possibly linger for some
years in the deepest recesses of the mountain forests.

G. H. Gurney--Notes on the Past Season
I must say that during my search for these birds and the Imperial
Parrot I never met with such kindness and consideration from anyone
as I did from the white residents of the island with whom I came in
contact, especially from the lady and her brother who first induced me
to come to Dominica, and it was through them that I was so successful.
In conclusion I will quote a chapter from a very rare and quaint
book, Attwood's History of the Island of Dominica , respecting the
Parrots, and also the extinct Macaw Ara guadaloupensis, which will
explain how the one was exterminated and the others brought to the
verge of extinction :--
" The mackaw is of the parrot kind, but larger than the common
parrot and makes a difagreeable harfh noife. They are in great plenty
as are alfo parrots in thif ifland ; have both of them a delightful
green and yellow plumage, with fcarlet-coloured flefhy fubftance from
the ears to the root of the bill, of which colour is likewife the chief
feathers of their wings and tails.
" They breed on the tops of the higheft trees, where they feed on
the berries in great numbers together ; and are eafily difcovered by
their loud chattering noife, which at a diftance refembles human
voices. The mackaw cannot be taught to articulate words ; but the
parrots of this country may, by taking pains with them when caught
young. The flefh of both is eat but being very fat it waftes in roasting
and eats dry and inf fid ; for which reason they are chiefly ufed to make
fouf of ', which is accounted very nutritive

By G. H. Gurney, M.B.O.U.
In spite of the wonderfully hot, dry summer we had in Norfolk,
I do not think that the past breeding season was more favourable
to successes than summers when the weather was not nearly so good.
In some cases the great heat affected the birds adversely. A number of
common species nested and reared young, but by far the most interesting
occurrence here was the nesting of a pair of Buff "backed Herons ;

I have three of these most charming little Herons, and when I found
that two of them were anxious to nest, I removed the odd bird ; though
the aviary, which is a large one, still contained Glossy Ibises, Alpine
Choughs and numerous Waders. The nest was made in a large flat
basket fixed into the top of a small willow tree, three eggs were laid,
and both birds assisted in incubating them. At first I was very nervous
of the Choughs and possibly of the Ibises also, stealing the eggs, but
when I found what very good parents the Herons were, I risked leaving
the other birds, as it would have been rather difficult to have caught
them up in such a big place, without unduly frightening the Buff-backs.
These soon showed they were exemplary guards, and no other bird
was ever allowed anywhere near the nest; if one attempted to perch
near, it was at once driven off by the Heron which was not on the nest
at the time. Only two eggs hatched, the third was rotten, and I
was away from home at the time, but when I returned the young birds
were seven days old, most ungainly looking objects, still quite naked
except for various tufts of white down ; all seemed to be going well,
and the parents fed them assiduously on small pieces of fish, chopped-up
rat, and small frogs. Then one night the tragedy happened : after
a fine, hot day heavy clouds came up in the late afternoon, and that
evening we had a most tremendous thunderstorm, with an almost
tropical downpour of rain, which lasted for the greater part of the night.
In the morning I was horrified to find both the old birds off the nest
and two little drowned corpses lying side by side. The nest had no
protection at all, and the torrential rain must have been too much
for the old birds, who deserted the nest and left the young to their fate.
The only way one could have prevented such a disaster would have
been to have fixed some sort of shelter over the nest: but the storm
being at night made it impossible to do anything of this sort. The
Razor-bill Currassows again disappointed me by laying two unfertile
eggs, for the second year in succession. I have quite a little flock of
Helmeted Guinea-fowls, with the six or seven reared last year ; curiously
enough, the old birds showed no sign of going to nest again this year.
Several unfertile eggs were dropped by Demoiselle Cranes all over the
place, one on a gravel path, another in the middle of a paved court,
and two others in the centre of a flower-bed ; these were probably all

laid, I think, by the same bird ; of my six Demoiselles I fancy only
two are hens.
A cock Lilford's Crane mated to a hen Black-necked Crane, were
seen to pair, and a rough nest was made in a large patch of nettles,
and though both birds spent a great deal of time there nothing further
happened. A number of interesting birds have been added to the
collection during the summer ; some rare Hawks were acquired,
including a pair of Black-throated Buzzard Eagles (Busarellus nigricollis)
and a Harrier Eagle from South America, of whose species I am not yet
quite certain ; Mrs. Chapman sent me a very fine adult male King
Vulture, and a beautiful pair of nestling Montagu's Harriers, bred on
one of the Norfolk Broads, also reached me. My little Brown Milvago
is now in fully adult plumage, very dark brown, almost black above,
and creamy white below. I do not remember ever having seen one
in this plumage before, they are nearly always in the brown spotted
plumage. During a tremendous gale of wind here one night this
autumn one end of the Birds of Prey Aviaries was partly blown over,
and one of the larger Eagles managed to escape; it kept about the
place for several days, and looked magnificent making short soaring
flights, always returning to the trees near at hand. It refused to come
down to any food, though I do not think it caught any wild rabbits
or hares for itself ; but at the end of five days' liberty it must have been
getting very hungry. Finally it haunted the small pond in the garden,
and at first I feared for the safety of the pinioned Ducks there ; but
apparently it was very thirsty and sat on the edge of the water,
repeatedly putting its head down to try and drink ; owing to the drought
the water was very low, and the Eagle was unable to reach it. It
was comparatively tame, and allowed us to come to within 20 feet
before rising and sailing slowly into a tree ; the difficulty was how to
catch it. Finally, with a very long rod, with a line and sliding noose
on the end of it, we were able to drop it over the Eagle's head, a sharp
jerk, and the bird was dangling in the air, secured, and the noose
cut before it could strangle itself. It appeared to be none the worse
for its week's liberty.
San Bias Jays nested for the third year in succession, and as usual
ate their young when a few days old. This year I had completely

screened the aviary where these birds are, and they had the whole
place to themselves and unlimited mice and Sparrows to eat. I am
afraid they are inveterate cannibals. A pair of Spreo Starlings laid
four eggs, but refused to sit, so I placed the eggs in the nest of a Common
Starling, removing her own eggs, although these were almost due to
hatch. She did not appear to mind sitting another ten days longer,
and eventually hatched one young Spreo, the remaining three eggs
being rotten : this we took when it was on the point of flying and
reared by hand ; it is now a very fine, strong bird. A friend gave me
a pair of Common Mynahs : she brought them over early one morning,
and they were ar once liberated into an aviary with other birds. Within
an hour's time they had taken possession of a nesting-box, worked
feverishly all day building a nest, and by the following morning the
first egg was laid. Very quick work, all things considered. They
finally brought off two broods during the summer. A well-known
dealer sent me a fine pair of Tiger Bittens, of quite a different species
to the two I already have ; the latter are Tigrisoma lineatum, the new
ones being T . salmoni, a much rarer species, with the markings quite
different. The Tiger Bittens are always amongst the most popular
of my birds with visitors. The almost continual booming of the male,
with the extraordinary swaying motion of its head and neck, being
always a source of wonder and interest. The same dealer sent a
beautiful Heron too, with them ; it is Piterodius jpileatus, from South
America ; rather larger than a Squacco Heron, it is snow white, the top
of the head jet black, with two long white occipital plumes, the sides
of the face being sky-blue, a lovely combination of colour. Whether
the heat of last summer had anything to do with it or not, I don't
know, but the Scarlet Ibises are certainly much redder than they
were : one is almost like a wild bird and the other, which had become
a very pale pink, has regained its colour in a wonderful way. In
October Miss Chawner came down, bringing with her some of
Mr. Speedan Lewis' birds for me : a pair of Fairy Blue Birds, two
wonderful Pittas ( Pitta ellioti and P. granatina), some Boilers and
Grackles, and last but by no means least a magnificent pair of Sclaters'
Crowned Pigeons. Now we are busy erecting new aviaries, and taking
down some of the old ones which have been up for thirty years or more
and had become inconvenient and out of date.

By the Marquess of Tavistock
These notes are sent in response to a plea made in the Magazine
not long ago for more information about birds that are rare, or altogether
new to aviculture, whose history after arrival so often appears to go
wholly unrecorded. Some, no doubt, pass into the hands of those
black sheep of our Society who never give us the pleasure of reading
their discoveries and experiences ; while in other cases the birds may
die while we are waiting to acquire more knowledge of their habits,
and then, if we have prized them greatly, we may feel too sad and
disappointed to embark on an obituary notice !
The Sun Conure, although represented by one very old specimen
at the Zoological Gardens, has been almost unknown in the English
bird market ever since I began keeping Parrakeets. Three, however,
arrived a few months ago, two of which I secured for my collection.
They were in immature plumage, and had so much green about them
that I almost feared they were nothing but Jendayas ; a moult,
however, quickly vindicated the judgment of the dealer who first
identified them, and they have now assumed the lovely orange and
orange-red tints of the typical Solstitialis, together with profuse
yellow markings on the wings. It will be interesting to see whether
age brings a still further increase of the amount of yellow on the smaller
wing feathers. As soon as the birds arrived I turned them into a fairly
roomy square cage in the birdroom, and provided them with a sleeping-
box of which they took immediate possession. All the small Conures
need a box or log to roost in, and are uncomfortable and unhappy
without one, and liable to contract chills. I also, with great benefit
to their health and spirits, substituted a plain diet of Canary, white
millet, peanuts, and fruit for the sunflower seed on which they appeared
to have been brought over. It is a great pity that people will persist
in giving oily seeds to the South American Parrakeets. Both Conures
and Brotogerys are far better without them. Although the Sun
Conures are very friendly with each other and show a marked difference
in the size and shape of the head and beak, I am a little afraid that they
may not be a pair as the smaller one, who ought to be a hen, behaves

like a cock and is, indeed, quite saucy and impudent, puffing out his
feathers if I approach the cage and swaying about in a threatening
manner and making it plain that he would go for me if he could only
summon up a little more courage !
Like most of their race these Conures have horrible voices of which
they make such incessant and deafening use that I am at times obliged
to chase them into their dormitory so that I may watch the other
occupants of the birdroom in reasonable peace and quiet.
Very different to these noisy little monkeys are a pair of green
Broadbills from Mr. Goodfellow's latest collection. A portrait of a cock
bird in a recent number of the Magazine renders a description
unnecessary ; the hen is a much duller and rather paler green and
lacks the black bars across the wings. The Broadbills are housed in
a cage about 5 feet long with a perch at either end. They normally
occupy different perches and the hen seems a little afraid of her
companion, though I have never seen him attempt to molest her.
The food consists of banana, not too ripe, chopped into clean cubes
about the size of a finger-nail. Other fruit they do not so far touch,
but the hen, at any rate, ,is fond of mealworms. Although they do
not appear to have bathed, they have smartened up in appearance a
lot since their arrival, and look bright and well. When pleasantly
excited by the appearance of a dish of mealworms the hen utters a
liquid " Tooit, tooit " several times repeated, a call sometimes answered
by the cock in a higher key. The flight of the Broadbills, as far as
one can judge, is swift and direct, and they appear the most strictly
arboreal birds I have ever seen and quite incapable of using their
legs in any way for progress over a flat surface. If the cock, who
cannot fly very strongly owing to broken quills, is frightened off one
perch and misses the other, he does not attempt to run or hop but
flutters right on to the end of the cage and sits on his tail with his feet
against the wire until he can collect himself for a straight dash on to
the perch again. I greatly hope that these interesting birds will
survive until the summer as, in an outdoor aviary, I do not believe
they will prove in any way dull or lethargic.
The third pair of interesting new arrivals are a couple of Hanging
Parrots, apparently Worcester's Hanging Parrot from Samoa. They

very closely resemble the beautiful Golden-backed Hanging Parrot,
but are smaller and not quite so handsome. The Golden-backed
Hanging Parrot has a red forehead which is abruptly succeeded by
a broad line or bar of pure yellow running backwards over the centre
of the crown until it merges in the golden brown of the mantle. In
Worcester's Hanging Parrot the red extends right over the back of
the head, the pure yellow being absent. The female differs from her
mate in being without the red throat patch and in having her cheeks
tinged with pale blue. My pair, which arrived in very good plumage,
are at present thriving in a cage in the birdroom, being fed on apple,,
sweet grapes and liquid sunbird mixture composed of honey, Horlick's
milk, and Mellin's Food. The female Golden-backed Hanging Parrot,
to my lasting regret, was killed by the substitution of Nestle's milk
for Horlick's, an undetected error which cost me several small nectar-
feeding Parrots. The cock, in lovely condition, is now passing through
his second winter in an outdoor aviary provided with a heated shelter.

QUAILS

The genera Colurnix, Excalf actor ia, and Synoecus contain what may
be termed the true Quails. They are all small ground-birds, which
never perch, and feed upon seeds of weeds, green food, and insects.
The nest is formed in the grass, well hidden and generally approached
by a tunnel formed through the long grass. They are mostly desirable
birds for aviculture, providing suitable accommodation can be provided.
They must have a large grass run, and the grass, in part at least, be
allowed to grow to its full extent. They will only breed successfully
if able to completely hide their nests in the long grass. Without
sufficient cover many eggs may be laid, but no attempt will be made to-
incubate them. The birds should have access to a well-lighted and dry
shed, where they can dust themselves.
In captivity Quails require only Canary and millet seed, and such
green food as lettuce or chickweed during the winter, when the grass-
in their enclosure will not provide sufficient green food.

Quails, especially when first introduced into an aviary, frequently
injure themselves by dashing against the wire-netting covering their
aviary, and since they never perch, flight is not necessary and is, in
fact, a considerable danger to them in captivity. Hence it is desirable
that the non-perching Quails should be pinioned.

THE COMMON QUAIL AND ITS ALLIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998470586206897" page_id="56211474"  page_num="51" year="" vol="">
The genus Coturnix contains seven species, one of which, C. novce
zealandice, is probably extinct.
The Common or Migratory Quail ( C . coturnix) ranges over the
greater part of Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is captured in large numbers
in the south of Europe and North Africa for the table, and has
frequently been kept in captivity, but it is almost always excessively
wild in an aviary.
The Cape Quail ( C . capensis) is resident in South Africa, and is
distinguished from the Common Quail by a more reddish tinge to the
feathers, especially those of the cheeks. It is doubtful whether it can
be regarded as more than a resident race of the Common Quail, which
it resembles in its wild nature.
The Japanese Quail (C. japonica) closely resembles the Common
Quail, with which it is said to interbreed in its wild state. Ogilvie-
Grant has pointed out that in the female the feathers of the chin and
throat are elongated and pointed as in none of the other species of the
genus. It is not often imported, and has little to recommend it. A
white variety has been evolved in Japan, and some have been imported.
The Rain Quail ( C . coromandelica) and the next to be mentioned
are the two most desirable Quails from the avicultural point of view.
The Rain Quail inhabits the greater part of the Indian Peninsula,
migrating from one part of the country to another as the rainy season
approaches. The male Rain Quail is distinguished by a large black
patch on the middle of the chest; and it is somewhat smaller than the
other species of the genus. It is a free breeder in captivity if given
suitable accommodation.
The Harlequin Quail ( C. delegorguei) has the underparts rich
chestnut, with a large black patch on the middle of the breast. The
female is considerably darker in colour than that of the other species.

It is an inhabitant of Africa, south of about 15 degrees north latitude,
and is a local migrant. It is a handsome species, and usually tame and
a free breeder under suitable conditions. The most desirable of all of
the genus from the avicultural standpoint.
The Australian or Stubble Quail (C . pectoralis) is one of the
largest of the genus, being about 7 inches in length. In the male the
sides of the head, chin, and throat are dull red, the feathers of the
underparts are white with black shaft-stripes, and there is a black
patch on the chest. This is a free breeder in captivity, when the con-
ditions are suitable, but the species is seldom imported.
(For a fuller account of the Quails of the genus Coturnix and their
breeding in captivity the reader is referred to the Avicultural
Magazine of November, 1906.)

<bodyText confidence="0.993370523809524" page_id="56211475"  page_num="52" year="" vol="">
The genus Excalfactoria contains four species, one of which may
perhaps be regarded as merely a sub-species or local race of another.
The Painted Quails are very small, some 4 to 5 inches in length, and
the males are beautifully coloured, their upper parts being brown
blotched with black, with whitish shaft-stripes to the feathers, the
throat marked with black and white, the underparts being slate-blue
and chestnut. The Painted Quails are generally tame, and if kept in
a well-turfed aviary and the grass allowed to grow will breed quite
freely, producing two broods of five or six young in the season.
Incubation occupies about fourteen days, and the young, when first
hatched, are very minute and will pass through wire-netting of J in.
mesh ; they may, moreover, be unable to follow their parent through the
long grass, and we have found the safest way to rear them successfully
is to confine the mother and chicks in a run of some 3 by 4 feet and
9 inches high, formed with boarded sides and a wire top, half of which
should open for feeding purposes. The end of the run should be
removable, so that the brood is easily driven in. The run must contain
good cover in the form of long grass, and part of it should be covered
for protection from heavy rain. The young are best fed on living ants'
cocoons at first, the ants' nests being dug and placed in the run. They
soon pick up yolk of egg, and finally small Indian millet. We have

reared numbers of these Quails as well as three species of Coturnix,
one of Synoecus , and two of Turnix in this way with complete success.
The Chinese Painted Quail ( Excalfactoria chinensis) is the species
most frequently imported, and a most desirable addition to an outdoor
aviary. It inhabits the Indian Peninsula, Ceylon, the Indo-Chinese
countries, and Formosa. E. lineata , which is found in Australia, the
Philippines, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, is slightly smaller and con-
siderably darker, the chicks when first hatched being practically black.
We once bred this and the last in the same season, and the difference
in the appearance of the chicks was very marked.
The African Painted Quail (E. adansoni) occurs in tropical
Africa, and differs but slightly from E. chinensis . It is said to have
been imported, but we have never been fortunate enough to meet
with it.

THE SWAMP QUAILS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989832105263158" page_id="56211476"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
The genus Synoecus comprises three species of Quails inhabiting
Australia, New Guinea, and the islands of Timor and Flores, though
the species from these islands has not been imported. Swamp Quails
are generally very wild when first imported, but soon settle down in an
aviary which contains plenty of shelter in the form of long grass, and
the&amp;apos;two species that have been imported have bred in captivity, and
the young are reared without difficulty.
The Australian Swamp Quail ( Synoecus australis) inhabits the
whole of Australia and Tasmania, being known there as the " Brown
Quail ". It is about 7 |inches in length, the male being reddish-brown,
most of the feathers having greyish centres, and the whole being very
finely pencilled with zig-zag black lines. The female is easily
distinguished, being chiefly brown, spotted and streaked with black,
the feathers of the back being streaked with white. An account of
the breeding of the species in captivity will be found in the Avicultural
Magazine for October, 1905.
The Plumbeous Swamp Quail ( Synoecus plumbeus) inhabits south-
east New Guinea, and closely resembles the last, from which it differs
in being somewhat larger and the males greyer in colour.

Some of the daily newspapers have recently made a great deal of
copy out of the so-called Parrot Disease which it would seem, has not
confined itself to Parrots, but has been attacking human beings to
an alarming extent, especially in the vicinity of Berlin. To read some
of the-letters and articles that have appeared is apt to make one wonder
how anyone who has kept a Parrot has managed to escape !
The fact is that there is a disease known as psittacosis which
occasionally attacks Parrots which are imported under bad conditions.
Grey Parrots were at one time sent to this country in a very over-
crowded and insanitary state. Many died on the voyage and
the majority of the survivors lived but a short time after their arrival.
The condition in which Amazon Parrots sometimes arrive even to
the present day also leaves much to be desired. It is under such
conditions that the bacillus of psittacosis may suddenly become virulent,
and it has been proved that it can be communicated to man.
The effect on human beings is to cause pneumonia, and the fact
that in any case this disease is not rare, especially at this time of year,
and that Parrots are kept in many dwellings, is apt to lead to the
assumption that the disease is caused by the presence of the birds,
which does not necessarily follow.
While the owners of newly-imported Parrots would be well advised
to refrain from fondling, and especially kissing the birds, or allowing
them to take food from the mouth, the fact that many people have
handled hundreds, if not thousands, of these birds without ill effects f
goes to show that the danger is not so great as some would try to make
us believe, but that there may be a certain amount of danger must
be borne in mind.

The Pathologist at the Zoological Gardens tells me that he can
find no record of a case of &amp;apos;psittacosis amongst the Parrots at the Gardens,
and certainly in recent years every endeavour has been made to discover
a case of what is, to the bacteriologist, a very interesting disease.
The suggestion made in this Journal (Avicultural Notes, June
and August, 1929) that the Mandarin Duck might be naturalized
in London, seems to be in a fair way to being put in force, for Mr. Alfred
Ezra has recently received a consignment of these birds from China
and has given them for the experiment. Some thirty have gone to
St. James's Park, but some of these will eventually be sent to Hyde
Park and some to Regent's Park. They are only wing-clipped, so
that after the moult they will have their full powers of flight. Another
consignment, ordered some time ago by Mr. Spedan Lewis, is expected
to arrive in due course.
The Java Sparrow is a species that has been introduced success-
fully into countries other than its own. Writing on the birds of
Zanzibar and Pemba, in the current number of the Ibis, Mr. J. H.
Vaughan says of this bird : " I have been unable to discover when
and by whom this bird was introduced into Zanzibar. It is very
common in the town area, particularly near the Customs warehouses,
where it breeds in holes in the walls of the houses and is very tame.
I have not found it breeding outside the town area, but large flocks
are met with in the rice-fields and valleys as far afield as Mkokotoni."
Mr. Frost's discovery that the King Bird of Paradise is a hole-
breeding species is an event of considerable ornithological interest.
It had been thought that all of the Birds of Paradise constructed
open nests, and it was Mr. Frost who first suggested that some of
them nested in holes in trees. He had evidence that Uranornis rubra
at any rate adopted such situations. Now he has proved that
Cicinnurus regius undoubtedly does so.

Sir, --The Masked Lovebird appears to begin breeding at almost
as early an age as the Budgerigar. A cock, reared at liberty and still
unmoulted, who left the nest in September, has already paired with a
hen older than himself, and is very busy building. I noticed that my
hand-reared bird also came into breeding condition before he was six
months old. It is a remarkable sight in the dusk of a winter evening to
watch these quaint little birds preparing to go to bed in their logs and
boxes as cheerful and composed as though they were still in Africa,
and equally unmoved by hard frost or a furious gale raging through the
branches of the leafless trees.

should be made of how the different colours of the Budgerigar were
first obtained.
We know that in the wild state a yellow bird appeared occasionally
amongst the millions of greens. That the turquoise blue was obtained
by selection from thousands of imported birds. We also know that the
laurel is the crossing of a green and olive ; the cobalt a crossing of
mauve and turquoise blue; the yellow-white a crossing of white
and yellow. It would be interesting to know in what way, by whom,
and in which year the first olive, mauve, and white birds were obtained.
To this foundation record could be added the other colours we now
have--apple green, silverwing, etc.--and any colours which are
obtained in the future.
If your Society would make and keep such a record up to date, it
would I think, be of immense interest to aviculturists in years to come.
(Major) F. Lort-Phillips.
[We entirely agree with Major Lort-Phillips that the origin of the
various colour varieties of the Budgerigar should be placed on record,
and should be only too glad to publish any facts on the subject that
our members can supply. We should like to ask Major Lort-Phillips

Sir, --I have lately bought a pair of Eophona melanura and read a
description of them in the Avicultural Magazine for 1924, page 73,
and also in L'oiseau , where it first describes E. melanura and next
E. personata. The Avicultural Magazine misses out the latter bird,
but has put the description of it under the head of E. melanura. The
mistake has probably occurred in the translation from the French,
as it was written by Mr. Decoux. It is rather late to speak of it, but
I think I ought to call your attention to it.

Sir, --In answer to Mr. Finn's question re appearance of hen hybrid
Guineafowl. It closely resembles a pure Mitre, with a suggestion of the
purplish gloss on neck of the domestic species and with horn paler on
top of head than pure Mitre's. The young bred from this bird are not
quite full-grown, and are rather difficult to get near, being nervous,
but as far as I can see look mostly Mitre. Yes, hybrids often seem to
throw to a third species : young bred from a Snow Goose with a Canada
looked just like domestic Emden Geese ; though often, of course, the
hybrids are very one-sided, i.e. throw directly to one parent. A
Rosybilled Pochard X Red-Crested Pochard bred here this season was
practically pure Red-Crested to look at, and last year a Common
Wigeon X Gadwall appeared mainly Gadwall, and a Falcated X
Chestnut-Breasted Teal mainly Chestnut-Breasted. On the whole, it
is my experience that rarely are hybrids an improvement on their
parents. Two notable exceptions were some Common Wigeon X
Falcated we reared in 1926. In 1928 a pair of Egyptian X Ruddy
Shelduck which we sold to Mrs. Holmes, of the Node, Welwyn, who,
I think would agree with me when I say they are exceedingly fine birds.

Sir, --As I find " Notes from a Lancashire Aviary " very interesting
I thought some readers might care about some notes from a " North
Northumberland Aviary". As.I am able to keep quite small and
delicate birds in an outdoor aviary facing south and fairly sheltered,
I keep and breed Diamond Doves, Zebra Finches, and, of course,
Budgerigars, the latter being almost too prolific, each pair having
produced three and four nests, of eight birds in each, last summer. My
Cockatiels have wanted to nest but I have never yet found a nest to
suit them, they rather fancied a hollowed-out log with both ends open,

but never really settled down in it, and I should be glad of hints. Also I
have an odd Diamond Dove and should like to know how to tell whether
it is a cock or a hen. I also keep Nonpariels, Paradise Wydahs, Giant
Wydahs, Bronzewings and Bengalese Finches. I find Cordon Bleus
are unable to stand the winter here.
My heating arrangements consist of a hurricane lamp, the same as
we use for our chicken foster-mothers, and all the year round I give
my birds a small dish of scalded biscuit meal, dried off with hen meal
and mixed with hard-boiled egg, and it is to this I attribute my success,,
as the birds get a proportion of insect food in the meal and egg.

HEN GOULDIAN FINCH IN COCK'S PLUMAGE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993372857142857" page_id="56211482"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
Sir, --A few days ago a Gouldian Finch, which was caged in my
sitting room, died after being ill for twenty-four hours.
The bird was in perfect plumage, and, to all appearance, a brilliantly
coloured male. Mr. Hicks made a post mortem of the corpse, and ho.
pronounced that the bird was a hen. The ovaries were active and there
was a soft egg in the cloaca.
This bird was paired to a hen to which it frequently made court-
with the Gouldian's little song and dance.
I do not know its age or history. It was purchased last spring and
showed no sign of old age. Until recently the birds were in an outdoor
aviary, where they had had several nests. Naturally no young ones
were hatched. But for this death I might have wasted another season
in trying to breed from two hen birds.

Sir, --In the January number Dr. Hopkinson voices a query re

of complete success with this species, but, about 1902, the Rev. 0. D.
Farrar would seem to have been well on the way in that direction.
At that time this species was, as now, something of a rarity. The

Hon. Walter Rothschild, however, had two pairs, one of which he lent
to Mr. Farrar. The worthy Vicar of Micklefield had a flair for inducing
birds to take on domestic duties, and it was not long before the Brown's
commenced breeding operations. Three eggs were laid, one of which
hatched, the other two being clear. The youngster lived but a few
days. Shortly after they went to nest again, and this time three
youngsters were hatched. They did remarkably well until about three
weeks old, when they unaccountably died. They were very forward
and feathering nicely, and had the appearance of being two males
and a female. In sexing the youngsters at such an early age, Mr. Farrar
apparently relied on their varying size. Any further hopes of breeding
were brought to an end by the sudden death of the male. These
breeding attempts are described very fully in the Rev. Farrar's book
Through a Bird-room Window.
Unless the youngsters hatched in the aviaries of Lord Tavistock
(Avicultural Magazine, 1929, p. 234) were reared, it would seem
probable that the recent success of Messrs Boosey and Brooksbank

The beautiful Lory, Chalcopsitta insignis, whose picture forms
the frontispiece of our present number, inhabits north-west New
Guinea, and has, apparently, only once been brought alive to this
country, an individual having been imported by Mr. Wilfred Frost
in September, 1927, which, unfortunately, lived but a short time
after its arrival. In its form and actions the Raj a Lory closely resembles
the Black Lory ( C . ater). Its prevailing colours are rich purplish-black,
interspersed with bright red, dark blue, and violet and yellow. It
was described by Oustalet in 1878, and for many years after nothing
further was heard of the species, and it was thought that the bird from
which the original description had been taken might have been a
hybrid between C. ater and C. scintillatus. It is now known, however,
to be a good species.

The Quezal or Resplendent Trogon (Pharomacrus moccino) is one of
the world's finest birds (perhaps I should use the past tense, for I believe
this wonderful creature is practically extinct), excelling even the Birds of
Paradise in beauty; certainly it is, or w ; as,the most beautiful bird in the

New World. The size of a sm all Pigeon, it is clad in a raiment of scintillat-
ing golden green which changes according to the light. The head has a
fan-shaped crest of hair-like feathers, and the underparts are a rich
scarlet, but the chief beauty lies in the upper tail-coverts which are
enormously elongated, being about 3 feet or more in length and com-
pletely hiding the tail. These feathers are remarkably delicate and
silky, having the same kind of texture as the plumes of the Greater
Bird of Paradise, and they form a magnificent train. The wing-coverts
are also lengthened, and are sickle-shaped and almost meet across the
breast, both these and the feathers of the train being of the same
wonderful golden-green. But this lovely creature must be seen to be
fully appreciated.
Alas, its beauty has been its undoing, for, during the Victorian days
when there was a craze for feathers for women's headgear and cases
of brilliant stuffed birds, both of which crazes are now happily dead,
many hundreds of skins of this bird were exported to Europe where
they always fetched a good price, and now the birds being so rare the
skins command a still higher price ; but I don't think that any come
over now. Whilst in Costa Rica, the home of this bird, I made every
enquiry concerning it, but no one seemed to know anything about it,
even friends of mine who lived in the highlands of that country knew
nothing of ir, so I suppose we can conclude that it has joined the ranks
of many other lovely creatures which have been banished from this
earth by the greed of men and the selfishness of women.
This Trogon was found in the high mountain forests of Costa Rica
and also Guatemala, and we are told that the birds went about in small
parties of from ten to twelve, feeding upon fruit, especially acorns,
which they swallowed whole. In this respect they must differ from the
majority of Trogons, which feed upon insects. What a marvellous
sight it must have been to see these birds flying about in their native
forests looking like some brilliant golden meteor flashing through the
gloom with the wonderful train flowing behind. It is a thousand pities
to think that they may be no more. During the years when the skins
of the birds were in such demand in Europe, over eight hundred a year
used to be exported from the country and to supply this number we are
told that over a hundred men were busily engaged the whole year in

hunting it, but the number gradually got less and less until the bird was
practically unprocurable, which shows that the country must have been
pretty well denuded of them.
What a wonderful acquisition the bird would haye been to our
aviaries for, coming from such a height, three to six thousand feet,
it must have been able to stand the cold fairly well, and we are told
by M. Adolphe Boucard who, many years ago, sought out this bird in
its forest home, that ## it has been occasionally domesticated and kept
for several months in private houses. Sometimes it used to go about the
yard with the chickens or it would perch on a branch and stay in the
same place for hours. It was fed with seeds and fruit."
We have never seen it alive in Europe which is a great shame, for
by the above it would seem an easy bird to keep. Trogons are seldom
imported into this country ; I suppose they are difficult to catch and
accustom to artificial food. Years ago when I was a child I seem to
remember seeing some Cuban Trogons 1 advertised in Cage Birds,
but I forget the price asked for them. I have often made enquiries
but none ever seem to be brought here now, which is a pity for they
are lovely birds. Though I have never been able to keep them in
captivity I have been fortunate in being able to study them in their
native haunts and one species, the Narina Trogon (Hapaloderma narina)
which I was familiar with, in the dense African forests, seemed to
be entirely insectivorous.
In the breeding season the Quezal used to break up its small parties
and go about in pairs, when they would find a hole in a decayed tree,
usually the old nest of a Parrot or Woodpecker, for they are unable to
make a hole themselves owing to their beaks being so small and
fragile, where the hen laid one or two eggs about the size of a Pigeon's
and of a pale green colour. We read that ## the male bird sits on the
eggs ; meanwhile the female goes out for food. The position of the
bird is then very curious ; its head appears at the entrance of the hole
and the long feathers of the tail are spread over its head and are seen
outside the nest."

In remote times this bird was well known to the ancients and its
feathers formed part of the tribute paid to the king Montezuma by
the people in the provinces where the bird lived. The feathers were
used for making robes for the royalty of those days and very beautiful
they must have looked, though not so beautiful as on the living bird.
I have a pressing invitation to go and stay with friends in Costa
Rica, so one day when the skies of England prove too dull and the call
of the South is too strong and my ship comes in again to port, I may take
myself hence to the forests where this bird once roamed to see if perhaps
the race has not quite perished and to bring back the first living
specimens to the Old World ; but these dreams are still castles in
the air !

The American Quails, sub-family Odontojphorince , are a large group,
distinguished from the Old World Quails by the presence of a serrated
cutting edge to the lower mandible. They vary considerably in size,
some being as large as Partridges. They are mostly easily kept in
captivity, and will breed providing they are given ample covert, but
a dry soil is essential if they are to survive for any length of time.
Their food consists of small seeds, green food and insects, and the
young are easily reared, especially if an abundant supply of living ants'
cocoons is available. Sharp grit is essential for all game-birds. It
is not advisable to pinion or to cut the wing-feathers of Colins as they
are more arborial than the Old World Quails and roost in the branches
of trees or on a high perch at night. Most of the species are inclined
to be pugnacious towards other birds in an aviary.
The Scaly Coltn (Callipepla squamata) inhabits Mexico, Arizona
and Western Texas, its chief colour being grey, the feathers edged wdth
black, giving it a scaled appearance. The female differs in having
dusky shaft-stripes to the feathers of the throat, and is slightly smaller
than the male. Total length, about 10 inches.
The nest is made on the ground, the eggs being pale creamv-white,
finely spotted all over with reddish. A clutch consists of about twelve.

The Scaly Colin was successfully bred in the London Zoological
Gardens in 1913.
The Plumed Colin (Oreortyx pictus) inhabits the Western States
of North America. The sexes are nearly alike, the head being decorated
with two long black feathers. In the male the head, neck, mantle and
breast are slate grey, the remaining upper parts being olive-brown ;
the throat and foreneck deep chestnut margined by a white band. A
black patch on the cheeks. In the female the back of the neck is
more olive brown than grey.
The Californian Quail ( Lophortyx californicus) is by far the best
known species in Europe, as it is a comparatively common aviary bird,
and a free breeder. It is, moreover, one of the most ornamental of the
Colins, the male having an elegant crest of curved black club-shaped
feathers, a black throat margined with white, white eyebrow stripes,
the sides and back of the neck being grey spotted with white and
margined with black ; the breast buff shading into chestnut on the
abdomen and margined with black.
The female has a short brown crest and no black and white pattern
on the head.
The Californian Quail has been introduced into several parts of the
world and where the climate is suited to its requirements it has thriven,
but in Great Britain its introduction has not been successful, the climate
being too cold and damp. In an aviary it will breed very freely, the
nest being formed in any hidden corner. From twelve to sixteen eggs
are laid and the young are reared without difficulty, both parents
taking charge of the brood. In the Western States of North America
the species is known as the " Valley Quail ".
Gambel's Qltail {Lophortyx gambeli) is distinguished from the
Californian Quail by having (in the male) the back of the head chestnut
and no white spots on the back of the neck. The feathers of the breast
and abdomen have no black margins. The female is somewhat like
that of L. californicus, but has a more developed crest and no black
margins to the breast feathers, and the flanks are chestnut.
Gambel's Quail inhabits the Western States of North America:,
but is generally found at considerable elevations. It is rarely to be
obtained in Europe.

The Douglas Quail (Lopliortyx douglasi) inhabits Western Mexico.
The male has an upstanding crest of pale rufous ; the throat is black,
each feather being edged with white, the upper parts of the body with
triangular chestnut spots at the end of each feather, the sides and
flanks as well as the breast and abdomen spotted with white. The
female has the crest dark brown, the throat white with dark shaft-
stripes and the underparts greyish brown with white spots.
This is a very desirable species but rarely imported. It has bred
freely in the London Zoological Gardens.
The Mexican Barred Partridge (Philortyx fasciatus) inhabits
Southern Mexico, and has recently been imported. The sexes are alike
in plumage. The crest is blackish-brown, tipped with rufous ; the
back olive-brown mixed with black, the feathers being margined with
buff. Throat white. The under-parts are wdiite barred with black.
The Colombian Crested Quail (Eupsychortyx leucopogon) has a
crest of brownish-white, in the male, white ear patches margined with
chestnut, the chest rufous, barred with black and spotted with white.
In the female the crest is dark brown. Barely imported.
Sonnin's Crested Quail (E. sonnini) inhabits the northern parts
of South America, and differs from the last in having the ear-coverts
dirty white and the chest pale vinaceous, only slightly vermiculated
with black. It has been represented in the London Zoological Gardens.
Leyland's Crested Quail (E. leylandi) from Central America
has the throat black, the chest vinaceous and spotted with white.
The Curacao Crested Quail (E. cristatus) from the island
of Curacao and Aruba has the crest, top of the head and throat
buff ; a broad eyebrow-stripe and bands on the sides of the throat
black. The ear-coverts white. Back of the neck white, spotted with
black. The chest and flank feathers rufous, barred with black and
spotted with white. The underparts white, barred with black. The
female has the eyebrow'-stripes yellow.
The Virginian Colin or Bob-White (Colinus virginianus) is the
common Quail of the Eastern United States. The male has the chin
and throat white, surrounded by a black line. Ear-coverts chestnut, j
mantle rufous with grey edges, and barred with black. The middle of the
breast and abdomen w r hite barred with black. The female has the throat
bright buff.

This species is rarely imported nowadays, but has been intensively
bred in America in pens. It is a prolific species and would breed very
freely in suitable aviaries. The following species allied to the Bob-
White have been imported.
The Cuban Colin (C. cubanensis).
The Black-breasted Colin (C. pectoralis) from Eastern Mexico
bred freely in the London Zoological Gardens in 1912, twelve young
being reared.
Ridgway's Colin ( C . ridgwayi) has been imported.
The Montezuma Quail ( Crytonyx montezumce) inhabits Mexico,
and is an extremely beautiful species that has been imported from time
to time, but has proved to be somewhat delicate in captivity. The male
has a reddish-buff crest and the head is beautifully marked with black
and white. The body is pale rufous above, barred with black and buff
shaft-stripes, the middle of the chest being dark chestnut and the
sides dark grey with, white spots. The female lacks the black and white
pattern on the head. Length about 8 inches. The Montezuma Quail
w T as bred in France by Pichot in 1911.
The Guiana Partridge (Odontophorus guianensis) is a rather large
species, about 11*5 inches in length. It is a forest bird and has been
imported very rarely. The sexes are alike : crest chestnut, mantle
grey, mottled with black, rump reddish-brown, cheeks, chin and throat
chestnut, wings rufous, with black markings. Naked skin round the
eyes bright red.

The Francolins (Francolinus) are a large group of Partridge-like
birds inhabiting Asia and Africa. They resemble Partridges in their
habits, being frequently found in coveys, and feeding upon seed,
shoots of vegetation and insects. Clean, sharp grit must always be
supplied in captivity.
In captivity in Europe Francolins are hardy but thrive best on a
well-drained soil. Some species become very tame and will breed in

a large aviary if provided with ample covert. From six to eight eggs
are laid to a clutch, and the young can be reared without difficulty
providing an abundant supply of insect food, such as ants' cocoons,
can be supplied.
The Black Francolin (F. francolinus) occurs from Cyprus,
Palestine and Asia Minor eastward to India, and is one of the most
handsome of the Francolins, and the most desirable as an aviary bird,
though, unfortunately, not very often imported.
The male is black, spotted with wffiite, on the under-parts and upper
back, the lower back being barred with white. On the nape is a wide
chestnut collar, and on the hind part of the cheeks, a white patch.
The female is much browner, the sides of the face buff dotted with
black, and the throat white.
The Painted Francolin (F. pictus) occurs in Western and Central
India, somewhat resembles the last, the male differing in lacking
the chestnut collar. The forehead and sides of the head are reddish ;
the under-parts black spotted with white. The throat is rufous spotted
with black. The female differs in having the throat whitish.
The Chinese Francolin (F . pintadeanus) from the Indo-Chinese
countries. The male has no chestnut collar. The scapulars are chestnut
with whitish spots. A black band over the forehead passes behind the
eyes, and another across the cheeks. The female has the scapulars
black margined with brown and spotted with buff.
The Grey Francolin (F. pondicerianus) occurs from Eastern Arabia
and South Persia to India and Ceylon. The sexes are alike in colour,
being a mixture of brown and chestnut barred with buff. The under-
parts whitish buff with w T avy black bars. The male alone carries a
pair of spurs. This species is often trained by the natives of India,
and tame examples will follow their owners like dogs. They are
very pugnacious. This species was bred in 1927 by Dr. Amsler
(Avicultural Magazine, 1927, p. 289).
The Coqui Francolin (F. coqui) from East and South Africa..
The male has most of the head reddish-chestnut, the sides of the face
and neck yellow, the chin white. The upper surface grey and chestnut,
with yellowish shaft stripes. The female has black eyebrow stripes
and a black band on the throat.

The Spotted Francolin (F. spilogaster) from North-east Africa,
has been imported on a few occasions, and has been bred by Mr. Shore-
Baily (see Avicultural Magazine, 1927, p. 220).
The Grey-winged Francolin or Cape Partridge (F. africanus), a

rufous edgings to the feathers, the sides of the neck barred with black

The genus Piernistes contains about ten African species which only
differ from Francolinus in having the throat and a patch round the eyes
entirely bare of feathers, the naked skin being generally brightly
coloured. The colour is mostly brown or grey, the feathers having
wide shaft-stripes of black or white. Five species have been imported :--
The Cape Bare-throated Francolin (P. nudicollis) in which the
bare throat is crimson.
Sclater's Bare-throated Francolin (P. afer) from South-
western Africa, very similar to the last.
Swainson's Bare-throated Francolin (P. swainsoni), from South
Africa, naked skin rose-red.
Gray's Bare-throated Francoltn (P. leucoscepus) from Somali-
land, has the bare skin of the throat and round the eyes orange-red
shading into yellow. This species was bred by Sir William Ingram,
Bart., in 1905 (Avicultural Magazine, 1905, p. 352).

The Grand National Show at the Crystal Palace on the 6th, 7th,
and 8th February was, as usual, a great success. There was a record
number of entries--252 in the thirty-three classes ; but taken as a
whole they lacked the rarity which we have become accustomed to
expect at the " Palace ". There were, nevertheless, some very interest-
ing birds on view. Mr. Whitley's team was badly missed, and Captain
H. H. Liddell-Grainger did not send this year ; but Mrs. Victor Cooper
and Lord Tavistock again sent teams which met with considerable
success in their various sections. This year the " Chapman " Foreign
Bird Trophy was offered for the best foreign bird exhibit, and was
awarded to Mr. Andrew Wilson's Wilson's Bird of Paradise--this
bird just beating Lord Tavistock's Imperial Amazon. The Crystal
Palace Trustees most generously presented three National Foreign
Bird Trophies for the best bird in each of the three sections represented
by Parrot-like, Seed-eater, and Insectivorous or Nectar-feeding Birds.
These trophies were awarded to Lord Tavistock's Imperial Amazon,
Mrs. Victor Cooper's Violet-eared Waxbills, and Mr. Andrew Wilson's
Wilson's Bird of Paradise.
The hall was rather warmer than last year, but there is still need
for improvement; also the lighting is not as good as one could desire.
The show was again under the managership of Mr. A. J. Platon,
who deserves the thanks of all visitors for organizing such a large
and representative exhibition of birds--there were no less than 4,198
entries throughout the show.
The " Parrot " classes were considerably better than last year,
and contained some fine birds. The class for Lories, Lorikeets, and
Hanging Parrots had ten entries, and was won by Lord Tavistock's
Golden-backed Hanging Parrot, in perfect condition ; a good Yellow-
backed Lory sent by Mr. G. H. A. Hellen gained second, and third
was awarded to a pair of rare Worcester's Hanging Parrots (Mr. J.
Frostick). Lovebirds, etc., was a well-filled class, the best of the
sixteen entries being Mr. A. J. Freeman's Peach-faced, followed by

Mr. P. Abrahams' Abyssinian male, and Mr. W. R. Bearby's Black-
cheeks. The class for Bmtogerys , etc., was a failure, drawing but one
entry, a pair of Tovi Parrakeets, sent by Mrs. Hawker. Mr. G. H. A.
Hellen won the class for Cockatiels, Bed Rosellas, Common Ring-
necks, etc., with a good Red Rosella ; second went to Mr. T. Pembleton
for another Red Rosella ; third to Captain E. E. E. Hammond for an
Alexandrine.
There were but two entries in the class for the smaller Macaws and
more common Conures ; Mr. Erostick was first with a good Noble
Macaw, and Mr. J. W. Groves second with a pair of White-eared Conures.
Common King, Pennant's, Crimson-winged, etc., was another poorly
supported class--only five entries. Mr. Erostick's Stanley Parrakeet
fully deserved its first prize ; the same exhibitor's pair of Pennant's
gained second, and Mr. Willshire's Barnard third. The class for " All
other species of Parrakeets " contained three good birds, by far the
best being Lord Tavistock's Princess of Wales's (this bird and the one
in Mr. Whitley's collection are the only two in Great Britain) ; second
was awarded to Captain Hammond's Everett's Parrakeet, and third
to Mr. Willshire's Yellow-bellied. The next class for Grey, Timneh,
Senegal, and various specified Amazons provided a win for Mr. Maxwell,
his very excellent Rueppell's Parrot repeating its last year's success ;
second went to Mrs. K. Mearman's Eestive Amazon ; and third to
Dr. G. Elphick for a good Levaillant's. " All species of White and
Rose-breasted Cockatoos " gave the Crystal Palace Trustees some
little reward for their numerous unsuccessful entries in past years.
They were awarded first, second and third prizes for Sulphur-crested,
Leadbeater and Sulphur-crested respectively. Another win was
recorded by Mr. Maxwell in the class for " All other species of Cockatoos
and Macaws ", his Hyacinthine Macaw leading his Spix Macaw ;
Mr. H. J. Buckland's Blue and Yellow Macaw was third. The last
Parrot class, that for " All other species ", provided the section trophy
winner, Lord Tavistock's magnificent Imperial Amazon ; Mr. Maxwell's
Aubrey's Parrot and Mr. Erostick's Black-headed Caiques were second
and third.
Lord Tavistock gained first and second prizes in the class for
hybrids and abnormally coloured birds, the leader being his well-

for Dr. Elphick.
The next three classes for various common seed-eaters were won
by St. Helenas (Mrs. Victor Cooper), Cordon Bleus (Mrs. Victor Cooper),
and Rufous-backed Mannikins (Mrs. M. E. Warneford).
First and second prizes in the Common Grass-finch class were taken
by Mrs. Victor Cooper with a pair of Sydney Waxbills and Bichenow's
Finches ; third prize was awarded to Mr. Beauchamp for Chestnut-
breasted Finches. The class for the rarer Grass-finches and rarer
Waxbills contained twenty-four entries, and was won deservedly by
Mrs. Victor Cooper's Violet-eared Waxbills (section trophy winner) ;
second prize went to Mr. J. Cranna for a Peter's Spotted Finch, and
third to Mr. J. Sleigh for Dufresne's Waxbills. Mr. T. Goodwin
showed a pair of Ruficaudas which took fourth. Mr. Beauchamp
won the class for Buntings, Siskins, etc., with a good Red-crested
Finch ; Mr. Cranna was second with Red Siskins, and Mrs. A. A.

The Weaver and Whydah class received little support, only three
entries, one of which was absent; first Mr. E. Allison with a Taha
Weaver, and second Mr. Abrahams' Masked Weaver.
The class for Common Tanagers was not as good as last year, owing
to the absence of the Rev. R. B. Abell's birds. The premier award
went to Mr. Maxwell's Superb Tanager ; Mrs. M. M. Alexander took

There were four entries in the class for Shamahs, Mr. Erostick's

The Glossy Starlings and Spreos made a good class ; of the nine entries
Captain Hammond's Glossy--probably Rueppell's--was far ahead of
the others ; Dr. Elphick was awarded second for a pair of Green Glossy

Tickell's Ouzel being fourth : second was awarded to Dr. Elphick's
Abyssinian Starlings, and third to Mr. Beauchamp's Golden-fronted
Fruit-sucker. Three exhibits were staged in the class for Hangnests,
Troupials, etc., the best being Mr. L. M. Sutton's Yellow-crowned
Hangnest; Captain Hammond was second and third with a Black
and a Crested Cassique respectively. Mr. Maxwell won the class for
Pies, Jays, Barbets, Toucans, etc., with a splendid Green Toucanette ;
pairs of Alpine Choughs and Blue-crested Jays secured second and
third prizes for Dr. Elphick. There were three Birds of Paradise, the
first prize-winner being Mr. Andrew Wilson's Wilson's, adjudged the
best foreign bird in the show ; Mr. Wilson's King was second, and
Mr. Maxwell's Red third.
The two remaining classes were for " All other species of insectivorous
and fruit-eating birds c smaller than ' and ' larger than ' a Silver-eared
Mesia ". The former was won by Mrs. Pearse's Pigmy Woodpecker ;
second went to Mr. Allison's Bush Chat, and third to Mrs. Warneford's
Japanese Tit. The last class was won by Dr. Elphick, with a pair of
magnificent Bare-faced Touracos or Goaway Birds, of the genus
Gymnoschizorhis, probably new to aviculture. Mr. Maxwell was
second with a Black-throated Tanager, and Mrs. Pearse third with a
Bengal Pitta.

ON THE POSITION OF THE JACANAS AND
ON L'HERMINIER'S CLASSIFICATION OF
BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970138578947369" page_id="56211507"  page_num="74" year="" vol="">
By F. Finn
As an African Jacana ( Acto&amp;apos;pliilornis africanus ) has been for some
time on view at the Zoo of late, and as 1927 marked the centenary
of L'Herminier's Classification of Birds, I venture to draw the attention
of members to the systematic position of the bird, and to the above
classification, as it has hardly been noticed by anyone except by Newton
in the Introduction of the Dictionary of Birds , p. 52, and he does not
translate the French names of the families. I have been kindly
permitted to study the original paper in the Library of the Linnean
Society, where alone in London, so far as I know, can the journal
containing it be found. This is the Annates de la Societe Linneenne de
Paris , and the paper is in Volume Vie des Memoires. Newton gives
the journal as Actes, not Annates, but this slip is a trifling flaw in
the service he did in drawing attention to L'Herminier's brilliant work.
The paper has four plates, illustrating the breast-bones, etc., of a large
number of birds, this and adjacent parts of the bird's anatomy being
the basis of L'Herminier's classification. It is also the most convenient
part of a bird's skeleton to study : the great differences in the breast-
bones, etc., of the Fowl and Duck, as seen when they are carved,

must have struck everyone, and it is easy when a bird dies roughly
to clean these bones and allow ants or tadpoles to do the rest of the
work of skeletonizing.
L'Herminier, who was most modest, thought it a defect in his system
that birds of similar general form and habits were separated by it;
but here I can come to his assistance, for if one studies small details
rather than general form, external characters do confirm the findings
of anatomy. This can be studied in detail by anyone who has access
to my book The World's Birds, which, though now very scarce, can be
seen in a few scientific libraries--those of the Zoo, South Kensington,,
and the Horniman Museum. I give many figures illustrating such
characters. Like L'Herminier, I divide birds only into families, though,,
perhaps wrongly, I have cut his up as other ornithologists have done,,
in many cases ; but the point is, as Newton points out, that his actual
grouping was right. 1 It seems to me that to talk of " orders ", in
a class so uniform in outward form and anatomical structure as birds,,
is ridiculous ; Ostriches and Humming-birds are far more alike than
whales and mice, or tortoises and snakes, or sticklebacks and skate !
L'Herminier's classification, then, runs as follows: Accipitrines,.
Secretary, Owls, Touracous, Parrots, Humming-birds, Swifts, Nightjars,
Cuckoos, Trogons, Rollers, Bee-eaters, Kingfishers, Hornbills, Toucans,
Woodpeckers, Hoopoe-like birds, Passerines, Pigeons, Gallinaceous-
birds, Tinamous, Coots or Water-hens (includes all Rails), Cranes
(includes Trumpeter), Heron-like birds (includes Storks and Hammer-
head or Umbre), Ibises and Spoonbills, Waders (includes Plovers
and their allies, Bustards, Japanas and Plamingoes), Gulls, Petrels,
Pelicans (includes Cormorants, Gannets, and Tropic- and Prigate-
birds), Ducks (includes all Wildfowl), Grebes, Divers, Auks, Penguins.
All the Ratite birds (except Apteryx, which is not mentioned)
are classed in one family and called " Oiseaux normaux " ; he means
" anomaux ", for he has already called the above other birds
" normaux ". There are many misprints and a few other such slips 2
1 Newton overlooked his one error--the placing of the Flamingoes alluded to
later in this paper.
2 e.g. he says Linnaeus put " Pigeons " in Ardea, when he means " cigognes ",
Storks.

76 F. Finn--On the Position of the Jacands and on
in the paper, so that I fancy he could never have seen the proofs ;
he says he was just leaving France and might never return.
I think every aviculturist who has wandered in modern mazes
of museum manufacture will agree that this centenarian classification
is admirable ; only one thing appears to be wrong, and that is the
classing of the Flamingoes with the Plover-Snipe group--and even
here L'Herminier only just missed being correct, for he says that he
put them at first with the Ibises. I hope presently to show that in
the case of the Jacanas he was right, as usual.
The different types of Ratite birds are, also, distinct enough to
form at least families--Ostrich, Rheas, Cassowaries (including Emus) ;
but at any rate they are all representatives of a primitive type of
bird, all of which, except the Tinamous, have long lost flight. It
is very creditable to L'Herminier that he realized the Tinamous were
at any rate very distinct from the Gallinaceous birds, some of which
they so much resemble in appearance and habits. Examination of a
Tinamou's head will bear out what I have said about distinguishing
families by external characters ; the beak has a much deeper gape
than a Partridge's, and has the horny sheath divided into sections
by grooves, whereas the horn in true game-birds is uniform. Moreover,
the eyes have eye-lashes, usually not found in gallinaceous birds.
All these are Ratite characters, and so is the shortness of the Tinamou's
tongue. The absence in the Tinamou's feet of the rudimentary webs
found in those of game-birds is also a Ratite point, but not an exclusive
one, as the Ostrich has a short web between its two toes.
Nov/, applying this comparison of small details to Rails and Ja 9 anas,
we find that the latter, which have been classed with both Rails and
Plovers, have a complete Plover-bill, with slightly bulged tip and very
short gape. The form of the body is plump and Plover-like, not flat-
sided and Rail-like. The toes are completely without webs, which is a
Rail point, but one also found in some of the Plover group---Turnstones,
Snipes, and Stints. The wings have short quills as a rule, but not
shorter than those of the Painted Snipes in the Plover family, which
have a Rail-like flight; and the Pheasant-tailed Jacana has longer
wings even than most Plovers, flies like a Lapwing, and has been seen
mobbing a Marsh-harrier on the wing--fancy a Rail doing that 1

This Indian species is the only one the Zoo has ever shown before.
In Africa I noted that the A. africanus looked midway between
Lapwing and Moorhen--I saw it fly.
The spurred wings and lappet-decked heads of most Jacanas are
reminiscent of what is found in some Lapwings ; the Pheasant-tailed
Jagana lays peg-top-shaped eggs of the true Plover shape, and downy
young Jacanas are variegated, not uniform black like young Rails
in the down.
The long and very straight claws of Jaganas are very unlike anything
in the Plover group, but unlike Rails' claws also ; the well-developed
hind-toe is also exceedingly weak, and the whole foot deficient in grip,
while Rails grip strongly and do so when fighting, while Jaganas fight
with their wings like Plovers--at any rate the Pheasant-tailed species
does so, and this also bobs its head like a Plover, while no Jag an a
so far as I know jerks its tail in Rail fashion. Moreover, the Pheasant-
tailed Jagana shows a distinct resemblance in colour to the leaf-running
Plovers of the genus Defilippia (now Hemiparra), of which one can be
seen at the Zoo.
On the other hand, no Jagana has an equally definite resemblance
to any sort of Rail--the Rail-like appearance is merely general, and in
the case of the Pheasant-tailed species is almost confined to the large
feet, which in the family generally are really very different in detail from
any Rail's. Moreover, the Crab-Plover (Dromas ardeola), a most
interesting and handsome bird wdiich has yet to be imported alive,
is undoubtedly related to the Plovers, even if rightly given a family of
its own ; and this bird has a quite well-developed hind-toe, its feet
resembling those of a Stork in miniature. Indeed, it has been classed
with the Storks, though L'Herminier acutely suggested that it and also
the Sheathbill would be found related to the Plovers, as is now&amp;apos; admitted.
This acuteness of his in placing birds of which he did not know the
anatomy w r as most remarkable, and in this he was possibly guided
by small external characters unconsciously, as I was before I worked
the matter out. He suggested, for instance, that the Limpkin or Courlan
(Aramus ) w r ould. be found nearer the Crane than the Stork, and this
also is right--it comes between Cranes and Rails, and nearer to the
former. He also mentions the Sun-bittern at the end of the

Cranes, and even suggests that the Sand-grouse should he near
the Pigeons.
I cannot find that he mentions Hemipodes, Barbets, or Screamers,
and the Kagu was not then known. He suggested, however, that the
Cariama might come near the Secretary. He also went wrong over the
Lyre-bird, which he thought would be near the Megapodes, by the form
of its feet and wing and its habits ; it is, we now know, a Passerine,
though of a very primitive type, as shown by its downy young. The
foot has the enlarged hind-toe characteristic of all this huge group,
and, as in all of them, is without any web, whereas the Megapodes
have a rudimentary web, between the two inner front toes only, not
between all the front three as in other game-birds. But on the whole
his classification marks him as the greatest ornithologist we know.

Dr. Hopkinson is spending the winter in making a trip to Australia
and New Zealand, and is finding great enjoyment in meeting fellow
acivulturists and seeing their collections. The wild birds are also
proving of the greatest interest. Writing from Melbourne, he tells of
a visit to a large station forty miles away, where Piping Crows and
Kosella Parrakeets were the commonest birds after the introduced
Mynahs and House Sparrows. This, he says, is a feature of Australian
bird life ; whenever one sees any number of birds together they are
always foreign, not native. " A flock of fifty Goldfinches, however,
in a hayfield does not disgust one in the same way as do the herds of
House Sparrows which are everywhere except in Western Australia."
He found that the native birds required looking for, but in the
Melbourne Botanical Gardens Blue Wrens were plentiful and tame,
while Pied Grallinas, Bell Miners, and Fantail Flycatchers were also
there.
Dr. Hopkinson's trip to the large station reminds me very vividly
of a similar trip I took more than twenty years ago, perhaps to the

same station, with, that splendid Australian ornithologist, Archibald
Campbell, who, alas, has recently died. On that occasion the most
common bird there was, I think, the White-backed Magpie (Piping
Crow) and probably next came Phe Rosella, but the Sparrow and the
Mynah had not appeared, or were at least decidedly uncommon, though
plentiful in the towns, which seems to show how, since then, these
aliens have extended their range, and are probably ousting the native
birds.
The number of aviculturists in Australia is increasing, though at
present there are practically none in Western Australia and Queens-
land. Those there are are very keen, and are willing to pay high
prices for rare birds. Mr. S. Harvey, of Adelaide, has had great
success in breeding Queen Alexandra and Turquoisine Parrakeets,
the former having bred for three years past. African Weavers have
also bred very successfully, and he has kept a Dufresne's Waxbill
for five years.
I was very interested in the pair of Bare-faced Touracos exhibited
at the Palace by Dr. Elfick. I make them out to be Gymnoscizorhis
personates, from Southern Abyssinia and Shoa ; a slightly different
form, G. leopoldi, comes from Tanganyika. These birds, and those of
the closely allied genus, Corythaixoides or Schizorhis , one of which
was illustrated in our last number, are known in Africa as ' 6 Goaway
Birds
Referring again to the experiment which I suggested some months
ago of trying to establish the Mandarin Duck as a full-winged breeding
species in the London parks, it is satisfactory to be able to report
that about forty pairs of these birds have now been handed over to
the care of H.M. Office of Works, thanks to the generosity of Mr. Alfred
Ezra and Mr. Spedan Lewis. These are only wing-clipped, and so
will regain their powers of flight at the next moult. They are being
placed in St. James's Park, Hyde Park, Greenwich Park, Regent's Park,
Hampton Court, and Buckingham Palace Gardens, while six additional

The acclimatization of these birds in this country has been quite
successful at Woburn, Netherby, and Fallodon, and at the last of
these Lord Grey tells me he has some fifty full-winged, which come for
food daily and are very tame, while Mr. St. Quintin describes a visit
he paid to Fallodon with Mr. Meade-Waldo last September. He tells
me that the ducks are liberally fed just at dusk, and so do not feel the
need to stray away for more food. At one of these evening feeds the
ducks were so fearless of their human friends that at one time " each
of us had a Mandarin sitting on his hat ! "
The January number of the Emu is, as usual, a most interesting
publication. It contains a coloured plate illustrating two well-known
Parrakeets, namely Barraband's and the Rock-peplar, but the names
given to them are new to us, namely " Superb " and " Regent " Parrots.
Why it should be thought necessary to create new English names to
well-known species it is difficult to see. The number contains many
very beautiful photographs of Australian birds, mostly taken at their
nests, and a portrait of the late Mr. A. J. Campbell, an ornithologist
and all-round naturalist of the highest quality who was admired
and loved by all who knew him.
The old Parrot House at the Zoological Gardens will very soon
either be demolished or used for some other purpose than that which
it has served for so long. In it have just been reared two Forsten's
Lorikeets, now out of the nest and hale and hearty. The old House
was built about the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and its
first occupants were Gould's collection of stuffed Humming Birds,
which attracted much attention.
Lord Tavistock attributes a case of feather-plucking in a Yellow-
bellied Parrakeet to sunflower seed, yet a lady, writing in Cage Birds
a short time ago, tells of how she cured cases of feather-plucking by

feeding liberally upon sunflower, hemp, fat bacon, and bread and butter,
her theory being that the habit is due to a lack of fats in the food.
A Ganga Cockatoo in the Parrot House commenced feather-plucking
and the keeper was advised to entirely withhold sunflower seed. The
result of this was that the bird continued to pluck his feathers with
renewed vigour. The sunflower was then replaced in the bird's rations,
more liberally than formerly, and in a short time the bird ceased to
pluck its feathers and is now in good plumage.

REVIEW
THE BIRDS OF WEST AFRICA 1
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.955866" page_id="56211514"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
A good book on the birds of West Africa has long been wanted,
not only by systematic ornithologists but by aviculturists, for many
of the most freely imported of foreign cage-birds come to us from the
West Coast, and every aviculturist worthy of the name wishes to know
about the wild habits of the birds that adorn his aviaries. The book we
have been waiting for has now appeared, and the author is none other
than Mr. G. L. Bates, who has spent over thirty years of his life in
collecting and observing the birds of this, his adopted country.
The limits of West Africa for the purpose of this book extend from
Senegal to French Cameroon. There are three very distinct types of
country each with its own forms of bird life. To the north is the semi-
arid country consisting of scanty grass and thorny scrub suitable for
semi-desert forms ; then comes the Savannah country, where the
grass grows to a considerable height and the birds are mostly those
which feed upon the seeds of grasses. Finally, in the coastal regions,
we find the mighty forest country where one travels in semi-darkness ;
the lowest limbs of the trees are a hundred feet from the ground, and
the birds, such as Hornbills and Touracos, can be heard but not seen,
for they frequent the tops of these forest giants.
Mr. Bates is well acquainted with each of these regions, and with
their various types of bird life, and of each bird he tells us something

of interest and gives us an accurate description, though some of the
trivial names he has adopted are not those which have been accepted
by aviculturists. For instance, we know Euplectes franciscana as the
Orange Weaver or Bishop, but this name is applied by Mr. Bates to
another species --Ploceus aurantius, while the&amp;apos; Red-faced Lovebird,
Agapornis pullaria is only given a native name.
Of the Grey Parrot which we know so well as a cage-bird, it is
interesting to hear something concerning its wild habits ; " Only out
in Africa / 5 we read, " can one feel the sense of wild freedom they bring
as they scream high overhead in the forest. They carry their heavy
bodies, in flight, at great speed, with rapid wing strokes. They perch
high, and have certain roosting places to which many resort at evening.
They prefer openings and clearings to the dense forest, and breed in
holes in the very high trees always left standing in clearings. Natives
bestow much labour in contriving a way to climb these hundred-foot-
high branchless trunks, using bush-ropes and notches or other means of
providing footholds, in order to take the half-grown young. They find
generally, I think, two young in the solitary nest or hole. A peculiar
noise one hears from high trees sometimes, kept up all day with little
cessation, is the call of the young for food .' 5
Firefinches, Cordon Bleus, Silverbills, and various Weavers are
freely met with, the Weavers going unnoticed while in the " sparrowy "
plumage, but the cocks blossoming out in July into their brilliant
dresses " as if bursting into blossom on the tall grass stalks."
The Common Firefinch is a very familiar little bird, breeding in the
thatched roofs of the native huts and entering dwellings freely.
Mr. Bates relates how once, when he was lying in the afternoon in a
rough shed, a pair of Firefinches came in and one sang its sweet piping
notes within a few feet of his couch.
This book is well illustrated with text-figures by Mr. Gronvold,
mostly intended to show the distinguishing characters such as the bills
or feet of the various species, a useful feature in a book of this kind. We
can very heartily recommend the book to all who are interested in
West African birds, and this includes most aviculturists.

BROWN'S PARRAKEET

<bodyText confidence="0.94250564" page_id="56211516"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Further to my letter under the above heading which
appeared in last month's number of the Avicultural Magazine. At
the time of writing, I unaccountably overlooked the article by Lord
Tavistock in the Avicultural Magazine, October, 1928. In this, Lord
Tavistock fully describes his trials and disappointments before finally
succeeding in rearing this species; and, of course, the young were
reared some considerable time before those of Messrs. Boosey and
Brooksbank.
A. A. Prestwich.
Sir, --In reply to Mr. Prestwich's letter, Brown's Parrakeet was
first bred by a lady in Scotland many years ago, the same, if I am
not mistaken, who bred the Eclectus Parrot. I reared young from
two pairs in 1928, and from one pair last season. At present I have
a stock of about a dozen birds, mostly unrelated, and hope to keep
the species going for a considerable time.
Tavistock.
Sir,-- It appears from the February number of the Avicultural
Magazine, that Mr. A. A. Prestwich believes us to be the first successful
breeders of Brown's Parrakeet in Great Britain.
We fear, however, that this distinction is not ours, as the species
has been fully reared on two occasions, at least in Lord Tavistock's
aviaries at Warblington.

through the summer and carried nesting material. In autumn,
acting partly on the advice of people with more experience of Tanagers
than myself, I stopped giving the sunbird mixture. The effect was
most disastrous, for in December both cocks died in very fair weather,
and the hen lost her spirits and never left the heated shelter. I renewed
the sunbird mixture, and she practically lived on it for days, ignoring
the fruit, and after a while regained her hardiness and activity, spending
much time in the flight as before. From this it seems certain that
sunbird mixture, if too rich and fattening for Calliste Tanagers in
heated buildings, is essential to their well-being when they are kept
partly in the open.

Sir,-- During a recent trip to Cuba I was most fortunate in obtaining
five of the rare Cuban Todies in perfect condition. I took these through
the Canal with me on the way home, but, alas ! they would only eat
live mealworms, and of these I had only a very limited supply. Only
one lived until San Francisco, and that one died the next day. I was
almost frantic over my great loss as ever since I started my hobby
of collecting soft-billed birds I have dreamed of having these birds.
I tried everything during the voyage from hard-boiled egg to ants' eggs,
which I floated on their water. These they ate very sparingly of, and
I wondered that they lasted as long as they did. Has anyone ever had
success with these marvels of bird life ? I have collected softbills for
nineteen years, but have never had that much hard luck with any
birds.

I believe this is so, although my personal experience of the White
variety is very limited.
In 1928 a pair of Blues reared five Whites besides Blues ; I knew
that the lady from whom I had bought the Blue cock had bred Whites,
and she informed me that my bird had come from the same nest as
Whites--its parents having been two Blues. All the five Whites had
very little blue on the breast, and one of the hens which was exhibited
was described by a judge as being the best White he had seen for a long
time.
Last year I mated this Blue cock to a Green-Blue hen, and
she produced two Apple Greens, as well as Blues and Greens.
Although on principal I am against inbreeding, I am this year
going to mate the Blue cock to one of his White daughters.

Sir, --Last autumn, by way of adding variety, I unwisely added
sunflower seed (one of the principal ingredients of packet Parrot foods)
to my stock mixture. The result was that a few days later a very
nice cock Yellow-bellied Parrakeet I had had for two years in show
condition in a couple of days plucked every feather from his body, so
that, with nothing left but long black down, he resembled a Persian
kitten ! As he was a trained liberty bird I at once turned him loose,
little doubting that a change of scene and diet would effect a speedy
cure ; but although he has been free for six months and has been
living entirely on the wild foods he picks up for himself he is as dis-
reputable now as on the day of his release. I have never known so
intractable a case of feather-plucking.

ON THE BREEDING OF THE SARUS CRANE
(GRUS ANTIGONE, LINN.) AT TRING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97536005" page_id="56211532"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Lord Rothschild, F.R.S.
We have had two Sarus Cranes at Tring since the summer of 1915.
The female of the breeding pair was presented to my late brother in
1915 by Lord Newton as a male, and I got a second bird in the same
year from Marseilles, which lived till 1924 and proved on dissection
to be, as alleged, a female. I purchased my present male from
Mr. Chapman in 1924 when about 18-20 months old, or even, perhaps,
only 15 months old.
The two birds began to pair in 1925. A nest was begun on 17th July,
and the first egg laid on 20th July and the second on 22nd July. The
female began to incubate at once on the 22nd, and the eggs were
taken away on 8th September; they proved unfertile. A second
nest was built on 22nd September, and the eggs were laid on the 23rd
and 27th ; the eggs again proved unfertile.
The nest consisted of dry grass, dry nettle stalks and small pieces
of wood. The male did not sit and the female often left the nest for
a short time. In 1926 a nest was hurriedly constructed on 28th June
and an egg laid, followed by a second on 30th June. After forty-seven
days' incubation the eggs again proved unfertile. On 29th and 30th
August two eggs were again laid in a very small and carelessly built nest

and were only intermittently brooded by the female; they also were un-
fertile. In 1928 seven eggs were laid between 8th July and 20th August,
some on bare ground and others in an imperfect nest, and unless taken
away immediately, were broken and eaten by the birds. On 2nd and
24th August two further eggs were laid and well incubated by the
female, but did not hatch, though one egg showed traces of fertility.
In 1929 a small nest was made inside the hut and the eggs were laid
on 2nd and 5th July and afterwards destroyed and eaten by the male.
The nest was considerably enlarged on 10th July and an egg laid
on 12th July. This was not destroyed, and the female remained most
of the time beside the nest as if to protect it. On 14th July the second
egg was deposited and the female sat intermittently on the nest. On
the 15th she began to incubate properly and for the first time the male
was observed to incubate the eggs alternately with the female. The
male now became exceedingly savage. On 19th August the first young
one was hatched, and on the 20th the second, and the first one could
be seen walking about on the edge of the nest. In the evening the
female tried to feed the first young one by picking up food in its beak
and offering it to the young one, but the latter was not seen to swallow
anything.
On 21st August both young ones were observed to leave the nest
and get just outside the hut with the female.
When food was placed in the pan for the parents a most interesting
scene was witnessed, the two old birds trying to feed the young or
else showing them how to pick it up. Very finely shredded liver was
then put down and the parents picked up this meat and rubbed it
against or shook it near the tip of the young ones' bills and then putting
it down for the young to try and pick up. Sometimes they held it
in their own bills till the young got the idea of taking it away, varying
these methods several times ; but never actually placing the food
inside the bills of the young ones, nor did the latter open their mouths
as if expecting this.
On 29th August the young Cranes were observed for the first time
to hunt for and pick up insects for themselves. On 8th October
flight feathers first strongly apparent, and on 20th feathers all over
wings, thighs and tail were visible. On 19th December one young

bird started to fly and we bad to cut one wing. Tbe colour of the young
birds is darker, more ashy grey with a browner tinge than in the adults,
and the upper neck and head are covered with dark rusty buff downy
feathers.
On 24th February second plumage, paler grey, feathers began to
show distinctly on the neck and back.
The female, which has been at Tring now fifteen years, was in Lord
Newton's possession and elsewhere for a number of years, and so must
be well over twenty years old, while the male is only seven or eight.
As far as I have been able to find out, there is in the last one hundred
years no other record of the successful rearing in captivity of the
Sarus Crane, though young have been hatched on more than one
occasion.
The one young bird is much larger than the other, so they are
evidently male and female.
The only record I have been able to find of the successful breeding
and rearing of the Sarus Crane in captivity is in the diary of the
Moghul Emperor Jehangir (a.d. 1605-27) (see Journ. Bomb. Nat. Hist.
Soc., vol. xxxii, pp. 57-60, 1927).
I am indebted for the observations on the feeding, moulting, etc.
of the two young birds to Frederick Young, the taxidermist and
caretaker of the Tring Museum.

The Partridges form a large group of birds, many of which have
been successfully kept in confinement. The aviary in which they
are kept should be large with an extensive open flight containing
abundant cover, both in the form of grass and low shrubs. The soil
should be light, as a heavy clay soil does not suit them. Given
suitable conditions most species will breed and rear their young;
successfully. Their food consists in the main of small grain, but they
are also large consumers of insects and green food and require grit..

The Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris) form a very distinct
group in which the sexes are alike in plumage but can be readily
distinguished by the presence of spurs in the male. They breed
freely in captivity if given a large enclosure with plenty of covert.
They are very noisy and, as a rule, become tame to the extent,
occasionally, of being aggressive. They are apt to be quarrelsome
with other allied species of birds. The nest is formed on the ground,
of leaves and grass, usually sheltered by a tuft of grass, and the clutch
consists of from ten to fifteen eggs. These birds will sometimes
lay freely in quite a small aviary, and the eggs can be collected and
set under domestic hens, when the chicks can be reared without
much difficulty, especially providing an abundant supply of live
ants' eggs is available.
The Chukor Partridge (A. chukar) has an exclusive range
throughout Asia, and many local races or sub-species have been
described. It is greyish-brown above, the breast grey, and abdomen
rufous-buff, the throat and fore-neck white, surrounded by a band
of black ; lores whitish, ear-coverts chestnut.
The Chukor becomes extremely tame in captivity, and has bred
very freely in Mr. Alfred Ezra's park in Surrey, where the soil is
light and sandy.
The Greek Partridge (A. saxatilis) occurs in the mountains
of Southern Europe, and closely resembles A. chukar , but has the
lores and ear-coverts black, the latter being mixed with buff. This
species was bred in the London Zoo in 1905.
The Common Ked-legged Partridge (A. rufa) is a handsome
species, darker and more richly coloured than the Chukor, the feathers
of the chest being margined on the sides with black. Its habitat
is Southern Europe, and it has been introduced into Great Britain
as a game-bird.
The Barbary Red-legged Partridge (A. &amp;apos;petrosa ), from North-
West Africa and Sardinia, is recognized by the top of the head being
dark chestnut and a collar of chestnut spotted with white bordering
the sides and front of the neck.
The Black-headed Partridge (A. melanocephala), from Arabia,
is the largest and most handsome of the Red-legged Partridges,

and is easily recognized by its large size and black top to the head,
a wide black band surrounding the throat and continued down the
middle of the neck. This fine Partridge has been bred by Mr. Herbert
Whitley, as described in the Avicultural Magazine for 1928, p. 101,
where a coloured drawing of the bird is reproduced.
The Seesee Partridges ( Ammoperdix ), of which only three
species are known, are small desert-loving birds of an isabelline or
sand-colour, a black band across the forehead passing backwards
over the eyes. The flank-feathers of the male are longitudinally
barred with chestnut and black in striking contrast to the rest of the
plumage. The female lacks the black markings on the head, and
the barring on the flanks.
Bonham's Seesee Partridge (A. bonhami) occurs in South-
West Asia.
Hey's Seesee Partridge (A. heyi ), a paler coloured bird, occurs
in Arabia and Palestine.
Cholmley's Seesee Partridge (A. cholmleyi) is the form
inhabiting Egypt and Nubia. Seesee Partridges are very delightful
birds in captivity, but must be kept in a perfectly dry aviary with
sand and rocks. They cannot stand damp. Specimens kept in the
London Zoological Gardens laid freely and several young were reared.
The True Partridges ( Perdix )
The Common Partridge (P. perdix) is too well known to require
a description, but it may be well to refer to a mark of distinction
in the sexes which was pointed out by Ogilvie-Grant some years
ago. The wing-coverts of the male have only a buff shaft-stripe,
whereas those of the female have, in addition, buff cross-bars. The
presence or absence of the horse-shoe marking on the breast is not
an infallible distinction. Common Partridges when reared from the
eggs under domestic hens are very tame and delightful birds,
and will breed freely in captivity, such as in a wired enclosure, the
birds having one wing cut to prevent flight. The cock bird becomes
quite aggressive towards the breeding season.
Hodgson's Partridge (P. hodgsonice), from Southern Tibet,
has been represented in the London Zoological Gardens.

The Madagascar Partridge (Margaroperdix madagascariensis)
has been kept and bred in France.
The Indian Bush Quails (Perdicula). This genus comprises
two small species which are generally classed as Partridges, and in
their habits resemble these birds rather than the Quails.
The Jungle Bush Quail (P. asiatica) inhabits India and Ceylon.
In the male the upper parts are brown with pale buff shaft-stripes
on the back and black markings on the wings. Bnderparts white
with black bars. Forehead, throat, and stripes above the eyes
chestnut. The female is of a uniform vinaceous buff.
The Rock Bush Quail (P. argoondah) has much the same habitat
.as the last, from which it differs in being of a more brick-red colour.
It appears to be a bird of the rocky plains, whereas the other is found
in the forest country. Both species have been freely imported,
but are shy and difficult to tame.
The Bamboo-Partridges ( Bambusicola ) have the tail rather
long and wedge-shaped, and the sexes similarly coloured. They are
frequenters of dense grass and bush and rarely met with in the open.
They are very quarrelsome, and perch on the branches of trees.
Fytche's Bamboo-Partridge (B. fytchii) occurs in North-
Eastern Bengal, Northern Burma, and Indo-Ohina, and has been
imported on very rare occasions. It is brown in colour with the
nape chestnut, the back dark chestnut mottled with white, the
wing-coverts marked with buff, chestnut, and black, the eyebrow
striped, cheeks and throat grey.
The Chinese Bamboo-Partridge ( B. thomcica) is not very
unlike the Common Partridge. Olive-brown above, marked with
chestnut on the back, with white and buff markings.
The Formosan Bamboo-Partridge (P. sonorivox) is like the
last, but more richly coloured.
The Red Spur-Fowl ( Galloperdix spadicea) has the tail moderately
long and rounded, and the male is armed with two or more pairs
of spurs, the female frequently carrying spurs also. It occurs in
Western India, and is very rarely imported. The male is reddish-
chestnut, the feathers margined with greyish-brown, the sides of the
head and neck being greyish-brown. The female differs in having

the feathers of the neck and underparts tipped with black, and the
upper parts of the body barred with black and buff.
The Tree Partridges (Arborophila) are a group of purely forest-
loving birds, never found in the open country. They have very
 |short tails and rounded bodies, and spend most of their time scratching
amongst the fallen trees and undergrowth for insects, seeds, shoots,
and berries, upon which they chiefly feed. They are rarely if ever
found in coveys, but generally in pairs. The call is a musical whistle.
Except in one case the sexes are alike in plumage. Some four or five
species have been imported and have proved to be very desirable
aviary birds, especially where their enclosures are planted with
plenty of covert and provide ample facilities for scratching.
The Common Tree Partridge (A. torqueola) inhabits the outer
ranges of the Himalayas and is the only species in which the sexes
differ in plumage. The male has the crown bright chestnut, the
back olive-brown barred with black ; wings marked with chestnut
and black ; the sides of the face and throat black, the feathers
edged with white, the neck white, and chest grey. The flanks are
grey, the feathers edged with chestnut and spotted with white.
The female has the crown brown, the sides of the face, throat, and
neck reddish with black spots. This species has been bred in France.
The following additional species have been imported: A.
atrigularis, from North-Eastern India ; A. henrici, from Annam ;
A. crudigularis, from Formosa ; A. rufigularis, from the Himalayas ;
A. javanica, from Java.
Of the closely allied genus Tropicoperdix, sometimes known as
Wood Partridges, four species have been imported, namely, T.
merlini, from Annam ; T. chloropus, from the Eastern Pegu Hills
and Cochin China ; T. charltoni, from the Malay Peninsula ; and
T. tonkinensis, from Tongking.
The Roulrqul Partridge
The Crowned Wood Partridge or Roulroul (Rollulus
roulroul) is the only species of its genus, and an extremely beautiful
and very desirable species. The male may be described as green,
strongly glossed with blue, the head being black, with the crown

white and a long full maroon crest on the hinder part of the head, and
a tuft of long, black, hair-like bristles on the forehead. The wings
rufous-brown ; the legs and feet bright red, and a bright red ring
of skin round the eyes. The female is bright grass-green with the
head grey, and she lacks the rufous crest.
This lovely bird inhabits the dense covert of the Malay forests,
finding its food--which consists of seeds and insects---by scratching
amongst the leaves. The species was successfully bred in Devonshire
in 1926, an account of this interesting event, by Mr. Herbert Whitley,
appearing in the Avicultural Magazine, together with a coloured
plate, in October, 1927.
The Stone Partridge
The Stone Partridge (Ptilopachys fuscus) inhabits Western
and North-Eastern Africa, where it inhabits the bare stony hill-sides,
being found in flocks of coveys. It is rarely imported, and those
we have met with have been extremely wild. The sexes are alike,
brown in colour, finely mottled with whitish. The tail is rather long
and rounded, and there is a large naked space behind the eye.

Grouse are distinguished by having the feet more or less covered
by feathers. The nostrils are also feathered, and the hind toe is raised
considerably above the level of the others and there are no spurs.
Speaking generally, Grouse may be said to be somewhat difficult
subjects in captivity, though, under suitable conditions, they are very
interesting and attractive birds. To keep any species of Grouse
successfully a large enclosure, on dry soil and with plenty of cover,
is essential. Hot summer sunshine is detrimental to them, and adequate
shade must be provided. As to food, grain such as wheat and dari,
canary, millet, and hemp-seed suits them, with abundance of green
food and a good supply of clean, sharp grit is essential, and they must
always have access to clean water. During cold weather meal, such
as barley-meal mixed with a little ground meat, is desirable.

Heather may not be essential, but it is very desirable, especially
for the Red Grouse.
The Willow Grouse (Lagopus lagopus) has a circum-polar range,
inhabiting Arctic Europe, Asia, and America. In summer plumage
it somewhat resembles the Red Grouse of Scotland, but changes its
plumage as the cold weather approaches until in winter it becomes
pure white with the exception of the outer tail-feathers, which do not
change. The Willow Grouse has not often been kept in captivity,
but it would appear to be one of the least difficult and to be very ready
to breed in confinement. Some twenty years ago Mr. W. H. St. Quintin
obtained six birds, all of which proved to be hens, but four out of the
six laid their first summer. Later, some cocks having been procured,
a pair was sent to the London Zoological Gardens, where they bred
their first year, one young bird being reared to maturity. These
birds require abundance of green food in addition to such seeds as
canary and hemp and soft food such as barley-meal. Freshly cut
willow shoots are appreciated, and a plentiful supply of good grit is
most essential.
The Red Grouse (L. scoticus) is a local race of the Willow Grouse
that does not change to a white dress in winter. It occurs in Great
.Britain and Ireland only.
In 1912 Mr. H. Wormald kept four pairs of Red Grouse which he
described as the tamest and most interesting of all the game-birds
he had kept, and comparatively easy to cater for. All four hens made
nests and sat well, each on some ten eggs. A few of the eggs were
placed under a Bantam, which was fortunate, as all the sitting Grouse
were killed one night by a stoat. The Bantam hatched and reared
the young Grouse successfully.
The Ptarmigan (L . mutus) is found on the mountains of Scotland
and Europe generally. It is slightly smaller than the Red Grouse.
Its plumage is white in winter, the outer tail-feathers black, and a black
patch in front of the eye of the male only. In summer the male is
dark brown mottled with grey, with the underparts white, the
female being blacker with the underparts rufous buff. The Ptarmigan
has been rarely kept in captivity.
The Black Grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) has the tarsi feathered but

the toes naked. The outer tail-feathers of the male are curved out-
wards at the extremity.
The Black Grouse is an inhabitant of woods and forests of pine
and birch, and spends much of its time in the branches. It feeds on
berries, grain, and shoots.
Black Game are polygamous, and the gatherings of the males for
display and fighting in the breeding season have often been described.
They do not, as a rule, thrive for any length of time in captivity,
and the late Lord Lilford found that they did best when they had
the run of a large walled-in kitchen garden.
The Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). --This very fine species,
of which the male is some 3 feet in length, has its home in the pine
forests of Europe and Northern and Central Asia. It spends most
of its time in the branches of the pine-trees, feeding on the shoots of
spruce and larch. It also eats fruit and berries as well as grain.
Mr. St. Quintin found the Capercaillie a very difficult subject to
deal with in captivity, and the late Lord Lilford, with all his experience,
was unable to keep it.
The Hazel Grouse ( Tetrastes bonasia) inhabits Europe and Central
Asia, being found chiefly in hilly and wooded districts. In colour
it is greyish, barred with black. The male has the chin black, that of
the female being white. It is rarely kept in captivity.
The Prairie Grouse (Tympanuchus cupido), from North America,
is barred with rufous and black, and carries tufts of feathers on the
neck, those of the male being considerably longer than those of the
female. The cock bird has a loose patch of naked skin on each side
of the neck, which is orange in colour, and during display is inflated,
appearing like two oranges on the neck. It has seldom been kept in
captivity.
The Sharp-tailed Grouse ( Pediocaetes phasianellus). --Another
American species that has been represented in Zoological Gardens
of Europe.
The Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), also from the northern
parts of North America, has been imported.

Most aviculturists will look back upon the last year with mixed
feelings. It has certainly been the most extraordinary one in my
experience. In the spring and early part of the year we had frosts
of an exceptional severity, followed by many months of abnormal
dryness, with periods of very warm weather. This was followed by
one of the wettest autumns, accompanied by tremendous gales,
that I can remember.
The cold of the early months had the effect of delaying breeding
operations in the aviaries, and it also was the cause of numerous
infertile clutches, due to the weakness of the male birds when they
did go to nest. The dry and rainless summer, also proved disastrous
to those birds who rear their young for the first week or so mainly
on insect food, as insects of all kinds were very scarce. And to make
a bad season worse, the torrential rains of the autumn drowned
a large proportion of the young birds that were lucky enough to have
survived long enough to leave the nest. One never expects much
natural increase in one's aviaries, but I think that on 31st December
- last many of us must have had far fewer birds than when the season
opened. I hope that things may be better this year.
I have already given you the accounts of the rearing of the Chilian
Tinamou and the South African Water Rail, and nothing very much
else of interest happened here.
Early in the year my Cayenne Lapwings made several nests.
These were quite well made, of bits of stick and willow-bark, and
they were very conspicuous as they stood quite 2 inches above the
ground. Although no eggs were laid the birds became very quarrel-
some, suffering nothing to come near their breeding ground, and
driving away such large birds as Sacred and Scarlet Ibises. My
Mexican Scarlet Tanager duly nested, but the eggs were again
infertile. The Yellow-breasted Grosbeaks, although a true pair and
apparently in fine breeding condition, made no attempt to nest.
The Brown-headed Troupial again mated with a hen Bay Cowbird,
and reared one young. Olivaceous Thrushes failed to rear their

young ; the weather was too dry for them. My Chilian Thrush
nested three times, but unfortunately she had no husband. This is
a handsome bird about the size of our Fieldfare. A pair of American
Tree Sparrows, kindly sent me by my friend Professor Rowan, of
Alberta, made a neat little nest close to the ground, in a bundle of
sticks, and laid a clutch of eggs, pale green with small pink spots,
but unfortunately another bird raided the nest. Nesting as these
birds do in Alaska, the eggs are hard to obtain and are scarce in
collections.
My Tree Pies built a deep cup-shaped nest in a conifer, in which
the hen laid three clutches, all infertile. When the hen was sitting
the cock became very savage, and I always had to take a stick with
me when I entered the aviary. His favourite mode of attack was
to swoop at the back of your neck and scratch with his claws, but
if your eye was off him for a second, he would make a frontal attack
as well. They are very handsome birds, and I believe Dr. Amsler
bred them some time ago.
The five species of Lovebirds kept were also failures ; although
many eggs were laid, no young ones were hatched, the trouble being
dead young ones in shell. I am afraid that there is no chance of
any of these birds being established in our aviaries in the same way
that Budgerigars are. One of the troubles is the difficulty of sexing
some of the species. With the Water Birds we also had no luck.
The Yellow-billed Coots and the Blue Coots did nothing. Two or
three of the Reeves selected breeding-sites, but did not get as far as
eggs, and the Knots, although most of them came into full breeding
plumage, never looked like nesting. After trying for twelve years
I have given up hopes of getting eggs from these birds. It is to be
hoped that the coming season will be a normal one, at any rate as
far as weather conditions go.

By permission of The Lady Lilford I again send a few particulars
about the birds at Lilford. These, if somewhat late, refer to season
1929.
Firstly, like other aviculturists, we had to contend with an extra-
ordinarily severe winter, the severest portion of which was a certain
week in February, when we experienced over 240 hours of continuous
frost and a nightly temperature of from 20 to 30 degrees.
The one redeeming feature of this remarkable winter was its
dryness, an almost Arctic cold--a condition which without doubt,
upon our unkindly clay soil at Lilford, proved much less trying to
bird life than a lesser degree of cold combined with damp. This
contributed largely to our getting safely through the first four months
of the year without losing a single established bird.
During the severest weather our Waterfowl in one pond at least
were completely frozen out, and either slept upon the open ice or
around the edge of a moist, boggy patch fed by a tiny spring. The
Flamingoes, too, retired to this tree-shaded sanctuary, and either
* nosed about in this small patch of mud or stood within it upon one
leg. In this enclosure also Bed-billed Tree Duck wintered satis-
factorily. The more delicately Javan, White-faced, and some
unestablished Fulvous being driven into a shed at night.
Upon a more exposed piece of water some seventy Duck wintered
satisfactorily, keeping a small pool open in the centre by continually
swimming about. These included Comb Duck, Eider, Bosy-bill,
and various more hardy species.
A pair of Pelicans sharing the same water felt the cold a little,
and being sun-loving subjects showed great intelligence in invariably
roosting upon that portion of the pond's bank which received the
last rays of the setting sun.
An Apteryx or Kiwis (Apertryx haasti) being entirely dependent
upon earthworms for food might reasonably have been expected
to suffer during this prolonged cold, dry spell. This bird, however,
refused all artificial help in the shape of shredded meat, etc., and

A. F. Moody--Notes from the Lilford Aviaries
having the range of a large enclosure seemed to find sufficient
sustenance ; and, as usual, went to ground during the day-time
and hunted his enclosure at night.
Crested Cranes, Screamers, and other half-hardy birds wintered
satisfactorily when provided with the usual unheated shed protection.
Of Parrots, three Red and Yellow Macaws (Ara macao), except
for a period of three days when they were taken indoors for fear
of a snow blizzard, spent the winter at liberty.
These, in all their glory of unstained red, blue, and gold, when
seen flying in large circles or shooting forward at a lower elevation
amidst trees are extremely ornamental, and perhaps the most
spectacular of the various birds kept here. Their quaint and amusing
behaviour generally also render them great favourites and a source of
attraction to most visitors.
These Macaws rarely wander more than a mile or two from home,
invariably return morning and evening to be fed, and are ever ready
to come swooping down to the shoulder for food.
During cold weather they roost in dove-cote like barrels, during
the summer occasionally in trees.
As to such supposed natural habits as can be observed from
examples living under these conditions, it is noticeable that they
are excellent fliers and take a great amount of exercise, that they
occasionally create a shower bath by repeatedly flapping their wings
amidst the saturated foliage of trees, also that when the sun is hot
they keep out of sight and in the shade of trees ; further that at all
seasons they fly late and quite into twilight.
Regarding breeding. The hot and dry summer following the
prolonged winter (we registered from 16 to 18 degrees of frost as late as
18th April) did not appear conducive to great successes. Early in
the season a supposed pair of the Red and Yellow Macaws already
referred to raised our hopes by forcibly ejecting some Pigeons from
a dove-cote. This they jealously guarded for some weeks, but
nothing further resulted from it.

young were reared, as were also a pair of hybrid Jungle Fowl between
a male Gallus varius and a female Gallus gallus.
Our Canvas-backs did not lay, the best Ducks reared being three
North American Dusky Ducks ( Anas ohscura), one Abyssinian
Yellow-bill, and one female Scaup. These numbers, except in the
case of the Turkeys, represented the only fertile eggs laid by the
species named.
One young Japanese Crane was reared. An earlier brood of two,
owing probably to the absence of parental control, proved the subject
of a great tragedy. These two chicks, which were hatched under,
and intended to be reared with, the help of a Ehode Island Eed,
immediately they were transferred from the nest and while yet but
a few hours old, indulged in a set quarrel or wrestling match.
Ignoring for the time being the natural parents' habit of each
more or less taking charge of a chick ; the ridiculous efforts of these
youngsters to injure each other were not taken seriously, and they
soon became tolerant of each other or friends ; a condition which
lasted undisturbed until the fifty-second day (24th June), when
they suddenly restarted the quarrel, one bird killing the other out-
right and then itself dying from exhaustion. Both chicks at this
period were about the size of large farmyard cockerels and of course
out of all reasonable danger ; the irony of the unfortunate occurrence
being that repeatedly they had of necessity been left for long periods,
but on this occasion an assistant working the entire day in their
enclosure had left all as usual at noon and returning an hour later
found the mischief completed.
With aviaries and enclosures already stocked--several with
veterans of from twenty to forty years of age--we do not add many
birds, except perhaps Waterfowl.
The most interesting additions during the year are Seriamas,
Wild Muscovies, Javan Jungle Fowl, and an eighth species of Mallard
(Anas melleri) from Madagascar ; the most decorative a supposed
pair of the beautiful Hyacinthine Macaw ( Anodonhynchus
hyacinthinus) from Central Brazil.
The latter, since their arrival in May, have completely moulted
out, and as the result of gentle treatment and being left undisturbed,

In spite of the good summer we had, in 1929 the rearing results were
poor, although a good many species nested. The only new bird reared
was the White Capped Starling (Heteropsar albicajpillus ), which I
described in the August number of the Magazine.
Heuglins Bobin Chat (Cossypha heuylini ).--Built a nest in a
basket placed in the shelter, using moss and dried grass and lined with
very fine grass. Laid one egg on 2nd April which was addled.
Another egg was laid on 6th May. This was also addled.
Bronze-wing Pigeons (Phaps chalcoptera ).--Reared two young
which left the nest on 6th May. Later on, two more young were
successfully reared.
Superb Starlings (Spreo superbus ).--These birds were seen
feeding young on 28th April, two young fully reared leaving the nest
on 11th May. A third one was also reared later. Another pair hatched
out two young which died in the nest.
Blue-winged Siva (Siva cyanoptera ).--Built a lovely cup-shaped
nest in a box bush, using chiefly dried grass. In April the hen laid
one egg--pale blue with a few red spots at the larger end. This egg
disappeared. Two more eggs were laid on 23rd May, and these also
disappeared after being incubated for four days. I am afraid the
Sivas themselves were the culprits as no other birds in the aviary
could have done it.
Pied Grallina (Grallina picata ).--This old pair of birds repaired
last year's nest and in it laid two clutches of two eggs each time. Young
were hatched and I am afraid were devoured by their parents.
Chestnut-breasted Rock Thrush (Petrocincla erythrogastra ).--
Built a nest of moss and rough grass on a ledge inside the shelter. Three
young seen on 15th May, only one left the nest and this died on 6th June.

a domed-shaped nest in a basket in the shelter of the aviary. Three
eggs were laid. One young was seen hatching on 13th May and later
on three were seen in the nest. Only one left the nest on 8th June.
The parents were most attentive to the young one, and all three lived
happily together till about the middle of July when, one morning, I
found the young one had been killed by the parents who had gone to
nest again. They reared another fine healthy young one in August.
Had I known they intended to nest again so late in the season I would
have removed the first youngster and would thus have saved its life.
Japanese Robin ( Erithacus akahige). --On 8th June these birds
were seen feeding two young in a nest built in a box bush. One was
found dead on the 13th, and the other on the 15th. Both parents were
feeding the young well on fresh ants' eggs, grasshoppers and mealworms,
and I cannot make out why they were not reared.
Renauld's Ground Cuckoo (Carpococcyx renauldi). -- One pair
laid two eggs out in the open and did not incubate them. Another pair
laid two eggs in a clump of grass and sat on them well. Both eggs were
addled.
Tambourine Doves (Tympanistria tympanistria). -- Reared three
young.
Crowned Starling (Galeopsar salvadorii). --Hatched one egg and
the young one was thrown out of the nest.
Edward's Lorikeet (Trichoglossus hoematodes). -- Two eggswere laid
but broken during incubation.
White-breasted Pigeon (Gallicolumba jobiensis). --Reared two
young.
Eormosan Bamboo Partridge (Bambusicola sonorivox). -- Was
found sitting on eggs which were deserted after a week.

Madagascar Bustard Quail ( Turnix nigricollis). -- Laid three

Harlequin Quail (Coturnix delegorguei). --Laid several clutches
of eggs, but incubated none.
Swinhoe's Pheasant-tailed Pigeon (Macropygid swinhoei ).--\0x25A0
Several young reared. Only one in each clutch. These birds nest and
rear young successfully right through the winter.

Ever since Dr. Hamish Nicol's delightful account of " Orphans and
Maimed Birds " in the November Magazine I have been meaning
to write the story of a Sparrow, but the end and beginning of a year is
always a busy time for secretaries and treasurers, and the time has
flown by.
When we were children we lived in an old-fashioned village in
Essex, in an old-fashioned house, right in the main street ; in fact,
so much so that on market day there was danger that the animals
might walk in at the windows. At the back, however, there was a
lovely garden leading on to fields in which one could wander for miles
without crossing a road. An ideal place for children. One day my eldest
brother and I were sent to see an old lady a little way up the road.
On the way we passed an open gutter, out of which was proceeding
the most terrible chirruping. My brother put his hand up and pulled
out a half-fledged Sparrow. It looked a most forlorn little thing and
was evidently very hungry. We were not quite sure what to do with
it ; however, he finally put it in his pocket and we proceeded to call
on the old lady. I remember so well in the middle of our visit it gave
a loud chirrup, and I remember looking at the old lady to see if she had
heard, and then having an almost uncontrollable fit of giggles.
Fortunately for me my brother came to the rescue and thought it was
time we went. On getting home we put the Sparrow in a basket and
fed him with soaked bread on the end of a match. After a time he
learnt to take this himself, and then we added a seed mixture of canary
hemp and rape. How he survived our treatment I don't know, for
every morning he had a fit and spun round on his head at the bottom
of the cage, after which he got on his perch and seemed fairly happy
for the rest of the day. He lived in the window in our school-room
and on fine days was put out in a kind of loggia along with a Canary,
a Bullfinch, a squirrel, and a hedgehog, and any other pets that might
be going at the moment. He got very tame and learnt to sing like
the Canary, but in rather a harsh voice. I think we were all very fond
of him and he went by the name of " Spar We kept him through

the first summer and winter, but decided to let him go in the spring.
So we hung him outside and left his door always open. However,
Spar thought he knew better ; he knew where he was well fed and well
housed, and he decided he would not leave. So he lived all that summer
in his cage with the door open night and day. When the autumn
came we shut the door and brought him back into the school-room
for the winter. The next spring we tried again, opening the door and
leaving him entirely outside. This time he thought better of it, and
tried a flight on to the house top. But he soon came back to feed.
After that, however, he went away every day, coming back to feed,
and always slept in the cage. Then one day he brought a very timid
little wife who hopped all round the cage ; finally she, too, went in and
fed. After that she came every day. Then they built a nest in the
eaves of the house just above the kitchen window and hatched out
a family of, I think, five. When they were able to fly the parents
brought the whole lot to the cage to feed. This went on until about
August when we all went off to the seaside, and I don't know what
happened, but possibly the servants forgot to put food in the cage,
anyhow, we never saw the Spar or his family again. Perhaps they,
too, went off to the seaside for a change.

Lord Tavistock points out an unfortunate printers' error in the
last number of the Magazine, which credits him with condemning the
use of sunflower seed for parrots, whereas the word he actually wrote
was " safflower " seed. To make matters worse I commented on his
letter in these notes. However, it is now clear that we agree that sun-
flower is a very useful seed. As to safflower, I must admit that I know
very little about it, but presume it is one of those useless seeds which
are added to certain parrot mixtures to make bulk. I find by referring
to the encyclopaedia that its scientific name is Carthamus tinctorius,
and it belongs to the natural order Composite e. The plant is a native of

the East Indies and its flowers form the basis of the safflower dye of
commerce. As a food for Parrots it appears to be quite unsuitable.
The lake in St. James Park has for many years carried a. very
good collection of waterfowl and amongst these may now be seen a drake
and two ducks of the South African Shelduck, Casarca cana, which
arrived in October last, being sent as a present from the Public Works
Department of the Union of South Africa through the late Governor
General, the Earl of Athlone. The species somewhat resembles the
Buddy Shelduck, but is distinguished by the head and neck of the male
being dark ashy grey, while the female, which is somewhat smaller,
has the front of the face, a patch round the eye and the chin white.
In South Africa, the species which is known as the Berg-eend, is
confined to Cape Colony, the Orange Biver Colony, and the Transvaal,
and is considered a somewhat scarce species. It has been but rarely
imported into Europe, and in the whole history of the Zoological Society
only one has been exhibited in the Gardens.
It seems to be agreed that last summer was not a good one for
aviculturists. On the whole comparatively few young birds were reared
and this I think applied to wild birds as well as to those in captivity.
The very dry atmosphere was not congenial to insect life, a wet season
being more favourable. Pheasant breeders tell us that one curious effect
of the abnormally dry season was the production of a large
preponderance of cock birds.

of these birds and to express our opinion as to the development of
the changes which have occurred up to now.

green bird. The mutations came forth as follows :--*
1. The first one (a loss-mutation) was the change from green into
yellow. The same is said to have been observed in some cases in
wild birds, though there is no imported skin of a yellow bird on
file in the Museum of Natural History in London.
2. The next one (again a loss-mutation) was the appearance of a
blue variety, which occurred in captivity (Belgium).
3. A further variety came into existence by the darkening of the
light green colour into dark green, and subsequently into olive green
(it was a gain-mutation).
4. Again a loss-mutation is the change from normally green

undulated birds into those which were called #C apple green ", which
subsequently developed into their blueish cousins by name of
" Grey wings It is the latest one which has come to our knowledge.
Re No. 1.--This (yellow) mutation is a very old one. No exact
data about its origin seem to have been gathered nor opinions uttered,
at the time of its first appearance, as to the causes which have led to it.
It seems, however, pretty safe to assume that the step from green to
yellow has not been made in one performance. In order to achieve
this, nature would have had to eliminate almost entirely the two
factors for oxydase, which the green bird possesses, which is less
probable than the assumption that this operation has been performed
in two stages, the first one being the forming of a green-split yellow
bird. Such birds would transfer this (invisible) quality to 50 per cent
of their progeny and, if by chance two of such specimens paired
together, yellow young ones must have resulted. This may have
happened many generations after the appearance of the first green-
split yellow bird, and could have taken place as well in the wild
flock as in a breeder's aviary.
Re No. 2.--Here, likewise, the assumption seems acceptable
that two factors (FF) did not fall out at the same time, but that
the way may have led over a green/split blue bird, the quality of
which perhaps remained hidden for a long time, till it became evident
through a chance pairing of two such birds. It would not be
surprising if this had happened already in Australia, since the

countries of origin have also furnished a blue Ringneck and a blue
personata Lovebird.
Re No. 3.--Dark green Budgerigars are a variety of the light green
kind. They came into existence by a mutation of the bb (brown)
factor into a Bb one. It was only a question of time till out of two
Bb birds the BB (Olive) emerged. The mutation has occurred in
wild birds. A skin of a dark green Budgerigar has been in London,
in the Museum of Natural History, since 1847.
Re No. 4.---The Grey wing green birds (so-called " Apple Greens ")
are only about six years old, and it should not be difficult to collect
and sift the data about their appearance. Regarding the technical
development of this mutation we venture to suggest the explanation
that it can have originated with the green line only, and not with
the yellow one, as some breeders seem to believe. One of the oxydase
factors in the wild birds has a combined function, causing the green
colouring as well as the undulations. This factor seems to have
split up into several grades. The strongest one (the original) ensures
the normal appearance. The mutation decreases this effect to a
greyish one. It diminishes the generally distributed green colour
so as to allow the yellow basis of the F factor to become more
conspicuous and it influences also the wing marks. By transferring
this mutation to the white or blue kind of Budgerigars, the new
charming varieties of Greywing/light blue, or Grey wing/cobalt or
Greywing/mauve have been created, but they are no mutations.
Regarding the question of the white variety of Budgerigars,
we may add that the same is the result of a combination , and leaves
no room for assuming a real mutation. By pairing a blue to a yellow
bird, the type green/split blue-yellow-white had been created, and
it is evident that the crossing of the progeny must have led to a
splitting up into nine different kinds of colour birds, amongst which
are blue/whites, yellow/whites, and whites. If the two former have
appeared before the latter, and manifested their hidden qualities
by splitting off whites, this cannot be called a mutation, as it is merely
the natural result of planned or accidental pairing.
Neither the making of cobalt or mauve birds touches the dominion
of a mutation. After the scale of the green line had been constructed

by light green, dark green, and olive birds, it was again a clear case
of combination to transfer these shades of darkening upon the blue
line, the light (sky) blue corresponding to light green, the cobalt to
dark green, and the mauve to olive. The splitting up interse on both
sides takes place always in the same proportions, as we were able to
demonstrate by thousands of young birds of our own experiments.

THE LARGE-BILLED INDIAN WEAVER

Sir, --I noticed recently at the Zoo that the Large-billed Indian
Weaver (Ploceus megarkynckus) presented by Mrs. Holmes in the
summer of 1928 is still going strong. This individual has never gone
out of colour, nor did others in the consignment to which it belonged,
which were for a sufficient time in stock at Messrs. Gamage's. Yet
the bird undoubtedly has an undress. Hume described it in this
plumage, and two which the Indian Museum procured from Rutledge,
of Calcutta, and kept alive when I was on the staff, enabled me to
establish the validity of the species by going out of colour and into
undress plumage, when I found they were identical with Hume's
birds. In this dress it is browner and less streaky than the ordinary
Baya Weaver, and in full dress is distinguishable from other Asiatic
Weavers by being all yellow below from chin to tail, it is a large form,,
about as big as the African Rufous-necked Weaver. In the new edition
of the Fauna of India it is called Finn's Weaver, but in justice to Hume
this should not be done.

Another wonderful testimonial to
" STAMINA "
The Insectivorous Food Supreme.
Dear Sir, 37, Dean Road, Southampton.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.987892222222222" page_id="56211565"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Please send the usual amount of Stamina food. I feel I must express my satisfaction
in using this wonderful food. From personal experience and a thorough testing, of Stamina ,
I have every confidence in the general using of it in Budgerigar Breeding. When once accustomed
to this Food they take it very freely, and there is no doubt that it supplies just that little extra
which Budgies in confinement have been denied. When I supply my birds with this food, they
leave all other and chase each other from the feeders for it. &amp;apos;lhe young reared on it are a contrast
to others that are not. In the nest they developed much quicker and left the nest much stronger
and healthier. Stamina has also been given regularly throughout tire moult, and has had much to
do with their perfect condition, in which they have won awards at our leading Shows. My latest
success proves this. My wins at Bi istol were as follows. Olive Cocks, 1st and two Spls., White
Cook, 1st., Pair Greens 2nd. Golden Breasted Bunting 4th out of four entries. In view of the
thousands of Budgies still left in the need of this valuable food, I confidently recommend all
interested in this fascinating hobby to give it a trial. The results, I am sure, will amply repay.
Yours truly, E. J. BROWN.
The above testimonial from one of the largest and best known Budgerigar
Fanciers is, to say the least, convincing as to the value of Stamina for
rearing healthy stock. Original and hundreds of others open to inspection.

THE PURPLE-THROATED COTINGA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99849252631579" page_id="56211568"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
The family Cotingidse, of South America, contains a number of
fruit-eating birds, many of which are of most brilliant colours, while
the plainer-coloured species are of great interest. Among these latter
may be mentioned the Bell-birds and the extraordinary Umbrella Bird.
The Cotingas are a group in which the males are very brilliant in
colour, and it is somewhat remarkable that they are so very rarely
imported alive to Europe. Of the Purple-throated Cotinga (Cotinga
cayana) a pair, imported last August, were presented to the Zoological
Society by Mr. Spedan Lewis, and were the first of their kind to be
received by the Society and probably the first ever imported. The
male of this pair did not thrive from the first and only survived a
comparatively short time, the post mortem examination of its body
revealing the presence of mycosis. The female, however, appears
likely to do well
The Purple-throated Cotinga occurs in Guiana, Amazona, and
Eastern Ecuador, and, as can be seen from the accompanying illustra-
tion, the male is a particularly beautiful bird. Like most fruit-eating
species, it is not difficult to manage in captivity, and it seems a pity
that this and other species of the genus are not more often imported.

There is a strange sinister atmosphere about Dominica, which some
say is an evil spirit which broods over the island. But leaving native
superstitions aside, it is a strange fact that on this lovely island very
few seem to succeed, something happens, and in time the jungle swallows
up again the efforts made by man. After nearly three hundred years,
while most of the other West Indian Islands seem to prosper, this
island remains almost as wild and mysterious as ever. It is certainly
the wildest and the most impressive land I have ever seen, and its
grandeur and beauty will remain a life-long impression. Dominica
will ever seem as a dream, as one of those strange mysterious and lovely
lands which we see only in our dreaming hours, and I shall always feel
that there is nowhere else left to see, for in Dominica I have seen the
world's nearest approach to Paradise.
I lived in a remote part of the island for a time, about 8 miles from
my nearest white neighbour, and penetrated far into the great silent
forests, so that I had an unique opportunity of seeing parts of the
island which are denied to the ordinary traveller.
The number of indigenous species inhabiting the island, considering
its size and luxuriant vegetation, is comparatively small and contains
no species of great interest to the scientific ornithologist except the
two very rare and indigenous Parrots and the supposedly extinct
Capped Petrel ((Estrelata hcesitata). Several beautiful and interesting
species have, alas, been exterminated, including the beautiful Macaw
(Ara guadaloupensis). The lack of species is made up for by the large
numbers of each individual species, for birds are exceedingly abundant,
especially the smaller ones. The two Parrots are very rare, one
exceedingly so, and are in grave danger of extermination. It is a great

tragedy, as I have remarked before, that these two birds should be
sought after as food ; for, strange to say, there is no systematic
persecution of the other smaller birds, and I think that few, if any,
are killed except the Pigeons and Doves, and the smaller birds such as
the Humming-birds, Finches, etc., a,re looked upon with great favour
by both black and white.
Strange to say, there seem to be very few sea-birds around the
coast of Dominica ; I have never seen any beyond an occasional
Booby or Yellow-billed Tropic Bird fishing out at sea. These birds
look strangely unlike the other sea-birds with their long pointed tails
flowing behind and their beautiful plumage which shines like white
satin in the sun.
Most of my bird-watching was done in a beautiful valley surrounded
almost all round by towering cliffs covered with the most luxuriant
tropical vegetation ; giant tree ferns, slender palms, and huge forest
trees ; it looked like an enormous crater, which, of course, it wasn't.
There was an opening on to the seashore, but this was blocked up by a
barrage of tall mangrove trees and graceful coconut-palms, and here
and there through a rift in the foliage one could see the indescribable
blue of the Caribbean Sea.
The main part of this valley had been a lime plantation, but the
dread disease which has killed Dominica's principal industry had visited
it and killed all the trees. Needless to say, it had been abandoned, but
all the dead trees were now overgrown by tropical creepers, and every-
where rank vegetation had sprung up as it is wont to do on all cultivated
lands which have been abandoned. The place had evidently been
swampy, and had been elaborately drained by means of channels, but
these were now filled up with huge aquatic plants, and the whole
place was reverting to its original condition. Birds always seem to
flock to old cultivated lands, for, instead of a pure culture of certain
plants and trees as there often is in a wild state, there is an enormously
varied growth of vegetation, each particular growth trying to gain
ascendancy, and I believe this is conducive to an enormous amount of
insect life ; at all events, it was a birds' paradise, and nearly every
species, except the two rare Parrots, seemed to be there. Different
species of Herons and Kingfishers fished in the swamps, which were

also inhabited by Pipits and Sandpipers, while Warblers of dozens
of species simply swarmed in the undergrowth, especially the
exquisite little American Warblers, Dominica being one of then-
winter homes.
I spent many happy hours there with not a soul to disturb my
peace, the only sounds being the roar of the sea and the song of the
birds. What a lovely and quiet haven it was !
The Dominican Honey-Creeper (Ccereba dominicano ).--This
lovely little creature is exceedingly common on the island, and its short
harsh song is one of the best known bird sounds around the houses or
in the depths of the bush ; but the birds are not found in the forests,
which are singularly destitute of bird life except for the two indigenous
Parrots and a few Pigeons. It is remarkably tame and allows one to
approach within a few yards of it whilst it is trilling with gusto its not
very pleasant song. It is energy personified, and is continually on the
move, dashing from one tree to another, hardly seeming to have time
to feed or sing.
There is a species of tree in Dominica which has flowers like those
of the well-known " Bottle-brush 55 tree, but the flowers are white, and
have an exquisite scent like a mixture of orange-blossom and heliotrope,
and whenever one comes across one of these trees one is sure to see
at least half a dozen of these tiny birds feeding upon the honey-laden
blossoms. The bird takes hold of the flowers sideways (for they have
no petals, but are composed of tufts of snowy white stamens), and
sucks out the sweet juice. The birds are very business-like, and each
keeps to his own part of the tree, and when one trespasses there is
a sudden fracas and the intruder is driven away.
This creeper is called the " robin " by the natives, why, I do not
know, for a bird more unlike a Robin is hard to imagine ; it is more
like a Humming-bird, but possibly it is because it is so familiar.
I think that this bird must outnumber the other birds of the island
by two to one, excepting the Black-faced Grassfinch.
The males are terribly pugnacious, and when two meet they are
bound to fight. I have often nearly picked up two combatants which
have been locked together in each other's claws. In colour this tiny
mite is blue-black above and bright yellow below, and with very

conspicuous white eyebrow streaks. It feeds upon minute insects as
well as the nectar of flowers.
The Helmet-crested Humming-bird (Bellona exilis). -- Without
a doubt the gem of the avifauna of the island ; an exquisite creature,
looking like some brilliant iridescent emerald insect as it buzzes
from flower to flower in search of the tiny insects, etc., which are to
be found in most of the nectar-bearing blossoms.
I have never seen in any bird such a brilliant shining iridescent
green as this bird's crest is, in fact, it looks like a bright green flame
on the bird's head, and this is set off by the intense black colour of the
body feathers.
It is not lacking in intelligence, despite its diminutive size, for it is
the tiniest of the West Indian Humming-birds ; if it sees a stranger
it alights on a slender twig and shows the greatest interest in his where-
abouts, until another bird of the same species appears in the vicinity,
when a violent battle is at once commenced, in fact the movements
of the combatants are too rapid to be followed by the human eye.
No bird is more pugnacious than this tiny mite, he will attack birds
twenty times his own size, especially Hawks, and even a male and
female cannot meet without a slight difference of opinion. Like the
proverbial Irishman, if there is a row he will be there. I have noticed
the little hummers busily engaged around the flowers, when suddenly
they have heard the sound of a fight, and they have gone off in the
direction like the shot from a gun. Sometimes when two of the little
quarrelsome honey-creepers have been fighting, one of these Humming-
birds has appeared on the scene and at once dispersed the two
combatants.
In seeing and studying Humming-birds for the first time I
found that I have been under a delusion, firstly that they spent all
their time in the air buzzing from flower to flower, and secondly that
they can be approached and watched as they feed as easily as one
watches bees. Both ideas I found to be erroneous in regard to the
Humming-birds of Dominica. One usually sees them on a bush or on
a slender twig of a tree, where they sit sunning themselves or preening
their feathers, and the little Bellona exilis. like the others, spends much
of its time in searching the clusters of leaves for minute insects. I have

often seen them go over a whole tree making a most systematic and
careful search. One little fellow I used to see every evening on a special
branch of a lime-tree, where he sang his evensong, which sounded
more like the song of a cricket than that of a bird.
I think that this bird is the most marvellous living creature, a minute
atom of life not much larger than a bumble-bee, yet in every way as
perfect an organism as any living bird, and mo&amp;apos;re intelligent than
a good many.
I have seen these tiny creatures flitting about the flowers in a rain-
storm w r hich would have beaten many larger birds to the ground ;
perhaps these birds manage to avoid the drops !
Around my window grew a purple creeper, and every morning one
of these Hummers would come and, hanging on invisible wings, would
probe every tiny flower. Sometimes the bird would appear black, like
any ordinary humble-bee, then he would turn and the sun would throw
up the marvellous prismatic colours, until it appeared like some
brilliant glowing phosphorescent gem.
The female, who is even smaller than the male, is more of a brown
colour, and the crest is not so large or brilliant.
The Garnet-throated Humming-bird (Eulampis jugularis ).--This
is a large, but exceedingly beautiful Humming-bird, and around Roseau,
the tiny capital of the island, it is very common. Though at least
four times the size of the Crested Humming-bird described above, it
is often routed and put to flight by this tiny upstart.
I saw many of these Humming-birds in the botanical gardens,
where this species is particularly numerous. They are often to be seen
sunning themselves, sitting on some slender twig, moving first this
way and then that to get the rays of the sun on the whole of their
plumage. The iridescence of the bird&amp;apos;s plumage, when the rays of the
sun catch it, is indescribable. At first sight to a stranger this bird
appears to be black, and many people, strangers to the island, have
told me how disappointed they have been in the Humming-birds of
Dominica because they were black. When flying both this and the other
three species appear to be black, but when seen at close quarters it
can boast of few rivals in the avian world, even in this wonderful
family.

At one time the skins of this bird and the other Humming-birds
were in great demand in America, and the natives lost no time in
supplying the demand, with the consequence that no Humming-birds
were to be seen for a long time, but the exportation of the skins was
forbidden, and now they are almost as plentiful as ever.
I have always noticed that Humming-birds fold their wings below
the tail, and not above as other birds do. The food of this bird is
mainly insects.
Emerald-throated Humming-bird (Eulampis holosesiceus ).--
A most lovely creature of a glittering emerald green colour. It is about
intermediate in size between the other two ; it is also the plainest in
colour. It is the most familiar and the easiest to observe. One usually
sees it perched in some conspicuous spot, and from there it takes short
excursions to the nearest flowers, which it probes whilst hanging on
seemingly invisible wings. Sometimes, after a rain-storm, I have seen
it behaving like some mechanical toy, flying up and down with the
greatest rapidity above the bushes, apparently catching the tiny flies
which had taken shelter under the leaves.
The rain on the bird's plumage gives a most wonderful prismatic
effect, and the bird seems to glow with every known colour ; I have
noticed the same effect on the plumage of some of the sunbirds after
they have had a bath. There is a peculiar tuft of long white feathers
beneath each wing. I have only seen these tufts when the bird scratches
its head, the leg being brought up from behind the wing brings these
feathers out so that they fall over the wing ; doubtless they are
used in the display.
In the very heart of the great tropical forests whence I went in
search of the rare Dominican Parrots, where subdued green twilight
always reigned, we found this little gem. It appeared quite fearless,
and buzzed about searching the heads of the low tree-ferns and other
plants in search of insects. I saw it long after the twilight had fallen
when I could hardly tell whether it was a beetle or a bird. It seems
strange to see these tiny creatures here, for one usually associates
Humming-birds with tropical sunshine and gaudy flowers. In fact,
I have seen this bird feeding more upon the insects which it finds
among the leaves of the trees rather than by sipping the nectar of the

flowers. It seems to favour the mangrove-trees, and I have seen
individuals perched upon the leaves feeding upon some kind of tiny
insect or blight.
This tiny creature, like its congener, the Helmet-crested Humming-
bird, is not wanting in courage in spite of its size, for I have seen it
attack a Buzzard which was sitting preening itself in the sun. The
Buzzard took very little notice of the tiny creature which buzzed about
its head, for it evidently knew the futility of trying to catch such an
agile antagonist.
Bell's Humming-bird.-- Like the last bird, this very rare and
indigenous species is found only in the depths of the mountain forests.
When in search of the Imperial Parrot I was astonished to find this
bird buzzing about the low undergrowth in the semi-twilight in the
gloomy forest. It seemed like some tiny green wraith floating about
until some ray of sunshine which managed to penetrate the gloom
fell like a searchlight upon the bird and made it appear like a glowing
opal.
It seems to feed upon the tiny insects which it procures from the
heads and leaves of the plants which form the undergrowth in the
forests.
The Two-coloured Humming-bird (Cyanophaia hicolor). -- This
bird is rare, and I have seen it but few times. It is a fair-sized
Humming-bird, the under parts being jet black and the upper parts
the well known Humming-bird green, but the whole of the wing
coverts are an amazingly brilliant emerald green which flashes and
glistens in the sunlight.
The only times I have seen this bird have been at a tiny native
settlement called Calibishie, on the Atlantic coast, where I observed
it sucking nectar from the banana-flowers.
The Rufous-crowned Warbler (Dendroica ruficapitta ).--One
of the commonest and yet at the same time one of the most beautiful
of the Warblers to be found in Dominica. This tiny golden bird is
to be seen everywhere. One usually meets with them chasing each
other, not playfully, but in hot pursuit, and when the pursuer catches
his quarry there is a terrific fight, in which both birds fall to the ground
an animated ball of golden feathers.

This bird looks like a glorified Zosterops, for it has the same rotund
appearance ; its habits are almost identical. The embodiment of
perpetual motion, it spends all its time in search of minute insects
which constitute its main food. The general colour of this lovely bird
is bright golden yellow, the male having the top of the head a rich
golden orange.
American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). -- America is happy in
possessing a large number of exquisite Warblers, which differ from the
Warblers of the old world in being smaller and much more beautifully
coloured, red, pink, and yellow being the predominating colours. Of
the whole family, none is more lovely than the bird known as the
American Redstart, a bird which has no relationship to the birds known
as Redstarts in Europe, the American Redstart being a Warbler and
the European Redstart a Chat.
This little Warbler is to my mind not only the most beautiful of
the American Warblers, but the loveliest of all the known Warblers.
It is a migrant to Dominica during the winter months, though I
believe that a few stragglers remain all the year round. Its habits
resemble those of the other small Warblers. It is ever active in its
ceaseless search for small insects. I am sure that owing to the presence
of so many Warblers in the West Indies insect pests, with the exception
of mosquitos and sandflies, are conspicuous by their absence.
Perhaps I may be forgiven for quoting from The Booh of Birds ,
issued by the National Geographic Society of America concerning
this bird.
" Its beauty of form and plumage and its graceful motions place
this dainty bird at the head of our list of Wood Warblers--a place of
distinction indeed. The bird appears to be the incarnation of animated
motion and fairly dances its way through the forest.
" Spanish imagination has coined a suggestive and fitting name for
the Redstart, ' Candelita ' little torch-bearer.' The full appropriate-
ness of the name appears as the graceful creature flits through the
greenery, displaying the salmon-coloured body and the bright wing
and tail patches."
This delightful creature is clad in a combination of colours seldom
seen in a bird--a beautiful orange-salmon, yellow, red and brown, the

hen lacks the salmon shade, which is replaced by a dull yellow. It is
certainly one of the most attractive of the smaller birds to be seen in
Dominica.
When sailing several hundred miles off the coast of Florida quite a
few of these fragile wanderers came on board in a state of utter
exhaustion and starvation, it was pathetic to see them making a
desperate search for insects in all the nooks and crannies on the ship
with, of course, no avail. We caught several with the hope of saving
their lives, placing them in a cage in a warm room and feeding them on
cockroaches, but it was of no avail, they all died in a few hours.
The sea must take a terrible toll of these fragile mites and also
the other tiny American Warblers when migrating to their Northern
home. I have seen dozens of these tiny and exquisite creatures beaten
down by the rain as they vainly tried to reach a resting place on the
ship. To me it is the greatest of all mysteries how these tiny creatures
manage to cross thousands of miles of ocean and arrive safely at their
destination. I am sure that a good percentage must find a watery grave.
Black and White Warbler (Mniotilta varia). -- This is a bird
that would meet the most unobservant eye ; its plumage, though
boasting of no brilliant colours, is a very striking arrangement of black
and white. It is not a common bird, but unusually tame and confiding,
allowing one to watch it from a distance of a few feet. Its behaviour
reminds one of that of a Tree-creeper for it is wonderfully agile, running
up and down the branches and stems of dead trees searching the bark
for minute insects, or flitting from one clump of undergrowth to another,
disappearing for a minute or two only to reappear as it flies to the next
bush or tangle of undergrowth. It is not a resident of the West Indies,
but a migrant from Eastern North America.
Plumbeous Warbler (Dendroica plumbea). -- Slate-grey, lighter
above, the greater and lesser wing-coverts edged with white and a white-
eyebrow stripe, is the colour of this bird. It is another of the tiny and
dainty American Warblers, but unlike its brethren it boasts of no
striking colours. It is tame and confiding and seems to take no notice
of human beings, as it searches the undergrowth for insects. It is a
common bird in the island but, owing to its plain garb, goes unnoticed
by the crowd.

Dominican Kingbird or Tyrant (Tyrannus dominicensis). -- The
Tyrants, as we call them in England, are the most characteristic birds
of the West Indies, and usually the first birds to catch the eye of the
newcomer. The Dominican Tyrant invariably selects some very
conspicuous position such as the top of a dead tree or a telegraph pole,
and from there it makes regular short excursions after passing insects
upon which it feeds exclusively. They remind me more of Bee-eaters
in their habits than of any other birds I know, though these birds will
sometimes pick an insect from off the ground, whereas a Bee-eater will
never do this. These birds are extraordinarily tame, the reason being,
I suppose, that they meet with no persecution but are encouraged owing
to their insect-destroying propensities.
One bird I used to watch every day whose favourite perch was on
a telegraph wire about a yard away from my window, and from early
morning until night he remained there. I have watched the birds
catch young lizards, frogs and young land-crabs. These it would batter
for a considerable time on the branch of a tree, and even when they
appeared to be smashed to pulp the bird would have great difficulty
in swallowing them.
On a huge and venerable tree which was almost dead from old age,
but few leaves remaining on its rotting branches, and which stood
near the house, the birds held a morning concert and entertainment.
About a dozen or more birds would gather, and spreading themselves
about on the topmost branches, would begin. They would begin by
singing in chorus their by no means pleasant song, meanwhile opening
and closing their wings and tails with the same automatic motion as
that of those toy birds which are sold by street vendors in London.
Sometimes a tournament would take place, two birds rising high
in the air in a mock fight, the rest shrieking their approval of this
performance, and as soon as the two birds descended, two more would
start. This entertainment would last about an hour, during which
time the hubhub would be terrific, and after this they would leave,
one by one, to take up the duties of the day.
Ober's Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus oheri oberi ).--This bird
very much resembles the Dominican Tyrant. In the colour of its
plumage, size and habits, it has the same arrangement of colours, but

is very slightly smaller and paler, looking like a washed-out edition of
its larger cousin. It is not nearly so common as the other bird, and is
rather local and usually found in pairs. Despite its name, it appears to
me to be a true Tyrant.
Martinique Flycatcher (Elainia pagana martinica ).--This bird
is a true Flycatcher, but looks very much like a Warbler ; in fact its
habits seem to resemble those of a Warbler rather than those of a
Flycatcher. It seems to frequent the bushes and trees rather than take
up its stand in some conspicuous spot, as is the habit of the other
Flycatchers. At first sight it looks very much like a hen Chaffinch,
but it has a large loose crest of white feathers which is concealed when
in repose.
It is a very common bird, and is, I think, a resident of the island.
It is very tame, and has a lovely full sweet song, which it is fond of
uttering.
The Dominican Wren.-- The Wren of Dominica is a lovely little
creature whose confiding habits and extraordinary sweet song endear
it to all human beings. It is of a much more slender build than
the European Wren, but its habits are somewhat similar; it is
somewhat local and frequents the environs of the country houses,
where it builds its nest under the eaves or in some crack or cranny of
the house.
Sclater's or the Red-throated Finch (Loxigilla noctis sclateri).--
On nearly all the West Indian islands are found different sub-species
of this bird, and they differ but slightly from each other. It is an
exceedingly common bird in Dominica, but a little gem for all that.
It takes the same place there as the Sparrow at home. Tame and
confiding, it is found in every garden, and when encouraged, will
come into the houses. A friend of mine encouraged these charming
little birds to come into her house, but soon had reason to repent of
her action ; they hopped about the table pecking at the fruit and
spoiling it, bathed in the finger-bowls as soon as they were put on the
table, and became such a nuisance that they had to be excluded from
the house altogether.
The cock is jet black except for his bright red bib, but his mate is
a very sombre and inconspicuous little creature of a mouse-grey colour.

Sydney Portei--Notes on the Birds of Dominica 125
The male reminds me, more than any other bird I have seen, of a dull
edition of the Scarlet-chested Sunbird of Central Africa.
I quite fell in love with these charming birds and was sorely tempted
to bring some back to Europe, for I could quite easily have captured
some, but having five of the very rare Parrots from the island, which
were the main object of my visit, I felt that I couldn't be burdened with
more birds, especially as I had other countries to visit.
The nest, which is a very untidy structure, looking like a ball of
rubbish thrown into the tree, is composed mainly of strands of banana-
leaves. Often it is slung below the branch of an evergreen-tree, the
inside is, however, beautifully woven and lined with feathers and down,
and the entrance is quite concealed. The eggs are four to five in
number and are very like those of the European Hedge Sparrow, but
rather smaller in size, and perhaps a slightly paler blue.
In size and shape this bird is very much like a Bullfinch, but its
habits resemble those of a Sparrow in so much that it is usually found
around human habitations, feeding upon the crumbs or upon the tiny
seeds of weeds which it finds in the gardens. Its diet also includes small
insects. I don't think that this species has ever been imported into this
country, but it would be a very desirable acquisition to our aviaries.
Black-bellied Grass Finch or Quit (Tiaris bicolor omissa). -- A
near relation of the well-known Cuban Finch, a bird which it very
much resembles, except that it lacks the yellow markings which makes
it appear very dark, in fact, at a distance it seems almost black. It
shares with the last mentioned bird the honour of being the commonest
bird in the island. Around the native huts, farm buildings, and upon
nearly all cultivated ground, one is sure to see flocks of these little
creatures busily engaged in picking up minute seeds which form their
main food. One thing in Dominica that struck me as being rather
singular was that so many of the birds fed on flowers. These little
birds were frequently to be seen in company with the Honey Creepers
feeding upon the small flowers of various trees. This Grass Finch
always reminds me of a miniature Sparrow, which has been dipped in
soot, in fact, I think that they are rather ugly little birds. The hens,
though quite drab little birds in colouring, look much brighter and
cleaner.

Guadeloupe Grosbeak (Saltator guadelujpensis). -- This verv
striking looking bird, which is nearly as large as a Thrush, is usually
seen in pairs frequenting the abandoned lime plantations or around
the country houses. It reminds one of a large and sombre looking
Cardinal, being of a greyish colour below and a dark moss-green above,
with white markings. It is usually very quiet and unobtrusive,
slipping about in a kind of apologetic way as though it had no business
to be there at all. It seems to feed principally upon the leaves of certain
trees. I have frequently watched birds feeding for fifteen minutes or
so, stowing away enormous quantities of the leaves of a certain creeper.
I have also seen them feeding upon the large white unripe seeds of
cannas, which are as large as peas.
This Grosbeak has a very loud sweet song, very similar to that of a

Mr. Porter's article in the March number about the Quezal was very
interesting and I, too, have often wondered why this wonderful bird
was not more generally known in aviculture. In my opinion it is the
most beautiful and gorgeous of all known birds, even excelling the
Birds of Paradise, whose gorgeous feather ornamentation is so often
grotesque. The Quezal's flowing wing and tail coverts are more in
keeping with the harmony and grace of line of beautiful bird-form--
though the rich colours and extravagant plumage of the Birds of
Paradise often make one gasp at their beauty. I venture to correct
Mr. Porter's statement of the texture of the tail-plumes as being similar
to the plumes of the Great Bird of Paradise. I would say that they are
more like those outer half-barbed feathers on the Peacocks' train.
About two years ago we had as a guest at one of the meetings of
the Chicago Ornithological Society, a gentleman (whose name I
unfortunately do not now recall) who was doing Government work in
the Republic of Salvador. He spoke of the Quezal as being far from

uncommon there. Mr. Crandall, of the New York Zoological Society,
also tells of a man in Costa Rica who kept a pair of them for several
months in the patio of his home, and because they were so " dirty "
finally released them !
I do not think the Quezal would be difficult in aviculture if its
nature is at all like that of the Cuban Trogon, and I believe all Trogons
are similar in disposition. I have had a Cuban Trogon for three years
now, and it has always been in good health, and for the last year has
maintained its beautiful plumage. It is quite fearless, and can always
be depended on to " perform " for visitors (come to my fingers for
mealworms, of which it is exceedingly fond). I had at first what I am
sure was a true pair, for though exactly alike in appearance (most birds
of this family are quite different in sexual plumage) their voices were
noticeably different in pitch and they frequently called to one another.
The female had a higher-pitched voice and only lived a year, and for
a long time after the male never uttered a note. A third bird received
at the same time was sick on arrival, but lingered on for several months.
All three of these birds were in very rough plumage on arrival. Ever
since I have been trying to get a mate for my bird, but no more have
been imported. I think that it would not be difficult to breed them as
they seem quite oblivious to other birds, and shortly before the female

A few notes concerning my aviaries may be of interest to some
readers, so I send them with apologies.
I have bred Shanahs two years running, and I find the best method
is to put the cock and hen together in May in an outdoor aviary.
During the winter I keep them separate, but always in cages adjoining,
so that they can see each other ; in this way I find one is not so troubled
by their fighting. When they are paired and the hen goes to nest,
and about two or three days before the eggs are due to hatch, I open
the outside door of the aviary and let them loose in the garden, always

being careful to feed inside the aviary, and shut them up at night
for fear of Owls and stray cats. This I find not only very advantageous,
as they find so much live food themselves for the young, but also they
are most attractive flying about from bush to bush and shooting up
their tails on any branch or the lawn when they alight. They are quite
capable of taking care of themselves against any other birds, and
always drive the Thrushes or Blackbirds away from anywhere near the
aviary. They also get very tame when at liberty and will fly after me
wherever I go, hoping for a mealworm or leather] acket, and have no
fear of human beings. Before I let them out I found it extremely difficult
to rear any young ; after a few days they would throw the young ones
out of the nest and, of course, kill them ; but after I let them out I
had no trouble in that direction. It is most amusing to watch them
flying into the eaves of the house and catching spiders, blue-bottles
or any stray moth, etc. I regret to say I lost my old hen in the autumn
through moulting, and I fear old age. I certainly had her for years.
I have now got a new hen, and am hoping to have good luck with her
this year.
In my birdroom at the present moment (the 24th March) I have a
pair of Blossom-head Parrakeets nesting in a cage 3 ft. 6 in. by 18 in.
and 3 ft. high. I noticed in February the cock feeding the hen, and
saw she wished to go to nest, so I put in a box, with a round hole at one
end, and put some sawdust in it; she immediately took possession.
I have a small door at one end, whereby I can look into the box. I
did so on the 22nd March, when she was off feeding, and found she had
laid two eggs ; since then I have not disturbed her again, and shall
simply have to wait until I hear sounds of young birds. Surely this is
somewhat unique for Blossom-heads to nest in a cage. My birds were
frightfully wild, and used to fly about the cage the moment one
approached, but after they began to nest they have settled down in a
marvellous manner, and now never have any fear of any human being,
taking even no notice of my Hawkhead Parrot, who has never been
caged since I had him, and flies all over the Park or wherever he likes,
always returning to the birdroom in the afternoon for food, and
roosting on the top of the Blossom-head's cage. My Hawkhead is a
delightful person, and full of character. One afternoon about 4 p.m.

I watched him go for a small Owl who was sitting on a barn near by.
The Hawkhead flew on to the barn, threw up his crest, and the little
Owl flew off in terror. I should like to say I had great trouble in
procuring a hen Blossom-head, as they are hardly ever imported, as a
rule only cocks arriving. This one I got through the kindness of
Mr. Ezra, who was able to get one for me, and I am extremely grateful
to him. .

Members of the Society will, on 31st May, have an opportunity of
seeing the wonderful collection of foreign birds at Foxwarren Park.
It has never been so complete as it is at present, containing as it does
an almost endless number of rarities. There are several birds brought
by M. Delacour from Indo- China which have never before been seen
alive in Europe. The new Parrakeet aviaries are also very well worth
Inspection and the inmates are mostly breeding.
An interesting experiment that is being tried by Mr. Ezra consists
of the liberation of Cattle Egrets. &amp;apos; These were at first kept in one of the
aviaries and, as I write, three or four have been liberated but have not
gone away. It is intended to let out others in the hope of establishing
a breeding colony at liberty.
The new Parrot House at the Zoo is now stocked and open to the
public, and amongst the rarities to be seen are a Duyvenbode's Lory,
a Racquet-tailed Parrot, and an example of the rare Geoffroy us
cyanicollis, all in perfect plumage.
We must heartily congratulate Mr. A. H. Isenberg of Menlo Park,
California, on his successful breeding of Donaldson's Touraco described
in Aviculture for April, 1930. Mr. Isenberg appears to possess some
beautiful aviaries, and he is fortunate in living in a climate very

favourable to the keeping and breeding of foreign birds. The nest was
built in a living poplar-tree at about nine feet from the ground. Four
young appear to have been reared from three nests, the normal clutch
of eggs being two. The young birds " began eating by themselves
when only a few days out of the nest. It took about ten weeks before
they began looking like their parents, up to which time they were a
very dark grey, their heads and necks covered with dark fuzz, their
bills were nearly black at first, gradually changing to red."
Mr. Isenberg tells us that the Touracos during the breeding season
were very troublesome in the aviary, ruthlessly attacking the other
inmates. While feeding the young they ate hard-boiled egg readily
and were often seen on the lawn searching for worms, but otherwise
had only fruits and berries, being specially fond of grapes.
Donaldson's Touraco was described by Sharpe in 1895 from
specimens collected by Dr. Donaldson Smith as Turacus donaldsoni,
but it is now known to be a sub-species of T. leucotis, so that its correct
name is Turacus leucotis donaldsoni, or Donaldson Smith's White-eared
Touraco.
It is noticeable that most of the writers in Aviculture who have
succeeded in breeding birds to any extent reside in California where the
climate is ideal for aviculture and it is very satisfactory to find how
enthusiastically it is being taken up there. Aviculture seems to be
prospering to a certain extent in Australia also, and I feel sure that in
these countries it would be possible to save species of birds that are
threatened with extinction by breeding them in captivity.

down amicably, but the cock with the crooked toe was so henpecked
and terrorized that the hens were changed over in the hope of securing
him a less harried existence. But again pair No. 1 proved friendly,
or at any rate indifferent to each other, and hen No. 2 persecuted the
cock so savagely that to save his life he was taken away and passed
the winter by himself.
Another attempt was made this spring ; the unattached hen who
was being bullied by pair No. 1 was kept for some days side by side
with the single cock, who, I may say, showed all the signs of wanting
a mate. As long as the partition was between them they seemed
friendly, but as soon as they came together the hen turned so viciously
on him that she would certainly have killed him if they had not been
parted. As before, he fled terrified without making the least attempt
to defend himself although he is a fine well-developed bird and boasts
a good pair of spurs.
Can you or your readers explain this curious state of things ?

AN EARLY BLACKCAP AND A LATE BRAMBLING

<bodyText confidence="0.972964933333333" page_id="56211586"  page_num="131" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I had a good view of a fine Cock Blackcap on the morning
of 3rd April. The weather was dull and cold, and he was silent. Usually
one hears this species before seeing it--either a fragment of song or
a harsh alarm note. It is the earliest date I have recorded in this part
of the country, and my observations cover a number of years.
On the 5th of April, while watching a Lesser Spotted Woodpecker--
an unusual visitor to our garden--a small group of Chaffinches flew
up from some low ground a considerable distance away. One of them
appeared to have an unusually dark head and on closer investigation
it proved to be a Cock Brambling. The distinctive white patch above
the tail was plainly noticeable when it flew off. One can by this means
distinguish them from Chaffinches at quite a long distance. I do not
remember having seen one so late as this before.

A RING-NECKED PARRAKEET AT LIBERTY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.943286970588235" page_id="56211587"  page_num="132" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Eor the last six weeks--that is, since the beginning of
February--there has been frequenting our garden and the neighbouring
ones a cock Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet, obviously one of those
turned loose by some foolish but callous individual during the psittacosis
scare. Fortunately, belonging to a hardy species, he has managed to
get a living all through the bad weather--in fact, he looks in very
good trim. He occasionally comes on the top of the aviaries, but never
makes any attempt to get in or seems at all anxious about the seed
which he can see inside, and so far he has taken none offered.
One of his favourite trees now is a very large Prunus pissardi
(purple-leaved plum) which within the next few days will be a sheet
of white blossoms. In the morning sunlight he looks very beautiful,
swinging himself about in the upper twiggy branches, hanging upside
down with open wings. But the destruction ! Buds and small twigs
falling everywhere.
To-day his name is " Mud " with the gardener. Large groups of
polyanthus growing in the grass in the orchard have been stripped of
their blossoms. " Sparrows," said I, when shown them. " No," said
my man, " they have been ' cottoned ' for weeks, and not a Sparrow
has touched them so far."
The Ring-neck had been seen walking in the grass not many yards
away, but nobody saw him touch the plants--so he is not proved guilty
yet. But I am afraid he is the culprit.
After seeing the damage this bird can do--I have not mentioned the
colossal number of buds of plum and pear taken from his two favourite
trees. I wonder how the fruit-trees fare on the estates of those
aviculturists who have a number of birds at liberty. But, of course, all
Parrakeets are not so destructive as Ring-necks or Alexandrines.

with her second egg some weeks ago. Last week, in much colder weather,
she started to lay again. I had given her three drops of the Cimicefuga
Racemosa from the moment I saw r the cock carrying feathers about.
She laid five eggs -without any trouble. We had deep snow three nights,
and once I noticed the thermometer dropped in the night from 50 to
40 degrees. I am now trying it for a hen Cordon Bleu, who is very ill
with every egg, and I have to keep a fire going all night and really
nurse her. She lays soft eggs. I have tried grit and mortar rubble, and
soil and iodine, but I cannot get her right. Each egg takes 24 hours to
come. Can any member suggest anything at all that I can do ? She is
tame, and hops into the hospital cage quite happily, and as soon as the
bad time is over is well and happy again, and sings and calls for her
mate.

PAINTED QUAIL AND BUSTARD QUAIL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9717988" page_id="56211588"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- In your notes on last summer you remark that the dry
atmosphere was not congenial to insect life, and that Pheasant-breeders
report a large preponderance of cock birds. I fancy that there is a
relation between the two facts. During the years 1926-8 I reared
twenty-two Quail in my aviaries, only one out of all those was a hen.
When thinking it over I fancied it might have been caused through
my not giving the parents any live insect food until the eggs were
hatched. Years ago I had a pair of Chinese Painted Quail, which
I largely fed on mealworms and killed all their chicks except two before
I found out my mistake ; those two were hens. The only Quail-like
birds which hatched out last year were Turnix ypugnax. I had given
them a few mealworms daily all through the winter, until I could get
ants' eggs and gentles ; during the summer the cock was so wild that
he would not incubate properly. In despair I put the pair in quite a
small aviary, hoping that they would be tame enough another year.
Then one day in October I discovered two half-grown chicks, both
these are hens.
The above results may be onfy a chance. I should like to know&amp;apos;
what other members think.

Sir, --I have a pair of Hanging Parrots which I don't find described
in Lord Tavistock's book. The male is about 6 inches in length, and
has the throat and forehead red. The top of the head is orange-tan,
abruptly terminated on the nape with a narrow band of red. The upper
back is tinged with golden. The female is considerably smaller, and I
am not at all sure that she is of the same species. She has the red
forehead, but the red on throat of the cock is replaced by a similar
large patch of paler green. Her cheeks are blue.
My Spix Macaw is becoming more lovable every day--talks quite
a bit, but not always distinctly in a feminine voice, and frequently
bursts into song--in a laughably quavering manner. It is very tame
and can be trusted to remain on its perch unchained. The perch has
an addition of a branch about 2 feet high.
Among new arrivals in the aviary are perfect specimens of the
Golden Tanager (T. arthusi), Philippine Button Quail, which are very
tame, Blue Solitaire, which started to sing the day after arrival, and a
splendid pair of Western Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana occidentals).
These differ from Sialia sialia sialis by having all the throat blue and
a small patch of chestnut on the back. I hope to breed them.
My collection includes from one to four each of the following birds,
all living in harmony together, excepting the Macaw and Parrakeets,
which, of course, are kept separately. My oldest bird is a female
Liothrix, which I have had over eleven years. I have just lost my

Sir, --I feel I must write and thank Dr. H. Duncker and Consul-
General Cremer for their extremely interesting letter on the above
subject. I was rather afraid that the first mutations having taken
place so long ago, it would be difficult to get any record of them, but
the very excellent account of what must have happened given by these
gentlemen makes up for it. As to future colours, I foresee there may be
difficulty in obtaining accurate information. Anyone producing a
new colour would most likely be inclined to keep the means by which it
was obtained a secret. This may be small-minded and selfish, but it is
human nature. I wonder if it would be asking too much of such people
to write out a detailed account of such experiments as led to the new
colour, place it in a sealed envelope, write on the outside that it may
be opened on a date so many years hence, and hand it to the Secretary
of the Avicultural Society.
F. Lort-Phillips, Major .
Sir, --Referring to Major Lort-Phillips' letter in the February
Magazine, a few notes I have may not be out of place.
Re Apple-greens, the first was bred by Mrs. Ransom, of Wimbledon
Park, in 1920, she called it a Jade (see my article in Bird Notes, 1920,
page 152). She got some Blue-breds from me, and paired a hen to what
she called a Bad Yellow, and bred the bird mentioned above. When
I sent the description of it to the late Mrs. Dalton-Burgess she was
very anxious to breed some, so I sent her the sister of Mrs. Ransom's
hen and a Blue-tailed Yellow cock from a strain of Blue-tailed I had
at the time.
The following season both Mrs. Ransom and Mrs. Dalton-Burgess
bred some very nice birds of the new colour. Mrs. Ransom gave up

keeping birds, and Mrs. Dalton-Burgess and I got all her Jades and
Jade-bred ; they very soon bred true to colour.
Mrs. Dalton-Burgess did not think the name " Jade " was suitable,
so we decided to call them " Apple-greens
Re Blues in Great Britain, I think Mr. Pelham-Sutton was the first
to breed Blues from a pair of Blues, and left the lag on 31st December,
1912. Mr. Pulsford, of Paignton, appears to have been the first to
breed Blues from a pair of Blue-bred Greens, 9th February, 1914.
The origin of the Blue is unknown, and it is no good guessing at it,
but the Kev. J. M. Paterson came very near producing them by selection
and semi-dark aviaries (see article by him in Bird Notes , page 216,
vol. 1912), but I believe he left this country and parted with his birds
before complete success. I was the first to produce them from a Blue-
bred Green hen and selected Common Green cocks.
In 1914 I got a Green hen from Mr. Pulsford (I have her pedigree).
She was f blue, f green, J yellow. From her, paired to a selected
Common Green cock, T bred one Green hen only.
In 1915, from the Pulsford hen and another selected Common Green
cock, I bred four Green cocks.
In 1916 I selected one of these cocks and paired him to his half-
sister (the hen bred 1914) ; they produced two Blues and one Green.
Before this the only Blue I had seen was the cock of the first pair given
to the Zoo by M. Pauwel.
I may mention that my Blues were much darker than the one
at the Zoo, but they were pure Blue and pure White.
Re Whites, I think Mr. Astley or Mr. Hebb was the first to breed
a White. Mr. Astley's was bred in an aviary containing Blues, Yellows,
and Greens, so the pedigree will never be known. I think Mr. Hebb's
bird was bred from two Blues. Mr. Bradshaw bred the third White
from a pair of Blue-bred Greens he got from me (see Cage Birds ,

Mrs. Dalton-Burgess bred the first Mauves from the first Cobalts
that came into England, and Madame Lecallier bred them in France
about the same time and in the same manner.

<bodyText confidence="0.945140875" page_id="56211592"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I have just had an amusing proof that the propensity for
mimicry in Parrots is not confined to vocal expression. As my aviaries
are being taken down for removal there is much hammering on wood,
wire, and corrugated iron constantly going on, as the carpenters engage
in their work. These dulcet sounds my old Grey obviously considers
to be worthy of reproduction, but as they are beyond the compass of
her voice, extensive though it be, she has to resort to instrumental
methods to obtain the desired result. On going up to her aviary the
other morning, I was surprised to hear the typical sounds of carpentering
proceeding therefrom, though no human agent was in view. Looking
inside, I saw the Parrot with her head bent right over, giving her perch
five or six hard taps with the culmen of her beak, and then turning to
one side and repeating the action on the wire and iron to produce the
necessary variation in sound. The time and rhythm were perfect in
each case !

THE QUEZAL AND CAPE SUGAR-BIRD
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98848675" page_id="56211592"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Mr. Porter's timely and interesting article on the Quezal,
the only sensational species of the larger birds that has not been
imported alive, reminds me to record the importation alive of one of
the few sensational small birds. This is the Cape Sugar-bird (Promerops
cafer), a species resembling a Bulbul in size and colouring--brown with
yellow patch under tail, with the bill of a Sunbird and the long flowing
tail of the Giant Whydah (Coliuspasser proone). Before the w&amp;apos;ar I saw
a fine specimen of this striking nectar-feeding bird in the care of
Mr. W. Frost, who was keeping it for some one, as I understood ; it
was never exhibited, so far as I know.
With regard to the threatened extermination of the Quezal, I
should like to draw attention to the fact that, according to an article
in La Nature in January, 1928 (I think), a similar fate menaces the
Kagu, and a far more certain one, as it is flightless or nearly so.
Neglected dogs preying for themselves are the cause.

Sir, --The Snowy Owls, about which I wrote in the Avicultural
Magazine in 1929, p. 18, have been showing further changes. The big
bird that I take to be the hen is now all white on the head and neck,
except for a band of spots across the forehead, but she retains full
markings elsewhere. The white bird appears to be going back a bit;
he always had a few markings at the end of his wings, and now, I think,
he has more. The other two, which are not now in the collection,
were much alike as I last remember them--nearly all white, but still
showing many small markings in places ; so one had speeded up in
his progress towards whiteness. It is evident that the method and speed
of the assumption of whiteness in this Owl varies with the individual,
in males at any rate.

PHEASANTS

<bodyText confidence="0.994912055555556" page_id="56211593"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
Sir, --All Pheasant fanciers must have been deeply interested in
Mr. Van Heyst's letter in the March issue of our Magazine, detailing
the results of his Pheasant breeding during recent years.
In my opinion articles and letters dealing with Pheasants are all
too few and far between, but possibly the average Pheasant fancier
is so. absorbed in his hobby as to forget that others also
who are interested would like an occasional article or at least a letter.
I may be prejudiced, but can there be a more fascinating and
intriguing hobby than breeding and rearing fancy Pheasants of various
breeds. The rearing of such well-known breeds as Silvers, Goldens.
Amhersts, and Reeves is comparatively easy, but when one tackles
rearing such breeds as the Bornean Fireback, Impeyan, Peacock
Pheasant and the Elliot then one indeed is faced with problems,
perplexities and anxieties w 7 hich however only serve to enhance such
successes as we achieve. What an absorbing hobby it is. I am quite
certain that many aviculturists, who now specialize only in such small
birds as Budgerigars, Finches, etc., would soon become so engrossed
in their Pheasants as possibly even to neglect their smaller pets. For

apart altogether from their wonderful and majestic beauty--I use the
word majestic without hesitation--it is so entertaining to study the
eccentricities of the young birds. Their habits are so entirely dis-
similar, for instance one finds the Impeyan chick cheekily bold, very
tame and always busily digging with his upper mandible for grubs
and worms, whereas the Elliot chick one finds extraordinarily shy,
wary and apparently never ready for artificial food. And then the
final wonder when one watches the growing male bird gradually
assuming his gorgeous plumage, some in the first year, others in the
second. Does one experience the same variety of interests in breeding
smaller birds ?
I commenced writing this letter with the firm determination to
deal only with Mr. Van Heyst's breeding results, but, as usual, when
I commence writing of Pheasants my pen runs away with my good
resolutions.
One cannot help being struck with the varied success Mr. Van
Heyst has had. The fertility of the eggs has been uniformly good with
the exception of his Crossoptilons in 1928. It would be interesting
to learn from Mr. Van Heyst whether he discovered the cause for so
many infertile eggs in that year. Are one year birds infertile ?
Why is it Tragopans are so very difficult to breed ? I note his hen
Satyr in 1928 laid 11 eggs, not one of which was fertile. This strikes
me as amazing for I have found the Tragopan by no means delicate,
in fact the very opposite. One can readily understand the eggs of the
Bornean Fireback being infertile as of course&amp;apos;their native habitat is
very hot and humid, but last year I incubated 15 eggs of this breed
of which 14 were fertile and 12 hatched.
Mr. Van Heyst's hatching was quite good with the exception of
Horsfields. I note he reared two Impeyans out of 9 chicks hatched.
I hatched 13 chicks out of 14 eggs, but I will draw a discreet veil
over my rearing results.
Mr. Van Heyst is to be congratulated on his very successful rearing
of Crossoptilons and Swinhoes. Of these two breeds he reared 51 out
of 55 hatched. This is really remarkable and great credit is due
to him.
In conclusion may I thank Mr. Van Heyst for his most helpful

will take the hint.
Mr. George Beever occasionally gives ns an only too short but
always interesting article on fancy Pheasants, so perhaps he will
oblige us once more. I could also mention a lady who could write
us a most illuminating article, perhaps this lady will soon do so.

<bodyText confidence="0.8963438" page_id="56211595"  page_num="140" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In his interesting article on the breeding of the Sarus Crane
Lord Rothschild says that he has been unable to find any record of
complete success with this species during the past hundred years.
Apparently the Woburn records have been overlooked. The Sarus
was first bred there some time prior to 1908 and the A.S. Medal was
awarded for the event. Writing on the Cranes at Woburn, the Duchess
of Bedford says (Avicultural Magazine, 1920, p. 167) " For many
years previous to the war these Cranes nested and often reared their
young."

mixture, and has unique conditioning and feeding properties. My Shamas get nothing
excepting this Food and a few Mealworms daily, and they are very busy building just now.
I am positive it is mainly due to the use of this Food that I have such good results in
breeding Foreign Finches. All these birds relish this food, and feed their young on it, and
my success in this interesting branch of aviculture is well enough known to be convincing.
This Food, I am sure, has a great future in all branches of Aviculture.
Wishing you every success.

The name Plantain-eater is applied to certain of the Touracos,
amongst which are the two species of the genus Musophaga which are
distinguished by the upper part of the bill being swollen and forming
a horny sheath which extends on to the forehead.
The subject of the present note and of the accompanying plate,
M. violacea, occurs in West Africa from Senegambia to the Cameroons,
the other species, M. rossce, occurring in Angola and Equatorial
Africa. Ross' Plantain-eater or Touraco was figured and described
in this journal in December, 1910.
The accompanying plate gives a very good idea of the Violaceous
Plantain-eater, which is one of the most&amp;apos; beautiful of birds and a
thoroughly desirable subject for aviculture. The red cap on the head
\0x25A0consists of upstanding short feathers, and has the appearance of velvet.
In Ross' Plantain-eater these feathers are much longer and form an
upstanding crest.
In one of the outside aviaries of the Zoo Bird House, a pair of
M. violacea disport themselves, and are generally regarded as the most
beautiful birds in the whole collection. They have the red flight-
feathers common to the majority of the Touracos and these present

a quite vivid spectacle as the bird flies and the sunlight is seen through
them. They are birds of the forests, rarely coming to the ground,
and feeding upon fruit and, probably to a certain extent, young green
leaves. Also they probably eat insects and nestling birds in the
wild state.

IN SEARCH OF RARE CHINESE BIRDS
By Alex Hampe

Detesting the idea of being counted amongst the black sheep
which Lord Tavistock mentions in his article of the February number
of our Magazine, I hope the following lines about my experience in
trying to get rare Chinese birds and to send them to Europe will be
of interest to the reader.
My first venture in this line was the Derbyan Parrakeet. Having
read how very rare this Parrakeet is in Europe I went to the native
city and tried to find some of them. I had many times seen them there
in the bird shops, but as is often the case just when one particularly
wants something it is hard to get it. After a few weeks' search I could
only find three single cocks which had been in private possession and.
of these a friend of mine acquired two, whilst I procured the remaining
one and we finally landed them safely in England. But what I wanted
were breeding pairs in the hope of reading later on an account of the
breeding of this species in our Magazine.
Consulting my special bird dealer, he told me that on account of the
political disturbances in the Yangtze valley none would come any
more to Shanghai, but finally he agreed to send a man to Chungking
in Szechuan and bring me ten pairs.
After being paid a considerable sum of money in advance my man
departed. I waited patiently for two months, only to be disappointed
by the reappearance of my man absolutely empty-handed. He had
gone as far as Ichang and there met a lot of Chinese soldiers who treated
him very badly and took his money from him, so he got very frightened

and returned to Shanghai. Well, my money was gone and I was still
without the Parrots.
I now wrote to a friend residing in Chungking and sent him a
coloured plate of the Derbyan, asking him to kindly procure me some
of these Parrots. After seven weeks I got a letter informing me that
no Parrots were to be had in Chungking, that my request had, however,
been passed on to a foreigner in Chengtu. Five weeks later I received
further information that the gentleman in Chengtu had sent a catcher
further inland who had succeeded in catching forty-three and bringing
twenty-one safely to Chengtu. The others, much to my sorrow, had
died when transporting them over the high mountain-passes. Patiently
I waited for another five weeks, when to my intense joy my friend
wrote me that six pairs were on the way to Shanghai, the others he had
sold to Chinese in Chungking, as he thought that I did not want so many
of these " noisemakers " as he called them. This was the end of
February. March and April passed, but no Derbyan appeared, and
I gave up hope of seeing them in Shanghai. Then on a very hot,
sultry day in May, when I had just comfortably sat down in my softest
easy chair after a copious race-tiffin, I heard a knock at my door.
Rather annoyed on account of the disturbance, I opened, and to my
great surprise found a Chinese sailor with four most miserable looking
Derbyans. Each bird was fastened to the usual iron perch, and they
were all as thin as threads. The sailor told me that the little steamer
had run on a sandbank in the Yangtze, that they had a long delay on
account of this accident, and that he finally proceeded by another
steamer from Hankow. Now I had the Parrots, but in what condition ?
Forgotten was my afternoon's rest. In no time I was in the Chinese
city; bought cages, hemp and sunflower seed, and installed each
Parrot in a separate cage. They at once started to eat hemp and
sunflower seed greedily, and, as they were so very much run down, I left
the electric light burning during the night for the next week, so that
they could have a meal during night-times. During the next few weeks
they greatly improved and very soon did let me know that they felt
better by making a great deal of noise. When one started all the
others fell in, and that very often at 5 o'clock in the morning.
Knowing only too well what a bad passage one may encounter

during July-August in the Indian Ocean, I intended to ship my birds
at the beginning of September, but very soon my neighbours com-
plained and, although I tried to pacify them, telling them that the birds
were so rare and that their sing-song was really not so bad, I was soon
politely informed by the manager of the hotel that either the birds
or myself with the birds would have to go. So I ordered a cage and
shipped my Derbyans on a very hot day in July.
Great was my joy when, after about two months, I received a letter
from Mr. Seth-Smith informing me that all my Derbyans had arrived
in good condition and had already found good homes. I am sorry to
say so far none have bred, but I sincerely hope that next autumn we
will read an account of the Derbyan having bred in England. Another
lot of ten pairs which I had ordered from Chengtu, as I had some
further inquiries from India and Japan for Derbyans, was sent off for
me from Chungking in June, 1928, and escaped in Ichang, but finally
six birds were recaptured and reached Shanghai in November. They
have also found their way into the aviaries of some prominent Japanese
and French fanciers. This year I have only seen one single cock in
our bird market, which had been brought down privately.
Already in pre-war time it had been my great ambition to get some
of the rare Chinese Pheasants, such as blue and white Crossoptilons,
Temminck's Tragopans, Chinese Monauls, etc. I offered high prices
to different bird dealers and supplied them with coloured plates which
they could send into the interior, but all my efforts were in vain. Then
about two years ago I made the acquaintance of a Chinese dealer who
formerly did a large business in fancy feathers. Knowing that years
ago a good many of the tail-feathers of the blue Crossoptilon were
exported (by the way under the name of Grue de Numidie), I showed
him a picture of the bird and asked him whether he could obtain some
live birds for me.
He said he would try, but it would be very difficult, as he had to send
a man to Kansu, to which province there is no connection by rail or
water. A few days after our conversation he appeared again in my
office and told me he was willing to send a man, provided I paid him
#50 in advance and agreed to a certain price for every bird he would
bring alive to Shanghai. This price was of course exorbitantly high,

but after some bargaining we came to an agreement and tbe dealer
and myself signed a formal contract.
This was in August, 1928 ; month after month went by and I
heard nothing more of my dealer until in February, 1929, he turned
up again with the agreeable news that his man was on his way to
Hankow with twenty-eight birds. I waited another three months, and
finally on the 6th May, the very same day I had received my Derbyans
a year ago, the Crossoptilons arrived. They were packed in six large
baskets in which they had been carried for nearly six months by kulis
and donkeys up to Hankow. Ordinarily the journey from Kansu to
Hankow takes only about two months, but on account of the revolt
of the Mahomedans in Kansu and of so many bandits and robbers being
about, my man had often to wait for weeks in villages for a protected
caravan with which he could proceed further. From Hankow he
went, of course, by steamer. Notwithstanding the long journey the
Pheasants were in good health. They were, of course, rather dirty
and their tail feathers were all cut, but when I had installed them in
a large aviary which I had constructed in my stable and provided
them with plenty of sand, they soon improved. I gave them a mixture
of minced beef and bran in the morning, paddy and hemp in the after-
noon, and greenstuff ad lib. They were all very tame from the beginning
and would feed from my hand. During the next few days I made,
however, a very unpleasant discovery, namely, that the flock consisted
mostly of cocks. This, according to my experience, is so often the
case with gallinaceous wild-caught birds. I have often seen wild Golden
Pheasants in our bird market in quantities, but amongst fifty birds
there was very often not a single hen.
After careful examination I came to the conclusion that I had only
two certain hens. A few weeks later one proved her sex by laying
three large eggs and the other one I saw pairing with a cock. These were
surely signs of well-being, and I therefore decided to despatch my birds.
Four were finally safely landed in Japan, eighteen in France, and one
went to the Zoo of London.
Let us hope that the two hens are still alive and will prove prolific
mothers of many little Crossoptilons, so that Europe will be the richer
by a handsome and interesting Pheasant.

Sydney Porter--Notes on the Birds of Dominica
I am now after the white Crossoptilon which lives in Tibet, and have
great hopes to see specimens in Shanghai during this year. If my hopes
materialize I will put a white Crossoptilon feather in my cap and walk
through the streets of Shanghai one of the proudest men of the Far East.

" Siffleur de Montagne " or the Solitair ( Myadestes dominicanus).
--Deep in the heart of the mountain forests one meets with this remark-
able bird, but alas, it is seldom seen, though upon one occasion I did
catch sight of a bird and watched it for a time.
It is the one creature which impresses the rare travellers who
penetrate into its home ; for in the stillness and the gloom one hears
proceeding out of the dense undergrowth a series of the most remarkable
aud clear notes which at once arrest the ear and call one to attention.
This wonderful songster is about the size of a small Thrush and of
a beautiful pearl-grey colour marked with chestnut, black and white.
Gosse has written extensively on this bird or rather an allied species
in his Birds of Jamaica. After the Mozambique Shrike I know of no
bird with such remarkable vocal powers.
Perhaps I may be forgiven for quoting a short piece from a very rare
and ancient book which I had the good fortune to pick up recently,
Thomas Attwood's History of the Island of Dominica, which book
contains many interesting and quaint descriptions of the mammals and
birds of the island.
" The mountain whiftler is of the size of an Englifh lark and is
remarkable only for its loud charming whittle, which refembles the
human voice in the melodious notes; but which the bird varies in a
moft aftonifhing manner."
Again we read from the same source " What is remarkable of the
finging birds of this country is, that they lofe their finging faculties
when taken, pine away and die, notwithftanding the greateft attention

is paid to them." Evidently in those days the science of Aviculture
was little understood.
Antillean Cuckoo (Coccyzus minor shelleyi ).--These are quiet
unobtrusive birds which creep about the bushes and undergrowth.
I once watched a pair of these birds, the cock was feeding the hen with
hairy caterpillars and every time he brought her one he jumped on to
her back and dropped it into her wide open mouth. The plumage of
these birds is exceedingly loose and fluffy, and is continually blown
about by the slightest breeze. The birds make a series of strange sounds
which are very unbirdlike, in fact they are almost identical with the
sounds made by the Senegal Coucal, a bird with which I was familiar
in Africa ; these sounds consist of a series of loud deep " ohs " which
get faster and sound somewhat like water running out of a long-necked
bottle and sometimes the bird makes a sound like a door on rusty
hinges slowly opening and shutting. Often the birds would come
around the house to feed upon the large hairy caterpillars which
abounded, and their strange cries were one of the characteristic sounds
of that region.
I spent many pleasant hours seated under the great trees near the
house watching these charming birds, which were quite fearless. They
would come within a few yards and take an intelligent interest in what
I was doing ; suddenly they would appear quite close to one and remain
so until one took one's eyes off them, then they disappeared as silently
as they came.
These Cuckoos are exceedingly beautiful in a quiet way and were
quite my favourite birds in Dominica. The good they do in destroying
harmful caterpillars which no other birds will eat must be inestimable.
Their plumage is a striking arrangement of soft brown, black, white and
grey, the feathers being exceedingly soft and silky.
Ani (Crotophaga ani). --A very strange-looking bird, more like a
miniature Hornbill and yet it is related to the Cuckoos. It is to be
seen usually where cattle pasture, attracted no doubt by the flies, and
it is also to be seen by the road sides where the mountain streams
trickle over them. One always sees these birds in little companies
of about six or seven, and they always keep surprisingly close to each
other. In fact, I have never come across such a gregarious bird ; they

reminded me more of the Touracos than any other birds, having the
same gregarious habits and the same peculiar undulating flight, and
by following one behind the other when flying from one tree to another.
Members of a flock are seldom more than a few feet from one another,
but often a couple will steal a few moments and fly to an adjoining
tree, there to perform a mutual toilet.
In the lovely valley near the house I occupied I once saw rather an
amusing incident, two such birds as mentioned above were preening
each others' feathers when a big old fellow much larger than the rest
of the flock, and who was sitting not far away, evidently felt jealous,
so he flew on to the backs of the devoted couple and with a lot of
pushing gradually wheedled his way in between the two birds. They
made no objection, and as soon as he had settled down they commenced
to give him a very thorough and none too gentle toilet. With scrupulous
care each bird did one side of him, commencing at the beak and gradually
going down to the tail. The old bird seemed to have got what he came
for and in a few minutes flew off and the two other birds at once sidled
up to each other again and went on love-making. Perhaps the old bird
was either the mother or father-in-law who came to receive what was
due from bis children ! These birds can teach us humans a few lessons,
for I have never seen groups of birds so solicitous towards each other's
welfare as these are, and though they are always in the closest proximity
they never seem to quarrel. No bird in the West Indies made a greater
appeal to me than this one, partly, I think, owing to the great comrade-
ship shown to one another.
The Ani is not, I believe, a native of the Lesser Antilles, but was
introduced many years ago from Jamaica and Cuba. It is one of the
most valuable birds in the West Indies to the farmers and planters,
for it consumes enormous quantities of obnoxious insects. It also
follows cattle, settling on their backs and picking off the flies and ticks.
These propensities are recognized, and the bird is protected in all the
islands.
Gosse states that these birds build a communal nest where five or
six pairs of birds " bring forth and educate a common family ". The
birds always have the appearance of being very shabby and dirty ;
I don't know why it should be, perhaps it is because the colour of the

plumage is like that of an old faded black apron. Gosse also tells us
that the huge beak is used for opening out the soft earth, etc. ; he says
that " if a patch of cow's dung be examined after Crotophagas have been
searching for the larvae, it will be found furrowed as if a miniature
plough has passed through it ". Although I have never seen the bird
doing this, the beak is usually very dirty and muddy as though the
bird had been prodding about in the earth.
Grey Thrush (Allenis fasca). --This sombre-looking Thrush is a
very common bird around the old cultivated lands, but while a true
Thrush I have never seen it on the ground. Though living around the
country houses it is wild and shy and as soon as it sees that it is being
observed it plunges into the dense bush. This Thrush has the sweetest
and most mellow song of any bird of the Thrush family with which I am
acquainted. It seems to feed principally upon the small insects which
infest the lime-trees.
" Trembleur " (Cinclocerthia rujicauda). --I know of no English
name for this strange babbler-like bird. It is exceedingly common
and simply courts attention. It takes the same place in Dominica
as the Thrush does at home. It moves about in a very curious attitude,
with the long tail held upright like a Wren's and the wings fluttering
like those of a young bird expecting food. It has quite a fine song, too,
something like that of the European Thrush. I have frequently seen
it sipping the honey from the glorious scarlet flowers of a wonderful
tree which seems to grow quite commonly in certain parts of the
island. These trees seem to be the local rendezvous of the bird life in the
district, most species seem to flock there to sip the honey, or if they
don't imbibe the sweet liquid they find many insects which do.
When paying a visit to a beautiful estate in the centre of the island
I was very surprised to see these birds flying into the living veranda
and pick up crumbs and other tit-bits, there they were absolutely
fearless. One gets used to seeing small Einch-like birds coming in to a
house, but to see these strange denizens of the tropics in such close
contact with human beings was an unique sight. In colour this bird is
various shades of rich brown and in size about as large as a Turtle Dove
with a long slender beak. It is certainly one of the most striking
looking birds which inhabit the Antillean Islands.

--This bird is very un-Thrush-like indeed, and looks more like a glorified
Pipit, which I suppose it is, being a kind of connecting link between the
two families. I don't think that it has been recorded from Dominica
before. It is a migrant from North America. It differs from the
ordinary Pipit, for instead of having a dull whitish breast as most of
them have, this bird is a beautiful lemon yellow on the underparts
and in spite of being called a Thrush it appears to resemble the true
Pipits in all its habits. I found these birds in pairs in the valley I have
mentioned before, where they lived by the side of the drainage channels
continually running up and down in their search for insects, but if
disturbed they are quite ready to perch on the trees when occasion
demands.
Antillean Giant Kingfisher ( Ceryle alcyon). --An extremely
showy bird when on the wing, but a very shy one which shuns the
habitations of man. It frequents the deep and quiet reaches of the
rivers where it can fish with ease. I should think this bird has a very
easy living, for the rivers simply teem with fish. I have often seen it
by the sea shore ; on a lonely but very beautiful palm-fringed beach
where every day I used to bathe and have sun-baths lived a pair of these
birds, and as soon as I got down I could discover where they were
by their exceedingly loud and raucous cries. I rather fancy that they
had a nest there, but so wary were they that I never discovered it,
but I think that it was high up in the soft rock of the cliffs which closed
in the little beach.
Piviere's Buzzard (Buteo rivieri ).--There seem to be very few
birds of prey in Dominica as far as I could make out and a pair of these
fine birds lived in the river valley below the house where I resided for a
time, and it was a sight that pleased me more than any other to see these
grand birds floating high up in the celestial blue skies with outstretched
motionless pinions, sweeping round and round in huge spirals,
continually calling and answering one another with their loud and
plaintive calls.
The hen appears very much larger than the male when on the wing.
I often came across the male of the pair which inhabited the district,
when riding in the valleys. He appeared to be quite tame, and I often

used to watch, him within a few yards ; I would often disturb him on
the ground or in a thick bush, but could never find out what he was
doing; sometimes he would fly on to the stump of a tree and eye me
over until I got too close, when he would throw himself into the air
with the greatest ease and grace imaginable and sail off without a
single motion of his huge pinions to join his mate in some other
valley.
In time the birds seemed to get used to my presence, and I have
watched them both within a few yards feasting upon some small
mammal or lizard, but I never saw them eating a bird.
Caribbean Sparrow Hawk ( Falcocaribhaearum ).--My first introduc-
tion to this lovely little Hawk was rather dynamic, for, riding one day
along a rough track, a beautiful little male dashed almost under
my horse's head and seized a lizard off the road, which it carried to a
near-by tree and commenced to eat.
These Hawks are not common birds by any means, in fact no birds
of prey are common in the island.
Little Green Heron ( Butorides virescens maculata). --I always
had a particular affection for this jolly little chap because I so often
caught him unawares, creeping in the shallows of the rivers, not like
his larger cousins who always have their plumage compressed when
fishing, but with his plumes loose and waving in the breeze. As soon as
he caught sight of one, especially if one was very close up to him, he
would seem rather confused and ashamed at having been caught off
his guard ; he would hesitate and continue walking up-stream for
a minute or two, always keeping his eye on me, but the second I took
my eyes off him he was off in a flash, flying into a bush uttering his
strange harsh croak, which is extremely loud for so small a bird. If I
remained in the same spot perfectly quiet he would come back and with
some hesitation would resume his fishing, which consisted of walking
almost imperceptibly up the stream catching little fishes as he went.
This little heron is extremely beautiful and would make an ideal
aviary bird. I believe it is a migrant from North America.
If anyone is interested in Herons I would advise them to read

I have ever read on the Herons of North America--in fact all the books
published by the Institute on bird life are very fine and quite
inexpensive.
Blue Heron (Florida ccerulea ccerulescens ).--By the side of the
rushing boulder-strewn mountain rivers and streams one is sure to see
this bird, usually in pairs, but the birds often work some distance
apart from each other. I have often watched them wading in a rushing
torrent that would almost have swept a strong man off his feet, but
I suppose that the bird would grip the stones with its huge feet. There
are few sights more beautiful than this Heron fishing in the indescribably
lovely Dominican rivers, which are as clear as crystal and overhung
with graceful palms, tree-ferns, and flowering trees ; every movement
is grace as he slowly stalks along with his spotless plumage tightly
compressed against his body. Sometimes he will rest and relax,
shaking out his beautiful filamentous plumes until he seems completely
enveloped in them. One of the strangest things about this Heron is
that the young birds are for the first year pure white , and until I knew
this I thought the birds were Egrets ; this is a most extraordinary
thing, for in the case of most young birds the immature dress is usually
of a protective nature until they have learnt the ways of the world ;
but in this case it is the reverse, and I have noticed that the young
birds are much shyer than the adults. The old birds are a uniform
dark slate-blue.
While in the white phase the birds are extremely shy and difficult
to approach. In this plumage the birds look very beautiful and
ethereal, and even more beautiful than the old birds, even though they
lack the long plumes. I was told that there was a nesting colony of
these Herons on the other side of the island, but I was never able to-
get across to see it.
Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea). --The home
of this Heron is in the mangrove swamps which are found all round
the island ; it does not seem to frequent the freshwater streams like
the other Herons and is mostly seen perched on the great aerial roots
of the mangroves which often grow right out into the sea. It is
a thick-set but very beautiful Heron, and very different in appearance
to the other slim and graceful Herons of the island. It is one of the

few birds besides the Parrots and Pigeons which is sought after by the
natives for food.
The general colour of this bird is a light grey with longitudinal
markings of black on the wings and back ; the head is adorned with
a long crest of white feathers and the crown slightly tinged with yellow,
but why the bird has the very foolish name of 44 violacea " I cannot
make out, for there is not the slightest trace of violet in its plumage.
The back is adorned with long filamentous plumes very different
from the ordinary Heron. They are the same width the whole of their
length, whilst those of the other Herons taper towards the point.
These birds feed mostly on the large land crabs which abound in
Dominica; the birds first break off the stalk-like eyes, when they
have the crabs quite at their mercy: they then proceed to smash
the thick and heavy shell by repeated blows from their very stout
beak, which is like a pickaxe.
The natives told me that they had frequently seen these Herons
dead with the neck firmly grasped between the claws of a giant crab.
I can quite believe this, for I have seen crabs with claws nearly as large
as a man's hand. The native name for this bird is 44 Crabbier
This is the wildest and the shyest of all the Herons I came across :
the sight of a human being will send it miles away, and by no amount
of stalking can it be found again. One comes across evidences of
the bird's handiwork on nearly all the little palm beaches--the shells
of crabs picked perfectly clean and very systematically broken up.
I believe that it feeds on some of the large shell-fish too, for I have
often seen collections of broken shells which no other creature would
have had the strength to break up.
I think that the ornithologist who named this bird 44 violacea "
was either wearing blue glasses at the time or had been tasting some
of the West Indian 44 mountain dew ", a tablespoonful of which is
enough to make one see things in quite a different light!
This species is not so nocturnal as would be imagined by its name,
for it is only seen during the day.
I believe there exists in Dominica a large and, I think, undescribed
species of Heron which appears to be nocturnal. The natives say
that it lives by day in the inaccessible forests on Morne Diablotin,

comes down to the sea-shore about six o'clock in the evenings to feed,
and returns about midnight. Many natives have told me that they
have seen it when they were fishing by torchlight about midnight.
This bird has been minutely described to me by many natives and all
the descriptions seem to coincide. I don't think that any white man
has seen one. The natives told me that after the terrible hurricane
of 1928 the birds ceased to be seen or to frequent the shores. Could
it be that this was some rare and nearly extinct species which has now
ceased to exist altogether ?
Frigate Bird (Fregata aquila). --On the wing one of the most
graceful birds in the world, it is lighter and more agile even than an
Albatross, but on land one of the most ungainly birds that one could
imagine. Sometimes one of these flying wanderers would come over
from the other side of the island and stay for a few hours' fishing in
our little palm-fringed bay. There is something very elusive and
mysterious about these birds ; like the Albatross they just wander
or rather glide on motionless wings around the tropics, belonging to
no country in particular--a real wanderer with no home.
Yellow-legged Sandpiper (Totanus flavipes ).--This jolly little
bird is found by every river and stream in Dominica, where he may
be seen running with great rapidity over the pebbles by the water's
edge, wagging his stumpy tail in the same manner as a Pitta, and
feeding upon the small crustaceans which abound there.
Strange to say that, common as the bird is, I have never seen more
than one bird in a given area. Right up in the mountain forests I have
seen them wherever there is water, such as a fast-running mountain
stream or river.
These little " Yellow-legs ", as they are called in the States, are
always quite tame, and very many pleasant hours I have spent by
the side of a shady river watching my little friend and other water birds.
The Antillean Ground Dove (Columbigallina passerina trochila).
--A bird that is commoner and tamer than the Sparrows in Barbados,
but in Dominica it is wild and unapproachable ; this is the same with
all the Doves and Pigeons of the latter island, and is no doubt due
to the constant persecution by the natives, who think them very
toothsome morsels.

In Barbados they will almost take food from out of one's hand,,
but here the sight of a human being will cause them to flee in abject-
terror and, owing to this, they are very difficult to study. I do not-
know whether these birds have been imported to England, but they
would make very charming aviary birds and would be very easy to-
capture, for the ones in Barbados could easily be caught with a
butterfly net.
These tiny Doves are usually to be seen feeding upon the small
seeds round about the bare patches under the lime-trees, but in Bridge-
town in Barbados they are to be seen in every garden and also in the-
streets picking up crumbs, seeds, and all manner of vegetable food.
The Antillean Dove (Zenaida castanea ).--Like the above bird
this lovely Dove, which in the island of Barbados is exceedingly common
and familiar, frequenting the gardens and main streets, is in Dominica
excessively wild and shy, and this is due to the same reason that it is-
much sought after as food by the natives, as in fact are all the Pigeons.
It is a most lovely creature and one of the most beautiful Doves I know,
certainly the most beautiful that inhabits the Antillean Islands. Its-
strangely mournful call can be heard all over the island, a sound which,
when heard in the distance, is particularly soothing. Once I came
across a boy with three of these exquisite Doves, carrying them by a
string tied to their legs, and they also had their wing-feathers cut.
I asked him what he was going to do with them and he promptly
replied that he was going to eat them, so I saved their lives by paying;
sixpence each for them. About an hour afterwards he turned up again
with another three. These poor creatures were purchased and the vendor
soundly rated, I suppose with little or no effect! I kept them for a
time, intending to bring them back to England, and when leaving the
windward side of the island for Boseau I put them (owing to having,
no other boxes or crates) in the crate containing my Parrots, but they
so disturbed these latter birds and made such a mess of their food,
that upon arriving in Roseau I gave them to a friend. I was sorry
at having to part with them for, as I have said before, I think they&quot;
are one of the most beautiful of Doves. The metalic rose-pink
colour of the neck is one of the most exquisite shades to be found i tl
Nature.

Sydney Porter--Notes on the Birds of Dominica
There were several other very rare ground Pigeons which inhabited
the depths of the forests and these were even more shy than the two
birds described above, and although I frequently put them up in my
wanderings in the forests I was never able to get near enough
to determine their species, but they no doubt belonged to either the
genus Columba or Geotrygon.
The Capped Petrel (CEstrelata hcesitata). --I have reason to think
that this supposedly extinct bird may still exist in very small numbers
on the island, for, when making a journey through the forest in search
\0x25A0of another nearly extirpated species, A. imperialis , my guide asked
me if I had ever heard of the Diablotin (the name under which the
species was known), for he said that there were still some left upon
the mountain, described them to me exactly, and finished up by saying
that they had webbed feet and nested in holes in the rocks. He said
that their haunts were almost inaccessible, and that they were never
killed now because no one ate them.
I mentioned this to several white people, including a well-known
American naturalist who was doing some research work on the island,
.and they ridiculed the idea. But I only hope that it may be true.
It is very distressing to the naturalist to reflect upon the numerous
species which have been exterminated since the advent of man in the
West Indies. Hundreds of species are known to have vanished,
and I dare say that there are many others from the smaller islands
which have disappeared and left no trace behind. Many of these
species were highly specialized and had no enemies, and were con-
sequently very slow breeders, so that in a few years they were quickly
disposed of by the men who settled on the islands, and I regret to say
that the work of extermination is still being carried on, and in the next
few years more will be added to the long list of vanished birds. I think
that I can definitely say that the most recent to be added to the appalling
list is the Black-billed or All Green Amazon of Jamaica (A. agilis),
and in a few years' time I think that most of the Parrots and Pigeons
from the various islands will join their deceased brethren.
To get back to the Diablotin. It is stated in Newton's Dictionary
of Birds that this bird has been exterminated by the introduction
of a carnivorous marsupial into the island, but this is not so, as a further

extract from that interesting old book, Attwood's History of the Island
of Dominica , will show :--
" The Diablotin fo called by the French, from its uncommonly
ugly appearance is nearly the lize of a Duck, and is web-footed. It
has a big round head, crooked bill like a hawk and large full eyes
like an Owl.
" Its head, part of the neck, chief feathers of the wings and tail,
are black; the other parts of its body are covered with a milk-white
down ; and its whole appearance is perfectly lingular. They feed
on fifh flying in great flocks to the fea side in the night-time ; and
in their flight make a difagreeable loud noife like Owls ; which bird
they do alfo refemble, by their diflike of making their appearance
in the day-time, when they are hid in holes in the mountains, where
they are easily caught. This is done by ftopping up fome of the holes ;
which lead to their hiding places and placing empty bags over the
rest, which communicate under-ground with thofe ftopped; the
birds at their ufual time of going forth to feek their food in the night-
time, finding their pafiage impeded, make to the holes covered with
the bags into which entering, they are immediately caught; and great
numbers of them taken in that manner in a short time.
" The flefh of the Diablotin is much admired by the French who
ufed formerly to export great quantities of them falted to Martinique
and other French islands; but the traffic was put a ftop to by the
Legiflature of Dominica who, by an Act made for apprehending
runaway negroes, prohibited the taking of thofe birds ; as before that
time, the runnaways being numerous in the woods, furnifhed great
quantities of them, for which they had in return, from fome ill-difpofed
white people, mufkets, powder and balls ; which they made ufe of
in murdering the Englifh inhabitants on the plantations."
The Barbados Blackbird (Holoquiscalus fortirostris). --Before
finishing this chapter on the birds of Dominica, I feel I must mention
my old friend the Barbados Blackbird or, as he is known in the United
States, the Purple Grackle, for even though he is not an inhabitant
as far as I know of Dominica, he is a West Indian bird. No one fails
to notice his glossy purple plumage and striking white eye, which
misses very very little in the way of food.

Mrs. A. B. Black--
I know of no bird so characteristic of a country as this bird is of
Barbados. He strikes the most casual visitor to the island, for he is
everywhere along the roadsides ; in the cane fields when the cane is
being cut he is almost under the very feet of the natives ; outside
the hotels he is there with an eye on the main chance. When you are
having a meal he will watch you like a hungry dog. In fact I cannot
imagine Barbados without its Blackbirds. You never see him still:
he is always hurrying about with that quick, business-like gait which
characterizes the Starling family. I often wonder why they do not
put his picture on the postage stamps.
No wonder he is also called the Tinkling Grackle, for his metallic
tinkle is heard every morning, noon, and evening from almost every
tree in the island.
This bird is indigenous to Barbados, but has been introduced to
many of the other islands.

BREEDING THE GREEN-NAPED PHEASANT
PIGEON IN CALIFORNIA

The Green-naped or Green-collared Pheasant Pigeon (Otidiphaps
nobilis) is a native of Western New Guinea, and is a large and very
beautiful Pigeon with iridescent plumage of bronzed wine-purple,,
with black head, red beak, and red eyes. The legs and feet are straw-
coloured and the toes rusty black. At the tarsal joint there are three
shades of purple, a purple streak extending also the full length of the
legs in both sexes, which becomes brighter in the nesting season.
I find them the most interesting birds in my collection, but I had tO&amp;apos;
study them for three years before I could persuade them to go to nest.
I arranged nests in different positions and at different heights in the
aviary, and they finally selected a low situation. They built their nest,
with sticks in the same way as other Pigeons, and laid one egg of a light
cream colour somewhat pointed at both ends. Incubation commenced,
immediately the egg was laid.

Curiously enough, the incubation period takes twenty-three days
in the case of a male chick and twenty-six days in the case of a female,
and on three occasions has taken twenty-nine days on account of wind
and unsettled weather. Neither egg or chick are visible until the
latter is three weeks' old, the parents sitting very closely and in relieving
one another one sits by the side of the other and the one that has been
sitting gently slides off, the other sliding on, never allowing egg or
chick to be uncovered.
When the chick first becomes visible it is jet black, including eyes,
beak, and legs, and the feathers give the appearance of a porcupine's
quills.
The female sits on the nest at night, the male relieving her at
eight o'clock in the morning. He remains until twelve-thirty the
next day, when she relieves him for half an hour. She again takes
charge at five-thirty in the evening and remains on the nest for the
night.
They are the most affectionate birds I have ever seen at the nesting
period. When they hear the young in the shell they both sit side by
side with their bills together and their heads down close to the nest,
and continue to act thus until the egg is hatched. The cock feeds
the hen on the nest for the first week after hatching, she feeding the
young bird. After this they relieve one another, as during incubation,
until the young bird is able to leave the nest. At four months' old
the baby is able to take care of itself.
I have at present three breeding pairs. One pair of the younger
breeders has at the time of writing a baby in the nest (10th April).
The old original pair are now building their nest.
I find that the first egg of the season produces a cock-bird, the next
a hen ; so, by keeping a careful record of the eggs laid and hatched,
I am able to tell the sex as each one appears, which is useful, as the
sexes are exactly alike.
Each pair of birds occupies a pen measuring 10 feet by 18 feet,
covered with small-mesh wire netting, and alfalfa growing in the pen
at all times. A pile of fresh cow manure is also kept in the pen to
supply insect life, which they seem to require. Mixed Pigeon feed is
fed and Barnes' Emulsion is given during the nesting period. The nest

Breeding the Green-naped Pheasant Pigeon
is well dusted with, a mite powder we make ourselves, which keeps
them free of mites, fleas, and other annoying insects, of which we have
plenty in our warm Southern Californian climate. The enclosed
picture is of a young female and her first baby, which is about four
weeks old. You will note that they are mounted and that the
peculiar feathering of the young bird is still noticeable, the legs and
feet and bill being still black.
Am enclosing a copy of a letter I received from Mr. E. W. Gifford,
of 1650 Yista St. Oakland, California, which I wish you would
incorporate with mine :--
" Dear Mrs. Black,
There are three species of the Pheasant Pigeons belonging to genus
Otidiphaps. Sometimes the term Pheasant Pigeon is applied to birds
of the genus Macropygia , which are more correctly Cuckoo Pigeons.
The Pheasant Pigeons of the genus Otidiphaps belong to the sub-
family- of Pigeons called Geotrygeninae , the Partridge Pigeons or Quail
Doves.
The Green Collared Pigeon ( Otidiphaps noblis) which you are breeding
is native to Western New Guinea and the island of Batanta. Your
specimens are the only ones I know of in America.
The White Collared Pheasant Pigeon ( Otidiphaps cervicalis) hails
from South-Eastern New Guinea. The New York Zoological Park
has one at present. The Eergusson Island Pheasant Pigeon (Otidiphaps
insularis) is from the island of that name, one of the D'Entrecesteaux
group, off the eastern end of New Guinea. I am writing the secretary
of the Avicultural Society, London, proposing you for membership.
With pleasant memories of our recent visit.

By Capt. C. Scott Hopkins
With the permission of the Editor, I am taking this opportunity
of giving a short account of my Fancy Pheasants. I am hoping that
I may, by writing in this Magazine, encourage a few more bird-lovers
to go in for Pheasants. Although so many of these beautiful birds come
from hot climates, they are not, as*is thought by some people, delicate
or difficult to keep. On the contrary, they are mostly very hardy and
easy to keep. Of course there is a risk with freshly imported birds
until they become acclimatized, but with ordinary care and attention
they soon settle down and thrive. I prefer aviary-bred birds, and these
are nearly always available, but with such birds as Tragopans and
Firebacks there is sometimes a difficulty, and then one has to rely on
imported stock. But a word of advice to anyone wishing to buy freshly
imported Pheasants from dealers. Go and choose them yourself and as
soon as you can after their arrival in this country. I speak from
experience ! The beginner must not be down-hearted if he should lose
a few now and then. It may be his own fault or just bad luck. Go on
trying, and I will promise you your efforts will be rewarded. Providing
you have suitable aviaries, either grass or gravel, that you feed
them regularly with wheat, maize, and a little dari and plenty of green
food winter as well as summer, there is no reason why they should not
thrive and do well. I am not going to give a detailed account of how
I keep my Pheasants, dimensions of aviaries, etc., etc., as I shall be
taking up too much space, but I shall be very pleased to give what
advice I can to anyone who is thinking of keeping these lovely birds.
I have forty-eight aviaries, and keep about twenty-one varieties---

The Minister of Health has prohibited the importation of Parrots
into this country for the present, as from 20th May, the Order including
all kinds of Parrots from all countries. This seems to be a very drastic
move seeing that the only trouble has come from South American
Parrots. Most of the European countries have also stopped the
importation of Parrots generally, but the United States has only
placed an embargo upon Parrots from South America. The con-
sequence of this will be that the trade in Parrots will all be diverted
to America.
It would seem that those responsible for this drastic Order do not
know one Parrot from another and have not taken the trouble to
consult those who do know. They have presumably been advised
entirely by the medical profession, and the fact that the doctors believe
the disease which has been responsible for the death of some fourteen
people in a population of over ten millions, to be traceable to Parrots
is sufficient to convince them that Parrots must be banned from entering
this country.
But why on earth stop Lories and Cockatoos when the only Parrots
accused of transmitting &amp;apos;psittacosis are the Amazons ? Why make
Australia and India suffer for the sins of South America ?
Take the case of the Budgerigar. This is never nowadays imported
from the country of its origin. It is now a domestic bird like the
Canary in all European countries as well as in Japan, and all those
that have been coming into this country within the last few years,
and their number has been legion, have been captivity-bred birds.
Why they should be accused of being disease carriers it is difficult to
understand.

The effect of the embargo will be more serious than is generally
realized, for not only will it mean loss to the importers of Parrots,

Sir, --Dr. Karl Plath's Hanging Parrots would appear to be one of
the subspecies allied to the Golden-backed--possibly Worcester's--
Loriculus worcesteri. The sexual distinction is as given. The destructive
kabits of the Ringneck which visits Captain Hamilton Scott's garden
are probably largely due to the fact that it is maintaining itself entirely
*on natural food. Palceornis Parrakeets at liberty that are well fed on
.seed and peanuts do not touch buds to any appreciable degree, nor do
they damage flowers. They are, however, wastefully destructive among
apples, as are the Tanygnathi , and need to be confined from June to
October for that reason.
Polyteline, Aprosmictine and the larger Platycercine Parrakeets
are apt to be a bit hard on fruit-tree buds from the end of February
to the end of April, and the two latter genera also eat ripe apples,
but seldom do very serious damage. By having one's birds under control
.at the feeding places it is quite easy to enjoy their beauty at liberty
without any appreciable mischief being done to one's own or one's
neighbour's gardens. It is not unusual for the Plum-headed Parrakeet
to nest in a cage--I know of at least two instances--but the eggs are
seldom fertile.

Sir, --The letter in the March issue of the Magazine concerning
the attempted importation into the U.S.A. of the Cuban Tody was
very interesting. The reason I am writing this letter is to throw a little
light on the manner of obtaining " live food " when on board a ship,
for this would seem rather a difficult problem unless one "is in the
know " as we say in this part of the world.

Several years ago I always had. great difficulty when trying to
import delicate " softhills " into England which I had picked up on
my travels until I found that the kitchens, pantries, and stores of
nearly all ships simply swarmed with cockroaches, both large and small
varieties.
The first thing is to get to know the pantry steward, and then
with the aid of " bakhsheesh " get him to set traps for these creatures
in the warm places where they swarm.
The trap is an easy matter. One takes a large tumbler, places a
tablespoonful of coffee grains at the bottom, then smears butter, lard,
or some other greasy substance all round the glass inside about an
inch from the top : this allows the insects to get in, but they cannot
get out again over the grease.
Sometimes one will get half a tumblerful in a night, and these are
greatly relished by all " softbills They are much better than
mealworms.

BIRDS SINGING AT NIGHT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998702375" page_id="56211633"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
Sir, --No doubt many readers who have kept Budgerigars in any
numbers have noticed that their birds sing or warble--or whatever
one may care to call it--after dusk and, in fact, quite late into the
night when all else is silent. A still night with a gentle pattering
rain seems to be the time when they become most vocal. It does not
matter how dark it is or how late, and the whole company seem to
join in, so that with just under a hundred birds, as I have at present,
the volume of sound is very considerable, but not in the least
objectionable.
The following incident is, however, my excuse for penning these
notes, and I shall be interested to hear if any members have had
a similar occurrence.
One of my cock Cockatiels has been singing at night. I think
one is quite justified in calling their pretty spring trill and whistle
a song, being quite a musical effort without any harsh or discordant
notes. On most occasions it has been after I have gone to bed, and

curiously enough the Budgerigars nearby have been quite silent.
Nor has the other cock Cockatiel in a neighbouring aviary attempted
to join in.
Some years ago I was puzzled by hearing at night a pretty but
unfamiliar song, not unlike, but more full than, a Hedge Accentor's.
It always seemed to come from the same spot and the singer was
ultimately discovered to be a cock Snow Bunting in the aviary.
I have never seen it recorded that this species sings at night, but
of course his wild brethren at that period of the year--May--would
be nesting in the far North, many miles from human habitation.

Sir, --I have just returned from a second round trip to the West
Indies. Although bird life is plentiful upon the various islands
specimens are hard to obtain, for catchers and sellers appear to
concentrate solely upon the various species of Parrots, Macaws, and
Parrakeets. I managed to obtain a magnificent Troupial in Trinidad,
and have got him home safely. I also purchased in the Slobbock
Market at Demerara two Kudari birds. Up to now I can get these
birds to eat no soft food other than bread and milk, the diet used and
recommended by their previous owners. Of course, fruit in large
quantities is included in their dietary. These birds were sheltered in
the kitchen of the ship during the last ten days of the voyage, as the
weather was extremely sunless and cold. They are all alive at the
moment of writing, but I would greatly appreciate advice from more
experienced members as to their proper treatment.
In the Museum at Demerara I noticed a large cage containing
some small birds. Upon the cage was displayed the following notice :--
"It is against the law to keep these little birds in captivity, but
these specimens were taken from bad cruel boys who had trapped
and caged them. As they could now no longer find their own food
if set at liberty we keep them here out of kindness. Always be kind
to dumb animals."
If only catchers would interest themselves with smaller fry than

the Parrot tribes there would doubtless be some beautiful and enter-
taining specimens exported to England. There is the glossy black
fellow, with the golliwog eyes like the Black-cheeked Parrakeet, which
flies about the streets of Trinidad, a bird resembling a black Starling
somewhat. Then there is his near relative, a smaller black bird of the
same type, but without the golliwog eyes, which struts about the
streets of St. Vincent. I missed a magnificent pair of young St. Vincent
Parrots,reared from the nest, because owing to the recent parrot-fever
our Captain had forbidden Parrots being brought aboard. I saw many
species of Humming-birds flying in the gardens of houses situated in
the various towns. The West Indian and South American birds
appear to have much less fear of man than their European brethren. At
St. Vincent the grey Mocking Bird was conspicuous, and could be
both heard and seen. At Barbados in the bush near the Swimming
Club birds were plentiful. I am not sufficiently educated to identify
them.

Blue/Grey wing ; Laurel/Blue/Grey wing ; and Green/Blue/Grey wing.
From these I hoped to breed Greywing-blues next year.
The parents of the Blue cock 7, I was told, bred Whites in the same
nest. In 1928 I mated him to the Blue hen 20, and out of 18 eggs in
three nests she reared 5 Whites and 12 Blues. In 1929, as shown in
the pedigree, I mated him to the Green/Blue hen 14, out of 19 eggs
she reared 2 Greywing-green/Blues, 5 Blues, and 9 Green/Blues.
These Whites and Greywings were apparently due to the Blue
cock 7 : because the Blue hen 20 in 1929 mated to the Mauve cock 60
out of 20 eggs reared 16 Cobalts. And the Green/Blue hen 14 mated
first to a Green/Blue cock 13 and afterwards to an Olive/Mauve 24
in three nests 1928 reared out of 21 eggs, 2 Cobalts, 2 Blues, 9 Laurels,
and 5 Greens.
Whilst I was away from home for a couple of days the attendant
heard a row going on in the breeding pen and found the Cobalt hen 296
had killed the youngest of the Grey wing-blues : it was just old enough
to tell that it was a Grey wing, but not whether it was a Grey wing-blue
or Greywing-cobalt.
The hen was covered with blood : she had gone quite crazy and
had scalped her youngster and was trying to kill the others, but was-
removed in time to save them from any damage. The cock bird
is now feeding the others, and as one of them is already out in the
flight I hope he will not have to labour alone for long.

A DEATH FROM OLD AGE
Sir, --Despite the not infrequent expression of opinions of a contrary
nature it is a rare thing for an aviculturist to lose a bird from down-
right old age and nothing else. There are comparatively few people
who do not enormously under-estimate potential avian longevity,
so that if a bird dies suddenly after what appears to them to be the
normal span of the life of the species, they put it down to " old age "
even though a post-mortem examination would have revealed some
very definite disease or injury. Insufficiency of exercise, especially
when combined with a faulty diet, will, in a longer or shorter period.

induce a condition of all-round debility, but this premature breaking
down of a bird's system, although it may be accompanied by many
of the symptoms of old age, cannot be regarded as a really genuine
example of the phenomenon.
Until recently I cannot honestly say that a single bird in my
collection has ever passed from full vigour to decline and death from
pure old age. Some four specimens have died wholly or mainly from
age, but all were markedly senile and on the downward path when
I received them.
The death last week of a cock Princess of Wales' Parrakeet after
a residence of about sixteen years in my collection was therefore,
very interesting to me as the first definite case I have had the chance
of observing of a bird which has grown old under good conditions
and has died naturally. What age the Parrakeet may have been when
I received him I cannot say. I believe he was aviary-bred in Australia,
which may account for the fact that he was never a very fine specimen,
being small and of poor colour, with washed-out tips to the longer
tail-feathers. For several years he was mated to a Crimson-wing,
and after one or two initial failures succeeded in rearing two hybrids,
the survivor of which has often appeared on the show bench. In
1927 and 1928 the Princess of Wales' proved infertile. In 1929 I did
not use him for breeding and last autumn he did not moult properly.
As the winter advanced he became very lame, and although he recovered
from the weakness or injury he remained thenceforward abnormally
inactive. Most of the day he spent sleeping. Like a sick bird he
kept his head " under his wing " and both feet on the perch, but unlike
a sick bird he often stretched himself and his appetite and digestion
remained as good as ever. His power of flight was retained to the end.
The last morning he came out of the shelter when the slide was raised,
but soon went back again. At 11 o'clock he was sleeping peacefully
in the sun but was obviously failing, and when I went to look at him
after lunch he was dead. I sent the body to the Eoyal Veterinary
College, but careful expert examination failed to reveal any evidence
of disease. Time had dealt very gently with the old fellow : his
actual passing had been quick and the period of preparation, though
long, had been quiet and peaceful. Tavistock.

PHEASANTS

Pheasant, reaches the South of Russia in the wild state. Their range
extends in the Palsearctic regions from the Caucasus to Manchuria,
and in the East to Japan. More southern species may be found
*on the peninsula of India, and in Ceylon, Java, and Palawan in
the Philippines.
All Pheasants are largely graminivorous : some, such as the Trago-
pens, are very fond of fruit, leaves, and buds of trees. Others, notably
Argus and the Peacock Pheasants, prefer insects. Others, as the
Crossoptilons and Lophophorous, dig in the ground with their beaks,
seeking for worms, larvae, and roots.
The genus Phasianus frequents open spots among brushwood
and high grass. Most of the others live in forests, many never leave
these at all. Their range is from the ice-bound solitudes of Mongolia,
Tibet, and the Himalayan slopes to the hottest Equatorial forests.
Pheasants are mostly polygamous, but in captivity some seem to
prefer monogamy. In the wild state, a cock, having fixed on his
displaying ground, calls the hens, which usually come singly. In

captivity the hens will not agree : they fight and disturb each other
while pairing, so that finally only the strongest of them is fertilized :
but they are not strictly monogamous like Partridges. If several
hens are housed in adjoining aviaries and the cock is admitted to each
of them in turn, the eggs will all be fertile.
Pheasants nest on the ground, among bushes or herbage. Certain
genera {Polyelectron and Argus) lay two eggs to the clutch, and the
Argus, at any rate, lays several times in the season. Others lay from
six to twenty eggs and normally have only one brood. The young
run as soon as they are hatched, and can fly well enough to perch
when about ten days old.
Housing .--Nearly all kinds of Pheasants live and breed quite well
in Europe. They are usually kept in aviaries, but succeed as well
when enjoying partial freedom in a park.
The most suitable aviary for a pair (or for a cock and several hens)
consists of a shelter of from 1 to 2 yards by 2 to 4 yards and an open
flight of between 2 to 4 yards by 4 to 8 yards. Very large species
of course, must have more room. But all kinds thrive in proportion
to the space which can be given them.
The shelter should be made of wrnod or masonry, be well lighted
and provided with thick perches ; the floor should be paved, but heat
is not necessary for the great majority of the species. After they have
had a year in which to become acclimatized, even the tender tropical
species usually survive the winter provided they are kept in the shelter
at night and during bad weather. Nevertheless, in cold districts,
before the birds are acclimatized, it is important to keep them
in a heated place through the winter and to shut them
in for the night even in summer and especially whenever it rains,
for Pheasants feel damp even more than cold. It is a good thing to
have the shelters divided into two compartments for reasons which
will be given later.
The open part should be made of wire-netting on a wood or iron
frame, and the mesh must be small enough to exclude rats, sparrows,
etc. The wire or the foundations must be laid underground. The
flight should be planted with thick bushes or have hedges along the
partitions, which themselves must have screens of fibro-cement, zinc.

or heather, etc., at least 2 feet high, in order to give the birds privacy
and prevent them from fighting through the wire. Pheasant aviaries
are usually built side by side, so as to make a pheasantry ; the soil
should be very light, slightly sloping, and turfed, save for a few sanded
spots. It must not be forgotten that gravel is indispensable as well
as cinders, sand, or fine dry earth, in which the birds can dust them-
selves. Water should be placed in every aviary and the receptacles
must be kept clean ; running water is not very satisfactory, because it
prevents the use of disinfectants and medicines.
The aspect of the aviary is very important: it should face either
south or east--the west and north are unsuitable; Himlalayan
Pheasants can better endure the south in summer than the north in
winter. The ideal would be to have a double flight, one facing north
for the summer, the other facing south for the winter.
Pheasants are often very shy, and hit themselves against the wire
of their compartments, injuring their heads and even killing themselves.
When the shelter is divided into two parts the birds can run from one
into the other. The ten first flight feathers of one wing must be cut
off all those Pheasants which have a tendency to dash themselves
against the roof of their flight, which is what almost always happens
with Mongolians, Versicolors, and " game " Pheasants. Some breeders
prefer to pinion their birds in order to prevent losses from panics,
but this must not be done to hens of kinds where the cocks are dangerous,
for if they are pinioned they cannot escape the attacks of the cocks.
Should a head be torn or wounded it must at once be sewn up, drawing
the edges together and being careful to join the scraps of skin which
leave the skull bare.
On arrival it is a good plan to keep delicate species shut indoors
until they have quite got over the journey ; this may take a whole
year.
Pheasants are extremely combative and, generally speaking, not
more than one pair or a cock and two or three hens can be kept in the
same aviary. Sometimes several cocks can be kept together in a large
aviary without hens but this often leads to accidents. In semi-liberty
many individuals of one species, or even several species, can be kept
together, but careful watch must be kept and quarrelsome individuals

removed. It will be found that birds belonging to widely separated
genera seldom fight together.
Feeding .--The basis of Pheasant food is corn. Wheat is best,
but whole or kibbled maize is very good, particularly in autumn and
winter, but it must not be the sole food. If Pheasants eat only maize
they will become over-fat and there will be very many infertile eggs.
Millet, buckwheat, or barley may be given, and in Spring and while
laying, some hemp. Variety is good ; to the morning ration of corn
add a custard made of pollard and crushed biscuit in equal parts,
together with 5 to 10 per cent of meat or fish meal.
Excellent results are obtained in Italy by giving ground silk worm
papse and chopped dried figs, lightly powdered with maize flour.
The feeding must be regulated according to the season and the
species and condition of the birds.
Green food is essential. If there is not sufficient good grass in
the flights dry salad must be given. Berries and fruit are excellent,
even necessary for some kinds, also carrots either cooked or raw.
Finally, when they first come over it is desirable to give a little chopped
raw meat. Argus and Eheinhardts should always have some. The
usual titbits given to aviary birds are liked by Pheasants.
Rearing .--Pheasants in confinement usually lay between March
and June. It is inadvisable to let the hens sit in small aviaries,
for they are usually too wild to be steady ; but in large enclosures,
as a rule, they will sit and make good mothers, and amateurs who
either cannot or will not devote much time to rearing will do well to
let the birds sit and rear their broods. The cock and any other hens
in the same compartment must be removed and proper food given.
The great objection to this plan is that it often stops the hens from
laying again, and in wet seasons or cold districts the young often die
from insufficient shelter. It happens too, sometimes, that the mother
is weakened by sitting too long and falls ill and dies.
It is much safer to take away the eggs as they are laid, replacing
them with artificial eggs, and to confine them to broody hens, small
ones preferably.
These broodies must be placed in suitable nests. I like wooden
boxes best, with wire-netting bottoms and roofs of fibro-cement,

in the open air. The hens are let out once a day. Twenty-four to
forty-eight hours after hatching, according to the species, the hens
and their nurslings are placed in coops with wired runs. The run has
no bottom and is moved several times daily on turf. Needless to say,
the rearing-ground must be changed every year and protected from
harmful germs. Four or six times a day the chicks must have fresh
ants' eggs 1 and a custard made of biscuits, and a cake composed of
egg and milk cooked together. Soon dried ants' eggs, dried flies,
a little minced raw meat, and millet can be added. It is most important
that no stale food be left lying about the pheasantry.
Under favourable conditions (particularly absence of birds of prey)
the chicks can be allowed to run loose after a fortnight or so, teaching
them to feed and sleep in their coop at first, later in an enclosure.
This is the best way but it is often impracticable. They can be left
in the coop until they are about six weeks old, then be placed in
enclosures after the style of the aviaries of grown birds such as were
described earlier, but as roomy as possible.
If the weather is mild and dry during the rearing season the sitting
hen may be placed under a tree or a clump and allow the chicks freedom
when they are from seven to ten days old.
Little by little the fresh ants' eggs and the cake should be diminished,
then the insects and raw meat, and when the birds are about three
months old they should be put on to adult diet.
If convenient, several species can be reared together under one
hen provided they are of the same size. But it is better to keep the
species separate.
At the end of autumn the young birds should be paired off into
separate compartments. There are, however, certain necessary
precautions which will be named when the species for which they are
required are described in detail.
Diseases .--Only the most serious and common can be named here,
but it must be confessed that Pheasants are subject to several serious
and contagious diseases. At birth the chicks may contract diphtheria,
which scourge is very hard to cure by the usual methods. It is never-
1 Ants' eggs are not indispensable ; their place can be taken by adding an egg
and a glass of milk per every six chicks to the custard cake daily.

theless easily prevented by adding to the drinking water 0'25 per cent
of corrosive sublimate, which is perfectly harmless to the Gallinacse
in the strength prescribed of one quarter of a gramme to one and three-
quarter pints of water (35 fluid oz.). This must be given in a glass
or earthenware vessel, not in a metal one. We have used this prescrip-
tion for several years and are no longer troubled by the diphtheria
which formerly destroyed our broods. It should be used as a pre-
caution during transport and whenever an epidemic is to be feared.
When an adult Pheasant contracts the typical form of this disease
with patches in the mouth, it can be cured by washing them with
1 per cent of corrosive sublimate. There are also vaccines against
avian diphtheria which renders them immune for at least one year ;
if it is to be employed for a sick bird it must be repeated thrice in three
days, and each injection must be made under the skin of the cheeks.
Sometimes a brood is attacked by a contagious epidemic which
kills them off in three or four days. The liver will be found to be
covered with yellowish-white spots ; this disease is generally known
as tuberculosis of the liver, but it is caused by a form of Bacterium
avisepticum, which is a kind of poultry cholera. In localities which
have become infected with this disease, adult birds must be immunized
every year and the young at ten days old with Pascal's anticholera
vaccine. A quarter of a centimetre cube is injected into the breast
and after ten to fifteen days the operation is repeated, this time injecting
the half of a centimetre cube. The third injection is given at the age
of a month and a half with a centimetre cube. The Euplocomia are
more subject to this disease than other kinds.
It often happens that the young seem rheumatic and move badly ;
they may even be unable to stand. Usually the cause is rickets owing
to insufficient mineral salts ; crushed shells or, better still, phosphate of
chalk must be added to the diet. Sometimes, however, the disease
may be due to lack of sun, particularly of the ultra-violet rays.
Various forms of intestinal disease, usually called enteritis, may
attack both old and young. Nearly all these diseases can be averted
by giving the chicks milk acidified with ferments such as kefir
every day in their custard. Occasionally a rare adult bird such
as a Tragopan or a Monaul becomes dangerously ill and the

droppings suddenly become flabby, white, or greenish. It is then
necessary to act immediately, and we have made immediate cures by
cramming the bird with a bacteriological ferment like that prepared
by Professor Mezzadroli at Boulogne. These immunizing vaccines,
ferments which disinfect the intestines, and corrosive sublimate,
are superseding all other medicines in Pheasant therapeutics.
Numbers of young birds are killed by gape worms, which lodge
in the trachea and cause death by suffocation. Adults like Versicolors
and Monauls also succumb to it occasionally.
Experiments have been made in the zoological laboratory of the
University of Bologna which, added to what was already known of
the gape worm ( Syngamus trachea) have enabled us to make out its
life history. When full-grown Syngamus fix themselves in the trachea
of an adult Pheasant; it spits frequently to get rid of it, but without
success ; the eggs of the worm, however, reach the mouth, are mingled
with the saliva, and expelled with the excrements. A quarter of an
hour of sunshine will kill them, but they live a long time in dampness.
Earthworms coming to the surface to feed on the droppings of the
Pheasants eat the eggs of Syngamus, which hatch out in the intestines
of the worms. The birds are infected by eating the worms ; it takes
only about ten days for the Syngamus larvse to travel from the intestine
to the trachea and become adult.
It is readily understood that the parasite is more common in wet
seasons and places, as it has no opportunity to complete its life cycle
when drought prevents the earthworms from coming to the surface
and being eaten by the birds. It is easy to comprehend also why
such species as Lojphophorus , Crossoptilon, and Game Pheasants,
which are always digging in the earth, are more readily infected than
other kinds.
The only really effective way of combating this plague is to isolate
sick birds, change the breeding-ground, choosing the most arid and
sunniest spot possible, and prevent the birds from eating earthworms.
We do not yet know how long the larva of Syngamus can exist
in the earthworm, but one of us has proved that infection is still possible
after a whole year has elapsed ; it may perhaps take two years for
the earthworms in an infected spot to become safe.

Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
All medicines, inhalations, and injections in the trachea are useless
or too dangerous. Garlic is the only remedy which gives good results,
because it kills the larvse in the intestine and prevents their migration.
If the application is prompt and the Syngami are not sufficiently
numerous to kill the bird, they will die in twenty days and the bird
wfill be cured.
The legs are often attacked by scab : they must be anointed once
a week with Helmerich's pomade until cured.
Other diseases, like colds, coughs, gout, etc., can often be cured
by keeping the bird dry and warm and giving it a nourishing and
varied diet.
Peafowl
The genus Pavo is distinguished by its tail, consisting of twenty
graduated rectrices, covered by very numerous and enormously
elongated subcaudal feathers, with silky separated barbs except at
the preapicals which are adorned with brilliant " eyes ", and its head
bearing a rigid crest, and its size. The cock has short spurs and the
hen also in the species P. muticus. The cocks have the habit of
spreading their trains in a magnificent circle to charm their mates--
their display. Peafowl inhabit the wooded parts of India, of Indo-
China, Malaya, and Java. They usually frequent the borders of woods
or denuded ground in pairs or families. They are polygamous. Pea-
fowl may be kept in pairs or a cock with two hens in large aviaries,
but they show their beauty far better at liberty in a large park or
garden. There four or five hens can be allotted to one cock ; they
are not much inclined to stray. Unfortunately, the cocks are com-
bative ; all the same, a number of cocks of the common species can
be kept together if the worst tempered are weeded out, but this is not
possible with Pavo muticus , for adult cocks will fight to the death even
if kept in a large park.
Cocks, however, usually confine themselves to one spot where
they display and from which they do not wander far. In the park
in Bologna belonging to one of us, several white Peacocks are established
about 100 yards apart and two muticus were only about 400 yards
from them. The Peahen seeks the cock in spring in the place where

lie habitually displays, so that there is genuine sexual selection. We
(Ghigi) noticed that for two years the white Peahen's eggs were all
clear : they did not seek their cocks, but remained in adoration in
front of an aviary in which was a hybrid cock. We were obliged to
remove this cock out of sight before the hens would go in search of
their lawful mates.
Peahens make their nests under a bush or in some sheltered spot
and lay five to eight eggs ; they usually start laying in April. If
the eggs are taken away they will lay twice or thrice in the course of
the summer. It is best to take the first and second clutches and
allow the Peahen to hatch the third, unless it is in an unsafe place.
Incubation lasts from twenty-eight to thirty days. Peahens make
good mothers, and take the greatest care of their little ones.
Broods which are not left to their mothers can be reared by a
Turkey hen. A domestic hen is only to be chosen as a last resource,
for she will leave the chicks too soon before they are fully reared.
In any case it is best to shut up the chicks with their mother whether
she be Peahen, Turkey hen, or Hen, in a large coop in a well-sheltered
aviary. After eight days the chicks can be let out, but their mother
should be kept in for forty-five to sixty days according to the climate
and the season, for the dangerous age for Peachicks is between twenty
days to a month and a half old, by fatigue caused by following their
mother either in wet grass or hot sun. When their crests are well
developed the mother can safely be let out.
Peachicks grow slowly. At six months they have not attained
their full size and are not full grown until the end of the winter following
their birth. The cocks do not gain their adult trains before their
third year ; the hens lay when two years old. The old birds lose
their trains in July, and the next is not fully grown before the end of
the following winter ; thus they have a real eclipse like the rest of the
Phasianidse.
The Common Peacock (P. cristatus) is a native of India and Ceylon ;
it has been naturalized in Europe for very many years.
The Romans were familiar with its habits, of which Columella
gave the earliest account; they considered it both ornamental and
a good bird for the table. The earliest and very pretty pictures of

Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
Peacocks appear in the Pompeian frescoes. But since Turkeys were
discovered Peacocks have lost their rank as birds for the table.
Adult cocks are known by their showy crests, royal blue heads and
necks, which have two bare white spots above and beneath the eyes,
and by the wing-coverts and tertiaries being grey streaked with black.
The train is adorned with the splendid ocelli which are so well
known.
The hen is greyish-brown above; tawny-white beneath with
neck and upper breast tinged with metallic green. The young cocks
resemble her, but their necks are bluer ; their underparts are streaked
with black, while the hen's are uniform in colour. In their second
year they take the adult plumage minus the train.
The common Peacock is absolutely hardy in Europe and stands
cold well.
This species has " sported " the White Peafowl, a pure breed
recessive which conducts itself in the same manner, but the chicks are
not so easily reared. If an ordinary Peacock crosses with a White
Peahen all the cocks will be blue with a few white flights. These half-
breeds will give one quarter pure blues, one quarter pure whites,
and the remainder hetero-zygotic blues like the first generation. If
a half-breed is crossed with a pure white the young will be 50 per cent
pure whites and 50 per cent blues not pure.
A pied or variegated variety is actually in existence having a
tendency towards variegation. As blue is dominant over white the
result is that crosses between a variegated bird and a white one will
only produce variegated, which are very pretty ; but if on the contrary
a variegated bird is crossed with a pure blue, blues will result which
in the next generation will produce blues with white spots which are
not at all pretty. Variegation, therefore, is a pure characteristic
but variable in its intensity.
Besides these a mutant has suddenly appeared in semi-freedom
in Europe ; this is The Black-shouldered Peacock (Pavo cristatus
nigripennis). The cock differs from the type in having a more golden
back, more purple tail, dark blue wings shading into green, while the
hen is creamy white with brown spots above and rust-coloured head,
black crest, and metallic green neck ; her flight feathers are rust colour.

The chicks are creamy white. This mutant is constant; in a mixed
flock it soon gains the upper hand over the common kind. However,
it is much handsomer and equally hardy.
The Javan or Spicieer Peacock (Pavo muticus ) is perhaps the
most beautiful bird in the whole world. It inhabits Indo-China,
Java, Siam, and Malaya, and a slightly duller form (P. m. spiciferus)
is found in Burma.
It may be known by its height, its legs being much longer than
those of the Common Peacock : its head is adorned with an upright
spike-shaped crest; the skin of its face is bright blue and ochre-
yellow ; its neck, back, and breast are covered with green feathers
having gilt edges, giving a scaly appearance. Its wings are dark blue
shading into green, and the flights are rust colour. Its train is more
bronze and purple than that of the common species.
The hen is like the cock except that her tail is short, the upper
coverts scarcely reaching the end of the rectrices : these are bronzed
green tinged with brown and streaked with tawny, as are likewise the
back and wings.
The Spicifer is vastly more beautiful than any of the forms of the
common Peacock, but unluckily it is not as hardy and needs protection
from cold and snow in exposed situations, but only in the depth of
winter. It is exceedingly bad-tempered, and drives away its con-
geners. These birds become very tame and inclined to attack their
owners : they are actually dangerous to children. In spite of these
failings it is the finest ornament for a park.
The sexes are not easy to distinguish up to the age of from two to
three years ; the most constant character is the colour of the primary
flight-feathers, which are entirely grey in the cocks and more or less
widely edged with black in the hens.
The Argus Pheasants
We intend to include in this chapter the true Argus and the
Kheinardts, which differ in not having spurs in either sex. The first
are remarkable for their long central rectrices and the extraordinary
development of their secondaries. The second have a particularly
long and wide tail and a thick occipital crest.

180 Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
These birds inhabit the great forests of the Malay Peninsula, of
Borneo, Sumatra, and Indo-China. The cocks are sometimes heard
calling, but are very rarely seen, for at the least sound they hide in
the thickest jungle which they never leave. They feed on seeds,
but more especially on berries and insects. The cocks have a special
display which exhibits the wonderful patterns of their feathers ; for
this they choose a bare place in the midst of the forest.
They are considered to be polygamous, but appear in captivity
to be monogamous. They are somewhat delicate and for the
first year after their importation they should be under cover by night
and be kept in a warmed place during cold weather ; but once
acclimatized they can stand our winters provided they are shut up
at night in an unheated shelter. Aviary specimens require careful
feeding ; corn and custard are not enough, they must also have fruit,
cooked vegetables, and chopped meat; They are very fond of meal-
worms and prefer them to everything else. They are inclined to breed.
The hen usually lays two eggs three times a year, if they are removed ;
she makes an excellent mother. Incubation lasts from twenty-four
to twenty-five days, but there is no hard and fast rule.
In Bologna a hen laid at the end of July and in the first half of
September ; another laid in March while she was still in her winter
quarters.
The young can be reared successfully under a Domestic Hen,
provided she will feed them from her beak for the first few days and
take care of them for a long time. Young Argus take a whole year
to develop and their foster-mother must be at least six months with
them. They live on the usual Pheasant mixture with extra meal-
worms, insects, and chopped raw meat added. In damp or cold
places it is better to shut up young birds in a heated place from the
end of September.
Owing to their size Argus need a large flight and good-sized shelter :
they like perching. In Italy they never leave their shelter except
before sunrise and after sunset; they do not like sunshine.
The moult is very weakening to the cock and he must be given
very nourishing food while it lasts. He begins to call in February
or March, and continues until July or even longer. Argus are con-
fiding birds and soon become tame.

The Great Argus (Argusiana argus) lives in the lower mountain
forests of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The skin of the head is
bare and blue and carries a short crest on the nape of velvety black
feathers. The neck and upper breast are chestnut. The rest of the
plumage is dark, vermiculated and dotted with several shades of
tawny ; the back and rump yellowish-tawny with dark brown spots,
and the long median feathers of the tail are black and chestnut, dotted
with white ; while the wonderful secondaries are marked with lines
and dots of varying shades of grey, tawny, and brown with splendid
ocellii. The primaries, which are of normal length, have an even more
complicated pattern in which tawny and rust colours predominate.
The two central tail feathers are very long, The legs are red and
without spurs.
The hen has a more uniform plumage, dark brown streaked and
barred with lighter shades ; her wings and tail are of the normal
length.
The young cock takes three years to assume his adult plumage.
This is the most freely imported species. It has been bred pretty
often in confinement.
Gray's Argus (Argus grayi) inhabits the interior of Borneo. It is
slightly smaller than the preceding. Its neck and breast are bright
orange red, the black in its plumage is more decided, and the dots
are white instead of tawny. It is imported, but not as freely as the
former species.
Bheinhardt's Argus ( Rheinardtius ocellatus) is found in the
Annam mountains. Its size, colouring, and voice are very similar
to the Argus, but it has a feathered head ornamented with a thick
occipital crest, normal wings, and an enormous graduated tail of which
the four median feathers may reach l'50m. and the outer ones only
0'28 m. These feathers are very wide, pointed, and marvellously
marked with bright rust colour, brown, and several shades of grey.
The remainder of the plumage is brown dotted and vermiculated
with tawny. Its beak is pink, legs brown, and without spurs.
The hen has a medium tail; her plumage is brown with black
bars on wings and tail.
This magnificent species has been imported by one of us (Delacour)

several times. Although it is found in fairly cold localities, it has
proved tender in Europe. It is very subject to diphtheria.
A hen has laid at Cleres and in Mr. Lewis 5 aviaries at Cookham.
At Hue with M. Jabouille a pair bred and a young one was reared up
to the age of six months.
An allied species, darker, with round white markings (R. nigrescens),
inhabits the central mountain ranges of Malaya. It is rare and has
never been imported alive.

them they have brown or grey feathers finely striated and on their
tails fine green or blue ocelli, with metallic brilliancy. The hens
are smaller and duller, and differ more or less from the cocks. The
cocks display like Peacocks and Argus ; but they usually carry two
short and sharp spurs.
These Pheasants never leave the forests. They are found in
Himalaya, Burma, Siam, the Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, Indo-
China, Borneo, and the island of Palawan.
They lay two creamy white eggs and incubation lasts twenty-one
days. Their voice is loud and rather unpleasing. The most freely
imported species (P. chinquis and P. germaini) are hardy and robust
when acclimatized.
The Malayan Peacock Pheasant is rare and more delicate. The
other species have not yet been imported.
The Chinquis is the first Pheasant to lay in the year. We give
the dates of three years' laying by an imported hen in Bologna. We
shall only give the day of the first egg, because the second is always

30th April, 15th May ; 1929 : 20th April, 6th May. In 1929 the laying
of all the Pheasants was profoundly affected by the exceptionally
severe winter.
It is tiresome to have to set a hen on just two eggs, but it is unavoid-
able unless one has two hen Pheasants laying simultaneously. The eggs
have this peculiarity, if they are mixed with others in a sitting they
hardly ever hatch. The chicks also need quite different treatment,
for they always keep with the hen, making very short and quick runs
round her. The first brood usually hatches towards the end of March
if fresh ants 5 eggs are unobtainable mealworms may be given. Much
space is not necessary for them, a coop and small run are quite enough.
All the broods may safely be put together as soon as the latest no longer
need the hen.
Imported Peacock Pheasants are very strong ; even the Germains,
stand the winter of Bologna, which is very cold, without being shut in.
The Pheasants breed freely and regularly at a year old. With one of us-
(Ghigi) a pen of one cock and two hens had all the eggs fertilized.
The Grey Peacock Pheasant (P. chinguis) is from farthest south
and the hardiest. It is often seen in aviaries. It is found from Sikhim to&amp;gt;
Tonkin. There are four sub-species, which become browner according
as one advances eastward. (P. bailyi, P. bakeri, P. bicalcar atwm y
P. ghigii.) The cock is greyish brown, with pale tawny spots, and the
wing coverts adorned with changeable blue-purple ocelli, bordered with
black and white. The tail bears larger ocelli with blue and green
reflections. The head bears a pointed crest, the chin is white, and the
bare skin of the face pale yellow. The iris is white. The hen is much
smaller and her plumage is darker ; her ocelli are dark and unfinished,
and have no reflections. This is an admirable aviary bird, tame, hardy,,
and very elegant.
Germain's Peacock Pheasant (P. germaini) is a native of Cochin
China and the South of Annam. It is dark brown with green ocelli.
It has a very small crest, the skin of its face is red and its iris is brown.
While the cock is smaller than the preceding species, the hen is much
larger. The only difference between her and the cock is that her green

ocelli are triangular instead of round. This species is slightly more
delicate and needs a warmer shelter for the winter, although it can do
without heat. It is easily bred.
The Malayan Peacock Pheasant (P. malaccensis) is chestnut-
brown with blue ocelli, but the lateral rectrices bear only one very large
ocellus, whereas the preceding species have two. It has a thick crest,
and the skin of its face is red. The hen is much smaller than the cock ;
her ocelli are triangular, particularly those on the tail, which are
metallic. This fine species is seldom imported, and appears to be delicate.
It has not yet been bred in captivity. It inhabits the lowlands of Malaya
and Sumatra.
We will mention briefly P. katsumatce from the island of Hainan,
which is like Germain's, only smaller and paler ; P. schleiermakeri from
Borneo, very rare and very beautiful, having a white neck and breast,
and the crest and two spots on the side green, and a black belly. The
.splendid Napoleon Peacock Pheasant (P. emphanes) of Palawan,
which has a black head, neck, and breast, and metallic green mantle,
and a large straight black crest; P. chalcuras of Sumatra, which is
brown, with all the lateral rectrices largely metallic blue ; and lastly
P. inopinatum from the Malayan mountains, having reddish brown
plumage and black ocelli; its tail with blue markings and its head,
neck, and breast grey. The last two species, crestless, and with wide
metallic bands on the lateral tail feathers, are thought by many authors
to form a separate genus : Chalchurus .
THE PLUMED JAY, AND OTHER NOTES
By G. H. Gurney
The recent consignment of a number of specimens of the Plumed
or Swainson's Long-tailed Jay, Calocitta formosa, is of interest. They
were imported by Mr. G. B. Chapman, and sold as " new to aviculture ",
but Mr. Chapman forgot that he sold me a pair of this very fine species
in April, 1927. A coloured plate by Mr. Roland Green figured in the
Magazine for April, 1928, done from life from my birds, and I wrote
a short account of them, which was published at the same time. In

this account I said that the birds were then new to aviculture ; this
I now find is not the case, as apparently one or two had been imported
many years previously and found a home in one of the Continental
zoos. 1 It is a most desirable species, and my original pair, which I still
have, have done very well with me. I say " pair ", but I am inclined to
think they are two cocks ; in any case, they have never shown the
smallest desire to breed. When in good order they moult out into a
beautiful blue-grey colour, with a very long tail. The two new ones
which I have received from the recent consignment, and all those
which I have seen in Mr. Chapman's shop, have a much narrower black
band round the throat than my original pair ; in these the band is
broad and very conspicuous. I hope now that a number have found
their way to our aviaries someone may be lucky enough to breed them.
I believe that Jays could be much more easily bred in captivity if
aviculturists, who have woods adjacent, would wire in large flights,
enclosing small trees and bushes ; these enclosures could be very
roughly put up and merely used as summer breeding places ; the birds
would only be fed once a day, and otherwise would see nobody. All
Jays are very secretive, shy breeders, especially the Common Jay,
which breeds here commonly, but the experiment would be worth
trying with foreign species by those who have suitable woods. I have
done something of the same sort here this year for my Tiger Bitterns ;
a thick reed bed, with pools of water, was enclosed by wire-netting,
and although I cannot say there has been any success as far as breeding
goes, it has been a most wonderful experience to hear the loud echoing
booming of the male, which could be easily heard over a mile away,
very different from his booming in an aviary. This enclosure was made
by the river a considerable distance away, and, of course, it is rather
a trouble taking food down so far, but the mesh of the wire-netting is
wide enough for small fish to pass through, and I fancy they catch a
number of these in the pool in front of the reed bed.
It is rather early yet to speak of breeding results, but a number of

birds are nesting in tbe aviaries ; at the moment I have three pairs
of Superb Spreos, all in different aviaries and all sitting on eggs. A pair
of Scarlet Tanagers is sitting, and a nestful of Cardinals on the point of
flying. A pair of Lamprotornis pwpuropterus }1 do not know the English
name but they resemble a small Long-tailed Glossy Starling and came to
me from our member, Captain Hammond, have three or four eggs in
a log. He also sent me a very fine pair of Bald-headed Starlings,
Sarcops calvus , these birds have a very peculiar double note, and are
a very heavy flier, making quite a noise with their wings ; they are
constantly in and out of a hollow log, and may go further later on.
Another nice pair of birds recently received from Mr. C. B. Webb
are a pair of Helmeted Shrikes, Prionops talacoma, which he imported
from Portuguese East Africa, and which are quite new to aviculture.
They are charming little things, most un-Shrike-like in appearance, with
a very weak bill, and bright yellow naked skin round the eye ; they
have a hovering flight and constantly snap their beaks together
with quite a loud noise. A most superb Sunbird, the Malachite, is.
another recent arrival. I have never seen a bird in more lovely condition,
and it does the greatest credit to its owner, it is one of the largest of
the Sunbirds, if not the largest, and is a wonderful metallic green,
with two yellow tufts of feathers on the flanks ; the tail is much
elongated by two long feathers. It is very tame, and will readily take
flies from the fingers.
The Razor-billed Currassows are sitting, for the third year in
succession, on their accustomed two eggs, in the same place where they
have always nested, but I am afraid I have no reason to hope for better
luck this year than previously. The eggs are always unfertile, and yet
I am certain they are a true pair, and no bird could sit better or tighter
than the hen. Although they stray about terribly, and often go a mile
away or more, they always eventually return, and, as I say, have always
nested in a shed adjoining some of the aviaries. They are as tame as
Trumpeters and delightful birds in every way.
Many visitors to the Bird House at the Zoo must have noticed the
Guira Cuckoos, which from time to time have been on exhibition.
I believe there is one there now ; when I have seen these I have always

considered them rather dull looking birds, but a pair which now inhabits
one of my aviaries are, without exception, two of the most amusing
and interesting birds I have ever kept. Continually climbing about
in a most clumsy way in the boughs of a small bush in the outside flight,
they strongly remind one of that aberrant bird, the Hoatzin : there
seems to be something almost reptilian in their movements, and, like
the Hoatzin, they are very fond of eating leaves. They will lie on
their backs on the ground playing with each other, or with a bit of stick,
exactly like a pnppy or certain Parrakeets. The cock will often offer
the hen a piece of grass, standing before her with his crest erect,
motionless, for quite a long time ; in the same way they will each hold
a piece of meat in their beaks, their heads stretched fully upright to
the length of their necks, for ten minutes before eating it. They are
tremendous sun-lovers, and sit with their backs facing the sun, never
the other way, and all their feathers ruffled up to get as much warmth
as possible. Tamer birds it would be impossible to find ; directly
anyone goes into the aviary they will fly on to his shoulders, and
crawl about him, again forcibly suggesting a prehistoric lizard ancestry.
They often sit together in a flat basket, but although they are a certain
pair, I fear there is little chance of any breeding, as like all Cuckoos
they are parasitical, laying their eggs in other birds' nests. The cock
has a loud chattering whistle, when he does this his crest stands stiffly
erect, and his white eyes look quite malevolent. They would, of course,
be dangerous with smaller birds in the same aviary.
My six Demoiselle Cranes, which have always lived contentedly
in the garden and stood about in graceful attitudes, where they have
been much admired, now refuse to remain there, and easily jump a
six-foot fence into the Park, where they are only seen in the far distance ;
if one drives them back they are gone again in an hour's time, the
reason may be that amongst the long grass of the park they find a lot
of insects which they would not do on the closely-mown lawn, but they
were far more decorative in the garden and did no harm to the flower
beds.

About two months' ago Lord Tavistock was kind enough to send
a young hen Turquoisine, which he considered not quite robust enough
to use for breeding, to a friend of mine who was delighted to take
her as a pet. She was dreadfully shy at first, sat for days on a millet
spray at the top of her cage, and would not even come dowm to feed,
so that food and water had to be hung near her " upstairs " in order
that she should not starve. Her mistress--who would, I think, tackle
the taming of anything in feathers, from a Golden Eagle to a Humming
Bird--was determined to make friends with her, and would offer her
seeding grasses and all sorts of tit-bits, until she would nervously
nibble them from her hand, and even permit herself to be stroked with
a bit of grass.
My friend has some exceedingly tame Canaries, and she would
take one of these on her finger and show it to little Turquoisita whenever
she went near her cage. After a time she ventured to put her hand,
with a Canary in it, inside. The Canary was convinced that it was
being introduced into the den of some devouring green dragon, and
squeaked aloud; and Turquoisita, who had hitherto been dumb,
began to squeak also, in a minute, bat-like voice, and to make obvious
attempts to peck--whether at the hand of her mistress or at the
intruding Canary we could not quite make out.
It was nervous work letting her out for her first fly. The tame
Canaries all come out at lunch, and have a little table in the window
specially laid for them, with seed and water and green food, and a
cage upon which to perch. Turquoisita, however, when first induced
to leave the shelter of her own roof, shot up to the ceiling and hovered
under the picture rail like a distracted butterfly, much to my friend's
dismay. After several nerve-racking episodes of this kind, she seemed
to grasp the geography of the room, and soon became quite clever at
finding her way about.
It was after one of these harrowing early flights, when Turquoisita,
having fluttered down to the floor in a state of terror, had been caught
and returned to her cage by a mistress almost as perturbed as herself,

that she suddenly began to utter piteous cries, standing on the perch
with her wings lifted, and presenting the distressing appearance of a
lady in violent hysterics 1 My friend really thought that her pet's
last hour had come, that she had injured herself in some way, and was
about to have a fit, and did not dare even to approach the cage for
fear of making things worse. The piteous cries, however, continued,
and at last my friend, not knowing what to do, put her hand into the
cage and took out--a tame and unresisting bird w T ho snuggled into her
hand and allowed herself to be stroked and petted, squealing aloud
with joy during the process. She now does this whenever she wants to
be taken out or played with.
The dramatic moment had arrived--Turquoisita had suddenly
made up her mind to become a tame Turquoisine !
She bids fair at present to become a first class domestic tyrant,
for she has her own small ideas of what she likes and wants, and
insists on carrying them out. One of her fixed ideas is that it is the
duty of Albert, a sedate Belgian Canary of mature years and irreproach-
able behaviour, to feed her when she is out. She runs at him with her
beak open, and poor Albert misinterpreting her girlish playfulness
into a desire to tomahawk him, bolts as before a flaming fury. She
herself is fond of feeding anything in the room which attracts her--
including her owner's fingers ! A little Firefinch which lives with the
Canaries excites no particular interest in her, though he is not at all
afraid of her, and will even hop into her cage, so I suppose it is the
colour of the Canaries which intrigues her.
She was practically finger-tame in a month, but she has now
reached a stage which I might describe as ultra-tame. She will let
herself be stroked and handled even by strangers, but she knows quite
well the difference between them and the mistress who has taught her
to enjoy human society. Even when asleep she will answer to my
friend's voice when she calls her. She knows her step, and listens for
it, and will give her little quick " squeak ! squeak ! " when she enters
the room. It is pretty to see her little grey and turquoise mask and
bright eyes looking out between the fingers of her mistress as she plays
with her.
She has invented a funny little game for herself in her cage, which

I think she would play for hours, pedalling herself along the wires from
perch to perch with one little foot, while the other is firmly gripped
round one's finger. And she has developed such a taste for gaiety and
gadding about that now, when the Canaries' dining-table is being
spread, she climbs, squeaking, all over her cage, anxious to come out
and join in the fun.
Curiously enough, the heavy breathing which Lord Tavistock
had noticed in her from babyhood, has almost entirely disappeared
except when she is tired after a long fly, or unusually excited. At
other times she breathes quite normally, so I think it must have been
largely the result of nervousness.
We are now wondering whether, like the tame specimen mentioned
in Lord Tavistock's enthralling book on Parrots, Turquoisita will
develop talent for polite conversation !

For more than a quarter of a century London--chiefly Inner
London--has been my " parish of Selbourne ", and during that time
I have noted many birds there that I should certainly never have
expected to see in such a locality. Most remarkable of all was the
appearance of an Osprey over the Zoo ; I cannot say in what year,
or even if it turned up before or after the War, but the manner of its
occurrence is very vividly fixed in my memory. All the Eagles were
gazing upwards, a thing I have never seen them do before nor since ;
and on following their looks I saw the Osprey silhouetted against
the sky, too high up for the colours of its plumage to be visible, but
unmistakable in its unique combination of the narrow angular wings
of a sea-bird, with the longer tail and blunt bows of a bird of prey.
The Osprey ranges so widely, and is so very rare in captivity, that
there can be little doubt that the visit was that of a really wild bird,
and not due to the escape of a caged one.
The Peregrine I have also once seen over the Zoo, and again I
cannot fix the date ; the bird was flying low and westward, and passed
over the Gardens at the south entrance ; it certainly had no jesses or

bell. The only two Kestrels I ever saw in Regent's Park were, however,
" freedmen "--one I released myself after ransoming it for a shilling
from a bird shop where it had been thrust, as Browning says of another
Hawk, " into a coop for a vulgar Pigeon " ; and the other had escaped
from the Great Gull's aviary at the Zoo, and was perched on the Lion
House with a Sparrow in its claws. London Kestrels, I believe, depend
a good deal on Sparrows ; they are not uncommon, for I have noted
one at Westminster--frequently--and others in the City, in Cromwell
Road, South Kensington, at Forest Hill, over Lewisham High Road,
and, only this year, over a garden in Peckham Road but a few score
yards from Camberwell Green. I have only once seen two together,
and that was at Wandsworth Common. At Plumstead Wood, which
is getting rather far out, I once saw one sailing in great spirals on
motionless wings like a Buzzard, though it did at last hover a moment.
The Brown Owl is, I take it, quite common in London, as birds of
prey go ; it is true that I have only actually seen it at the north of
Regent's Park, and that I have heard of birds being released from the
Zoo, so that the bird I once saw in the Gardens, and the single birds
I saw on two different occasions, one on Primrose Hill and one in a
garden in Albert Road, may have been one pair and ex-captives at
that; but before the War I have heard the unmistakable hooting
in St. James' Park, and since that within the last few years, on more
than once occasion in King's Cross Road, of all places, to say nothing
of Honor Oak and Forest Hill, and I have reliable information of the
birds breeding now at Dulwich, so that I think the species is quite
established as a Cockney.
Among fish-eating birds I have noted the Great Crested Grebe,
not only in the river off Richmond, which is not surprising, but in
Regent's Park, and even in one of the basins at the west end of the
Serpentine--where, I was told, it had been for days--it succeeded in
flying out, and it went off down the lake as I watched it. The Cormorant
I once saw on a very cold winter's day during the War, on the river
just below Westminster Bridge, over which it came flying low, and, as
a contrast, on a beautiful September evening a few years ago one
flew north very high over Cavendish Square ; that the birds were the
Common Cormorant, and not the Shag, I am sure ; but they may have

been one and the same, and even tbe same specimen that created so
much Press humour recently by sitting on Big Ben ! For the single
Heron that has appeared in Inner London--I saw it once over the
Zoo--I may be responsible, as about 1890 I gave a clip-winged yearling
to St. James' Park on condition that it should not be pinioned--this
would make the bird pretty old, but the locality is safe, and the species
long-lived.
Among the Winter Gulls during the present century, I have noted,
first, the advent of the Herring Gull in considerable numbers before the
War--I once counted a couple of dozen settled for the night on the
ice in St. James' Park ; and, since the war, the increasing numbers
of the Common Gull which is now much more numerous than the
Herring Gull is now or ever was in London, though, as everyone
knows, its name is misleading, for both the Herring and Black-headed
species are really more abundantly and widely distributed about our
islands ; in fact, before I met with it in London, the only locality in
which I had seen it wild was along the Crinan Canal on a twelve-days
trip in the Highlands about 1890. Here we have the rather unaccount-
able phenomenon of the weaker species increasing apparently at the
expense of the stronger ! and that, be it noted, in the case of two&amp;apos;
natives ; so that one should be careful in condemning a prosperous alien
animal when an indigenous ally seems to give place to it locally.
[Herons have, on many occasions, been seen flying over the Zoological
Gardens, apparently on their way to the lake in Begent's Park. On
7th June this year, one was seen from the Keeper's Lodge flying round
and settling on the Great Aviary in the early morning. The Brown
Owl is common as a wild bird in the neighbourhood of Begent's Park
and Hampstead.-- Ed.]
THE BARBARY DOVE AT LIBERTY
By W. H. Workman
During the last few years a great deal has been written about
liberating various species of foreign birds so that they may fly about
and give to our gardens an added and exotic charm. This new avicul-
ture, I am sure, will progress as experiments are made from time to

time, finding out the best types for the purpose and those birds which
are content to stay about the place where they are fed.
I want to describe a very simple experiment which I made by way
of a start and which I am glad to say has been entirely successful,
because it requires a certain amount of nerve to let out for the first
time a number of birds, hoping against hope that they will have the
sense to stay, even though they are such common birds as the Barbary
Dove (Streptopelia risoria).
I live within thirty minutes 5 walk of the centre of a city having a
population of about half a million, so town dwellers need not be dis-
couraged. I have a garden of about half an acre in a quiet avenue ;
there are some old Scotch firs, etc., and, in the neighbouring gardens
there are a number of large trees of various species, so that the locality
is fairly suitable.
Well to make a start I got a very tame breeding pair of Barbarv
Doves about May, 1928. They did splendidly and by September I had
about four pair of beautiful young birds which I reared on crumbled
household white bread, together with a good supply of cuttlefish bone
well ground up and grit, till they were able to pick the ordinary dove
mixture for themselves. Just as soon as the young had left the nest
the hen started off again on another brood, so I had no difficulty in
getting my flock together. As they got older I transferred them to a
small aviary and there they stayed all winter, living on cracked maize,
oats, dari and No. 3 biscuit meal.
Tn the spring of 1929 I transferred a pair to a small cage hanging
under a tree so that they could get their bearings. After about a week
the front was opened and out flew the Doves as they did from the Ark :
round and round they flew out of sight and then back again to light
nearby in the Scotch firs. They had made up their minds to stay so all
was well and next week another pair was liberated and so on till I had a
flock of eight doves coming down every morning before breakfast to be
fed. They are so tame that they swoop down all round me and one
must see them, to realize what a pretty sight it is to have a flock of
these little doves at liberty in one's garden where they are quite harm-
less to the plants, not like some of the larger-legged fraternity which
I could name.

Avicultural Notes
Up to date I have liberated about ten birds and I think they are
all about as I have seen the whole lot together once during the winter,
but they usually come about in a flock of six or eight. They are early
risers and they begin to gather in my garden after dawn as I hear them
cooing from 5 a.m. on.
In the evenings after they have been fed I see them flying across
the adjoining tennis courts with very rapid flight, always in pairs, to
some large yew-trees several hundred yards away from my garden,
where they invariably roost and where I think the attraction is the
thick cover of the Irish yew-tree.
I have not found these birds interfered with by either cats or Hawks,
of both of wdiich we have a number, the latter so bold that I have seen
a Sparrowhawk jumping up and down on the top of the aviary flight
simply mad with anger at not being able to get inside and have a go at
all the dainty little morsels safe within. In conclusion I can recommend
this first experiment because by so doing you will have added a great
charm to your garden, interesting both to its owner and his visitors.

Mr. C. S. Webb is a master in the art of collecting and bringing home
his collection in first-rate condition. He arrived home from Portuguese
East Africa in May with a moderate though very choice collection,
containing several birds new to aviculture and almost every bird was
in such condition as to render it eligible as a prize-winner in keen
competition.
In his collection were examples of Smith's Helmet-Shrike (Prionops
talacoma), of which I am able to give a photograph. A pair were
acquired by Mr. Gurney, who refers to them on page 184.
There were three examples of the African Pigmy Goose (Nettapus
auritus ), one of the most beautiful of the smaller Waterfowl though
none too easy to keep. These, I understand, went to Mr. Delacour,
who had previously had one brought by Mr. Webb from Madagascar
last year.

There was one example of the tiny Barbet known as the Tinker Bird
(Barbatula pusillus), with scarlet forehead and head streaked with
black and yellow. It is said to derive its trivial name from its loud and
monotonous note which has a metallic ring and resembles the tapping
of a hammer upon an anvil.
There was a pair of the fine African Wattled Plover ( Lobivanellus
lateralis) and two examples of the Natal Kingfisher ( Ispidina natalensis) y
a perfect gem of a bird with ultramarine upper surface, the crown being
barred with black, the sides of the face rufous washed with lilac, and
coral red bill and feet. It is principally an insect feeder found mostly
in the bush often far from water, so should not be difficult to keep in
captivity.
The Tinker Bird, Wattled Plovers and Kingfishers were acquired
by Mr. Ezra, and many of us saw and admired them at Foxwarren Park
on 31st May.
All of those above mentioned appear to be new to aviculture in this
country, but there were others in the collection nearly as rare but not
quite new to aviculture, such as the White-shouldered Robin Chat
(Cossypha humeralis), of which a photograph is here reproduced, the
Southern Grey-headed Bush Shrike (Laniarius starki), the Green-
necked Touraco ( Gallirex chlorochlamys), African Jacana ( Actophilus
africanus ), Black Crake ( Limnocorax niger), and several Sunbirds.

Sir, --Mr. Roland Green's beautiful and precise drawings of
Touracos well show what I have often observed in the actual birds,
that though the outer toe in these is reversible, it is in practice usually
turned back in the red-winged species, and stands out at a right-angle
to the middle one, or even comes forward in the others.
These also have longer tails and a generally more graceful form,
and appear to show themselves more in the open and to be more-
addicted to feeding on leaves and less on fruit.

Hence I should be disposed to divide the family into two genera
only, one to include all the red-winged species and the other for what
may be called the plain-winged ones.

ARTICLES ON THE COMMONER BIRDS WANTED

Sir, --Several members of the Society here have expressed a desire
that The Avicultural Magazine should contain information on the
keeping and breeding of the more common birds kept by aviculturalists.
You will admit, of course, that while you have many breeders
keeping rare species, details of which are of interest to all, information
concerning the keeping and breeding of the more common species
would be of more practical use to a great number of members.
I suggest that each Magazine contain an article on the keeping
and breeding of one common bird.
Some time ago a most interesting article was given on the breeding
of Avadavats. More articles of this description would be highly
appreciated here. Do you think my request at all possible ?
With kind regards,
The Avicultural Society of New Zealand.
G. Rowland Hutchinson,
Hon. Secretary.
[We print this letter in the hope that members will come forward
and help us with accounts of their birds, however common they may
consider them. Many members keep Waxbills, Grassfinches, and such-
like. Let us have their experiences of successes and failures. --Ed.]

The Golden and Amherst Pheasants
The strong resemblance between Chalcurus and the hens of the
well-known Golden and Lady Amherst's Pheasants (genus Chrysolophus)
determines us to take them next in order. They are unquestionably
the most beautiful of the family, both in shape and colour. In addition,
they are perfectly hardy and always ready to propagate their species.
They are above all others the best suited to aviary life, and only the
ease with which they are bred and increased prevents them from being
appreciated at their real worth.
They are found in West China and the neighbouring countries
of Burma and Tibet; they live in the rocky mountains among bushes
and bamboos. They are polygamous, each cock mating with
three to four hens.
The Golden Pheasant (C . Rictus) is spread over the whole of
North-West China. It is too well known to need a detailed
description of its splendid colouring of gold, red, yellow, blue, green,

Lady Amherst's Pheasant (C. amherstice) replaces the Golden
further west on the confines of Tibet and Burma. The cock is equally
well known with his blue, green, white, grey, and orange plumage.
Pure-bred individuals (they are rare) not crossed with the Golden
Pheasant have no red either on the flanks or the abdomen
Hybrids between the two species are extremely beautiful. It is
only recently that the remarkable gametic affinity has been detected
between these and the Common Pheasant; in their hybrids
the cocks are fertile and the hens sterile.
The True Pheasants
These include all the long, narrow-tailed species with heads adorned
with wattles more or less well developed. They consist of the genera
Phasianus , Syrmaticus, and Catrceus. The genus Phasianus, which
has been naturalized as a game-bird all over Europe, in the wild state
frequents open spaces intersected by bushes and tall grass. The rest
mostly inhabit woods and copses. They are polygamous, hardy,
and easily reared. The sexes are quite unlike. Their food is the same
as that of other Pheasants ; they lay about a dozen eggs and incubation
lasts twenty-four days. It is better to allow two to four hens to
every cock.
The Common Pheasants ( Phasianus)
Birds in this genus have narrow tails of medium length ; the cocks
have tapering silky rump feathers, large red wattles round the eyes,
and two little tufts of erectile feathers each side of the nape. The
cock utters the well-known short harsh crow. The Pheasants in
preserves throughout Eurppe all belong to this genus and are almost
always hybrids from several varieties.
They are found from the Caucasus to Japan, and from thence to
tropical Burma and Tonkin.
More than thirty distinct varieties are known. It has been
absolutely proved that all these Pheasants are fertile inter se ; con-

sequently, the purity of any race is in direct ratio to its geographical
isolation; the Pheasants of Japan ( versicolor ) and of Formosa
(formosanus) are naturally more distinct from the rest because they
live on islands and cannot interbreed with other adjacent forms.
All these Pheasants are remarkably uniform morphologically ; their
plumage is always metallic ; the neck is green ; the wing-coverts
have chestnut streaks. The chief differences are grouped round the
following characteristics : They may or may not have a white collar
round the neck, which is dominant in the hybrids ; the back and rump
may be either green or chestnut. There are, therefore, four categories
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.819270571428571" page_id="56211694"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
of the Common Pheasant:--
1. Without collar, rump chestnut.
2. With collar, rump chestnut.
3. With collar, rump green.
4. Without collar, rump green.
All the Western forms have chestnut rumps, and all the Oriental have
green ones.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.997955388888889" page_id="56211694"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
The collar is most frequent among the forms which inhabit Central
Asia, while those without it are outside the centre of distribution
of the genus.
We are dealing with a genuine species divided into systematized
varieties, which in their turn include several local races and forms.
In certain cases it is difficult to establish the genuine systematic worth
of each form, but it seems to us desirable to subdivide them into six
species, each including several races.
The first are the Pheasants belonging to the Colchicus race, the
earliest known and the only wild species in Europe (the Caucasus).
All Pheasants included are deep coppery red with head (except on
top where it is bronze) and neck green with purple reflections ; the
back, sides, and tail are perceptibly the same shade ; no white collar.
The Common Pheasant (P. c. colchicus ) inhabits the Caucasus
bordering on Persia. It has no white collar ; the middle of the
abdomen is greenish black.
The Northern Pheasant (P. c. septentrionalis), which is found
further north, has a chocolate brown abdomen, and is rather deeper red.

200 Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
On the south-western and south-eastern shores of the Caspian Sea
are two related forms-- P. c. talischensis and P. c. persicus.
The Prince of Wales Pheasant (P. c. principalis) is the second
species. The cock is slightly smaller and all his upper parts are brilliant
tomato red, without either black or yellow marks on the scapulars.
His throat is chestnut, as are also the terminal spots on the chest and
sides. The middle of the wing is white. The median rectrices have
no black bars.
The hens have their flight feathers evenly striped yellow and brown
and are lighter than the hens of Colchicus. The chicks have chestnut
spots on their shoulders. They are found in South-Eastern Turkestan,
bordering Persia and Afghanistan. This is a handsome Pheasant
well known in confinement. .
The various regions and oases of Turkistan are the home of several
intermediate races, among some of which the white collar appears--
P. p. zarudnyi, zerafshanicus, bianchii, chrysomelas, turcestanicus .
The Mongolian Pheasant (P. c. mongolicus), from Kirghir to
Dzungaria and the Chinese province of Kulaia, comes next. A bird
which is very widely distributed in preserves and Pheasant-rearing
establishments. It is large, pansy-coloured or deep mauve glossed
with green, has a white collar and white in the wings.
The hen has her flight feathers barred like the former species,
but is duller and has little green spots on her back ; the chicks have
distinct markings.
Further south, in West Chinese Turkestan, Shaw's Pheasant
(P. c. shawi) is to be found ; it has no collar.
We now come to the Pheasants of the species torquatus, distinguished
by the different colouring of parts of its plumage. Upper back, more
or less orange-yellow ; lower back, greenish-grey, the point of the
wings chestnut, the rest light brown, the sides more or less pale yellow
with large black tips ; tail, greenish or brownish with black stripes.
The collar may be present or absent.
The Ring-necked Pheasant (P. t. torquatus) inhabits South-Eastern
China and North Tonkin ; still further north P. c. kiangsuensis , which
is slightly paler, and a darker form to the east of Tonkin (P. t.
takatsukasai).

The Corean Pheasant (F. t. karponi) is distinguished by having
deeper yellow flanks and rather lighter colouring.
Pallas&amp;apos; Pheasant, from North-Eastern Manchuria, has a very
wide white ring.
Hagenbeck's Pheasant (F. t. hagenbecki), to the extreme east of
Mongolia and separated from the above by over 2,000 kilometres, is,
notwithstanding, exceedingly like it, the only distinction being the
wider black edges to its breast feathers.
The Formosan Pheasant ( P. formosanus) is very distinct. It is
very pale ; the yellow on the middle of its back is the same shade as
the scapulars, uniformly straw-coloured without any black. The
flanks also are very light. The hens and chicks are very light, almost
white. Other forms may be found in the interior of China, which
approach more nearly to Colchicus according as one goes westward.
The Ringless Pheasant (P. t. decollatus), found south of the
Yang-Tse to Kuang-Si, is like the Ring-neck, but has no collar and is
rather darker.
The Elegant Pheasant, inhabitant of South-West China to
Upper Burma, and North-West Tonquin, differs from the preceding
in having a green band across the chest. No ring. Finally there are
races of Torquatus more and more closely intermediate between
Colchicus in North-West China and East Turkestan : P. t. strauchi ,
vlangalii , satschuensis, and tarimensis .
The Japanese Pheasant (P. versicolor) is a distinct species
having several forms not very highly differentiated (P. v. robustus ,
P. v. kinsinensis , P. v. tanensis. It is peculiar to Japan.
The cock is a fine dark green with tawny spots on the mantle ; his
wings are marked with pale tawny and chestnut; his head is metallic
purple ; he has no ring ; his tail is greenish tawny with black bars and
pale brown fringe. The hen is darker and more delicately mottled
than those of the other species.
The Yersicolor is a splendid bird, easily reared and a fine game-bird.
Let us finish by describing the Dusky Pheasant (P. colchicus mut.
tenebrosus ), which is purple with green reflections above and has red
marks on its flanks, and only offers a superficial resemblance to the
Versicolor. The hen is chocolate-brown with black marking.

This mutation has appeared for several years among preserved
birds in England. It is large and hardy and flies well; it is an excellent
table bird. There are also White Pheasants and Crested Pheasants.

Long-tailed Pheasants ( Syrmaticus)
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998332466666667" page_id="56211697"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
While the ordinary Pheasants make up a very homogenous group,
the Long-tailed Pheasants differ so much from one another that several
authors consider them to belong to separate genera. Beeves' Pheasant
has no erectile wattles on the neck ; but the cock has a very narrow,
naked red stripe above the eyes. Its eggs are greenish-grey while
those of the other species are pinkish-white or yellow, as in the case
of the Amherst. Besides this, it is not yet known if its hybrids are
fertile.
Elliot's, Hume's, Burmese, and the Mikado Pheasants have been
lumped together under the name of Calophasis ; they have sixteen
rectrices. Scemmerring's Pheasant, with its varieties, has been named
Gra&amp;apos;pho&amp;apos;phasianus ; they have eighteen restrices. Although the cock
has wattles round the eyes, the hen's head is practically all feathered.
Lastly, the toes are bordered with tiny scales arranged like the teeth of
a comb. The Mikado also has this last characteristic and was given
the generic name of Cyanophasis by Buturlin.
These long-tailed Pheasants are distinguished by the cocks not
having pointed feathers on the rump, but the median rectrices very
much prolonged, and the absence of tufts on the sides of the head.
Their voices also are very different to those of Phasianus, being more
of a whistle. Their plumage is very various. They have a peculiar
display, consisting of puffing out the feathers of the neck. The hens
have well marked plumage. Both sexes when running spread out
their tails like a fan. The long-tailed Pheasants inhabit Japan, China,
Formosa, and Burma. They live in the mountains and frequent
woods and thickets.
They do well in confinement and are easily reared, but they are
very combative and the cock often kills the hen. It is necessary
to take precautions against this, particularly with Soemmerriug's
Pheasant. All are hardy in France.

Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour -- Pheasants 208
Beeves' Pheasant (S. reevesi) inhabits the mountains of Central
China. It is a splendid bird, well known to everybody, with tawny
yellow plumage mottled with black, varied with white and brown,
and an enormous tail, reaching nearly 6 feet in length.
The hen's mantle is marked with white and black and the feathers
of her tail barred with russet and white.
This species does very well in confinement and as a game-bird at
liberty, but it is very combative, though the cocks do not often attack
their hens. It is the best stayer of all Pheasants, so that at liberty the
Beeves' Pheasant is the finest game-bird imaginable. Unfortunately
it is an extremely combative creature ; the cock will not tolerate his
own species nor the cocks of other kinds, so that it is not possible to
have as many as one would like in the coverts. Even the chicks begin
to fight each other when eight to ten days old, and they cannot be
reared along with other species ; they will even fight among themselves
while with their foster-mother.
Soemmerring's Pheasant (S. s. scemmerringi ) is a native of South
Japan ; the cock is deep copper red mottled with light red, and has
a very long reddish tail barred with dark brown. The hen is like the
Beeves, but is redder and her marking is different.
The Ijima Pheasant ( S . s. ijimce) from South Kiu-Siu, is known
from the preceding species by his silvery white rump.
Besides these there are in Japan two sub-species ( S . s. sub-rufus and
intermedins). These Japanese Pheasants are superb ; they live well,
and .are easily reared in aviaries, but they are so combative that it is
very hard to pair them off. Most cocks kill their hens in spring, and
if several hens are put together they fight among themselves. It is
necessary to have recourse to either very large aviaries thickly planted
with bushes, or a smaller one with two compartments, where the
sexes can be kept separate and only allowed to come together for a
short time, when they can be watched. This bad habit is a great
obstacle in propagating these fine birds.
Elliot's Pheasant ( S . ellioti ) inhabits the mountains of South-
East China, where it is rare. The cock is remarkably handsome :
the crown and sides of his head are light grey, black beneath ; the
upper chest and back are bright copper, the wing coverts blue-black

and white in two bands, the upper wing blue-black, the scapulars
form a white line, the middle and lower back ringed white and black,
the abomen is white, the sides ringed with red and black. The tail
is russet barred with pale grey with a narrow black line edging the grey ;
sub-caudals, black. The hen is light pale brown, streaked and mottled
with red and black ; the front of the neck is black ; the lateral feathers
of the tail are red, ending with black and white.
This handsome Pheasant does well both in aviaries and at liberty ;
it is perfectly hardy. The cocks are sometimes spiteful and it is
necessary to watch them and to give each several hens.
There is in Burma a species ($. humice) living among the high
mountains which has not yet been imported alive. They are rather
like Elliot's Pheasant above, only darker, and with the whole head
and neck black, the under parts mahogany brown, and light grey tail
barred with black and brown. The hen also somewhat resembles
the Elliot but is without the black throat.
To the west of the Irrawaddy the typical form occurs, which in the
east is replaced by a redder, lighter form (S. burmanicus). It is much
to be wished that this fine bird could be imported alive.
The Mikado Pheasant (S. mikado) belongs to the mountains
in the centre of Formosa. The cock is blue-black, but the feathers
on the back and chest have metallic tips ; the lower back is black
ringed with blue, as is the point of the wing, which also has white
stripes ; the tail is black barred with white. The hen is brown, with
black spots and mottled with whitish tawny. Her pattern is not as
well defined as those of the preceding species.
This noble bird was imported in 1912 and bred freely. It
disappeared later, but one of us (Delacour) has lately received a few.
In the aviary it behaves like Elliot's Pheasant, and with it breeds
very fine hybrids which are fertile and very much like S. humice.
The Cheer Pheasant ( Catreus )
This genus only contains one species ( Catreus wallichi), confined
to the Western Himalayas, w T here it lives at from 2,000 to 3,000 metres
high among rocky and steep woods.
This species differs from all others. Its long tail and tawny black-

barred plumage somewhat recall Reeves' Pheasant, although much
duller, but it has a tapering crest and its beak recalls the Crossoptilons,
which it also resembles in certain of its habits and its boldness. The
Cheei Pheasant, like Swinhoe's and the Pirebacks, is liable to be
attacked by pseudo-tuberculosis of the liver, which does not exist
among the true Pheasants. Its eggs are like the Crossoptilons but
very lightly spotted with brown, but the chicks, on the contrary, are
grey with dark marking like the Common Pheasant. Its voice is
unlike all other Pheasants, more like that of a Partridge. The hen is
like the cock save that her tail and crest are shorter and her plumage
is paler and more spotted.
The only specimen actually in European aviaries at present is a hen
recently acquired by one of us (Ghigi), but a few years ago it was not
uncommon ; it is hardy and, although subject to diphtheria, breeds
tolerably freely. It is to be wished that it might be re-introduced,
for, notwithstanding its rather dull plumage, it is an interesting bird.
The Kaleege and Allied Pheasants
Including the Pheasants belonging to the genera Gennceus,
Hierophasis, Diardigallus, Acomus, Lophura, and Lobiophasis. These
are distinguished by their ample and laterally compressed tails, like
those of domestic cocks, and all arched like them, except the Acomus,
where they are more like hens'. All are adorned with large velvety
lobes, which expand when the bird is excited. All are monogamous
and forest dwellers. The males of them all, except Acomus and
Lobiophasis, have well developed crests, and except in Diardigallus
and Hierophasis the hens also wear them.
These Pheasants are tropical birds, being found in the Himalayas,
Burma, Siam, and Indo-China ; in South China, Hainan, and
Formosa ; in the Malayan Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, and the
neighbouring islands.
The least southern species are perfectly hardy ; they live and breed
with us readily ; the Malayan are more susceptible to cold and
should have shelter in bad weather ; young birds are not easily
reared in the colder districts : they need special attention and careful
housing.

Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
The young of some species take eighteen months to acquire adult
plumage.
Incubation is from twenty-two to twenty-five days.
The Kaleege or Silver Pheasants
The Pheasants of the genus Gennceus , of which the Silver Pheasant
is the best known type, are found from Himalaya to Hainan and up
to the north of the Malayan Peninsula. The cocks are black and white ;
the hens wear crests. They are all quite hardy and easily bred.
Incubation lasts twenty-five days.
The White-crested Pheasant (G. hamiltoni), better known under
the name of albocristatus, is the most westerly ; it inhabits Kashmir
and the regions to the east. It is black with purple reflections, and
the feathers on the back are white edged. The breast feathers are
long and light grey, the crest is large and white, the lobes are red, and
the legs greenish-grey. The hen is olive brown with tawny streaks.
It is rather rare in confinement.
The Nepal Pheasant (G. leucomelanus) of Nepal is distinguished
from the former by a black crest. It is almost the only one found
commonly in confinement.
The Black-backed Kaleege (G. melanotus) of Sikkim and Bhutan
differs in having its back entirely black and a whiter breast. It is
rather rare in aviaries. Young cocks of these three species attain
their adult plumage in three months.
Horsfield's Kaleege (G. horsfieldi) inhabits Assam and Burma.
It is blue-black with white markings on the lower back. It is fairly
common in confinement.
In the south-east it is replaced by a sub-species having white-striped
plumage {F. h. williamsi). There are numerous crosses between
this species and the following :--
The Lineated Pheasant (G. lineatus) appears to be grey above,
its feathers being closely vermiculated with black and wdiite ; the body
is black with white-striped flanks and the lateral tail feathers are
vermiculated with white. This Pheasant comes from South Burma.

Further north is another sub-species (G. 1. oatesi) with coarser vermicula-
tion, and in the Shan and Siamese States yet another with regularly
barred plumage-- G. 1. sharpei.
These birds all have greenish-grey legs. The Lineated Pheasant
was at one time common in confinement, but now there are very few
pure-bred specimens. The young cocks behave like the Horsfields.
Lewis' Pheasant (G. lewisi) is confined to the mountains to the
south of Cambodia, where it was discovered by one of us (Delacour)
in 1927. Unlike the foregoing, but like the Silvers, it has bright red
legs. Its tail is rather short. The cock is black above with narrow
white lines rather far apart, and black underneath. The hen is
reddish brown, her feathers edged with tawny grey, and a reddish
tail. One pair has been brought alive to France (Delacour). It is
extremely rare.
All the following Pheasants may be looked upon as being sub-
species of the Silver Pheasant. The further south one goes the more
the white of their plumage is striped with black and the shorter are
their tails. Nevertheless, there are some very distinct forms. As
yet this group is not well known, and it is further complicated by
hybridization on the borders of distribution. They are all red-legged,
and the cocks of all assume adult plumage in their second year.
The Silver Pheasant (G. nycthemerus ) is a native of China and
Tonquin. It is the whitest bf all above, with narrow, widely spaced
streaks and very long tail. The hen is brown with whole coloured
breast.
Kippon's Pheasant (G. n. ripponi), which takes its place further
west and is found in Yunnan, in East Burma, Laos, and extreme
north of Annam, differs from the Silver in having broader black stripes.
The hen is very different, has her breast mottled with dark brown
and white. I do not know if it has been imported, but it is kept in
confinement in Indo-China.
The Bed-legged Pheasant (G. n. rufipes), inhabiting the district
between the Rivers Irrawaddy and Salween, has larger and closer
black stripes than the above. The hen's breast is mottled and redder
than the Silver.

208 Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--\0x25A0Pheasants
resembles the preceding; its tail is shorter and its plumage
more evenly barred. The ben's breast is one-coloured. It is
easily bred in confinement and bas several times been imported
(Delacour).
Bel's Pheasant {G. n. beli), found further south, is much darker,
and the black and white of its plumage nearly equally distributed.
It has been imported and bred in Prance.
The Annam Pheasant (G. n. annamensis), which inhabits the
Langbian mountain in South Annam, is very different. Its stripes
are much closer and give it a grey appearance. Its crest is very slender,
and on the sides of the neck and body are large white spots. The hen
is uniformly reddish brown. This handsome Pheasant has not yet
been imported alive.
The Hainan Pheasant (G. whiteheadi), from the mountains of
that island, is like a small Silver with widely separated but very
large stripes. The hen has neck and under parts of black brown,
with white spots. This species is rare and has not yet been brought
over.
One of us (Ghigi), having carried out a series of experiments in
hybridization on Mendelian principles between leucomelus, Lineated,
Horsfield's, and Silver Pheasants, that is to say taking the result of
the second generation and then recrossing, has obtained hybrids similar
to several of the species described above. These hybrids are lighter
or darker according as there is more Silver or more Horsfield blood
in them, and they correspond to the series found in the wild state in
the intermediate regions between the distribution of the most distinct
and widely differing species; Horsfield-Silver, Silver-Lineated,
Lineated-Horsfield.
This is a striking example of new species whose origin is the
hybridization of two antagonistic mutations. These Pheasants
settle in certain districts, and selection fixes a species, but it has always
been possible for incursions from outside to take place, because these
birds wander in the breeding season far from the place where they
were bred, especially their hens. It is this wandering instinct which
makes it impossible for us to use these Pheasants to replenish our
game preserves.

The cocks of Hierophasis have as their dominant colour note dark
metallic blue, a short crest and slightly arched tail, red wattles and
legs. The hens have a scarcely visible rudimentary crest. The blue
Pheasants are found in the mountains of Formosa and Central Annam.
They thrive in confinement.
Swinhoe's Pheasant ( H . swinhoei), from Formosa, is commonly
kept in confinement. The cock is blue with white crest, upper back,
and median rectrices ; the points of the wings are purplish red, and
the coverts edged with green. The hen is red brown mottled with
black. This is a hardy and prolific species. The cock assumes adult
plumage in his second year. One of us (Ghigi) has obtained a mutation
in which the cock has no red nor white rectrices, and the hen is light
yellow and black. This is H. dissimilis.
The Imperial Pheasant ( H. imperialis) , from the province of
Doughoi (Annam), is the rarest of Pheasants. I only met with one
pair, which I was fortunate enough to bring back alive and to breed it
in France. The cock is dark blue all over ; the hen is brown with
greyish cheeks, and lighter above than beneath. The species is hardy
and strong.
Edward's Pheasant (H. edwardsi ), from Central Annam, is
smaller than either of the two preceding. Incubation lasts twenty-one
days instead of twenty-four to twenty-five as in the above, and the
young cocks come into colour at four months, whereas the others do
not until eighteen months.
The cock is blue, with green-edged wings, and white crest. The
hen is entirely dark brown. This fine Pheasant is rare : it is hardy
in France but the young are rather delicate.
The Firebacks
The Siamese Fireback ( DiardigaUus diardi ) is common in Indo-
China, except in the North and the East of Siam. The cock is a splendid
bird ; its head is black with a large crest of hairy feathers with spatulate
tips ; mostly grey plumage irregularly streaked with black and white
on the wings ; abdomen, black-green ; centre of back yellow, lower

reflections ; wattles and legs, red.
The hen has no crest; she is chestnut red, her wings barred with
light tawny and black ; back, mottled tawny white, sides edged with
the same ; chestnut tail, except the median rectrices which are like
the wings.
This handsome Pheasant is hardy and breeds freely. Incubation
lasts 23 days ; the young are strong. Although their first plumage
is scarcely duller than the adult, they do not breed until they are
in their second year, and often the hens do not lay until their
third year.
It is best to rear the chicks by themselves, because they are not as
powerful as those of other species.

Pheasants of the genus Acomus are remarkable in several ways :
both sexes are crestless and have short compressed tails like the
domestic hen. They are medium size and thickset. Both sexes are
armed with spurs. Their wattles are red and their legs greenish-grey.
They frequent the great forests of Malaya, Sumatra, and Borneo.
In confinement they prove strong, and after the first year do not
need more than slight protection. They lay well, but the young
are delicate, needing great care and good shelter.
They are monogamous. Incubation lasts about 24 days.
The Kufous-tailed Pheasant (A. erythrophthalmus) lives in the
forests of the low-lying parts of Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. The
cock is blue-black, lightly streaked with white above and vermiculated
beneath with the same. His back is yellow passing to bronzy red,
his tail chamois yellow, with the sub-caudals black. The hen is
uniformly blue-black. This is a freely imported species. It has often
laid in confinement but the chicks have rarely come to maturity.
The Bornean Crestless Fireback (A. pyronotus), from Borneo,
only differs from the above in that the cock's plumage is more heavily
streaked with white. The hen is identical with the preceding. It is
not so freely imported and has not yet been bred in confinement.

The Sumatran Crestless Fireback (A. inornatus), inhabiting
the mountains of Sumatra, is very rare and has never come over alive.
The cock is wholly black and resembles the hens of the preceding
species except for the metallic blue edging to the feathers on the upper
parts of the body, while the hen is russet, vermiculated with black
and has a black tail.
The Crested Firebacks
This genus Lophura contains large and very handsome species,
which like the foregoing inhabit the low-lying forests of Malaya,
Sumatra, Borneo, and some neighbouring islands. Both sexes have
short, thick, spread-out crests, short, wide, and arched tails ; beautiful
cobalt blue wattles, and their prevailing colour is deep blue with
a large brilliantly red patch on the lower back. They are fairly often
imported and practically hardy, but it is wise to give them shelter
through the winter. They are strong and lay well but late in the season.
In cold places the young are delicate, need care, and a warm shelter.
The great difficulty in rearing these Pheasants is that the eggs are not
laid before June or July ; this does not allow sufficient time to rear
these large birds before winter sets in.
Vieillot's Pheasant (L. rufa), from the Malayan Peninsula,
is dark blue with white striped flanks, copper-red back, and the four
median rectrices white ; the wattles are divided into four equal lobes ;
the hen is chestnut, underneath spotted with white, tail chestnut brown.
It is occasionally imported and breeds fairly freely.
The Sumatran Pheasant (L. s. sumatrana) resembles the foregoing
save that its flanks have large chestnut red spots and its legs are grey
scarcely tinged with pink.
The White-tailed Pheasant ( L . s. alhipennis), from the north
of Sumatra, differs from the above in having red spots instead of white
on its flanks.
Delacour's Pheasant ( L . s. delacouri), from south of the island,
has, like the foregoing species, the lower chest and sides tawny red.
All these forms are imported from time to time.
The Bornean Fireback (L. ignita), from Borneo, has the whole
abdomen chestnut red as well as the four central rectrices. The hen

is redder than Vieillot's and is further distinguished by her grey legs
and blackish brown tail. This species is also slenderer. It is often
imported and thrives in Europe, where it has often been reared, but
special care must be taken of the chicks. A local form having the middle
of the abdomen black lives on the island of Banka, and has occasionally
been imported.
The Lobed Pheasant, Bulwer's magnificent Pheasant ( Lobiophasis
hulweri). from the Bornean mountains, constitutes a genus by itself.
Its crestless head is adorned with blue wattles prolonged into two long
points, and the higher ones truncated. Its plumage is dark blue
dappled with metallic blue like watered silk ; its tail, made up of more
than thirty long, wide, and strongly arched feathers, is snowy white.
Its legs are red. The hen is ruddy brown vermiculated with black,
and her straight tail is black. This splendid species is very rarely
imported. Mr. Spedan Lewis possesses a pair in England which do not
appear to be particularly delicate.
A FEW NOTES ON PHEASANTS
By Ethel F. Chawner
This has been a disappointing breeding season here. We have had
an unusually large proportion of infertile eggs, oddly enough chiefly
from pairs which did best last year. Tragopans and Black-backed
Kaleege (melanotus) have not laid any fertile eggs. Crossoptilons
laid freely, but only two eggs were fertile and both chicks were
deformed.
The rarer Pheasants, though in good condition, did not lay at all,
owing to drainage and water works having to be carried out close to
their pens just when the birds were displaying and preparing to breed.
Perhaps a short description of the display of two of the least
known species, Rheinart's Argus (Rheinardia ocellatus) and Bulwer's
Pheasant ( Lobiophasis hulweri ) may be worth recording.
The cock Rheinart begins his display by erecting his crest till

it looks as though his head were covered with thistle down, he draws
out his body to its full length, standing with his head held low and his
neck feathers ruffled and puffed out so that he looks the same thickness
all over. His long tail is spread horizontally so as to give every feather
its full value, and they overlap slightly like tiles on a roof. He will
stand as if he were cataleptic for as long as twenty minutes without
moving, almost without breathing, then make a sudden rush towards
the hen at the same time rapidly opening his wings, leap into the air,
and pick up a pebble or two in his beak and stand motionless once
more. The hen meanwhile wanders about attending to her own
affairs and does not so much as raise her head to observe the antics
of her lord.
I have not actually seen them pair, but the aviary attendant has
no doubt that they have done so. It was about this time last year
that a couple of eggs were laid, but I do not think it likely to happen
now ; the birds seem to have settled down and take no interest in
each other.
The cock Bulwer's display is even more spectacular. He signifies
his intention by strutting round his hen, his blue wattles blown out
and swinging with his movements like earrings. Next he expands his
wonderful tail until it looks like a snowy fan, and continues to strut,
gradually increasing his pace. Finally the tail is arched over his back
till only his head and neck are visible and he stands facing the hen
in this attitude for perhaps a couple of minutes. Unfortunately he
is very shy and will not show off if he thinks he is being watched ;
moreover he usually prefers the evening just before dusk so that it
would be very difficult to photograph him.
The hen in this case does seem interested : she usually walks
with him and keeps close to him when he displays. Again I am afraid
that nothing will come of it, though a couple of months ago the hen
frequently perched on the side of a box, which is fixed high up in the
aviary, and sometimes entered it. I expect such shy birds require a
really secluded well-planted aviary where they see no one except the
keeper, to induce them to breed.
A couple of months ago I sent a note to the Magazine describing
the strange behaviour of a pair of Crossoptilons (Hokis). Soon after

Ethel F. Chawner--A Few Notes 071 Pheasants
I sold them to a gentleman who is experienced in breeding Pheasants
and was interested in the account given of this pair. He turned them
into a really large enclosure with growing trees and plenty of cover.
They did not fight, and the hen laid several eggs, which, however,
were all infertile. They kept apart and took no interest in each other.
After they had been there some weeks a white Peacock in the same
aviary took a dislike to them and so harried them that their owner
removed them to a small aviary. Shortly after, loud shrieks were
heard, and the hen was found to be attacking and driving the cock
just as described in my note ; he again fled before her in the utmost
terror, and there is little doubt that she would have killed him had his
owner not come to the rescue and removed him. Does she know in
some mysterious way that he is sterile and resents his presence
accordingly ? He is, as I said before, a fine, well-developed bird wlm
does not look undeveloped or abnormal.
Another curious happening in the Pheasant world took place this,
spring in the aviaries on Whale Island. A pair of Amhersts have bred
normally for several years, but this centenary year the cock turned the
hen off the nest and would not allow her to sit and, in spite of her efforts,
took her place on the eggs. He sat for twenty-two days and hatched
four chicks, which were taken from him and put under a hen. He still
sat on the remaining egg which he hatched two days later, and the chick
was left with him. I saw him with his chick following him under the
shelter of his tail and watched him call it when he found a morsel of
food. The poor hen is not allowed any share in the upbringing of her
child.
The Commander sent an account of this abnormality to The Field,,
which appeared on 5th July. I understand that the Editor wrote that
cock Pheasants have been known to hatch and rear chicks, but that it.
has not previously been reported of an Amherst.

By A. A. Prestwich
A recent event of considerable interest to aviculturists was the opening
of the new Parrot House at the London Zoological Gardens. For many
years protests against the obvious inadequacy of the old house met with
no visible results, but at last, mainly through the instrumentality of
our Editor, a house worthy of the Society's fine collection of Psittacine
birds has been provided. We feel sure that those members who have
viewed the new house will agree that it is infinitely superior to the old
and as good as the circumstances permit. That there is atAeast one
person far from satisfied is obvious from a letter which appeared in
the Daily Mail of 26th June, in which the writer remarks :--
" This is simply the old restaurant quite inadequately adapted,
in which perhaps 2 or 3 per cent of the birds--the most intelligent
and sensitive of birds--is decently housed. It is draughty; it is for the
most part sunless. Big birds are cramped ; sociable birds are isolated ;
timid birds are, without possible retreat, at the mercy of teasing
passers-by.
"It is odious that affectionate creatures like Lories and Conures
should be caged singly. Any doubter should give a minute to playing
with the Brazilian " Golden " Conure--he welcomes even a human
friend in his solitary prison. It is odious that two big Cockatoos
should be caged together in a space where they can hardly stretch
their wings. Some Macaws seem not much to mind being chained
to a pole and being teased by all and sundry, but the two Green Macaws
in the collection live their days in perpetual alarm and unhappiness.
" This Parrot-house is a Parrot-prison, and a more enlightened
generation will look on us who tolerate such things rather as we look
on the gaol administrators of the inhuman eighteenth century."
Genuine criticism is often helpful, but in this case the views expressed
border on what might be called an hysterical outburst. To deal with
some of the points raised : One of the primary objects of the Gardens
is the exhibition of the largest possible number of representative species,
caged and housed in the best practical manner. The authorities are

A. A. Prestwick--The New Parrot House at the
the first to admit that many improvements in housing could be made
and that all is not ideal. It is obvious that the majority of the
Psittaciformes would do better in aviaries, but if suitable aviaries
were provided for all the birds in the Society's collection no space
would be available for anything else. And after all but a very small
percentage of the visitors take more than a passing interest in birds.
Owing to lack of space the number of aviaries is consequently limited,
and recourse has to be made to the next best things, namely, large and
roomy cages and flight-cages. A puerile objection is taken to the
house not being new ; certainly it is not new in its entirety, but it has
been altered and modified with considerable success, so much so that
unless informed one would not be aware that it had once been used
for a very different purpose to the present. After numerous visits
we have failed to notice any excessive draughts, but the complaint of
lack of light is more or less justified, not so much at the present time ;
but we can well imagine the house being dull during the winter. Special
efforts have been made to place pairs of birds in cages, and this has
been done in every possible case ; the exceptions being either through
lack of suitable companions or " incompatibility of temperament ".
The cages containing pairs of Cockatoos are quite large enough for
the purpose. The two Green Macaws--presumably Military--have
been in the Gardens since 1911, and, although somewhat timid compared
to some of their congeners, show no signs of unhappiness. Concerning
teasing, unfortunately every Zoological Garden has a small number
of irresponsible visitors--visitors who specialize in blowing tobacco
smoke at the exhibits ; visitors who poke with sticks and umbrellas ;
visitors who kind-heartedly insist on offering the most unsuitable
foods to all and sundry ; and visitors who, more kind-heartedly still,
give dangerous playthings, such as pieces of glass and razor blades.
But when the large number of visitors is taken into account, the
admittance of a few imbeciles is unavoidable.
The new house has been open only a short time, but a great improve-
ment in the general condition of the birds is already apparent, due
primarily to the improved conditions, increased roominess of most
of their quarters, an equitable temperature, and lack of draughts.
The building consists of two halls, that on the left of the entrance

containing the Ring-necks, Broad-tails, Lovebirds, Budgerigars,
Conures, Brotogerys, some Lories, and the Macaws (except during
the fine weather) : and the one to the right numerous large flight cages,
Cockatoos, true Parrots, Amazons, Lories, Pceocephalus, and a few
Macaws. A good range of outside flights is attached, and there is
every prospect of breeding successes being recorded. The importance
of the collection warrants a list of the species on view, but would prove
wearisome to the vast majority of readers, so only a few of the more
important exhibits and the inmates of the flight cages and aviaries
will be mentioned. It will suffice to state that there are some 130
species, in addition to hybrids, and almost without exception
they look well and contented. There is no official " oldest inhabitant ",
judged by length of time in the Gardens, but several have been there
since 1907, including a Blue and Yellow Macaw, Ducorp's Cockatoo,
and a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. An outstanding example of longevity
is the Aubrv's Parrot (Pceocephalus aubryanus ), which has been there
since 1909. This section is, as hitherto, in charge of Mr. W. Alden.

FEATHER-PLUCKING IN PARROTS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9507650625" page_id="56211719"  page_num="218" year="" vol="">
This has always been a most troublesome habit, and many theories
have been advanced as to its cause and numerous remedies suggested.
The most generally accepted theories as to the cause have been
(1) lack of occupation, and (2) feeding upon animal food or food of an
oily nature.
The remedies suggested have been varied, but the one generally
recommended has been to supply the patient with pieces of soft wood,
cotton reels, and so forth, in order to occupy its attention and divert
it from its feathers, to feed it upon plain seed and fruit, and to withhold
fats of all description.
Lord Tavistock, in Parrots and Parrot-like Birds , considers the
habit to be " the result of incorrect feeding, lack of bathing facilities,
boredom, or a combination of all three He considers that "it is
most likely to occur in birds that are kept alone, closely confined in
cages, fed on too much hemp and sunflower, given no fruit or green food,
and no branches or wood to chew. The giving of milk, meat and butter,

<bodyText confidence="0.999591916666667" page_id="56211720"  page_num="219" year="" vol="">
and the withholding of all bathing facilities are also likely to encourage
a Parrot to denude itself of its plumage ". As to treatment, his Lordship
recommends that the bird " should be placed on a diet of plain Canary
seed, with unlimited fruit and green food and no other tit-bits of any
kind He adds, " Feather-plucking in Parrots is never due, as has
often been stated, to lack of animal or insect food."
One has often come across particularly healthy and good-plumaged
Parrots which have been fed upon a diet which is completely wrong
according to the generally accepted theories. Their owners will tell one
that they share the food of the family, being given meat, vegetables,
bread and butter, suet pudding, or, in fact, whatever they take a fancy
to. And some of these Parrots, greys especially, have lived long years
in the family without any sign of ailment and always retained their
feathers.
I once owned a particularly tame Meyer's Parrot which was daily
allowed out of its cage, and if there were a meal going it would rush
for the butter dish and help itself (if allowed), or try and steal a mouth-
ful of fat from the joint or one's plate. And every Parrot I have had
has not hesitated to obtain fats if it had a chance of doing so.
I was therefore interested to read a letter by a lady, some time ago,
in Cage Birds to the effect that she had cured several grey Parrots of
feather-plucking by feeding them on a diet consisting for the most
part of fattening foods; hemp and sunflower seed, bacon fat, and bread
and butter. Her theory was that the cause of the trouble was the want
of fats in the food.
A lady wrote to me about her feather-plucking Parrot. She had
been advised to withhold all fattening foods and to feed upon plain
Canary seed and fruit. But she said the result was that the bird
continued its bad habit worse than ever, and she asked whether I
thought the cause of the trouble might not be that the bird really
needed fattening foods. I suggested that she should try the experiment
of feeding on a liberal supply of fats, and the result is recorded in the
following letter dated 28th June, 1930 :--
" Thank you for your letter of 11th March last in answer to mine
re the feather-plucking of my Parrot. I am very glad to be able to tell
you that the little fellow has now grown nearly all his feathers again,

Feather-plucking in Parrots
and I can only put it down to the oily diet which you advised me to
try when I wrote and asked you if it were possible that it was oil
he needed in his system. I have given him plenty of hemp and sun-
flower seed, bread w T ith lots of butter on it, bacon fat and a small
teaspoonful of olive oil every day mixed up with his usual moistened
rolled oats.
" It just goes to show the fallacy of the Parrot Experts (?) who
advise one to keep Parrots off all greasy things !
" I started him off on the above diet the day I got your letter, and
the soft grey down began to grow on his chest almost immediately.
He plucked it out a bit at first, but gradually seemed to leave it alone,
and now he actually is covered, or practically covered, with beautiful
green plumage almost as thick as it was before. I was afraid to write
and tell you before now, as I thought it almost too good to be true,
and felt I might wake up one morning and find he'd plucked it all out
again ! However, no such thing has happened yet, and as he looks
beautifully green and smooth I think surely it is quite safe to write and
tell you of the wonderful cure--always ' touching wood ' hard all the
time, though !
" You will be interested to know all this for your own information,
and I hope it will be of some use to you. With many thanks."
Another case is that of a Grey Parrot belonging to Mr. Martin
Duncan, Librarian to the Zoological Society. It was a bad feather-
plucker, and had completely denuded itself with the exception of its
head, wings and tail. Oil deficiency was suspected, and the above
treatment recommended with the result that the bird is now completely
clothed in a new suit of feathers.

YOUNG PHEASANTS AND OSTRICHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99675896875" page_id="56211722"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I am staying a few days with one of our American subscribers,
viz. Mr. C. F. Denley, of Rockville Md., who runs a pheasant farm as
a hobby. This place is situated about 8 miles from the U.S. Capitol
of Washington, D.C. Mr. Denley has been a keen aviculturist since he
was a school-boy, but he now specializes in Fancy Pheasants, and he has
a very large collection. He has had a very successful rearing season so
far this year, and amongst the youngsters that are ready for separating
from the hens are Elliots, Manchurians, Impeyans, Firebacks, Nepal
Kaleege, Amherst, Reeves, Goldens, Silvers, Swinhoes, and Tragopans.
The successful rearing of the latter seems to be an exceptional event
either in England or U.S.A.
Mr. Denley has previously experienced difficulty with Impeyans, *
but this season he has reared ten out of eleven, one accidentally being
killed.
The birds that struck me most, however, were a cock and two hens,
Specifer Peafowl. I have seen this species before, but till I saw these
I never realized how much more beautiful it is than the common
Peafowl. Mr. Denley informs me that one Specifer hen laid seven eggs
before reaching twelve months of age. This appears to me a year earlier
than is usual with Peafowl. He has also about fifty White Peafowl.
He rears a large number annually, but for some mysterious reason they
have not laid well this season. However, the important part of this
letter is to record the fact that Mr. Denley has three fine young
Ostriches. Just out of curiosity, he got some eggs from an Ostrich farm
in Florida and put them in an incubator. Three of the eggs proved
fertile and hatched after forty-two days. The three young ones are
in a large grass pen and are quite fearless of human beings or dogs, and
can be handled with ease.
I had to confess my ignorance of how to feed young Ostriches
when my host asked me, but they seem to thrive well on chopped
cabbage leaves, egg and bread, and have enormous appetites.
Mr. Denley has built some aviaries, which can be heated in winter,

THE SARUS CRANE IN INDIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998485291666667" page_id="56211723"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
Sir, --You published two letters about Sarus Cranes recently.
Here in Rajputana these are common. Every lake or " Tank " has
at least one pair. Once out shooting I found eggs on a muddy bit of
mud bank close to the water. I think they were Sarus eggs because
the pair worried me until I moved on. Again, one hot afternoon late
in the winter I saw a pair of Sarus Cranes running away and noticed
one of them go into the water and apparently call for young ones.
I followed up and found nothing. Then watching the parent birds
running and half flying away I noticed a young one with them. I had
promised to try to get a few young ones. A lady wanted them for her
garden as " Chowkidars " (Watchmen). So I wanted to catch the young
one, but as I got up to him I lost him. Feeling rather a fool, I sat down
and consoled myself for a bad day's shooting by having a long deferred
meal. Whilst I was munching a sandwich I saw a young Sarus Crane
come out of the water just close to where I was. He was so obviously
sure that he was safe, and looked so nice I felt I could not frighten him.
So I quietly hid as best I could, and was rewarded by seeing Mother and
Father Sarus collect him and also another from the spot where one
of them had first gone into the water. Apparently they had been
made to hide under water, or almost under it.
In our Zoo here we have " Tamas ", an old Sarus Crane. A village
petitioned to have him removed as he pecked the children. Our P. W.
Dept, lorry was duly sent out 33 miles to fetch him in. Going out to
shoot I met Tamas coming along in the lorry (one leg tied to the other),

lifting his head up and crying out defiance to the world. Tamas had
a soft time in the Superintending Engineer's garden. But the servants
said he might peck out the Missey Baba Sahib's eyes. So off he went
to the Zoo. There he has a wonderful old keeper who has taught
him to dance to order, and finish off his performance with a brazen call.
I gave Tamas what I hope is a wife ; but he won't look at her. She
won't learn to dance and always goes away and sulks when Tamas
makes an exhibition of himself dancing. There are several pairs in the
deer park, but they never breed.

P.S.--The local people here say that the Sarus mates for life, and
they say they are held half sacred because they represent the bond of
love and faithfulness.

BRONZE-WINGED MANNIKINS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.97209775" page_id="56211724"  page_num="223" year="" vol="">
Sir, --You will no doubt be interested to know that the Bronze-
winged Mannikins hatched on 31st May, the day we visited Mr. and
Mrs. Ezra's, are now flying out in the open aviary. They left the nest,
on Sunday, 22nd July. What struck me as peculiar was that instead
of going back to their own nest-box the parents went to another box
out in the open and took the little ones with them, and have done so
each evening. The youngsters measure 1J in. to 1J in. long, and the
plumage is brown and very smooth ; their flight is almost as swift
as that of their parents.
One of them takes wing exercise soon after six o'clock each morning.
They have been reared entirely on seed and seeding grass. Soft food
was not touched, but a little soaked seed was taken for the first three
or four days after hatching.
I thought the above may be of interest as I am not aware as to how
often these little ones are successfully reared.

A PROLIFIC HEN COCKATIEL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98417376" page_id="56211725"  page_num="224" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The hen of one of my pairs of Cockatiels (now in her fourth
year) went to nest fairly early this spring, laying five eggs, all of which j
-contained chicks. Unfortunately, however, probably owing to being
disturbed at night or through remaining off too long during some
rather cold weather, only one egg hatched--each of the other eggs
having a dead chick in it.
Before this single youngster was anywhere near fledged or ready
to leave the nest she started nesting operations again, this time laying
a clutch of nine, which I think must be nearly a record and which
she must have found some difficulty in covering properly. Seven of
these duly hatched and all are now thriving fledglings. The other
two eggs had half-formed chicks in them.
I have kept and bred Cockatiels for a number of years, but I have
never known so large a single clutch as nine or a hatch of seven.
Previously I have had several lots of six fully reared.
Hamilton Scott.
A NOTE FROM SOUTH AFRICA
Sir,--I receive the Magazine regularly, and must say it is wonderful.
I am mainly interested in the Parrakeets, and have just succeeded
in breeding the beautiful Hooded Parrakeet (Psephotus dissimilis),
three young birds being reared.
I also keep a fair number of our indigenous birds, Waxbills, Finches,
etc., and have managed to breed most of them.
On one occasion no less than eight young Black-cheeked Waxbills
were reared from one nest in my aviary.

Jungle Fowl

These wild fowls are a highly specialized genus (Gallus) whose
principal characteristic is the fleshy comb ornamenting their heads.
They have bare faces and one or two small wattles hanging under their
beaks. Their tails are graduated and laterally compressed, the upper
coverts and the two central rectrices being curved sickle wise.
The plumage of the hens is very different, and they have only a
rudimentary comb.
There are four distinct species of Jungle Fowl found in Ceylon,
India, Burma, Indo-China, Malaya, Sumatra, Java, and the near
islands. They have also been naturalized in the Philippines and several
of the neighbouring islands. They live in wood and thickets and often
come out to find their food in clearings and rice fields. They can often
be seen on the roadside, and they do not fear the neighbourhood of
houses. They feed on seeds, berries, and insects. Their flight is
powerful and they are usually very shy.

The wild cocks rival the Pheasants in looks. They have nothing of
the heaviness of domestic poultry. The Red or Bankiva Jungle Fowl
is hardy in the temperate parts of Europe ; the other species require
shelter in winter, but only the newly imported need heat.
The chicks are rather delicate and must be kept from damp and
cold until they are full grown.
The cocks are polygamous, and can be mated to two or three hens.
The eggs are pinkish white and the clutches follow one another all
through spring and summer. A clutch usually contains four to eight
eggs. Incubation lasts eighteen to twenty-one days. The chicks
need as much care as the most delicate Pheasants.
The Red or Bankiva Jungle Fowl (Gallus galius) is the father
of all our domestic poultry. In appearance, size, and colour he looks
like a golden Bantam, but his shape is more delicate, his comb smaller,
and his tail more horizontal. The hen has neither comb nor wattles.
The crow is like that of the domestic cock only shorter and shriller.
It is a native of Himalaya and East India, Burma, South China, Indo-
China, Siam, Malaya, Sumatra, and Java. Elsewhere they have
been imported and naturalized.
Five races are recognized : G. g. murghi from India, wdiich has
small white wattles and very pointed hackles.
G. g. jabouillei from Tonkin, with a small comb, little red wattles,
and redder plumage.
G. g. gallus from Cochin China, Annam, and Cambodia, has very
large white wattles.
G. g. robinsoni from Malaya, Burma, and Siam, like the preceding
but has red wattles.
G. g. bankiva from Java, is darker and the hackles are very round.
Bankiva is hardy and a free breeder. It is much stronger than the
other species and does well at liberty in a park. It is excellent game,
with very succulent flesh, and its naturalization is very desirable.
Pure wild specimens are recognized by their small combs, horizontal
tails, brief crow, and above all by the fact that when they moult they
lose all the ornamental hackles round the neck and on the sides, and
grow them again several months later ; thus they may be said to go
into eclipse plumage.

The Ceylon Jungle Fowl (G. lafayetti) is confined to Ceylon.
The cock is very handsome. His neck is striped yellow and black ;
breast, back, and shoulders, coppery red striped with black ; the rest
of the wings, the tail and abdomen, black ; his serrated comb is red
and yellow ; he has two wattles and red legs. The hen is russet brown,
her neck feathers striped with black and edged with yellow ; those of
the back and wings have white tips; the under parts are white speckled
with black and tawny.
The eggs may be white or tawny, one colour, or blotched. The
crow of the cock is peculiar. This species is very rarely imported,
although common in its own country. It has lately been bred at the
Zoological Gardens of London, and does not appear to be delicate.
Sonnerat's Jungle Fowl (G. sonnerati) comes from the South
and West of India. It is a fine bird with serrated comb and red wattles.
The cock is pencilled with grey, white, and black. The wing coverts
are orange-red, but, which is unique in this class of bird, the barbs
of the feathers are united with the shaft and appear as though
ornamented with a spot of sealing-wax. There is the same peculiarity
in the neck hackles, which are straw-coloured with black spots. The
neck hackles are moulted in summer and replaced by short dark grey
feathers, pencilled like the rest of the body, with a little orange-red
at the tips. The flight feathers and the tail with their coverts are
purple-black ; the legs are yellow with a shade of red.
The hen is brown above with black and yellow stripes on the neck ;
her breast feathers are white, washed with black, passing to brown on
the abdomen. This handsome bird is often imported and proves hardy;
but it is well to give it shelter during winter, though artificial heat
is not necessary unless the weather is excessively cold. The young
are rather delicate and slow growing. The cock has a loud and
peculiar crow.
Sonnerat is very sluggish. If set at liberty in a park it does not
wander, but the cocks are apt to keep company with domestic hens,
with which they pair freely, producing fertile hybrids. But for all that
Sonnerat is spiteful, and when he has taken possession of a place he
will fight with the neighbouring poultry.
The Green or Javan Jungle Fowl (G. varius) is perhaps the

handsomest. It is found on that island and those to the East.
The cock has a simple unserrated comb, blue and green, edged with
red, and one wattle of the same colour, with a yellow spot on the
throat. The under parts are black with green reflections ; the hackles
of the lower back black-green edged with yellow ; the mantle of short
rounded dark green feathers tipped with coppery-red ; the tail is
metallic green, legs whitish.
The hen has her upper parts black edged tawny and pale shafts
to the feathers ; her under parts are tawny with brown markings, and
her throat is white. The cock is freely imported, but the hen is very
rare in Europe. This is the most delicate of the Jungle Fowl, and it
is wise during winter to keep them in slight heat. It has lately been
bred in Italy.
A fine pair were imported in January, 1925, and kept in a heated
place through the winter ; when spring came the birds were moved
to a Pheasant aviary and remained there all through the next winter,
but the shelter of their aviary had the windows kept closed. In April,
1926, the hen laid three eggs, from which two cocks were reared. She
laid several small clutches during the summer and autumn. In 1927
she began to lay early in March and laid forty eggs altogether, but
the young were not reared. In 1928 two cocks and four pullets were
reared. These laid when a year old. The cock's comb and wattles
take a whole year to develop.
At Cleres and Boulogne we reared half and three-quarter hybrids
with a hen Bankiva, and similar hybrids were reared in the London
Zoo some years ago.
Hybrid cocks are fertile, but fertilized eggs are few. It is curious
that these cocks had three wattles, the middle one being the largest.
The Javan cock has a very peculiar crow.
The Eared Phesants
The Crossoptilons or Eared Pheasants (Crossoptilon) are not
closely allied to any other genus of the Pheasant family. They are
known by their long, curved, strong beaks, specialized for digging in
the ground ; their legs are long and red, and the cock wears short
spurs. Their heads are covered with short black curled feathers, looking

like velvet, and the feathers over the ears are white and prolonged
upward and back in two long aigrettes shaped like hooks. Their tails
contain twenty to twenty-four long and wide feathers, decomposed
and highly ornamental; the rest of the plumage is long, thick, and
furry. They have red wattles. The hen has no spurs ; young birds
take adult plumage after the first moult, but do not breed until they
are two years old.
Crossoptilons are large birds ; they are monogamous and sociable.
They can be met in flocks in the mountainous and rocky parts of China,
as well as among the fir and birch forests of Tibet and the neighbouring
Chinese and Himalayan borders. They live in very cold spots. They
do well in confinement and become very tame.
One species is fully acclimatized in Europe and breeds there freely.
On account of their tameness and habit of digging they are better
kept in large open pens or even in a park. They usually lay eight to
twelve eggs at least. Incubation lasts twenty-seven days. The chicks
are very easily reared if given plenty of room when they are five to
six weeks old. They grow more quickly than any other gallinaceous
birds, and in consequence must have extra large rations.
The Manchurian Crossoptilon or Hoki (C . mantchuricum) a
native of North China, has brown plumage and the lower back and
tail white, the rectrices edged and finished purplish-black. This
handsome species is common in confinement, and is one of the nicest
naturalized Pheasants.
The Blue Crossoptilon (C . auritum) from North Tibet and North-
West China is blue-grey, with the rectrices finished blue-black, the
three last being white at the base. This fine species has very rarely
been imported, and for a long time has not figured in European
collections. Now a splendid lot of twenty has arrived at Cleres in
perfect health.
The two above-mentioned species have twenty-four rectrices in
their tails, the plumes of which are long, slack, and separated. The
three following have twenty rectrices with close plumes of more normal
appearance ; their aigrettes are shorter.
The White Crossoptilon (C. Tibetanum) from Tibet Sechuan,
and Yunnan, is pure white with a black head and tail with fine green

and purple reflections. It is very seldom imported and has not bred.
It would be a splendid addition to our Pheasantries.
Drouyn's Crossoptilon (C. c. drouyni) has grey wings and tail
whitish-grey at the base.
Harman's Crossoptilon (C . harmani) from North Assam and
South-East Tibet is slatey-grey, very dark on the neck, and has a white
chin, nape and throat, also the middle of the abdomen ; its tail is
bronzed-blue-black. This handsome species has not yet been imported.

Monaul Pheasants
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997606538461538" page_id="56211745"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
The Pheasants of this group are reckoned among the most
brilliantly coloured birds in the world, their plumage having extra-
ordinary metallic lustre.
They are strongly built, thick-set birds, with medium, almost
square tails, short stout legs, powerful and curved beaks. The sexes
are very dissimilar. They are the Pheasants found in the mountain
forests of Himalaya, Tibet, Yunnan, and North-West China. Their
call is a shrill loud whistle.
The Monauls, at least the species acclimatized in Europe, are
hardy and robust. They need fairly large pens, are strong diggers,
and live well in parks ; but the combativeness of the males is too great
for several to be kept in the same enclosure. They lay four to five
eggs to a clutch, and incubation lasts twenty-seven days. The young
are easy to rear if they can be given liberty. In enclosures they are
subject in many places to a disease which affects their eyes and nostrils
and kills them at the age of two months ; they never contract it at
liberty. They are very subject to red worm.
The Impeyan or Monaul Pheasant (L . impeyanus) inhabits the
Himalayas from Afghanistan to Bhutan. The cock wears a green
aigrette ; all his under parts from throat to tail are deep black ; his
tail is bright chestnut, and the middle of his back is white ; all the rest
of his plumage is most brilliantly metallic ; head blue-green, neck
coppery-red, upper back yellow, wings and lower back purple dappled
with blue. The skin round the eyes is bare and blue ; beak and legs
brownish-horn.
The hen is rather light chestnut-brown, spotted with brown-black,

with throat and chin white. She has a short crest. The young cock
attains adult plumage at eighteen months, but can be recognized from
the first autumn by black feathers under the chin ; they breed when
tw&amp;apos;o years old.
Lhuys Monaul ( Llhuysi ) from China (Sechuan and Kokonoor)
is larger than the preceding ; the cock has a large blue and purple
crest directed backwards. His colouring is nearly the same as that of
impeyanus, but lacks the white on the back, and his tail is blue with
white spots at the base, and very long coverts of the same shade.
The hen is greyer and has a white spot on the back.
This magnificent and rare species has very seldom been imported,
and has not been bred in confinement.
Sclater's Monaul (L. sclateri) inhabits the mountains north of
Burmah and Yunnan, is smaller and crestless, and his head is covered
with curly green feathers. He is known by his coppery-red shoulders
and neck, by his back, rump and sub-caudals being white with black
lines, and red tail with white tip. The hen has no crest ; her rump
is pale grey streaked w&amp;apos;ith black and her tail is black with white bars
and tip.
This beautiful species has very rarely been imported.

Koklas Pheasants

<bodyText confidence="0.998530846153846" page_id="56211746"  page_num="231" year="" vol="">
The genus Pucrasia is very distinct and apart from all others.
These somewhat small Pheasants are known by their fully feathered
heads, ornamented with a large backwards directed crest, heightened
by large tufts at the sides ; in both sexes the tail is rather short but
widely separated and pointed with very long sub-caudals. Most of
the feathers are lanceolate. The wings are long and sharply pointed
for a Pheasant. The general effect of the plumage is different shades
of brown, finely variegated with grey, black, white, andrus set. The
cock has spurs.
The hen is more like the cock than is usual among Pheasants ;
she is, however, smaller and paler.
The Koklas are found in Himalaya, Afghanistan up to Nepal,
and from Oriental Tibet to Mongolia and a great part of China. They

Professor A. Ghigi and J. Delacour--Pheasants
are found on high mountains in woods about 2,000 to 4,000 metres.
They are seldom imported, and it is a long time since there were any
in European pheasantries. This is a great pity, for they are very pretty
and formerly did well, being very hardy and easily reared without
more care than is Usually bestowed on Pheasants. The hens lay freely.
They are monogamous. All that is needful is to keep them in airy,
sunny aviaries and free from damp.
The Koklas ( Pucrasia macrolopha) lives in Kashmir and the
adjoining states. The cock has a yellow tawny crest with black sides
which have green reflections, like the rest of his head save for two
white spots on the sides of his neck. The upper parts are grey with
black streaks ; the middle of the breast bright chestnut, flanks grey
with black streaks, shaded russet; russet tail with all the feathers
except the median, black-tipped and white edged. The hen is coloured
like a hen Monaul.
This species has occasionally been imported and bred abundantly
with M. Comely, near Tours.
To east and west of the district sub-species may be found : P. m.
bidduljphi, P. m. castanea, P. m. nipalensis. The chief difference
lies in the extent and intensity of the black and chestnut. None of
them have yet been imported alive.
The Yellow-necked Koklas (P. xanthospila) of Tibet and North
China has the upper neck yellow, feathers which have two black lines
instead of one, and grey-blue lateral rectriees tipped black and white,
possessed by the hen as well as the cock. This species has been
imported, and was as successful as the preceding.
Three races are recognized besides the type : P. x. rujicollis, P. x.
joretiana, P. x. meyeri. The first has an orange back instead of yellow ;
the second has no yellow at all on the back ; and the third has a russet
tail instead of a grey one. They have not yet been imported.
Darwin's Koklas (P. darwini) inhabits the Chinese Maritime
provinces of Chekiang and Foukhien and has four black lines on his
back. His crest is shorter and he has no yellow on his neck. It has
been imported at long intervals and has even been bred in Europe.
A greyer sub-species (P. d. styani) is found further in the interior of
the country (Hupeb).

The Horned Pheasants or Tragopans
The Tragopans comprise five very distinct species of strongly built,
thick-set birds, reminding one of Partridges. The cocks have a short
crest, two fleshy erectile horns, and a curious fleshy bib very brightly
coloured, which they can develop at will when displaying; their
cheeks and throats are bare and adorned with bright colours. Their
beaks are short and strong ; legs fairly long ; the tail tapers slightly
and is compressed. The plumage in general is spotted. The hen has
a fully feathered head and her plumage is a pretty mixture of various
shades of brown variegated with black and tawny.
Tragopans live in the great mountain forests of Himalaya, Upper
Burmah, and China. They are monogamous ; their voice is a kind of
bark. They lay three to five eggs and incubate them tw&amp;apos;enty-eight
days.
These beautiful birds are hardy in confinement; they live and breed
freely, but the cocks in particular sometimes die suddenly ; they need
shelter against damp and good high perches, w T here they pass most
of their time ; they prefer to lay in a high nest. They do well in a
large enclosure or pen. The young require largely vegetarian food ;
they grow slowly but are not delicate.
The Crimson Tragopan (T. satyr a) comes from Central and West
Himalaya. His head is black and the bare portions are blue ; his
bib is blue in the centre, green with red spots on the outside. His
eyebrows, neck, and all the upper part of the body is fiery red, the last
dotted with white black-rimmed spots. The under parts are brown
with tiny white spots ; tail black. The hen is brown with black and
tawny spots, and long tawny spots on her breast. The young are full
grown at eighteen months.
This superb species is freely imported and fairly easy to rear.
The Western Tragopan [T. melanocejphalus) of the West
Himalayas has a black head, eyes surrounded with carmine, blue throat,
pink bib, with cobalt blue in the middle ; fiery red neck shading into
yellow in front on the breast; under parts black, with white dots and
red spots ; upper parts brown spotted and powdered with white ;
black rectrices, yellow sub-caudals black-edged. The hen is greyer
than the preceding.

Professor A. Ghigi and J . Delacour--Pheasants
This is a very rare species in confinement, but it was bred formerly.
Blyth's Tragopan (T. blythi) from North-east Assam is chestnut
with black and brown markings, powdered with white above, entirely
ruddy-grey beneath, with neck, upper breast, and sides red, the last-
named with black and white marking ; black head and red eyebrows ;
cheeks, round the eyes and throat golden yellow, edged with light
green ; yellow bib bordered with blue violet; light blue horns. The
hen is more olive than Satyra.
An allied form is darker above, with less red on the breast and
lighter underneath. This species, extremely rare in confinement,
has been bred in France, and was crossed with the following.
Temminck's Tragopan (T. temmincki) is found among mountains
from Tibet and Yunnan to Central China. It is perhaps the most
beautiful of them all; the cock has fine lacquer red eyebrows, neck
and under parts, these last spotted with light grey. The upper parts
are deep red thickly covered with white black-edged spots ; head
black, the bare parts bright blue, with triangular red marks on the
sides. The hen is small and russet brown. This noble bird used to
be common in our aviaries but has disappeared of recent years. It
is heartily to be wished that it may soon be re-imported. It is the
hardiest of all the Tragopans in confinement.
Cabot's Tragopan (T. caboti) from South-east China, has
a black head, eyebrows and sides of neck fiery red, orange face,
pale blue horns, orange bib, brownish-red in the middle, with a wide
cobalt blue border and livid grey spots ; the upper parts of the body
chestnut-red, with numerous large pale spots edged with black on the
sides ; beneath entirely russet sides, ruddy and black. The hen is
dark greyish-brown.
Cabot's Tragopan is fairly often imported, and has been bred in
Europe ; it is tame and breeds freely, but the cocks often die suddenly.

By Capt. G. W. Thompson
It would be interesting to me to know when green Glossy Starlings
were last bred, and how, and also if any have been bred this year.
They are very favourite birds of mine, and I always keep several.
A very tame hen I have has never shown serious signs of breeding
before this year. Towards the end of May a nest was built in a large
nest box, plenty of feathers being used. I did not interfere, and on
the 19th of June a piece of egg shell was found on the ground. Next
day another piece clearly showed an egg had hatched. The shell
was a pale blue-green, speckled thinly all over in the manner of a
blackbird's, but not so thickly. As events seemed to indicate, only
two eggs were laid, as two young hatched, and no other egg was found.
Following my custom of liberating Softbills when breeding, I lost
no time in opening a small portion of the wire netting close to the
nest, and it was not long before both birds were out and searching
for insects on the ground. They soon found some suitable morsel,
and were not slow in finding the way into the nest. As they knew me
well, they soon followed me about and got to know where I kept the
mealworms ! I was sparing with these, however, as I wished them to
forage for themselves. They very soon finished off a crop of cherries,
and began to go farther and farther afield, until they made the
acquaintance of cows in a field, when their joy was complete; for they
soon found that insects abounded in the grass around the cows, and so
spent most of their time with them, sometimes several fields away.
The cock once had to " jump to it " to avoid being stamped into the
ground by a cow's nose ! As the young grew they could be heard calling
like young Starlings, but in more musical voices. Food for them became
larger and more varied. Large moths, beetles, and many baby frogs,
and grasshoppers and cherries, all went the same way, but never any
kind of artificial food until the young were out of the nest. Then
anything, seemed to do--meat, egg, dried currants, etc.
The old birds were well able to take care of themselves, and the
cock strongly objected to wild Starlings, chasing them quite a long
way. On the 12th July a youngster was looking out of the nest box,
and I should have accepted this warning and closed the egress to the
parents. But I was loathe to do this, and consequently next morning

one was being fed in some high oak trees, and the other (and last) was
out too during the day. They sat in the trees for two days, while
the parents took them food. My problem was now how to get them
back. I closed the parents in their aviary, and when the youngsters
got really hungry they had to come to them and be fed from inside.
By means of nuts, arranged over the wire, I eventually caught them,
and all went well--but it was by no means easy, and a most
trying experience to the temper ! They slept under the open wire,
and I intended fixing some protection over this, but, of course, left
it too late, for the other morning one youngster lay dead inside with
neck mauled and leg pulled off through the wire. It may have been a
prowling cat, but I think more probably an Owl, as there are not many
cats near me, luckily. It is a great pity, but I am thankful the other
escaped.
The plumage of the young is of a rusty black, but distinctly glossed
on the upper parts with greenish-blue ; eyes almost black.
The parents were most attentive, and still feed the one left.
I have a fine pair of Purple-backed Glossy Starlings, Lamprotornis
purpureous, and these nested and laid three pale blue eggs in May.
As the hen did not sit well I transferred the eggs (two fertile) to a wild
Starling's nest, with eggs about the same age. All went well until
hatching time seemed to pass, and then, on investigating, I found the
nest empty, the eggs having been taken by probably a Magpie. A
most annoying experience, as I believe there is only one other pair
of these birds in this country. There seems no hope of the birds
breeding again.
Spreo superbus would have bred had not the cock died suddenly.
The hen built two nests, but her second mate proved to be a hen.
All these birds live in aviaries to themselves, each having a shelter
house and flight of about 12 ft. by 7 ft. or so.
In my larger aviaries for mixed birds I have a Royal Long-tailed,
Red-eyed Glossy Starlings, two Purple-headed (not sexed), one White-
capped, pair of Military Starlings, pair of Mandarins, Pagoda Mynahs
(which would not breed this year), two Redwings, and a hand-reared
hen Thrush, which has laid many eggs. Last, but not least, a very
tame hand-reared common Starling.
I trust these notes may prove of interest.

In the spring time there are perhaps few more beautiful places
in the world than a Sicilian garden. Everywhere are billowy masses
of pink almond blossom, the succulent grass is an almost unbelievable
green, the tall slender cypress-trees point to the clear blue heavens,
and everywhere is a riot of colour with a thousand and one brilliant
flowers. The wild marigolds, the rosemary, the wild lavender, and a
hundred other flowers which clothe the fertile hillsides scent the air
with a rich and pungent aromatic odour. Everything and everywhere
seems to breathe the spirit of peace and plenty. Usually the only
sounds are the music made by the birds and the swish of the gentle
tide of the blue Mediterranean.
The birds one sees are nearly all the smaller ones, and we miss
the rich and cheerful song of the Blackbirds and Thrushes, and though
one does at times see these birds in a wooded kloof or on the mountain
sides, they are shy and wary, and seldom thrust themselves upon
one's notice like the semi-domesticated birds of the English countryside.
They have good reason to keep themselves out of the way, for they
are eagerly sought after by the local gunners, who prowl about in search
of all feathered life, no matter how small. Fortunately, there are
many estates of foreigners in Sicily owned by both English and Germans,
where all small birds are protected, and thus the bird population is
not so depleted as one would expect by these wretches, who kill every-
thing from a Wren to an Eagle.
After the Sparrows, which are of the Italian species, and differ
both in colour and demeanour from their British cousins, in being a
lighter colour, and having a more distinctly marked back and white
eye-brow, and in being much wilder and usually keeping in small
flocks in the orchards, the lovely little Goldfinches are perhaps the
commonest birds. Everywhere one sees and hears them ; they frequent
all the almond orchards and may be seen in flocks feeding on the ground,
or pecking the tiny insects from off the almond blossom. The almond-
trees are a great attraction to the smaller birds whilst the flowers last;

small flocks of all kinds of birds may be seen searching the blossoms,
I should think for small insects which are attracted by the honey.
Even right up on the old lava streams on Etna one sees the
brilliant little Goldfinches, where their bright colouring makes a striking
contrast to the sombre surroundings.
A chorus of Goldfinches singing in the blossom-laden trees is a
sound to be remembered and a sight which remains in the memory
for many a day. In all the poverty-stricken little villages and towns
on the slopes of the great volcano one sees a great many of these little
birds caged by the peasants, usually in cages far too small for the
inmates. In some the birds cannot even open their wings.
One of the sweetest songsters to be found in the olive and almond
groves is the Mediterranean Warbler, a charming little bird reminding-
one of a Blackcap. It is about the same size as that bird, pale grey
in colour with a white throat and a jet black head. The black extends
below the eye and thus forms a mask, and in this way the bird can be
distinguished from any other Warbler. The fan-shaped tail is tipped
with white. It is a common inhabitant of the quiet groves and gardens.
It is rather intolerant of observation, though I have spent many a
pleasant hour in watching it in its ever-active search for the tiny
insects upon which it feeds. It is fond of haunting the bed of giant
Montbretia, where it may be seen making a search of the long tubular
flowers for insects. The song, which is usually uttered from a clump
of dense undergrowth, is half like that of a Robin and half like that
of a Nightingale. One little male used to practise his song every
morning, hidden in the dense ivy which covered an old Italian well
near my bedroom. The male and female usually go about together,
the hen being lighter in colour than her mate, and the black cap not
nearly so dark. It is the commonest Warbler in the island.
The Sub-Alpine Warbler appears about April and is then quite
common on the island. It has a very distinctive song which the male
utters from the top of a bush. These birds, like the last mentioned,
are only seen in pairs. These are strikingly-coloured little Warblers,
the male being a delicate shade of grey above, the throat and breast
a rich russet-red, and there is a white moustache-like line which divides
the grey from the red on each side of the head. The female is altogether
paler in colouring.

Another beautiful Warbler which is occasionally seen is the
Spectacled Warbler. It somewhat resembles the former bird, but the
colours are brighter and the breast is more of a pink shade. It is not
as common as the Sub-Alpine Warbler. Many other species of Warblers
are found, but owing to the thick vegetation of the hillsides they are
very difficult to identify.
The Robin is found in Sicily, but he appears much sleeker and
brighter in colour than his English cousin. The under-wing coverts
seem much lighter and appear almost white when the bird is in flight.
The Sicilian bird is very much wilder and hasn't the same familiarity
as our British bird.
The Nightingale is perhaps even commoner than the Robin at certain
seasons of the year, and is quite a bird of the gardens. I heard a rather
interesting thing from several of the peasants, that the Nightingale
was a permanent resident of Sicily, moving down from the higher
altitudes to the warmer valleys near the coast in the winter time.
This statement was disputed by a local ornithologist, who said that the
peasants mistook this bird for a Warbler, which very much resembled
the Nightingale.
In the gardens, around the old Greek ruins, on the seashore and
on most of the stoney places on the mountain sides, one catches sight
of a very beautiful Redstart of a species, alas, which I cannot discover.
It resembles the Black Redstart but has the top of the head pure white.
Though I have seen it nowhere else in Europe it appears to be a common
bird in Sicily. When it alights the beautiful rich chestnut tail shows
to advantage as it is rapidly jerked up and down in the same manner
as that of a Wagtail. The hen is much duller in colouring and lacks
the white on the wings and head ; she is mostly grey with a much
lighter chestnut tail than her mate.
These birds feed largely on flies which swarm on the drying seaweed
on the seashore.
I don't know quite what thrilled me the most the first day I arrived,
hearing in the moonlight in a vast ruined Greek theatre the strains
of old Sicilian airs played by peasants on the national instruments
or seeing for the first time the lovely Blue Rock Thrush.
This bird is in shape like a slimmer edition of the European Thrush

Sydney Porter--The Birds of a Sicilian Garden
but of a lovely dark powder blue, much lighter on the head. It only
inhabits the high and mountainous parts of Southern Europe, where,
as its name implies, it lives amongst the rocks. In demeanour it rather
resembles a Chat.
The Sicilians are fond of caging this bird on account of its fine
song, but, alas, their knowledge of aviculture is not what one would
wish it to be. The birds are confined to small and very inadequate
all-wire cages, seldom if ever cleaned out, and they are fed upon . . .
well, just what scraps are going. So the birds usually present a very
dejected appearance. One old gentleman whom I met had several
of these birds in perfect condition, and he fed them upon a mixture
of what seemed to be dried cockroaches and chopped egg.
Most of the smaller British birds are represented in Sicily by sub-
species, some which differ but slightly, and others which seem to be
quite different.
The Chaffinch is another very common bird and seems to be rather
duller in colour than th'e British type.
The Cole Tit is also very common, and is found in nearly all the
gardens, where it can be seen feeding upon the minute insects which
infect the almond blossom. It seems considerably different from the
British bird in being more distinctly marked and having a patch of
pure white on the nape. I believe that this is a distinct species and
is confined to the island.
A species of Tree-creeper, which I believe is the Southern Short-toed
Tree-creeper, is very common. This bird is particularly partial to the
olive- and fruit-trees, where it finds the small insects upon which it lives
underneath the loose bark of the trunks. These birds always look
more like mice than birds as they run with amazing rapidity up and
down and around the trunks.
The lovely little Serin Finch is very abundant and small flocks are
often to be seen. These birds are very gregarious and visit the gardens
in small bands to feed upon the minute seeds of the grasses and weeds,
and also upon the small insects which the almond blossom harbours.
On a bright sunny day, which is to say almost every day, every
tall almond-tree seems to harbour one of these birds who trills his
strange song nearly all the sunny hours. Some writers have called

this bird's song unpleasant, but to me it has always seemed singularly
sweet; but then perhaps I am no criterion, for nearly all bird sounds
except the nocturnal " songs " of the Corncrake and the Owls are music
to my ears ! The song is very continuous but perhaps a trifle automatic.
The little singer puts the whole of his tiny pulsing heart and energy
into the sweet outpourings, and it was always a joy to see this lovely
little bird on the topmost spray of pink almond blossom telling the
world how sweet Life was.
In the spring-time the Serin Finch indulges in a strange and
grotesque flight. While singing its song it sails slowdy from tree top
to tree top beating the air with its wings and looking very much like
a bat doing a " slow-motion" flight.
In appearance the Serin Finch is something like a Siskin but is
more yellow, and can at once be distinguished when in flight by the
bright yellow rump. When seen from below in the sunlight the bird
looks very much like a Canary, as only the yellow breast is visible.
The birds haunt the olive and almond orchards and are seldom
found far from cultivated lands.
The Great Tit is found in the gardens, and its presence is at once
detected by its strange call-note. This bird seems a distinct sub-species
of the common European kind, for the bird found in Sicily seems to
be far brighter in colour than those at home ; in fact, one would
almost call the Sicilian bird brilliant.
In the spring time the almond blossom which makes the hillsides
seem as though they were clothed in pink snow seems to be a very
great attraction to the smaller birds, which may be seen in flocks
making a minute search of the flowers, and sometimes on a warm
morning will be heard a wonderful avian concert; a hundred
voices seem to swell the anthem, Serin Finches, Goldfinches,
Linnets, Chaffinches, Warblers, etc., seem to gather together to sing
in unison.
The Crag Martin is a resident of Sicily, and on sunny mornings
flocks may be seen skimming the face of the cliffs snapping up small
insects. On dull days, of which in that congenial climate there are
but few, they may be seen flying low over the herbage of the waste
lands, picking up insects as they fly off the plants.

This bird is similar to the Sandmartin but has white markings
near the end of the tail.
In March flocks of Alpine Swifts arrived and were seen in small
flocks searching and hawking for insects around the face of the
precipitous cliffs overhanging the sea. These birds have a very
remarkable song which is uttered on the wing usually late in the evening
or in the early morning, and very lovely it sounds when a flock sing
together. The Alpine Swift is a much larger bird than the Common
Swift and is easily distinguished by the white under parts and greyish-
brown back.
Whilst in Taormina I met a young Sicilian gentleman who was a
keen aviculturist even though his methods were rather crude. He had
a large collection of Sicilian birds, including many rare Buntings and
also a number of Blue-rock Thrushes which were in very fine condition
and very tame. He told me that these birds he had reared from
nestlings. He also informed me that the birds were in great demand
amongst the peasants as song birds, a good songster fetching as much
as 200 and 300 lire ; but he also said that large numbers were killed
and eaten by the peasant children in the high mountains, who take them
from the nest and roast them on skewers over fires. One can hardly
wonder at this, as the children appear to have very little else to eat
except bread and wine, and not much of that.
What grieved me greatly was to see a great number of blinded
birds of many species in tiny cages around the walls of the room.
Signor Zuccaro explained to me in French that the peasants are in the
habit of catching small singing birds and putting out their eyes with
red hot wires, thinking that they will sing the better. This cruel
practice had been stopped by the police, and the birds which I saw
had been confiscated by the police and the owners fined. My
friend had begged that the birds be not destroyed, but given to him.
Some he had had for several years, but I should have thought it better
to have destroyed the wretched creatures, for a more pathetic sight
I have never seen than the rows and rows of tiny cages with their poor
sightless inmates. How they must have missed the golden sunlight of
lovely Sicily ; but to the inhabitants of most Roman Catholic countries
animals have no soul and therefore no feelings.

I was introduced to another person who had several Blue Thrushes
and also some Jays, and the remarkable thing was that one of the
Thrushes, which are remarkably tame, would sing part of its song and
then stop ; one of the Jays would continue the Thrush's song and in
turn stop, letting the Thrush go on. I listened to this strange duet for
some time, each bird picking up the song as soon as the other stopped.
The Blue Thrush has, by the way, a very much richer and more
melodious song than the European Thrush.
The Jay, which is found in Sicily, is smaller than the British bird,
and has the foxy red of the latter bird replaced by pale grey; the ear-
coverts also seem rather longer in the Sicilian bird. This bird is not
very common, and is only found in the high mountain forests. I had the
chance of acquiring specimens. As I had several birds then, and having
to bring them with me for nearly a week's journey in the train, I had to
refuse, much as I should have liked them.
The Stonechat is another exceedingly abundant bird, and is found
in nearly all the orchards and gardens. I rather think that the
birds were breeding when I was there in February. They are exceed-
ingly fearless little birds, and I am afraid have to pay a very heavy toll
to the native gunners in consequence. These birds also search the
almond blossom for insects.
Opposite the beautiful garden of the house where I stayed on the
seashore, was a tiny but very rocky island, covered by luxuriant
vegetation, and a pair of Lesser Kestrels were often seen sweeping
around the cliffs with remarkable grace and ease in search of suitable
prey. I think that they must have had a nest there. Another pair had a
nest in a hole on the face of a great inaccessible cliff above the house
below the town.
Bluetits are fairly common, especially in the gardens of the town,
where they are rarely disturbed by the peasant children. In fact the
number of birds in the small but very beautiful public gardens of
Taormina is amazing. I saw many species there which I never saw
elsewhere.
I have never seen the little Wrens in the gardens ; they seem to
prefer the undergrowth in the valleys by the side of the clear mountain
streams. They seem to be a very much richer brown than the
British bird.

The Wren of Sicily is a songster of no mean merit, and I have never
heard our bird sing such a full sweet song.
The Common Erancolin has been supposed to have been extinct
in Sicily for many years, but the person who keeps the blinded birds,
mentioned before, told me that it is occasionally seen, and some time ago
one was brought to him, which only lived for a day in his aviary; but
before it died it killed several other Partridges. This bird appears to
be found now only on the high forest region of Mount Etna, where it is
known to the peasants as the " King of the Quail
The beautiful Ortalan Buntings are sometimes seen in the trees of
the orchards, but one only gets a very fleeting glance of them, for they
are very quick and wary. One more often sees them in small cages
hung outside the peasants' houses. These birds somewhat resemble a
glorified Yellowhammer, but are greener on the head.
Towards the end of March the strikingly coloured Hoopoe puts
in an appearance, and solitary individuals can be seen floating from
one hillside to another, looking like giant tropical butterflies. I do
not know whether these beautiful birds remain to breed; I should rather
think that they do. One may approach within a few yards of them,
as they are strangely fearless.
Many rare Warblers are found in the spring time on the genista and
and cistus-covered hillsides by the sea, but they are of such skulking
habits that it is very difficult to identify them.
Away in the mountains the Bock Sparrow is found. It looks
something like a pale edition of a common hen Sparrow, but in the centre
of the upper breast is a spot of bright lemon yellow which at once
distinguishes it from any other bird. Though I never saw the bird in a
state of freedom as far as I know, I saw several in captivity belonging
to local bird fanciers, though I think it is seldom kept by the peasants
owing to its lack of song.
Above the garden, flving around the face of the cliff, I occasionally
saw pairs of Alpine Choughs, and though looking rather like Jackdaws,
they can at once be told by their extremely light and bouyant flight,
which is different from any other member of the Crow family. These
birds are by no means common and not often seen.
The Calandra Lark is another bird very often kept by the peasants,

who delight in its rich full song. It is kept, alas, too often in a tiny
cage in which it cannot open its wings, and is fed upon seed alone.
The Skylark is also kept, at least the Sicilian sub-species which is
more heavily spotted, and seems to possess a much larger crest than the
bird known in our own isles. These, too, are usually fed upon seed
alone, with no addition of soft food.
Away in the mountains I have upon more than one occasion seen
the Black Wlieatear, one of the largest of the Wheatears, and it is soon
distinguished by its pied plumage, especially by the snow w r hite rump,
which is very conspicuous when the bird is in flight. This bird is the
inhabitant of the warmer regions of Europe, and is seldom seen farther
north than the south of France. It is also found in Algeria.
Another very beautiful Wheatear found only in the most southern
parts of Europe, including Sicily, is the Busset Wheatear. This bird
I sometimes saw in the meadows of w r ild flowers by the seashore. It is
a very striking looking bird, a typical " Desert Chat ", having the pale
Isobelline colouring of the North African Wheatears. I have also seen
the Black-eared Wheatear, a bird very similar to the foregoing, differing
only in having the throat white instead of black.
Around the cliffs above the garden lived a few pairs of Rock Doves,
which were exceptionally shy, and I think few people knew of
their existence besides myself. These birds haunt the precipitous
cliffs and are seldom seen to leave them, nesting in the small caves and
on the sheltered ledges on the face of the cliff.
"CUTTY"
By Mrs. Christine Irvine
I was most interested to know that others felt the wish to read of the
commoner birds, as I too wanted to read the experiences of members
with the birds I kept.
Unfortunately I have only a failure to relate, but it was a failure
that gave me more interest and more thrills than I can tell. Last
September I was attracted by a cowering, miserable little bird alone in a
tiny cage at the back of a bird shop. It was a cock Ribbon Finch. I

Mrs. Christine Irvine --" Cutty "
carried him home and it took him many days to settle down with two
Cordons, two Avadavats, and a Combasson in a small bird room withu?
roomy cage with open door to sleep and eat in. He began to cheer up
when I gave him a millet spray and seeding grasses, and when
he had lived with me about three weeks he started to explore a
cocoanut; and one day to my delight he sat on top of it and, turning
from side to side, he " sang Little by little he got to know me and
greeted me with his strange warble, and always when I went to see
him first thing in the morning. His joy was most amusing when
I put into the cage a small box labelled 44 Valuable Wild Birds " with a
small hole cut in the front. He sat in. it with just his head out, turning
from side to side, warbling his joy and telling the bird world that
the box was his. He slept in it at night, and finally carried up
a little hay and feathers and made a rough nest. I could not get
him a mate, and no bird ever wanted one more. At last I procured a
hen, and 44 Cutty's " cup of joy overflowed. He took her to his box,
which no other bird had ever dared approach, and there they sat side
by side nearly all day. He dressed her neck and 44 kissed " her every
few minutes. He was too excited to eat and flung the seed all over
the place to let off steam. He was her devoted slave and always dressed
her feathers after the bath, while she stood quite still and never
attempted to dress herself.
Three months went by and then they started to build ; hundreds of
feathers were carried to the box. Five eggs were laid and all went well
until the day before they were due to hatch. I had enough food to feed a
regiment of baby Cutthroats, and I did not know how to wait to know
I had babies ; but alas ! the cock Cordon had started to build also, and
he became pugnacious and wanted the entire room to himself, and he
chased 44 Mrs. Cutty " all over the bird room. She showed great fear
and would not return to the nest, but slept close to her husband for
protection ; and although next day the cock returned to the eggs, all
the chicks were dead.
Shortly afterwards they started again, and this time three babies
hatched out and lived ten days. I fed them on eight mealworms cut up
night and morning and soaked seed, but the mother preferred some
cod liver oiled seed that I was feeding up the hen Avadavat with, and

went into their cage to take it. I think it must ha\ e been too rich as they
all died. The smell became terrible and both parents sat on the nest
together some nights and I feared they would get poisoned, so I took
down the. nest and looked. One babe was alive. I removed the
dead, but they deserted the last one and it died too.
Again they built and laid nine eggs.
At this point in their history I became ill and had to give up all
birds for a time. Mr. Appleby took them to live in his beautiful aviaries,
and he reports to me that there has been no further building. " Cutty "
was so tame that he would take mealworms from my foot and he
tried to take my hair for his nest. I never found him interfere with
the other birds, in fact the cock Cordon ruled the entire bird room,
and " Cutty " always had to wait until he had bathed each morning.
He had winning ways and I grew very fond of him, and I am deter-
mined to try again and breed a Cutthroat one day, and if I do it will
have more value in my eyes than if I possessed the rarest bird that any-
one could give me.
I may add that I gave the parents a dish of " Stamina " each morning
when the young came and they ate it greedily, as well as the cod liver
oiled seed. I have found that all my birds love " Stamina " and keep
very fit.
[It may be that such foods tend to over-stimulate the birds, with the
result that they wish to go to nest before the young are reared and thus
neglect them. --Ed.]

Mr. Frank Finn's letter " The Case of the Kagu " is of much interest,
for this is one of the most interesting birds in the world, and it would
be a catastrophe if it were allowed to become extinct. It has been bred
in captivity in Australia, and in this country success was nearly, but
not quite, achieved by Mr. Whitley. At the Zoo the single and very
beautiful egg has been laid on two occasions to my knowledge.

Avicultural Notes
The Kagu is confined to the island of New Caledonia, and is one of
those unique types which has no near relations, though it can claim
distant relationship with the Cranes, Bails, and probably the Sun
Bittern. About the size of an ordinary fowl, though with longer legs,
it is of a light slate grey, with red bill and legs and a beautiful flowing
crest, which at times is erected. The wings are beautifully barred with
white, rufous, and black, but these markings are only visible when it
opens its wings, as it occasionally does during playful gambols.
This species is a very slow breeder. One egg forms the clutch, and
if this is hatched the young bird will be the only one reared by its
parents in the year. A species with such habits can only increase very
slowly under the most favourable conditions, and if persecuted is certain
to decrease very rapidly. It is incapable of flight so has no chance
against wandering dogs or other predaceous animals.
Surely here is a case where some wealthy person might come for-
ward and try to save a most interesting, beautiful, and unique species,
by planting it in some locality where it would thrive and be safe.
Mr. Whitley's partial success, a young bird being actually hatched,
suggests that complete success might be achieved in this country, but
it would be certain in a warmer climate given other suitable conditions.
Excitement was caused amongst students of rare British birds by
the appearance of an example of the Buff-backed Heron or Cattle Egret
in Devonshire, as there are only one or two authenticated records of
the appearance of this species in this country. But the bird that has
made such a stir is almost certainly from Mr. Ezra's collection. Five
were set free but two of these wandered. One was reported at
Godaiming, and the other has apparently got as far as Devonshire.

THE CASE OF THE KAGU
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998488071428572" page_id="56211766"  page_num="249" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I find the paper on the Kagu to which I alluded (Avicultural
Magazine, 1930, p. 137) is in La Nature for 1928 (No. 2777&amp;gt;
January 15), p. 70. It is by Monsieur J. Eisbec, from notes furnished
by M. Guenant and illustrated by photographs by M. Pognon.
These show (1) the old birds with raised crests and expanded wings,
hiding the young, and (2) similarly posed, but further apart, revealing
the chick squatting on its hocks. According to the notes of M. Guenony,
the breeder, the young bird is what may be called semi-active ; it can
move about when first hatched, but not much ; and appears usually to
squat, taking occasional short quick runs and flopping down suddenly.
Both parents feed it, but the cock continues his attentions for a long
time, the hen soon leaving the young. The cock appears also to sit on the
single egg at night, the hen by day. A good many Kagus have been
kept captive in New Caledonia at Noumea, but do not breed, at any rate
as a rule ; Australian aviculturists have also bought many at high
prices. So, though neglected dogs are, as the present article states, the
chief agents in the approaching extinction of this quaint bird, the sole
member of its family, aviculture owes it a service. Kagus were ad-
vertised only this year by one of our dealers, and the Zoo has several.
Is it too much to hope that a pair or two may be liberated in some spot
that is not an " Isle of Dogs ? " Flightless, they need no pinioning nor
aviaries, and could probably support themselves anywhere w&amp;apos;here
drought and frost did not prevent their procuring worms, etc. They
are good vermin destroyers as w r ell as scientifically interesting, and it
seems a pity that money should be spent wholesale in preserving mere
species, which are generally only in danger locally, while a type is being
allowed to disappear which rivals the Dodo and Solitaire in uniqueness.

to own a little Canary Winged Parrakeet (Brotogerys chiriri) -
with which I can do anything in reason. It will sit on my finger,
run up to my shoulder, and seem perfectly contented ; with other men
it is quite friendly, too. Let a woman, however, come near it and it
immediately turns into a perfect spitfire, absolutely beside itself with
rage.
Now my parlour-maid, who is exceedingly fond of birds and looks
after some of them when I am away, cannot go near it as long as I
am at home ; but strange to say, when I was at the Ornithological
Congress in Amsterdam this year, it seemed to recognize the fact
that it had to depend on her for its living and it let her put the seed
vessels into the cage, etc., without offering to bite or fly at
her all the time I was away. Immediately I came home it
started its antics again, chattering and biting as hard as ever. I think
the above shows that we must give the parrot family credit
for considerable brain power, otherwise the Canary Wing would never
have changed its tactics in the manner described above. Lord Tavistock
in his book refers to a bird of this species that became devoted to two
people and was most hostile to the rest of the world.

Sir,-- Since reading Mr. Gurney's second article on the " Plumed "
Jay it has occurred to me that possibly a few remarks on this bird
and another of the same family might not be amiss.
To begin with, in American literature these birds are known as
Magpie-Jays and both species are found in Western Mexico and South
into Central America.
The coloured plate in the April, 1928, Avicultural Magazine
depicting Mr. Gurney's pair of birds is not of a pair at all but of two
hens. The difference between the two is very evident if they were
shown side by side. The cock bird is considerably larger and has a
strongly recurved crest which usually is carried forward so that the
point is directly in front of the beak. The other noticeable difference
is that the gorget line of the breast is much narrower, being not much

more than a heavy line in comparison with that of the female. We
have a true pair in the Zoo here in Chicago.
It seems strange to me that no mention is made in aviculture of
the other far more beautiful member of this family--the Collie's
Magpie-Jay (Calocitta collii). This spectacularly beautiful bird has
a longer and bushier crest and in fully adult specimens has the entire
throat and chest black, as in a magpie. The wings are darker than in
the other species, of a greenish-blue, and the gorgeous tail is of
a hyacinthine colour, with the outer feathers black with white tips.
The tail is similar to C. formosa but longer. The head is mostly black
with rich blue on cheeks and nape and a white line from lower part of
beak. In immature birds the chest is much like that of the hen of
the other species. I have a beautiful mounted specimen in my collection
in which the crest is fully 3J inches long, black with blue tips, and the
tail is 19 inches in length.

BARBARY DOVES AT LIBERTY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994455647058824" page_id="56211769"  page_num="252" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- While not wishing to discourage anyone from experimenting
with a cheap and attractive bird, I am afraid that most people will
find that success with Barbary Doves at liberty is only of a temporary
nature. The birds stay well enough--that is to say, if they do not
belong to a strain that has been so much cage-bred that it has lost the
power of collected flight--but they are apt to feel the cold and wet of
winter, and they usually end by being exterminated by vermin,
especially Brown Owls. The Owls may leave them alone at first, but
once they discover how good they are and how easily killed, they
quickly make a clean sweep of the lot.
Probably the success recorded in the July number is due to the
fact of the birds always roosting in Irish yews. The peculiarly dense
cover provided by these trees would be just the thing to protect the
Doves from winter cold and nocturnal enemies, but not all gardens
have Irish yews, and not all Doves have the sense to make use of
such thick shrubs, even when they exist.

In December, 1928, Mr. C. S. Webb, on bis return from a collecting
trip to Portuguese East Africa, brought several specimens of the
subject of our plate : a Weaver which differs considerably in its habits
from the majority of the Ploceince. There are some seven species of
this African genus, and they live in pairs in the forests, feeding almost
entirely upon insects, though doubtless they occasionally take seed
and perhaps berries. The sexes are alike in colour, and there is no
" eclipse " plumage. They are said to be fond of climbing in thick
creepers and the foliage of trees in search of insects. They build large,
coarsely-woven nests shaped like long-necked retorts, frequently
situated at a considerable height and often overhanging a stream
or open space. S. stictifrons occurs in East Africa from the Rovuma
River to the Shire River.

254 Capt. H. S. Stokes--A Tour in France
A TOUR IN FRANCE
By Capt. H. S. Stokes
I. Cleres
When our President invited me to go for a motor trip with himself
and the Editor it may be imagined I was not slow to accept.
We motored up from Dieppe to Cleres, to stay with Monsieur
Delacour and his mother, who presides charmingly over this beautiful
fifteenth century chateau. It comprises the chateau itself, a beautiful
old rose-red brick Manor House linked to the chateau by a gallery, and
the church, all grouped together. They stand in a narrow valley, with
steep and partially wooded sides. The garden, a happy blending of
English and French, and the park merge into one another. And
through them winds a river which broadens out at one point into a lake
with two wooded islands in it. It is a spot full of peace and charm,
made absolutely complete by the apparently unrestricted movements
of the birds and beasts which live there. It seemed to be the fulfilment
of a dream to me, and of the point which I have ventured to stress
before, that beauty and bird-keeping should go together. There is
no jarring note of ugliness to distract the eye, no wire netting even to
be seen, and yet the supervision of the birds at liberty is complete, and
their health and comfort carefully attended to. M. Delacour is to be
envied and congratulated on his taste and ingenuity in planning it all.
We cannot all have fifteenth century chateaux and parks, but I am
sure a great deal more might be done to render our birds more attractive
by setting them in good surroundings on however small a scale.
From every window of the chateau there is something to enjoy :
a flock of fifteen Flamingoes, Egyptian, Buddy, and Chilian, come out
of the water and dance on the lawn for us like a corps de ballet . With
them also are the rarest geese, four Bed-breasted and a pair of Maned
Geese of Australia, and also the choicest Ducks : two pairs of White-
backed (Thallasornis leuconota ) from Madagascar, queer little creatures
of Grebe-like form ; Binged, Cinnamon, and Chestnut-breasted Teal,
Bahama Ducks, Madagascar White-eyes, and Bajah Shelduck.
A clump of silver limes forms a natural bower for a piece of statuary
and marks the spot where the river tumbles over some rocks down to a
lower level. And here a wire netting fence, cunningly concealed,
divides the garden from the park. This is here a lush green water meadow

with a mown path along the water's edge. It abounds with beautiful
creatures : a flock of twenty-one Demoiselle Cranes, two Crowned
Cranes, Cattle Egrets, Madagascar and Abyssinian Guinea Fowl, and
Screamers. Chinese Water Deer concealed in the long grass bound
away suddenly at our approach, yet as we pause to look at the Ducks
we are not alone, for three tame Stanley Cranes and two very tame
Black Buck follow us and allow us to stroke them. The waterfowl are
in multitudes : five Emperor Geese, Abyssinian Blue-winged, Ruddy and
Ashy-headed, Ross's Snow and Orinoco Geese, and Coscoroba Swans.
Of Ducks there are Indian and American Comb Ducks (the latter
very handsome in black and white with purple wings), Fulvous Tree
Ducks, of which several have been bred this year, a single Eyton's
Tree Duck, White-eyed Pochards, Barrow's Golden Eyes, Scaup,
Common Scoters, South African Shelduck, and very many others.
I almost forgot six Eider Ducks, which laid last year.
There is a swishing of branches among the tall poplars on one of
the islands. It is the Gibbons, a pair of the rare white-cheeked species
(Hylobates leucogenys) from Laos. They have been there on the island
four winters, absolutely loose, and with no shelter except the evergreen
trees and a sleeping box. I do not suppose the wonderful gymnastic
feats of these splendid anthropoid apes can be seen so well anywhere
else except in their native country : they swing or jump incredible
distances high above one's head.
M. Delacour has since brought home several more, and has five
loose in another part of the park, nearer the chateau. Some of these
are the all-black species (Hylobates concolor ) of which the adult female
is sandy brown with a circular patch of black on the head. Most of
them are quite tame and swing fearlessly down into one's arms to be
petted and to examine one's pockets. Truly a unique sight. A pair
of Black-necked Swans with young have an enclosure to themselves,
and so have some Steamer Ducks.
You next look upwards behind the chateau to steeply rising ground
with clumps of trees and green grassy glades and see Wild Turkeys,
White Rheas, Reeve's Muntjacs, Bennett's Wallabies, and a herd of
Black Buck grazing peacefully. On the slopes of this hill also, hidden
among the trees, are enclosures for Brush Turkeys, Peafowl and small

deer waiting to be let out in the park. At the top are the aviaries of
small birds, a fine range of them set in their own garden. The com-
partments flanking this range are thickly planted with shrubs and the
centre ones are laid down with clipped grass, in which are pools fed
from piped lead figures. Here are two pairs of the rare Delacour's
Pheasants, five Turnstones, Bamboo and Madagascar Partridges,
Indo-Chinese White-crested Jay Thrushes, Lidth Jays, Buppell's
Starlings, Princess of Wales' Parrakeets, and a host of Budgerigars
and small Finches. M. Delacour pointed out to me a rare Crackle
(Gracupica tertia), with a grey mantle, black wings, and white body.
A very uncommon Dove was the Marquesas Island Ground Pigeon
(Columhula rufescens).
Beyond these aviaries again come the Pheasantries, row upon row
and range upon range. Their occupants are not easy to see among the
dense undergrowth : indeed it appears from what Pheasant experts
say that if you would breed Pheasants you must keep them so that
you never see them !
There are many species at Cleres : Edwards', Elliott's, Lewis', Bel's,
Berlioz, Imperial, Mikado, Soemmering's, Bornean and Vieillot's Fire-
backs, Rheinardt's and Common Argus, Germain's and Common Peacock
Pheasants. These are some of the rarest. Near these pheasantries
are some enclosures, one with Darwin's Bheas and another containing
the very rare Black-necked Crane, a dreadfully spiteful individual.
We return to the chateau by a semi-circular terrace where Parrots,
Macaws, and Cockatoos, quite loose but pinioned, play about on their
stands or on an iron fence.
Steps lead down past two charming lily pools into the gallery of
the chateau. This gallery is lined along one side with flight cages con-
taining Shamas, a Toucan, and a bevy of small Finches and Waxbills
and Sunbirds. On the opposite side under the windows are aquaria
of Japanese goldfish and semi-tropical fish, and the walls are hung with
some very clever pictures of Indo-Chinese birds, specially painted for
M. Delacour by Japanese artists.
Now we go across the lawn again in front of the chateau, and behind
a yew hedge. Here the river has been canalized and aviaries erected
over it for the rearing of young Ducks. These contained numerous

broods of young, and also adult pairs of Brazilian and Versicolor Teal
and South African Red-billed Ducks. A flight of Yellow Budgerigars
shared one of these aviaries and looked very pretty among the thick
herbage on the river bank. We cross the high road which bounds the
park and find on the other side more water enclosures for breeding
choice Geese and Ducks. Next come the farm buildings, with poultry
and Bantams for brooding Ducks and Pheasants.
There is also a series of Japanese Long-tailed Fowls. One cock with
a tail 6 ft. 6 in. long was suspended from the ceiling in an extremely
ingenious cage designed by Mr. Fooks. The tail hangs down through
a circular hole at the bottom of the cage. Other cocks were outdoors
taking their daily exercise with their tails carefully twisted and tied up
with strips of newspaper ! They reminded me of a charlady who
greeted the morning in curl papers before the age of shingling, and
I wondered if the cocks sighed to be shingled too !
Along the roadside are paddocks extending up the hill right into
the woods at the top. Some of them show from the chateau and are
devoted to animals and large Cranes. A herd of Pseudaxis Deer, a
flock of Soay Sheep which provided excellent mutton for our dinner,
several Rheas, Sarus and Eastern Sarus, Manchurian, White, and White-
necked Cranes. You can watch the dancing of these great Cranes
from the chateau windows by day, and listen to their calls from your
bed by night.
Another field on this slope, but hidden from sight by intervening
trees, is devoted to Pheasant rearing. Mr. Fooks uses a combination
coop and run, made all in one piece with a wire floor to exclude vermin,
and there were rows of these on close-cut grass in a wired enclosure.
All the broods with their foster-mother Bantams are let out of the
coops in the afternoon together in the wure enclosure and are driven
in again at dusk. We saw such treasures as sixteen young Mikado
Pheasants, Soemmerrings, Imperial, Edwards', and some Elliott's, and a
quantity of thriving young Chukor Partridges.
I was surprised to learn that none of these young, not even the
Partridges, had received any live food in their early stages. Ants' eggs
in the quantities necessary for so many chicks would be difficult to get
and to keep, so the experiment was tried this year of rearing them

entirely on custard for the first ten days, and this has proved very
successful. Young Ducklings also are fed on small biscuit meal given
almost soaking wet and mixed with duckweed. No Ducklings except
divers are allowed to go into water for nearly a month and even then a
careful watch is kept to see that they dry properly after their first swim.
The appearance of the birds spoke well for this treatment.
I had almost forgotten Monsieur Delacour's greenhouse aviary,
which he has already described in a past issue of this Magazine.
But on account of its great beauty it must be referred to again,
as many private aviculturists and more especially Zoological and
Botanical Gardens might copy it with advantage and make an
exceedingly attractive feature of it. It is a structure perhaps 40 feet
long, heated to about 70* Fahrenheit, and planted throughout with
tropical plants. There are no stages and no pots, all the plants being
planted on low retaining walls of stone round the two sides and end.
It is divided into two across the middle by fine wire netting which is
all but invisible. On the near side you sit among the luxurious tropical
growth of climbing and flowering and foliage plants and look at the
birds flying loose in the wired portion, similarly planted, and rather
heavily draped with climbing growths. The ground is paved round a
narrow canal-like pool in which are blue water-lilies, and the little
fountain which feeds it adds music to the call of the birds. The warm,
moist atmosphere seems to suit the birds chosen for it excellently,
the particular feature being that the Sunbirds retain the red of their
plumage perfectly, whereas under ordinary cage and aviary conditions
they fade to yellow. We saw there Natal and White-shouldered
Cossyphas, a Hooded Pitta, different Sugar-birds and small Tanagers,
Pulchella Sunbirds, Hardwicke's and green Fruit-suckers, and the rare
Crimson-winged Babbler (Ganulax milnei).
Finally in a ruined tower, a very early relic of a former fortress or
castle, is the Owls' aviary, inhabited by three Virginian Eagle Owls,
It seemed quite natural to find the Owls there, fitting exactly and
recalling instantly the lines of Gray's Elegy :--
" Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient, solitary reign."

By J. Delacour
It is doubtful if there are, anywhere in the world, so many living
creatures of all sorts assembled in fifteen acres of ground. I have visited
and described most of the collections of living birds in the world, but
to give an idea of that of Mr. H. Whitley is almost an impossible task.
In August of this year I had the privilege of visiting the Primley
Zoo for two days in company with my friends Sir David and Mr. A. Ezra,
and enjoyed Mr. Whitley's kind hospitality. But to gain an adequate
idea of his installations and to study all his birds would take weeks.
Therefore I can only attempt to give here a vague impression of what
I saw and casually mention the more interesting species that I
noticed. At the beginning it must be said that the wild birds, the only
ones that come within the scope of this Magazine, form but about one-
fourth of Mr. Whitley's collections. He owns also many mammals of
all sorts, wild and domestic, large numbers of pure-bred poultry,
and thousands of domestic Pigeons of many breeds, amphibions, fishes,
and a valuable series of hardy and stove plants.
The Primley Zoo occupies a hill opposite the house. With the
exception of one large and a few smaller aviaries, nicely arranged
with ornamental plants and flowers, the innumerable houses, shelters,
bird-rooms, flights, and enclosures have been established without
sacrificing the practical side to the artistic aspect. They are sub-
stantially and comfortably built of wooden frames and panels, with
brick foundations, glass and corrugated iron roofs. There is a central
lawn and many paths between the different houses and enclosures.
There are rows and rows of aviaries of all sizes, all with large
indoor shelters, mostly covered with glass ; in these shelters there
are inner cages ; other large indoor aviaries can be seen from the
outside through windows. Different bird-rooms are furnished with
cages and fixed aviaries, as well as several greenhouses, some of them
being right away and attached to Mr. Whitley's house. The arrange-
ments are always practical and clean. The birds are very well
looked after and fed. There are also different enclosures, and in a
hollow a large pond and a large flight cage. The Zoo is constantly

being enlarged, and many aviaries are being built now. All I can do
now is to mention the more striking birds of the collection, but it
must be understood that all the common and semi-rare species
usually imported are present, sometimes in great numbers.
There are a few Rheas, grey and wdiite, Emus, one cock Somali
Ostrich, and a Cassowary (C. altijugus).
Waders are numerous : Herons, Ibises of many species, among which
a lovely pair of Pileated ( Pilerodius pileatus) ; Kagus ; Sarus, Lilford's,
White Asiatic, Stanley's, Demoiselle, and Crown Cranes ; Flamingoes ;
Screamers ; Cariamas, and various Rails, among which Limnopardalis
sanguinolentus has bred several times, as well as the Australian Thick-
knees (Burhinus grallarius) which were illustrated in the Magazine
for October, 1929. Ducks, Geese and Swans are not very numerous,
and there are no rarities amongst them.
Pigeons and Doves are numerous, but without many striking
specimens, except a nice pair of Macropygia emiliana and some Olive
Pigeons.
There are lots of common and Black-shouldered Peafowls roaming
about the estate ; otherwise Pheasants are very few, the best being a
cock Argus. Partridges, on the contrary, are many ; the fine Black-
headed Partridge ( Alectoris melanocephala) of Arabia has bred at Primley
and crossed freely with the Chukar. There are also Guineafowls, Guans,
and Curassows, among which Salvin's Razor-bills are noteworthy.
Parrots and Parrakeets are the best feature in Mr. Whitley's Zoo,
and he owns the best and most important collection of these interesting
birds which exists at present. According to species, these are kept
indoors or out of doors, in cages or aviaries, always with suitable accom-
modation. All the common, semi-rare, or rare species usually or seldom
imported are present; among the more interesting ones I noticed

are noticeable Crimson-winged X Rock Peplars, Yellow-bellied X
Bulla, Barnard X Bauer, Yellow-bellied X Rosella, and all possible
crosses between Peach-faced, Masked, Fischer's, Black-cheeked, and
Nyasa Lovebirds. Birds of prey are numerous and there are many
Owls; European Eagle Owls bred three young ones last year. A special
mention must be made of several pairs of African Pigmy Falcons
(Poliohierax), kept in indoor aviaries, which have laid. There are
Burmese and Port's Rollers (the latter have bred), Touracous (Turacus
donaldsoni, Gallirex porphyreolophus and chlorochlamys, Corylhoixoides
leucogaster, Gymnoschizorhis sp.), Ground Hornbills, various Toucans,
one Greater Ani, Motmots and Jackasses.
Passerine Birds are very numerous, and I noticed pairs of Wallace's,
Twelve-wired, and Red Birds of Paradise ; Australian Ravens and many
other Corvidae ; numerous Starlings, with curious hybrids, Burchell's X
Baywings and Superb X Royal; Troupials ; Weavers, Waxbills, and
Finches of very many species, Tanagers, Sugar-birds, etc.
There are lots of hybrids, as hybrid breeding in birds and animals
is one of Mr. Whitley's special objects.
I fear that the above notes are very vague and convey a very poor
idea of the wealth of Mr. Whitley's collection. We hope he may
sometime find the time to give us details on his numerous birds.
A VISIT TO THE KESWICK AVIARIES
By J. Delacour
For nine years I had not been to see my friend Mr. G. H. Gurney's
aviaries. I was delighted, when last August I arrived at Keswick,
to find that their number had more than doubled. The birds are
numerous, varied, and interesting, and they look all the better for being
shown in pretty aviaries, most of them well and lightly built of iron,
with comfortable shelters, many of which are heated. The outdoor
flights are turfed and planted with shrubs and creepers, and look very

pretty. The whole installation is beautifully kept and one of the
cleanest that I have ever seen ; it is the more wonderful that there are
numerous birds of prey, and Waders, which are very difficult to keep
tidy. This and the perfect condition of all the birds reflects great credit
upon the head-keeper, Mr. Martin. The aviaries are built in three groups :
The oldest one is in a small garden surrounded by walls. There is a central
path, on the right side of which is a long and large aviary inhabited by
Black-necked Ibises, Cattle Egrets, Oyster-catchers, Ruffs and Reeves
and other small Waders, Alpine Choughs, Crested Pigeons, and
Dominican Cardinals. On the left side one finds six smaller aviaries,
all with heated shelters, and of various sizes ; the first one is stocked
with many small birds, mainly Finches and Weavers, one White-
crowned Plover and a rare South American Whimbrel ; the next aviary
is devoted to a pair of Blue Occipital Pies; then come three aviaries
with many small birds, Tanagers, Waxbills, etc., and the last one,
very roomy, with three Tiger Bitterns.
Facing the paths are five more aviaries with various Budgerigars
and Lovebirds, Sun-Bitterns, Shamas, various Australian Finches,
Yellow-wattled Plovers and San Bias Jays.
The second group of aviaries, also surrounded by walls, is newer
and larger. There are the different dependencies and food stores, and
also several very convenient indoor accommodations where big birds
can be shut in at night. These birds in the day-time walk about the
garden and paths between the aviaries : there are pairs of Dusky
Trumpeters, Razor-bill Curassows, Pileated Guans, a Screamer, an
American Wood Ibis, and various Guinea Fowls. On the right one finds
a small house, with a glass roof ; four indoor aviaries communicate
with as many outdoor flights. There live different Glossy and Royal
Starlings, Rosy Pastors and a female Icterus gularis ; a pair of Bald-
headed Starlings, Blue Grosbeaks, Mesias ; Swainson's Lorikeet, one
of which can talk ; White-breasted and Green-billed Toucans. Two
other indoor aviaries are used for a Motmot and Grey Bulbuls ( Micro -
scelis psaroides ), while cages are inhabited by Pink-eared Crested Bulbuls,
a Malachite Sunbird, a Bengal Pitta, Blue Sugar-birds, a pretty Blue-
headed Organist (Tangara nigricollis ) and various South African Wax-
bills, Leclancher's and Nonpareil Buntings.

On the left a very nice aviary, with a little pool, stones and rock
plants, has been erected inside a greenhouse ; there are males of the
lovely Elliot's Pitta, Bell-bird, Fairy Blue-birds, several Tanagers and
Bulbuls. In cages, a few small Parrots, one very old Golden-fronted
Bulbul, a Black-collared Barbet, and a very fine Crimson-breasted
Shrike that Mr. Gurney has had for four years. It is to be noted that
both Elliot's Pitta and the Shrike have kept very bright their green
and red hues.
Further up, there are three large compartments, the first one with
Donaldson's Touracous (one on its nest), European Rollers, Black
Crakes, Spotted Francolins and a rare Tanager (Buarremon hrunneinucha );
the second, with four Mexican Plumed Jays; the third, with different
Starlings and a Lilac-breasted Roller.
Facing these aviaries, there is a wide turfed path, on the left of
which is a long flight inhabited by Manchurian Eared Pheasants,
Budgerigars, and a Cocoi Heron, which is quite harmless to small birds,
to my amazement!
On the other side, a row of nine fine new aviaries, of various
sizes, contain many birds, among which I noticed Common Francolins,
Cuban Quails, Kagus, Sclater's Crown-Pigeons on the nest, Ruppell's
Glossy Starlings which have just deserted three fledglings, different
Marsh-birds, Plumed Ground Doves, Cherry Finches, Spreos, Bleeding-
heart Pigeons, Crimson-winged, Pennant's and other Parrakeets. The
central compartment, very roomy, is inhabited by Scarlet and White
Ibises, Lesser Egrets, and Gray's Pond Herons ; in spite of the habits
of its occupants, the shrubs and grass are perfectly clean and nice, and
I think this is a wonderful achievement.
At a short distance, in a field, stands the Hawks aviary; the roof
is half full, half wired on ; only the front is wired, the rest being full
wooden panels. There are seven cages, all 18 ft. deep, with different
widths ; one sees the following birds : one pair of American Bald
Eagles, one Red-tailed Hawk, and one Southern Chilian Sea-Eagle
(Geranocetus australis) ; a Busarellus nigricollis ; one pair of Montagu's
Harriers, in fine condition; a pair of Kolb's Vulture and a Chimachima;
one King Vulture ; a Jackal Buzzard, bred at Keswick seventeen years
ago, and a Caracara.

There are also three large enclosures with White Rheas, Lilford's,
Sarus, White Asiatic, Crown, and Demoiselle Cranes, Bernicle, Brent,
Bar-headed and Magellan Geese, and Silver Pheasants, and a pond,
in the garden, with about thirty Ducks: Mandarin, Carolina,

Many exhibits at the Poultry Congress held at the Crystal Palace
this summer were of general avicultural interest, notably some hybrid
Jungle-fowl and hybrid Guinea-fowls shown in the Italian section.
The Jungle-fowls, which were not noted by name in the catalogue,
were two trios, one first-cross between the Green Junglefowl and the
Red, and the other bred from this cross mated back to the Red ; so it
was stated on their tickets. The first-cross trio were not exactly like
the hybrids of this cross bred at the Zoo some years ago : the cock had
the comb serrated much as in the pure Red, though he had the Green's
dewlap and no wattles ; ear-lobes were present, and all these bare parts
were red, as in the Zoo birds. The plumage was much more bronzy
and less purple in the glossy parts--neck and tail--and showed some
chestnut, though the Zoo birds did not. The secondaries were edged
with this colour, and the upper breast and flanks were chestnut tipped
with black. The tail was very tightly " whipped up " with short
side-hangers, as in the Grey Sonnerat cock. The hens inclined to the
Red hen in their feathering more than the Zoo birds did, and chiefly
differed from it in having no definite neck-hackle, the Zoo hybrid hens
showing a distinct inclination to the Green bird's markings. The bare
patches indicating ear-lobes were white.
The cock of the second cross, i.e. three-quarter Red, was very like
a pure Red, but had shorter neck-hackle with broad purple-black
central stripes, and purple-glossed black secondaries ; his breast had
a narrow chestnut edging to its black feathers at the upper part, and his
tail was purple. His wattles were rather small and he had a small

dewlap, but otherwise the rather hen-like hackle and the large amount
of purple sheen were all that would attract attention. The hens looked
like Red hens of the purest wild type, and I don't think would ever have
been taken as crossed, except that perhaps the black stippling on their
partridge feathers was a bit coarser than it should have been.
The hybrid Guinea-fowl shown were between Common and Mitred
and Common and Tuft-billed. In both cases the Common dominated,
except that the neck-feathers were speckled up to the bare part, though
with a sort of haze or wash of the Common Guinea-fowl's self-colour
there. The head-points were more like those of the Common Guinea-
fowl, except that the wattles were in both cases merely tipped with
red, and were more or less decidedly washed with blue, most so in the
Mitre cross, which also had a dewlap like the Mitre, but of not so rich a
blue. But the pure Common Guinea-fowls in this Italian exhibit were
also dewlapped, the dewlap being dark purplish in most, but flesh-
coloured in the self-buffs (which were very pale cream), the whites,
and the self-pale-blues, which had most of the plumage very prettily
laced with pale violet. The hybrids with the Tuft-billed Guinea-fowl
showed a spiky wart on the nose in place of the tuft of bristles, larger
and more spiky in the male. These were bred from the " lilac "
variety of the Common Guinea-fowl, and showed the same shade of
ground-colour. A Vulturine Guinea-fowl naturally came in for a lot
of interest and admiration, and all must be much indebted to Pro-
fessor Ghighi for this most instructive exhibit, which included pure-
bred Mitred and Tuft-billed Guinea-fowls, and also Crested.
In the Italian stall or stand upstairs were two copies of statuettes
of the Roman Imperial period between the first and fourth century
a.d. representing a crested cock and hen, much resembling the Old
English Hornet, which was photographed in The Feathered World
this year--that is to say, the crest was well though not heavily
developed, and not a mere tuft or tassel, such as occurs in Game and in
Indian " bazaar " fowls at times, and was accompanied by a two-
horned comb. There was no beard, and so the wattles were of normal
size. I had no idea that crested fowls of a definite breed went so far
back as this in human history.
I have often thought that a breed of fowls, of economic merit,

but hardly differing from the Red Jungle-fowl except in enlarged size,
would be ideal; being of the natural colour it would not look out of
place in a park, wood, or shrubbery, or among fancy Pheasants and
Waterfowl. Such a breed appeared at the Congress in the shape of
three trios of Danish " Landhens " (which I suppose means barndoor
fowls) ; they looked very like old English Black-Red Game, except
that their ear-lobes were white, giving a very smart appearance ;
the legs were blue. As I suppose they are not so fierce as Game,
and presumably lay a good many of the eggs Denmark sends us,
this would seem to be my ideal breed. The birds are not large enough
to be clumsy, and might well go in our parks as companions to Mallard,
etc., and produce plenty of eggs and chickens for hospitals, as well
as serving as fosterers for other park birds.
Among the Canadian exhibits one of two Snow Geese had a very
curious deformity--the middle toe of one foot was no longer than the
outer toes, and had the claw growing straight up. I have only once
seen a similar malformation, and that was in a Fieldfare, on sale in
a show-cage in Oxford Market, many years ago, before the War, if
not before the beginning of this century.
In the Dutch section were the best Call-ducks (happily named
" Kwakers " in Dutch) I have ever seen, as small and short-billed
as Mandarins ; it is the first time I have ever seen Call-ducks shown,
though they are common enough ; these were white. Next to them
was a trio of the queer Bow-billed or Hook-billed Ducks (" Krombeks "),
practically white Mallard with beaks bent down like a Scandaroon
Pigeon's, though not so decidedly. This breed has been supposed to
be extinct.
It is said, too, that the original Runner Duck--Darwin's Penguin
Duck--is being crossed out of existence in the East Indies, so I was
very glad to see a Javan imported lot, high-legged wiry birds, in
this section ; three were drakes and seventeen ducks. At least two
of the latter were white, and one was buff and white with some black
markings, but the rest looked very like a wild species ; they were
extraordinarily alike, drab ranging to fawn, with dark streaks, the
wing-bar just indicated or wanting, pinion-joints often prominent,
and black bills and feet. The drakes were in undress, but two would

evidently assume a full dress of modified Mallard type ; the third
was dark plain drab ; all had white wing-coverts and black bills and
feet. These birds, it seems, have to travel and forage as they go,
being driven several miles a day for days together; thus their
peculiarities of form are adaptations.

The transfer of my collection to a new locality--the fourth change
I have had to make during a period of eighteen years--has still further
emphasized the interesting fact that for no reason that one can at present
foresee or understand certain districts suit, or disagree with, certain
kinds of birds quite apart from any question of feeding or manage-
ment. It is evident therefore that a really hardy foreign bird is not
necessarily one with which a single aviculturist has great and easy
success but rather one which is proved to do well in a large number of
different collections.
My hopes that Peasmarsh would suit everything were, with the
coming of the warm weather, quickly dispelled. Grass Parrakeets
had done badly in aviaries at Warblington, but Peasmarsh suited them
infinitely less. No care could keep an Elegant or a Turquoisine from
falling a victim to pneumonia within a few weeks and I was obliged to
transfer my stock to Keston, where, under Mr. Boosey's management,
they thrive and breed with no trouble at all. The hardy and prolific
Redrump which was one of the few birds that did well at Warblington
proved equally delicate in the same aviaries at Peasmarsh. I lost both
my breeding cocks from pneumonia and two out of three young.
Strange to say, however, Redrumps do not appear to thrive very well
at Keston either. Many-colours, on the other hand, though usually
a much more tricky proposition than Redrumps, appear to do well at
Peasmarsh in the same aviaries as they failed to thrive in at Warblington.
I got three imported ones in the early spring and all are alive and well.&amp;apos;
Although I had one sad pneumonia loss among my Aprosmictine Parra-
keets in the shape of the oldest of the lovely Sula Island X Crimson-
wing hybrids, Aprosmictine and Polyteline Parrakeets seem to thrive

in their new quarters. Australian Kings did very badly at Warblington,
the hens usually getting ill while laying and seldom living any length
of time. This year both my hens laid large clutches and incubated
them, and only the fact that the cocks happen to be useless birds
spoiled by long caging prevented more interesting results. Barrabands
at Warblington would not do at all in the movable aviaries and only
maintained a precarious existence in the Black Cockatoo aviaries by
dint of frequent visits to the hospital. At Peasmarsh they have been
back in the movable aviaries through the most dangerous, i.e. the summer,
months with as yet no illness at all. Gouldian Pinches did badly at
Warblington and even worse at Woburn. Peasmarsh seems to suit
them. I got four out of a fast-dying lot of new arrivals, and a cock and
two hens, together with an acclimatized cock obtained to replace the
one casualty, are now in the best of health.
Breeding results have been poor, the birds being upset by the late
move and disturbance by workmen right through May. The only
really nice thing--a lutino Ringneck from the same lutino-bred parents
that produced a lutino some years ago--dying of sunstroke a few days
after leaving the nest. Its green brother or sister is still alive. Another
pair of lutino-breds produced one green young one which was reared
by the hen alone as the cock has the habit of murdering his babies as
soon as they hatch. The interesting thing about this bird is that
it is a fine, well-developed, normal youngster whereas both parents,
which were bred in small fixed aviaries, are defective, and I only kept
them because of their pedigree and good constitutions. The cock
is very small and never grows proper feathers at the back of his neck :
the hen is also small and has a deformity of the wings which prevents
her from rising in flight should she get down on to the ground.
In the spring I obtained what I took to be a true pair of Long-
tailed Parrakeets (P. longicauda), a most elegant species whose
one serious fault is its great sensitiveness to cold. The birds did
unusually well and achieved what I have never seen before with
Long-tails in this country--a perfect moult--reproducing the lovely
elongated feathers from which the Parrakeet takes its name ! The
" hen " alas ! also achieved something else, viz. complete male plumage
from which we learn that the young male P. longicauda , like the Plum-

headed. Parrakeet, has two distinct plumages before assuming adult
dress, the second being indistinguishable from that of the adult female.
Needless to say both cocks are now most anxious to breed !
My hen Broadbill still survives. In May I felt certain that she was
about to die as she grew very tame, allowing herself to be touched,
and she lost her appetite, but a transfer to another aviary led to a
remarkable recovery and she is now as timid and active as before.
Nothing will tempt her to vary her diet of banana and mealworms,
of both of which she eats but moderately. A rather sad loss was
sustained by the death of Mr. Squire's little Black-legged Falconet,
apparently from tuberculosis. He had lived in a flight-cage about
three years, not altogether a bad record, for the tiny tropical birds of
prey are apt to take some keeping. A very interesting new arrival
is a specimen of the rare Antipodes Island Parrakeet (Cyanorhampus
unicolor). This strange Parrakeet inhabits a small, bleak, and, I believe,
wholly treeless island far south of New Zealand where the climate is
horribly cold, wet, and foggy throughout the year. C. unicolor might
therefore prove the ideal Parrakeet for outdoor aviaries in the greater
part of these islands, but ability to enjoy the English climate may not,
I fear, carry with it an equal ability to withstand the English microbes
which attack our birds more in genial weather than in winter.
I have not yet had time to study this bird properly. She (for I
think it is a hen) is about the size of a Norfolk Island or a Rosella, and
resembles the former species in build and to some extent in voice,
but her face is more chubby and her orange eye is smaller. She can
both perch and fly. The plumage is a rather attractive mixture of
olive greens, becoming bright green on the cheeks. The beak is almost
wholly silver. As already indicated, her voice, like that of the better
known members of the genus, is of a soft murmuring nature. At present
she will touch nothing but sunflower seed.
I might add a propos of feather-plucking in Parrots that the cock
Yellow-belly who denuded himself when given an extra amount of
hemp, sunflower, and safflower and went on plucking even at liberty,
is now with the coming of the moult reclothed and respectable.

The pair were bought from Mr. Webb on 19th May and put into
a flight of about 28 X 14 feet, at one end of which there is a pond
made rather deep for a pair of Formosa Teal. At the back of this
pond, acting as a screen, and down one side is a reed bed, to prevent
the soil from washing into the water there is a sheer wall which is only
safe as long as the pond is brimful. I found some attempt at a nest
on the edge of the pond after about a week but, being disturbed when
I cleaned it out, it was forsaken. On 18th July I discovered a nest
with three eggs in it raised up about six inches off the ground among
some sedges. Taking a glance to see if there were any more eggs laid,
on 21st July, I saw a trembling mass of black fluff, a piece with a short
yellowish bill ran out of the nest; all three had hatched. On the 30th,
I saw one, for a moment, at the food dish, quite by itself. Once I did
see the cock carry a mealworm into the reeds. The hen was not now
so much in evidence. On the 6th August, when emptying the pond
one chick ran into the bottom, soon after I disturbed one at the other end
of the aviary, quite by itself. As soon as it saw me it ran to the other
end of the flight and looked about double its original size.
It was still covered with down, the quite short bill looked almost
white, the legs and toes black, the feet very large.
As food they have mealworms, a soft-food mixture, ants' eggs, and
gentles; the two latter they do not seem to eat.
On 6th August I discovered a new nest with one egg in it,
built of dead reed or bamboo leaves, a deep cup in a bush among
sedges about three feet above the ground. The egg looked about the
size and shape of that of a Wood Pigeon, of a pale whitish-brown colour
fairly thickly covered, rather more at one end, with pinkish spots.
This egg looked much more spotted than the first clutch, though they
were very difficult to see, and I did not like to pick them up.
Four eggs were laid, one every evening some time after 8.30 p.m.
Incubation began with the laying of the fourth egg on the evening of

two minutes. I think the cock sometimes took a turn on the nest,
but am not certain. At mid-day, 27th August, the hen was restless
on the nest; a few minutes afterwards I saw the cock bird carry a
mealworm into the reeds. Running round to a peep-hole I saw the
sitting bird with the mealworm in her beak bend down into the nest
and feed one of the chicks, which had hatched out by then, they can
then only have been a few hours old. Later on I saw three chicks and
one egg ; this last egg was hatched out by next morning, and the other
three had then left the nest.
The nests never seem to be used again, and the egg-shells dis-
appeared. The newly hatched chicks are covered with black down,
have a short pinkish-white bill, the iris is black (in the adults it is
bright red), the tarsi and toes are also black. The irchief characteristic
is their early independence and extreme waryness, I hardly ever saw
them with either^ parent or each other ; at ten days old I saw one
at the food dish by itself. As they grow up this wears off, and now,
15th September, the elder three young are not much more shy than
their parents. These are now nearly full grown ; their plumage lacks
the lustre of the adults. The iris, toes, and tarsus are still black.
The lower mandible is black, the upper one is pinkish-white for the
basal two-thirds then follows a narrow black band and a pinkish-
white tip. I was first able to notice this peculiar colouring at five weeks
old through glasses. The parents do bring food to the young. I saw
the cock give one of the young of the first brood a mealworm after the
second brood had hatched out. They have built a third nest but
have not laid again ; probably the cold of the last week has put them
off. The eggs are of a pale whitish-brown colour, fairly thickly covered,
more at the blunt end, with pink spots, but even through my peep-
hole they are not very easy to see. They are chiefly fed on mealworms ;
they got to like ants' eggs after a time, but they are now over. A little
soft feed, chiefly the egg, gentles when they cannot get anything else,
and the adults will eat earthworms. I now scour my gentles in flour,
which is much better than sand, as they eat the flour and that helps
the scouring.

272 Denys Weston--Foreign Finches that are easy to breed
FOREIGN FINCHES THAT ARE EASY
TO BREED

As nobody seems anxious to rush into print with information
about the more common species of foreign Finches, I will relate
my experiences.
I found Zebra Finches and Long-tailed Grass Finches hardy, easy
to breed, and lucrative. Both species are easily obtainable and cheap.
The beginner should construct a dry, mouse-proof garden aviary,
with flight, and plant lawn grass and perennial rye in the latter. Trees
and shrubs will also enhance the appearance and prove attractive to
the inhabitants. Double wire netting will prevent depredations by
cats. No heating apparatus will be required.
Stock birds should be obtained by preference from an aviculturist,
as those bred in captivity wdll prove more hardy and more likely to
reproduce their kind than freshly imported birds.
Nests should be placed in the sheltered part of the aviary. Husks,
square boxes with a hole as entrance and a perch under will prove
suitable. These boxes should be of the size of a Hartz travelling cage.
These Hartz cages also make splendid nesting receptacles if two bars
are removed and a perch or slab be provided for the birds to settle
upon.
Providing the weather is suitable, nesting will commence immediately,
the Zebras constructing two or three homes each, one of which will
eventually be selected for hatching purposes. Incubation takes about
a fortnight, and the young leave the nest in about three weeks. A
word of warning is necessary : On no account should the nests be
disturbed, or even looked at, or they will be deserted, and, if young are
present, they will be thrown out.
It is very amusing to see the parent birds feed their babies, who hold
their heads on one side whilst clamouring noisily for nourishment.
In the case of both these species the young leave the nest with
black beaks which soon colour as they moult their nest feathers. The
young Zebras are similar in colouring to the hens, but young cocks
can be picked out by a slight black streaky patch upon the chest. I

shall not attempt to describe a method of sexing Grass Finches, as I
always found this impossible.
Whilst paired I noticed that only the cocks sang their fiddle-like
song, but when separated the hens sang also. I am positive of this,
as all birds were rung.
Food should consist of canary seed, Italian white millet, and Indian
millet as a staple food. Cuttlefish, sea-sand, and green food should always
be supplied. The latter can consist of lettuce, groundsel, chickweed,
beetroot, seeding grasses, etc. No soft food is necessary when feeding
young, but house-flies killed with a patent flip will be readily accepted.
Mine used to take these from my hand. I have known other breeders
use a mixture of equal parts Osborne biscuit and hard-boiled egg.
Equal parts are rubbed well into each other with a fork.
The sexes should be separated during the winter months to prevent
loss of vitality and egg-binding through excessive breeding. I have had
as many as fifty-five young from one pair of Zebras in a year.
Nesting material is composed of short pieces of dry grass or hay,
which should be thrown upon the floor of the compartment which
contains the nest boxes. Cow hair is useful as a lining, but should be
pulled carefully apart, as I have known birds entangle their legs in a
bunch.
Success has eluded my efforts to breed these birds in cages, although
nests have been constructed and eggs laid.
Silverbills can easily be bred in cages or aviaries, but they have never
appealed to me. My friend, the late Mr. Fred Longlands, once won a
pair of these birds as special prize at a show. He placed them in a
small cage in November, and they immediately built, laid, and reared
six fine babies without any soft food, although they were newly imported.
Another friend has bred flocks of these birds in an outdoor aviary
containing many other British and foreign Finches.
I have not found other species of small foreign Finches easy to breed,
but Avadavats, Cordon Bleus, Lavenders, and Golden Breasted Waxbills
can be tried under the above conditions.

In the July issue of our Magazine our Editor asks for articles on
the more common breeding species, which I am very glad to see, because
of late I think we have had far too few detailed descriptions of how
to rear and also how to keep the common birds. Some of our older
members will remember that splendid series of articles headed " Practical
Birdkeeping " which appeared in our Magazine in 1910 to 1912, and
which was edited by Bonhote and published in book form, now out of
print and quite impossible to obtain second-hand. These and many other
articles of the very greatest interest are scattered through the back
volumes and are hard to find because there has never been published
a proper index taking in say ten years at a time, a most useful publica-
tion and which would be worth untold gold to the serious aviculturist.
Perhaps some day this will be undertaken if enough subscribers could
be got together to make it worth while. Witherby did it a few years
ago for British Birds , and most useful it has been. 1
I now want to tell the story of a really wonderful Cock Californian
Quail (Lophortyx calif or nicus). I had a lovely pair of this charming
species and in April the hen chose a corner on a shelf some 14 inches
above the ground for her nest. She scraped out a hollow and deposited
ten eggs. We put some branches round her but she refused to sit and
eventually forsook the clutch.
Towards the end of May she started to lay again in the same place,
but I had to leave home to go to the Ornithological Congress in
Amsterdam at the end of May, and when there I got a letter telling me
that the poor little hen after laying her eggs died on 3rd June. Then
the strange thing happened : the grand little cock took on the job of
incubation, and when I came home was sitting hard. Now in all my
experience the cock never sits, only the hen Quail of this species ; both
times they nested with me before the hen did all the work.
The cock sat very hard, in fact I never saw him off the nest till one

W. H. Workman--Cock Californian Quail Brooding 275
morning, to be exact Friday, 27th June, when my man and I were
going round the aviaries we looked at the nest and I, thinking the eggs
were long overdue, took one up and broke it, but it was addled (evidently
one of the first clutch). My man wanted to clear the lot out, but
fortunately I was in a bit of a hurry and told him to leave them for
the present, and this was the saving of the nest.
On Sunday evening, 29th June, I went into the aviary to see whether
some Budgerigars had enough food, and there to my great astonishment
below the shelf was the old Quail all puffed out. I went close to him to
see whether he was ill; he then moved and out rushed no less than
seven of the most lovely little Quails you ever saw. I rushed into the
house with the good news and got my maid to boil an egg as hard as
possible. We then visited the little Quails again. I must tell you that
I had this aviary boarded up six or seven inches because young
Californians can go through half-inch netting just like a jellyfish : I've
seen them do it. Well, to continue : there was, however, just one
place where they could get near the netting and, of course, they rushed
to this, and before one could say " knife " three of them were half-way
through, but with great presence of mind my maid caught them by
the heels and dragged them back to safety while I went into the house
for a piece of stout cardboard to screen off the netting. All was now
well, and the little Quails safe from escape.
Our next wonder was : would the cock bird take on the further
duties of the mother and teach the seven little ones how to feed ? My
experience of 1925 served me well, and I knew what to do, and for
the benefit of readers who may get a brood I will tell exactly how I
proceeded, but first I must tell you that the cock was simply splendid,
teaching the young to pick and brooding them all the time except
when they were actually feeding. I noted here that he had two different
call notes : one the usual note by which he always answered the female,
this he used when he wanted to brood the chicks, but when there was
any fresh feeding about such as ants' eggs, mealworms, or gentles he
used a much sharper and higher note. I had not noted this difference
when the female was in charge in 1925.
Now as to feeding : we get a hard-boiled egg, mash it up and add
more than double the quantity of crushed biscuit or very fine chicken

biscuit, Marie or Osborne biscuits do well. This is all mashed up with
a fork till quite crumbly and fine, one egg and biscuit lasts the seven
two days. Every morning I take some of this, a little of a good insectile
mixture, perhaps a little dried fly and ants 5 egg mixture, and if too dry
make crumbly with a very few drops of water. To this I add a little
Indian millet and maw seed just to encourage them as soon as possible
to eat seed, also if you have them a few live ants 5 eggs. This mixture
I give at 7.30 a.m., and again a fresh supply at about 6 p.m. (the old
stuff does well for some of the other insectivorous birds). At the same
time each morning they get a dish of very finely chopped grass and lettuce
leaves. This is very essential and lasts them all day. For live food they
get about a dozen or so small mealworms at 7.30, then again at 12 with
a few well-scoured gentles. In the evening about 5 I usually give
a few more gentles and live ants 5 eggs with the six o'clock egg food
and later on a few mealworms. They soon take to the gentles and do
well on them. These can be easily bred at this time of year: by hanging
up an old bird or hen in the garden over a box of sand you get a fine
supply of nice small clean gentles in a few days. Besides the above
you must have a saucer of chicken grit and sand, also clean water in a
shallow saucer.
When the young Quails get a little older they will desert the live
and egg food and turn their attention more and more to seed. Now you
should get some fine chicken seed mixture ; this contains small groats
and other seeds. The chicks will take readily to this and later on get
some ordinary groats, soon they will be chiefly on seed mixture such
as millet, canary, groats, etc., but it is well to have a little soft mixture
always with them as they like it for a change.
When I was at the Amsterdam Zoo I paid special attention to the
feeding of the birds and to my astonishment I one day saw a couple of
hen Californian Quails eating the mixed food for the insectivorous birds,
such as boiled rice, potato, a course insect mixture, also fruit, and when
I came home I noticed my other Californian Quails enjoying a good feed
of Lark food in the Waders 5 aviary. They seem to like it and are in the
best of plumage. Besides this they have canary, white and Indian
millet together with Dove mixture made of split maize, dari, wheat, and
a little hemp.

I think in conclusion that the Californian Quail is one of the best
for the beginner in this interesting family. The only drawback I have
found is that the hens seem a little bit delicate, but with a good, well-
planted aviary and plenty of grit and crushed cuttle-fish bone they should
be all right as egg binding seems to be the chief trouble.

Of the smaller foreign birds I have kept I find the African Fire Finch
becomes friendly very quickly and acquires that steadiness so admired
in our feathered charges in a short time. In fact, Fire Finches seem
to carry on in their own way without troubling seriously about anything.
It was my good fortune in 1922 to breed this species in a cage measuring
20 in. by 12 in. by 18 in., and from observations I feel convinced that
pair would have bred anywhere. The Fire Finches were caged with
Goldbreasts, Orange-cheeks, Grey Singing Finches, Blue-breasted
Waxbills, and Combassous, and all was going well until the former
turned their thoughts to setting up house. They commandeered
the seed-hopper, and Master Fire Finch became a most effective guardian
and would not allow any other bird near it. When their intentions
became evident they were transferred to separate quarters and soon
got to business. The cock built a beautiful nest in a box, and fashioned
a round entrance hole to it. The nest was composed of soft dried grass
and moss. This first nesting attempt occurred when the birds were
in the living room, for winter quarters, and the lighting up in the early
evening seemed to mislead them so that the nest was eventually deserted
when there were fully formed embryo in the eggs. After transfer to
summer quarters the nesting continued, and after one or two
unsuccessful attempts a brood was brought off. There were four
eggs which all hatched out, but one squab was thrown out of the nest,
and was again rejected after being replaced. The other three were
reared to maturity and proved to be all cocks.
On hatching out a variety of food was offered, including biscuit
and egg, dried flies, ants' cocoons, Indian and white millet, and canary
seed. The hen Fire Finch took a little of the egg-food on the first three

days, or seemed to be picking it over, but after that the young were fed
on seed only, and green food consisting of seeding grass and chickweed.
The rearing period passed off uneventfully, although it was an anxious
time for the human lookers-on.
It was very interesting to see these three tiny dark fluffy balls
bobbing their heads about, and then to watch them acquire their
feathers, and most interesting of all was the day when they left the
nest, such little birds, about half the size of their father, with tails
about half-an-inch long. The cock looked after the family and tended
them most assiduously. The young birds were three months old when
they started to change into the red coat of the male Fire Finch.
There was no special care or provision in the management of these
birds, the cage bottom was covered with sand, and a bath was available
always.
I would add the breeding took place in an indoor birdroom with
a west aspect. Incubation lasted 13-14 days, and the young left
the nest at 16 days. The temperature of the room varied between 55*
and 62* F. during the breeding period.

Sir, --In aviculture one must always be ready to learn and unlearn
and, I am tempted to add, to distrust profoundly the opinions of early
authorities and to refrain from endorsing any of their views which are
not amply supported by one's own personal experience ! The value
of fatty substances as a means of stopping certain cases of feather-
plucking among Parrots would appear to be established, but I think
we may find that the vice is produced by different causes and that
the same remedy would not always operate. I am also confident from
my own experience that the giving of oily seeds (as distinct from fat
in other forms) very rarely prevents feather-plucking and may help
to cause it. It would be interesting if Capt. Rattigan could tell us
whether among the many cases of feather-plucking he has been consulted
about in connection with his work for Cage Birds there have not been

PILEATED FINCHES AND SHAMAS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983343826086957" page_id="56211811"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
Sir, --There have been plenty of Pileated Finches on the market
lately, and I wonder whether any of our members have bred them.
A pair, which I bought last Spring, have nested twice. On each
occasion one young bird has lived to leave the nest, but none has
been fully reared. In common with other Buntings, these birds will
only feed their young ones on living insects. In the case of my birds,
nearly all the feeding was done by the hen, and she alone built the
nest. This latter was an elegant little structure, woven out of tow,
and suspended between twigs.
I find the Pileated Finches charming aviary birds, very tame, and
not spiteful with their companions. The hen is specially tame, and will
follow me about the aviary ; hoping, no doubt, for a mealworm.
By the by--do Buntings ever feed their young from the crop ?
The two species which have bred with me, Pileated Finches and
Nonpareils, certainly carried all food in the beak.
For the second season in succession my Shamas have reared young
ones.
Shamas are certainly the most delightful birds I have ever kept,
but what a tie when breeding !
If one intends to breed insectivorous birds one ought never to leave
home, unless one has, what I can never hope to possess, an intelligent
bird keeper.

BULLOCK'S HANGNEST
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997277857142857" page_id="56211822"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
In America the species belonging to the genus Icterus are known
as " Orioles ", but the adoption of this name in the Old World would
lead to confusion with the quite different group (Oriolidae) which are
primarily entitled to the designation. So over here we call them
Hangnests, from the peculiar pendulous type of nest which they
construct.
Bullock's Hangnest, scientifically known as Icterus bullocki, is an
inhabitant of Western North America, as far south as Mexico, taking
the place in the west of the better-known Baltimore Hangnest (I.
galbula) of Eastern and Central America, but that species may be readily
distinguished by the cock bird having the head entirely black and very
little white on the wings. The nesting habits of these birds is much
like that of the Weaver-birds, and the nests are wonderful structures ;
that of I. bullocki is said to be similar to that of I. galbula, which is
described by Taverner as one of the avian curiosities. " It is in the form
of a bag woven of fibres, plant down, hairs and string, and hangs
from the end of long, drooping branches. With her sharp, owl-like
bill the female thrusts a fibre into the side of the nest; then reaching
over to the inside pulls it through, tugging to make all tight and solid,
another fibre is thrust in and the process repeated until when complete
the nest is so knitted, woven, and fitted together that though tossed

at the end of long, flexible, whip-like branch tips through summer
and winter storms, it remains intact for several years."
The correct food of a bird in captivity may be judged from a know-
ledge of that taken in the wild state, and we learn that from analysis
of the stomach contents of 7. bullocki shot wild about 79 per cent
consists of animal matter and 21 of vegetable. Moths, pupae, caterpillars,
and beetles form a large proportion of the diet, while fruit is also
eaten.--D. S-S.
A TOUR IN FRANCE
By Capt. H. S. Stokes
(Concluded from p. 298.)
II. Mme. Lecallier's Collection at Elbeuf
The weather was quite dreadful, but this did not deter us from
setting out the next day to visit Mme. Lecallier. Professor Ghigi,
the eminent Italian authority on Pheasants and their keeping, had
arrived at Cleres and went with us.
Mme. Lecallier has recently moved into a new house, or rather
into a beautiful old house, a charming red-brick eighteenth century
chateau at the edge of the town. It stands in a small park completely
surrounded by walls, and is thus well suited for keeping birds at liberty.
Prom the dining-room windows, which faced both sides of the house,
we could see Black Buck and Wallabies, Sarus and Crowned Cranes,
and White Peacocks wandering about, and a tour of the garden after
lunch revealed a fine lot of seven Maras, or Patagonian Cavies.
These appear to be very difficult to get and not easy to keep every-
where when you have got them, but here they have bred well and are
very tame, coming close up to visitors for bread.
They are exceedingly quaint and attractive animals. There was
also a nice flock of five Screamers, too busy cropping the grass to
scream excessively. A pond overhung with trees contained Flamingoes
and some nice Ducks. We were driven in cars to see the aviaries,
which are in another property farther out of the town. A long wall
divided this property into two, and on each side of the wall and built
against it were ranges of aviaries.
</bodyText>

Gapt. H. S. Stokes--A Tour in France 283
Those on the left of the wall consisted of small flights and roofed
shelters mostly open at the front, and were largely devoted to
Budgerigars. Some, however, contained pairs of Cockatiels and
Ring-necked Doves, obviously used for hatching and rearing the
young of rarer species. I also noticed that several flights contained
a pair each of Doves, Parrakeets, and ground birds, and the results
seemed to be excellent.
On the other side of the wall was another row of aviaries : I should
be afraid to say how many, but probably thirty or more. These
were full of a host of birds. All the small Finches I have ever seen
seemed to be there, including Ruficanda Finches and Gouldian Finches
with young. There were Riippells Glossy Starlings, a rare and hand-
some species with a longish tail; the very rare Norfolk Island
Parrakeets, Barnard's Parrakeets with young, Yellow-bellied
Parrakeets, and a lovely pair of Blue-winged Grass-Parrakeets ; also
Stanley's and Mealy Rosellas.
The collection of Doves was enormous, for they have always been
favourites with Mme. Lecallier. Diamond Doves seemed to be there
in dozens, and there were several species of beautiful Ground Doves,
Geotrygon chrysia and G. montana, etc., also Bleeding Hearts. Against
this wall was also a bird-room filled with scores of cages of Bengalese
used for hatching rare Finches' eggs. I thought what a tedious job
it must be cleaning out Bengalese by the score !
Separated by a grass plot from all these aviaries were the
Pheasantries : literally dozens of them, with a feeding passage between
each row.
These were very thickly planted, more so than at Cleres, and the
Pheasants therefore correspondingly more difficult to see. However,
the English bird-keeper, Mr. Milligan, was kind enough to stir them up
for us and we were able to admire such rareties as Edwards', Elliott's
(quite lovely, and I badly wanted some and wished I felt richer),
Crestless Firebacks, Blue Crossoptilons, Common and Germain's
Polyplectrons, and a specimen of a rare Peacock Pheasant (Chaleurus
chalcurus), from Sumatra, purplish red with blue on the wings.
In a copse at the back of this property were some Barbary sheep
and a Soemmerring's gazelle, and there were also Demoiselle Cranes and

other birds in some paddocks. Altogether we must have seen some
thousands of birds, and felt much indebted to Mme. Lecallier for her
kindness in standing so long in drenching rain to show us her
collection.
M. Leleu's Marsh at Guesnin
Our next visit was to M. Leleu, a hundred miles to the north at
Guesnin. Here we were regaled with a sumptuous luncheon which
lasted two and a half hours. There were a few birds in enclosures in
the garden : four Crowned Cranes and some Canada and Bernacle
Geese. But the feature of this gentleman's hobby is a marsh, which
combines the dual functions of a Duck shoot and a Waterfowl collection.
There are some hundreds of acres of reedy marsh, with waterways and
larger open spaces of water, surrounded curiously enough by factories
and coal mines.
An old Warden of the marsh called Desire met us and took us first
to see his Rheas. Not, you would imagine, marsh birds, but there
they were in a field and looking remarkably well. Two pairs had
produced thirty-five young, and one of the old cocks was sitting
again.
Desire, a pipe ever in his mouth, made weird noises, and thirty-five
young Rheas ran to him for food. Desire hissed through his teeth,
and all the Rheas huddled into a bunch as in fear of some natural
enemy. Apropos of Rheas, and judging by the great quantity of
thriving young both here and at Cleres, it is evident that the right
way to raise them (I avoid the obvious pun) is to take them away
from the cock directly they are hatched and put them in a shed with
heat. They then seem to need no live insects and are easily fed on
soaked biscuit meal and chopped cabbage, and do not get dragged
about in long wet grass by the parent.
On an open pool fringed with willows we saw Flamingoes, and Black-
necked, Black, Whooper, and Coscoroba Swans, and Bar-headed and
Bernacle Geese. Bernacles struck me whenever I saw them as being
dainty, attractive, and good-shaped Geese, and they have the added
advantage in these hard times of being cheap.

quantities of Duck of all sorts--Carolinas, Chilean Teal and Bahamas
with young, Common Teal, Garganey, Wigeon, Shovellers, and hundreds
of Call Ducks. There were also Black Buck and Screamers in a drier
portion of the estate.
M. F. Vanoutryve's Birds at Boubaix
Staying the night at Lille we set out next morning to see the
collection of M. F. Yanoutryve at Roubaix. The towns of Lille,
Boubaix, and Turcoing are all contiguous and merge into one another ;
and the whole is a manufacturing district with many mines and factories
and their attendant smoke. It was, therefore, all the greater surprise
to find at M. Vanoutryve's house, in the middle of all this, a lovely
garden of 9 acres, with spacious lawns and clumps of shrubs and
good trees.
We saw a pretty pool on the lawn full of creatures : seven Egyptian
and five Chilian Flamingoes, all the choice Ducks, including Binged
and Cinnamon Teal, Blue Snow and Orinoco Geese. There were four
Demoiselle and four Crowned Cranes and North American Wild
Turkeys also all loose in the garden. Some cunningly hidden paddocks
contained Bheas, Stanley Cranes, and Black Buck, all of which we
were told are also released into the garden in winter. The feature
which struck me most, however, was a large quantity of small wading
birds all running loose on the lawns--Plover, Godwits, Buffs, Knots,
and others, looking very happy.
They are bought from the catchers on the marshes, turned out
with one clipped wing, and after the moult are allowed to fly away
again. Thus wild Nature is not deprived of her children and man is
also enabled to enjoy them for a time at close quarters.
M. Yanoutryve also has very fine aviaries and three bird-rooms.
There is one range of seven aviaries, beautiful and brand-new concrete
houses painted white inside, with flat ceilings having a large light of
frosted glass let in, and good outdoor flights. Two of these contained
quantities of small Finches, and one was devoted to Doves. A fourth
w T as given to Parrots and included Black-headed and Green-thighed
Caiques. Another had Allen's Porphyrios and a rare Bail from
Madagascar (Dryolimnus cuvieri), chestnut with a white throat,

Donaldson's Touracos, and Bamboo Partridges. A Spot-billed
Toucanette and another very rare Toucanette (Pteroglossus bitorquatus )
from Para, also inhabited this flight.
Yet another had a quantity of medium-sized soft-billed birds--
Mynahs, two sorts of Jay Thrushes, Silky Hangnests, San Bias Jays,
Glossy and Royal Starlings, a white Magpie and a white Blackbird.
I could only marvel that they did not all kill one another, but suppose
there were too many species for that.
Another range of aviaries had Budgerigars of good size and colour,
and pairs of Stanley Parrakeets and Roseate Cockatoos each in separate
compartments, also a good lot of Magpie Pigeons.
The bird-rooms were fit for a king to live in. One was almost
entirely devoted to Sunbirds spotlessly kept in good metal box-cages,
with very attractive white sand on the trays. We saw the lovely
Yellow-breasted (Pulchella) and Mariquensis among others. There
were also small Tanagers, the Superb, Desmarest's, the Black and Blue,
and a Magpie Tanager, and perfect Sugar-birds, the Yellow-winged,
the Black-headed, and the Purple. The Parrot room contained
Hyacinth, Spix, and other Macaws, a Black Palm Cockatoo, a Hawk-
headed Parrot, Yellow-backed Lories, Forsten's Lorikeets, and two
hen Derbyan Parrakeets. A third room had miscellaneous birds,
Hooded and Bengal Pittas and Hooded Siskins, so rare and difficult
to get nowadays.
M. Vanoutryve also specializes in racing Homer Pigeons, and we
were shown his large loft teeming with birds. Those flying loose were
summoned to their breakfast by an electric bell! One veteran flier
was said to have won his owner a hundred thousand francs.
After lunch, at which Monsieur Leleu was of the party, we were
motored to the River Somme through the coal-mining district of Lens,
so bitterly contested during the war. The mines are now entirely
worked by Polish labour, there not being enough Frenchmen for the
job. It made me sad to pass through all the country we fought over
and to see the names of brand-new villages whose former heaps of
rubble struck terror into the hearts of the stoutest fifteen years ago.
and where so many of one's friends lie cut off in the beauty of youth.

architecture and English gardens ablaze with lavender and roses and
violas, and tended by English gardeners.
On the Somme MM. Vanoutryve and Leleu own adjoining marshes.
The object of them is of course Duck-shooting, the industry of them
is eels. Eels appear to move about only during the last quarter of the
moon, when they are caught and sold alive at remunerative prices
and we were shown all the paraphernalia of eel-trapping. We went
down the river in punts, flushing on our way a Bittern, and saw some
Marsh Harriers hunting for their supper.
M. Vanoutryve combines, or is preparing to combine, Duck-shooting
with bird-keeping, and has fenced in a stretch of river and some acres
of bank with a mighty fence like the one we know at Foxwarren.
Here exotic Ducks, Geese, Swans, and Peafowl are to be established.
Opposite this reserve and far out in the river, quite out of sight of the
bank, is a shooting hut to which we were rowed. Here was every
imaginable modern comfort for a stay of some days, including even
electric light brought across from the shore by submarine cable, and
we enjoyed a most excellent dinner cooked on the premises. After-
wards we were rowed back to our waiting car and left for Amiens,
which we reached at 11 o'clock.
On our way we passed Villers Brettonaux, where M. Delacour
pointed out the last remnants of his former home, destroyed in 1918
with all his collection of birds. I never thought before of birds and
battles being associated together.
I had paid hurried visits to Amiens during the war, chiefly in search
of eatable food and a bath, and had vague memories of a cathedral
girt about with sandbags, and was now staggered by the beauty of
this great church : such vastness, such delicate tracery of carved stone,
such lovely wrought ironwork, and such glorious Louis XV chapels.
Let all who can go there and see it and stay the night in one of the
very excellent hotels in the town.
The Jardin des Plantes at Paris
We went also to Paris for a day, and did first the shops on the
Quais. There are numerous bird shops and fish shops (live fish for
aquariums, not dead ones for eating), and though there was nothing
of special note in these shops at the moment I was greatly struck by

their cleanliness and pleasant smell. The aquariums and their
fittings were excellent and so were the bird cages : good practical
shapes and sizes of cages, most of them open, and some entirely of
wood, including the bars. Very easy to scrub, and most attractive
for a sitting-room.
M. Delacour had business at the Museum (which in France means
the Natural History Museum, other museums being called Musees),
and while there we were shown round by Professor E. Bourdelle,
in charge of mammals and birds both in skins at the Museum and alive
in the Zoo. We saw also the late Due d'Orlean's collection of stuffed
specimens, which is enormous in extent and housed in a specially
erected building. There is a room devoted to Arctic life, and two
more rooms are given to African birds and mammals, naturally
arranged in a typical landscape with painted mural canvas. Outside
Africa and the real thing I should not think anything better could be
found, and the collection--all mounted by Rowland Ward, of London,--
is well worth a special visit. Professor Bourdelle then took us over
the road to the Jardin d'acclimatation, which is the State-owned
Zoo, and he very kindly showed us everything there was to see in
detail.
Owing to post-war stringency the houses are perhaps a little out
of date and cramped, but there are very good grass paddocks for
antelopes and large birds.
The oryx antelopes were particularly good, and had been bred
there.
Outstanding among birds was a female Wattled Crane, and
Pheasants and small birds were fairly well represented.
Funds are being collected for a large Carnivora house and for
a Monkey house.
We saw a gorilla which has been there four years awaiting its new
house in a small cage, and numerous lemurs in excellent condition.
There was also an excellent vivarium, newly erected and well lighted
and heated, and the reptiles looked brisk and well.
Thus ended a very enjoyable and most instructive trip which I am
glad to have had the opportunity of taking, finding everywhere, as
most aviculturists will, something fresh to be added to one's scanty
store of knowledge.

By Alfred Ezra, O.B.E.
There are three species of Bambusicola : the Common or Chinese
(B. thoracica), which has often been imported and is now quite
acclimatized in Japan ; Fytch's Bamboo Partridge from the hills of
Burmah, Yunnan, and Tonkin ; and the Formosan species, the subject
of this article. At the present time all three are represented in my
collection, and also in those of Madame Lecallier and M. Delacour,
in France. The Common species has often been bred ; Fytch's has
not yet been bred. In 1927 several pairs of Formosan Bamboo
Partridges were sent from Japan by M. Delacour : some went to
Madame Lecallier and I secured two pairs. In 1929 they laid eggs
all over the place in one of my largest aviaries without making a nest.
This year I let the grass grow very long in order to give them the
necessary cover. It apparently was successful, and I was delighted to
see early in June three tiny chicks running about with their parents
and feeding well and hiding in the grass when disturbed. The parents
were not wild, and the young were easily reared without the help
of any special food, although a few fresh ants' eggs were very much
appreciated. In August they were three-quarters grown and resembled
the parents in every way. This species was reared in France in 1929
and again this year by Madame Lecallier, but with the help of broody
hens, and it was also bred in Japan several years ago in the same way.
I think this is the first time this species has been reared in England.

did not; there were in consequence only three young and one addled
egg, but as the birds have bred in a cage and St. Helena Waxbills
may be described as " common " birds--though nothing could be less
" common " than their elegant shape and their quiet beauty--I thought
I was in duty bound, after the appeal of the New Zealanders, to sit
down and write. I think St. Helena Waxbills must be some of the
most charming of the small birds ; they are not so small that they are
timid like their cousins, the Orange-cheeked and Red-eared ; they are
easily tamed and both intelligent and beautiful. What more could
one desire for a few rupees ?
I bought my birds in Crawford Market in Bombay last July for
a few rupees ; they had no feathers on their heads and few feathers
in their tails, but my friend the bird dealer, Hussain the son of Amumia,
assured me that they were two pairs and he was right. But some time
after a door of the cage was carelessly left open and then there was
only one pair. I did not even get angry. What was the good ?
The little boy who looked after them was quite sure the door opened
of itself. And I was really not so very sorry because when the two
pairs were put in the same cage and in course of time grew all their
feathers and came into really beautiful plumage, the cocks fought
each other and chased the hens so that there was always a rough
house.
I have little time to look after such pretty things as St. Helena
Waxbills. Murderers, dacoits, and lawyers take up most of my time,
but as I had no idea if St. Helena Waxbills would nest in a box hung
on to the end of their cage, I tried. Believing that the average nesting
box is too small and that is why, for instance, Bengalese rear only
one young when they should rear five, I had two nest-boxes made
measuring 9 inches long by 7 inches wide by 7 inches high, with half
the front closed in. These I hung, one on each end, of the French
triple breeding cage, to which I referred many months ago (how many,
alas ! I dare not remember) in an article on Avadavats. I have had
a small removable door made in each end of the cage so that the nest-
box can be hung up against the opening and the birds have their
exits and their entrances. This was in January, our Indian winter,
like, or something like, our English Spring. I lined these nest-boxes,

Godfrey Davis--Breeding St. Helena Waxbills in India 291
as I always do, with coarse grass roughly shaped as the foundation
of a nest. After all, when birds build in bushes the supporting leaves
and branches are already there. One hen got busy at once. She
went into the corner of the nest-box and the cock, her husband, in
the interval of fighting the other cock, the other lady's husband,
brought her lengths of a dry grass-like fibre that grows about here,
and she put this in position and turned round and round and shaped
it with her breast till she had the cup of the nest well and truly formed.
Then she started on the roof and soon the nest was domed ; then the
cock really started in to help and together they built a long, narrow,
tubular entrance, much like the entrance to the nest of a Weaver bird
but smaller and projecting outwards from the front of the nest, not
falling downwards. The second pair could not get on with their
nest at all. The other cock saw to that.
After a few days the cock seemed to be always inside the nest.
I thought it should have been the hen inside the nest, but there is no
chance of confusing a cock St. Helena with a hen when you know the
difference. The breast of the cock is suffused with pink from the throat
downwards, and the feathers at the root of the tail are distinctly
reddish ; the hen is pink only on the lower part of the breast; her
colour is darker than that of the cock and there are no reddish feathers
at the root of the tail. Well, I thought I had better catch up the
second pair to give the first one a chance, and this I did, though as
always I was short of cages, but I could have saved myself the trouble.
Not only did the second pair soon escape by the door, which opened
of itself, but the catching up of the second pair disturbed the first
and both cock and hen deserted. I opened the nest and found four
white eggs, oval in shape. When I opened them there was no sign
of incubation, so I like to think that they were infertile and under
any circumstances would not have hatched. But I had got as far as
nest and eggs. The next thing was a nest and eggs and young.
With the removal of their rivals the first pair showed no inclination
to go to nest again. They sat together in the sun ; they preened each
other's feathers and looked into each other's eyes and made no attempt
to conceal their mutual love and admiration. It was all very charming,
but it was a great waste of time.

As the hot weather drew to an end they fell into a moult, and I
removed the nest-box. The hot weather is not a time to bring up
a family, though my Zebra Finches and Bengalese are of a different
opinion, but on the question of large families the ideas of Zebra Finches
and Bengalese are out of date. When, however, the rains came and
the parched earth drank in eagerly the precious fluid and in a few
brief weeks the dry and sandy fields became a verdant green and the
birds called joyously from the hedgerows as I rode by, I hung the
nest-box again on the end of the Waxbills' cage and gave them flowering
grass to eat and tiny maggots, which an old Shikari prepared from
fishes' heads in his mud village near the river, and soaked and sprouting
Kong or Indian millet, which I had found they would always eat in
preference to the dry seed, and I gave them dried grass and feathers to
build their nest. And between the bursts of rain the cage was put out
in the sun as it shone through the passing clouds, and the cock began
to dance. He took a feather in his beak and bent back his head,
pushed out his chest, and up and down upon the perch he danced,
uttering at the same time a shrill sibilant call. How ridiculous is
the male of the species when he is in love ! But love is blind. The
little hen came and watched this extraordinary performance and was
obviously lost in wonder and delight. " This," she thought, " is
the most wonderful husband that has ever been," but still she did not
lose touch with practical affairs. She took up a piece of grass in her
beak and flew to the nest. But this time the cock did most of the
building. The grass in the nest-box was already shaped and this he
lined with dried grass and then he quickly built the dome ; then he
lined it all with feathers and built the entrance. The hen flew about
the cage, picked up eagerly the dried crushed egg-shell scattered on
the sand trays, and then she took a piece of grass in her beak and
she too began to dance. It was in this way she called the cock and it
was only after the hen so displayed that she would receive the cock.
When he danced alone and she did not dance she fled from his advances.
I found that a few feathers dropped in the cage provoked this dancing.
Each would seize a feather in its beak and dance one to the other.
The cock also would stand stiff and upright on his perch and give
utterance to a shrill triple call. It could scarcely be called a song,

and then with open wings he would chase the hen and she would fly
from his eager wooing. The etiquette was that both must dance.
On 19th July I saw one egg in the nest. The entrance was not
so narrow nor the nest so far back in the box as on the first occasion,
and I could see in. Four eggs were laid and I had the cage then put
in a small unused room. I had found that the birds would eat readily
the yoke of hard-boiled egg. Why, I do not know. Perhaps it was
the bright, cheerful colour. I should add that the little maggots
were first cleansed in sand for twenty-four hours and then washed,
so that they were white and clean and these the birds had always eaten
with avidity. Here, then, was food for the young.
For the first few days the cock seemed to sit much more than
the hen. I found this also in the case of Avadavats, but towards
the end the hen sat more than the cock and was hardly ever out of
the nest. The last egg was laid on the 22nd, and I expected the eggs
to hatch on 4th August, but the birds had now lengthened the entrance
to the nest and I could see nothing. But on 4th August chopped
yolk of hard-boiled egg was put in the cage and was twice renewed
during the day. Seeding grass was put in and tiny maggots but the
maggots were left alone. The proper diet in the opinion of the birds
was hard-boiled yoke of egg and seeding grass. I have no doubt they
knew best and this contained all the vitamins. But after the first
four or five days they took less and less of the yolk of egg and the
little maggots became less and less. Obviously mother and father
were changing the food. It was now seeding grass and tiny maggots
for the babies.
About ten days after hatching I thought it was time to see how
many young there were and how they were getting on. The parent
birds were very tame, and I took off the nest-box and looked in. The
previous night I had seen both the cock and the hen sleeping on the
perch outside the nest, and I was a little anxious. I looked into the
nest with an electric torch and saw three young ; the quill feathers
on the wings were showing, but little else. I thought they were some-
what slow in growing but I had more important things to think about.
I had done my best for the little strangers and so had the cock and
hen. I think, however, their growth must have been fairly normal,

for from time to time I looked and saw the feathers break through
and grow ; the eyes wide open ; the beak become black and, on 26th
August, some twenty-two days from hatching, the first young left
the nest. It was fully feathered ; the tail was about 1J inches long ;
the red line over the eye was well marked and the breast, though
lighter in colour than the parent birds, is suffused with a pale pink ;
the feathers at the root of the tail are reddish and the beak is shiny
black with a white spot at each corner. This, I think, is the young
son and the other two are little hens, because they show much less
pink upon the breast though the feathers at the root of the tail are
reddish. At the corner of their beaks also is a spot of white. This was
much more noticeable when they were younger and in the nest, and
perhaps it shows mother and father where to put the food ! The
feathers are barred as in the adult birds. The plumage is inclined
to be soft and fluffy, and there is no sign of down. Yesterday and
to-day, the 28th, they were put out in the morning and evening sun.
The parents feed them, careless of lookers-on, and it is a pretty sight
to see the young, so quiet and well behaved, waiting each its turn ;
so different from the pushing clamorous young Zebra Finches.
Already the parents seem to contemplate a second family for the
cock has started to dance before the hen and push out his chest and
posture. I hope he will not neglect his first family for the second.
Men are deceivers ever.

The nest is usually built in a tree, though occasionally upon the
ground, and the eggs are white. In captivity the food consists of
grain, green food, fruit, and meal containing a small proportion of
meat. Clean sharp grit is necessary to aid their digestion.
These birds appear to be naturally tame, and the larger species
become especially so and will follow their owners about like dogs.
It is necessary to guard them against frost, as their feet are especially
susceptible to frost-bite. Comparatively few instances of their breeding
in captivity have been recorded.
Genus Crax .-- The True Curassows
The Crested Curassow (Crax alector) inhabits the northern parts
of South America. The general colour of both sexes is black glossed
with purple, the belly, flanks, and under tail-coverts being white.
The crest is uniform black in the male but slightly barred with white
in the female. There are no white tips to the tail-feathers. The cere
and base of the bill are yellow, but there is no knob at the base of the
upper mandible nor are wattles present. Total length of male 34 inches
the female being slightly less.
Sclater's Curassow ( Crax fasciolata ) inhabits the forests of
Eastern South America.
The male resembles the male of C. alector, but the plumage has
a green instead of a purple gloss and the tail-feathers are tipped
with white.
The female differs from the male in being barred with narrow
white cross-bars over the whole of the upper plumage. The chest
and sides of the breast are buff, barred with black, the thighs and
abdomen pale rufous-buff.
The male is 30J inches in total length, the female being slightly
smaller. Has been bred in the New York Zoological Park.
The Pinima Curassow ( C . jpinima) is only known from female
specimens which suggests that these are aberrent examples of C.
fasciolata. It differs from the normal female of that species in the
tail being uniform black, the thighs and breast black, barred with
buff.
The Globose Curassow (C. globicera ) inhabits Central America,

and has been frequently imported. The male is black glossed with
dark green above, the abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts being
white. At the base of the upper mandible is a conspicuous yellow knob.
The female differs entirely from the male. Crest barred with white,
the head, neck, and throat barred with black and white ; chest and
mantle black washed with rufous ; lower back deep chestnut-brown,
wing-coverts and quill chestnut mottled with black ; breast chestnut,
rest of under parts cinnamon.
The Globose Curassow has been bred in France, England, and the
United States, and a young bird was reared between a male of this
species and a female of the so-called Heck's Curassow, as recorded
in the Avicultural Magazine for November, 1908. From the account
then published we append the following summary :--

his part in domestic affairs appears to be restricted to the expulsion
of intruders.

flight feathers which grow very rapidly.
" 7. The chicks leave the nest and follow the mother to the
ground the first day after hatching.
" 8. She broods them on the ground for a few nights and at
intervals during the day. After this they spend the nights perched
by her side on a branch well above the ground, reaching their
position by climbing.
" 9. They feed at first upon insect food, and afterwards take
to the diet of their parents.
" 10. For several weeks they do not peck food from the ground
but take it from their mother's beak. At ten weeks old they feed
themselves and are also fed by her."

has never been discovered. It is very heavily barred with white and
buff. The young bird reared in the London Zoological Gardens by
a female of this form, mated to a male of C. glohicera as recorded above,
grew up to be a typical example of C. glohicera, which would seem to
prove that C. hecki is an abnormal form of that species.
The Panama Curassow ( C. panamensis) of Southern Nicaragua
and Costa Rica is much like C. glohicera, from which it differs in the
tail-feathers of the male being margined with white and those of the
female strongly barred with white or pale buff.
Yarrell's Curassow (C. carunculata ) inhabits South-Eastern
Brazil. The male resembles that of C. glohicera, but the knob at the
base of the upper mandible and the wattles at the base of the lower
mandible are scarlet instead of yellow.
The female differs from the male in having the feathers of the
crest barred with white, and the abdomen, flanks, and under tail-
coverts are rufous. The basal half of the bill is scarlet but there
is no knob.
The male is about 32 inches in length, the female somewhat smaller.
The Globulose Curassow (C. globulosa) of the Upper Amazon
differs from C. carunculata only in the male having the knob over his
bill and his wattles yellow instead of scarlet. In the female the base
of the bill differs from that of C. carunculata in the same way.
Daubenton's Curassow (C. daubentoni), which inhabits Venezuela,
may be distinguished from the Globose Curassow by the presence
of white tips to the tail-feathers and a pale yellow wattle on each side
of the base of the lower mandible in the male. The female differs from
the male in having the feathers of her crest white near the base and
by the breast and sides being barred with white. The abdomen is
white and the tail-feathers tipped with white.
Prince Albert's Curassow (C. alberti), from the United States
ot Colombia, is a handsome species. The male resembles that of
C. daubentoni, but the knob at the base of the bill and the wattles are
blue, and the lores are thickly feathered.
The female somewhat resembles that of Sclater's Curassow, from
which it differs in having the crest-feathers nearly black with two
narrow white bars, and the under parts being of a deeper chestnut.

<bodyText confidence="0.951661617647059" page_id="56211841"  page_num="298" year="" vol="">
This genus, containing one species only, is distinguished by the
possession of a full crest of long recumbent feathers covering the
top of the head and by the lores and large space around the eyes
being naked.
The Flat-crested or Nocturnal Curassow (N. urumutum)
occurs in British Guiana, Rio Negro, and the Upper Amazons. It is said
to live during the day-time hidden away in hollow trees or dense
thickets, and to emerge at dusk in search of food.
In the male the crest is black, the head, neck, and chest chestnut,
becoming of a browner chestnut on the upper parts, all being finely
mottled with black. The under parts are cinnamon mottled with
a darker shade on the sides. The tail black, tipped with whitish-buff.
Round the eye a naked space which is yellow above and purplish
below. The bill is scarlet.
The female differs in being more coarsely mottled with pale rufous-
buff on a darker ground. The male is about 24 inches in total length,
the female somewhat smaller. This species is uncommon in captivity.
Genus Mitua .-- The Razor-billed Curassows
In this genus the upper mandible is much elevated, the crest not
curled, and the sexes similar in plumage.
The Razor-billed Curassow (M . mitu) is a well-known and
frequently imported species, of glossy blue-black hue, the abdomen
chestnut and the tail tijpjped with white. The bill is orange-red, the upper
mandible rising to a narrow upper edge. Razor-billed Curassows
are almost always tame and will follow their owners like domestic
animals. Nevertheless, they do not seem inclined to breed in captivity,
though on several occasions eggs have been laid, two to a clutch, white
and remarkable for the intensely rough texture of the shell.
The nest is said to be built in a tree at a considerable height from
the ground and to be composed of sticks. The male is about 34 inches
in length, the female being somewhat smaller. The Razor-billed
Curassow inhabits Guiana, Amazonia, Bolivia, and Peru.
The Lesser Razor-billed Curassow (M. tomentoza) inhabits
British Guiana, extending southwards along the Rio Branco and Rio

<bodyText confidence="0.980636952380952" page_id="56211842"  page_num="299" year="" vol="">
The Galeated Curassow ( P. pauxi), the only species in the
genus, is perhaps the finest of the Curassows. Its habitat is Venezuela,
Colombia, Guiana, and Peru.
The plumage of the male is black, glossed with green, the under
tail-coverts and tips of the tail-feathers being white. At the base
of the upper mandible is a large, egg-shaped casque, slate-blue in
colour, the bill and legs being red.
The female differs in being browner, the back and wing-coverts
chestnut barred with black and buff. Some females are said to resemble
the male in plumage.
The Guans
The species of Guans that have been imported alive are contained
in the genera Penelope, Ortalis, Pipile, and Aburria. They are of
smaller size than the Curassows, the top of the head is completely
covered with feathers though there is a bare space round the eyes,
and the throat is generally naked and in some cases carries a median
wattle. Like the Curassows the Guans are generally tame, though
instances of their breeding or even laying eggs in captivity are very
rare. In the wild state the nest is said to be a somewhat bulky
structure composed of sticks and situated in a tree. Their food consists
of fruit and berries, grain, insects, and green vegetation.

There are nearly twenty species of this genus known, of which some
half-dozen have been imported. They are smaller than the Penelopes
and are further distinguished by the absence of a median wattle on
the throat, this being replaced by a band of feathers down the middle
of the naked throat. The sexes are alike, and as in the case of Penelope
these are forest birds which build their nests in the trees.
Of the six species we shall mention the first four are distinguished
by the outer flight-feathers being brown, the extremities of the outer
tail-feathers chestnut, and the chest of uniform colour.

Disappointments and failures in aviculture are sometimes as
interesting as successes, though naturally not so satisfactory to the
owner of the birds in question. The following notes on two breeding
disappointments here during the past summer may be worth while
recording. In both cases I had seen visions of winning a medal, as
neither species had been bred in captivity before. No. 1 concerns a
very fine pair of Sclater's Crowned Pigeons (Goura sclateri), the finest
and rarest example of this magnificent genus of Ground Pigeon.
They had wintered well, and in April the loud, guttural booming of
the male and his constant display gave hopes of their shortly going to
nest. They had an aviary entirely to themselves, except for a few
small Finches. The single egg, however, was not laid until 11th June,
and the female at once began to sit; the egg is curiously elongated,
and rather small for the size of the bird, not at all like an average
Pigeon's egg. All went well for four days, and then the hen somehow
managed to break the egg ! Nothing more happened till 1st July,
when another egg was laid, and our hopes again were raised of seeing
a young " Sclater's However, after sitting assiduously for over
a fortnight, this egg appeared to be clear and the bird left it. A third
egg was laid on 1st August, and again was found to be clear. However,
the indefatigable birds again laid, their fourth attempt, a few weeks

later ; but the result was once more the same, and we had to resign
ourselves to the disappointment of, presumably, four clear eggs in one
summer. The birds had been seen to pair on more than one occasion,
so it was all the more disappointing that all the eggs laid should have
been infertile.
The second case concerns a pair of rare Starlings. They are
either Riippell's Starling (Lamprotornis porphyropterus) or else the
very closely allied, but much rarer, species, L. purpureus. Their
former owner considers them to be the latter species, but as purpureus
is described as having the iris brown, and in porphyropterus pale yellow
or white, and in my pair it certainly is yellowish, I incline to think
they are the latter; however, whichever species they are, they made
a nest of hay, feathers, and grass in a box, and three eggs were laid.
The hen sat well, the cock flying savagely at anyone who entered the
aviary, and about 14th July three young birds were hatched. How-
ever, four days later they appeared to lose all interest in their offspring,
ceased to feed or brood them, and entirely deserted them, and although
we tried to rear them by hand, they quickly died off one by one. Early
in September they laid again, once more three eggs ; only to desert
them after the hen had sat well for a week. All the eggs were fertile.
This was all specially disappointing, and I am afraid they are bad
parents in every sense of the word. But perhaps if it was not for
these disappointments aviculture would lose half its interest.
The following incident is, I think, worth recording, showing the
extraordinary intelligence of birds. One day last week a kitten was
playing about on the floor of the house where the birds' food, etc.,
is prepared. The door was wide open, and naturally the pair of
Trumpeters must come in to see what was going on : more inquisitive
birds never existed. They gazed in astonishment at the kitten,
trumpeting loudly and flapping their wings with excitement, then
dashed off with a run (and how quickly Trumpeters can run if they
like) ; a few minutes later they returned, bringing with them two
Guans and two Curassows, who all live loose in the adjoining yard,
all six birds coming hurriedly up at a run to the open door, where they
stood staring, with obvious excitement and much clucking, at the
unoffending kitten. The Trumpeters as a rule are afraid of the

There were three Royal Starlings in my very small aviary at Under-
wood, Branksome Park, Bournemouth West. I was not sure of their
sex, as when they are not in full plumage it is difficult to tell them,
and the keeper at the Zoological Gardens was not able to help me.
However, two of them paired up and were most unfriendly to the
remaining one, which has since died. Noticing they had paired up
and were trying to build in a wooden box with a hole in it that hung
from the side of a small wooden house about 6 feet from the ground,
I put sacking round, making a square of about 4 feet so that they could
go in and out by a small aperture and the other birds---which were
chiefly small ones--did not seem to wish to go in. They laid three
eggs, two of which were fertile, and after the usual time two fine young
birds were born. The trouble was finding enough food for them,
and if it were not for the quantities of ants' nests about and the constant
searching for them of my aviary man and gardener we should never
have reared the birds. The amount of ants' eggs they consumed was
marvellous. The two young birds are now flying in the aviary with
their parents and other birds, and are coming into colour. I now can
distinguish the cock parent bird as he has a longer tail and his plumage
is somewhat brighter than the hen's. The parents also built another
nest since, but although they laid eggs they did not rear any young.
My Black-winged Grackles, rather fussy and restless birds, build
their nest also in an ordinary box with a small hole for entrance on
a wall about 6 feet from the ground in my aviary. They needed no

still are doing so. They raised two fine young birds, and also took
the most extraordinary amount of ants' eggs to keep them going.
They built a second nest and sat, but with no result and, as they show
a tendency to build a third nest now, I am penning them apart, as I
think it is too late to start again and too much strain on the hen to
sit again.

BUNTING

By B. Jackson
In the early spring of this year I received a pair of Emheriza
flaviventris and put them into a small outdoor aviary, open at the front
only. I nailed a small fir tree up in one corner and after a short time,
as the weather became warmer, I supplied them with grass, bents,
feathers, and short horse-hair, and they started to build.
I wrote to our Editor and he knew of no previous occasion upon
which these birds had ever been bred in captivity, and I also looked
through quite a lot of back numbers of the Avicu^ltukal Magazine
and Bird Notes and could only find one instance where they had ever
laid and that was in 1911 by a pair of birds owned by Mr. Shore-Baily,
when all the eggs were unfertile in the two attempts made by his pair.
I thought, here is a chance to make history in the realm of aviculture,
and also win our medal, the blue ribbon of all keen aviculturists.
The hen apparently did most of the building, and in four days from
starting the nest was complete, the inside being lined with horse-hair.
On the following day, 31st May, the first egg was laid, and after laying
a further two eggs on the two following days the hen commenced to
sit very keenly. The cock bird spent most of his time sitting on a ledge
over the nest, but as far as I could see neither fed the hen or took his
turn at sitting upon the eggs.
On the morning of 12th June I saw an eggshell under the nest,
so gave them an abundant supply of live ant eggs (of which, fortunately,
I could obtain a plentiful supply very near to my aviaries), meal-
worms, and well-scoured gentles. Normally I gave these birds millet

and Canary seed and a few mealworms. I noted that when live food
was obtainable the birds immediately left off eating seed. By noon
another eggshell was thrown out and in the evening I saw the hen busy
feeding the young. On the following day I looked into the nest and
saw that all three eggs had hatched. The young were covered with
a dark coloured down. On the 15th I found one of the young on the
floor, but as it showed signs of life I warmed it and placed it back in
the nest and hoped for the best. On the 19th the young were alive
and in pen feather, and I noticed that the cock bird was now assisting
in feeding. The hen seemed very happy with her family and sang
incessantly with her beak full of mealworms. On the 22nd I found
one of the young on the floor, warmed it, and returned it to the nest.
On the 23rd the young looked very much like the hen and showed
dull white wing bars and seemed fully fledged. The nest was very
full with the three young and I think this must be the normal clutch.
On the 25th I saw the hen flying about with building material in her
beak, and to my dismay found all three young dead in the nest. Thus
ended round No. 1.
I then took the Buntings out of this aviary and put them into a
much larger one along with some Budgerigars. I took the fir-tree
and nailed it high up as before, but the birds did not seem to settle,
so removed them back to their old quarters, where they immediately
started to build again. The first egg was laid on the 5th July. Three
eggs were again laid and three young hatched. By a slight alteration
to the aviary I gave them a flight up a passage, and made them fetch
their food from the far end. On the ninth day the young were nearly
fledged and I noted that round the edge of the mouth was a yellow
colour. The parents still brooded the young at nights, and I thought
all was going well, but alas ! on the twelfth day one of the young lay
dead on the floor. The following day another died, and so I removed
the cock bird out of sight and hearing of the hen, and after watching
her for a while was glad to see she went to the nest and fed the remaining
youngster. On the fourteenth and fifteenth days all went well, but
on the sixteenth I went away in the morning and returned at 4 p.m.
to find the young one on the floor almost dead and the hen bird also
in a bad way, and it looked to me like a case of egg-binding. I managed

to feed the young on mealworms, but it seemed very weak. I took
both birds home and applied the usual remedies for egg-binding,
and the following morning she laid and recovered. The young one
I put into the cage w T ith the hen, who tried to feed it, but the young
one was too weak and died.
So ended round No. 2.
I still have the old birds and I am sincerely hoping that round
No. 3 in 1931 will be successful.
MR. WILFRED FROST'S IMPORTATION
Mr. Frost returned recently from an extensive collecting trip to
the East, and brought a large number of rare birds. There were several
Birds of Paradise--Wilson's, Magnificent, Lesser, and Six-plumed--
but of perhaps of even more interest were species never before seen alive
over here. Space will only allow me to give their names : Javan Fork-
tail (Henicurusleschenaulti), Chestnut-headed Ground Thrush ( Geocichla
interpres), Oort's Barbet ( Cyanops oorti), Papuan Frogmouth ( Podargus
papuensis), Aru Boobook Owl ( Spiloglaux aruensis), Aru Noble Pheasant

Sir, --Having taken the important post of Curator to Mr. G. H.
Gurney, it is with great interest that I have been watching the wild
birds that are to be found in this locality. On 8th June I located
a pair of Tree-creepers running up and down an old elm-tree, and on
closer inspection I found their nest which contained four young. What
a lot of insect life they must devour when feeding young with small
grubs ; they feed their offspring no less than eight times in ten minutes.
It was a pleasing thing to know that they all left their nest a week later

without being disturbed. A pair of Spotted Flycatchers built a nest
in the ivy clinging to the wall: four young were hatched and these
I rung with small metal rings. I shall eagerly watch to see if they
return to their old haunts next year. In the garden near the Duck
pond a pair of Nuthatches could be seen searching the trees for food,
but search as I would I could not find their nest, which no doubt they
built in the wood close by. A pair of Blackcaps nested and reared
their young in a small copse. What lovely minstrels these birds are.
On the side of the road in a tall tree a pair of Goldfinches have still
young which they are feeding this 20th September. I saw a flock
of Crossbills working on the pine-trees : there was no mistaking them,
as I plainly saw several with their scarlet breasts. Mr. Gurney has
thoughtfully placed several nest-boxes on the trees, and these were
mostly made use of by the Tits, of which I have only seen three species--
Coal, Blue, and Greater. A wild Heron swooped down in the park,
no doubt attracted by the feeding there of the Cranes. I did not see
this bird myself, but Mr. Gurney kindly gave me full particulars.
Since leaving the county of Northants I have missed such familiar
friends as the Redstart, Nightingale, and Red-backed Shrike, none
of which have I seen in this district. Most of the summer migrants
have now taken their departure : only the Swallows seem to be left.
I shall eagerly watch now for the coming of the winter migrants, and
of these I will write later. Trusting these few rough notes will be of
some interest.

a question of sex, the male having the narrower band. I have, there-
fore, two distinct pairs. The crests in my birds are not so noticeably

A MURDER CASE
Sir,--A pair of Spreo Starlings has a brood of almost fledged young
ones in a log in one of my aviaries. For months they have lived
tranquilly with a few other small birds in the same aviary, to which
the Starlings did not pay the slightest attention. One morning this
week the cock Starling appeared to go mad, and in a kind of frenzy
killed one after the other, a cock Cherry Finch, one of a breeding pair ;
a Finch Lark, which he dragged into the nesting log ; and a perfectly
inoffensive Plumed Ground Dove, which was a good deal bigger than
the Starling himself, and which seldom left the floor of the aviary ;
this he completely stripped of feathers, and pecked the head bare.
This series of murders is only one more proof that a pair of breeding
birds are not safe, except in an aviary entirely by themselves. I am
not sure that the young Spreos, which should be out of the nesting-log
any day now, are worth the amount of birds killed by their jealous
and savage parent.

in my collection about eighteen years and before that was kept in a

SUNSHINE ON NEST-BOXES: MOVABLE AVIARIES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999478185185185" page_id="56211856"  page_num="311" year="" vol="">
Sir, --It is well known that much hot sunshine is injurious to adult
Parrakeets, but the experience I have had this year goes to show that
a very hot sun-baked site for the nest is equally detrimental to unfledged
young which do not come in direct contact with the sun's rays.
I was not able this season personally to superintend the placing
of the breeding logs and boxes and the aviary attendant, hoping
probably to secure greater privacy for the birds while men were at
work re-erecting aviaries, arranged them against the front of the
aviary exposed to the blazing sun we got during the dry spell in early
summer.
To my dismay nearly all the young birds, whether Ring-necks,
Crimson-wings, or Broadtails, showed, on leaving the nest, a more or
less pronounced tendency to rickets--a complaint I thought I had
learned to prevent by avoiding breeding in the aviary shelters. Even
birds whose parents were feeding liberally on cod-liver oil soaked seed
and had always in previous seasons produced perfect young were
not right although they made rapid progress towards complete recovery
after fledging--a sure sign that it was the nest and not the constitution
of the parents that was at fault.
The latest first brood belonged to a pair of Rosellas whose young
last year, reared in the aviary shelter, were the worst cases of rickets
I have ever seen. This year the hen whose nest was in the flight
against the front of the shelter in the same situation as the other
unsatisfactory ones, did not hatch until the weather had broken and
there was much cloud and rain, and to my surprise the young bird
was as strong as one could wish. Even more striking proof that too
much sun was at the root of the mischief was afforded by a pair of

Yellow-rumps. These in previous seasons had always reared beautiful
young, but this year two of the first brood were rickety. The hen
laid a second clutch before the first lot of young had flown, giving
me no opportunity either to clean or move the nest, but we shaded it
with branches laid on the roof of the flight and all four young of the
second brood are as strong as those of other seasons, although, save for
the shading and damper weather, no single factor has been altered.
As most members are aware I am a strong advocate of movable
aviaries and of liming and salting vacated sites that have to be re-
occupied later on. This plan has been criticized on the ground that
movable aviaries are less easy to make artistic and require more level
ground than most people have at their command.
Messrs. Boosey and Brooksbank, whose primary concern is the
health and fertility of their birds but who hitherto have been rather
short of ground and particularly of flat ground, have made some
interesting discoveries with regard to movable aviaries and the treat-
ment of sites. The results gained by heavy annual dressings of lime
and salt are good, even in excess of our expectations. Birds belonging
to species highly susceptible to the bad effects of stale ground retain
their health and fertility perfectly for a few years, and as far as we can
at present tell indefinitely, when the aviary is moved backwards and
forwards on a bit of ground only double its own length, the vacated
half being dressed and rested for a year. More than this, an old
dressed site appears decidedly safer and more healthy than an undressed
one that has never had birds on it before ; for which reason we intend
to try the experiment of dressing even a new site before it is occupied
by an aviary for the first time to kill the germs which may have been
introduced by poultry, wild birds, etc.

THE SHAMA--THE MOST DELIGHTFUL OF

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998773105263158" page_id="56211868"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Mr. Stuart Baker, in The Fauna of British India places the Indian
xace of the Shama as a sub-species of the Malay bird which is the true
Kattacincla macroura macroura. The two are practically indistinguish-
able, but the Indian form, K. m. indica, is said to be of a richer chestnut
below and to have rather more black on the lateral tail-feathers. The
Indian Shama inhabits practically the whole of India, Burma, and
Ceylon. In its wild state it is an inhabitant of the jungles, and Mr.
Stuart Baker tells us that " it is very partial to the bamboo or mixed
bamboo and tree forests, but may be found in almost any forest which
is not too dense or which borders streams and open glades ... It is
a very late bird and may sometimes be heard singing its loudest and
sweetest as the rapid dusk of the tropical evenings fades into night ".
On account of its delightfully tame disposition and exquisite song
the Shama has long been a favourite cage bird both in India and
elsewhere, but its charms are displayed to the greatest advantage
when it is allowed the freedom of a large outdoor aviary, planted
liberally with shrubs and furnished with a pool of clear water. But
its aviary must have a covered shed which can be slightly warmed
during winter, for the Shama is only moderately hardy.

Friendly as the Shama is with human beings he is often quite the
reverse with other birds and he has been known to badly ill-treat his
own mate at times. It is as well to keep the two sexes apart during the
autumn and winter, placing them together in an aviary in the spring
when they are both ready to start nesting at once. Provide a variety
of nesting boxes, or at any rate two, so that they can make their choice,
and remember that in a wild state they would choose a hole in a decayed
tree-trunk or a tenantless Woodpeckers' hole, so give them a box to
somewhat resemble this. See that nesting material in the form of
leaves, grass, etc., is available, and to the usual diet of good insectivorous
food, mealworms and fruit, add an extra quantity of mealworms and
cockroaches, and all should go well. If you live right in the country
and have no cats you may allow the Shamas complete freedom when
once they have selected their nest and the hen has laid, and in this
way they will find plenty of insects in your garden and rear their family
without trouble. But to provide sufficient insect food to rear a healthy
brood of young Shamas in an aviary takes a lot of doing. Shamas
are freely imported from India and are almost always tame and,
provided one can give a Shama the attention that any insectivorous
bird requires, it will prove the most delightful of birds.

The Black-headed Grosbeak has been imported from time to time
by Mr. Chapman, but I am inclined to think that most of the specimens
brought over were males. At any rate, last year was the first time
I succeeded in getting a true pair, and as I have not seen any account

the Japanese Hawfinch , and the Thick-hilled Weaver 315
of the breeding of this bird I imagine that true pairs have not been
very plentiful.
The male is a handsome bird, a mixture of black, white, and orange.
The female is similarly marked but much duller. It comes from
Central America and Mexico. I have been unable to find anything
about its wild life, although I imagine it comes from the mountain
districts. I saw nothing like it on the low-lying districts of the Pacific
coast. In captivity it does well, being hardy and easy to cater for.
My birds fed principally upon sunflower and hemp, but I sometimes
saw them taking soaked bread, and they appeared to be fond of peas
in the pod. In late June they built a flimsy nest in the heart of a
thick laurel, which provided excellent cover both from rain and sun.
Three eggs were laid, green speckled all over with brown. The
incubation period was about sixteen days. All three eggs hatched.
One chick died at about a week old, and another disappeared about
a week later. On the eighteenth day a fully fledged youngster was
standing up in the nest. It looked very queer, with at least half an
inch of grey down sticking up on the top of its head like a crest. The
next day it was gone, and for ten days I saw no sign of it, and but for
the demeanour of the old birds I should have thought it was dead.
However, one sunny day I saw it sunning itself on a twig. It was
then nearly as big as its parents and in colour resembled the hen.
I may say that no special or insect food was provided, and I never at
any time noticed the parents catching flies as most birds do when
feeding young. Early in August I found them sitting again on three
eggs in a conifer. These duly hatched and lived for about ten days,
when a thunderstorm drowned them. Shortly afterwards I sold the
pair to one of our members, only to find after they were gone that
they had yet another nest containing one egg. They are probably
double-brooded in the wild state.
The tale of the Black-heads does not end here. About six weeks
after I had sent them off to their new home 1 was passing through
their aviary when I thought I glimpsed something yellow flitting
through the bushes, so I had my man trim all the bushes in it, telling
him to look out as I thought that a yellow Weaver might have got in
from the next aviary. The next day he reported that he had seen

nothing. Two days later my daughter reported that there was a new
black and yellow bird in the aviary, and on going to see I was astounded
to find a young cock Grosbeak in full colour. How it could have kept
itself concealed for more than two months is a mystery, especially
as both my daughter and I passed through the aviary twice daily.
The Japanese Hawfinch is not so handsome a bird as its Chinese
cousin, but from an avicultural point of view it is more desirable,
as the sexes are quite different. The Chinese cannot be sexed, except
by their demeanour in captivity. My Japanese birds went to nest
in late June, and as the weather at the time was favourable I had every
hope of rearing them. Three eggs, a rich olive colour streaked and
spotted with blackish-purple, were the clutch. I removed one, and
after fourteen days the other eggs hatched. The young were covered
with white down. The hen covered them very closely but for some
reason or other failed to feed them properly. I tried the old birds
with green peas, currants, and unlimited mealworms, but without
success, and the young ones died when about twelve days old, at that
time being no larger than six-day-old chicks. I don't think that the
cock fed them at all. He was evidently a bad parent. A pair I had
some years ago were ideal parents, and both cock and hen fed their
young assiduously, and if I had not worried them so much in photo-
graphing them I should no doubt have reared them. As it was the
young left the nest too soon and were drowned in a rainstorm. These
birds are worth a place in any aviary as they are harmless with the
small birds.
My thick-billed Weavers went to nest very early in the year, their
first nest being in a hazel bush. After they had been sitting a week
I removed their eggs as they were infertile. A week or two later they
nested again in a dying laurel. I removed the eggs after a day or two,
taking it for granted that these eggs were also clear, but on blowing
one of them seven or eight hours later I found that it was fertile,
so I carried the remaining egg back to the nest. The next day I saw
the hen leave the nest, so concluded that she had resumed her duties.
In due course a young one was hatched. I cannot give the incubation
period, as the nest was too deep to see into and I was disinclined to
disturb the birds by inserting a finger. Apparently everything went

well as about three weeks later the cock pulled the bottom out of
the nest and a young one emerged and disappeared into the thick
cover. This was the last I saw of it, and it either fell a victim to our
atrocious climate or was killed by another bird. Undaunted, they
again went to nest in early September. Two eggs were laid, which
hatched in thirteen days. They appeared to be doing well when we
had the most violent storm of the year, accompanied by floods of rain,
which probably prevented the birds from catering properly for the
young ones, as the nest itself withstood the downpour and remained
dry within. This, I am afraid, will be my last attempt at breeding,
as I am giving up my birds, much to my regret.

this species in Europe.
Mr. W. Goodfellow observed it at liberty during one of his trips
to Ecuador, and described it as follows, in a very interesting article
published in this Magazine in June, 1900 (Yol. YI, 1st Ser., p. 174) -
" Ranging from the level of Santo Domingo up to the outer spurs,
of the mountains, we found the exceedingly pretty little Green Toucan
A. hcematopygia. The whole of the bird is bright green of variou
shades, with some pale blue at the base of the bill and about the breast.
The primaries are blackish-olive, the rump crimson, and the tail dark
bluish-green with deep chestnut tips to the feathers. The skin around,
the eye is red, and the bill uniform dark red shaded with black, and a
pure white line at the base, much wider on the lower than on the upper
mandible. There is another Ecuadorian bird which is found on the
Eastern side, with a slight change in the markings. The difference
is that A. albivitta has a greyish-white throat, and greenish-yellow
on the bill."

My bird has a bluish throat and a dark cherry-red bill, so he is not
A. albivitta but A. hcematopygia. He was privately imported to
Marseilles, with a Yellow-rumped Tanager ( Rhamphoccelus icteronotus ;
an acquaintance of mine bought both birds, kept the Tanager for himself,
and sold me the Toucanet. He arrived in early February and had to
be kept warm, for he had caught a chill on the journey and breathed
heavily. Some honey diluted in hi,s drinking water did him much
good and after three weeks' careful nursing the bird ceased coughing
altogether. Indeed, like the other Toucans, this species is not
delicate.
No sooner had I opened his travelling-box than he came on my
hand and began to preen his feathers. He has always been very tame
and confiding ever since. He takes his food from my fingers, delights
in coming on to my arm or one of my shoulders, and he is never more
happy than when, sitting on my hand, we take a walk together around
the bird-room, looking at the different occupants of the cages and
indoor aviaries.
Though very gentle and harmless to every human being, he is
spiteful towards birds. Owing to his tameness we used to let him fly
into the bird-room : but he frightened the smaller birds in their cages
and tried to seize their food through the wire bars. So now we keep
him shut in a small aviary about 3 feet long, and he is allowed to go
out of it only when somebody is in the room. I often tried to put
other birds with him ; a cock Spot-billed Toucanet, a pair of White-
capped Glossy Starlings, or an Azure Jay, but he attacked them fiercely
and I had to take them out at once.
He takes his bath every day and then basks in the sun on the
window-sill.
I have never seen him sleep with his tail raised up above his head
as other Toucans do, or enter the box I gave him to spend the night in.
He sleeps sitting on a big branch fixed just under the roof of the aviary.
His food consists of chopped fruit, boiled potatoes, and carrots,
and bread soaked in milk.
I have never found so tame and charming a pet among the Toucans
I have possessed.

This family comprises the genera Megapodius, Eulipoa , Leipoa,
Talegallus, Alectura, Mpypodius , and Megacephalon, birds possessing
the singular habit of depositing their eggs either in a raised mound
or in sand, to be incubated by the heat produced by decomposing
vegetable matter or that of the sun's rays. The eggs are remarkably
large for the size of the bird which lays them, and the young when
hatched are independent of their parents.
They mostly have large and powerful feet for the purpose of
building their mound by scratching together the material, and the
hind toe is placed on the same level as the others. They feed on fruit,
grain, and insects.
Genus Megapodius. -- The True Megapodes
This genus contains some sixteen species, inhabiting the various
islands of the Pacific, but one only appears to have been imported alive.
Duperrey's Megapode or Scrub Fowl (M. duperreyi) has a wide
range, occurring in the north-east of Australia, Western and Southern
New Guinea, and several of the neighbouring islands. It is about
15 inches in length, the prevailing colour being brown with the mantle
grey, lower back, rump, sides, and flanks chestnut, legs orange-red.
There is a well-developed brown crest.
The mounds built by these birds as receptacles for their eggs are
remarkable for their enormous size. They are composed of loose
black vegetable mould mixed with sticks, leaves, etc. Usually
situated near to the sea-shore and sheltered by the foliage of trees,
the mounds appear to be added to each year and each year grow in
size. Gilbert records one with a circumference of 150 feet and a height
of 15 feet, while the more usual circumference at the base is about
60 feet. The eggs are placed in a vertical position in holes dug by the
birds in the mound, being placed at some 5 or 6 feet from the surface.
The holes are then filled in with loose soil. The eggs are about

The Mallee Fowl ( L . ocellata) is the sole representative of this
genus and is found in South and West Australia. It is about 24 inches
in length, furnished with a thick pointed crest on the head. The
mantle, back, and wing-coverts are grey, banded, with black and white ;
forehead and stripes over the eyes grey. The upper breast grey with
a band of black and white feathers down to the middle. Under parts
whitish barred with black. The sexes are alike.
The nest-mound is a large conical heap of sand, etc., covering
a bed of leaves and other vegetable matter of some 8 inches in thickness,
situated generally in a water course in dense scrub such as that known
as the Mallee. Size of mound about 12 feet in diameter and some
3 feet in height. The eggs are very large for the size of the bird,
being over 3J inches by some 2J inches, whitish with very thin shells.
One weighed by Campbell turned the scale at 6J ounces.
A. J. Campbell writes : " About the end of April or the beginning
of May both birds commence to clear out their old mound or construct
a new one, which is left open till June or July when leaves, etc., are
gathered therein. After the leaves are thoroughly saturated by the
winter rains they are covered up with sand. The fact that the mound
is usually situated in a shallow course or slight gully, further insures
the vegetation becoming thoroughly soaked. The female commences
to lay in September or, usually, October.
" Two or three inches of dry loose sand are thrown over the leaves,
then a tier or layer of four eggs is deposited, each placed perpendicularly
on the smaller end. The four eggs are in the form of a square, 4 or
5 inches apart. An inch or two more sand covers them, and another
tier of eggs is placed opposite the interstices of the sub-tier, and so on,
till the complement is reached, three or four tiers amounting to between
twelve and sixteen eggs."
Genus Talegallus
The genus Talegallus contains four species of Brush Turkeys
inhabiting New Guinea and some of the adjacent islands. They are
distinguished by having the sides of the head, chin, throat, and fore-
part of the neck mostly naked. There is no wattle. Only one has
been imported.

New Guinea and the Aru Islands has been imported, but very rarely.
The general colour is black, the head and back of the neck thinly covered

The sexes alike.
The nesting-mound is described by Von Rosenberg as " composed
of earth mixed with sticks and leaves, the whole forming a truncate
cone 11 feet high and 25 feet round the base. In the summit of the
cone we found the openings of five burrows which went down
perpendicularly to a depth of 4 feet, and were filled with earth. In
four of these I found eggs which were placed vertically ... In the

The Australian Brush Turkey (A. lathami) of Eastern and
North-Eastern Australia has been frequently imported into Europe,
where it has bred many times. It is distinguished from Talegallus in
possessing a wattle at the base of the neck, and in the more naked
head and neck. The general colour of this bird is brownish-black, the
under parts have the feathers edged with white. The head is more
or less naked and pinkish-red, the wattle, more developed in the
male, is bright yellow. The total length is over 25 inches.
The Brush Turkey generally selects for the site of its mound a space
in a shady wood, and here, working backwards, the male scratches
mould, leaves, and small sticks into a heap. The surface of the ground
for many yards in all directions is cleared, the bird working continuously
with its large powerful feet. During the laying season the cock bird
spends most of his time either on the mound or in scratching more
material to increase its size. The mound is generally some 12 feet
in diameter and 2 to 3 feet in height.
When the hen is about to lay she scratches a hole in the mound
some 10 to 12 inches deep, and here deposits her egg, which she places
in a vertical position and covers up, the cock then driving her away
and completing the process of filling up the hole with leaves and
vegetable mould.

322 D. Seth-Smith--The Megapodes or Mound Builders
Some 12 to 15 eggs are laid during tlie season by one hen, but it
would appear that sometimes more than one hen uses the mound.
The young are hatched by the warmth of the decomposing vegetation,
and when the chicks hatch they make their way out, probably being
assisted by the cock bird, who is frequently partially opening and
then re-covering the top of the mound. They are of a dark brown
colour with the wing-feathers well developed, and are quite independent,
going away to seek their own living and to fight their own battles.
They are easily reared in captivity when once they are hatched.

The Maleo (M. maleo) inhabits Northern Celebes and Sanghir Islands.
It is about 22 inches in length. The upper parts are blackish-brown,
the breast and abdomen a delicate pinkish-white. The naked skin
round the eye is yellowish flesh-colour, and on the head is a large horny
helmet. The feet are much smaller than those of the Brush Turkeys.
This species lives in the forests and feeds upon fruits and insects.
Its nesting habits are peculiar. Dr. A. R. Wallace has told us how,
in the months of August and September, they descend to the sea-
beach to deposit their eggs, choosing for this purpose certain bays
remote from human habitations, which they visit daily in numbers.
" In the mass of loose sand thrown up above high-water mark are seen
numbers of holes 4 or 5 feet in diameter. In and around these holes,
at a depth of 1 or 2 feet, the eggs of the Maleos are found. There are
sometimes only one or two, sometimes as many as seven or eight in
a hole, but placed each at a distance of 6 or 8 inches from the others,
and each egg laid by a separate bird. They come down to the beach,
a distance often of 10 or 15 miles, in pairs, and, choosing either a fresh
place or an old hole, scratch alternately, throwing up a complete
fountain of sand during the operation, which I had the pleasure of
observing several times. When a sufficient depth is reached, the
female deposits an egg and covers it up with sand, after which the
pair return to the forest."
The eggs are hatched by the warmth of the sun and the young
when hatched are independent of their parents. They appear to be
easily reared if captured when newly hatched, and some reared in
this manner have recently been imported to Europe.

By D. Seth-Smith
The Family Tinamid^g comprises a group of Partridge-like birds
confined to South America which present certain structural characters
which render them distinct from the true Game Birds. Some are as
large as a Fowl while others are no larger than a Quail. They have
.small heads and slender necks, short tails, and, generally, somewhat
dull plumage, the sexes in most cases being similar in appearance.
They form a link between the Game Birds and Ratitse (Ostriches,
Rheas, etc.).
The nesting habits of the Tinamous are peculiar. The eggs are
unlike those of any other group of birds, the shells resembling highly
glazed porcelain, the colour varying in the different genera from sage
green or pale blue to chocolate brown or pink. Just like the Turnix,
incubation and the rearing of the young is carried out entirely by the
male who is, as a rule, slightly smaller than the female, and in some
species at least, and probably in all, the female mates with several
males in succession during the season. The call-note of many species
is loud and somewhat musical.
Tinamous feed upon grain, insects, and doubtless wild fruits,
berries, and green shoots. They will breed readily in captivity, the
young being reared without difficulty providing a plentiful supply of
insect food such as living ants' cocoons and gentles is available. They
are moderately hardy.

Distinguished in having the hind aspect of the tarsus smooth.
Eggs pinkish, varying to clay colour. There are some thirty species
in the genus, of which the following have been imported :--*
The Brown Tinamou (C. obsoletus ) inhabits Paraguay, the
Argentine, and Brazil. Total length about 10J inches. Head and
upper part of neck dusky grey, the throat paler. The upper parts-
rufous-brown with dusky vermiculations ; lower parts chestnut ;
flanks and abdomen with brown bars to the feathers, producing a
scale-like appearance ; under tail-coverts brown, the feathers edged
with rufous.
The Pileated Tinamou (C. soni) occurs from Guiana to Brazil,
Bolivia, and Central America. It is a very variable species, about
9 inches in length, general colour more or less rufous or olive-brown,
the throat white or whitish, and the lower parts clearer.
The Tataupa Tinamou (C. tataupa ) occurs in Brazil, Paraguay,
and Bolivia. It is about 9 inches in total length. Head, neck, and
upper breast grey, throat whitish-grey, the upper parts chestnut and
abdomen whitish. Lower flanks black, each feather edged with
whitish buff. Under tail-coverts buff with black bars. In life the
plumage of this species is so well supplied with whitish powder as
to give it a uniform grey appearance on the upper parts. The bill is
bright red, the feet pinkish. An account of the breeding of this species-
in captivity, with a coloured plate of adult and young appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine for August and October, 1904. In the case
there described the female laid three clutches of eggs to two males
during the season, the eggs being incubated and the young reared
by the males.
The Undulated Tinamou (C. undulatus) inhabits Paraguay and
the Argentine, and is about 12 inches in length. Neck and back
barred black and rufous. Upper part of the head black. Lower
back and rump with black and greyish bars, the wings similarly barred.
Middle of the breast whitish. This species has not often been imported.

The Variegated Tinamou (C. variegatus) of Guiana and Lower
Amazonia is about 11 inches in length, has the upper part of the head
blackish-browm; the throat white, neck rufous, back regularly
banded with olive-rufous and black bars ; the abdomen fulvous,
becoming white at the lower part. The female is said to differ slightly
from the male, the lower parts being less whitish and more rufous.
The Banded Tinamou (C. noctivagus) occurs in Eastern Brazil
and is about 13 inches in length. The front half of the crown is blackish,
the posterior half and the nape vinous-brown, a broad rufous
superciliary stripe extending down the sides of the occiput. The
back brown, flecked with narrow dusky bars. The lower foreneck grey,
the breast rufous, and the abdomen buff. The female differs from
the male in having the wings regularly barred with yellowish buff,
and the remainder of the upper parts more distinctly barred.
The Cinnamon Tinamou (C. cinnamomeus) occurs in Southern
Mexico, Central America, and Venezuela. It is about 12 inches in
length. The forehead is brown-black, the crown chestnut-brown
with black bars ; sides of the head and neck rufous, throat white ;
back olive-brown, with dusky bars which become broader on the
rump and upper tail-coverts ; the breast bright rufous and the abdomen
paler. In the female the transverse bars are more developed and
cover the top of the head and the front of the breast.

The Rufous Tinamou (R. rufesceus) occurs in Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay, and the Argentine. It is a large Tinamou, measuring from
14 to 17 inches, the female being slightly larger than the male. As
its name implies the prevailing colour is rufous, the lower flanks and
abdomen greyish. The plumage is more or less barred with brown
and buff ; the primaries are uniform rufous.
The Rufous Tinamou breeds freely in captivity, given suitable
accommodation, the female laying from six to ten eggs, biconical in
shape and of a purplish-brown colour. The nest is situated on the
ground, like that of a Pheasant, but the duty of incubation and the
rearing of the young is undertaken entirely by the male, while the
female goes off in search of another mate.

The Cinereous Tinamou (N. cinerascens) inhabits the Western
Argentine Republic. It is about 12-5 inches in length, the upper
parts being greyish, barred with black, and each feather of the back
with two whitish stripes. There is a broad superciliary stripe and the
cheeks are white spotted with black. The breast grey, the neck spotted
with blackish and white and the breast with dusky lines and white
spots. Abdomen, white. The female is somewhat larger than the
male and browner on the upper parts. The under wing-coverts
regularly barred with whitish-buff and greyish-brown.
The Chilian Tinamou ( N . perdicaria) inhabits Northern and
Central Chile, and may be distinguished from the preceding by the
under wing-coverts being without bars, the upper parts dull greyish,
and the mesial part of the feathers of the back much blacker. The
eggs of Nothoprocta are biconical in shape and dark purplish-brown
in colour.
Genus Nothura
The Spotted Tinamou ( N . maculosa) inhabits the Argentine,
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Southern Brazil. A small Tinamou of about
10 inches in length. The upper parts are pale yellowish-brown, barred
with black and brown and streaked with fulvous white. Throat,
white. The breast spotted with brown, the flanks with crescentic
brown bars. The eggs are very like those of Nothoprocta.
The genus Calopezus has been placed, with one other genus, in a
separate sub-F amily--T inamotidin^e.
The Martinetta Tinamou (C. elegans) occurs in the Argentine
and Lower Uruguay. It is easily distinguished by its long recurved
vertical crest and by the absence of a hind toe. It is densely banded
and spotted with black and pale fulvous, the head greyish, each feather
with a black streak. Two whitish bands commence above the eyes
and run along the sides of the nape, while another starts from the
base of the upper mandible and crosses the cheeks below the eyes.
The sexes are similar. The eggs are bright green, sometimes yellowish-
green. A very desirable species that breeds freely in captivity but
is less often imported now than previously.

By Lady Wavertree, C.B.E.
The Boyal Starlings made no attempt to nest whilst in the aviaries-
with the larger birds, but on being placed with the small birds soon
began to nest; there were various nesting-boxes for them to choose
from and their selection was a Budgerigar box. A nest was made-
of leaves and moss lined with feathers. Four eggs were laid, all of
the same size, colour, and markings as our English Blackbird. Incuba-
tion took a fortnight and two young were hatched out of the four and
were reared on mealworms and ants' eggs. The hen only sat during
incubation. At three weeks the young birds began looking out of the
box and were out in the fourth w T eek, flying fairly well. The amount
of food these young birds took was really astounding, as many as-
eight mealworms at a time being held in the parent's beak when feeding,
and they would hold so many ants' eggs--probably twenty to thirty--
in the beak that they were bunched as big as an acorn. The colour
of the young birds' first plumage was quite plain, being a dull blue,,
almost black, and a fawn colour on breast. They are now coming
into their natural colour, the yellow showing up on the breast and a rich-
green and blue on head and back, and their tail-feathers are growing
like those of the parents. They are strong and in fine condition.
I cleared out the old nest and on 6th September the parent birds started
building again, and on the 11th one egg was laid. Then I found the
hen was egg-bound and very mopey. I gave her mealworms dipped
in medicated paraffin four times a day and she laid again two days-
after and the next day there were three eggs. She is now sitting
and should hatch out about the end of the month if the eggs are fertile.
Black-winged Grackles hatched on the 15th of June, 1930. These
birds were very vicious during the nesting period and I had to cage
off several birds that they objected to. Their nest was in a large box
with three divisions, with a round hole cut for entrance to each com-
partment. They took the outside berth and built their nest of leaves,.
pine needles, and bits of paper. The hen laid four eggs of a pale blue-

tion occupied a fortnight and the young soon began to make themselves
heard. They were fed in a similar manner to the Royal Starlings, the
parents carrying eight or more mealworms at a time for feeding. They
did not take as many ants' eggs as the Royal Starlings and much
preferred the mealworms. As soon as the young birds were out and
able to feed themselves the old birds drove them off and started a
second nest, from which two young birds were hatched, but one fell out
of the nest and was killed. The young birds are doing well and look
strong and healthy ; their colour is grey and black and they did not
show any yellow on the sides of the head until September, but they
are now turning white and black like their parents.

Breeding results here this season have been quite satisfactory
in spite of a particularly vile summer.
Of the rare Australian Parrakeets all those that bred in 1929--
Many-colours, Barrabands, and Browns--have again been successful,
and in addition broods of the extremely scarce Turquoisines and
Elegants have also been reared.
Of the Finches, Gouldians, Zebra Finches, Ruficaudas, and Long-
tailed Grass Finches have all produced families, as have White Java
Sparrows and Bengalese.
The following gives the largest number of young reared by a single

. 1 nest, started very late.
The following did not breed : Derbyan, Malabar, and Hooded
Parrakeets and Pectoralis Finches.
The Pair of Brown's Parrakeets that reared seven young, two cocks
and two hens in the first nest and two cocks and one hen in the second,
produced equally fine birds in each nest. The hen laid, hatched, and
reared all four eggs in the first nest, and of her second clutch of five,
four hatched and one was infertile ; so that in all eight young would
have been reared but for the fact that the fourth young one of the last
nest managed to pierce itself with one of the small wood splinters
its mother had peeled from the side of the box, on which to lay her eggs.
A pair of Turquoisines reared four young which turned out to be
three hens and one cock, a preponderance of hens being apparently
usual with these birds. One point of interest is that whereas all the
old books give one to understand that a young cock Turquoisine is
quite impossible to mistake for a hen, in actual fact we have proved
this to be entirely inaccurate. Young hens have been rightly described
as like their mother, but a young cock, far from being a dull edition
of its father is indistinguishable from a young hen for at least a fortnight,
when the future red wing-patches begin to appear as a faint orange
glow, and even at this stage there is no more blue on the face, and
little more on the wing, than in a hen of the same age.

380 E. J. Boosey and Alec Brooksbank--Breeding Besults
The Elegants which nested early in the year made no attempt to
breed again, and it seems rather surprising that a bird so closely related
to a Turquoisine should only be single-brooded.
Approximately 1,000 Budgerigars have been reared, which maintains
our last season's average of 12 to the pair. We have quite definitely
come to the conclusion that they breed better in comparatively small
aviaries. Young bred in an aviary 50 feet long are neither larger
nor stronger than those reared in an aviary a tenth of its size.
The Derbyans examined a nest-box but got no further. The cock
is tame but his wife extremely timid.
The pair of two-year-old Malabars looked like breeding in April.
Indeed the hen had hollowed out a scoop at the bottom of the nest-box
and seemed on the point of laying, when she suddenly and surprisingly
started to moult.
Hooded Parrakeets indulged in the usual lengthy summer moult,
coming into breeding condition about the beginning of October, when
it was much too late to allow them to breed. The hen is at present
trying to excavate a hole in the outside flight, under a piece of turf
which has to be frequently moved in case she should be under the
impression that she has made a nest and should attempt to lay.
Ruficaudas have a charming and unusual courting display in which
the cock, holding a long grass in his beak, flies from end to end of the
aviary making an extraordinarily loud clapping sound, which is
apparently produced by bringing the wings together both above and
below the body. We hear from Australia that they are rapidly
becomin rarities even in their own country.
Approximately 400 Zebra Einches have been reared and one
younster which we have kept for experimental breeding purposes
started as a more or less normally coloured bird but has moulted
out with a completely white head, nearly white wings and tail,
and numerous other white feathers all over its body. We hope to get
a pure white bird next year.
The Long-tailed Grass Einches, newly imported in the spring, have
been very prolific. Four birds which appeared to be most obvious
cocks with large black bibs were put together in an aviary, but we
discovered later that all had deposited numerous eggs in one nest-box 1

Which, shows how extremely difficult they are to sex. The young of
this species seem to attain adult plumage almost as quickly as Zebra
Finches.
The Gouldians, as usual, did not start breeding until the end of
the summer, and at present sixteen young are fledged from five pairs
and two more broods have just hatched. It is rather doubtful whether
the latter will survive the cold weather, in which case we shall not have
done so well as last year, when twenty-three were reared from four
pairs. At the end of last season we were unfortunate in that the ten
Gouldians we kept for future breeding moulted out this summer into
one hen and nine cocks. We are afraid we shall have to disappoint
a good many of our customers over these birds.
We believe that the total of fourteen young produced by one pair
of Diamond Doves is possibly a record, and is of interest particularly
as the small Doves are usually anything but reliable parents. This
pair successfully hatched and reared every egg they laid, and since a
few twigs were added as each brood left the nest, the hen was eventually
sitting on a pile nearly 6 inches high. At the other end of the scale
one pair only succeeded in bringing up a single young one during
the whole season.
A pair of White Java Sparrows had three white young in the first
nest and two grey and two white in the second nest. Of the latter,
just fledged, whereas the two whites have pink beaks the two greys
have black ones ; though all four will eventually have beaks of the
usual red. It would, therefore, appear that not only have the white
variety acquired white plumage, but have evolved one step further
in that they have decided to dispense with the boring period of waiting
between being born with a black beak and acquiring a pink one.
Generally speaking we have found that the late spring suited the
Parrakeets better than the Finches, whose nesting arrangements
it considerably retarded. Among the Parrakeets, particularly, the
percentage of fertile eggs was noticeably high.
[Messrs Boosey and Brooksbank are to be very heartily
congratulated on their success. --Ed.]

Students of ornithology have always regarded Norfolk as one of
the most interesting counties in the British Isles, and a book on its
birds by one who thoroughly knows his subject, as Mr. Riviere certainly
does, will be welcomed by bird-lovers. Norfolk is situated in the track
of a vast migration movement that takes place regularly in spring
and autumn, and its physical features are eminently suitable for bird
life. Breydon Water, at low tide, presents a vast expanse of mud-
flats that attract every species of wader that visits our shores, including
Spoonbills and Avocets and many other rarities. The most northern
points, Blakeney and Cley, are famous as the halting-places for migrants
in spring and autumn, and from this region many species of extreme
rarity have been recorded, while a large colony of Terns regularly
breed there and vast numbers of Wigeon and Brent Geese frequent
the Blakeney Channel during winter.
The well-known Broads, with their adjacent reed-beds, support
a rich insect and plant life, and hence are much frequented by birds
of many kinds, both migrants and breeding species, including some, such
as the Bearded Tit, Bittern, Marsh and Montagu's Harriers, which
are practically confined to this area. Breckland is another celebrated
area for birds with its miles of arid sand with here and there a mere.
Here are found the Woodlark, Nightjar, Wheatear, Stonechat, Whin-
chat, Yellow Wagtail, Stone Curlew, Stock Dove, Lapwing, Snipe,
and Redshank, and a colony of inland-breeding Ringed Plovers,
\0x25A0while many species of Duck breed in the district. This area will lose
some of its characteristic birds in a few years owing to a system of
planting trees which has been instituted by the Forestry Commission
to the benefit of the land in other ways.
Bird protection has done much to help the bird-life of Norfolk,
as it has of other districts, and great credit is due to the Norfolk and

is one of tlie most interesting that could be written of any species.
Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century this bird was abundant
as a breeding species, but it could not stand the persecution it received,
and its numbers gradually decreased until it became extinct as a
breeding bird. In 1900, however, one was again heard booming
in the Broads district, and in 1911 a young bird was seen and photo-
graphed. From then onwards, thanks to stringent protection and
to the change in public opinion which now denounces the wanton
destruction of bird life, the Bittern has continued to increase in numbers
and at the present time is thoroughly re-established as a Norfolk
breeding bird.
The author describes no less than 342 species which have been
definitely admitted as Norfolk birds, and others whose claims have
not been fully substantiated. Very full accounts of all are given,
together with a number of black and white plates and an excellent map.

A certain charm and fascination surrounds those birds, the Golden
Eagle, Ptarmigan, and others, which spend their lives and rear their
young amongst the high and often almost inaccessible hills of Scotland ;
but to study them and learn the secrets of their lives one must be
active and tough and prepared to spend days and nights, in fair weather
and storm, amongst them. Thus will their secrets be revealed to him
who has shown patience and endurance. Mr. Seton Gordon has
extracted from these birds much information regarding their private
lives, and has succeeded in producing a very delightful book which
some amongst us may already have seen, for it was first published
in 1915. Many of us, however, had not seen it, and the reprint just
published will be welcomed. Twenty-four species are dealt with
by a writer who has a very delightful way of making us see what he
has seen and which he so well describes.
The book is well illustrated by photographs.

In Secrets of Bird Life 1 the authors give us a series of chapters which
take us away to the pine forests of Scotland where we meet with the
Capercaillie and the Crested Tit, the moorlands and valleys where we
find the Grouse, the Golden Plover, the Greenshank and the Dunlin ;
or to Mid Wales where we meet with the Buzzard and, if we are fortunate,
perhaps a pair of the few surviving Kites. They take us to many
other places where they can show us birds with their nests and teach
us some of their secrets which we were ignorant of. They have spent
much time in their endeavour to find the carefully concealed nests of
our rarer and most interesting birds for the purpose of studying and
photographing them, and the result is a book of absorbing interest to
the bird-lover and a series of very charming photographs.

The breeding season for birds in Australia commences about
September. Mr. S. Harvey, of Adelaide, has begun well, for he writes
(9th September) : "I have five pairs of Turquoisines nesting. Two
pairs are sitting, one pair has four eggs, one pair one egg, one pair
two eggs. Also three pairs of Elegants sitting." We must all wish
Mr. Harvey success in his endeavours to increase and multiply these
rare and beautiful Parrakeets.
The October number of our American contemporary Aviculture
contains some interesting breeding records. Mr. J. V. Patton has
successfully bred the Palawan or Napoleon Peacock Pheasant (Poly-
plectron emphanes), a species first imported to America a year or so
ago and of which a few pairs have just reached England. It is
undoubtedly the most beautiful of all the Peacock Pheasants, and a
most desirable bird from the avicultural point of view. Its habits
appear to be similar to those of the other members of the genus.

In the same number Mr. Malcolm Davis records the successful
breeding of the American White Pelican in the Washington Zoo. Two
young were hatched, but one of these was trodden upon and killed
by its parent. The other survived and was reared. Mr. Davis writes
thus of the young bird : 4 ' It is not a thing of beauty, being red and
plump, but one of interest. The bird remained in the nest about
three weeks. I did not have the opportunity to witness the feeding
of the young by the adult. Probably due to the presence of curious
visitors the process of regurgitation was delayed to late evening or
night. From the naked stage the baby developed quite rapidly.
Soon the body was covered with down, and the flight-feathers began
to show . . . The bird, now about four months old, resembles the
mature specimen, except that the feet and beak are a dull orange
colour."
This is the second time this Pelican has successfully bred in the
Washington Zoological Gardens.
Dr. Leon Patrick has been successful with Parrakeets, having bred
the Pileated ( Porphyrocephalus spurius) and the Blue-winged Grass
Parrakeet ( Neophema venusta), while the Sarus Crane and Golden-
crowned Conure have been bred by Mr. Wigley, and the Elegant
Parrakeet (N. elegans ) by Mr. J. H. Arnold.
According to The Gardeners&amp;apos; Chronicle Sir William Lawrence is
afraid of a plague of Green Parrots in Epping Forest, and the following
letter which appeared in the issue of 18th October is of considerable
interest. Mr. Stoker, the writer of the letter, has described the birds
to me, and they are evidently either Ringnecks or Alexandrines :--
" Gkeen Parrots. --In the issue of The Gardeners&amp;apos; Chronicle
for 11th October, Sir William Lawrence refers to a threatened plague
of Green Parrots in Epping Forest; I hope he will forgive me

William is right in stating that no fewer than five have been seen
in a Loughton garden : indeed, as this is the garden favoured
by the birds, I can state definitely that the number reached seven

during the summer. The first Parrot arrived almost exactly two
years ago. Whence it came, no one can tell, but presumably it was
an # escape He lived alone in the garden through the dreadful
winter of 1928-9, getting what protection he could in dense hollies.
In the spring he scraped acquaintance with a captive female a short
distance away, whose cage was commonly placed in the open in
fine weather. But love, laughing as mockingly at cages as ever it
did at locksmiths, apparently overcame the difficulty, for on one
eventful day the owner of the female bird was astounded to find
the bars of her cage forced apart, and the prisoner gone. Thereafter
we had two Parrots in the garden, and here they lived in dual
harmony until the recent outbreak of psittacosis, when two apparent
exiles joined them. The four birds took up permanent quarters
in holes in old elms after dispossessing the previous tenants, to wit,
two pairs of Jackdaws. Here- they bred this spring, and the total
number increased to seven. I have not heard of there being any
other colony in or near Epping Forest, and our birds, if I may use
the possessive pronoun, are very faithful to their habitat. Two,
or possibly three, have disappeared, and I fear they have been
shot by vandals. There have been rumours, up to the present
unconfirmed, of their depredations on our neighbours' plums,
but we ourselves have suffered nothing from their supposed destruc-
tiveness. Their favourite diet at the moment appears to be crab
apples, which they split open, extract the seeds, and reject the pulp.
Almost any day in winter they may be seen eating holly berries
while swinging on a branch, and very beautiful they appear.
Personally, I would allow them very considerable latitude in the
matter of food for the joy of having them in the garden, and I
feel sure that if Sir William Lawrence could view their tricks, their
gambols, and their radiance, he would be the last to virtually
bracket them with that undoubted and unrepentant villain, the
grey squirrel.-- Fred Stoker, The Summit, Loughton."

THE SPOT-HEADED WEAVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967355823529412" page_id="56211898"  page_num="337" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I was glad to see a picture of an old favourite of mine in the
October Magazine-- the Spot-headed or Black-backed Weaver--
though I am afraid that the illustration hardly does him justice ;
the breast is a wonderful glowing orange, in fact the bird looks like
a brilliant living flame as it flits about in the sombre gloom of its forest
home. The back, too, seems more of a glossy blue colour.
I was familiar with these strange aberrant Weavers when living
on the edge of a tropical forest on the borders of Portuguese East Africa.
As you say, their habits differ entirely from those of the rest of the
family. On first seeing them I thought that they were Creepers of
some kind, as they ran up and down the trunks of trees and climbed
about the masses of creepers which hung down from the tree-tops
in their search for insects on which, I believe, they entirely subsist.
I never saw any descend to the ground, and in fact never observed
them at a distance of less than about 50 feet from the earth.
The nests of these birds are marvels of bird architecture, being
composed (at least in the district where I was) mainly of fine hair-like
orchid roots which the birds pull from the tree-trunks, the nest being
almost transparent, one being able to see with the aid of binoculars
both the sitting bird and the eggs.
I know of no bird which places its nest in such an inaccessible
position, nearly always on the end of a very long slender branch which
has been stripped of all leaves and which hangs over a clearing in the
forest. The site is very cleverly chosen and shows great intelligence
on the part of the birds, for they are safe from every foe except the man
with a shot-gun.
These weavers are known locally as the " Hinge-birds " owing
to their song being like the noise of a door being slowly blown back
and forward on rusty hinges.
I would be interested to hear what these birds have been fed upon
in confinement, for I do not think that they would survive long on
seed alone.

YOUNG PLUMAGE OF FEMALE GREY-HEADED
SHELDRAKE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995970210526316" page_id="56211899"  page_num="338" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The male and one female of the three South African Grey-
headed Sheldrakes put on the lake at St. James's Park this year having
bred and reared six young, it may be put on record that the young
females, which made up half the brood, had at first grey heads like the
three young males ; the white on the head characteristic of the female,
however, soon appeared, though not reaching so far back as it does in
old females, in which it invades the neck. I had noted years ago that
in the closely allied Ruddy Sheldrake young females resembled young
males at first in head colour ; but in this species, the head being buff,
the white face marking of the female is less conspicuous, and seems not
to be noticed generally by authors. The odd female of the Grey-
headed species at St. James's has kept by herself, but as a female
Ruddy Sheldrake is also going about alone, though there are at least
two bachelor males of the species, this is not surprising--Sheldrakes
evidently do not mate readily. The South African birds here are
far less noisy and pugnacious than Ruddy Sheldrakes, and spend much
more time on the water ; in fact, they are more like Mallard than like
their near allies in these respects.

<bodyText confidence="0.996377310344828" page_id="56211900"  page_num="339" year="" vol="">
Sir, --Mrs. Irvine's article calls for a completion of her little friend's
tale, which was cut short by Mrs. Irvine's illness.
Cutty and his missus arrived in my aviary on 21st May, and were
at once allowed full liberty.
That is they shared the cold aviary with some sixty odd other
Finches, Whydahs, Weavers, and Buntings. This aviary has a closed
shelter 12 feet by 10 feet and a flight 18 ft. by 10 ft. by 12 ft., planted
with shrubs of Barbary box and privet, and is only heated in extremely
cold weather.
I very soon discovered they were both fond of mealworms. For
on feeding the Peking Robins with them as usual in the evening, the
Cut-throats were on the spot, and nearly as sharp as the Pekings at
taking the mealworms from my fingers.
They got no special foods or any different treatment to the other
birds, with whom they were on good terms at once. In fact, beyond
the evening feed of mealworms I saw little of them among the crowd.
They did come to the wire at times, when I was watching the birds,
and ask for more just as the Robins do, but they only get the tit-bit
just before going to roost.
So it was with considerable surprise and satisfaction that on 17th
July I saw the two old birds feeding three fully fledged young--one
cock and two hens. Where they nested I cannot say, for to this day
I have not discovered the site. I can't say I've looked very hard,
because I believe that too much inquisitiveness and fussing about is
responsible for many failures among nesting birds. Canaries may
stand it. Not so the semi-wild birds we are cultivating. As to the
feeding, I quite agree with your note at foot of Mrs. Irvine's article.
A plain diet of mixed seed such as I have mentioned in my " Notes from
a Lancashire Aviary " does not over-stimulate, yet provides plenty of

variety. At any rate, my birds seem to thrive on it, and this is all
Cutty and bis mate have had since they came to me.
Of course, they have had ample green food and insects caught in
the flight. A fresh supply of weeds is thrown down each morning
all through the Spring, Summer, and Autumn until the supply fails.
As evidence of the demand for green food you have only to see the state
of the evergeen bushes after the winter. Some have to be covered
with wire netting, and one large Prunus was killed, being too large
to net.
Given similar treatment there should be no difficulty in keeping
hardy birds in health, and if healthy, breeding usually follows.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE GOLDEN-BREASTED
BUNTING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988988785714286" page_id="56211901"  page_num="340" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I was very interested to read in the October Magazine of
the nesting and hatching of the Golden-breasted Bunting. In 1910
I purchased a pair of these birds from the late Mr. Yealland, and the
following year they went to nest and four eggs were laid in June.
I cannot quite remember the date, but after sitting well two young were
hatched. One, however, was a weakling and died shortly after leaving
the nest; the other being a fine healthy bird which I exhibited a year
later at the Kettering Rifle Band Annual Show, where it secured
second prize. That well-known exhibitor and judge, Mr. R. J. Howe,
made the awards, and he sent a full report of the breeding and rearing
of this bird to Canary and Cage Bird Life, also a full description to the
late Mr. Westly T. Page. I wish our member the best of luck in 1931,
and hope he will be successful in breeding them once again.
