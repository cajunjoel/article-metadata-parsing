1906-7.
In presenting the fifth complete volume of the New Series
— the thirteenth annual volume of the Avicultural Magazine —
the Council believes that it will be found quite up to, if not above,
the average of the past volumes in interest. Six coloured, nine-
teen uncoloured plates, and some text illustrations have been
published, and many very valuable articles have appeared.
Our members have given us a list, of quite a respectable
length, of birds which they have bred, it is believed for the first
time in the United Kingdom. Accounts of the successful nest-
ing of the following species have appeared: Mrs. Johnstone,
Fraser&apos;s or the Great-billed Touracou (Turacus viacrorhynchus)
and the Lorikeet (Trichoglossus johnstonics) which was named
after her; Mr. W. H. St. Quintin, the Pine Grosbeak (Pyrrhula
emicleator 7 ) ; Mr. J. H. Gurney, the Jackal Buzzard (Buteo jackal) ;
Mr. F. J. Brook, the White-eared Conure- (Pyrrtoira leucotis) ;
Mr. W. E. Teschemaker, the Yellow-rumped Finch (Mu?iia
flaviprymna}, and the Yellow-rumped or Black-throated Serin
{Serinus a?igole?isis) ; and Mr. W. R. Fasey, the Adelaide Parrakeet
(Platycercus adelaidensis).
Through the enterprise of two of our members — Mrs.
Johnstone and Sir William Ingram, — and the energy of their
collectors, Messrs. Goodfellow and Pratt, the year 1907 has been
marked by the arrival of quite a remarkable collection of living
Birds-of-Paradise (pages 242 and 324).
The experiment organized by members of the Avicultural
Society, of liberating certain species of foreign Doves in Regent&apos;s
Park, accounts of which, are published in this volume, appears,
so far, to have been a success ; two species, namely, Ocyphaps
lophotes and Tiirtur senegalensis , are known to have reared young,
the former freely. It would seem to be desirable, from time to
time, to liberate additional specimens of these harmless and
beautiful birds, in order to keep up the stock.
The membership of the Society remains about the same as

last year as regards numbers, which is not quite satisfactory as
we feel sure there are still numbers of persons who only need to
know of the Society in order to join us. We would urge upon
our present members the desirability of introducing others.
It would greatly lessen an unnecessary drain on our re-
sources if members who intend to resign would communicate the
fact to the Honorary Secretary as early in the year as possible
instead of allowing numerous notices to be sent out.
Our grateful thanks are due to those members who have
helped us in the production of the present volume, either by
their contributions to its pages or the introduction of new mem-
bers. Our sincere thanks are also due to those who have so
kindly contributed towards the Illustration Fund.

The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of the hatching of the young, and furnish
such evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The
Medal will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old
enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silver in very special cases), and measures i\ inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words &amp;quot;The Avicultural Society— Founded 1894.&amp;quot;
On the reverse is the following inscription: &amp;quot; Awarded to (name oj donee)
for rearing young of (name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom.

The genus Cotumix, comprising the true Quails, consists
of but seven species or, if we consider the Cape form to be but a
subspecies, six species only, one of which, C. nov&amp;lt;z-zealandi&amp;lt;z is
now extinct or on the verge of extinction.
The species are as follows :
i. Cotumix cotumix, the common Migratory Quail which
ranges over the greater part of Europe, Africa and
Asia.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.990868363636364">
2. C. capensis, the Cape Quail, inhabiting South Africa, Mada-
gascar etc.
3. C. japonica, the Japanese Quail, inhabiting Japan, South-
East Mongolia and China.
4. C. coromandelica, the Rain-Quail, inhabiting the greater part
of the Indian Peninsula.
5. C. delegorgtiei, the Harlequin or Delegorgue&apos;s Quail, inhabit-
ing Central and South Africa.
6. C. pectoralis, the Australian Stubble Quail, confined to Aus-
tralia and Tasmania.
7. C. novce-zealandicB, the New Zealand Quail, now said to be
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.967989" page_id="33228935"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
extinct.
With the exception of C. japonica and, of course, C. novce-
zealandicB I have kept all of the species of Cotumix in my aviary,
and have reared young from three of them, so I propose to give
some notes on these birds from observations made from my
living examples.

24 Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
In the first place it may be well to point out where the
members of this genus chiefly differ from those of such nearly-
allied genera as Synceciis (Swamp Quails) and Excalfactoria
(Painted Quails). In a very able paper on the genus Coturnix,
published in the Aniials and Magazine of Natural History (1892,
p. 167), Mr. Ogilvie-Grant writes &amp;quot;The genus Syncecus appears to
be very doubtfully distinct from Coturnix; so far as I can see,
the only tangible character by which the two can be distinguished
is found in the axillaries, which are shorter and greyer in the
former. I think it highly probable that Syncec7is will have to be
merged in Coturnix.&amp;quot; Thus, so far as cabinet ornithology is
concerned, there is practically nothing by which to separate the
two genera. They are however perfectly distinct in life. In the
first place the appearance of the Swamp Quails is quite different
from that of the true Quails, they appear to be much shorter on
the legs than the latter, but run much faster. They are much
more like miniature Partridges than like Quails. But the most im-
portant point in which the two genera differ is in their breeding
habits. Both Syncecus and Excalfactoria are strictly monogamous,
and both sexes brood the young, whereas Coturnix is semi-polyga-
mous, by which I mean that, although a male will pair with only
one female at a time, and remain true to her until incubation
commences, he will promptly leave her when this period arrives
and seek another mate. If the birds are in an enclosure where
there is no other hen quail, there is a danger of the cock bullying
the hen and perhaps driving her off her nest. When the young
are hatched the cock Coturnix does not attempt to brood them,
in fact if he approaches he is promptly driven off by the hen ; or
he may prove aggressive and drive her from her young which,
without their mother&apos;s warmth, promptly die.
To return to the species of Coturnix in their proper order:
Coturnix coturnix. I have had little experience in keeping
the common Migrator}&apos; Quail. A pair spent last winter and the
early spring in my aviary and I found them very wild and, I
think, the least interesting quails I have kept and, as I had not
room for them when the nesting season approached, they were
despatched to the Zoo. This species would doubtless breed in
captivity without trouble, providing they had a fair-sized patch

of tough grass and other shelter such as low bushes or brush-
wood, but there are other quails whose habits are practically
similar but which are tamer and more beauliful, so that C. cotur-
nix seemed to me to be hardly worth troubling about as my space
was limited.
Figure I. on the accompanying plate represents a typical
male example of C. colurnix, but this species is very subject to
variation, and many European specimens have the cheeks almost
as reddish in colour as the form which is found in South Africa
and has been separated as C. capensis or C. africana. Mr. Frank
Finn tells me that in India the quails seem to be very true to-
type, andhe has never seen one there with the reddish cheeks.
Cotumix capensis. The Cape Quail (see plate, fig. II.) is a
resident form and differs from C. cotumix only in the red colour-
ing of the cheeks and reddish tinge on other parts of the body.
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant considers it entitled to sub-specific rank only,
and states that it interbreeds freely with the Common Quail. Mr.
W. L. Sclater, who follows Reichenow in using the synonym
ajricana for this quail, states that all of the specimens he has
come across from South Africa are undoubtedly referable to the
red-cheeked form. The pair of C. capensis which lived some
months in my aviary were sent with the pair of C. colur?iix to the
Zoological Gardens as I had no room for them during the breed-
ing season. I therefore had no opporunity to study the nesting
habits of this form. My pair were very wild like the Common
Quails.
Cotumix japonica. The Japanese Quail (see plate, fig. III.)
is said to be a good species, but it is very closely allied to C. co-
tumix with which it is said to interbreed freely in the wild state.
From an examination of the series of specimens in the British
Museum I should be very much inclined to call this also a sub-
species of C. cotumix; but there is one character which Mr.
Ogilvie-Grant has pointed out and illustrated {Ann. df Mag. Nat.
Hist. (6), X. p. 171) which is perhaps sufficient to separate it
specifically. In the female the feathers of the chin and throat
are elongated and pointed as in none of the other species of the

Cotumix coromandelica. The Rain - Quail (fig. IV.) is
somewhat smaller than the species above referred to and
absolutely distinct, its nearest ally being C. delegorguei of Africa.
The female however is much like the female of the Common
Quail only smaller. In fact in all of the true quails the females
are very much alike ; plain little brown birds without any con-
spicuous markings, that of C. delegorguei being the most distinct.
The Rain-Quail is not very often imported, but it is a very
■charming bird for a well-turfed aviary, and although very wild
when first received, soon gets tame, and breeds quite freely.
The hen generally selects for her nest a spot beneath a tuft of
grass, or in the midst of a heap of hay and rubbish. The hen is
an excellent sitter and her plumage harmonizes wonderfully
with her surroundings. The eggs, as in the other species of
this genus, vary considerably, but the usual ground-colour is
buff or stone-colour which is heavily blotched and spotted with
dark brown. Measurement in inches no x &apos;85. In my aviary
the usual clutch has been six or seven, but nine is no un-
common number for these quails. Incubation is completed in
from sixteen to eighteen days, the period varying slightly accord-
ing to the temperature of the weather. Here I may remark
that it is not always easy to determine the exact period of
incubation as the sitting bird does not leave the nest until
some hours after the chicks are actually hatched. A hen Rain-
Quail which commenced to sit early in the day of July 12th left
the nest with her brood on the morning of the 29th, which
would apparently fix the period of incubation at 17^ days, but it
is probable that she actually hatched late on the previous day
or during the night. As a rule two broods are reared during
the year, the first in May or June, and the second in July or
August. The chicks when first hatched, are covered with
a thick fluffy down, the head and underparts being bright
yellowish buff-colour, two stripes of the same colour passing
down the back. The centre stripe down the back and two

stripes passing down the back of the head are dark brown, the
sides of the body being suffused with this colour. The markings
of the young of the true quails are practically the same in all of
the species, though the colour differs somewhat.
At the conclusion of these notes I propose to explain the
method I have adopted for the rearing of the young of this and.
other species of quails.

Coturnix delegorguei (fig. V.). The Harlequin or Delegorgue&apos;s
Quail is the rarest, the most beautiful and the tamest, so far as
my experience goes, of the true quails. In size it is about equal
to the Rain-Quail but the male differs from this in having a much
broader black patch on the breast, and the flanks deep chestnut
brown. It is an exceedingly handsome species, but one that is
very rarely imported. The Zoological Society appear to have
received their first example in July, 1869,* another in 1873, others
in 1883 and 1884, since which the species appears to have been
unrepresented in the Society&apos;s collection. In the year 1886
others were imported, for Mr. R. Phillipps informs me that one
London dealer had fully eighteen living specimens, and he
purchased a pair, and an odd female the following spring.
Between June 7th and June 22nd, 1887, eight eggs were laid in
In the List of the Veriebrated Animals this species is entered under the synonym

Mr. Phillipps&apos; aviary, but the hen did not sit. In 1889 Mr.
Phillipps secured another cock bird, presumably a survivor of the
importation of 1886. He writes me &amp;quot; they were very tame nice
birds and I liked them very much. They would breed freely and
easily if given fair play.&amp;quot;
In the autumn of last year Mr. Thorpe, the well-known
dealer at Hull, imported a few examples of this species, and I
secured a cock and two hens. They spent the winter in a warm
aviary, and were transferred to the larger outer aviary in April.
On the 23rd of May one of the hens commenced to sit on eleven
-eggs. The nest was made in some hay that had been thrown
down in a corner for the other birds in the aviary to build with.
The sitting bird would carefully draw the hay entirely over her
so that she was quite invisible. On June 8th she left the nest
with eight chicks — incubation having lasted sixteen days. I did
not expect the bird to hatch so soon and was away from home on
the eventful day, not returning until late in the evening. The
next morning I found the hen with six chicks only, and
subsequently discovered that she had led her brood into an
adjoining compartment of the aviary from which she had
returned with six only, the other two being unable to climb over
a wooden step separating the two compartments. This shows the
importance of being on the spot when any young ground birds
are hatched. Had I been at home that day I should have reared
a brood of eight young Harlequins ; as it was I had to be content
with six. They were perfectly easy to rear in the way I shall
presently describe.
On July 4th the same hen commenced to sit on a second
clutch of seven eggs of which she hatched six on the 19th, all of
which were reared.
The young quails were very precocious in their develop-
ment as will be seen from the following dates, which refer to the
first brood.

The eggs of C. delegorguei are not easy to distinguish from
those of the Rain-Quail, though, on the whole, the spots are
smaller and more numerous. The newly-hatched chicks are
slightly darker in colour than those of C. coromandelica but
otherwise similar.
The call-note of the Harlequin Quail is much like that of
the Rain-Quail but less loud and consisting of three notes
instead of two.
Cotumix pectoralis (fig. VI.). The Australian Stubble
Quail is very common in Eastern and South- Eastern Australia
and Tasmania. It is slightly larger than the other members of
this genus, with the exception of the extinct New Zealand Quail.
It is rarely imported alive into this country, and I can find no
published record of its having been bred here. A pair have
spent the past summer in my aviary, where the female has reared
a brood of seven.
In May the hen commenced to lay, the nest consisting of
a few pieces of dry hay beneath a thick clump of grass. Eleven
eggs were laid, but she made no attempt to sit, probably being
disturbed by the other quails in the same enclosure. On the 15th
of June I discovered another nest, carefully concealed beneath
thick grass, and on the 19th of that month she commenced to sit
on ten eggs. She sat beautifully and hatched off a brood of
seven on July 7th, incubation having been completed in eighteen
days. The chicks were exactly like young Rain-Quails except
for their slightly larger size. They were easily reared, though
one was found dead, with its skull broken, probably through
flying against the wire roof, when about three parts grown.
The young males commenced to show black streaks on the
breast when five weeks old, and were in adult plumage when
about eight weeks old.
The call-note of the male C. pectoralis during the breeding
season sounds like &amp;quot; chucaloi.&amp;quot;
Cotumix novce-zealandice. The New Zealand Quail is not
shown on the plate, as there was no room for a seventh figure,
and a bird that is said by the best authorities to be extinct is of
little interest to aviculturists. It was slightly larger than C.

pectoralis and considerably darker in colour, especially on the
underparts.
At one time, and that not so very long ago, this fine quail
was very abundant in New Zealand, especially in the South
Island, but with the advent of settlers with their marauding
domestic animals, their guns and their bush fires, the quail
commenced to vanish, and when it became noised abroad that it
was becoming rare, the collector, as is his wont, stepped in to
finish the work of extermination, and we are told that a single
skin of a female was sold, within recent years, for seventy-five
pounds.
If only a few pairs of the quails had been taken alive the
species could have been kept going by breeding it in captivity.
There is little doubt that it would have bred in captivity as
readily as the other species of the genus, and probably two broods
a year, of from five to ten birds each could have been reared from
each pair kept.

To keep quails of the group we are now considering
successfully they must have a fairly large run which is well
turfed and in which cover is provided by low bushes or bundles
of brushwood. Part of their enclosure should also be roofed
over and sanded, so as to provide a place for dusting and scratch-
ing. My own aviary, in which no less than three species of
Cotumix have lived together and reared broods during the past
summer measures about 42 feet by 21 feet, and is turfed and
planted with various trees and shrubs and has a pond in the
centre, and the birds have access to a dry well-lighted shed.
The aviary is tenanted by many birds, including Ground Doves
(Geophaps), besides the quails and two species of Turnix. It is
therefore not necessary that each pair of quails, in order to breed
successfully, should have a place to themselves.
As the nesting season approaches the males are apt to
drive one another about, but no serious battles are likely to take
place and, in the case of the three species which I have had
under observation during the past summer, no cross-breeding

has taken place as I feared it might with such closely allied
forms as C. coromandelica and C. delegorg7iei. In the spring the
call-note of the males is ve^ frequently heard, the shrill double
note of the Rain-Quail being audible at a considerable distance.
The female generally selects for a nesting-spot a thick
clump of grass, under which she draws together a few blades of
dry grass, the growing blades being carefully arranged over her
back so as to render her invisible from above when on her nest.
The clutch varies somewhat with the species, six being the
lowest number and thirteen about the highest for a single bird.
The eggs are laid daily until the clutch is complete when, pro-
viding the surroundings are to the birds liking, and she is not
disturbed in any way, incubation commences. At this time the
male deserts the female entirely and seeks another mate, so that,
if the enclosure is sufficiently large, it is well to have two females
to each male. If however there is no other female present it is
advisable to remove the male as soon as incubation commences,
otherwise he may worry the hen and cause her to desert her nest.
A note should be made of the date on which incubation
commences so as to be able to calculate the date of hatching.
Incubation varies from sixteen to eighteen or nineteen days in
the case of Coturnix, and probably depends slightly upon the
temperature of the weather.
A critical time arrives when the hen leaves the nest with
her brood. If she should get frightened she may run some dis-
tance, calling her chicks which will do their best to follow her,
though some may be too weak to do so and promptly die from
cold. My own plan, which has worked most successfully, is to
confine the hen and her brood in a small run by themselves for
at least the first fortnight. The runs I use are about six feet long
by four feet wide, about twelve or eighteen inches high, boarded at
the sides and wired over the top, and with one end made to open
to facilitate the often difficult task of driving the birds in. Part
of the top is made to open for feeding. This run is placed upon
a flat piece of ground on which is plenty of good grass, and care
has to be taken that no space is left anywhere below the sides
through which a chick could squeeze. Over part of the top
brushwood is placed as a shelter. The hen and her chicks are

then carefully and gently driven towards this run, and when
once in they may be considered perfectly safe from harm and
quite easy to rear. In fact I cannot remember ever losing a
young bird when once I had them safely confined thus. There
is no fear of them being disturbed or robbed of their food by
other birds, and there is no chance of their wandering from their
mother or she from them and their not being able to get to one
another again.
There is nothing better for young quails than living ants&apos;
cocoons, and the aviculturist who lives right in the country,
where he can procure and supply his birds with an ants&apos; nest a
day is much to be envied by his less fortunate brethren. When
possible I procure ants&apos; nests for my young quails, filling large
biscuit-tins with them, earth and all, and tip a little of this
mixture of earth, ants, and their cocoons, into the run twice a
day. Besides this they are regularly fed twice a day with soft
food consisting of finely - powdered hard - boiled egg, bread -
crumbs, preserved ants&apos; cocoons and fine crissel, the last two
ingredients having been previously soaked. The young quails
may be reared on the soft food and seed alone, but they should
certainly have living animal food if this can be procured,
especially after the first four or five days, when the growth of
their feathers is very rapid. I have found small gentles most
useful when ants&apos; cocoons were unprocurable, but it is most
essential that these should have been kept for two or three days
at least in dry sand before being given to the birds in order that
they may be thoroughly clean. After the first week I add green
food to the soft -food mixture in the form of finely - chopped
chickweed or young grass.
Of course seed must be supplied for the mother, and the
young birds will partake of this after the first week if not before.
Fine Indian millet is very useful for young quails, and they will
eat a good deal of this after the first week of their existauce.
When a fortnight old the brood may be let out with their
mother into the aviary again, but if there are other quails nest-
ing there, or it is desired that the mother of the chicks should
have a second brood, it is best to wait until the young birds are
three weeks old and then let the mother go back into the en-

closure in which she had her first brood and leave the chicks in
the run another week by themselves, then transferring them to a
separate aviary or larger run. If they should be allowed with
the nesting quails they would most probably disturb these or be
driven about and perhaps killed by the adult males. It is advis-
able to move the run on to fresh ground at least once during the
time it is occupied by the brood.
Quails, whether young or old, have a habit, especially at
night-time, of springing into the air, and captive specimens
often injure themselves severely by dashing against the wire-
netting forming the roof of their enclosure. It is therefore an
excellent plan to cut the flight-feathers of one wing or even to
pinion the birds when young to prevent this.
All of the species of Cotnrnix are quite hardy providing
they have access to a dry place in winter.

Returning home lately after some years spent in Uruguay
I brought with me a couple of these beautiful Jays, which, as far
as I can gather, have been but little, if at all, imported before and
do not seem to be known to the dealers. My surroundings out
there were not such as to make it very easy to do much in the
way of aviculture, but the innate love of keeping some sort of
&amp;quot; bichos,&amp;quot; and particularly birds, had to have its outlet and, in
spite of difficulties and the &amp;quot; slackness&amp;quot; after business hours that
a warm climate tends to produce, it was not long before I had a
small, miscellaneous collection together in a sort of glorified
fowl-run, divided into three compartments. There I kept, or
keep, for I expect they will most of them still be there when I
return in December, some of the common Tinanious and some
&amp;quot;martineta&amp;quot; Tinanious, known usually by the names of &amp;quot; perdiz &amp;quot;

34 Mr. H. C. Martin,
almost wholty of a glossy purple black, the name of which I do
not know, though it is locally called &amp;quot; bandurria,&amp;quot; the very com-
mon &amp;quot; tero-tero,&amp;quot; or Spur-winged Plover, which I was soon glad
to part with as he is much too noisy a customer for a confined
space, though a most beautiful and elegant bird, some pretty
wild duck, some pigeons — there are four kinds in my particular
district — several pairs of &amp;quot; boyeros,&amp;quot; or black Hanguests, I be-
lieve, little slim-bodied birds of charming habits though sombre
in their garb of black, an &amp;quot; ornero &amp;quot; or Oven-bird — a most in-
teresting species about which I ma}&apos;&apos; be one da)&apos; able to send some
special notes — and sundry other small fry. Worth mentioning
too, though not an &amp;quot; avis,&amp;quot; was a coypu (so called by the natural
history books, though in his native country he is always &amp;quot; nutria,&amp;quot;
the name by which his soft warm pelt is known in the fur trade) :
he shared the Herons&apos; quarters, and having been caught quite
small, was for some time a most pleasing and comical pet, delight-
ing to be rolled over, stroked and tickled, and diving and playing
in his tank like a miniature Zoo. sea lion. As he grew larger
however his temper became unreliable and he was at times very
savage, not to say dangerous, for a bite from the chisel-like
teeth of a water rat as big as a fox terrier is no laughing matter.
My first favourites however were the &amp;quot; urracas &amp;quot; and some
White-capped Tanagers &amp;quot; Cardinal imperial,&amp;quot; very lovely birds,
tame and gentle, but which I was unhappily never able to keep
for long even in their own climate, though natives have assured
me that they are quite hardy and will live well on scalded maize-
meal with a little shredded cooked meat and plenty of green food.
I was not able to give my birds much attention personally, but
I had them supplied with a rather more liberal diet, including
fruit. However, I lost them all, apparently by wasting, while I
noticed that the moult was very protracted and imperfect. If I
try again I shall keep them alone in a large cage and try to dis-
cover what it is they need.
To come back however to the &amp;quot; urracas&amp;quot; : one of these I
obtained as a week-old nestling and it has become about the
most ridiculously tame bird I have ever seen : I thought in fact
that it never would learn to feed itself as, for a long time, though
fully grown and feathered, it used to starve rather than do so,

and even now, though about a year old, when hungry will stand
with shuffling wings and baby voice to have tit-bits put down its
throat. The other wild-caught bird is also tame and will take
food from the fingers in the aviary, but it always remains a little
shy and cautious and will not allow itself to be touched, though
nothing pleases the other better than to be scratched and tickled,
especially with a twig or straw, and he will raise his feathers,
stretch his neck and close his eyes in a most laughable way,
thoroughly enjoying a dry shampoo.
I unfortunately omitted to take notes of the young bird&apos;s
nestling plumage, which differed markedly from that of the
adult : after one moult he still shows some points of difference
from this latter, viz., that his eyes are brown, though I now
observe that they are gradually changing to the clear, bright
yellow of the other birds ; the inside of his mouth too was flesh-
coloured, but is gradually becoming black like that of the other,
and I have remarked that the soft thick plumage of the breast
and vent, practically pure white in the old bird after his moult,
was in the young one, right up to the roots of the plumes, of a
light creamy yellow : these feathers are, however, so soft and
delicate that the}&apos; get soiled with the greatest ease, and both birds
have made themselves so dirty through bathing and afterwards
hopping about on the earth floor of the place where I am at
present obliged to keep them, that one can no longer distinguish
any such difference. I believe, however, that this part of the
plumage, cream-coloured in the 3 r oung bird, becomes throughout
gradually lighter with age, though in the wild state even I should
think it is very liable to be soiled merely by contact with branches
and so on.
They are otherwise very handsome, boldh&apos;-coloured birds,
considerabty larger than the Brazilian Blue-bearded Jay, described
by Dr. Butler in the magazine for May 1903 : the back, wings and
tail, with the exception of a white bar at the end of the latter,
are of a deep rich blue which glistens very handsomely in the
sunlight : the feathers of the neck and head are of a velvety
black and extend to form a semi-circular cravat across the breast
while, on the back of the head, they puff out, as it were, into a
curious rounded crest like half a black velvet &amp;quot; pom-pom,&amp;quot; as I

$6 Mr. H. C. Martin,
believe the ladies call it, from beneath which falls away a patch
of light lilac-blue feathers, making a very sudden contrast above
and blending below into the dark blue of the back. The little
brilliant blue eye-patches and darker purplish blue patches at the
base of the lower mandible are disposed in almost the same way
as in the Blue-bearded Jay above-mentioned. The rounded
crest gives the bird a very quaint appearance at first sight and I
am unacquainted with ai^ other passerine bird which has a
similar one, most crests rising rather from the front of the head :
it may perhaps be compared with that of the Tufted Duck on
a small scale.
The &amp;quot; urraca &amp;quot; in his wild state is rather a shy bird, though
at the same time in one way a bold one, the natives saying that
he can be caught in the simplest of traps and that he frequently
comes down after a &amp;quot;carneada&amp;quot; (killing of an animal by the
cattle-men for food out in the &amp;quot; camp &amp;quot;) to try and snatch a tit-
bit for himself. But down in the thick and shady &amp;quot;monte&amp;quot; or
woods by the riverside which he haunts — I have never seen him
elsewhere and even there he is a scarce bird — one seldom sees
him clearly but merely hears a ventriloquial &amp;quot;craw,&amp;quot; and may
just detect a flash of blue and white passing through the dark
and creeper-hung trees. Of his nesting habits I can say little as
I have never actually found the nest, but believe it to be very
like that of our English Jay. I have remarked that the birds
are very fond of breaking twigs or sticks into short pieces which
they do with a dexterous twist of the head, aided perhaps by a
previous hammering with their powerful beaks. There are birds&apos;
nests galore to be found in the &amp;quot; camp,&amp;quot; and I was much struck
at first by the numerous large ones built of sticks, such as those
of the &amp;quot; lenatero&amp;quot; (wood-gatherer) and of the little Green Conure,
seemingly so exposed and accessible : but if one tries to get at
them one soon finds that it is not so easy as it looks : the small
hardwood trees are full of thorns and generally so bristly as to be
almost unclimbable, even if large enough for that, while the
nests themselves are for the most part built of thorny sticks
packed together with such strength that it is a difficult matter to
break or remove them.
Nor can I well describe the voice of the &amp;quot;urraca&amp;quot; ; he has

so many and such varied calls. The old birds will come up to the
wires and call, chatter, and whisper in the most curious way,
bowing and jerking himself about and evidently doing his
best to talk and be sociable. Both have several loud and ringing
call notes, one almost like the bark of a puppy which they
generally utter when alarmed or surprised : they are said to learn
to talk well which I can quite believe, for they undoubtedly
mimic various sounds, and the young one can whistle like any
parrot. As pets I know of no more interesting or desirable
birds ; they are ver)&apos; pretty, tame and hardy and almost as intelli-
gent as dogs. A piece of biscuit or a nut tossed to them will be
very cleverly caught, sometimes in mid-air, and every new object
is thoroughly investigated, being gripped between the feet, just
in the manner shown in Mr. Gronvold&apos;s illustration of the Blue-
bearded Jays, to be hammered by the powerful bill, with which
they will ver} r soon split a lead pencil, for example, into splinters.
They seem to have all the curiosity and love of bright objects of
the Crow tribe, and one particularly noticeable habit is that of
concealing pieces of food, especially nuts or fruit stones, in some
crevice or on the ground, hammering it home and then piling up
quite large stones, lumps of earth and sticks above it. — I have seen
them lift and fly away with so heavy an object as an almost entire
hard-boiled egg, though their flight is by no means powerful. —
They have a quaint way of not appearing satisfied with this
burying operation the first time, undoing all their work and
repeating the whole business in some other corner, and I believe
they never forget where they have hidden something. Another
trick they have is that of pouching their food in the front of the
throat or bottom of the mouth and carrying it about in this way
for quite a long time, until they select a hiding place for it or
finally swallow it. The two seem much attached to one another
and pay each other many little attentions, but I am unable to say
whether the}&apos; are a true pair ; if they are, and giyeu a very roomy
home and suitable treatment (to keep them or similar birds in a
cage of small dimensions is to my mind a cruelty, apart from
which it gives one no opportunity of observing their habits
properly) I feel sure they would breed easily in this country, but
they should not be subjected out-of-doors to the trials of our

38 Mr. H. C. Martin,
long, damp, foggy winter. These two I have given to another of
our members, but shall certainly try to get a couple more to keep
when I return, for I know no species I can more strongly recom-
mend to bird lovers, more perhaps as a pet than from the strictly
avicultural point of view.
As to feeding, I think what one would give to an ordinary
.English Jay or Magpie is all sufficient : a little meat, for prefer-
ence cooked, hard-boiled egg and biscuit, varied with an occasional
chicken bone, some sweet cake, fruit or nuts, of which latter they
are very fond, and a few mealworms or insects when obtainable,
seem to suit them well, though they eat but little for their size.
They revel in a good splash and should be allowed a good large
bath pretty often.
In an aviary or very large cage I should feel inclined to
fix up for them one of those large wire flower-baskets, or else
some sort of box, like a small dog-kennel with a wire-work
bottom and a perch inside, as basis for a possible nest.
Parts of Uruguay abound in beautiful and interesting
birds, very many of which I feel sure have never reached Eng-
land except as skins. One is struck at first by their greater
tameness in the wild state, as compared with our native species,
but to obtain them alive is not an easy matter, the professional
bird-catcher being out there a scarce individual, while the average
native peon fails quite to understand why a mutilated corpse or
severely injured bird is not a desirable acquisition to the erratic
&amp;quot; ingles.&amp;quot; However, far distant be the day when the professional
catcher may become a common object of the country.
In conclusion, a few words as to bringing birds home from
foreign countries, though what I am about to say is nothing new
to most aviculturists. Insist upon a strong, sufficiently large and
airy cage of the box pattern, open only in front. (Oh, the martyr-
dom that I have seen hundreds of unhappy birds subjected to on
board ship, throughbad caging, over-crowding, and the appalling
ignorance of their owners, who cannot make out why one in ten
often cannot survive a three-weeks&apos; passage.) Let your cage be
made with small meshed wire even for the largest birds — this to
defeat as far as possible the assaults of those strange people who
think that all living things were made for them to poke at, as

well as of ship&apos;s cats, rats, and other vermin — and of a form to
provide shelter from sun and salt water, rain and wind : such
cage to have a couple of stout battens nailed on underneath to pre-
vent it from standing in the wet, and to have the food and water
tins in front ; if they are placed at the side and other packages are
placed against them, the butcher, who is generally no naturalist
and, on a liner, perhaps a rather hard- worked person, will find it
too much trouble to move these latter and your birds will only get
fresh water and clean tins &amp;quot;sometimes.&amp;quot; I have also found it
well to have a piece of canvas to roll down the front for occa-
sional protection. Then keep a good eye on your birds youiself
and go and see them once, if not twice or thrice, a day ; but
above all, at least so my experience has taught me, be diplomatic
and cheerful with Mr. Butcher, for liners do not like live stock
and he knows it very well, so that even the prospect of a generous
tip — which is more or less obligatory in any case — has not always
the desired effect. You must not be fussy with him or expect
him to know that bird-seed is not the proper nourishment for
Plovers or Bien-te-veos (sulphury tyrant, I believe) : a cheery
good morning and an occasional cigar will effect much more.
Hardy and easy to feed as they are I doubt whether I should
have got my Jays home safely from Buenos Aires without all
these precautions, through the sheer ignorance and indifference
one meets with.
The best way, if one cannot accompany one&apos;s birds, is 110
doubt to ship by some of the faster regular cargo boats, and
lucky are you if you can arrange for some officer or other in-
telligent and interested person on board to take care of them for
you. As far as possible, too, always ship a supply of the most
suitable food you can.
For anyone taking a short trip, say to Madeira or the
Canaries, and thinking of bringing birds home, I should recom-
mend taking a special box-cage with one&apos;s luggage, making it to
pack in sections, and if one thought of bringing back soft-billed
birds one would do well also to provide a tin or two of some
special food and perhaps a supply of ants&apos; eggs, so-called.

[Third Notice).
By Dr. Albert Gunther, Hon. M. Avic. Soc.
The same pair of Shrikes, whose breeding operations were
reported in the Avicultural Magazine for 1904 and 1905, have
nested again in their aviary in the present year.
Almost to the day (April 24th) the short period of migra-
tory unrest commenced, and was particularly troublesome in the
male bird ; even in the day-time he seemed terrified when I
approached his cage ; the female did not show any signs of
seasonal excitement.
After they had been moved into their aviary, it took them
some time to settle quietly in their summer quarters ; they
behaved exactly as last year. The cold weather which con-
tinued nearly through the whole of May, repressed their re-
productive instincts and the male attended at this period to his
nesting operations in the most perfunctory manner, merely pre-
paring a layer of moss at the bottom of last year&apos;s nesting basket.
The nest was finally completed at the end of June and the first
egg laid on the 30th of that month. The clutch consisted of
three eggs only. They were unusually brightly coloured, one
being spotted all over and so different from the others that a
collector might have been excused for supposing it to be a
Cuckoo&apos;s egg. Only one young was hatched which in due time
has grown into a strong bird, and although independent for its
food, is still occasionally fed by its father (September 30).
The young reared last year have proved to be a male and
female, and if I am right in thinking that the one of the present
year is a female, the proportion of the sexes of the young of this
pair of Shrikes is, so far, exactly alike.

By C. Castu?-Sw)Ane.
I first made the aquaintance of the pretty and graceful
Senegal Doves in June of last year; they soon made themselves
at home in the aviary set apart for the doves, and started to make
a fragile nest of a few twigs and hay, it really could not be called
a nest as it was so flimsy, and looked so like coming down with
every gust of wind, that I quite expected to see the eggs broken
when I went in of a morning; however the birds seem proud of
accomplishing such a nest. The eggs were laid on the 6th and
7th of August : of course they chose the most exposed spot
possible, and after a few days, when everything was going on
nicely, an awful storm of rain which lasted for two or three days
came on, luckily a slight shower came first as if to warn me what
to expect, so a piece of matting was placed over the top of the
aviary and so protected the nest. Contrary to expectations, the
young were hatched, and fine big birds they were, the parents
being very attentive to them ; but one morning, without any
warning, they were both found dead in the nest. The bird had
not deserted them, as she was sitting on the nest that night.
About this time I went away, and heard nothing more till one
morning I received a letter stating that they had nested again,,
the eggs being laid on the 18th and 19th of August, and hatched
out on September 2nd. The young grew and prospered and, at
the time of writing, are flying about in the aviary. When these
doves were nesting they were rather spiteful to the others, and
when they left the nest for food they would fly all round the
aviary making darts at each occupant as if for the fun of the
thing.
About the same time I heard that the Painted Doves had
laid on the 16th and 17th of August and hatched out on August
31st. I was rather excited, thinking that this might be a rare
species, so I wrote to Mr. Seth-Smith saying that I was away and
asking if he could tell me what it was, and he very kindly told
me it was the White-winged Zenaida Dove (Melopelia leucoptera).
This dove also built a very fragile nest, choosing an open spot.
Some time ago I bought some basket nests and put tkem-iu_the- /

most suitable places, as I thought, but soon found the birds pre-
ferred to choose their own spot for a nest, as not one ot the
baskets was used. I never take any precautions as to the young
birds falling out of their nests as there never appeared to be any
need for it. The only time that I did have nestlings die was
when I handled them, and nothing would then prevent them
from falling out, and although I put them back, in the morning
they were found dead.
I have bred in the same aviary the Australian Crested
Dove (Ocj&apos;phaps lophotes), the White-fronted Dove {Leptoplila

FOOD FOR NIGHTINGALES AND OTHER DELICATE
INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Astxey, M.A.
May I be allowed to assist in digging up some of the truth
with regard to the most satisfactory food for nightingales, etc.?
During an automobile tour in Umbria and Tuscany last spring-
time I purchased two of these birds. One at Arezzo at the
commencement of the tour ; the other at Siena at the finish
thereof.
My Arezzo bird — the native town of Petrarca — sang beau-
tifully whenever and wherever the motor-car came to a standstill
— in hotels strange to him, at railway stations when the motor-
car was no longer with us — and even in the motor-car before we
actually started for a day&apos;s journey.
It was through purchasing the Sienese bird that I obtained
the most valuable tips as to food. I had gone to a small bird-
shop (oh ! how dirty and smelly it was) to buy some mealworms,
telling the man that I wanted them for a Nightingale, upon
which he asked me whether I should like another one. At first

I said &amp;quot; no,&amp;quot; but on his telling me that it belonged to a shoe-
maker who would be glad to part with it because it sang so
loudl)&apos;, I consented to be conducted to view it. It was evidently
a young bird like the Arezzo Nightingale : that is — as the owner
indeed assured me — a bird of the previous year. I heard him
singing as I walked down the street, for the cage in which he
lived was hanging outside. ,
Like the one already purchased, this bird was extremely
tame, pecking at the fingers of his owner, and I could not resist
buying him for 30 lire.
Upon asking the shoemaker what he gave his bird to eat r
he answered as follows : Fresh heart (no meat but heart, be it
heart of bullock, chicken or any other heart) chopped extremely
small and mixed well up with flour of Indian corn. Then add
some &amp;quot; bachi de seta&amp;quot; [silk worm cocoons] finely powdered, and
mix altogether. Chop finely some radish leaves, and mix in
thoroughly. To this may be added a little grated cheese, and
some olives, which must be uusalted. They are dry olives, and
must be soaked in water, and then chopped up. This then is
what I give my Nightingales to eat, adding also some pieces of
grape, elder berries, apple and other fruits.
I feed a Blue-winged Siva, a White-capped Himalayan
Redstart and a Shama on the same. I give them the mixture
twice a day, making it all up in the morning, but putting aside
some part of it [in a refrigerator if the weather is hot] and giving
the birds their second course during the afternoon.
I suppose one could import to England dried olives
(uusalted) and also a sack of the dried cocoons which are put
aside after the silk has been wound off them, Grilli, 100 Via
Ghibellina, Florence — a bird dealer — would supply them. Un-
fortunately these cocoons have rather a strong odour.
The above recipe is undoubtedly a good one, for if not
how could Nightingales thrive as I found them thriving when I
bought them, in filthy cages, with unclean drinking water, and
living by day in a draughty street, and by night in extremely
stuffy shops ?

By Mrs. Johnstone.
An interesting account of the importation of these Lori-
keets, by Mr. Walter Goodfellow, was published in the January
number of this magazine, and makes a description of these birds
and their native home unnecessary, so I must take up their Life
Story from the time they reached my hands.
Three birds reached me alive — a fourth reached England
but died at the Docks — one of the three looked like dying, but
after twenty-four hours care and warmth, quite recovered. They
were turned into their new quarters about November in last year
and lived in perfect peace and friendship until February, when
signs of a break up of the happy party were to be noticed. Two
of the birds kept much together, roosted together, and together
combined in making the life of the third bird a burden and
misery. She — for it turned out to be a female — was chased,
pecked, and not allowed to feed, until fearing fatal results, she
was moved into the next aviary, and so the pair had the place to
themselves.
The aviary measures 10 ft. square by 8 ft. high, with a
small outside flight, the inside aviary has several fir boughs
nailed up, the outside a few perches, but no growing trees.
Amongst the inside perches a cocoa nut husk was fixed, and on
the wall one or two nesting boxes of different patterns. The
pair of Lorikeets billed and cooed, otherwise made funny little
twittering sounds, and played like kittens, or as only Lories and
Lorikeets can do. The cock fed the hen and the pair roosted
together in the cocoa nut husk, out of which they had scratched
most of the fibre. This went on for about three weeks, when a
change was noticeable in the behaviour of the cock. This fickle
fellow now spent much of his time talking to the odd Lorikeet
in the next division, the very bird he had so cruelly ill used a
few weeks previously. He and she were always to be seen
chattering, scrambling up and down the wires, and generally
disporting themselves like two sad and separated lovers ; the
poor little deserted hen sitting inside the aviary looking the

picture of misery. Once more the three were allowed together,
but this time the deserted hen had quickly to be captured, as she
had had her tail pulled out and been almost scalped by the new
wife and her fickle mate.
These birds now took possession of a small wooden box,
measuring about 7 in. by 10 in. high, and a cocoa nut husk
cemented at the bottom. The hen almost at once commenced to
sit, or rather they both did, for the cock spent nearly as much
time in the box as the hen, always roosting in it together and he
feeding the hen several times a day on the nest.
Three weeks passed, and at last I fancied I heard more than
one sound when the feeding took place, the hen rarely appeared
and I made sure there were youngsters. At last, as the hen
appeared to be neglecting the babies, I took courage and peered
into the box, the old birds solemnly looked on and showed no
annoyance. To my great disappointment there was nothing, not
an egg, or even an egg shell, and to this day I cannot imagine
why this farce was carried through, it was such a ridiculous
waste of time and energy and so annoying to their owner.
About three weeks after this the hen commenced to sit
again, but I took very little interest in her affairs, as I quite
believed she was going to play this little game again. The cock
fed her industriously and as before roosted and spent much time
in the nest box, which considering the weather — 86 deg. in the
shade — must have been warm work. I still kept count of dates
in case of success, and just three weeks after the hen disappeared
little squeaks and sounds of young birds proceeded from the nest
box. I was sceptical at first, but as the sounds got stronger I
took advantage of the old birds&apos; absence and once more examined
the nesting box. The old birds flew in at once with cries of rage
and fright, but I had time to see two little bare red bodies with
large beaks — baby Lorikeets about a week old !
And now, day by day, the sounds grew louder from the
box, the calls for food stronger but at longer intervals. The old
birds fed largely on spray millet and sweetened bread and milk ;
half an orange was also consumed daily.
Just a calendar month after the young ones were first
heard in the box, they appeared perfectly fledged, in faultless

feather, exactly like the old birds, with the following ex-
ceptions : the beaks are black, a fine white ring of skin is
noticeable round the eye, the edges of the flight features in the
wings are edged with white — they are slightly smaller. The
maroon marking from the eye to eye is not so clearly defined at
the back of the head, but starts in a wide band from the eyes.
&amp;quot;Them there Johnstonians,&amp;quot; as my bird boy gravely calls
them, are a most devoted family, the old birds&apos; fondness is pretty
to watch. As a rule they roost alternately, first the old cock,
then a young bird, then the hen, then a young bird — packed
close together the}&apos; chatter and twitter and preen each others&apos;
feathers.
And now I discovered the only point in which these birds
differ in their nesting from other Lorikeets. In taking down the
nesting box and cocoa nut husk, for the autumn cleaning, I was
surprised to find in each a rough nest. The little ends and twigs
of fir, tiny scraps with the needles attached had been carried into
the box, the cocoa nut fibre had been scratched up and quite a
nest constructed. The cocoa nut husk had been similarly treated,
several pieces of twig and fir had been carried in, in fact both the
box and husks were half full of scraps and bits of twig and fibre.
In conclusion, may I add, that these birds are absolutely
hardy ; since I have had them they have been perfectly well, and
all through last winter were out on every passable day, scramb-
ling and playing, when most Lories and Lorikeets would have
looked puffy and miserable. This is not of course surprising, as
they come from a very high altitude, but it is refreshing to find a
hardy beautiful creature, and one as ready to reproduce its
species in captivity.

<bodyText confidence="0.998013875" page_id="33228999"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
In the December (1905) number of this journal we had
occasion to notice a delightful book for young people entitled
&amp;quot;The Birds and their Story,&amp;quot; by Mr. R. B. Lodge, of which the
volume now before us is a companion. As may be gathered
from the title the author deals with the many wonders of Natural
History that are revealed at every season of the year, and in
every hedgerow and pond, to those who have eyes to see them.
Mr. Lodge is a naturalist who knows well how to observe nature
and to teach his readers how to do so also.
Many very charming little etchings are inserted in the
margin of the pages, and there are no less than eight full page
coloured plates by the author&apos;s brother, Mr. George Lodge, who
is perhaps second to none as a naturalist artist.
We can very strongly recommend Mr. Lodge&apos;s book to
those who wish to give their children and young friends a book
that will interest and instruct them in nature studv.

Mr. Frank Finn is well known to our members as an
authority on Indian Birds, and a new book on this subject from
his pen will be welcomed by many. The book is written chiefly
for Anglo-Indians, and the birds dealt with are those which are
commonly to be met with in the gardens of India ; but as these
are sometimes brought home to this country, where some of
them, such as the Dhyal or the Shama, make very delightful
aviary inmates, the book is of great interest to aviculturists
generally.
At the end the author deals with many of the better known
aviary birds belonging to other countries, and which are often to
be seen in the Calcutta markets or in private aviaries.
A chapter dealing with classification is written in such a
way that it can be easily understood by every one ; and seven
black and white plates add to the usefulness of the volume.

given two pairs of Necklace Doves, the Hon. Gerald Lascelles has promised
a pair of Palm Doves and, as previously announced, Sir William Ingram, Bt,
six Bronzewing Pigeons.
The species which I believe would be most likely to succeed is the
Australian Crested Dove. This is an exceedingh* graceful and beautiful
bird, hardy and well able to take care of itself, and it is proposed, if the birds
are to be had, to spend almost all of the sum subscribed on the purchase of
examples of this species. The Bronzewing Pigeon would also be a good
one for our purpose, and possibly some of these may also be purchased, but
I think the Crested Dove {Ocyphaps lophotes) is the most suitable species.
Dr. Drewitt is also of this opinion, for he writes me as follows con-
cerning this bird: &amp;quot;This bird seems to have all the necessary qualifications,
being hardy, beautiful and harmless. It bred freely in the aviaries of the
late Lord Lilford ; and a pair I once had seemed quite happy even in a cage
in London.
&amp;quot; The usual argument against acclimatization cannot be applied to it.
Rabbits, Starlings, Sparrows, and Thrushes were known to be harmful long
before they were introduced into our Colonies. There can be little danger
of the graceful little dove competing with the Woodpigeou, if it did no
great harm would be done.
&amp;quot; Of course the first of them will share the pioneers&apos; fate. Some will
be &amp;quot; obtained &amp;quot; and stuffed ; some greedily eaten by cats. But others will
survive. May they become the ancestors of a prosperous race.&amp;quot;
Any member who has Crested Doves to sell at a reasonable price, or to
give for the experiment will greatly oblige by communicating with me.
It is proposed to form a small Committee to manage the experiment,
and of course a full statement as to how the money has been spent will be
published in due course. D. Skth-Smith.

Correspondence. Notes, etc. 49
Sir, — I have just received my copy of the Avicultural Magazine for
September and have read with horror, not to say disgust, the suggestion to
turn out a number of Australian Crested or Bronze -wing Pigeons in
Regent&apos;s Park. Are we dissatisfied with our own avifauna that we should try
and establish birds beautiful and harmless enough perhaps in their own
country, but which when once started in England might and probably
would completely drive out many interesting species of birds ?
I have been to most civilised and uncivilised countries in the world
and have seen many &amp;quot; introduced &amp;quot; species of birds, that is to say birds
introduced into continents and islands outside of their range, and I have
never yet come across a single instance where this has not done harm to the
original avifauna, and I defy anyone to prove otherwise. Once let a foreign
species of bird or mammal become established, and then, either good-bye to
some interesting original species or, if this does not happen, the &amp;quot;introduced&amp;quot;
species multiplies accordingly and quickly becomes a curse. I need here
only mention a few instances. Mynahs introduced into Fiji, the Sandwich
Islands, and Tahiti are fast outnumbering and destroying many of the
smaller peculiar passerine birds of those islands. Sparrows in Australia
need no comment from me here. The Mongoose in the West Indies is
quickly becoming, or rather has become, an absolute menace to the resident
fauna. The American Opossum [Didelphis marsupialis), perhaps a harm-
less mammal in its own country, has now, owing to its being introduced into
the West India Islands, completely exterminated the Capped Petrel yCEstrelata
Jiesitata) in the two Islands Guadeloupe and Dominica, when and where it
is known to have bred. There is no need to further enlarge upon the
&amp;quot; introduction &amp;quot; follies, and if we in England, one of the few countries in
the world whose avifauna has been kept comparatively pure, and which is
probably one of the most interesting in the world, if we, I say, will not take
warning by the follies of our Colonies, may we, or at least those who intend
to perpetuate this new folly, live to repent it.
Zoological Gardens, Giza, Egypt. Michael J. Nicom,.
[We regret that we cannot agree with Mr. Nicoll. We are very fully
aware of the amount of harm that has been done by ill-considered
acclimatization, and the instances quoted in the above letter were all
ill-considered. In almost ever}&apos; instance prolific species from cool climates
have been introduced into countries where the temperature is warm enough
to admit of a perpetual breeding season. The introduced species moreover
have been more powerful than the native species with the result that the
latter have been overpowered. Had the introducers of the Sparrow,
Rabbit, or Mongoose, or any of those species mentioned by Mr. Nicoll,
stopped for one moment to consider what would be the result of their
experiment the}&apos; could not have failed to see its folly.
With the experiment we propose to try we maintain that no~TTarm
could possibly result. We are introducing species from a warm climate

into a country with a much cooler temperature. Hence their natural
breeding season would be reduced. Moreover the Australian Doves, which
we propose to liberate, are far less robust in constitution than the
indigenous Woodpigeons which at present have the Parks to themselves.
It seems unlikely that they would spread much farther than the London
Parks if indeed they manage to hold their own there for any time, but
even if they ever managed to spread to the surrounding country they
could never do much harm, none in fact compared with the Woodpigeon.
Moreover, being rarities, they would be immediately shot Ity the ubiquitous
collector.
Again the introduction of these Australian Doves could not affect the
records of the occurrences of rare migrants such as the introduction of
foreign Palsearctic birds would be likely to do, for no one would expect
them to have migrated to this country of their own free will. If this were
the case we could understand Mr. Nicoll&apos;s objection. As it is, it is difficult
to do so. As before stated in this Journal, the Crested and Bronzewing
Pigeons have already been liberated and become more or less established at
Woburn. — Ed.].
vSir, — I am afraid the scheme of turning out Bronzewings, etc., will
not answer very well. My own experience has only been with Barbary
Doves, but I found after a few years that (after increasing up to about thirty
in number) the birds gradually decreased till only one was left. They had
perfect liberty, and there is a park close to our garden, so they had plenty of
space and were regularly fed.
I think, if any experiment is made, it seems a pity to do so with such
expensive kinds of doves as Bronzewings and Crested Doves, it would be
wiser to try with Java Doves or Barbary. R. ANDERSON.
[We imagine that the purely wild species would be more likely to
succeed than those which have been domesticated for centuries, such as the
Barbarv Dove and its white form known as the Java Dove. — Ed.]

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Three species, or perhaps two of them should be ranked
only as local races or sub-species, are known of the genus
Lophophaps. They are exceedingly beautiful little Doves, entirely
terrestrial in their habits, running over the ground as rapidly as
Quails, and springing into the air with the same rapid buzzing
flight.
The Plumed Doves inhabit the heated and arid plains of
Australia, where their plumage harmonizes with the reddish
sandy soil, and they love to bask in the tropical heat of the sun&apos;s
rays. They never perch on trees although they delight to sit on
rocks.
The three species or races which comprise this genus
are as follows :
i. Lophophaps plumifera, Gould&apos;s type of the genus, differing
from L. leucogaster, the bird now figured, by its darker
colour and by the absence of the white pectoral band so
conspicuous in L. leucogaster. Habitat: North West
Australia.
2. L. fer?&apos;ugi?iea (Gould), differing from L. plumifera only in
the cinnamon colour of its plumage being of a much
deeper hue. It inhabits Western Australia and perhaps
is merely a local race of L plumifera.
3. L. leucogaster (Gould) figured in the accompanying plate,
inhabits &amp;quot; the whole of Central Australia, the Gulf
District and the interior of Northern and North -Western
Australia.&amp;quot; (North).
It is of the last only of these three forms which, accord-

ing to Mr. North, is a perfectly distinct species, that I have had
any experience, and of which I propose to offer a few brief notes.
In the first place it may be as well to quote from the
writings of those who have met with this bird in its native wilds.
In the Report of the Horn Expedition to Central Australia in 1894,
Mr. Keartland writes: &amp;quot;At Crown Point, on 18th May, Mr. Belt
secured the first pair of these birds. They proved to be adults,
and the female contained a well-developed egg in the oviduct.
Subsequently I obtained them in numbers at Lawrie&apos;s Creek,
Petermann Creek, Hermannburg, and in fact wherever rocks
and water existed, until we reached Crown Point on the return
journey on 26th July. On several occasions they made a welcome
addition to our table, where their beautiful white flesh was much
appreciated. Their love of rocky country has gained for them
the appellation of &apos; Rock Pigeons.&apos; They are strictly ground
birds and never perch 011 trees, but assembled in small com-
panies on the rocky sides of the gorges through which we passed,
where they seemed to enjoy basking in the hot sun. Owing to
their colour they are not easily seen on the red sand and rocks.
They are easily approached, and when disturbed rise with a
4 whirr&apos; like a quail ; but as soon as they are on the wing they
gently glide away, giving a tempting shot. At Stokes&apos; Pass,
Hugh Edgar, one of our camel drivers, found a nest, if such it
might be called, containing two young ones nearly able to fly.
They were entirely brown, but others probably a week older were
found, which had developed the white and black on the throat
and head, which were invisible on the nestlings, as the feathers
had not formed on those parts. The birds lay their eggs on the
ground, generally near a tussock of porcupine grass, and place a
few loose straws around, but in such a careless manner that it
scarcely deserves the name of nest. Subsequently, at Haast&apos;s
Bluff, Dr. Stirling found several nests containing eggs or young
ones. There were never more than two eggs, which are about
one-third smaller than those of Ocyphaps lophotes, and are of a
dull, creamy-white colour, with a rather rough surface and lack-
ing the usual glossy surface of pigeon eggs.&amp;quot;

Zoological Gardens appear to have been a pair purchased on May

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.993550567567567" page_id="33229011"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
belonged to the white-banded form — L leucogaster, and, so far as
I am aware, all that have been imported since (quite a large
consignment was received by a London dealer in 1904, most of
which, I understand, went to America), have belonged to this
species. The pair which reached the Zoological Gardens in 1894
nested in the grass of one of the outer flights of the Western
Aviary in 1905, and hatched and successfully reared two young
birds.
This species was represented in the Zoological Gardens up
to the present year 1906, where it was still labelled as£. plumifera,
a species which has probably never been seen alive in this
country if indeed in Europe.
My experience of L. leucogaster in captivity has been
limited to five specimens, two males and three females, which I
obtained in 1905. At first they were very shy, but they soon
became tame, and then I found that it was impossible to keep
more than one pair together. They are terrible bullies, and a
cock will soon clear the place of every ground bird except the
hen he is mated to. I therefore kept only one pair, the others
going to another member of the Society. Another difficulty with
these birds is that the cock every now and then commences to
chase and bully his own hen. The pair will caress each other
most affectionately for a time, and then the cock will suddenly
turn on the hen and chase her all over the enclosure in which
they are kept. This habit is, of course, by no means conducive
to successful nesting, and so far I have been entirely unsuccessful.
In the spring of the present year (1906) I put this pair into
my largest outdoor aviary, and here I think they would have
succeeded, but before they had been out an hour they commenced
to chase and worry the Quails and Hemipodes to such an extent
that my only course was to confine them in a smaller aviary.
This was a fair-sized place, about equal to one of the smaller
compartments of the Western aviary at the Zoo., and the outer
part was well turfed. They had not been here long before the
lieu laid a pair of eggs in one corner, without any pretence at a
nest, and commenced to sit. No sooner had she commenced
liowever than a thunderstorm with tropical rain caused her to

desert. Since this several clutches of eggs have been laid but no
attempt has been made to incubate.
The display of the male Plumed Dove is very pretty and
frequently performed. He bows to his mate in the most cour-
teous manner, at the same time expanding his tail and wings,
and showing off his wonderful patch of irridescent purple-bronze
to the best advantage. My pair became so tame that the cock
used to run and display to me as I entered the aviary, and then

he would run at me making quite a savage grunting &amp;quot; coo &amp;quot; with
the evident intention of driving me out of the aviary.
These little Doves are fairly hardy and, providing their
aviary is well sheltered and dry, would probably do without
artificial warmth during the winter in this country. Canary and
millet seed seems to be all that they require in the way of food.
They are fond however of plucking off the green seeds of grasses
and other weeds. A lump of rock salt should not be omitted
from the aviary.
A description of this species is unnecessary with Mr.
Gronvold&apos;s beautiful plate before the reader.
The sexes are alike in plumage, the male being perhaps a
shade larger than the female. It is about 8 inches in length.

If anyone wants a charming pet for the garden aviary,
which will be tame with its owner, and gentle to its fellow
captives, and at the same time one which will never give him a
moments&apos; anxiety in time of bad weather, let me recommend the
Pine Grosbeak. I have now kept several for nearly two years,
and know no hardy bird which shows itself better, and is so
lively, without being restless and timid.
Though the aviary is rather a large one, and is secluded
from traffic of persons passing, my birds are extraordinarily
familiar, and I can stand within a yard or two while the
Grosbeaks are busy with the hawthorn sprays, or larch branches,
or whatever delicacy is in season.
I started the summer with three males and a female,
having lost one of each sex in the spring as I will describe later
on. Of these males one had a slightly injured wing, but he was
otherwise sound ; and, like the other males, in fine rosy plumage.
Several Missel-Thrushes&apos; nests were put up in likely
positions, but the Grosbeaks took no particular notice of them.
On the 28th May my man Arthur Moody saw the hen Grosbeak
arranging some twigs in the fork of a yew, in rather an exposed
position, but to some extent screened by the upper branches of
the bush. To his surprise, she took up a small bit of a dry
spruce branch which he tossed on the ground, and carried it up
and laid it with the others, and for some twenty minutes or so
she picked up twig after twig as fast as he threw them down
for her.
The solid foundation of the nest was made altogether in
this way, the male not assisting at all. Possibly the inconvenience
of a slightly stiffened wing prevented him from helping.
Pine roots, and coarse bents were used as a lining, but no
feathers or soft material ; the nest being much like that of the
Hawfinch.
On June 3rd the first egg was laid. On the 6th she had
three eggs and began to sit. On the 20th June a young bird was
hatched in the morning, the other in the evening of the same
day. During incubation one egg was cracked, and was^found

sticking to a branch of the yew. Whether it was accidentally
broken by the hen, or by some other inmate of the aviary, Tits,
Crossbills, or Waxwings, we could not make out ; but no fighting
or quarrelling was noticed. The cock assisted in feeding the
young, but the hen alone incubated.
The hen Grosbeak would come on to the fingers of one&apos;s
hand, and take off the palm the fresh ants&apos; eggs (pupae), small
caterpillars, and sawfly grubs which alone were given at first to
the young. To my great delight I saw her while sitting on the
edge of the nest, take as many of the ant pupae as she could
swallow, from a teaspoon gently held out to her, and after sitting
a few minutes, probably to moisten them, she disgorged them
into the mouths of the half-fledged young.
On the 4th July the young birds left the nest. There was
no further difficulty with them, and they soon began to eat the
parents&apos; food, and became strong on the wing.
At present they closely resemble the female parent (of
course they may both be females) but are rather more green than
she is 011 the face and nape, where she is yellow. Their flanks
and breasts are also slightly paler; but unless they are all
together, it is not easy to distinguish them.
It was strange that with three males to choose from, the
hen bird should have mated with the one with the injured wing.
But though slightly crippled, this bird was clearly master; and
though he did not follow them far, he would, when the nesting
was going on, hunt off all the other birds from the immediate
neighbourhood of the bush.
My Grosbeaks have a variety of small seeds, including
hemp ; and a little sunflower-seed as a treat. Of the last they
are very fond, and I think it was due to giving this too freely
that I lost the two Grosbeaks, and a Crossbill or two, in the
spring. At the time I thought perhaps that the deaths were due
to the birds having nibbled the growing yew shoots (as they
freely do) ; but since the sunflower seed has been reduced, the
birds have kept healthy.
Elder berries, hips and haws, and fresh larch branches,
also slices of apple, are much appreciated, but I think that an
excess of oily seeds is to be carefully avoided.

By J. H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
My pair of Jackal Buzzards Buleo jackal (Daud.) arrived
from the Zoological Gardens in the autumn of 1904 and stood
their first winter in Norfolk in an out-of-doors cage well. Being
supplied with nesting materials early in the following spring, they
in June built themselves a nest but laid no eggs. However in the
spring of 1906 materials being again supplied early and in greater
variety than before, building commenced at the end of February,
and in about a fortnight the nest, which was chiefly composed
of small sticks, was finished, and the Buzzard was sitting on it.
On March 16th the absence of the female for a short time
enabled my man to see that there were two eggs in the nest, one
of which was chipped on April 18th and this had hatched out by
the morning of the 19th. The other egg unfortunately proved
to be rotten. As the eggs are believed to have been laid suc-
cessively on March 14th and 15th, this would give 39 days as the
period of incubation of this Buzzard.
At the age of five days the nestling was covered with
palest grey down, but on the throat, chin, and face the down was
white. On the 16th of May the first feathers were just visible,
on the 19th it was a month old and could stand, and by the 28th
it was two thirds the size of its parents and growing rapidly, red
feathers coming over most of its breast.
By June 5th I think it might have been called full grown,
the upper part of its breast being by that time very dark and the
sides streaked, the eye much greyer than the eyes of its parents
and its legs a paler yellow. On July 4th the eye was assuming a
yellow tint, the bird being in excellent health but still showing
two or three flecks of down which were not yet shed.
At the age of six months (October 24th) all the tinder-
parts were a fairly bright rufous, without any indication of dark
flanks or belly, nor had any of the under feathering those broad
white margins which add so much to the beauty of an adult.
Head and tipper parts brown, tail brown, underside of spread
wing partly white, eyes pale yellow. I have been thus particular
in the description, because the early stages iu the life of this
species do not seem to have been described in detail before.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Astxey, M.A.
A pair of these extremely pretty doves, which I have had
iu an outdoor aviary for three years have reared several young
this season [1906]. They commenced in April and have
continued steadily ever since, and as I write, have a pair of
newly-hatched young. [14th October.] As I have not been in
Italy during the summer months, I cannot record with exactitude
all their failures or successes, but there are representatives of
at any rate three families flying about in good condition and
health. That is, there are three birds in adult plumage and one
in semi-nestling plumage, which birds must represent three
separate nests. In May one bird was successfully reared from
the first nest, its comrade having fallen out when about ten days
old, and been killed.
Both the young birds hatched in April died in the nest
when well feathered. Perhaps the parent birds had not yet
gained sufficient experience iu feeding, for the hen bird was still
brooding her young after life had departed from their bodies.
Between June and October there must have been two
more broods, represented by three birds. The first of these
broods having two, and the second, one young one. So that
altogether there have been at least four broods in seven mouths ;
and I rather believe there was another pair of eggs which came
to nothing. The nest has been always built iu the same place
within a covered box, partly open on one side and entirely open
underneath. A small bunch of heath {Erica) was fixed within,
and on this the Peaceful Doves built a fairly compact nest of hay.
The young when first hatched are covered with a fawn-
coloured down ; but I regret that I cannot describe them more
in detail, as I did not care to disturb the parent bird too much.
When they leave the nest the}&apos; - have a very spotted appear-
ance. The crown, hind neck, upper back, shoulders, greater
wing-coverts and secondaries, have each feather spotted with
cream-buff on the ends, and within this spot there is a bar
(almost a spot) of dark brown. These creamy spots form two

very distinct bars across tne wings, on the secondaries and
greater coverts.
Over the eyes is a line of huffish white, a spot of the same
colour over the ears, and a shorter line under the eyes. The
bluish colour and the pale pink round the eyes and on the breast
of the adult is absent. The general ground colour of the young
birds is a dull mouse brown.
As far as I can see, the white of the feathers in the tail is
much the same as in the parent birds&apos;. The longer feathers of
the secondaries in the wings are somewhat square at the ends,
and are tipped with a creamy spot edged interiorily with a line
of deep blackish-brown.
I do not pretend that this description is an exhaustive
one, and my more particular friends must be content with what
to them will probably be an extremely sketchy description ! if
they are not already acquainted with the Peaceful Dove in its
nestling plumage. I am not aware of the exact period of
incubation, but I believe it to be about thirteen days.
The cooing of these doves is peculiar, composed of high
melodious notes repeated rapidly ; and the male bird lifts his
tail in the air expanding the feathers as he does so, when
courting. As the young birds hatched in June and Jul)&apos; are
now in full plumage, it is evident that they assume it in at least
two to two and a half mouths.

CONURE.
By E. J. Brook.
As I understand that there is some doubt whether the
White -eared Conure has been successfully reared in captivity
on any previous occasion, perhaps my success will not be with-
out interest.
My birds are in a large outdoor aviary with an inner
house, and they share this aviary with a pair of Golden-headed
Conures. The White Ears went to nest in a large natural log,
laying the first egg on the 3rd of August, and commenced to sit

when the second egg was laid. Eight eggs were laid, and
hatched in abont 21 days, producing seven birds which are now
flying iu the aviary. The first young birds left the nest in about
five weeks from hatching.
The young White-Ears differ from the old birds in that
the inner web of the flight feathers and larger wing-coverts is
yellow, and when very young they showed a good deal of yellow
on the back. The old birds are most excellent parents, and at
once go to the assistance of any one of their young that may
seem to be in a difficulty. I may mention that at night the
whole occupants of this aviary, Golden Heads and all, retire into
the same nesting box ; they must be a bit crowded, but there is
no fighting.
[We cannot find any record of previous success with Pyrrhtira
leucotis, but cases in which these birds have nested and even partially reared
young, are not rare, and it is hardly likely that so well-known a species has
never before bred successfully in captivity in this country. Has any
member ever heard of a previous instance in which the young of this
species have been reared? Ed.]

WHAT IS &amp;quot;THE BENGALEE&amp;quot;?

1st. WHAT IS &amp;quot;THE BENGALEE &amp;quot; ?
In the &amp;quot;Avicultural Magazine,&amp;quot; Vol. IV., No. 12 (Oct.
1906) Dr. Arthur G. Butler, in an interesting and valuable article
&amp;quot;On Hybrid Ploceidae,&amp;quot; brings up the question of the Bengalee,
(loc. cit. p. 351) ; he remarks of it :
1st. &amp;quot; Now generally regarded as the domesticated
representative of Uroloncha striata.&amp;quot;
2nd. &amp;quot; If, as seems probable, the Bengalee is only
Uroloncha striata in various domestic guises,&amp;quot;
</reference>
<bodyText confidence="0.975157333333333" page_id="33229019"  page_num="61" year="" vol="">
on &amp;quot;The Bengalee.&amp;quot; 61
and he writes of it in the article under the scientific name of
Uroloncha striata var.
I do not wish to differ from such a good authority as
Dr. Butler, to whom I would like to take this opportunity of
acknowledging my grateful thanks for much useful information
obtained from his writings, but I venture to think that more
knowledge of this common but pleasing little cage - bird is
required before we can settle its exact affinities, and it also
appears to me that it requires a more definite name.
In Dr. Butler&apos;s &amp;quot;Foreign Finches in Captivity,&amp;quot; (1894),
the bird is called :
&amp;quot;The Bengalee, Aidemosyne malabarica x Uroloncha
striata, Linn.,&amp;quot;
and a very beautiful coloured plate by Mr. Frohawk faces page
222, with a picture of each of the three varieties.
In &amp;quot;Foreign Bird Keeping,&amp;quot; Part I., p. 52, Dr. Butler uses
the same names for this bird.

In Cassell&apos;s &amp;quot; Canaries and Cage Birds,&amp;quot; the late Mr.

I am interested to know whether anyone has actually
succeeded in producing &amp;quot; the Bengalee &amp;quot; from typical Uroloncha
striata, or by crossing U. striata with any other species, and also
to what extent the three chief varieties of &amp;quot;the Bengalee&amp;quot; breed
true ?
As regards this second question, Mr. Wiener (loc. cit. p.
386) writes, &amp;quot; It should be stated that in the same nest may be
found pure white and piebalds of various shades,&amp;quot; but he does
not mention the colour of the parent birds. While Miss Emily

Brampton in her excellent account &amp;quot; Bengalese as Cage-Birds,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot; Avic. Mag.&amp;quot; Vol. II., No. 4, (Feb. 1904), pp. 134-135, expressly
states : &amp;quot; By putting together birds of different colours I have
had chocolate and white, fawn and white, and pure white young
ones in the same nest.&amp;quot;
This bird being so easily obtainable, making such a
charming pet, and being essentially an inhabitant of a cage —
(has it ever been found wild ?) — should make an ideal subject for
experimental breeding.
In the &amp;quot; Avic. Mag.&amp;quot; Vol. I., No. 3, (Jan. 1903), p. 112, the
Reviewer writes: &amp;quot;Domestication is also responsible for the
white form of the Java Sparrow, and the white and pied forms
(Bengalese) of the Sharp tailed Finch, Uroloncha striata. We
perfectly agree with Mr. Finn that there is no reason for
supposing the latter birds to be hybrids.&amp;quot;
In the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, Vol. XIIL, by
Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe (1890), I have failed to find this bird, but
one notes that 110 species of Uroloncha or Aidemosyne occurs in
Japan, where most authors seem to state our &amp;quot;Bengalee&amp;quot;
originated ; the nearest geographical approach being Uroloncha
squamicollis Sharpe (loc. cit. p. 359), whose habitat is given as
&amp;quot; China, Formosa, and Hainan.&amp;quot; Neither apparently does any
species of Munia sens, strict, extend nearer to Japan than
Formosa and Hainan (i.e. Munia Jormosa Swinhoe and Mtcnia
topela Swinhoe).
Of course that the energetic Japanese and the cage-bird
loving Chinese should import and breed birds whenever they
have had the chance is most probable, but with other closely
allied Ploceidce nearer at hand, it appears to me to want further
proof before we can accept Uroloncha striata of &amp;quot; Central and
Southern India and Ceylon &amp;quot; as the origin of their domestic
breeds. On the other hand, I (with no access to a general
library) do not know 011 what grounds the statements rest that
our &amp;quot;Bengalee&amp;quot; originated with the Japanese (or Chinese) : it
may have been evolved in India, but that does not appear to me
to be at all probable.
Moreover it must be remembered that our knowledge of
the avifauna of Eastern Asia is by 110 means yet complete :

to be :

2nd. THE APPLICATION OF THE NAME
&amp;quot; BENGALEE.&amp;quot;
Professor Alfred Newton, &amp;quot; Dictionary of Birds,&amp;quot; (1893),
p. 31, writes: &amp;quot;Bengali, the dealers&apos; name for the beautiful
little African bird, Fringilla bengahis of Linnaeus, and some of
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.988228052631579" page_id="33229021"  page_num="63" year="" vol="">
its allies, belonging to the Ploceidts (Weaver-bird), and referred
by later writers to the genus Estrilda, Pytelia or Urtegintkus.
The name originated with Brisson (&amp;quot;Ornithol.&amp;quot; III., p. 203), who
believed these birds came from Bengal.&amp;quot; But as pointed out by
Capt. G. E. Shelley, &amp;quot;Birds of Africa,&amp;quot; Part L, p. 186, &amp;quot;Bengala&amp;quot;
may equal Beuguela in West Africa, and not the Indian province
of Bengal.
There seems to me no doubt that the name &amp;quot; Bengalee &amp;quot;
originally and by right belongs to the Crimson-eared Waxbill, or
Cordou-bleu, called &amp;quot; Le Bengali&amp;quot; by Brisson as long ago as
1760 ! A lovely little bird we have all known as the Eslre/da
phoenicotis of Swainson, but whose scientific name in both
the books on African birds now in progress (Shelley&apos;s and
Reichenow&apos;s) is amended to Urceginthus bengahis.
The word Bengalee, variously spelt, has been used va
various European languages to indicate almost any of the smaller
Weaver-birds, and is still commonly so used in the trade, but
thanks largely to Dr. Butler the term is now generally restricted
by English aviculturists to the bird that forms the subjectof

these notes : and as far as the &amp;quot; English&amp;quot; name is concerned I
trust it will remain so, and that our dainty Crimson-eared friend
will retain his appropriate name of &amp;quot; Cordon - bleu.&amp;quot; If it is
necessary in the case of &amp;quot; scientific names&amp;quot; to bow to the
&amp;quot; priority-at-all-costs &amp;quot; fetish, there is fortunately no need to do
so in the case of vernacular names.
3rd. SUGGESTED NAMES FOR THIS BIRD.
Most aviculturalists, more especially those that have to
carry on animal-business in several different modern languages,
will agree that a Latin or Latinized name is essential, not only
for every species of wild animal, but also for every well marked
variety or race, wild or domesticated ; some years back, when
first dealing with the &amp;quot; Bengalee&amp;quot; of these notes, I could find no
Latin name applicable, — Dr. Butler&apos;s Aidemosyne malabarica x
Uroloncha striata was not only cumbrous but implied a derivation
not generally believed in, I therefore in 1903 coined the name
Munia domeslica.
As regards the first part of this name, the genus Munia
•(1836) in its wider sense may be taken to include the other two
o-enera to which this bird has been assigned, U?vlo?icka (1850)
and Aidemosyne (1861) : the application of domestica seems
obvious.
Therefore until we can ascertain for certain the origin of
this bird, I propose for convenience that it should be called :
The Bengalee, Miinia domestica ;
and the three varieties, as shown in Mr. Frohawk&apos;s plate in Dr.
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.359647333333333" page_id="33229022"  page_num="64" year="" vol="">
Butler&apos;s book mentioned above, may be called :
Brown-and-White Bengalee,
Munia domestica griseomaculata (Russ) ;
Fawn-and- White Bengalee,
Munia domestica flavomaculata (Russ) ;
White Bengalee, Munia domestica alba (Russ).

Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, and I cannot do
better than quote what I wrote to that journal.
The birds were first seen on April 17th (1904) and almost
at once commenced nesting. On the morning of the 19th I
again visited the place and found the two birds swimming apart
from each other. After a short time they met and began to spar
with their bills — 110 doubt a pairing gesture. What I took to
be the female bird then scrambled up on a small islet and dis-
appeared among the reeds. A pair of Coots QFulica atra) were
nesting on the same place, and tried to drive what I took to be
the male bird away. Once they were successful, but after a time
the Grebe became master of the situation and drove the Coots
away. The way he drove off one Coot was distinctly ingenious.
Diving some little distance away, he suddenly came right up
under the Coot and fairly &amp;quot;torpedoed&amp;quot; the Coot out of the
water. The male bird then rested on the water near the islet,
drying and preening its feathers. When it wished to clean its
breast it would turn right over on its back, with one leg sticking
up in the air. The female bird when she landed on the islet did
not stand upright, but dragged herself along on her belly. I did
not revisit the place until May 1st, and found the female sitting
close. The male was swimming near at hand and again drove
some Coots away that came too near the nest. On September
2nd I saw the young birds (two in number) in company with
their parents which were very attentive to them, feeding them on
small fish. On September nth I could only see one young one
with the old birds. On October 30th I only saw the young one,
the old ones had left.
The next year (1905) the Grebes returned to the place on
February 25th. At first I only caught sight of one bird which
was in full breeding plumage. On looking through my field-
glasses I saw it treading water, splashing with its wings, and
spinning round and round like a teetotum, with crest raised to
its full extent. Presently with neck stretched in front of him
(I say &amp;quot;him&amp;quot; for this was the one I took to be the male) he
uttered a hoarse croak, and lay fiat on the water, flapping his
wings vigorously. I saw then the cause of his excitement, for
coming towards him was another Grebe also stretched along the

water in the same strange position as the first. The two met
breast to breast and chattered together and sparred with their
bills. This second bird was not like the first, and still retained
the winter plumage and was probably an immature female. The
two then swam in company with each other and visited the
nesting place of last year. This was, however, covered with
water, with the exception of a few stumps of wood and reeds.
The male bird appeared, however, to recognise the place, and
dived, bringing up a bunch of weed which he offered to the
female. The two played with it for a long while, then left it.
What made the Grebe bring up this weed ? For they do not feed
on it ; it is the stuff their nests are made of. Could he have
mistaken the time of the year and thought the new nest ought to
have been commenced ? No, it was only perhaps a passing
whim, or he would not have finally left the weed. I am certain
this young bird was not the female of last year, and probably
this action, on the part of the male, of lifting the weed, was to
shew the female how and where to build the nest.
The cries of these two Grebes sounded like &amp;quot; Frak erak
erak ka ka&apos; and at other times like &apos; Ak ah ak ah&apos; and &apos; er erak
er erak&apos; mingled with a buzzing sound. On February 28th I
again visited the place and saw the Grebes meet, shake their
heads, and indulge in the usual &amp;quot;spar.&amp;quot;
When these birds are at rest the head is drawn back be-
tween the shoulders, with the bill either straight out in front or
else tucked under a wing, and usually one leg sticking out of the
water. They are constantly preening their feathers, and their
breasts shine in the sun as silver, especially that of the young
bird, which is a brighter colour than the older one, and has a
purer white breast. The time these birds remained under water
after a dive I noted was from three to five minutes. When
diving they either roll sideways under and disappear without a
ripple, or in head first. On March 5th I saw the female Grebe
was much more advanced about the head than she was a week
ago, and shewed a decidedly more bushy crest. It is remarkable
that birds of this genus come into breeding plumage so early.
They are frequently found thus long before winter is over.*
* A lengthy and comprehensive account of the nesting habits of this species,
by Mr. E. Selous, may be found in the Zoologist for igoi, pp. 339 and 454.

to that of the European one, the Indian ones being smaller, but

Found sparingly at Karachi, common on the Mekran
Coast ; once recorded from Calcutta by Mr. F. Finn, who
obtained alive a specimen there in the Market. This is the
rarest of the Indian Grebes and is not known to have ever
bred in India. I believe I saw once a specimen of this bird
in Tirhoot Bengal, but as I did not shoot it the record is not
wholly satisfactory. As I can find nothing respecting this bird&apos;s
habits in India, I shall quote a few remarks on them as observed
in England by Mr. O. Y. Apliu {Zoologist, Nov. 1904, p. 417). He
says: &amp;quot;This bird which we watched for an hour or so, did not
feed in the open water, but passed from one bed of pond weed to
another, frequently diving for short periods in a limited area.
.... When both birds of a pair were side by side, the larger
size of the male bird was quite apparent, but little or no differ-
ence was to be seen in the plumage of the sexes. The neck,
black before and behind, was clearly divided from the dull white
of the breast and belly (the colour of the under parts was only
seen when the birds raised themselves in the water and flapped
their wings, or rolled on one side to preen themselves) ; when
they flapped their wings the white on the primaries and secon-
daries showed clearly. A black frontal crest stood up, showing
off the silky ear coverts which shone like golden oat straw ; eyes
a bright clear ruby, something like a ripe red-currant with the
light shining through it ; bill black. The rufous feathers of the
flanks, which covered much of the wings when the birds were
swimming in a normal position, shone in the sun with a bronze

lustre. The black neck and wings also showed metallic green
reflections. . . . The birds never travelled far under water, but
dived in a limited area, as Dabchicks do. The consecutive dives
of one bird, which we timed, were 25, 10, 25, 24, 9, 14, 12, 25,
9, and 23 seconds respectively.&amp;quot;

The Indian Dabchick or Little Grebe differs very little
from its European ally P . fluviatilis and by many ornithologists
is only regarded as sub-specifically distinct.
Blauford says : &amp;quot;P. albipennis is distinguished ... by
having the secondaries white throughout in adults, and by the
black on the chin and sides of the face being less extended.&amp;quot;
In habits, mode of nesting, etc. it does not differ one wit
from P. fluviatilis. In the cold season it is to be found in small
parties on all large f heels and tanks. In the summer it migrates
locally, and the paired birds resort for breeding purposes to
almost anywhere where there is sufficient water and shelter, being
then found among paddy fields, quite small ponds, or even 011
moderate sized ditches. It is thoroughly aquatic and is rarely
seen on the wing. Like all other members of its family it is a
■&amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; diver, and on the slightest approach of danger

disappears under water like magic, leaving hardly a ripple on
the surface, to appear again some yards farther off from where it
dived, only to immediately disappear again and so on until it
fancies itself safe. In Bengal at an)&apos;&apos; rate it commences breeding
in July, and many a time have I watched these most interesting
little birds whilst nesting. Both birds during this time kept up
a curious rattling cry, though they are, as a rule, quite silent at
other times of the year. The nest is very untidy, being a large
floating structure, not fastened to any weeds, nor is any attempt
made at binding the materials together in any way; it is simply
a rotting mass of weeds and leaves. It is a mystery to me how
some of the eggs are ever hatched lying as they do in a nest
soaked through and through with water, and I feel sure the eggs
are mostly incubated by the heat of the sun as I have never seen
the birds sitting during the day. The eggs are always covered
up with damp weeds, and these, combined with the heat of the
sun, no doubt set up a sort of fermentation that aids incubation.
During this period they are very restless and keep on taking
short flights across the pond and make a good deal of noise.
The male is most attentive to the female and always keeps close
to her, feeding her on small fish and aquatic insects. The young
when first hatched are pretty little creatures, covered with greyish
down and striped black. I once surprised a party of these birds,
consisting of one old one and five young. The young at once
tried to conceal themselves by hiding among the weeds, while
the old one tried to draw my attention from them by fluttering as
if wounded in front of my boat. Constant persecution makes
them exceedingly wary, but on the other hand, if not molested,
they get comparatively tame. The Indian Dabchick undergoes
two phases of plumage. In winter the upper parts are light
brown and lower parts silky white. In summer the upper parts
are a very dark brown almost approaching to black ; the neck,
chestnut red ; lower parts silky grey, suffused with streaks of
brown. Some birds retain traces of the breeding dress until
November. This is my experience and that also of the writers
of numerous books I have consulted on the subject ; but Mr.
Finn makes the startling statement {Zoologist, 1902, p. 303), that :
&amp;quot; The so-called winter plumage is merely that of immaturity in

this species. I have never seen the pair of birds whose actions I
have noted in any but full adult summer plumage at any time.
It is possible, of course, that this pair are abnormal, or very old
individuals, but there is no proof of this ; and the} r are free birds
leading a perfectly normal life.&amp;quot; In this I cannot agree, and I
have never seen the birds in mid-winter in anything but the
usual winter dress, and very likely, as Mr. Finn himself suggests,
these birds of his wei&apos;e abnormal.
The usual number of eggs I have found were from three to
five, pure white when first laid, but like all Grebes&apos; eggs they
soon get soiled by the action of decaying vegetation on which
the3 T are laid. If a side-blown egg of any of the Grebes be held
to the light it will be seen that the inner texture is a most delicate
and beautiful green. All Grebes, especially the Dabchick, have
a most peculiar odour that clings persistently to the skin, even
after it has dried and lain for years in a cabinet.
It would never do in a paper of this sort to pass over in
silence the so-called Sikhim White Grebe, and I cannot do better
than quote what Blanford says : &amp;quot;A single specimen of a peculiar
whitish Grebe was obtained by the late Mr. Mandelli from a lake
in Native Sikhim. No other skin has been obtained. At Mr.
Mandelli&apos;s request I described the birds as Podiceps albescens.
The skin is, by most ornithologists who have examined it,
thought to be a partial albino of P. albipennis. ... I add
a description. Broad forehead, sides of head anteriorly, includ-
ing the orbits and chin, black ; hind neck and upper neck chest-
nut all round, lower hind neck brownish ; remainder of plumage
white, except the primaries, which are brown ; feathers of the
back, scapulars, and secondaries with dark brown shaft stripes.
Bill and feet coloured as in P. albipennis. Wing 375 ; tarsus i&apos;3.&amp;quot;
I have examined the skin now in the British Museum, and,
if I may offer an opinion, I should certainly say that it is merely
a variety of P. albipennis, though Dabchicks, as a rule, are not
subject to variation. In March 1900, on the Hattowrie lake in
Darbhanga, Bengal, on more than one occasion I myself saw a
peculiar whitish specimen of P. albipennis, but though I went
out for the express purpose of shooting it, I failed to do so. It
may, perhaps, not be out of place here to mention that I have a

skin of a Grebe labelled &amp;quot; Podicipes fluviatilis, Morocco,&amp;quot; which
shows quite as much white on the secondaries as P. albipennis,
but has the black on chin and throat much more developed than
on any skin of Podicipes flicviatilis I have ever seen.

The useful series of books on Indian birds by Mr. Finn
has received another addition in the form of a very nice little
book on the Waders. It consists of upwards of two hundred
pages of letterpress and is in two parts, the first dealing with the
perching and the second with the non-perching Waders.
Few birds are more conspicuous in India than the Waders,
few are more interesting and perhaps none are so little known to
most people.
Mr. Finn deals exhaustively with all of the wading birds
which are found in India, to the number of nearly one hundred
and fifty species. We can heartily recommend this little book to
all who are interested in Waders.
THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.
By Charxes Otis Whitman (in &amp;quot; Congress of Arts and Science,
Universal Exposition, St. Louis 1904,&amp;quot; vol. v.)
This is a carefully thought out article tending to show that
although &amp;quot; Natural selection, orthogenesis, and mutation appear
to present fundamental contradictious&amp;quot; they nevertheless may be
reconciled.
The author objects &amp;quot; to the implication that a definite
variation-tendency must be considered to be teleological because
it is not &apos; orderless.&apos; &amp;quot; He discusses the difficulty of accounting by
natural selection for the incipient stages of useful organisms and
points out that no one of our sense-organs can be traced to a
rudiment, except in the embryological sense; and he observes, —
&amp;quot; Without the assistance of some factor having more continuous
directive efficiency, selection would fail to bring out of the chaos
of chance variation, or kaleidoscopic mutation, such progressive
evolution as the organic world reveals.&amp;quot;
After stating that the &amp;quot; study of the problem of the origin
of species resolves itself &amp;quot; . . &amp;quot;into exhaustive studies of single
favourable characters, in the more accessible portions of their

chequers and bars on the plumage of various Columbtz, his
studies leading him to the conclusion that the chequers are of
very ancient origin, and (as I understand him) that the bars have
been evolved from them : this is certainly not the conclusion to
which a study of the nestling plumage of some at least of the
African doves leads me, inasmuch as the conspicuous spots on
the scapulars and inner secondaries appear in the adults with the
disappearance of the juvenile bars. But the paper requires far
more careful thought and consideration than can be given to it

Some important observations, throwing much light on the
question as to whether the summer plumage of those birds in
which seasonal changes take place, is effected by a direct moult
or by colour change in the feathers themselves, have been carried
out by Mr. C. W. Beebe.
The subject of his observations was a Laughing Gull,
Lartis atricilla, the American representative of our common
Black-headed Gull. This bird was reared from the egg in the
New York Zoological Park, and the change of plumage from the
white-headed winter dress to the summer dress in which the
entire head is a dark slate colour was very carefully observed,
with the result that overwhelming proof was obtained that the
change is effected by a complete moult, and not by any colour
change in the feathers themselves whatever.
The new feathers, which are a dark slate-colour tipped
with white, grow up between the old white feathers of winter
which are gradually shed. As soon as the new feathers attain
their full size the white tips break off, leaving the uniform dark
hood.

We have already called attention in this journal to the
series of excellent publications on the more important American
birds, issued by the United States Department of Agriculture.
The latest of these, which forms Bulletin No. 26 of the
Biological Survey, deals with the distribution and migration of
North American Ducks, Geese and Swans, and is written by Mr.
Wells W. Cooke, assistant in the Biological Survey. It contains
no less than S7 pages of letterpress and a good index.
With the increase of population, the reclaiming of marsh
lands and the habit of shooting the birds after the pairing
season has commenced, the wildfowl of almost all species have
decreased in many cases to an alarming extent, and strict
protection is advocated. No species has suffered more than the
Wood Duck, so well known to us in this country as the Summer
or Carolina Duck, Aix sponsa, one of the most beautiful ducks
in existence. Of this species the author writes: &amp;quot;It is a sad
commentary on our present system of game protection that the

whose breeding range is almost entirely within our boundaries,
is the species which has suffered most. So persistently has this

exterminated. Even in States in which it still breeds commonly,
as in Delaware and Maryland on the Atlantic Coast, and in
Illinois in the Mississippi Valley, public sentiment fails to
recognise the importance of adequately protecting the bird, and
laws still permit it to be destroyed late in the spring. As a
result the Wood Duck is constantly diminishing in numbers, and
soon is likely to be known only from books or by tradition.&amp;quot;
One thing in connection with the Wood Duck is satis-
factory, and that is that it has now become fairly well established
as a domesticated species in Europe, and so is not likely to be
allowed to become extinct.
STRAY NOTES.
The question as to whether the Kea Parrot of New Zealand is really
guilty of the crime of sheep-killing which it has been accused of has at length
been settled and, in spite of the opinion of the Wellington conference, the
bird must be pronounced as guilty. A paper on the subject was read before
the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury, N. Z. on August 8th last by Mr.
George R; Marriner, F.R.M.S., Assistant in the Biological Laboratory of
Canterbury College, in which the author went more thoroughly into the
question than had previously been done. He gave numerous instances in
which the birds had actually been seen to attack and kill the sheep.
The method of attack seems to be practically the same in every case.
A Kea will settle on the ground amongst the sheep, and after hopping
round one of the animals will jump on to its back and commence to tear
away the wool. The sheep becomes frightened and dashes awa}*, but the
Kea holds on tightly, or releases its hold only to fly after the animal and
settle again immediately the sheep thinks it has shaken off its enemy.
Having torn off the wool the Kea commences to dig its sharp bill
into the flesh of the animal, which after rushing about frantically for some
time generally lies down with neck stretched out in a helpless condition,
when the Kea which, by this time, has probably been joined by several
others, continues to tear away the flesh and greedily devour the fat. The
attack is generally made in the early morning or late evening, or on foggy
days, and only those flocks which are kept in the mountainous districts,
where the Keas have their home, are in danger from these birds.
The collection of birds at the Zoological Gardens has been enriched
by a pair of the very rare Mayer&apos;s Pigeon {Nescenas mayeri) from the island
of Mauritius. This species is said to be verging on extinction, and it is

doubtful whether any living example has previously been exhibited in
Europe. This pair was presented to the Zoological Society by Colonel
Mauders, R.A.M.C.
Another very interesting addition to the Zoological Society&apos;s col-
lection is a fine example of the Kagu from New Caledonia, acquired by
purchase. This very interesting species has not been represented in the
Society&apos;s collection since 1885. Some notes on it appeared in this journal
for July 1905 (Vol. III. N. S., p. 2S0).
Mr. F. L. Berney contributes some very interesting field notes from
the Richmond District of North Queensland, to the October number of the
Emu, and some of the birds he refers to are very well-known to aviculturists
in this country.
Of the Zebra or Chestnut-eared Finch Mr. Berney writes :
&amp;quot; During the eight or nine years previous to 1906 /. castanotis has
been our most constant resident in the bird line, but this year, one of
our best seasons on record, when grass and herbage, and therefore, of
course, seed, are in abundance, it has entirely left our district, dis-
appearing as soon as the first general rains fell in January, and so far
(August) it has not shown up again. The contented manner in which
it adapts itself to circumstances, together with its fecundity, will long
ensure its being among the survivors in the struggle for existence. . : .
A pair that built their nest among the rafters inside a boundary-rider&apos;s
hut successfully led forth three broods in three and a half months.&amp;quot;
Of the Budgerigars {Melopsittacus -undulatus) the same author writes :
&amp;quot;Their numbers vary; generally a few are about, but the winter is
the time of their visitation. P&apos;rom March to July last year we had a
wonderful invasion. Their numbers were such that it would be hard to
credit without actually seeing them ; everywhere you went flocks rose
out of the grass, and the air was full of the rush and whirring of their
wings. Some of the immense flocks seen at a distance across the open
downs were hard to tell from dust storms, even by men who knew the
bush well. At one station I heard of forty or fifty being picked up one
morning, killed or maimed, beneath a telephone wire that connected
two buildings 150 yards apart.&amp;quot;
Tn the same number of the Emu Mr. D. Le Soue&apos;f publishes the
following notes from the Melbourne Zoological Gardens :
&amp;quot; A pair of Cape Barren Geese hatched out four young ones early
in June. In July five eggs were laid again in the same nest, the former
young being six weeks old. The bird which did not happen to be
sitting looked after the young, but they clustered round the sitting bird
at night, so were removed and given an unattached male to be looked
after. The second brood were duly hatched in July, and are doing well.

These birds evidently lay two clutches a year. The Emus are sitting,
the male bird doing most of the work of incubating. The Brush-
Turk eys (Telegallus) have made a very large nesting- mound earl}&apos; this

Sir, — I think Mr. Attewell in the October number makes a mistake
in supposing that birds feel as he feels. It is just what they don&apos;t do.
Some birds feel the cold much more than he does, and some much less.
What we want to arrive at is, How do the birds feel ? And we can only
arrive at this by experimenting. But it need not be done with cruelty. A
little observation will show what the bird is feeling as to cold. About
heat it is more difficult. One soon sees that Hang-nests can stand no
cold at all. I lost one from the change produced by a hailstorm coming
over during the afternoon wbeu I was out, and had left my stud}&apos; window
open. It was odd the bird had not enough sense to go into its flannel-lined
basket as it did at night. But it takes some time, and I am afraid some
cruelty, however unintentional, to discover that a King Parrot suffers from
heat. Unfortunately, there is little to guide us. You cannot say allthe
members of one family will feel alike. The Continental Amazons are
hardy ; the Island ones more sensitive. Nor can you say that the birds
of one region will feel alike. The Macaw can enjoy a snow-storm ; the
Caique dislikes any cold. Palcsornis docilis can stand cold ; Pyocephalus
senegalensis cannot— and while Pal. docilis is hardy, longicauda is by no
means so. Most of the Parrots can stand a great deal of cold after they
have been a year in England. But they never can stand draught.
One of our members, who is a very successful breeder of the Aus-
tralian varieties, says that Parrakeets do not mind cold, if the sleeping
house is warm. But I believe he excepts Turquoisiues.
So you can only find out what each bird likes by watching it. When
you find it &amp;quot;cheerful &amp;quot; in a frost then I think there is no doubt it is happier
in a spacious aviary, if it has it to itself. But birds are happy in cages.
I have known wild caught ones return to their cages of their own accord.
Birds&apos; sufferings come from fear, and hunger, and thirst.
F. G. DUTTON.
Sir, — Without question no avicnlturist who has experimented with
foreign birds in this country will agree with Mr. Attewell. Feathers are
probably a greater protection against extremes of temperature than fur;
and, if we are to accept the testimony of Hagenbeck, the polar bear de-
lights to bask and roll in the sun in hot weather; so one cannot conclude,
</bodyText>

Correspondence. 79
because an animal comes from a hot or a cold climate, that it will be
miserable under different conditions. The Gouldian Finch, being a native
of Northern Australia, might be expected to do well in a warm indoor
aviary ; but, as a matter of fact, it does infinitely better, is more healthy,
much more lively, and probably lives longer in an outdoor aviary ; even
though subjected to the frosts of this climate. On bright days, even
when the previous night has been frosty, I have seen my birds bathing in
the ice-cold water of their pan and evidently thoroughly enjoying it. To
speak of this as cruelty is absurd.
The Indian Waxbills are quite happy in frosty weather, as are most
of the more close feathered finches; but the African species, at anyrate
when recently imported, are very susceptible to cold; yet it is possible that,
if turned out at the commencement of the hot weather and kept outside,
they may with the approach of cold weather develop warmer clothing
than they need during the greater part of the year in their own country ;
although some of them must during certain months be subjected to intense
cold at night in their native haunts.
We are also now aware, through the reports of travellers, that some
of the more gorgeous of the birds long regarded as inhabitants of hot
climates, that is some of the H ummiugbirds and Tanagers, occur at con-
siderable altitudes and are quite familiar with the appearance of snow; so
that if we were to confine them in a highly heated aviary we should be
subjecting them to wholl}&apos; unnatural conditions.
In all these things experience is the only satisfactory guide.
A. G. BUTI.ER.
THE INCUBATION OF QUAILS&apos; EGGS.
Sir, — In your most interesting article on Quails in the current
number of the Magazine you give approximately the period of incubation
as 16 to 18 days.
This summer I placed some Rain Quails&apos; eggs in an incubator at
about 10 a.m. on the 27th of May and they hatched at 3 p.m. on the 12th of
June, which gives an incubation period of 16 days 5 hours. The incubator
was kept at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahr. It is almost impossible to
judge the exact incubation period from the birds, especially if they are at
all shy, as they often take to the nest on the afternoon before laying the
last egg and do not leave the nest, as a rule, till from six to eight hours
after the last bird is hatched, so that an error of anything from 18 to 24
hours may creep in. On the other hand with incubator-hatched eggs a
possible error is likely to occur owing to the temperature being slightly
different from that of the natural mother. J. Lewis Bonhote.
PARRAKEET NOTES.

but larger, and that agrees with one I bought of the late Mr. Abrahams:
he called it the Giant Kosella. But I have had a bird sent me recently as
an Adelaide, which appears to be nothing but aver}&apos; poor coloured Pennant,
being a rusty red instead of dark scarlet. The father of thirteen hybrids
I have bred this year with a hen Rosella is exactly like it, and it has been
in my possession about three years.
I have another that came in the same lot from Marseilles that is
more like a Yellow-rumped Parrakeet than anything else, in fact it is like
the picture in Dr. Greene&apos;s book but more brilliant, a little redder on the
rump and abdomen and the tertiaries are not so yellow. I should much
like to know what it really is. It has one great fault: as soon as its tail is
perfect after moult it bites all the feathers off short, just as though some-
one had cut them off with a pair of scissors, but it has never touched any
other feathers. C. P. Arthur.
[The Adelaide Parrakeet is not like a large Rosella but may be com-
pared to a washed-out Pennant, in which the colour, instead of being deep
crimson, is rusty red. Probably the &amp;quot; Giant Rosella&amp;quot; was a Red-mantled
Parrakeet, which is a hybrid between the true Pennant and the Rosella.
The hybrids which Mr. Arthur has reared are evidently bred between the
Adelaide Parrakeet and the Rosella. The other Parrakeet above described
is probably a Yellow-rumped Parrakeet (P. flaveolus), some specimens of
which are quite a brilliant yellow.
The illustration referred to is not particularly good. Ed.].

SWALLOWS AT THE ZOO.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9978484375" page_id="33229040"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
Sir, — When visiting the Zoological Gardens last summer I noticed
a Swallow flying about in one of the Aviaries, which I think was occupied
by Ducks. I asked a gentleman who accompanied me if he knew how long
it had been confined there, and he told me he thought, as far as he could
remember, it had been there all last winter. Can you, or any of your
readers connected with the Zoological Gardens give me any information
about it, whether it really lived through the winter there, and whether it is
still there ? It would be really interesting to know if a Swallow lived in
the open air through our winter. WlLUAM B. Gibbins.
[The Swallow which Mr. Gibbins saw was probably the one which
lived in the Waders&apos; aviary during the summer of 1905 and spent the winter
in the Western Aviary, which is warmed. In the spring of this year it was
again transferred to the Waders&apos; aviary. A number of others have since
been obtained and we cannot say if the original one is still alive.
These birds seem to do well in the aviaries at the Gardens, where
they soon learn to take food from the ground. — Ed.].

the Parrot house in the Zoo, or had last time I was there. Some of them
are a little larger than the ordinal ones, but the main difference is in the
colour between the first and second rings. Instead of being white, or
nearly white, the feathers are brown, not a dead brown, but rather as if a
child had dipped a brush into very wet paint and had painted the white
feathers, giving a patchy effect. I had thought the birds were merely
freaks as it were, but last week I ordered some Bichenos from a dealer.
He had only two left (I had ordered two pairs) and they came yesterday.
One is quite an ordinary Ringed Finch (dealers do not seem to know the
difference between Rings and Bichenos) the other is like those at the Zoo.
It is rather larger, has a broader, bolder looking head, is warmer in colour
and is a patchy brown between the first and second rings. The dealer is
expecting some more next week and m}&apos; second pair is to be sent then. I
am wondering what they will be like. Can they come from a different part
of the country ? I should very much like to know if you have seen them,
and what your theory is regarding them. L. Wiixiams.
The following reply was sent to Mrs. Howard Williams :
I think the dark colour on the breasts of some Bichenos and Ringed
Finches is entirely due to partial melanism, the result of captivity. I have
noticed it on several occasions. Those at the Zoo. were quite normally
coloured when they arrived, and I believe all that are sold with the dark
breasts are birds that have been caged some time. I do not think size has
much to do with the change. Gouldians are also liable to partial melanism
in captivity. D. Seth-Smith.

Sir, — Some time ago I drew the attention of members to the decora-

that in the young of the Diamond Sparrow the mouth is marked with

Sir, — The Forsten&apos;s Lorikeets with which I won last year the

In May the hen laid two eggs and they hatched, but when the young
birds were a fortnight old they were killed b}&apos; some Blue Mountain Lories.
I removed these birds and the Forsten&apos;s Lorikeet laid two more eggs which
were hatched on July 22nd. One of these 3&apos;oung birds died soon after, but
the other one is a fine healthy bird now, out in the aviary. It has its win&amp;quot;-
eathers, and its head and neck feathers, but the body is still mostly down.

round. The parents still feed the little bird, and I think there is every
prospect of its living. It does not seem to feel the cold, and is very well

In our October number appeared an account by Mr. Teschemaker of
the successful breeding of the Red-headed Finch [Amadina erythrocephalus)
in his aviaiy. We can find no record of previous success though on many
occasions eggs have been laid.
In the November issue Mrs. Johnstone records the rearing of young
of the rare Lorikeet Trichoglossus johnstonice. There can be no doubt that
this is the first instance of this species breeding in captivity.
In the present issue Mr. St. Ouiutin tells of his success in breeding
the Pine Grosbeak (Pyrrhula enucleator), Mr. J. H. Gurney the Jackal Buz-
zard [Buteo jackal), and Mr. E. J. Brook the White-eared Conure {Pyrrhura
leucotis). It is hoped that any member or reader who may know of a
previous case of any of these species successfully breeding in the United
Kingdom will immediately communicate with the Editor ; otherwise it is
proposed to award a medal to each of the members mentioned above.
[In our October issue Sir William Ingram records the successful rear-
ing in his aviary of a young Red Mountain Dove (Geotrygon montana), but
this species, we find, bred at the Zoological Gardens on several occasions
from 1S63 to 1870].

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and post-
age paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, Lanherne, Bexley Heath, Kent, and must be
accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of the case, and a fee
of 1/- for each bird. If a reply by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries can only be reported on by post.
Zebra-finch (H.) Your bird died of apoplexy.
Lovebird (Miss E. Douglas). The bird sent was a cock. Was much
emaciated, and died of heart failure through weakness. It is just
possible the hen has kept this one from obtaining sufficient food and it
has got gradually weaker and weaker. There was no disease.

By B. G. B. Meade-Waldo, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Before leaving Brazil, I ought to mention the Parrots
that we came across. Of these by far the commonest was the
Golden-crowned Conure, Conurus aureus. This bird was very
common, and flocks were repeatedly passing at different eleva-
tions : it was very noisy. When settled in trees and bushes it
was very tame and could be readily approached. There are two
fine specimens of this Couure in the Parrot House at the Zoo-
logical Gardens at the present time. The common Blue-fronted
Amazon, Chrysotis csstiva, was also common enough, and rather
more shy than most of the birds. The pairs when flying over
would occasionally indulge in a very curious &amp;quot;hovering&amp;quot; kind
of flight. We also saw, but did not procure, a small Parrakeet,
and we did not see it in the market in Bahia.
On leaving Brazil we steamed South-Bast to the Island of
South Trinidad. This tropical island is uninhabited and but
rarely visited. We were fortunate in having calm weather for
landing, and spent two most delightful days there. Although
extremely interesting to the ornithologist, this island might not
be so much so to the aviculturist, as its present avifauna is
purely marine, consisting of two Frigate Birds, Fregata aqzcila and
F. ariel ; two Petrels, CEstrelata t7&apos;initatis and CE. arminjo?iiana ;
two Terns, the common Noddy, Anous stolidus, and the Sooty
Tern, Sterna fiiliginosa\ a Gannet, Sula piscator ; and a beauti-
ful little white Tern, Gygis cratvfordi. This latter proved to be
uudescribed and is named after Lord Crawford. This exquisite

84 Mr. E. G. B. Meade- Waldo,
little bird swarmed in myriads all over the island, and was quite
without fear of man, as indeed were all the other birds. It laid
its one egg without any nest whatever, either on a boulder, a
ledge of rock, the branch of a tree, and very often on the up-
turned roots and branches of the dead trees with which the
island is covered. The diameter of the egg was frequently
greater than that of the branch or root on which it was deposited,
and I frequently saw some eggs balanced between two thin
branchlets. If there ever was a land-bird on this island it has
disappeared with the perishing of the indigenous timber, for
although there are a few trees, and some scrub on the summit of
the island, the tree-fern forest covers the greater part of the
valley on the leeward side.
From South Trinidad we sailed and steamed via Tristan
d&apos;Acuuha, where we were unable to land owing to bad weather,
to Cape Town. Here some time was spent. Birds did not
appear to abound in Cape Town, but with the exception of our
Chimney-Swallow, Hirundo rustica, who was wintering there, but
in no great numbers, we saw no European birds.
The most striking birds of the town and gardens are, first,
the House-Sparrow, which is not Passer domesiicus but P. arcua-
tus, and did not appear to be remarkably abundant. A &apos;• White-
eye,&amp;quot; Zosterops capensis, a Pied Wagtail, Moiacilla capensis, the
Cape Robin Chat, Saxicola familiaris, Cape Turtle- Dove, Turtur
■capicola, a Sunbird, Nectarinia faniosa, a Promerops, and others ;
but in the bay and especially right in the inner harbour, the
Jackass Penguins, Spheniscus de7ners7is, and Cape Cormorants
are most interesting from their numbers and extreme familiarity.
One of the most delightful expeditions was one to Dasseu
Island, that was most kindly arranged by Mr. W. L. Sclater.
Dassen Island, about 40 miles N.-W. of Cape Town, is a great
breeding- place of Penguins and Cormorants. The birds are
preserved by the Colonial Government for guano, and the Pen-
guins also for eggs. The Island is some two miles long by one
mile wide, and is entirely given up to the birds, there being a
family living on the island as keepers. There is also a light-
house, in which we were most hospitably entertained for the
night. We were told that it was the &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; season when we were

there, but even if it was so it did not matter as many thousands
of Jackass Penguins were on every side, the island being practi-
cally covered. They were breeding everywhere : many had
eggs, some in slight hollows in the ground, others in burrows,
and fountains of sand might be seen flying up in all directions
where burrowing was going on. There were many young of all
sizes ; and quantities of dead young were lying about. The
Penguins were quite indifferent to us, and beyond biting your
fingers if you put your hand under a sitting bird, took 110 notice.
Many groups of moulting birds were about : these never go to
sea during the moult. The pairs are very affectionate, and it is
very comical to see the male guiding the female the way he
wants her to go with a flipper. Large numbers of the eggs are
eaten in Cape Town, principally by the Malays. They are the
size of Turkey&apos;s, very strong in the shell, and greenish in colour.
The male collects a certain amount of nesting material, but no
nest is built. This is the Penguin that may be seen living,
thriving and breeding in the Sea-L,ions&apos; enclosure at the Zoo-
logical Gardens, where two particularly fine young have been
reared during the past summer; and some more may be seen
•sitting at present. They are charmingly tame pets. We brought
one away from the island, a tiny young one, and reared it on the
yacht. It gave me much pleasure and although it felt the ex-
treme damp heat of the Indian Ocean, throve well, and is now to
be seen in the Gardens, where it is just about to moult into
adult plumage, being about ten months old. This young Pen-
quin, when on the yacht, used to run about the deck with two
Sacred Ibises, which it was really quite fond of, but on occasions
when in a playful mood, it used to turn on them suddenly, seize
-one with its beak, hold on, and give it a good beating with one
of its flippers, a comical proceeding which used to take place
nearly every evening. The Penguin cunningly stalked the Ibises,
who always knew quite well they were being stalked.
These Ibises, the &amp;quot; Sacred Ibis,&amp;quot; Ibis csthiopica, we took
from the nest, the latter being one of a colony which was
attached to a large colony of Cape Cormorants, Pkalacrocorax
capeusis. The Ibises were the shyest birds on the island, as they
are treated as vermin, having the reputation of robbing the^old^

Cormorants of the food they are bringing for their young, and
also of eating the entrails of the young themselves. Young
Ibises when handled certainly disgorged a mass of entrails !
The strict preservation of the Cormorant, which is the best
guano producer, indirectly preserves the Ibis. As until the
main body of the young Cormorants have flown, no one enters a
Cormorant colony, for if the Cormorants leave their nests, these
are immediately pounced upon \&gt;y the Black-backed Gulls, Larus
dominicamis, which are always waiting for the opportunity.
These } T oung Sacred Ibises throve and were almost omnivorous ;
they certainly preferred meat to fish, but they were fond of bread,
raisins and banana, and were always robbing other birds in cages
of their dainties. They had no trouble in getting any thing they
wanted with their long curved beaks. The}&apos;&apos; were great consu-
mers of gravel, which was ejected as a casting in a few hours
covered with mucous. I saw a wild Abbott&apos;s Ibis (of this more
anon) go through this performance, and observed that some of
the casting was composed of unripe berries. These young Ibises
may now be seen In the Zoological Gardens, remarkably fine
healthy birds, in full plumage with the exception of the neck,
which is still covered with small black and white feathers. They
have already changed their ornamental &amp;quot;decomposed&amp;quot; second-
aries three times, those they are now wearing being apparently
mature.
This island was extremely interesting, and we had too short
a time on it. We were told that about nine million Penguins
resorted there : it seemed quite possible. The colonies of Cape
Cormorants dotted about amongst the Penguins must have
numbered many thousand birds. The Black - backed Gull was
too numerous. We saw also the Bank-duiker, Phalacrocorax neg-
lechis ; the Black Oyster- Catcher, Hcematopus moquini, a pair of
which may be seen now in the Eastern Aviary at the Zoo. And,
floating in a bay close to where we re-embarked, were several
Giant Petrels, Ossifraga gigantea, evidently gorged with good
things so easily picked up on and around this island.
I may incidentally remark that the guano from this island
is sold to the Cape farmers at about £6 ios. per ton. The Pen-
guins&apos; eggs are sold up to ios. per ioo ; 21,000 eggs were taken

TOURACOU.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
In the November (1904) number of the Magazine (N. S.
Vol. III. No. 1) an account was written of the successful nesting
but the unsuccessful rearing of the young of Fraser&apos;s Touracou,
and in the following issue a hope was expressed that the missing
link in the life of the young bird might at some future time be
added.
Through the patient perseverance of these birds aided by
clumsy attempts on my part to supply as far as possible, sub-
stitutes for their natural food and nesting accommodation (a
poor exchange for their own tropical forests and never-ending
supplies of animal diet), I am now able to add that link.
Last year the nesting took place in a small outdoor aviary
•quite exposed to the weather, and when the young one flew, as
now I have no doubt that it did, and was not pushed out by its
parents as I imagined — it fluttered into some wet long grass,
with the result that it promptly died of exposure and cold. This
happened on two occasions.
In the early winter of last }^ear my new aviaries were com-
pleted and the birds placed therein, and the divisions, although
not large, are quite large enough to give these energetic birds
room for exercise. Half a hurdle, closely covered with ropes of
hay, so closely that it formed an even platform, was placed high
in a corner on a level with the top of the door and as far from
the window as possible. On this platform a rough nest of sticks
was built close to the wall and to the edge of the hurdle nearest
the door — a clever place, and the only place in the aviary which
it was not easy to see from the wire door.
On April 5th one egg was laid and, after three weeks&apos;
patient sitting on the part of both parents, proved unfertile.

<bodyText confidence="0.994917842105263" page_id="33229054"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
On May igth another was laid with the same result, and
between June 30th and July 2nd a clutch of two eggs was laid by
the persevering hen, and on Wednesday, July 24th, one of these
eggs hatched. The probability is that the second egg laid after
June 30th was the one hatched, as previously the hen incubated
the eggs almost exactly three weeks.
The first sign of the advent of the baby was that the cock,
who was sitting at the time, raised himself upright and fed some
small dark object from his crop, placing his beak right into the
beak of the young one and feeding it much as a pigeon feeds
its young. I was able to see the process clearly many times, b\ r
the aid of a hole in the match-boarding dividing the divisions,
and standing in the next division I could examine the nest
without being seen by the old birds.
I need hardly describe the appearance of the baby, as a
minute description was published in a previous number of the
Magazine (December 1904). But after a few days he could
scramble about on the hay platform quite energetically, the
parents brooding him very closely, and not until he was three
weeks old and beginning to grow his wing- and tail-feathers
was he left much to himself.
Long before the body-feathers replaced the brown down
the wing- and tail-feathers were quite developed, and this
absence of body- covering probably caused the death of the
previous young ones.
In the West African tropics this would be no incon-
venience, but in our variable climate proved fatal as regards the
former young ones.
On the 1 8 th of August the young bird flew, that is, he was
discovered perching on a bough on the ground, and looking
ridiculously small and unfledged to be out of his nest at all.
That this state of things was quite normal, I have 110
doubt : he moved easily about the floor, covering the ground
with quick long hops, and generally returned to his bough,,
where he sat humped up and waited for the constant meals with
which his parents provided him.
As seen in the brighter and clearer light he was a dark
rusty blue, almost black, very vulturiue in appearance, with his

large beak, almost bare head, and perfectly developed wing- and
tail-feathers.
Up to now I had fed the old birds on cut-up banana,,
soaked biscuit squeezed dry, sweet water-grapes and mealworms,
any caterpillars I could get, and some silkworms which were
much appreciated.
I now added bread and milk (not sloppy) to the diet, and
was interested and pleased to find they took readily to it ; it
helped much in the rearing of the youngster, and I have not
discontinued it since, as they seem so fond of it.
The baby grew very slowly ; and at one time I thought I
should never rear him. My coachman — a great admirer of the
Touracou family — here came to the rescue, and fed the baby once
or twice in the day with bread and milk, banana, or grapes. He
soon began to improve and grow, and the parents, seeing that he
was developing into quite a nice child, took to him again and fed
him so industriously, that all outside help was discontinued.
Whether this neglect was caused by the birds thinking of another
nest, I cannot say, but on August 30th, when the young bird was
about nine weeks old, the hen laid two more eggs, which how-
ever proved unfertile.
And now the 3&apos;oungster began to grow rapidly and to
improve in every way; he started a funny little crest at the top of
his head, just a few hairs with a slight curl. The green plumage
could now be seen shimmering on his neck and back, and the
flight-feathers certainly became bluer, although not until October
24th did his first red feather appear in the wing.
He always roosted next his mother when she was sitting
on the eggs, and indeed spent much of the daytime there too.
When about ten weeks old he began to feed himself, picking up
fallen scraps from the floor, and used to regularly bathe in the
wide shallow pan, sometimes with his parents sometimes with-
out, and it was a pretty sight to see all three birds splashing
and washing together vigorousiy.
Now, as I write, he has almost assumed the full plumage ;
the white eyebrow mark is clearly defined, and he is only dis-
tinguished from the old birds, by being rather smaller in size and
duller in plumage. May I add a hope that as some Touracous

By A. G. Butler, Ph.D., etc.
To the average aviculturist I believe good and evil fortune
come in about equal proportions: if he is particularly fortunate
one year, the chances are that, in the following year, he will have
no luck whatever ; but I am sure of this, that the more outdoor
aviaries a man has, the better chance has he of continuous
success.
During the past year, although I have not bred many
birds, I consider that I have little cause for grumbling: it is true
that not a few nice birds have died in my aviaries ; but, on the
other hand, I have been unusually favoured with presents from
friends both outside and inside the Society.
In February, with the hope that I might breed some of the
Australian Grassfinches, I purchased three pairs of Munia flavi-
prymna, one pair of Poephila acaticauda, one pair P. mirabilis
(which died between the 2nd and 4th May) ; one pair Stictoptera
annulosa and a male BatJiilda riificaiida : not one of these has
bred, but the hen 5&amp;quot;. annulosa disappeared about the 20th Sept.,
and reappeared shortly afterwards.
On March 6th my Green-winged Doves (Australian) built
a nest in a box in the outdoor aviary and the male began chasing
about the cock Bronzewing pigeon ; I therefore removed the
Bronzewings to an indoor aviary, but to no purpose, inasmuch as
the Ouzels prevented the Green-wings from breeding.
On March 9th I noticed that one of last )^ear&apos;s young
Gouldian Finches was unwell; it however recovered, but was
taken ill again on September 23rd : it is the hen bird. Why
should female finches always be more liable to illness than males ?
On the 12th my female Wells&apos; Ground-dove died, having
been continuously laying and sitting upon clear eggs since the
beginning of the previous year.

o?i the Vicissitudes of Bird- Keeping. 91
On the 20th I received a cage of interesting finches from
an unknown friend, apparently a sea-captain, to whom I have no
clue excepting that his Christian name is Robert. The consign-
ment comprised two pairs of Munia flaviprymna, one pair and a
blind female of M. pectoralis, one female Poephila gouldice, one male
Pytelia emini (interesting on account of the broader and darker
grey-brown bars of the under tail - coverts, which distinguish
it to the eye from P. phoenicoptera without looking beneath its
wings). Captain Shelley does not consider P. e??iini to be a
distinct species, but it is certainly a pleasing local form.
I thus commenced the season with five pairs of Munia
flaviprymna, of which I put one pair outside, one pair in a large
flight, two pairs in an indoor aviary ; one female broke its wing
and subsequently drowned itself and the odd male I kept in a
store-cage : none of these birds went to nest.
On March 20th the hen Chinese Quail began to lay and
continued right up to the middle of September first in one place
then in another; not sitting steadily excepting once, when the
eggs had already been laid too long to hatch : altogether at least
forty eggs were deposited.
On May 19th I had another piece of good fortune : — our
Member Miss Gladstone very kindly ordered a pair of Violet-
eared Waxbills from Mr. Hamlyn as a present for me. I turned
them into my smaller outdoor aviary where they flew about
happily enough ; but in the evening they persisted in roosting
under the open wire-work at the end of the aviary where all the
neighbours&apos; cats delight in congregating : I therefore laid a large
piece of stained glass over the wire-work and this induced them
to settle elsewhere.
On the 21st the female Violet-ear dropped dead in the act
of flight from no apparent cause ; the male however looked
healthy until the afternoon of the 26th when I noticed it asleep
on a branch ; I therefore caught it and discovered that it must
have been fighting, as its head was rather badly pecked: I
brought it indoors, but it died on the 27th.
My Bronzewinged Pigeons went to nest in May, and con-
tinued to lay and sit up to September, invariably breaking their
eggs as usual : the male is rather heavy-footed, doubtless an old

bird : on two occasions there were partly developed young in the
shells.
On May 25th I bought two healthy-looking pairs of Estrilda
phcenicotis and kept them in a flight-cage together until June 3rd,
when I turned one pair outside and a hen into one of my indoor
aviaries, where I had and still have a well-seasoned cock bird :
the following morning I found both hens dead, with nothing
whatever to show why they died. L,ater in the year the male
outside died and I gave the odd male away.
On June 17th my Yellowish finches began to worry a hen
Ribbon-finch, so I removed them to a smaller aviary where they
soon began to carry hay into a box, one chasing the other and
singing excitedly: however nothing came of it and both I and
Mr. Seth -Smith feel sure that the two are cock birds.
On July 1st a hen Staganopleiwa g7ittala, bought last year,
died egg-bound ; which, in my experience, is the usual fate of
hens of this species in captivity.
July 13th Miss Gladstone very kindly sent me a pair of
Erythrura pi&apos;asina, but on the 15th I noticed the cock eating in-
cessantly and was not surprised to find it dead on the 16th. The
same kind friend ordered a second pair for me ; the cock arrived
on the 21st with a broken leg, the supposed hen (a young cock
out of colour) seemed healthy; both were dead by the 29th.
Miss Gladstone then ordered two cock birds forme which arrived
on August 2nd, but were in female plumage excepting that the
head looked bluish ; these and the original hen are still living
and healthy : both cocks are now in full colour.
My English Goldfinches went to nest in one of my indoor
aviaries in July; one young one was half feathered when my
Poephila acuticauda attacked it on the 28th, pecking a great hole
in its back and dragging it out on to the floor.
On August 13th Mr. Teschemaker very kindly sent me his
pair of young Black Tanagers : they were delayed so long on the
railway that they arrived quite dazed with hunger and thirst ;
the hen was in the worse case and has been more or less out of-
sorts ever since.
September 4th. As noted in a previous paper my Stictop-
tera bichenovii died from heat-apoplexy. On the 8th I caught up

and brought indoors all the birds in my larger garden aviary. which
badly required painting : my young Ouzels greatly resented their
restricted liberty, but their father (Merula boulboul) and the pair
of Green-winged doves took it as a matter of course.
On the 12th a young Gouldiau-finch left the nest and 011
the 14th a second flew: on the 15th I saw both young birds
feeding themselves !
September 13th Mr. Teschemaker sent me a young Red-
headed finch and a young Green Avadavat ; the latter however
was dead on the floor of the aviary on the 16th, having probably
been scared by my going out to see that all was safely locked up&apos;
on the evening of the previous day. On the 13th also Mr. Allen
Silver brought me a pair of young Tree Sparrows, a species
which I had not previously kept.
September 17th Capt. Horsbrugh sent me a cock Grenadier
Weaver {Pyroinelana oryx) and a very interesting variety of the
Red-billed Weaver (Qzcelea qicelea.)
On the 23rd of the same month, as already stated, last
year&apos;s young hen Gouldian-finch looked ill and panted a good
deal, and later on the young cock bird became puffed and sleepy ;
but eventually both recovered without treatment. Undoubtedly
the fact of these birds having been bred out-of-doors and kept
out quite late in the year, rendered them vigorous enough to
resist what was probably a mild attack of septicaemia due to mice
getting into the aviary.
October 12th. My old hen Madagascar Love-bird, which
had murdered both her companions during the past two years,
died suddenly. On the day following the hen young Black
Tanager died and the cock was taken ill ; he also died on the
15th. There is 110 doubt that neither ever recovered from the
delay, caused by railway officials, in their transit from Devon-
shire, and the consequent want of food and drink to which they
had been subjected for many hours : for the two months during
which they were in my possession they were very peevish
and always quarrelling, so that their skins were not worth
preserving.
On the 23rd Mr. Teschemaker sent me a pair of mongrel

semblance to the hybrids which I bred some years previously
between the Sharp-tailed finch and Bengalee.
On the 26th I discovered a young Tambourine Dove, pro-
bably about fourteen days of age, below the old nest, dead ; so
that my doves must have nested a second time in September.
Oct. 30. My last Diamond-finch died, a cock bird in most
interesting plumage, some of the central breast- feathers tipped
with crimson ; this clearly proves, as I stated in my article on
Hybrid Ploceidcz, that the ancestral form of the species must have
had red on the breast, and also indicates relationship to Emblema
fticta.
My young hybrid Ouzels were now in adult colour, ap-
parently two cocks and one hen, although one of the cocks has
not yet acquired the orange-yellow bill excepting along the
margins of the tomium. The hen is much paler than last year&apos;s
bird and nearly resembles the ordinary female of Menda boulboul
with a large reddish-brown patch on the wing partly bordered by
ashy-whitish streaks: the male birds are smoky-black with a
red-brown wing-patch answering to the whitish-bordered grey
patch of M. boulboul ; their feet are dark like those of M. merula.
It therefore seems probable that the grey patch in M. boulboul
was evolved through the red-brown patch still retained by its
female.
On Nov. 27th Iyieut. Horsbrugh sent me two cock Red-
headed finches and two hen Serins, apparently the St. Helena
and Sulphur Seed-eaters.
My Crested Mynah, which was an old bird when I bought
it in 1896, after suffering for about two months from a violent
cough, which neither prevented it from bathing daily, nor affected
its spirits, died suddenly on the 28th.
On Dec. 1st Miss Gladstone sent me her Haugnest, a
beautiful sulphur yellow variety of what appears to be Icterus
vulgaris : there is a somewhat similar specimen among the skins
in the Natural History Museum.

evidently thoroughly enjoying it, is certainly a strong argument
in favour of the open-air treatment for many foreign birds.

By R. Suggitt.
Although my acquaintance with the Yellow Sparrow has
not extended over a long period, I have found it a most desirable
aviary bird. It is lively and interesting, and, given a fair amount
of room, may safely be associated with the smallest finches. It
always gives one the impression that it has some serious business
on hand which leaves it no time to interest itself in the concerns
of others.
The male is a really handsome bird, his only fault (not a
very serious one) being a monotonous and constantly repeated
chirp.
I bought a reputed pair of young birds in their nest
feathers early in August, 1905, from a dealer, and after keeping
them in a cage for a few days, put them into my outdoor aviary
and waited patiently for the brighter colored bird to assume adult
plumage. Meanwhile it repaired an old nest in one of the hedges,
laid two eggs and abandoned them. This decided the question of
sex for the other was undoubtedly a hen.
Throughout the winter they were very shy and only
to be seen occasionally, but they gradually became bolder,
and one of them, early in May, attempted to build a nest
in a small hawthorn tree. After struggling unsuccessfully for
three or four days to lay a foundation of coarse twigs, she
abandoned the site and commenced to carry sticks and hay into
a Hartz cage under the shelter.
On May the 5th I purchased for a few coppers a very fine
male specimen of the Tree Sparrow {Passer montanus) and put
him into the aviary, hoping he would pair with one of the hens^of

96 Mr. R. Suggitt,
P. luteus. On May the ioth I saw him making love to the one
which was building, and the next day I removed an egg from the
Hartz cage. On the 12th she had so fav finished the nest as to be
lining it with feathers. It contained another egg and I replaced
the one I had taken out. Four eggs were laid and then the pair
appeared to take no further interest in the nest, for I never saw
them go near it until May 25th, when I was surprised to see the
hen dart into the cage with a fly in her beak, and, on examining
the nest I found it contained at least one young bird.
I now had to face the difficulty of supplying this pair with
sufficient insect food to feed their brood, not an easy task where
upwards of a hundred other birds occupy the same enclosure.
However, at the risk of the hen deserting, I fixed a small
■dish about fifteen inches from the nest and some six inches
lower. To keep this supplied with mealworms, spiders, greenfly
and caterpillars called for considerable exertion ; these birds
absolutely refuse to touch wood-lice, gentles, or earwigs. Two
daj&apos;S later the young hybrids&apos; voices could be distinctly heard.
All went well for some days : the main duty of the Tree-
Sparrow appeared to be the defence of the food dish against all
coiners, which caused friction between his family and a pair of
Swaiuson&apos;s Sparrows, who had built a nest some six feet away,
and who no doubt thought they had a right to a share of the
tit-bits. The crisis came a few days later, but luckily I was on
hand and saw a pitched battle between the hen Yellow Sparrow
■and one of the Swainsous, while the other Swainson threw the
three youngsters out of the nest. All this occurred before I re-
covered from my astonishment. I rescued the young ones, one of
which had been carried some distance and deposited behind a
bush. Apparently they were little the worse for their adventure
when I put them back into the nest. The hen had lost a lot of
feathers and appeared to be damaged generally, but the Tree
Sparrow was absent during this disturbance— he had probably
been severely handled on some previous occasion.
After a great deal of trouble (for I never saw a more
■cunning bird) I recaptured the Swaiuson&apos;s. One of the hybrids
was nicely featheied, the other two being much more backward.
On June 3rd two heads could be seen at the entrance to

the nest, and on the 5th one youngster was standing in full view.
Half an hour later it was on the ground, but was unable to fly,
and its head and neck seemed to be twisted and paralysed. I
put it back into the nest and found it there dead the next
morning : the back of its head was soft as if the skull had been
broken by a blow, which may have been caused by its fall of nine
feet. There was one other in the nest fully feathered also dead,
the third one I could not find.
In the meantime the other hen had built in a cocoanut
husk, and although she, like the first hen, did not appear to be
sitting, I watched her closely about the time I thought the eggs
would hatch, and on the morning of June 19th I saw her with
insects in her beak.
This nest contaiued one young one and three infertile
eggs. This hybrid progressed very rapidly, and on July 2nd was
out of the nest but unable to fly more than a yard or two : when
I visited the aviary the next morning it was perched on the
hedge.
The Tree-Sparrow now took entire charge of the young
bird, both hens having gone to nest again. For a few days he
fed it almost entirely on spiders, house-flies, etc. On the 6feh
July I noticed both birds at one of the seed hoppers, the old
bird husking the seed and the young hybrid taking it from
the tip of his beak. On the 12th it could husk its own seed.
It was fed by the cock until the 17th, after which it appeared to
be entirely independent, and is now (October) one of the liveliest
birds in the aviary.
About the middle of August I introduced into the aviary
a male Yellow Sparrow. He at once built a huge untidy nest
and tried his hardest to induce one of the hens to join him but,
so far as I could see, without success. One of the hens hatched
four more birds, which left the nest late in September, and the
very pale colour of three of them leads me to suspect that both
their parents are Yellow Sparrows. The fourth is much darker
and I am inclined to think of mixed parentage.
Seeing that both sexes of the young of the Tree-Sparrow
in their nest plumage greatly resemble their parents it would not
be unreasonable to expect that the young hybrids would in some

degree resemble their male parent. This, however, was not the
case for all three of them were almost like young House-Sparrows,
except that they were much smaller.
The survivor has now completed its nest- feather moult ; its
wings are marked with two distinct bars, and it has a vinous-
buff eyebrow streak, otherwise little or no change has taken
place in the colour of its plumage.

Those who have kept Cranes under close observation must
often have noticed evidence of exceptional intelligence in these
birds.
Amongst birds there are no more devoted parents, and
they exhibit great constancy and affection towards their mates;
and even attachment to their owners. This applies particularly
to solitary individuals.
I was very much interested a few evenings ago to see how
cleverly some of my Cranes took advantage of their artificial
surroundings to secure an active prey, which they evidently
considered a delicacy.
I first noticed a male White-naped Crane (Leucauche?i)
stride quietly up to a high wire fence, and capture something at
the foot of the netting. Then I saw that this bird&apos;s mate was
standing attentively watching another part of the same fence a
little way off, while two Siberian Cranes (JLeucogeramis) were
doing the same thing in another part of the paddock, each
keeping apart from the other, but close to the wire netting.
The male White Crane is very tame, and I was able to move
gently up, and to stand within three paces of him for some ten
minutes without disturbing him. I saw, as I suspected, that the
dor-beetle was the quarry ; and while I stood by the Crane he
secured seven of these insects, which struck the fence in their
clumsy, circling flight, and fell to the ground. From time to
time the other birds were making similar captures, so that
evening a good &amp;quot;bag&amp;quot; must have been made of the beetles.
The insects were not crushed at all, but were immediately

swallowed. At the distance of a few feet I could trace the
progress of the unfortunate struggling beetle down the gullet of
the Crane ; and once when the insect had only travelled half-way
down the long neck, the Crane put down his head and scratched
his chin with his foot, afterwards finishing the swallowing
process with the most complete unconcern !

Munia domes tica, Flower.
By Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
In the December number of our Magazine Captain Stanley
S. Flower questions the decision of myself and others touching
the descent of the Bengalee from the Striated Finch ; and, after
calling attention to the fact that I formerly adopted Mr. Abrahams&apos;
opinion and believed this bird to be a result of hybridism between
the Striated Finch and Indian Silverbill, that Russ thought it a
•descendant from the Sharp-tailed Finch, and Wiener either of
the Sharp-tailed or the Striated Finch, he proceeds to ask
whether anyone has actually succeeded in producing it from
typical Uroloncha striata or \&gt;y crossing U. striata with any
•other species, and to what extent the three varieties of the
Bengalee breed true.
There has never been any question in the minds of
aviculturists as to the Bengalee having been produced by the
Japanese: the German name &amp;quot; Japanesische Movchen &amp;quot; and the
fact that it is so far as I am aware, only imported from Tokio,
indicate this ; while Mr. Wiener&apos;s remarks seem to show that
the character even of the cages in which the Japs breed this
domesticated race is known : — &amp;quot; Through being bred by the
Japanese in miniature cages.&amp;quot;
Touching the various origins attributed to this bird, it
may first be noted that the hybrid origin suggested by the late
Mr. Abrahams and adopted by myself was mainly based upon
the fact that the varieties of the Bengalee, but more especially
those which least resemble the Striated Finch, are decidedly
smaller than the latter and show lateral crescentic markings ; I
also regarded it as not improbable that the bird was of hybrid

ioo Dr. A. G. Butler,
origin in that, although a domesticated bird, it is by no means
very prolific : I subsequently came to the conclusion that a
hybrid, if fertile, would be likely to throw back to one or other
of the parent stocks in its descendants, as Dr. Russ says is the
case when the offspring of Amadina crythrocefihala and A . fasciata
are bred with : there is nothing to prevent the descendants of a
species which have their liberty curtailed from being smaller
than their ancestors, and the dark brown and white variety ol
the Bengalee so nearly approaches the Striated Finch in general
appearance and in song, that the introduction of the Indian
Silverbill into its pedigree seems unnecessary.
With regard to the question of Uroloncha aadicauda as the
parent stock, I believe the small dealers were responsible; inas-
much as they regularly sold the true U. acuticauda as U. striata
and vice versa, whereas the larger dealers, who took the trouble to
name their birds at public Museums, sold both species under
their correct denominations. It is quite conceivable that Dr.
Russ, purchasing his Sharp-tailed Finch from one man and his
Striated Finch from another, should have been puzzled how to
distinguish them, and therefore should have published only one
description for the two. If this view be accepted it simplifies
matters ; the Striated Finch then being universally intended, and
therefore accepted, as ancestor of the Bengalee. It is true that
Mr. Wiener observes &amp;quot; Whether it was originally the Striated or
the Sharp-tailed Finch from which the Japanese bred the White
Bengalee has not been ascertained, and perhaps never will be
determined&amp;quot;; but then the fact that Russ gave one vague des-
cription for the two and the Black-rumped relative of U. striata
doubtless influenced him.
Assuming however that the Bengalee is descended from
the Striated Finch, it is strange that when paired up with the
Sharp-tailed Finch, it produces young hardly distinguishable
from the latter, and that when paired up with the wild Striated
Finch the young still far more closely resemble Sharp-tailed
Finches than anything else : both have a few extra white feathers
in wing or tail, but otherwise they might pass for U. acnticaiida.
I bred the former some years ago in one of my flight-cages (as
noted in &amp;quot;Foreign Bird-Keeping&amp;quot;) and Mr. Teschemaker sent me

a pair of the latter, recently bred by himself, on October 23rd last.
Is this tendencj&apos; to reproduce U. acuticauda an indication that
the latter (and not U. striata) is the real ancestor of the Bengalee?
If so, why is it that some of the dark brown and white examples
of the Bengalee so much more closely resemble typical U. striata,
even to the colouring of the beak, than U. acutica?tda. Has the
latter ever been crossed with the first steps in the production of
the Bengalee with a view to the origination of the paler coloured
varieties? If so, is the reproduction of yonng resembling U.
acuticauda due to the use of a buffish and white mother, inherit-
ing characteristics of the Sharp-tailed Finch. *
If, as Mr. Wiener says, the Japanese have kept and bred
birds for about three thousand years, there seems nothing at all
improbable in their having imported species from India, Ceylon
or Malaysia to experiment with : I see no more reason why they
should limit their studies to the birds of their own islands or of
the nearest mainland than why we should.
I do not believe the Bengalee has been reproduced in
Europe either from a wild stock or hy crossing two wild stocks;
but then it must be remembered that where a bird already exists,
there is not the inducement to reproduce it that there would be
if one were creating something new ; it would also probably
require the lives of several successive generations of breeders to
bring the form with its three varieties to perfection, and our
children rarely take an interest in the same pursuits as their
parents.
In breeding with a pair of the same variety of the Bengalee
I have found the young fairly true to colour ; the dark brown and
white (most like U. striata&apos;) varies much as regards the amount
of white in the plumage and the white variety sometimes throws
a spot or two of buffish, but I have never bred the dark brown
type from either of the others : I should not be surprised to find
white young in a nest of buff and white birds, especially if they
had been closely inbred.
It is doubtless because the Bengalee is quite unknown as a
wild bird, and is generally recognised as a domesticated or
* I know that t used such a bird, but whether Mr. Teschemaker did so or not, I
cannot tell. ~\

fanciers&apos; bird, that the Museum Catalogue ignores its existence :
in like manner the existence of the white variety of Munia
(Padda) oryzivora, bred by the Chinese, is ignored ; as also the
familiar sports of the domesticated Canary and Rock-Pigeon.
With regard to the use of the specific name Urceginthus
bengalus for the Crimson-eared Waxbill or Cordou-bleu, I think
it a pit}&apos; ; because one can never be certain that it was intended
for Benguela and not a blunder on the part of the describer. (In
the old days nearly every Natural History specimen, the locality
of which was unknown, was labelled as &amp;quot;Habitat in India&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot; in Indiis,&amp;quot; there being apparently little appreciation of the
difference even between East and West Indies), but whether the
describer of the Cordou-bleu meant bengala to indicate that it
came from Bengal or Benguela, it is not likely that it will ever
again be called the Bengali ; therefore to continue to call our
little domesticated bird in its Guinea-pig colours a &amp;quot; Bengalee&apos;&apos;
will certainly be far less confusing than the entirely different
application of the trivial names Mauuikiu and Manakin, the
former for the Munia group of Ploceidce, the latter for the Tit-like
Pipridce ; or the manifold application of the term Sparrow to birds
of all t)&apos;pes from an Accentor to a Grass-finch.
Is it advisable to give names to the more or less stable
domesticated sports of fanciers&apos; birds? If we accept scientific
names for the three varieties of the Bengalee, why should we not
equally propose names for all the known sports of the domes-
tic Canary, of the Rock-pigeon, and of the inhabitants of our
poultry-yards? And that will not be the end, for all the domestic
races of Mammalia and the Chinese fish-abortions will have to-
come in ! It is too terrible to contemplate with serenity.

COLOUR-CHANGE IN FEATHERS.

Sir, — In your current issue you have a short notice on Mr. Beebe&apos;s
article on the American Laughing Gull in the last number of the &apos; Auk.&apos;
Judging from this individual bird, and brushing aside rather contemptuous-
ly the idea that in 1906 there could still be found any ornithologists who
believe in &apos; colour-change,&apos; Mr. Beebe, as if to put the finishing touch on an
already moribund belief, states that colour-change is impossible.

I fear, Sir, that your reviewer was rather led away by Mr. Beebe&apos;s
positive bluster, for the fact that a single individual has moulted can by no
stretch of imagination be called overwhelming proof. Because I have not
published anything on this subject since my paper in the &apos;Ibis&apos; for 1900, I
am by no means the less certain that colour-change does take place, nor
have I ceased to accumulate careful notes of every occurrence that has
come under my observation. I have not had the opportunity of observing
the change on the American Laughing Gull, but have repeatedly done so
on our native and nearly-allied species, L.ridibundus. If a number of these
birds be taken in February and March, especially in the earlier half of the
latter month, the colour of the feathers of the head will, in an overwhelm-
ing percentage of individuals, be found to be much darker than in an equal
number of birds taken during the earlier months of the winter. The
earlier birds will all be found very uniform, showing a pure white head with
darker patches near each eye and ear-covert; the February and March
birds, on the other hand, will show a large amount of individual variation,
some being very nearly as in winter, others showing two dark crescentic
bars from eye to eye and ear to ear, while in others again the wholeof the
back of the head will be of a dark sooty brown. If these birds be shot and
the skins examined, both inside and out, no trace of new growing feathers
will be found, and if this alteration is not caused by colour-change I should
like to hear Mr. Beebe&apos;s explanation of it.
So much for wild shot birds : now let us turn to birds in confinement,
where this species does extremely well, and what do we find ? In February
and March the birds can be observed getting darker day by day. I have re-
peatedly observed this in many individuals; gradually the black colour-
spreads across the head from the eye- and ear-patches till we get two black
crescentic bars; the space between these bars then gets darker, and finally
the dark colour creeps forward towards the cuhnen, the whole change
taking place in about ten days or a fortnight, and during that time, how-
ever closely the bird ma}&apos; be examined, no 11 eiv feathers appear.
The change is, however, not as a rule complete, although it is ex-
ceptional!}* so, as in an instance I had this year, but, as a rule, the colour-
change stops short of completeness, a few white feathers are left and the
dark colour is not so intense as in a full-plumaged bird. In this condition
it will remain for two or three weeks, and then supervenes the moult of
which the Americans are never tired of telling us. I have restricted my-
self to the Black-headed Gull, but precisely similar changes are found in
some Waders and doubtless in many other species.
Although it is the twentieth century (to paraphrase Mr. Beebe) I am
not alone in my belief of colour-change as an interesting note on the
Herring-Gull from the pen of Dr. Gadow in the &apos; Field&apos; for Nov. 24th will
show. That a feather, although fully grown is not dead, was clearly shown
at the last meeting of the Zoological Societv, where I exhibited a-Kuo±!s^

feather belonging to the summer plumage which, instead of falling out at
the autumn moult, had merely continued to grow, the basal half being of
the autumn plumage.
Finally, ma)^ I try to impress on Mr. Beebe and other Americans that
proof of a moult is no disproof of colour-change, and ask them to attack
this fact, which they deny, from another and more scientific standpoint.
J. Lewis Bonhote.
[In the notice, above referred to, we merely stated the result of Mr.
Beebe&apos;s observations, very carefully carried out, of a single example of
Larus atricilla, in which there certainly appeared to be no doubt whatever
that no actual colour-change took place ; nevertheless we would not for
one moment state that colour-change in feathers never occurs, in fact Mr.
Bonhote, Dr. Gadow, Dr. Butler, and others have published evidence
tending to show that it does. It is a very interesting and important subject,
necessitating the most minute observation, and we hope that it will be
thoroughly thrashed out in our Magazine. Ed.].

Sir, — If you think my remarks worth publication perhaps they will
add to the testimony of others, and show Mr. Attewell that there need be
no cruelty in keeping foreign birds in outdoor avairies that are properly
constructed.
I have now watched ni}&apos; birds both in heat and cold for some con-
siderable time, and I find that several of them that will remain indoors
most of the day will do all they can to roost outside at night. A pair of
Crimson Wings are almost impossible to drive in at night, even at this time
of year, if there is no wind.
A pair of Varied Lorikeets, though they remain indoors a good deal,
alwa3&apos;S fly outside and remain out a considerable time on the coldest morn-
ings. Then take the Violet Neck Lories, which I suppose come from
nearly the hottest part of the world ; during the late summer they hardly
ever showed outside on a hot day, but as the weather became cooler they
came out more and more, and even now they ate out of doors a good deal,
sometimes in very cold rain.
The fact is that, in very hot climates the mornings, before sunrise, are
often very chilly and cold, and the birds are well provided by nature against
these sudden chills.
How often one sees birds that have been kept in cages in warm
rooms improve greatly in spirits and plumage when carefully introduced to
a cool aviary. By all means give birds a chance of a warm inner room if
they wish to use it, but let them have a chance of a fly in the outer aviary,
and it will astonish many, who do not know the fact, how often birds from

A PISCATORIAL THRUSH.
Sik, — At Oxford last August I had the opportunity of making an
observation which very much surprised me. I was standing on the small
stone bridge which crosses the stream partly skirting Magdalen College,
when I saw on the edge a Song-Thrush looking for food. A shoal of small
fish (minnows, apparently) were swimming close in shore, and the thought
struck me — could that bird catch one ?
The same idea had evidently occurred to the Thrush, for at that
instant, with a sudden dart forward, it seized an unwary fishling, and after
a nip and a rap on two or the gravel, swallowed it with gusto. The capture
was so quickly made that I had no chance to see how far the bird went in,
but it afterwards went further along looking for more food, and I saw it did
not mind getting its feet wet.
The incident struck me as interesting, both because one seldom sees
the .Song-Thrush do anything original, and also because it gave one some
idea as to how the Dipper may have begun his business as an aquatic
Thrush in ages past. F. Finn.

Sir, — I see in the report of the Council it is wished all interesting
observations should be recorded. I do not know if the doings of my hen
Cactus Conure would come under that head.
The cock died two years ago, and for a time the hen was quite
miserable, moping and calling. Then she became devoted to me, flying to
me whenever I came into the aviary in a kind of ecstas}&apos;, and I had the
greatest difficulty to get away. This year she made friends with an odd
young Cockatiel cock and gradually dropped me, becoming quite shy. The
Cockatiel never seemed much gratified, in fact rather bored, with her
attentions. About July I missed her, and after looking everywhere found
her in a log nest with six white eggs about the size of a Cockatiel&apos;s. She
sat most steadily, the Cockatiel taking no part in the task of incubation,
but he was most attentive as a guard, driving away his parents in the most
noisy way whenever they came anywhere near the nest. I allowed her to
sit for a time, but none of the eggs were fertile. Do you suppose there is
an)&apos; hope of a hybrid between these two species?
I see in our Editor&apos;s delightful book on Parrakeets that there is no
record of Cactus Couures being bred in this country. I have tried in vain
to procure a cock. Meanwhile I suppose I had better leave them together,
though at the breeding season I must move them from the old Cockatiels,
whose breeding this year was entirely ruined by their sou&apos;s anxieties over^,
the Conure nest. M. Drummond.

PRIVET BERRIES AS FOOD FOR BIRDS.

Sir, — I have lately been to Southport, and made a special effort to
visit the Aviary of birds at Hesketh Park. I found them all in a very satis-
factory condition and looking well. The man in charge told me they lost
very few of the more delicate kind of birds last winter. They seem to feed
the birds a good deal on privet berries. Is this good food for them ? They
also give the birds the fat of meat. Wirj.lAM B. Gibbins.

AN OMNIVOROUS BUSTARD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99833971875" page_id="33229072"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I have just had the misfortune to lose by death a young pet
Bustard, and think perhaps the following particulars may be of interest.
I picked him up on September 9th, while on Safari, he was then about
three days old. For the following five days I was on the move, sometimes
on train, sometimes riding camel or mule, during which time he lived in
my coat pocket and was fed on egg and grasshoppers (forcibly given as he
would not pick up for himself). Once, while riding a camel, he fell out of
my pocket but seemed none the worse for it. The day I got back, he
started feeding himself, and from that time gave no trouble at all. He had
perfect liberty except at night, and became delightfully tame and followed
me about, calling plaintively all the while for &amp;quot; locusts.&amp;quot; He would always
come to my whistle and usually ran out some distance to meet me when I
came in from my morning and afternoon rounds. Recently he has had a
companion, a baby Egyptian Goose. It was very funny to see the latter
toddling after the Bustard and snuggling up to him when he sat down
and at night creeping in under the Bustard&apos;s wing.
Ordinary food did not satisfy the Bustard, he was always trying to
swallow my bootlaces, and one day I saw him swallow a gramophone
needle. That made me nervous about him, I may now say with good cause.
Three days ago he seemed unhappy and was a bit lame. I picked him up
and in doing so felt something sharp prick my hand, and on examination
found a pin (entomological) sticking out just behind his leg ; this I pulled
out with forceps, and a few hours later I found and extracted another pin
behind the other leg ; this time he bled profusely and lost all strength. He
hung on for two days and then died. A P. M. of stomach revealed one
bootlace 19^ ins. long, one piece 13 ins. ; a fish hook \ in. long, two
gramophone needles and a feather some 3 ins., and a \ in. piece of wire
All this in addition to the two pins that had worked out through the sides
of the stomach.
It is most disheartening. My last bird, a Roller, was killed by a
snake, before that some young geese were taken by a fox.

Sir, — I have not much to record in breeding for 1906. Eight
Diamond Doves reared. The Mealy Rosellas nested but the hen became
egg-bound when laying her fourth egg. Pennants hatched and partly
reared two young; Java Sparrows reared three young; Diamond Finches,
one young. A large quantity of 3&apos;oung Budgerigars, green and yellow, and

TREATMENT OF WADERS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999191696969697" page_id="33229073"  page_num="107" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I should be much obliged by information as to how to get the
feathers of Waders to resist water. I sometimes have sent me by dealers
Waders whose feathers will not resist water in the least and have lost
several birds through this cause.
I usually put such birds into a place by themselves on arrival, aud
allow them to bathe for a few minutes oul}&apos; each day, hoping that the
feathers will in time get back the oil.
At the present time, I have a Greeushank which was sent me a week
ago. It was, aud is, apparently in good health except after getting wet,
when it is a shivering, trembling mass, hardly to be recognised. It feeds on
earth worms, mealworms and Victoria poultry meal, and I have placed a
temporary shelter from rain for the present. Unless, however, I can get the
feathers to turn water I am confident that sooner or later a lot of cold rain
will kill it. I have lost several birds lately through this cause — birds that I
have had for months and that have grown aud got fat during such time
and yet the feathers never got to turn water.
On the other hand I sometimes get birds from dealers that have been
kept away from water for mouths, and }&apos;et they never give an)&apos; trouble.
As I am much interested in wading birds I should be very glad of
am&apos; suggestion throwing light upon the question.
I have a little swamp aviary in which I keep a Black-tailed Godwit,
Ruff and other small Waders, and should like to have a Water-Rail if it
would be likely to succeed. I have a lot of water-snails, etc., also a good
deal of cover in the way of rushes, flag grass and low bushes.
I suppose the bird would have to be fed on raw meat or liver ? Would
it be likely to attack Dunlins, etc. ? I understand that Land-Rails are very
savage, but do not know if Water-Rails are. C. Barnby Smith.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Barnby Smith : —
Waders once on their food will generally do fairly well until the
moult sets in when their plumage holds the water as you describe. Birds
fresh caught from dealers always or almost always have this trouble with
the exception of Ruffs or Knots which seem very hard}&apos;. As birds-iu-this^
condition have generally not finished their moult I find invariably that

<bodyText confidence="0.991782688888889" page_id="33229074"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
they never get right until the moult is completed which is sometimes not
until the next spring. Your feeding — earthworms, mealworms and poultiy
meal is fairly right, but these birds really require a far more mixed diet.
Mine have as staple food Spratt&apos;s Game Meal and in addition to this a little
hard boiled egg, bread crumb and scraped beef, and twice a week a little
bread and milk instead of the egg.
A little fish cut up very small once a day is undoubtedly beneficial
especially for the larger kinds such as Curlews and Oyster-catchers.
Above all things, however, the great essential for Waders in captivity
is shelter from damp, especially wind-driven rain, and in my opinion shelter
during the Winter months is a sine qua non. At the same time if they
&apos;hang&apos; in their moult, they should be forced through it by extra food and
perhaps by taking them into an artificially heated house in July.
Now as regards these freshly caught birds; they should be kept in a
covered-in place, if possible indoors, and in any case carefully sheltered
from wind ; bread and milk is the best staple food for them with hard
boiled egg and scraped beef. Give them the bread and milk in the morn-
ing and hard-boiled egg in the afternoon as the milk does not then turn
sour, earthworms or mealworms as many as you like and a little fish, if
convenient, will be greatly appreciated.
As regards water you must be guided by their condition, the}&apos; are best
with verj&apos; little water; about a quarter-of-an-iuch at the bottom of a broad
pan is better than a small cup full so that when you increase the water
they do not rush at it with the same avidity. At the end of a week if they
are going on well }&apos;ou might fill up the pan one morning and let them
bathe, but if they do not dry up by the afternoon they should be gently
dried with a towel and the water, in any case, removed. If after the bath
they dry up satisfactorily the water may after a day or two be left all the
time, but continue to keep them well fed up. After a fortnight if they are
doing well the bread and milk may be gradually dropped, i.e. given once
every other day and then once in three days, and game meal take its place;
but it must not be reduced in quantity and given with the game meal at
first, or they will disregard the meal and go back from insufficient bread aud
milk. If they are now going on nicely they will not need much further
attention, but if their wings are cut, as is often the case when sent by
dealers, the cut quills should be removed as soon as you are sure they are
strong enough but certainly not for a month or six weeks after their arrival.
It is essential if Waders are to be kept in health that they should have the
use of their wings. If the quills are pulled too soon before the bird has
strength to grow new ones the wound will very likely close up and the
new feather, when it does grow, being unable to force its way out, the
wing will become permanently diseased.
I am afraid you may think all this a tremendous amount of un-
necessary trouble and not be able to undertake it all, but that is the only
method by which one can be moderately certain of success.

The late Dr. W. T. Greene. 109
I hardly know what to suggest if this involves too much time and
trouble; shelter is absolutely indispensible, poultry meal and earthworms
are probably as good as game meal and, until they get really strong, egg and
scraped meat is essential. They might do without the bread and milk but it
is a very valuable adjunct, and fish is not essential but certainly useful during
the moult, and I might mention that some Greenshanks I shot this autumn
were apparently feeding on nothing but small fish. As regards the water and
the removing the cut primaries you will, of course, use your discretion, but
if you are not certain when to remove the quills err on the side of leaving
them for some time longer and in any case do not remove them unless the
bird is iu good condition. If a bird that has beeu well gets seedy it is
probably due to suppressed moult and shelter, warmth and good feeding is
the remedy, but the greatest of these is shelter. Waders do best in a
covered-in aviary facing south, the bottom being partly sand and partly turf,
and in winter part of the sand should be covered for an inch or two in moss
litter or moderately short straw.
The}&apos; are delightful birds, if a little trouble be taken with them, but
they require attention. If I can give you any more information please
write and ask.
As regards Rails, they should be treated in much the same way as
Waders, but they are hardier, although not being found in this country
during the winter (the Water Rail excepted), they must, of course, be
sheltered from rain and wind, but artificial heat is not required.
I kept them tor some years in my small aviary where the}&apos; did well on
the ordinary .soft food, which includes eggs, breadcrumb and meat, as well
as mixed seeds of which they also partook. As a rule they are quite
harmless and peaceful to the other birds, and I have only known them to
become dangerous when given insufficient animal food.

THE LATE DR. W. T. GREENE.
Parrots in Captivity is a work which 111 ay be found in the
bookshelves of Bird-Lovers throughout the length and breadth
of the land ; and not a few of our readers will be sorry to hear
that its genial author passed away on December 10, at his
residence iu Dunstable, on coming in from a walk on that cold
day, suddenly and unexpectedly, but painlessly and peacefully
as one feels is fitting in the case of one who has spent not only a
long and busy but also a good life, and is at peace with his
Maker. In days long since gone by, at least so it seems scTTasfT
does time flit past, many were the books on foreign and British

birds which fell from his facile and graceful pen. Moreover, for
many years he was the main supporter in this department of The
Feathered World ; and his connection in the same branch with
The Bazaar was, if I mistake not, maintained until the day of
his death. Thus it came about that his name was, and, indeed,
still is, a household word, far and wide, in the mouths of
thousands upon thousands of aviculturists — mostly embryonic
it may be for these advanced days, tyros who may be looked
down upon with scorn by the modern &amp;quot;scientist,&amp;quot; but who,
nevertheless, form the body of the multitude who keep birds.
Some of us, in our wisdom, thought him out of date, quite
forgetting that in his time foreign bird keeping was practicall}&apos;
in its infancy. He it was who laid the foundation ; and we,
upstarts of but yesterday, rear our superstructure on the
foundation which was laid by him years before we were even
heard of. The Bird World is greatly in his debt ; — and, in my
opinion at any rate, it is no exaggeration to say that no one has
done more to popularize the keeping of foreign birds in this
country, and to make so familiar to us a great number of foreign
species, as Dr. W. T. Greene, who has now at last laid down his
well-worn pen. Reginald Phillipps.

By the Rev. Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Until I possessed a Lear&apos;s Macaw I must confess to not
having appreciated the members of this family overmuch.
I have known individual Blue and Yellow Macaws and Red
and Yellow ones too which were most untrustworthy and spite-
ful, I might say malicious to everyone but their owners, or almost
everyone. And this spitefulness they show outwardly, with their
flattened heads aud wicked-looking eyes. They are splendid for
colour, but personally I do not appreciate them as pets.
The Lear&apos;s Macaw on the other hand (and I believe the
Hyacinthine is much the same) is naturally a bird with a kindly
disposition. One is led to think so, if only from his outward
appearance ; his deep brown Cockatoo-like eyes and his large
rounded soft looking head give one confidence to at any rate offer
to stratch his poll, if he is a stranger to one. Comparisons are
not fair I know, but I cannot appreciate the naked skin of the
Red and Yellow Macaw&apos;s faces and also of the Blue and Yellow,
after being more used to the Lear&apos;s Macaws with their faces well
and respectably covered, and only enough bare skin of a splendid
orange-yellow to enhance the peacock blue-green of the sur-
rounding feathers. I think it is some colour very near that.
Peacock blue-green upon the whole head and under-parts, the
rest of the plumage being of a fine blue : of quite a different
shade to that in the Blue and Yellow Macaw or the Hyacinthine
either.
It is an extremely good blue, bright without being glaring.
Then I like the black bill, with the tongue within so curiously

coloured : black with a yellow stripe down each side of it, to
carry on the yellow of the bare patches of skin at the corners of
the month. These patches are of a lighter yellow than the skin
around the eyes, which is more orange in tint. The feet and legs
also are black (or what one calls black) and the toes are long and
well shaped. Indeed, as my Italian servant said to me about the
Lear&apos;s Macaw I have in Italy, &amp;quot;e proprio un papagallo signorile,&amp;quot;
— a real gentleman amongst parrots, an aristocrat.
The Lear&apos;s Macaws can make themselves heard, no doubt
about that, but it is a voice of a much less strident ear-piercing
tone than that of the vari-coloured large Macaws : it has more
of the Carrion-Crow &apos;timbre&apos; in it.
As to intelligence, I consider them most highly intelligent
birds. One of mine, the one I know best, for I have not seen
much of the other two, shows joy at seeing me and having a
game of play, more keenly than any bird I have ever met with.
He simply entreats me to take him off his perch, stretching out
first one foot and then the other, and trying to feed me. He
loves a game with a handkerchief. It is thrown right on to his
head, covering it completely up, upon - which he proceeds to
dance up and down in great glee, and at last either dances it off,
or else pulls it off with one claw, holding it, and then laughing
loudly and in a most human way ; waiting for the fun to be
commenced all over again.
If he is put on a table, and I sit on a chair close by, he
backs over the edge of the table with a foot waving round to find
a foothold on my knees, and will return again and again however
often he is displaced. He spreads his wings out froni the
shoulders with the ends of the wings kept in place, and whispers
and &amp;quot;purrs,&amp;quot; stretching out his neck and cocking his head on
one side.
He can articulate too. &amp;quot; Cockatoo&amp;quot; he can say very plainly
in a tiny voice, and &amp;quot;Ara,&amp;quot; etc., and he can imitate duckings and
various sounds that go towards making up the vocabulary of
one&apos;s bird talk.
As to his food ; I need say nothing much about that, ex-
cept that he likes sun-flower seed chiefly, with apple, banana or
pear in the morning, and at five o&apos;clock tea he always has some

&amp;quot; Albert&amp;quot; or &amp;quot; Marie&amp;quot; biscuit, soaked in hot milk, and given not
too moist.
It is a curious fact that none of the authorities in Europe
seem to know from what part of South America the Lear&apos;s
Macaw is brought. It is probably somewhere in Brazil, for they
are brought from the ports of Bahia, Santos and Rio de Janeiro.
I have asked Herr Carl Hagenbeck, who wrote to me : —
&amp;quot; I made enquiries about the L,ear&apos;s Macaws, and I also cannot find
&amp;quot;the exact place from where the birds come. When we get these
&amp;quot; birds, they come from Bahia, Santos and Rio : to which places
&amp;quot; they are brought from the interior. This is all the information
&amp;quot;I can give about them.&amp;quot;
So they probably inhabit some of the great forests in the
heart of Brazil, and a few young birds are reared from the nest,
and carried to the ports on the coast.
If there is a Macaw like this who can be possessed, and
yet whose habitat is unknown, how very possible that there may
be a Macaw who has never been possessed and whose habitat is
still more in the background ! Let us hope so.

Munia casta7ieithorax.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
I propose to combine my notes on the breeding of these
two nearly allied species in the hope that they may thus prove
more interesting. There is another and equally good reason,
namely that recently the question has frequently been asked
whether these two species are really specifically distinct. When
I first saw a specimen of M. flaviprymna in the Zoological
Gardens in March, 1905, I was strongly inclined to regard it as
only a variant form of M. castaneithorax ; but, on making this
suggestion to a well known ornithological authority, I was^told.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.99295735" page_id="33229086"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
ii4 Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
that M. flaviptymna was &amp;quot; undoutedly a distinct species.&amp;quot;
Gould, in describing the original specimen, obtained by Dr.
Bynoe during the voyage of the &amp;quot; Beagle &amp;quot; in 1839, said : &amp;quot; It is
very nearly allied to the Donacola castaneithorax but is specifically
distinct from that as well as from every known species of this
now numerous tribe of birds.&amp;quot;
Quite recently, however, a very curious fact has been
noted in connection with this species, which would appear to
throw some doubt on the above statement, namely that some of
the Yellow-rumped Finches imported at the commencement of
this year have begun to change colour, developing black or
brown throats with more or less distinct traces of a chestnut
band across the chest, while others (e.g. one in the Parrot
House in the Zoological Gardens) show the latter variation with-
out the dark throat. Now, if this happened in only one or two-
isolated instances, it might well have been regarded (or
disregarded) as a &amp;quot; sport ; &amp;quot; but, on making further enquiries, I
was surprised to find that the number of instances in which this
strange permutation of colour had occurred amounted to perhaps
two per cent, of the total number of living specimens now in
the country.
It is evident therefore that a mystery surrounds the
identity of the Yellow-rumped Finch and one which, before
going further, it will be interesting to discuss.
Most of our members will remember the enormous
importation of over 5,000 Australian Finches brought over by
Messrs. Payne and Wallace in the early part of 1906. I was in.
London at the time and had the pleasure not only of seeing this.
wonderful collection, but also of having a talk with Mr. Payne.
In this way I obtained from him some particulars of the wild
life of M. flavip7&apos;ymna, and I recently applied to him again to see
if he could throw any light on this question. Mr. Payne has
very kindly consented to set down his views on paper for the
benefit of our members and I think they are worthy of the closest
consideration, not only because Mr. Payne has an experience of
many years&apos; duration as an actual trapper, but also because
no one can talk with him for five minutes without coming to the
conclusion that his opinion, on any matters connected with.
Australian birds, is an exceedingly valuable one.

o?i Nesting of Yellow-rutnped and Chestnut-breasted Finches. 115
His letter is written from &amp;quot; Lyncornbe Hill, Bath,&amp;quot; under
date October 8th, and runs as follows : —
&amp;quot; In reply to your favour we have much pleasure in
&amp;quot;supplying you with a few facts regarding the Yellow-rumped
&amp;quot; Finch. This bird has been known only a few years. During
&amp;quot;our twenty-five years of collecting in the whole of Australia
&amp;quot; it was not until five years ago that we found this finch. We
&amp;quot;firmly believe that this bird is a distinct species from the
&amp;quot; Chestnut Finch — because the Yellow-rump is purely a desert
&amp;quot; bird and only comes to the parts where the Chestnut Finches
&amp;quot; congregate when it is an exceptionally dry season. It lives
&amp;quot;chiefly in the Northern Territories — about 300 miles from our
&amp;quot;.headquarters (Wyudham). Until last year we were never
&amp;quot; successful in catching more than ten pairs, but last year they
&amp;quot; were very plentiful. We brought to England 500 pairs and, if
&amp;quot; we liked, could have brought 5,000. But in the trapping they
&amp;quot; kept to themselves and we very seldom found many other birds
&amp;quot; in the same nets. If any, it was generally Pectoralis. We have
&amp;quot; quite a dozen of these dark-throated birds and firmly believe it
&amp;quot; is only a freak that this mark should appear. We are of
&amp;quot; opinion that the dark patch increases in size after each moult-
&amp;quot; ing. Some of our birds not only have the dark patch but also
&amp;quot; the bar across the chest.
&amp;quot;Now the Chestnut Finch is a bird that is scattered all
&amp;quot;over Australia, but is always rare where the Yellow-rumped
&amp;quot;Finch is found. This is why we think them distinct species.
&amp;quot;The first five pairs we brought to England were sold to ;
&amp;quot; we also sold one pair at Genoa together with a pair of Emblema
&amp;quot; picta and a pair of Yellow-headed Gouldians. Truly this was a
&amp;quot; rare trio ! The Yellow-rump is as little known in Australia as
&amp;quot; it is in England. Up till three years ago there was only one
&amp;quot; Museum in Australia that possessed a skin, and that was the
&amp;quot; Perth Museum. We find that this is the hardiest of all
&amp;quot; Australian birds.
&amp;quot; As we said before, there is so little known of this bird
&amp;quot;that time will have to elapse before the &apos;mystery&apos; will be
&amp;quot; cleared. There are birds in Australia that take two and
&amp;quot; three years to get their true colours. We sold a pair— of^

n6 Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
&amp;quot;Yellow-rumps to a gentleman in Sydney (N.S.W.) three years
&amp;quot;ago and the last time I was there (about a year ago) they were
&amp;quot; still Yellow-rumps. Climatic changes and the change of diet
&amp;quot;also have a lot to do with the change of feather. We have a
&amp;quot;few Bichenos that have moulted off with the bauds nearly
&amp;quot;obliterated by black feathering, when there should be pure
&amp;quot;white. &amp;quot;Payne and Wallace.&amp;quot;
One fact stands out very clearly, I think, in this interesting
letter; and that is that the Yellow-rumped Finch does not
inhabit the same districts as the Chestnut Finch. It is clear that
the former is a bird of the desert and we at once see a reason for
its buff colouring, which would be very inconspicuous in a bare
sandy country. Mr. Payne also gives us a good reason for this
species being compelled to leave its home in the great wilderness
of the far interior namely — drought. If we recall the fact that
from 1899 to 1904 a great and — even for that thirsty land —
unprecedented drought was experienced over an enormous area
of Western and North-Western Australia, and that the last year
of this drought coincided with the appearance of the Yellow-
rumped Finch in the districts near the coast, we can better
understand how it came about that a species, of which, in the
sixty-five years following its discovery, only a single specimen
reached this country (viz., that obtained by Mr. J. R. Elsie in
1856), became, in the short space of a year, a drug in the
market.
We can now perhaps clear the air a little by summarizing
what we have definitely ascertained about M. flaviprymna.
(i). We have learned that M. flaviprymna is a desert
species ;
(ii). That it does not normally associate with M.
castaneithorax ;
(iii). That a certain small proportion (estimated by
me at two per cent.) of the former species, assume certain of
the characteristic markings of the latter, in a greater or less
degree ;
(iv). But that by far the larger proportion have not
undergone any change during the time they have been
under observation in captivity. Dr. Butler writes me that
</bodyText>

on Nesting of Yellow-rumped and Chestnut- breasted Finches, nj
he has ten individuals, none of which have changed colour.
I have had seven. One of my birds has been in my
possession for eighteen months, during which time it has
undergone three moults but has not changed. Mr. Payne
refers to a pair which have been two years in captivity in
their own country, but &amp;quot; are still Yellow-rumps.&amp;quot;
(v). As I shall subsequently show, a young Chestnut-
breasted Finch, bred in my aviary this summer, was, at six
weeks old, absolutely distinct from young Yellow-rumps
of the same age, showing already the chestnut breast.
I expect that we can now most of us make a shrewd guess
as to the solution of this little problem. I think we shall not be
far from the truth if we assume that these are distinct species,
compelled to associate by a chance circumstance ; and that the
dark-throated birds are wild hybrids, showing their mixed
parentage after the first moult.
Of course the keystone of this argument is missing, viz., a
hybrid bred in captivity. Surely some of our 428 members will
supply this desideratum next season.
I will now give some notes on the nesting of M. flavi-
prymna with me this summer. I unfortunately lost the hen that
so nearly succeeded in winning a medal in 1905, so I started this
season with the same male bird and the old hen which last year
built but did not lay, I also obtained two pairs imported by one
of our members early this year. The latter were turned out in
the larger aviary, the former in the small &amp;quot; Waxbills&apos; aviary.&amp;quot;
This season has been quite an &amp;quot; Australian year&amp;quot; with me.
One can well understand that the long sunny days of this
wonderful Halcyon summer have suited the Australian species
well but what there can have been attractive to them in the
unusually cold inclement spring I cannot understand. Never-
theless I had young Ruficaudas, Grassfinches, Diamond Doves,
and one young Yellow-rump flying by the middle of May and
all bred in the open.
The Yellow-rumps (one of the newly-imported pairs) sat
in a small nest box hanging on the wire netting, from which, on
May 14th, two young flew. The first sight of a young Flavi-
pryimia is calculated to make one rub one&apos;s eyes and wonder if-ene-&amp;quot;

n8 Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
has seen aright. Naturally one expects to see a yellowish object,
but what one really sees is a little bird whose head, throat, back,
and tail are dark brown, chest dull grey, with a short stumpy
beak, dark horn colour, with small white warts in the angles.
These particular young Flaviprymnas were tiny little mites
(those I saw in the nest in 1905 were large strong birds) aud had
evidently been launched too soon upon a shivering world. For
May the 14th was a wet and rather cold day„ aud as it drew
towards evening and the old birds made no attempt to get the
young back to their nest box, I began to speculate what their fate
would be. The youngsters were sitting, huddled up and quite
incapable of flying more than a very short distance, in a low bush
not more than two feet from the ground, whereas the nest box was
quite six feet from the ground. To me it appeared a sheer im-
possibility for them to reach the nest again but, just as twilight
began to fall, I saw a most interesting sight. Both the old birds
flew up to the nest and began to call loudly. Instantly the young
commenced to scramble up to the top of the shrub. The strongest
one then jumped off on to the wire netting and began to crawl
up like a little mouse, using its feet chiefly. But, alas! long
before it reached the nest its strength gave out and it fell to the
ground. Again the parents called it, aud again it fell. Then
they tried different tactics, and after prolonged efforts got both
the young up to the top of a tall Cupressus which, though further
from the nest, was on the same level with it. Then the hen flew
into the nest box and, putting her head out of the entrance hole,
called her very loudest. Her child made a most gallant effort
and launched himself bravely into the air, but he just failed and
again fell to earth.
But the old birds never despaired. They began to push
the young, which would now hardly make any effort, from branch
to branch. Sometimes they pushed them right off so that they
fell to the ground again, but they never left them alone for a
single instant. The way they toiled and toiled aud scolded and
exhorted those young birds was absolutely human.
At last they got one to the very topmost twig of an elder
sapling several feet from the nest but well above it. Then one
flew to the nest and called, and the other gave the youngster a

mighty push from behind. The latter made one final effort, just
barely reached the alighting perch and sprang with one bound
into the nest. The delight of these two old birds was good to
see. If some of those who teach the doctrine of the &amp;quot; unconscious
intelligence&amp;quot; of birds could have seen this little episode I think
it would have given them cause to reflect !
On May 15th I left home with a friend, a camera, and a
small motor-launch to make the acquaintance of the Great
Crested Grebe and the Bearded Tit in their homes in Broad-laud.
On my return (May 28th) there was only one young Flaviprymna
but he was to be seen flying about and very fit until the end of
September, when I missed him.
The same pair of birds laid again but did not hatch, and
the other newly-imported pair hatched but did not rear the
young.
We will now turn to the original pair in the Waxbills&apos;
aviary. This species seems to moult (in this country) twice a
year — the spring moult taking place at some time between the
middle of April and the end of May, and the autumn moult
between the middle of October and the end of November. It
follows then that, unless M. flavipry??ma goes to nest quite early
in the season, no nesting is likely to occur until quite late in the
summer. It was not until the last week in July that this pair
built (again in a nest box). I think these were quite old birds.
The late Dr. Russ is said to have succeeded best with young
birds but, as far as my experience goes, older birds seem often to
do very well. They lose something in point of vigour no doubt
but they have a great pull in the matter of experience. No
doubt a combination of the two would be best.
&amp;quot;Si jeunesse savait;
Si vieillese pouvait.&amp;quot;
This old hen only laid two eggs (usual clutch four) but two
smart little birds left the nest on August 19th. As this aviary is
so small I was able to get accurate notes of the change of colour ;
and I will now give some of these notes as nearly as possible
verbatim.
Aug. 19. The young Flavis are studies in brown ; they
are so dark on the crown and round the beak as to look blackish^--&apos;
but no doubt there are some sheath feathers here.

</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.964047162162162" page_id="33229092"  page_num="120" year="" vol="">
like young Zebra Finches, standing beside the parent and twist-
ing their heads round ; not fluttering their wings.
Aug. 24. They are changing colour rapidly: the brown
on head and back is much lighter, nearly inouse-colour, but
every feather has a darker stripe along the shaft as though the
colour faded from the outer web first. Tails square ended and
brown. Breast getting somewhat buff. At a little distance they
now look somewhat buff.
Aug. 25. The young Flavis flying well. They are now
almost buff: the brown has faded away completely, except a little
on primaries : heads rather streaky ; in other respects they look
rather like fawn Bengalese.
Aug. 26. They are now all buff except a patch (light
brown) on back of neck and some primaries. Head and cheeks
streaky.
Sept. 4. Feeding themselves and calling &amp;quot; pink.&amp;quot;
Sept. 13 — Oct. 4. No notes (away from home).
Oct. 5. Breasts a much lighter buff; beaks now the same
colour as adults ; one singing.
Oct. 11. Some black feathers have begun to show in the
under tail coverts ; and some whitish and streaky feathers on
their heads and cheeks.
Oct. 18. The young Flavis are now moulting and casting
a lot of feathers.
Oct. 25. One youngster through the moult. The chief
change is in the colour of the wings : the scapulars, primaries,
and some secondaries are now a rich brown umber. They now
show the yellow rump, but the colour does not extend so far up
the back as in adults. Some black feathers in lower part of
thighs.
Dec. 10. They are now exactly like the adults except the
under tail-coverts which are black in patches only, and a few
secondaries still light brown. They pass most of their time in
gnawing and devouring the shrubs.
So much for the young Yellow-rumps. The parents began
to sit again on two eggs on Sept. 5. I should not have allowed
them to do so if I had not been most anxious to ascertain the

period of incubation. The nest was examined daily (during my
absence) and the hen was fonnd dead on the 14th, eggsuukatched
but incubation well advanced.
I have examined eleven eggs of this species and about the
same number of M. castaneithorax and find them identical in size
and shape, but the former appear to be more glossy. The shape
is quite peculiar, being much elongated, the smaller end tapering
gradually to a fine point, resembling in this respect the egg of
the Guillemot.
After the death of the hen, the male bird made up to a
widowed Chestnut Finch, which fact leads me to think- that it
would not be difficult to produce hybrids. At the same time it
should be noted that, although I had this season four of the
former species and two of the latter in one aviary, and in the
other, two of the former and four of the latter, there was no
attempt at interbreeding as long as each could find a partner of
its own species. I think this supports my argument as to the
stability of M. flaviprytnna as a species.
I feel sure that this species in a state of liberty rears its
young on insect food, for which, as soon as the young are hatched,
the parents are seen searching all day long and even hawking
flies. I have seen as many as six gentles carried to the nest at
one time.
Nesting Notes on Mtmia castaneithorax.
By request of our Editor I will now give some notes on
this species, the nesting of which does not seem to have been
described, though there is evidence that it has nested success-
fully. In this connection our Editor has very kindly drawn my
attention to the following passage in Gedney&apos;s &amp;quot; Foreign Cage
Birds, Vol. II., p. 61 : — &amp;quot; They have, however, bred once with
me, and other instances have come to my knowledge, but the
progeny seldom do well.&amp;quot;
It is singular that, although this species has been imported
in thousands and has been in every aviary in the laud, I have not
yet been able to find a quite definite statement as to the young
having been fully reared. As it would be interesting to know
how often it has been done, perhaps our members would kfrrdly— -

122 Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
consult their note books or memories. Dr. Russ had one brood
(as quoted by Dr. Butler in &amp;quot; Foreign Finches &amp;quot;) but &amp;quot;they did
not survive the change of colour.&amp;quot;
As a general rule this species seems quite disinclined to
nest at all. A friend of mine, however, who has spent seven
years in Australia, tells me that it is a mistake to assume that the
birds in many districts of that great continent breed regularly
every year. He maintains that nesting depends chiefly on the
question of rainfall, and that you may spend several seasons in
one district, in a time of drought, and see very few birds and still
fewer nests. Suddenly the rain comes. What was before an
arid desert quickly becomes a green oasis ; birds are seen in
numbers and nests everywhere. If this is correct, it perhaps
explains why Australian birds in captivity are so uncertain both
as to the time of year they may select for nesting and as to
whether they condescend to nest at all.
This has certainly been one of their nesting years in my
aviary. From three pairs of castaneithorax I have had five nests
and one pair are sitting now (December ioth). Number of eggs
in each clutch usually five. The result of all this nesting is one
fine youngster. So unsatisfactory a result cannot be called
breeding a species, it is mere bungling. My mistake has been
in not treating this as a purely insectivorous species — during its
breeding season. The first nest produced a strong brood of
three ; the second was wrecked by other birds ; the third ditto ;
the fourth, three young ; in the fifth the eggs are still unhatched.
Of the six adults I have lost three— entirely from an overtaxed
digestive system.
To ascertain the period of incubation I took two eggs from
one nest, which had only been sat on a few hours, and placed
them under a steady hen Canary with three equally fresh eggs of
her own. One of the two was infertile; the other hatched in
fifteen days and a few hours. Adding to this the above-
mentioned hours and allowing for the fact that incubation was
carried on in a warm room, I think we may estimate the normal
period of incubation at sixteen days — which, I need hardly say,
is quite exceptionally long for a Manuikin.
The newly hatched chick was a remarkable little object.

I had it under observation for the best part of one day. When
ever the hen Canary came off the nest it raised its head and neck
and, opening its minute beak, rolled a short bulbous tongue to
and fro with a slow, rythmic, pendulum-like motion the rate of
which never varied. This action must either serve as an
incentive to the parent to feed it, or more probably as a guide to
aid the parent in feeding it in the semi-obscurity of a domed
nest with a tunnel entrance. Needless to say its foster mother
could not feed it (and how its own parents could introduce any
food into that tiny gape is hard to understand !), so I put it in
spirits and found a place for it in my cabinet.
At eighteen days a young Chestnut-breasted Finch is a
little brown bird exactly resembling a young fiaviprymna and
totally unlike its parents. It has not a black, or a white, or a
chestnut-coloured feather on it. After that age, however, there
is not the smallest resemblance between the young of these
two species.
The young castaneithorax which I now have was hatched
about August 24th, and left the nest on September 10th. From
September 13th to October 3rd I have no notes (owing to absence
from home). By October 4th it had developed a pale chestnut
breast and the lower chest and abdomen had become nearly
white. On Oct. 14th it showed one black feather on the throat.
On the 22nd another appeared, and the first feather of the series
forming the black bar across the chest. On the 26th its beak
began to change colour, the bluish shade appearing at the base
first. (This appears to be normal as I have observed the same
thing in the young of the Long-tailed Grassfinch). The change
of colour of the beak was completed by Nov. 8, thus occupying
thirteen days. On the 13th two more black feathers appeared on
the side of the chest, forming a continuation of the black bar;
on the 14th another ditto. On Dec. 9 I examined this bird care-
fully. Its back and tail were then mouse-colour ; breast, pale
chestnut; abdomen, pure white; two dark feathers on back of
head, two black ditto on throat, and many around the base of the
beak. The black bar was most clearly defined and the feathers
composing it were almost all new sheath feathers, many of them
having only just come down ; yet the bird showed no sign^ofji^

moult elsewhere. I extracted some and found them identical
with corresponding breast feathers of an adult hen. There is no
change of colour here.
Evidently the assumption of the adult plumage is a very
slow process as compared with M. flaviprymna, and, iu fine, I
think we may say that, as with the adults, so in the case of the
young, these two species show equally remarkable similarities
and dissimilarities.

DESCRIPTION OF NESTLING GOULDIAN FINCHES.

<bodyText confidence="0.993121814814815" page_id="33229096"  page_num="124" year="" vol="">
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Owing to the fact that I left my Gouldian and several
other Australian finches out-of-doors until December 21st, I
lost one of my Ringed-finches and a young Gouldian-finch :
the cold they did not mind in the least, but the frequent rains
and morning fogs were too much for them.*
As no accurate description has hitherto been published
to my knowledge, of the first plumage of Poephila mirabilis and
I have the dead body before me now, I think it well to note
its colouring.
The blue metallic warts at the base of the bill are retained
for a month or two after the young bird leaves the nest, but have
disappeared from the specimen before me which flew either on
the 12th or 14th September; in this specimen also the upper
tail-coverts are just beginning to assume their adult peacock-
green colouring, of which there is no trace when the bird leaves
the nest: otherwise the infant-plumage is retained. Upper
surface ash-grey washed with olive-green, the forehead darker
grey, inner webs of flights and inner portion of outer webs of
primaries dark smoke-grey ; central tail feathers blackish
towards the tips, outer feathers grey, the remainder with grey
inner webs : sides of face whitey-brown with a faint olivaceous
tinge, cheeks slightly browner, chin whitish with barely
perceptible tinge of olive at the sides; breast pale dove-brown ;
abdomen white, slightly washed with golden buff at the sides ;
* The Ringed-finch, however, was probably killed by a Yellow-rump as all one
side of its face was bare of feathers.

under tail-coverts white; under wing-coverts white faintly
tinged with 3^ellow at the base ; flights below leaden-greyish ;
beak darker than in adult bird; feet flesh-coloured, the digits
dusky below ; eyes too much sunken for description.
At an earlier age the green wash on the upper parts and
wings is less strongly defined ; the adult colouring is undoubtedly
acquired partly, if not entirely, by a gradual moult, the new
feathers being developed over the old which then become loose
and gradually fall out (I watched this process in caged 3&apos;oung
birds in 1896).
Although my recent experience with this species would
seem to indicate that our climate is unsuited in the winter to
the requirements of Gouldian (as well as possibly Ringed) finches,
it must be remembered that the cock and two hen adult birds
and the other young one are none the worse for the ordeal ; and
though I shall not again leave them outside so late in the year
because of the suburban position of my garden, I should have
no hesitation in doing so in any part of the country less liable to
be visited by Loudon fogs or cold penetrating mists : clear dry
frosts only seem to enliven these birds.
There is not the least doubt that I could have left my
Tambourine Doves and Chinese Quails outside without risk all
the winter, but it is more pleasant to look after them indoors in
inclement weather.
On examining the various nesting receptacles I found
about two dozen eggs of Poephila goiddicz, some long since dried
up, others evidently laid quite recently : indoors the mothers
would certainly have died from egg-binding ; I succeeded in
blowing eight eggs for the cabinet.
Before leaving the Gouldian-finch, perhaps it would be
well to say something about its various notes : — The ordinary call
is a double note, or sort of t see- wee ; its note of defiance is a
sort of ting or Hang, also I think a note of alarm ; then the bird
has an aggravating trick when alighting on its nest of uttering a
rapid chich-ich-ich-ich-ich followed by its ordinary call-note which
is very misleading to the breeder, who imagines that he has
young in the nest when there are o\\\y eggs : it was this last trick
which tempted me to keep my birds out so late in the year 1906,

as I feared lest I might just lose a second nest of young if I
hurried them indoors at the end of September. It is certain that
many birds which call as they approach a nest of youngsters, do
so also when only eggs are present (I have noted this in the case
of the House-Martin); but probably very few utter sounds re-
sembling the cries of a family of young birds.

<bodyText confidence="0.994897714285714" page_id="33229098"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
I received from Miss Alderson four Conures which she had
privately imported from Jamaica. I turned them into an un-
heated garden aviary in May, two in one division and two —
which Miss Alderson thought to be a true pair — into another with
a large flight. For the first month they were terribly noisy and
&amp;quot;crawked&amp;quot; constantly, so much so that I even meditated getting
rid of them. They have gradually quieted down and now have
ceased to be a nuisance, though the two in the smaller division
&amp;quot; crawk &amp;quot; at me unmercifully when I am standing inside.
The &amp;quot; pair&amp;quot; justified Miss Alderson&apos;s faith in them, and on
21st June I noticed one of them had disappeared into the nesting
box. They must have played about for some time, for it was not
till August ioth I discovered four white eggs in the nest. On
August 1 8th I heard the sweet music of a chick&apos;s lusty voice ;
but alas ! it was silenced next day, and I found it quite dead,
evidently never having been fed. Two more were hatched. No.
2 was lusty and strong on the third day, but on that same day the
hen was very sick and bad and quite forsook her nest. After
consultation with my father, who takes the greatest interest in
my birds, we decided that it was one chance against nothing to
remove the two baby Conures and put them into a Green
Budgerigar&apos;s husk where some infant Budgerigars were daily
hatching. I found the two slate-coloured chicks ice cold.
However] I warmed them in my hands and then transferred
them to the husk. Mrs. Budgery popped back and then we
watched for half- an - hour. We could see no sign of her
resisting the intrusion. Next day No. 2 Conure was still
flourishing, but No. 3 was dead, and the next day I found it

turned out of the husk. The Budgerigars continued steadily
caring for their own chick and their nursling, though I think
it was subject to some discussion in Budgerigar circles ; as
many as five would congregate on the husk and quite evidently
examine the stranger through the hole and then chatter over
the matter. I gave stale white bread soaked in cold water,
squeezed dry and crumbled, also canary and a very little millet
and green stuff. On the 22nd Aug. the fifth and last Budgerigar
baby left the nest, a very fine and healthy quintette. Next
morning the young Conure was dead. It was a remarkably cold
night, quite bitter. The young bird was well fledged and a fine
youngster, though of course not as forwardas its foster-brothers.
The hen Conure quite recovered, and I hope for better
success next year. Possibly had I a party of young Cockatiels
just hatching they would have been the better birds to try, but
Budgerigars are so bold and confiding that they are not easily
disturbed, and Mrs. Cockatiel sits so close, resenting intrusion
somewhat vigorously, that it would be more difficult to introduce
strangers to her nest. Transferring the eggs as hatched would
probably be best. M. Wiujams.

By Mrs. Henry Bromet.
I am sending you an account of my aviary and the young
birds reared in it this year (1906).
The aviary is built against a brick wall and faces west. I
know the aspect has been condemned, but my birds do not seem
to find it too hot. It is shaded by trees and I have Venetian
blinds. The inner portion is 18 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 7 feet
high at the eaves. It is a wooden structure with a span roof and
entire glass front (wired outside), folding doors at the south end,
half glass, half wood, so that I can open half or fold back both
against the wall, and from May to November these doors are
open.
The aviary has a concrete floor aud fountain with basin
3 inches deep, the overflow from this runs down a small gutter-

and makes a stream through the flight, which is 27 feet long, 8
feet wide, and 7 feet high, and is covered with wire netting,
half-inch mesh. This is planted with small spruce and box
trees, ferns, reeds, primroses, &amp;c, and the brick wall is covered
with ivy.
The inner portion of the aviary is heated with hot water
pipes, on the greenhouse system, and is painted white inside and
well fitted up with nest boxes of every description. This year I
have had seven Silverbills from one pair; two nests, in the same
cocoanut husk in the flight ; three hybrids, from a Fawn and
White Bengali hen and a cock Spice Bird ; the young birds are
beautifully laced ; the parents were assisted in the incubation and
feeding by a cock Bronze Mannikin.
From my three pairs of Zebra Finches I have only three
young birds, out of one nest. Two pairs of Gouldians (black-
faced cocks and red-faced hens) both started to nest the last week
in August, both pairs choosing rush nests, hanging from the
roof of the aviary on the same level, and the openings exactly
facing each other, they sat splendidly, the cocks taking their
turns, and they were all friendly, no doubt because they had
lived together through the winter ; they would allow me to peep in
the nests and never attempt to fly off. I was very excited one
morning, when I was sitting in the aviary, after watching the two
hens feed and return to the nests, I heard faint husky chirps,
which daily got louder and louder until I heard them outside the
aviary. The climax was when three strong young birds flew out
of one nest and four out of the other : I have lost one of them, it
was the weakling ; but I am sorry to say I have lost both the hens
in the second nests : I did not wish them to nest again, but dare
not risk separating them from the cock birds, lest they should
not feed the young ones. I should do so another time, as my
two cock birds brought these young ones up alone, and they
seem very healthy lively birds and are quite unrelated, for I got
all four parent birds from different places. I am now thinking
of the pleasure I shall have in watching the young birds getting
their adult plumage.
My Bicheno Finches built a nest of white paper shavings

branches in the flight : they brought up two young ones who were
just ready for flight, when we had a week of very heavy rain,
and although I fixed a large board outside on the wire, com-
pletely covering the nest, the cold and damp must have killed
them. I hope I shall be more fortunate in 1907. The old birds
seem in first rate condition. I noticed the cock Bicheno spent all
his time, on the path in the flight, catching gnats and small
flies, and I think the young ones were fed principally on
these.
My Cordon Bleus have five eggs : the hen sat about four
days, and now a hen Bengali has taken her place : I doubt if they
will hatch.
I have four young ones from one pair of Bengalese. In
another aviary (but only a small one, 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and
8 feet high, and unheated) I have four pairs of Budgerigars and
two pairs of Chinese Painted Quails — in the other half of it I
have a hen Crimson-wing Parrakeet.
I have a lovely green Malabar Fruitsucker in a cage, he is
very tame and sings beautifully ; also a black Himalayan Robin,
but he is free with his wing cut. I have had these two nearly
three years.

A paper, of much interest to those concerned with the accli-
matization of foreign birds for purposes of utility, appears in the
Bulleti?i de la, Societe National oV Acclimatation de France for
December 1906, on the rearing of the American Rhea in France.
It appears that members of the Acclimatization Society have
conducted experiments in the breeding of these birds since 1855,
and at the present time the Rhea appears to be quite established
as a domesticated species in France, where it breeds regularly.
It is perfectly hardy, passing the winters in the open.
At three years of age these birds are adult. As is well
known, the male performs the duty of incubation, which occupies
a period of from 34 to 40 days.
The species is stated to be polygamous, a statement which

we believe to be incorrect. The Rhea is almost certainly polyan-
drous, a female pairing successively where opportunity occurs as
in a wild state, with two or more males. Polygamy cannot
succeed with a species in which the male incubates, for he
could not cover the number of eggs that would be laid by several
females, and where the breeders, from the belief that these birds
are polygamous, keep several females with one male the waste of
eggs which cannot possibly be incubated is enormous. Rheas do
extremely well in captivity and may be kept in a comparatively
small space, but naturally do best if they can have the run of a
large field or a park where they are very decorative. In France
they are fed on potatoes, cut up beetroot, bran and green food.
They cost very little to keep and may produce considerable profit
to their owners. The flesh of birds of about a year old is said to
be excellent and in taste to resemble something between turkej 7
and mutton. The eggs are very good to eat, their contents being
equal to that of from twelve to fifteen fowl&apos;s eggs, while their
feathers sell readily at a good price.
Rheas require very little water as they rarely drink and
never bathe, but a dust bath is a necessity. They live har-
moniously with fowls, ducks and geese, but are liable to devour
young chickens.
The male Rhea takes great care of the young, which are
reared without difficulty. The female should never be left with
the young, as she will eat their food, and possibly kill them.
Artificial incubation has been tried with very little success
in France.

so I removed them to a large aviary with grass and shrubs where
they were very active, and laid two clutches of eggs in corners
of the shelter on a few twigs and straws drawn together, hardly
worth calling a nest; the hen made no attempt to incubate
though she hovered round the eggs a good deal. I am sorry I
did not take exact notes of dates, but it must have been at the
end of May that a small coop with a turf nest in it was put in
this aviary, and the dove took to it at once. Two eggs were laid
oil the turf nest and the hen began to sit at once. Both birds
sat alternately and together never leaving the eggs uncovered,
and we believe they hatched out on June the 14th, just fourteen
days from the commencement of sitting. The old birds were
most secretive, and allowed us no glimpse of the young birds for
more than a week. I then discovered there were two. The little
ones came out in about three weeks, tiny downy things, rather
like young ducks, and hardly visible on the ground. They grew
fast and were soon exactly like the old birds, who went on feed-
ing them for a long time. There was a scare in the aviary one
night, a cat on the top, and the smaller of the young doves — as
I conclude the hen — was found dead on the ground with no
apparent injury. The remaining one is alive now, and the three
are always together and roost close together in a slight depression
on the ground. The young one seems to feel the cold more than
the old ones, and is asthmatic after a cold night but recovers
when the sun comes out. It was very touching to see the old
cock feeding the young one carefully when he was rather puffed
up, the young one being the bigger bird. They are absolutely
tame and most fascinating pets, running to meet us directly we
appear, and in the summer always bowing and cooing to us.
It appears that with good luck they might have several
pairs of young in the season, and I hope for more this year.

AQUATIC BIRDS. *
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991829032258065" page_id="33229104"  page_num="132" year="" vol="">
This handsome volume of nearly 600 pages deals with a
most interesting class of birds comprising those which, from
their shy nature, are perhaps the least familiar to the majority of
British ornithologists. It is the outcome of more than twenty
years observation, chiefly carried out on the Irish coast ; but
besides recording his own observations the author has been care-
ful to refer to the works of all the most trustworthy authorities
on the groups dealt with, so that the book is a valuable record of
practically all that is known of the aquatic birds of the United
Kingdom. The title is somewhat misleading as a few of the
species treated of, e.g. the Bustards or Laud Rail, can hardly be
called aquatic, while the Dipper is not mentioned ; but then the
Bustards belong to an Order in which the majority of the species
are more or less aquatic so the author has thought it best to
include them, and this applies also to the Land Rail, while the
great majority of the Passeres being land-birds, the few that are
aquatic are omitted.
The author very rightly condemns the wanton destruction
of birds and the craze for collecting their eggs, but he considers
that the systematic ornithologist who would study the plumages
and structural characters of birds must collect a certain number
of specimens, and with this we entirely agree; but perhaps some
of the best work can be done with a powerful binocular if the
observer knows how to properly conceal himself, and Professor
Patten gives some good hints as to how this may be done.
The very careful descriptions of plumage in its various
seasonal phases form a valuable feature of this book.
The illustrations, one of which we reproduce here by the
courtesy of the Publisher, are numerous and good, and a reliable
systematic, as well as a general index adds to the usefulness of
the book.

<bodyText confidence="0.988198769230769" page_id="33229107"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
This useful key has been compiled principally from the
British Museum Catalogue of birds. Some of the descriptions
are exactly reproduced, others are added to, while a portion is
described from the author&apos;s private collection. A map of Aus-
tralia showing the various sub-regions as defined by Professor
Spencer, forms a frontispiece. A list of Australian species and
sub-species recently described as new, and of species recently
added to the Australian list, is printed at the end of this second
edition, while indices to Genera and Vernacular names are
supplied.
The volume forms a complete list of all the Australian
birds with brief descriptions and their habitat. Those who study
Australian birds cannot afford to be without this useful book.

THE SOCIETY&apos;S MEDAL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984873058823529" page_id="33229107"  page_num="133" year="" vol="">
In the January number an article appeared by Mrs.
Johnstone, on the successful rearing of a young Fraser&apos;s
Touracou {Teuracus macrorhynchus), and the Council regard this
as a very important avicultural event and propose to award the
medal struck in silver, providing that no record of a previous
occurrence is forthcoming.
In the present issue Mr. Teschemaker records the
successful breeding of both the Yellow-rumped Finch (Mwiia
flaviprymna) and the Chestnut-breasted Finch {M. cas I a?iei thorax).
According to Gedney the latter species was bred by him, and in
the Report of the United Kingdom Foreig?i Cage Bird Society for
December 1891 it is recorded that Mr. Osbaldeston reared three
young of M. castatieithorax. The Yellow-rumped Finch however
does not appear to have been previously bred successfully in the
United Kingdom, and it is proposed to award a medal. Any
member or reader knowing of a previous instance is requested to
communicate immediately with the Hon. Business Secretary.

THE LIGHT MULE PROBLEM.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998486323529412" page_id="33229108"  page_num="134" year="" vol="">
Sir, — There is one aspect of this puzzle which I do not think
has received adequate attention — that is, that in crosses with the Canary
the colour of the latter bird is recessive, as students of the Mendelian
theory of heredity say, of course we do get clear and pied mules, but, they
are alas ! exceptions. Normally, Canary mules, even when dark, follow the
colour of their wild parent. Pair a Canary with a Linnet, you get a brown
mule; with a Greenfinch or a Siskin, a green one; with a Goldfinch, the
prevailing colour of the result is again brown, not green.
Lest it should be imagined that this is due to the fact of the Canary
being a domesticated bird, I would quote some other instances. If you
pair a Pigeon and a Barbary Dove — both domesticated — the colour will be a
Pigeon&apos;s. If you pair a Guinea-fowl and a common fowl, both domesticated
again, the result will be a fowl&apos;s plumage, not the Guinea-fowl&apos;s, in spite of
the distinct character of the latter.
Even by crossing a wild bird with a tame one 3&apos;ou may constantly get
the latter&apos;s colour prevailing; thus, the hybrids between Fowl and
Pheasant, as anyone may see in those exhibited in the Natural History
Museum, resemble in colour the domesticated parent much more than the
wild one, and vary similarly.
In trying to breed lighter mules, therefore, we are facing a difficulty
inherent in the very nature of the Canary — it is a bird with little power of
stamping its colouration in a cross.
It may be said that this does not help us much, but it is something to
clearly see where the difficulty lies. What we want is a prepotent Canary,
one which is exceptional in having the power of stamping its colour; and a
Canary that produced even dark mules, if those mules were green, would be
worth looking after, just like one which produced light mules.
But failing a prepotent Canary, there may be such a thing as a
recessive Goldfinch — an individual which has small power of colour-trans-
mission. The virtues of such a bird could of course, only be realized by
breeding light or green mules from him, but if obtained, he should be
preserved, and an attempt made to breed more from him, as Goldfinches
have repeatedly bred, not only in aviaries, but in Canary breeding cages.

Sir, — Will some of our readers kindly say the different ways of
feeding Shamahs. I feed mine on Century Food grade 3, mixed with a hard
boiled egg, a potato, and the best ants&apos; cocoons soaked and squeezed dry,
and added ; he gets a pot full of this and most of the ants&apos; eggs, and then

the rest goes to the birds in the aviary. Though I clean his cage ever}&apos; dav-
it sometimes smells sour. I tried Abrahams&apos; food and ants&apos; eggs and dried
yolk of egg : that suited him too. He is in perfect plumage and sings well.
Are these foods too heating? He always picks out the ants&apos; eggs first. I
give him two or three mealworms a day. Can I give him more? He lives
in a box cage in a living room, the cage is about 22in. long and 14m. wide.
He will not go into his bath, only splashes on the edge. He throws up
pellets sometimes. I should also like to know how to get rid of mice in an
aviary. They will not go into traps and I will not use poison.
M. C. HAWKE.
The following reply has been sent to the Hon. Mary C. Haiuke :
My bird was sent as a present from Mr. Heselton in 1903 and is a fine
singer and never out of health. I keep it in a box-cage, 2ft. 6in. frontage,
l8in. from front to back, 2oin. in height, with zinc draw-tray and large
water-pan in which it can bathe at will ; this it does frequently. I keep
the cage at the end of my conservatory (31ft. by 15ft.) facing S.W.
I feed my bird upon two parts crumb of stale household bread, one
part powdered sweet biscuit, one part yolk of egg or hard-boiled egg (both
yolk and white) and one part Grade 1 Century Food. I rarely give meal-
worms, but often cockroaches and, in the summer, caterpillars, moths or
spiders.
During the three years in which it has been in my possession this
Shamah has never had a single dav&apos;s illness. A. G. BuTXER.

COLOUR-CHANGE IN FEATHERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997544" page_id="33229109"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
Sir, — My own convictions with regard to the fact that feathers do
retain vitality after they have ceased growing were published in our
Magazine, 1st series, vol. VIII., pp. 132-5, in a short article entitled
&amp;quot; Feathers changing colour.&amp;quot;
Since the publication of the paper above referred to I have seen no
reason to change my opinion. I listened with great interest to Prof. Dwight&apos;s
lecture at the Ornithological Congress; but it revealed no new doctrine,
but only proved what we knew before, that changes in the colouring of
plumage are often effected by the loss of the fringes of the feathers ; or
at times by parts of the web, thus rendering a coloured shaft more
conspicuous. I could add to this, that I have known a Brambling, in
the shelter of an indoor aviary, to retain its winter fringes almost up to
the time of the autumn moult; there being neither rough brushwood
nor stormy weather to assist them to break away.
During the summer of 1906 I purchased half a dozen Weavers out of
colour, supposed by the dealer who sold them to be Orange and Napoleon
Weavers; three of these died the next day, unhappily one which 5-liacL-—
selected as (a probable male of ) P. flammiceps among them; the other two-

were palpably P. franciscana and the three that lived P. afra, two cocks
and one hen : one of the cock birds I placed in the bird room which is
always fairly warm and the other in a small aviary at the back with a glass
roof, the former came into full colour, but the latter after developing half
way to the breeding plumage just as gradually returned to the winter
plumage (during the whole process forward and backward 110 feathers were
visible on the floor of the little aviary) ; this is the second time that I have
had the same experience of the action of cold upon the colouring of
feathers; but it must be borne in mind that this action only affects feathers
upon living birds.
But the case of the Touracous in which the pigment washed out of a
feather upon the living bird is replaced after a comparatively short time,
so that the feather becomes as brilliant as it was before the bath, will require
a lot of explaining away by those who assert that a perfected feather is life-
less; so also will the teachers of the docttine of perfection in death find it
difficult to explain why the plumage of a dead bird, though not exposed to
the light, should change in tint to such an extent that the pansy blue or
ultramarine on the breast of the living bird is described in a scientific
catalogue as lilac, (and correctly too, as one sees when one examines the
skins from which the description was taken).
I believe, when we get more powerful microscopes with which to
study the internal structures of feathers, it will be found that nutrition is
somehow conveyed even to the most delicate filaments. Seeing is believ-
ing, and at present evidence is not forthcoming, and what can be seen
seems opposed to this belief; but no organism or part of an organism is too
delicate to be supplied with blood-vessels, or numerous insects which barely
surpass in size the motes in a sunbeam could not exist.

THE RED-EYED VIREO.
The folloiving note has been sent to Madame Gorter in reply to a quety :
The Red-eyed Vireo, Greenling or Flycatcher (Vireo olivasceus) is a
bird very seldom imported and not included in the List of Animals which
have lived in the Zoological Gardens. It should be fed like a Song-Thrush,
but with plenty of insect food.
The Vireonidce have been regarded as relations of the Shrikes or
Butcher-birds, but they construct suspended nests after the fashion of the

Elephants which, with three received in 1905, form perhaps the finest
collection of these magnificent animals that have ever been seen in any
Zoological Gardens. The birds in the collection consist of two Red-backed
Sparrows {Passer rufidorsalis) ; one Cretzschmar&apos;s Bunting (Emberiza
ccesia) ; one Grey Heron {Ardea cinerea) ; and one Rosy-grey Dove [Turtur
roseogriseus).
THE RUFOUS-BACKED MANNIKIN.
A small consignment of this rare and pretty Mannikin {Spermesles
nigriceps) has recently been on view in the shop of Mr. Liter, the bird
dealer in Leman Street, E-, and they appeared to be in excellent condition.
They remind one much of the Bronze Mannikin, but the back is a rich
chestnut. The species inhabits &amp;quot; East Africa, from the Zanzibar region
down to Natal &amp;quot; (B. M. Catalogue).
THE DOVE ACCLIMATIZATION EXPERIMENT.
Members of this Soceity who are interested in the proposed experi-
ment of liberating a number of Crested and other Doves in Regent&apos;s Park,
will be glad to hear that over thirty birds are now housed in one of the
central compartments of the Western Aviary at the Zoological Gardens.
These consist of seventeen Australian Crested Doves, ten Bronze-wings,
four Necklaced Doves, three Half-collared Doves and two Senegal Doves.
A small Committee has been formed to manage this experiment, con-
sisting of Mr. Castle-Sloane, Mr. Newman, Dr. Drewitt and myself, and we
should be very glad of donations of Doves, or money to buy them. The
best species for the purpose is the Australian Crested Dove, and we should
be especially grateful for any of these birds, but other hardy species would
be very acceptable, even the common- Barbary or Ringed Turtle Dove which
doubtless many members possess. It is proposed to mark the birds with
aluminium rings, and I should be glad of suggestions as to the most
suitable kind for the purpose. D. SeTh-Smith.
PROPAGATING MEALWORMS.
Will members who have been successful iu propagating mealworms
be kind enough to explain their method for the benefit of other members?
The text-books tell us how to do it, but if we follow their advice we
generally succeed in propagating myriads of mites and clothes moths, but
no mealworms. On the Continent however mealworms are bred extensively
for sale. They are very expensive to buy, and it would be a great saving to
those aviculturists who keep many insectivorous birds, if they understood
how to propagate their own. D. S^S.

THE BLUE KNORHAAN.
Otis ccBruleus.
By Capt. Boyd R. Horsbrtjgh, A.S.C., F.Z.S., etc.
In April, 1905, I was lucky enough to obtain in the market
at Bloemfontein, a pair of the Blue Knorhaan. Neither before
nor since have I seen these birds for sale alive, nor have I seen
any in captivity, so I conclude that it was an exceptionally lucky
chance that brought this latter pair into my keeping. They
were then perhaps six weeks old, in very rough plumage, and
about the size of Red-legged Partridges, only of course longer
in the leg.
From the moment that I took them out of the little crate
in which they had been brought to market, they proved them-
selves to be most extraordinarily tame, following my wife and
me around the garden from the very first, with a loud querulous
cry like that of a young kitten.
From the first they fed better from the hand than in any
other way. Their appetite was delicate and I am convinced that
if they had not constantly been coaxed into accepting their food,
they would not have lived many months.
The blue colour on both of these birds was very pale at
this time, and their legs were of a greyish colour ; the female
was slightly smaller than the male, and her face and eyebrows
were distinctly browner than those of her mate. It was quite
evident that they had been reared by a woman on a farm, and
they had rather a fascinating trick of sitting down on the edge
of a skirt whenever they got the chance. The hen was particu-
larly fond of doing this, and always crooned a little song to herself&amp;quot;

beaks on one&apos;s boots; and visitors always had to be warned not to
tread on them as they were everlastingly under one&apos;s feet
investigating boot laces.
We built a large run for them, with a nice hen-house in the
middle of it. This latter they inhabited at night and it was no
easy matter for the Kaffir to drive them in every evening. They
defied him and mocked him in every way — spreading their
wings and skipping about on their agile little legs until the
distracted Kaffir — who was not allowed to touch them — had very
often to call for assistance.
When they were let out of their run into the garden, —
which only occurred when there was some one by to be on the
look out for strange dogs, — a favourite trick of theirs was to
make a dash for the nearest fiat stone bordering the flower beds
and to wait beside it, stamping impatiently until it was turned
over, when there was a rush for any grubs, beetles or stone cock-
roaches that lay beneath it ; then off to the next stone, — over
with that, — and down with a delectable little scorpion !
When the garden was still in the process of making, these
two were a serious impediment to the gardener. They thought
he was employed to turn over stones for their special benefit,
and the unfortunate man could scarcely get his pick under a
stone before their eager little beaks were under it too.
Mr. Sclater states in his book that this is rather a scarce
bird, but although I have never seen many at a time I fancy it is
pretty widely distributed over the Orange River Colony. On the
majority of mornings when out 011 shooting trips the first sound
to reach my ears was the clear ringing cry of &amp;quot; K?wck-me-dozmi,
Knock-me-down, — me dow?i — me-down /&amp;quot; that the cock birds give
vent to at dawn.
I have seen dead birds for sale at the game market in
Bloernfontem in some numbers. They had generally been
killed with a bullet, and this hardly bears out Mr. Millais&apos;
experience that the bird is tame and unsuspicious. Not that I
would doubt Mr. Millais&apos; experience of them, but at the present
date I have found them — in the Orange River Colony at any
rate — extremely wild and very well able to take care of them-
selves.

You may see them and try to stalk them, but at 200 yards
the slim graceful blue neck stiffens, the banded chestnut and
white wings open and with a mocking shout of Knock-me-down !
he is off — for ten miles or more.
In May the cock of my pair started his call note, to which
he always treats us when he is first let .out of his house in the
early morning. He is an excellent indicator of early or late
rising on the part of the Kaffirs whose first duty it is to let the
Knorhaan out into their run.
In December 1905 both my birds had got their plumage in
the most beautiful order and were masters of the companions we
had added to their run, i.e. some Stanley Cranes and Spur-winged
and Egyptian Geese, while a Buff - backed Heron that was
flying at hack around the garden was always a great source of
distraction to them, their object being to keep him on the wing.
Like most bullies they were cowards at heart, and a hen with
chicks sent them shouting off in very quick time.
It was always an amusement to us to drive them across the
garden to the pigeon-house and then to drive the pigeons out of
it and straight at them. This invariably caused consternation
mingled with horror. The little pair would stand rooted to the
ground with wide open beaks and out-spread wings — the hen
would utter a loud squawk, the cock would hoarsely shout his
&amp;quot;Knock-me-down,&amp;quot; — and then they would turn tail and run,
with that mincing, pattering, and amazingly swift gait of theirs.
In January 1906, when the birds were just under a year
old, I observed that their legs were changing to a yellowish
colour, and I have no doubt that these birds take at least two
3 r ears to become fully adult.
In February I regret to say that the hen bird — the nearest
in the picture — was murdered in my garden by a neighbour&apos;s
dog. We rescued her just alive, poor thing, and sewed up the
dreadful wound in her breast, but a few hours later she crept on
to the edge of my wife&apos;s dress and contentedly sat down and
died.
The cock I still have. When I went home last summer on
four months leave I left him in the Pretoria Zoo, where he had
for company a Barron&apos;s Knorhaan {Otis barronii) — but he is back

again with me now and as vociferous as ever in the early
morning.
I fed my birds on lean, cooked and chopped meat, lettuce,
bread and milk, Quaker oats soaked in water, on locusts when
they were about, on chopped lizards (the tails were found most
acceptable) ; and once, when I was drowning some mice in the
Knorhaau run, the cock bird swallowed three little ones in
quick succession and seemed to appreciate them very much.
In a wild state I am certain that these birds, in common
with others of the same family, eat practically no grain at all,
but live on locusts, grasshoppers, etc., and on any odd insects
they come across.
I am told the Blue Kuorhaan are good eating, but having
the tame birds I could never bring myself to the idea of sampling
the wild ones.

Sericulus ??ielt7ius.
By Reginald Phillipps.
In January, 1906, I gave an account of the hatching, in
my aviary, of two young of this species. The elder of the two
was hatched on August 6, 1905 ; and it is about this bird that I
now propose to say a few words.
During 1906, his health was perfect : and in the autumn
he went through a rapid and complete moult. Much of the past
winter he spent in the company of the odd female — referred to
in my former paper — whom he courted after the most approved
fashion of the Regent; for our winter, as I explained before, is
the natural breeding season of the species. A few days before
his death, his demonstrations of affection were very pronounced,
almost violent, and led up to and ended in a fit. When I
entered the birdroom on February 15, I found him in one of the
houses in a hopeless state, anxiously waited upon by his devoted
mother, who hovered near him during the whole day, not once
going into the garden ; he died during the ensuing night.
Last autumn, after the moult, the plumage became some-
what darker than it had hitherto been, the general colour being

much the same as that of the adult female ; but it retained the
two distinctive points, (1) a &amp;lt;J horn &amp;quot; projecting forward from
the front corners of the crown patch over each eye, although
not so markedly as before the moult, and (2) the upper part of
the body being more speckled, and the light-buff marks on the
tips of some four of the inner secondaries of each wing being very
plainly to be seen. I think these latter were more conspicuous
than they were before the moult.
On examination after death, some of the &amp;quot;specks&amp;quot; on the
mantle were found to have yellow centres ; though possibly
there may not have been more yellow, or &amp;quot; yellowish,&amp;quot; on the
upper parts than is usual at certain seasons on the adult female.
But the underside of the wings, especially towards the axillaries,
was suffused with yellow in a manner I have never noticed in a
female. There were no black marks on the flights, so I cannot
positively say that the bird was an immature male ; but its
behaviour, and altogether, make me reasonably satisfied that it
was one.
On p. 127 of vol. IV, there may be seen a sketch of the
upper parts of the head of the younger of the two nestlings,
presumably a female. The horns of the elder bird, at that time,
were not straight but curved like a Turkish crescent, as stated
on p. 126. It would seem, therefore, as if the curved horns, as
distinguished from the straight ones, may be taken as the
distinctive mark of the nestling male; but it must not be over-
looked that these curved horns afterwards became straight
(bottom of page 127). L,ater, the spots on the tips of the inner
secondaries may possibly be an indication of sex (p. 131). Then
there was (it had not been re-assumed) the black bar projecting
down behind each eye, referred to on p. 129. All these points
should be watched by those who may have opportunity.
This bird still retained the dark bill and eye ; and that
neither yellow patch nor black tip should have appeared on the
nights would seem to demonstrate that the male Regent cannot
come into full colour until he is at any rate some four years old.
N.B. — The bird proved, on dissection, to be a male. I
ought to have stated that there was no appearance of yellow on
head or nape, as on the females (IV. p. 59), a curious difference^
one would not have expected to find.

After leaving Cape Town our first place of call was Durban,
where only one day was spent, which I passed on the &amp;quot;Bluff&amp;quot; -
collecting insects. Among the many birds observed was the
Tambourine Dove {Tympanistria tympanisiria), the flight of
which is most extraordinarily rapid. The weather in the Mozam-
bique Channel was so bad that we had to run past two of the
islands we had intended to visit — Isla da Europa and Brazza da
India. ■ While in a cyclone, which is by no means a pleasant
experience, many birds took shelter to the leeward of the yacht&apos;s
hull, by great effort preventing themselves from being blown
away, hovering wherever they could find most shelter, but even
then were occasionally whirled away by the storm and occasion-
ally dashed into the water. I saw a Little Stint blown into the
water and engulfed in a gigantic wave, yet it came up again, got
on the wing, and worked its way up, sheltering in the trough of
the sea, until it had again reached the yacht&apos;s shelter. The birds
were mostly waders : Wimbrels, Reeves, Curlew Sandpipers,
Ringed Plover, Little Stint, and a large Harrier. A Nightjar
came on board and several common Chimney Swallows. These
last were just finishing a complete spring moult into breeding
plumage, indeed one was clean moulted except that the first
primaries and long tail streamers were still in the blood.
Our first landing place was Mayotte Island, Comoros. We
spent several delightful days collecting there, but got no live
birds. The heat was great and the weather very wet for the most
part, and so bad that on going to Anjuan, another island we had
hoped to collect upon, we found it impossible to land owing to
the sea and rain. I do not propose to enumerate the birds of
Mayotte Island, but two beautiful Paradise Flycatchers were
very common and one, Terpsephone linsayi, appears to be a new
species. Nesacanthis eminentissima is a very beautiful Weaver-
bird ; and a Fruit Pigeon, Alectrcenas sganzini, a beautiful bird,
and a delightful day was spent going to the patch of virgin forest
which it frequents.

o?i Birds seen during the Cruise of the &amp;quot;Valhalla&amp;quot; R.Y.S. 145
From the Comoro Islands we steamed to Diego Suarez, a
splendid natural harbour at the north end of Madagascar. While
here we spent two days at the Camp d&apos;Ambre, a small sanatorium
camp on the edge of the forest that extends nearly the whole
length of the island. The camp is about 36 miles from Diego
Suarez, and some 3,000 feet above sea level. The weather
was atrocious here, — ceaseless deluges of rain ; nevertheless, we
collected many of the birds and insects we heard and saw. The
Greater and Lesser Vasa Parrots were seen. The Lesser has a
most musical cry, and is a bird of great power of flight. One of
each of these was brought back on the yacht. The Greater Vasa
was almost silent, but the Lesser used frequently to utter the
pure wild note. On our way down from the camp in a trolley,
occasionally drawn by mules, we saw very man)&apos;&apos; Quails, small
and dark, many a fine Guinea Fowl, and had the great good
fortune to see, standing on the tram lines, Madagascar&apos;s only
large carnivorus animal, the rare and peculiar Fossa, Cryptoprocta
ferox. It bounded into the forest as our trolly approached.
From Madagascar we visited the Island of Glorioso, on
which lives one Frenchman looking after his coco-nut planta-
tion. The greater part of the island is quite uncultivated. Here
we found but four laud birds : a Thrush-Bulbul, a Zosterops, a
Sun-bird, and the Black and White Crow, Corvjis scaptdatus, that
seems so widely distributed. Very many shore birds were round
the island, especially numerous being the Crab Plovers, Dromas
ardeola, while the Great Frigate-bird, Fregata aquila, was breed-
ing in numbers in the tallest trees, which were full of their very
small nests. The brilliant scarlet inflated pouches of the males,
as they sit in the trees, give the trees the appearance of being
covered with large scarlet flowers, the deep green of the birds
matching the foliage well. Two forms of a Gannet, Sula piscator,
were also breeding in numbers.
After visiting two smaller islands — Isle d&apos;Lise and Isle
Vert — we went to Assumption, a most fascinating island, quite
uninhabited and shewing no signs of man, beyond the presence
of some goats. It is an island of coral rock, more or less thickly
covered with scrub-bushes and a few trees, some four miles long
by two wide. On landing we were soon aware of the preserlce-

of Rails, by their squeaking and grunting, a sound extremely
like that of our Common Water Rail. They were quite tame
and shewed no fear. We caught two, an adult and a full-grown
young one, both of which are now alive and thriving in the
Western Aviary in the Zoological Gardens. Ralhis abbotii is
peculiar to Assumption island, as indeed were all the land birds
we found upon it, with the exception of the Black and White
Crow. The other land birds are a Dove, a Sunbird and a delight-
ful Lark-heeled Cuckoo, Centropus assumptionis . This last would
nearly let you catch it, but not quite ; we could easily have
caught it had we had a little more time. We found its nest,
domed, of grass, with two white eggs. Many sea birds nested
on the island, amongst them the lovely salmon-pink Tropic-bird,
Phaethon rubricauda.
From Assumption Island we went to Aldabra, and were
astonished at the great size of it, with a large lagoon in its centre.
The two crescent-shaped islands must be 100 miles round. It is
not uninhabited, there being a small negro settlement of thirty-
four persons at one end who see to the Turtle and Shell Turtle
fishery, and also look after a small coco-nut plantation. The
rest of the island, or rather islands, are covered with scrub and
forest, and extremely difficult to get about upon. Practically
every bird upon this island, with the exception of the sea birds,
is peculiar, but by far the most remarkable is Abbott&apos;s Ibis {Ibis
abbotti). This Ibis, of which the Colony is about thirty miles from
the settlement, was the most confiding and delightfully familiar
wild bird that I ever saw. It had no fear or suspicion of man, and
allowed one to pick it up without shewing any resentment and,
when put down, proceeded to investigate your boots. It was
hard to photograph because it would examine the camera ; but,
in addition to this, we had mostly pouring rain to contend with.
We saw some thirty individuals, but there are probably more,
and I suspect there are other colonies on the island which are
not known.
A peculiar Weaver-bird, Nesacanthis aldabranus, was very
nice, and abundant in the little settlement. And this island is
the original home of the gigantic Land Tortoise. Testudo elephan-
tina. Many of the laud birds are races of those which frequent

Assumption, and the Rail, Rallus aldabra?ius, has a very strong
resemblance to the Assumption bird. These Rails appear not
to fly, but they can do so, as those at the Zoological Gardens fly
with ease to the higher perches. These Rails fed at once on
anything that was offered them, preferring meat, bread, lettuce
and currants. In the settlement I saw, perched on the arm of a
boy, a perfectly tame Great Frigate-bird.
From Aldabra our intention had beeu to visit Cosmoledo
and Astove Islands, but owing to an unexpected current we had
the ill fortune to run the yacht aground on Assumption, and
when we fortunately got off after 24 hours of considerable
anxiety, it was necessary to go to Seychelles, where we stayed
three weeks. Owing to extremely bad weather we were unable
to visit nearly all the islands that we had hoped to, but we
spent some time at Mahe, and a visit to Mr. Hans Thomasset&apos;s
plantation at Cascade was very delightful. Here we found most
of the existing peculiar birds to be abundant. The beautiful
Rose-crowned Fruit Pigeon particularly so. This bird rises and
falls on the wing like our own Wood Pigeon. Its favourite food
is a small fig, but it eats various fruits, and its movements are
regulated by the ripening of the fruits of certain trees. This
Pigeon shows little fear of man, and it is easy to catch the adult
alive with a noose. We brought three home with us, a fine adult
pair and an immature bird. These were tame from the very first
and showed not the slightest objection to being caged. They
throve on cut banana, raisins, fig cut up, and sultanas. We had
a small supply of their natural food to start with. Fruit Pigeons
in confinement usually soon die of extreme fat ; no doubt this is
brought about by giving them free access to farinaceous and
starchy foods.
A large Thrush-Bulbul, Ixocincla crassirostris, abounds in
Mahe. We also saw great numbers in Prastin and some on
Felicite Islands. It appears to be universal throughout the
Archipelago to which it is pecuiliar. It is known by the name of
Merle. I consider this bird to be the most quarrelsome, the
most objectionably noisy, and generally the most objectionable
bird I have ever had to do with. Its raucous squawking songis
unceasing and it has no beauty to recommend it. Still its

insularity gives it an interest of its own ! Three we brought
home alive had to be kept in separate cage&apos;s, and when in one of
the large compartments ill the Western Aviary they would still
fight among themselves. One of these alone remains. She (?) is
in perfect health, yells unceasingly, and has one eye. The Island
of Praslin has a peculiar Vasa Parrot Coracopsis barkleyi. It is
small, very rare, and has a beautiful wild whistle. On this
island, and also on Felicite we saw a beautiful Paradise Fly-
catcher (Terpsiphoiie corvina), blue black, with light blue bill
and eyelids, and blue legs; the tail is of great length, and the
bird, of which we only saw males, appears rare. I saw only
three on Praslin and one on Felicit6 i It is not found on Mahe\
This bird is known on the islands by the name of Veuve. The
very small Kestrel, Tinnunmlus gracilis, appears to be rare; we
saw only some half-dozen examples. It too is tame. We did
not see, but were fortunate enough to hear the extremely rare
Scops Owl, Gymnoscops insularis. But this is not the place to
enumerate the avifauna of an Archipelago.
On leaving the Seychelles we came home by the Suez Canal,
and nothing avicultural occurred with the exception of procuring
four living examples of Hemprich&apos;s Gull at Aden. This Gull,
which has a restricted range, is extremely common there in the
harbour and, strange to say, the birds we procured were the first
to be exhibited alive in the Zoological Gardens. They would eat
from the hand on the first day they were caught, and infinitely
preferred meat to fish. Three of these may still be seen in the
Gardens in fine condition. With these Gulls the voyage, as far
as this paper is concerned, must end. Its delightful experiences
being mostly but a memory.

The collection of foreigners at the recent show was
perhaps about up to the average of recent years. There were
not many birds of exceptional interest and the judging seems to
have met with general disapproval.

Sydney, who also exhibited a specimen of the rarer Blue-banded
Grass - Parrakeet (Neophe?na ve?iusta), which the Judge did not
deign to notice. Mr. H. Cooper received the second with a nice
pair of Red-vented Blue-bonnets (Psephotus hcematorrhous), a
species which has recently been imported more freely than the
better-known Yellow-vented form (P. xanthorrhous). A Varied
Lorikeet, Barnards, Crimson - winged, Iyineolated, and Kings
Parrakeets were also present.
The most conspicuous exhibit in the class for Parrots was
a fine pair of Banksian Cockatoos belonging to Sir C. Lawes
Wittewronge, Bart. This exhibitor, however, was very un-
fortunate. The male was a magnificent bird, the first adult
male specimen of this Cockatoo exhibited for many years, but
the female was not in quite such good trim, and as the two had
to be judged as one exhibit the Judge gave the first prize to a
single female of the same species, a well-known prize-winner,
in better condition than the female of the pair. Had the male
of the above pair been exhibited alone he would doubtless have
been awarded premier honours.
The class for Common Waxbills, Grassfinches etc. calls
for no comment, but that devoted to the rarer species contained
some interesting specimens. A fine male Violet-eared Waxbill,
in perfect trim, belonging to Mr. L- W. Hawkins, was awarded
first prize, while a Masked Firefinch (Lagonosticta larvala), sent
by the same exhibitor, came second. The third prize went to a
Black-headed Gouldian, certainly a very fine specimen but not to
be compared in rarity to Mr. Townsend&apos;s pair of Rufous-backed
Mannikius (see page 137), Mr. Hawkins&apos; Tri-coloured Parrot-
Finches, or Mrs. Warren Vernon&apos;s Red-collared Whydah, these
three exhibits all being beaten also by a pair of Red-faced
Finches {Zonogastris melba) belonging to Mr. Hawkins, which
obtained fourth prize. The Rufous-backed Mannikin has not
been shown at the Palace for many years if, indeed, at all before.
The most interesting exhibit in the class for &amp;quot; Grosbeaks,
true Finches and Buntings&amp;quot; was a Rock Bunting (Fringillaria
iahapisi) sent by Mr. Townsend which received the second prize,
the first being awarded to a pair of Cuba Finches belongin-g-tQ-

The class for Tanagers contained some grand birds, but
the judging appeared to have been carried out by some extra-
ordinary method of which the Judge himself only knew the
secret. By far the best bird in the class was Mr. Townseud&apos;s
Black-backed Tanager, but it had to give place (according to the
Judge&apos;s method of awarding honours) to a Yellow-winged Sugar-
bird belonging to the same owner. This Sugar-bird was a nice
specimen, but in no better, if as good condition, as the Tanager,
and for rarity it is &amp;quot; not in the same street.&amp;quot; I am told that this
Sugar-bird also won the Abrahams&apos; Memorial Trophy, which is
awarded for the best foreign bird in the show — another sample of
peculiar judging. One of the best birds in this class was a
magnificent Magpie Tanager shown by Mr. J. H. Harrison, an
exhibitor who was by no means well treated by the Judge,
though he had some extremely good birds.
Mr. Harrison obtained the first prize in the next class,
which was a mixed one for everything not included elsewhere.
His fine pair of Silver-eared Mesias being easy winners of
the first place. The second prize went to a Touracou, a
nice bird but not in first rate condition, which description also
applies to the third prize winner, a Green-billed Toucan. Mr.
Townsend&apos;s Metallic Starling {Calornis metallica) obtained fourth
prize. There were other birds in this class which deserved
more than they got, namely Mr. Harrison&apos;s White - throated
Ground-Thrush (v.h.c), Mr, Dewhurst&apos;s Coley (v.h.c), Mr.
Frostick&apos;s Japanese Tits (h.c), and Mr. Cook&apos;s Golden-crowned
Troupial.
In the class for foreign hybrids Mr. Hawkins obtained first
prize with a so-called Red-mantled Parrakeet (see Vol. IV. p. 132),
and a pair of hybrid American Sparrows, sent by Mr. Seth-
Sruith, bred between Zonotrichia lezuophrys and Z. pileata (Vol.
III., p. 331) were awarded second prize. Third, a Redrump and
Mealy Rosella hybrid belonging to Mrs. Cooper. The last-
named exhibitor also obtained the fourth prize with a hybrid

admitted in a class intended for hybrids between two foreign
birds, for the domestic Canary cannot be admitted under this
category. A Bicheno Zebra-finch was sent by Mr. Hawkins
(v.h.C), and there was also a Long-tailed and Masked Grass-

STRAY NOTES.
A striking feature of the recent Bird Show at the Crystal Palace was-
the number of obviously foreign birds shown in the British classes and not
disqualified by the judges. In the Bunting class there were no less than
five Meadow Buntings (Emberiza cia), a species with a very frail claim to
the British list. A single example is said to have been captured in Sussex
in October 1902 which was identified by Dr. Bowdle rSharpe; but, consider-
ing that quite a number must have been imported (for no one can pretend
that those at the Palace were all British-caught), it looks suspiciously as
though the specimen above referred to may also have had an &amp;quot;assisted
passage.&amp;quot;
Most of the Bearded Tits that one sees at shows are undoubtedly
foreigners, for almost every year a few are imported. The only specimen at
the recent show to take a prize was however said to be hand-reared, and as-
it came from the Norfolk Broads district it was doubtless, a British example.
For our part we consider that anyone showing an acknowledged British-
caught Bearded Tit, in defiance of the Wild Bird Protection Act, should be
disqualified from receiving a prize.
In our humble opinion any bird which is on the British list should be
allowed to compete in classes provided for British birds, whether the actual
individuals shown were caught in Great Britain or not. Under present
rules, if a bird is known to be a foreign specimen it is disqualified, but, as-
it is in most cases impossible to say whether a specimen is a true British-
caught example or not, many of the rarest birds in the British classes
which take premier honours, are actually caught on the Continent.
If the management of the Crystal Palace Bird Show will persist, in
order to increase the gate-money, in holding the show over the week-end,.
they can hardly be surprised if foreign - bird exhibitors withhold their
entries. Thursday to the following Tuesday is too lengthy a period for
delicate birds to withstand the strain of the show bench, and there can be
little doubt that the number of entries would be considerably increased if
the show were held say from Tuesday to Friday, though posssibly this
would not compensate the management for missing the Saturday &amp;quot; gate.&amp;quot;

The class provided for Albinos and &amp;quot; Rare-feathered specimens&amp;quot; is
generally an interesting one, and this year there was a very extraordinary
Albino Bullfinch. As is not uncommon with male Albinos of this species
the breast was pink, but this colour was not confined to this region but
extended over the top of the head.
The harm that has resulted from the introduction of predatory
animals into countries where such were previously unknown has been
strikingly illustrated in the well-known case of the Mongoose in the West
Indies, but perhaps an even more lamentable state of affairs is taking place
in certain parts of Australia. According to a writer in a recent number of
the Field the common fox, which was introduced chiefly to kill the rabbits, is
gradually exterminating the Lyre-bird, the &amp;quot; Native-companion &amp;quot; Crane
and other ground-frequenting species.
Great progress has been made towards the completion of the buildings
in the magnificent Zoological Park of New York, which covers some two
hundred and fifty acres, and the work is expected to be finished by the end
of 190S. During last year over two million visitors passed the turnstiles, an
average of six thousand a day.
The current issue of Bird Notes, the journal of the Foreign Bird Club,
contains a letter from Mrs. Miller, recording the laying of eggs in a cage by
a Violet-eared Waxbill, and the Editor adds a note to the effect that he
believes this to be the first instance of any aviculturist getting as far as the
laying of eggs by this species. He has overlooked the fact that Mr.
Phillipps recorded a similar event in the Avicultural Magazine for April,
1906 (page 204). In the same issue it is announced that Dr. Creswell will be
succeeded in the Editorship of Bird Notes by Mr. W. T. Page.

Sir, — I have read in j r our January number, Mr. Bonhote&apos;s criticism
of my article on the moult of the Laughing Gull and heartily sympathize
with your desire to have this matter thrashed out.
The experience and assertions of such men as Prof. Gadow and Dr.
Butler are not lightly to be set aside, and it was with this in mind that I
wrote as the first phrase of the paragraph of my article, &amp;quot; The subject of
the alleged color change in full grown feathers in certain specific cases,&amp;quot;
(TheAuk,Vo\.X&apos;KllI., No. 4, p. 454). My object in beginning this work
was to attack each specific case separately and by thorough, conscientious
observation settle them one way or the other.

Personally speaking, I do not believe (my opinion being based on the
microscopic examination of scores of feathers from different birds) that,
when once the pulp has wholly disappeared from the base of the calamis of
any feather, it ever again breaks through the dried septa or &apos;caps,&apos; and
infuses new life or colour into the interior of the rhachis or barbs. Never-
theless in my work I have tried to approach the subject in an impartial
way, ready at an}&apos; time to be convinced by the evidence of my senses.
The high standing of the ornithologists defending each side of the question,
left no other satisfactory way.
But I am thoroughly convinced that no good can come of reiterated
assertions, which in the present state of our knowledge can lead only to
useless and endless altercations.
What is needed in each case, is a continuous series of observations
made on the living bird in the hand, correlated with accurate microscopic
work. Attacked in this manner, the problem becomes a simple one, and no
ornithologist who has access to a Zoological Garden or a private aviary
need depend upon other than his own observations.
Mr. Bonhote acknowledges the spring moult of Larus, so that needs
no further discussion. The only point now at issue (I am confining my
remarks to this certain specific case!) is concerning any change in the
appearance of the old winter feathers, before they are replaced by the new
ones.
Now before Mr. Bonhote has any right to claim actual color change
in these feathers, he must demonstrate two things : first, that there is
actually a renewal of growth, — a re-opening of vital communication with
the cells of stratum Malpighii (as we are dealing with a pigment not a
structural color) ; and second, that the white tips of the winter feathers
receive a new supply of pigment from the rhachis and do not merely
become worn away and disappear, leaving exposed the dark proximal
portion of each feather.
In the collection of the New York Zoological Park we have two healthy
specimens of Larus ridibundus, brought last year from Europe, and I shall
at once begin to watch their spring changes, as the date of this letter
(Jan. 20th) is well ahead of the time which Mr. Bonhote sets (&amp;quot;February
and March &amp;quot;). My mode of procedure will be as follows and I trust that
Mr. Bonhote will perceive in it more of a desire for the truth and less of
&amp;quot;bluster&amp;quot; than he seemed to discern in my article under discussion.
To prove the first proposition, one has simply to pull out and at once
examine with the microscope a few of the winter feathers during the &amp;quot;ten
days or fortnight &amp;quot; when the &amp;quot; whole change &amp;quot; is taking place. Even a tyro
with the microscope can section the calamus or rhachis, and by an
examination of the very base, can tell whether there is any change going
on within the shaft.
In regard to the white tips,— if a number of feathers, say thirty or

forty, are marked with ink or otherwise, and carefully measured in
millimeters, in situ, — both as to extent of white and ashy portions, and
then re-examine them from time to time, the secret must be revealed.
I hold if the question is worth a moment&apos;s thought or work, it
deserves study, — exhaustive and minute enough to settle it one way or the
other, once and for all.
I should be indeed glad if Mr. Bonhote also would follow out the
above methods of proof, or others as accurate, this spring and let his
results be the &amp;quot; thrashing out&amp;quot; which the Editor so heartily and commend-
ably invites.
The possibilties of wear in the winter feathers are well shown in one
of my Larus ridibundus, in which, judging from a superficial examination
just made, few or no feathers, even at this date, have a normal distal outline,
the barbs showing a symmetrical wear, while, especially on the crown and
upper nape, so many of the proximal barbs are worn away, that the feathers
present the appearance of laterally compressed palm trees, — long naked
shafts surmounted by a few ragged barbs. In each specimen about thirty
early feathers iof the dark spring moult are already in evidence, having
pushed out the winter feathers, measuring from two to five millimeters. If
the winter feathers should prove, (as do the new hood feathers, vide my
article, p. 455) to be subject to an unusual loss of white tips at a certain
time (in the case of the old winter feathers just before they are loosened and
pushed out by the new feathers), the exposure of the distal sooty coloring,
increasing in amount from the forehead feathers back to those of the nape
would result in exactly the increase of area of darker color, as described
by Mr. Bonhote.
But I offer this as tentative and all subordinate to the coming proof,
which Mr. Bonhote or anyone with a captive Gull, a microscope and an
open, unprejudiced mind can undertake.
The radical and (speaking from the standpoint of one moult to the
next) almost immediate change in color of the whole plumage of birds
subjected to new conditions of humidity and abnormal environment which I
am obtaining and shall soon publish, have made me sceptical of evidence
based on one or more feathers in the skins of dead birds. This and other
related problems require continuous and minute examination of the living
bird.
I think that most ornithologists will agree with me, that no more
skilful and thorough study of colour in plumage has been made than that
of Dr. R. M. Strong, of Chicago University, in his &amp;quot; Development of Color
in the Definitive Feather,&amp;quot; {Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology
oj Harvard. Vol. XL., No. 3).
The following is taken from page 176 :
&amp;quot; The arguments against change of color without moult through
repigmentation or regeneration of pigment may be summed up as follows :

1. Most feather pigments are too resistant to chemical reagents to
warrant belief in their solution and redistribution.
2. Pigmentation of the feather has been observed to take place
only in the younger stages of the feather germ.
3. At the end of cornification melanin granules have a definite
arrangement, which is permanent.
4. When cornification has ensued, the various elements of th e

feather are hard, more or less solid, structures and their pigment
contents are effectually isolated from one another.
5. There is no satisfactory evidence of the occurrence of repig-
mentation, and all the histological conditions render such an event highly
improbable.&amp;quot;
And again in Summary, page 178 :
&amp;quot; 16. Changes in color of plumage may take place either (1) by a
moult, during which the new feathers may have the same pigmentation
as their predecessors or a different one ; (2) by a loss of certain portions
of the feather; or (3) by a physicial disintegration in the cortex of the
feathers as the result of exposure.&amp;quot;
The time is past for generalizations and assertions based on superficial
observation of the feathers in either skin or living birds.

ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL.
Sir, — It is now eighteen years since the publication of my little
manual on the swimming birds entitled &amp;quot; Ornamental Waterfowl,&amp;quot; in the
preparation of which I received such kind assistance from Dr. P. S. Sclater,
Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, Mr. Henry Seebohm, and other Ornithologists.
I have been advised to bring out a new edition of the book, and I
would take this opportunity of inviting corrections and criticisms from
those into whose hands the work may have fallen.
My collection of ornamental waterfowl has been broken up for many
years and I have not therefore the opportunity of studying the living speci-
mens, but during this interval many fresh importations must have been
brought to this country and been studied in captivity by your readers. To
these I would appeal for particulars of the rarer species and those imported
since 1888. I would particularize the newly discovered species of Bernicla
hutchinsii (which I believe found their way to the Tring Park collection);
the Black Brent Goose, {Bernicla nigricans) ; Blue-winged Goose, (Bernicla
cyanoptera) ; Red-necked or Red -breasted Goose, (Bernicla ruficollis) ;
Middeudorf&apos;s Goose, (Anser middendorft) ; Caffin&apos;s Snow Goose, (Anser~
albalus); the Emperor Goose, (Anser ca?iagitus) ; the Lesser White-fronted

Goose, (Anser erythropus) ; as also the less well known Whistling Ducks
and Shieldrakes.
I am especially anxious to ascertain whether the Great Australian
Shiel drake, (Tadorna tadornoides) ; the Radjah, (Tadorna radjah), and the
White-fronted Shieldrake, {Tadoma cana), have come into the hands of
any amateurs. I must not occupy your space with a list of all those
respecting which I am anxious for information, hut would appeal to your
readers for assistance in bringing my .handbook up to date by kindly for-
warding an)&apos; particulars on the subject which they may be inclined to
afford me.
Will your readers who have had under observation the Blue-winged
Teal (Querquedula cyanoptera) tell me in what points it differs most markedly
from the Raffle&apos;s Teal. In 18SS the Raffle&apos;s Teal was as yet unknown in our
collection, but a Continental correspondent wrote me that he and a friend
had specimens of the birds and that it had bred in captivity. The same obser-
vation applies to the White-faced Teal also known as the Blue-winged
(Querquedula discors); while I find also that a pair of Raffle&apos;s Teal was-
imported in January, 1S97, by Mr. W. Cross, and this year the well known
importer, Mr. W. Jamrach, writes me that he had between thirty and forty
pairs through his hands in 1900— 1904 of the White faced Teal (Q. discors).
It will greatly assist my publisher, (Mr. W. H. Robinson, Walsall,) if
intending purchasers would signify their names and addresses to him, as we-
have not yet decided upon the size of edition likely to be required.

PROPAGATING MEALWORMS.
In reply to the note on this subject published in last month&apos;s
Avicultural Magazine, Miss Husband has kindly sent us a printed leaflet on
&amp;quot; How to breed Mealworms,&amp;quot; by Mr. Stanley Gordon, of Southsea. Miss-
Husband has followed the directions there given with success.
The following is an extract :
&amp;quot; Procure five or six dozen mealworms or mealworm beetles and a
corn bin which will hold about four bushels (the larger the bin the better).
Cover the bottom of this bin with a layer of turf, grass side downwards,
the earth being nearly dry ; then place a layer of virgin cork on this turf, mix
together a quantity of pieces of rag, with pieces of cork, bran flour or meal of
any kind of grain, about sufficient to half fill the bin ; leave this for about
twenty-four hours to settle down, then place a piece of rough cloth or old
sack over it and on this sufficient meal to cover it entirely over, then place
a similar piece of cloth or sack over the last, covering this and about two
or three similar pieces with meal as they are placed into the bin, then place
another piece of cloth or sack over all, and on this put the mealworms or
beetles : they will quickly disappear under the sacking. This having been

Correspondence. 157
done the whole should be allowed to remain for a few months, when
on gently lifting the top layers of cloth, mealworms will be found feeding
between them.
&amp;quot;The rags, cork etc., and turf under these layers should never be
disturbed, as it is amongst these that the beetles la}&apos; their eggs. Keep the
bin covered, renew the flour or meal on and between these top layers of
sacking occasionally to feed the worms, and they will soon be found in
sufficient quantities to supply any private person&apos;s aviary.
&amp;quot;The bin should be kept in a moderately warm and damp place. A
piece of crumb of bread soaked in beer is a great treat to mealworms, and
if placed on the top layer in the bin will quickly be covered with worms
and beetles and be shortly eaten up by them.
&amp;quot;Mealworms (like silkworms) pass through several stages, first eggs,
then worms, which throw off several skins whilst growing, then chrysalis,
finally developing into beetles, which like silkworm moths, lay their eggs
and die, their eggs being hatched the following season. It is necessary (to
ensure success) to procure beetles from some person who understands the
matter, as the insects are males and females, and some of each should be
obtained.&amp;quot;
Sir, — In answer to Mr. Seth-Sniith&apos;s query as to the propagation of
mealworms, I used to breed them in their thousands years ago, in my early
days of aviculture, but I got out of the way of it somehow, as time went on.
I bought a hundred I think originallj r , and turned them down into a large
biscuit tin, with some tiny pierced holes in the lid, which should be a very
very close fitting one. I placed layers of barley meal and bran between
layers of crumpled-up blotting paper and rags, and scattered the mealworms
in between. The tin should not be more than three-parts full to start with,
because fresh meal must be added from time to time, but should remain
otherwise undisturbed for the best part of a year. It used to be kept on a
shelf in a cupboard by the side of the kitchen range, as warmth is an
essential all the year round. There may be a better way than this now for
this was years and years ago, but, anyway, I found it very successful at the
time.
N.B. — I kept the box carefully tied up in brown paper, I remember,
because &amp;quot;them grubs crawling about the kitchen cupboard&amp;quot; were not
calculated to make one popular in certain quarters. — E. A. H. Hartley.
Sir, — I have been asked to record my experience in breeding meal-
worms. I have been fairly successful, and think that with care and fore-
thought ample mealworms could be bred by the aviculturist, and so a not
unimportant item in the expenses saved.
My mealworms live in a large round wooden drum, half-filled with_
pieces of old soft sacking, brown paper and a good supply of oatmeal.

Ever}&apos; fortnight two or three extra handfuls of oatmeal are added, a small
piece of raw meat and one or two fancy lunch biscuits or half a dog biscuit.
I believe they do equally well in a tin. Some years ago I bought a
tin, with a few mealworms in it and in which they had bred, from an old
naturalist at Dover. What the particular charm about this tin was I do not
know, but the mealworms bred in thousands, and the pieces of sacking
were to be seen covered with tiny mealworms of all sizes.
A great secret is to avoid all damp. Mealworm tins or wooden boxes
left on a stone floor, even in a heated aviary seem to evolve damp and mould
inside, the mealworms die, and moth and rust and small grubs are the only
result.
I keep niy tub near the hot pipes in winter, (failing hot pipes, I
should suggest the kitchen), and on a wooden floor in summer, and I breed
nearly enough for my small needs. Occasionally, when many are needed,
for instance in rearing the young of Starlings, I have had to buy, but this
year I hope even this will not be necessary.
It is annoying that the mealworms nearly all become chrysalides and
eventually beetles about the end of July, when they are most needed.
If large quantities were used a succession of tubs could be arranged,
nearly clearing out one tub before another was commenced, and leaving
perhaps four or five dozen mealworms, not touching this tub, except to
feed, for perhaps six months.
I must add that plenty of ventilation is necessary.

RUTHLESS IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.992419875" page_id="33229140"  page_num="158" year="" vol="">
Sir, — In buying one hundred Leiothrix (Japanese Robins) last month,
I feel I have positively encouraged cruelty. An English bird-dealer
advertised 6000 ! ! at ^5 per 100 for turning out, and in a weak moment I
was tempted to send for a hundred. When they arrived only one was dead,
but the following morning there were fifteen corpses, in spite of my having
attended to the poor birds constantly and carefully from the moment of
arrival ; finally thirty died within a week, the rest are now much stronger.
I had cages (new ones) ready for them ; the best insectivorous food,

given fresh every hour, and the moment drinking water became dirty I
changed it. Moreover, they were left with an electric lamp, giving both
heat and light throughout the night, close to the cages.
Surely if the trappers continue to catch the Leiothrix at this rate,
and the dealers receive them, these birds must gradually be terribly
diminished in their numbers.
Personally I would rather never see a Japanese Robin again than
think that Iain encouraging this thinning of their ranks, and the numerous
deaths amongst the imprisoned birds, as well as the misery caused to them
in the crowded, filthy cages, fighting and struggling literally for their
lives. They have dirty water — soiled food, and more often than not in the
Dealer&apos;s shop, a most horrible and foetid atmosphere to breathe. Rank
poison ! I do not sa)&apos; that this was so in the place from which my birds
came, but it certainly is so in some cases.
One cries out a great deal about the slaughter of birds for women&apos;s
hats, and with reason, for it is a most abominable thing, and gladly would I
snatch off any woman&apos;s hat which flourishes Birds-of- Paradise plumes, heads
of Crowned Pigeons and Egret&apos;s feathers, etc., under one&apos;s nose, and leave
the wearer to go home bare-headed ! ! But I do believe that we who
encourage ruthless importation of birds, are to be equally blamed. They
are caught in their thousauds, and die at any rate in hundreds. Bought at
probably about id a piece, and sold for 1/-.
The catalogue of bird-plumes for the women is sad enough, but when
the Japanese Robins have to slowly die in their &amp;quot; Black holes of Calcutta,&amp;quot;
the sadness is added to, and we are living in glass-houses who encourage
the importations. The dealer from whom I purchased mine assures me
that the mortality has been very small indeed, and considers that if I give
my birds boiled water to drink, I shall have a similar experience.
The Grey Parrots too. That is another instance. How many
thousands have been imported, and how many have died whilst still almost
babies ? I am glad I do not know.
America has set a good example in forbidding for a time the exporta-
tion of certain birds, notably Blue Robins and Virginian Nightingales
(Cardinal Grosbeaks) : and much as I love these birds, I am genuinely glad
to think that many that would be travelling in their dirty prisons to more
often than not equally dirty shops (in England !) are enjoying their liberty
in their native land.
If we can acclimatize birds and give them all the care they should
have, I do believe they are happy ; but we bird-lovers ought not to shut up
our eyes and our consciences to the fact that in creating a demand for
foreign birds (and English ones too for that matter) we are encouraging a
great deal of cruelty and numerous deaths of birds which do not have the
luck to be purchased by us and survive.

Sir, — I expect to go to Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres, and possibly
to Chili, leaving this country on March 29th next. I shall be much obliged
if you will inform me as to the more interesting birds in those localities
which I am likely to see, and for which I should look out.
When I was in India I saw some fine parrots, of which I longed to
bring home specimens, but it was impossible for me to do so, as I was
returning by way of Japan.
At Darjeeling I was offered Peacock Pheasants at 10/- each. As they
can be obtained in India so cheaply, I should have thought it would pay to
import them into England for the price the}&apos; would fetch here.
If there are any of your correspondents who can give me information
as to interesting birds which I am likely to see in South America, and as to
the best way of conveying living specimens to this country I shall be
grateful. William B. Gibbins.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Gibbins :
Of course the insectivorous and fruit-eating birds are by far the most
interesting, although not so easy to feed as seed-eaters. If you wish to
import the former, the true Thrushes are not the most attractive either for
plumage or song, but all the Mocking-birds are fine songsters.
For plumage the Tanagers are all worth importing, and some of them
sing fairly well.
Among the Troupials and Hangnests, the Red-breasted Marsh-bird
(Leistes superciliaris) is well worth importing on account of its rarity in the
bird-market: in colouring, habits and song it is a copy of the commou
Military Starling of the Republic : it can be distinguished from the latter
at a glance by its broad finch-like beak. The Red-headed Troupial is a
handsome bird not very common in the market. The two Argentine Jays
are also worth importing, as well as the Red Oven-bird, but the Tyrants,
excepting from a purely scientific standpoint, are hardly worth the trouble.
Of the seed-eating birds the most satisfactory are naturally those
which are least imported, for it is not worth while to bring home birds
which can be bought in Loudon for two or three shillings. The Yellow-
billed Cardinal, Diuca Finch, Gay&apos;s Finch, Orchard Finch, Alaudine Finch,
Red-crested Finch, Chingolo- and Grey-headed Song-Sparrows, Black-
headed Siskin and Pelzeln&apos;s Saffron-finch are mostly rarely imported birds
and on that account desirable.
Of the Parrots the most frequently imported are the Blue-fronted
Amazon and the Quaker Parrakeet ; the Conures would be better worthy of
attention. The Black-winged Dove would repay the trouble of importation.

Any of the smaller Game-birds which can be readily obtained should be
brought home.
The best cage in which to import birds is one open only in front (a
box-cage in fact) with a muslin blind to draw over it, and tins to slide in in
front for food and water; the perches should run from end to end, and at
the bottom should be a narrow opening along the front into which a sheet
of thick paper can be introduced to catch the droppings and thus keep the
cage clean ; this paper can be renewed without trouble as soon as it becomes
foul. For feeding ^insectivorous birds it would be well to take out a good
supply of &amp;quot; Century Food,&amp;quot; though hard-boiled egg and potato chopped up-
together will answer for a time. A. G. BuTLER.

Sir, — I should be so very much obliged if you could tell me if there
are any definite sexual differences in the case of Coitus striatus ?
I picked up two specimens lately which look much alike. By the
way mine have black throats. Is this Striatus or some allied species ?
Is anything known about the nesting habits of this species ?
W. E. Teschemaker.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Teschemaker :
When I examined the series of Colies in the collection of the
Natural History Museum for my articles on the sexing of Cage-birds
published in &amp;quot; Canary and Cage-bird Life,&amp;quot; I found that the female of the
Striated Coly differed from the male in her longer and broader beak, with
more curved upper mandible, the only difference in colouring which I could
discover was that the crown of her head was paler; rather more ashy.
The throat of the Striated Coly is described as ashy brown with
darker vermiculations (like the upper breast and sides). I forget exactly
what the Black-necked Coly is like, but it might be worth while to look it
up : the sexual difference would probably be similar.
The Colies build small open nests in bushes, using bark, twigs and
weeds for the structure and fresh leaves or fronds for the lining ; they are
supposed to lay from five to seven eggs of a dirty white colour.

has cleared mine and done no harm to anything else. W. H. Foster.
Miss B. McDonald writes : —
&amp;quot;In answer to the request of the Hon. Mary Hawke, perhaps she
would like to know how I have kept my Shama. I have had him now for
eight years, and he is as well now and sings almost better (by day or gas-
light) than when I first had him.
I feed him on the following mixture : equal parts of cooked meat
(never salt meat), hard boiled egg, boiled carrot, breadcrumbs, all ver} r finely
chopped; and on alternate days I give him either Hyde&apos;s or Spratt&apos;s Lark
Food, which he seems very fond of. Also he has four or five mealworms a
day and a bath every day (hike- warm during the winter). I give some ants&apos;
eggs now and then dry, and in the summer he has some live ants&apos; eggs,
which are greatly appreciated, and all the insects I can get, especially blue-
bottles and spiders. I feed all my insectivorous birds in this way, and I
think it must suit them, as I have had one of my Thrushes for eleven years.
The Shama is kept in a large wire flight cage, about 32 inches long
and 18 inches broad, in a warm room, but I always put a flannel cover on
one side of his cage to keep all draughts away. I consider these birds very
hardy, the only thing likely to upset them being draughts and an insufficient
supply of meat and insects.
He has escaped twice since I have had him ; once into the garden,
where he sang all day on top of a fir tree, but at night came back into his
cage of his own accord, not having been able to find any food for himself.
He will always answer me, if I call him by his name, &apos; Ranji.&apos; &amp;quot;

THE SHAMA.
By the Rev. Hubert D. Astxey, M.A.
It is only as a cage bird that I have known the Shama, for
I have never kept it in an aviary, but I think that it is not far off
thirty years ago since I had my first one, and only during short
periods within that time have I been without one. After all, on
first reading, one might say, &amp;quot; What a quantity of Shatnas that
must mean,&amp;quot; yet it might meau three, and has meant only four,
for a Shama will live for ten years at the least in good health and
song. One lived in perfect condition for eleven years, and was
at least a year old when purchased, and then died quite
suddenly, singing beautifully almost to the last moment. The
first one lived for ten years, and my present bird is in full
strength and beauty.
Mr. Phillipps has already recorded in our magazine some
few years back his success with a pair of these birds which
nested and reared up their young, indeed I could have wished
that he might have found leisure moments for writing once more
about them. He has had more experience with the hen birds
than I have, and has studied them in his aviaries. They are
so seldom imported, those softly coloured hens ! A thousand
pities, for they are extremely good to look upon, and their
presence would give some of us an opportunity of seeing a
Shama&apos;s nest and eggs and brood.
How hopeful one always is ! A Hindoo gentleman has
told me that the name &amp;quot;Shama&amp;quot; signifies a dark thunder-clord,
a blue-black cloud which floats up menacingly before the st
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.9803425" page_id="33229152"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
^4. Rev. Hubert D. Astley,
bursts. And so the deep blue-black of the bird&apos;s upper plumage
has been likened to such a cloud, and has called forth its name.
The bird like a thunder cloud. Only the male bird, however,
for his mate&apos;s feathers resemble rather the softer sky of rain,
from which refreshing showers are expected ; a subdued grey, a
mouse-grey, the thunder-cloud has gone, and the gentler one
remains as the garb of the gentler sex.
Thirty years ago a Shama was a luxury — a rara avis — and
cost considerably more than thirty or forty shillings, for which
they can be bought nowadays.
Naturally bold and tame and confiding, with the beauty
of their form and song, they make most delightful cage birds ;
and they will sing nearly the whole year round. A Shama
requires a cage of wooden or cane bars, as do all insectivorous
birds, and he is insectivorous, i.e., he does not eat seed. His food,
like our own, should be varied, indeed besides &amp;quot;treats&amp;quot; in the way
•of insects, such as spiders and flies (though I believe it is highly
incorrect to call a spider an insect !) I give my Shama and other
insectivorous birds at least six ingredients in their daily food.
A deal too much trouble? Well! not if you are really fond of
your birds, and if you are not really so you should not keep
any ! A little heart chopped very fine, which is mixed up with
silkworm cocoons, so that the particles of heart become separated
the one from the other into fragments of a size that can be
picked up and swallowed without the necessity of their being
knocked about by the bird and perhaps messed in the sand.
Then add a little maize meal, not too much, because it has a
fattening tendency. In the winter a slice of apple chopped very
finely can be mixed up with the aforesaid, as also some yolk
■of egg. Then I take some &amp;quot;Iyucullus&amp;quot; (the excellent insec-
tivorous mixture sold by Herr Friedrich Fries, at 8, Louisen
Strasse, Bad-Homburg, v.d. Hohe, Germany) damp it with a
little water, and add it to the rest, so that the whole is rendered
moist without being wet.
In the summer, instead of the chopped apple, chicory
leaves are good, cut finely, or failing that, dandelion or lettuce.
A grape or two, peeled and the pips extracted can be also

chopped up. A sack of silkworm cocoons {bachi da seta) can be
easily procured from Italy. I hear someone say, &amp;quot;Thank you!
No insectivorous birds for me, if that is what it means ! &amp;quot; Yet it
is perfectly easy when once you become accustomed to it, and
keep your food supply in an orderly manner, teaching a trust-
worthy servant how to mix it in the event of your leaving home.
By-the-bye ! Marie biscuit, or any biscuit of that kind, crumbled
up, or a little sponge cake can be thrown in. Give your Shama
a daily bath, measuring the bath to the length of his tail. In the
summer-time when it is warm, hang up his cage under some
shade-giving tree, if you are in the country, where the sunshine
will reach him through the leaves as it would were the bird in
his wild state ; and if warm rain comes, remove his sand
drawer, and put the cage out for a few minutes, for the rain-
drops will improve his plumage and he himself will enjoy it.
The cage can easily be sponged afterwards with a dry sponge, if
it is much wetted.
The Shama, being a native of Indian jungles, would be
sure to like an aviary, probably all to himself and his wife, so
that it need not be a very large one, in which bamboos and thick
bushes were planted. Mr. Phillipps&apos; birds built, I believe, on a
beam under a roof, or on a shelf. With ordinary care, Shamas
are certainly not delicate birds, and can be kept in as good
health and condition as a Blackbird. They are great mimics,
and unfortunately because of that are apt to spoil large portions
of their song, through imitating the chirping of Sparrows and
other oft-repeated and monotonous sounds.

This and the next species are more terrestrial in their
habits than the Moorhen or Coot and feeds largely on slugs and
snails and insects. According to Barnes it breeds twice a year in
June or July and August and September.
2. Amaiirornis phcenicurus. Penn.
The White-Breasted Water Hen.
This is a very well known Indian bird and found by nearly
even* piece of water. It is exceedingly noisy, and its loud harsh
cry which sounds like &apos; Ko rok rok r6k&apos; is often heard day and
night. I once stayed at a house the garden of which was in-
habited by a pair of these birds which kept me awake most of
the night by their cries. They breed during July and August,
making a nest of rushes, placed as a rule near water. They are
most pugnacious birds and I have seen them fighting furiously
with each other. A pair were so engaged 011 one occasion that
I approached to within a short distance of them before they
were aware of my presence.
3. Gallhmla chloropus. L- The Moorhen.
I am of opinion that there are two races of the Moorhen
found in India, namely, the typical G. chlorop?is and a smaller
form the G. parvifrotis or btir?iesii of some writers. Of this
smaller form I once had a considerable number, but unfortunately
as I have no longer the skins to refer to will have to trust to
memory. As far as I can remember they were in colouration
identical with G. chloropus but much smaller, and had a very
small frontal shield. That they were adult birds was proved by
their showing no white on throat and neck, which is a sign of
immaturity in G. chloropus. In Le Messurier&apos;s book &amp;quot; The Game,
Shore, and Water Birds in India,&amp;quot; the author thus describes
G. burnesii or parvifrons : &amp;quot;The small water hen. $ n£&amp;quot; $ n&amp;quot;,
legs olive green. Front plate small or wanting Chin and throat
whiter The italics are mine. Having the chin and throat white
points to immaturity, and these of Le Messurier&apos;s must have

under the genus Amauroi iris, viz., A. bicolor and A. fuscus, but I follow Dr Sharpe in
separating them, that gentleman having referred the former to the genus Porzana and tKe^
latter to Limnobceuus, and I think rightly too, as neither can be classed as &amp;quot;Moorhens.&amp;quot;

been young birds. Blanford, writing in the fourth volume of
birds in &amp;quot;The Fauna of British India Series&amp;quot; makes no mention
of this small water hen, but says, (writing of G. chloropus)
&amp;quot; Indian birds are smaller than European.&amp;quot; I have however
seen some European birds quite as small as the typical Indian
form of G. chloropus, and again Indian specimens as large as
European. Blanford gives the measurements of G. chloropzis
as i2&apos;5&apos; in length. Birds I have measured from England average
from 12 to 13 inches. Blanford ignores altogether one very im-
portant point, namely, the differentiation in sexes. Saunders
states that the female bird is larger and more brightly coloured
than the male, but surely this cannot be the case. I have taken
special pains to investigate this matter and found that the larger
and more brightly coloured bird with the very conspicuous
orange garter was the male, the more sober coloured bird the
female. Dresser says — &amp;quot;Sexes alike.&amp;quot; Of course the bright
colour may be a sign of age, but personally I do not think so, as
I have never found a bright coloured female, and I have dissected
a good many.
Jerdon thus describes Gallinula bumesii : — &amp;quot;Similar to G.
chloropus or intermediate to it and Porzana {Amauromis) akool ;
the head and neck are like those of the Common Water-hen, but
the frontal plate is smaller or wanting ; the outer web of the first
primary is white, and the outermost feather of the winglet is
also bordered with white ; the wing coverts are dark slaty ash ;
and the under tail coverts are white. It is smaller than G.
chloropus ; Tarsus 2^ ; mid-toe 2f ; claws also shorter ; irides
bright pale crimson ; legs and feet as in G. chloropus, but the
orange garter less developed. This species was first discrimin-
ated by Mr. Blyth from a drawing and some fragments of a
specimen sent by Sir A. Burnes, from the Munchur lake in Sindh.
It appears to me rather a doubtful species but I shall retain it in
the hope of other specimens turning up.&amp;quot; {Birds of India iii.
p. 719).
Gallimda bumesii is I think a good sub-species. The key
to the two will be as follows : —
Frontal shield in adults large. Length 12 to 13&apos;. G. chloropus.
Frontal shield small or wa?itinz. Length 11*. G. c. bumesii.

on the Moorhens and Coots of India. 169
Moorhens are found in India almost anywhere where there is any
water, though they show a decided preference for small reedy
ponds thickly overgrown with weeds. When feeding on water
the Moorhen is constantly dipping its head below the surface and
plunges forward with a distinct and audible splash. Common as
the birds are, their nests I have not found easy of discovery.
They breed at such a time when the whole country is covered
thickly with vegetation, and if you wish to find the nest for your-
self it means wading almost knee-deep in water through paddy
fields or else hunting around the edges of ponds among the
undergrowth, and as this is somewhat warm work with the tem-
perature considerably over a ioo°, one&apos;s enthusiasm is apt to be
damped, and nest hunting is left to natives who, also not caring
for the trouble the search ensues, will return after a short time
(which is in all probability spent in their own houses !) saying
that there is no nest, which of course is not surprising. I did,
however, on one occasion find myself in the possession of an un-
doubted nest, and on my handling one of the eggs was surprised
to see the head of a chick appearing, the egg being on the point
of hatching. One nest I knew of was built on a tree quite 15,
feet up, and I wondered how the old bird would have conveyed
her brood to the water when hatched. I have found Moorhens
fair eating, but they must be skinned first as their skins are as a
rule so saturated with oil as to quite destroy the flavour and
render them very nasty indeed. But I imagine few sportsmen
would waste a cartridge on them, especially in a country like
India where so many and much more valuable fowl can be
obtained so easily. The wily native however often passes them
off on some unsuspicious Sahib as &amp;quot; teal.&amp;quot; The Moorhen is not
subject to much variation though pied specimens have been re-
corded from time to time, and the curious &amp;quot; hairy&amp;quot; form is not
uncommon in England, though I am not aware of any Indian
records of this variety.
4. Gatlicrex cinerea Gm. The Water Cock.
The Water Cock is by no means common anywhere in
India, except — as Blanford says — in damp warm and swampy
plains. I saw some specimens once on a large Jheel near Darb-
hanga in Tirhoot, and my friend Mr. C. M. Inglis has procuredr

specimens from the same district. It is said to have a loud
booming cry uttered in the breeding season. It is kept by many
natives for fighting purposes. Its food appears to be chiefly
vegetable. It breeds in July and August, making a large nest of
rushes either moored to reeds or else floating, and the eggs are of
the regular Moorhen type and measure, according to Blanford,
about 17 by 1*27. The horn in the male appears only to be
assumed in the breeding season.
5. Porphyrio poliocephalus, Lath. The Purple Moorhen.
The Purple Coot (Jerdon). &amp;quot; Blue fowl &amp;quot; of Bengal sportsmen.
This fine bird is found throughout the Indian plains where-
-ever there are large sheets of water, and among rice fields, and in
certain localities abounds, only being outnumbered by Coots.
Mr. C. M. Inglis says that at Baghownie in the Darbhanga dis-
trict of Tirhoot, Bengal, they are so abundant as to cause con-
siderable damage to the rice crops as they cut down the plant
wholesale with their powerful bill and pile it up to form their
nests. Large as the bird is it is not often seen, being exceedingly
wary, but its deep cry of &amp;quot;woo — ong &amp;quot; is frequently heard,
especially towards evening and in the breeding season. The best
way to obtain &amp;quot;Blue fowl&amp;quot; is to drive them out of their reedy
cover by means of two or three boats in line. They fly low over
the water with a somewhat weak flight and can then be easily
dropped. A wounded bird is seldom recovered as they are ex-
cellent divers. I have always found them good eating, and they
make delicious soup. The breeding season is from July to Sep-
tember, and the eggs vary from six to eight and sometimes ten,
and are a pale pink spotted with red and purplish grey.
6. Fulica atra. L,. The Coot.
The well known Coot occurs in countless numbers on all
Indian marshes, ox J heels as they are called, and lakes. In some
places it is resident, but only a cold weather visitor to others. A
favourite shooting ground of mine was a large Jheel situated close
to the Tirhoot State Railway in Bengal. Standing on the road
alongside ihef/iee/, at sunset, one heard the whistle and rush of
many wings caused by huge flocks of waterfowl which came there
to feed. The commonest bird was the Coot which simply swarmed
in thousands. On a bitterly cold morning in December, about 4

a.m., four of us started for t\\\s Jheel to shoot, knowing that before
the sun was well up was the best time to get anything. I must
admit it was with some reluctance we left our warm beds, and
after hastily dressing and swallowing a cup of tea, mounted our
horses and rode off; our servants having gone on ahead with our
guns and ammunition. The day was just dawning as we arrived
at the Jheel side, and clouds of mist were rising off the water.
Our boats were the ordinary country &amp;quot;dug outs&amp;quot; and leaked
horridly. However making our boatmen fetch us a heap of
straw we lined the bottom of the boats with this and made our-
selves as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. A
confused murmur of sounds reached our ears out of the fog, and
as the now rising sun caused the banks of mist to lift and roll
away we could see a goodly company of fowl including thousands
of Coots. Stealthily creeping up in line, on passing a clump of
rushes a few teal were flushed and a right and left dropped a
couple. The noise of the guns broke the spell, which was
answered by a roar of wings, as the ducks now alarmed rose in
every direction. The Coots merely fluttered a short distance
then settled again, and it was not until more shots had been fired
that they left the water finally and circled round the boats with
quickly beating wings. The fun now became fast and furious,
alternate duck and coot were dropped, until at length tired of
slaughter a truce was called.. The majority of Coots were given
to the boatmen, only a few being reserved by ourselves for soup.
Let anyone beware how he handles a wounded Coot, for these
birds will scratch like a cat, very often inflicting a nasty sore
place, as I know to my cost.
Natives snare numbers of Coots by means of nets. The
wretched birds have their legs then broken to prevent them
escaping, and are sold alive in the Bazaars until death mercifully
intervenes and puts an end to their sufferings. Coots are very
pugnacious birds, especially in the breeding season, when rival
males can be seen chasing each other away from their own
special part and fighting furiously. A very handsome bird the
Coot looks in fighting attitude, as with raised wing and all its
feathers puffed out it dashes at its opponent in true pugilistic
style. They are not adepts at diving and a wounded bird in cleat—

water is soon recovered. They dive without the preliminary
jump so characteristic of many water fowl and disappear without
a ripple, bobbing up again like a cork. Sometimes a large fish-
ing Eagle will cause much consternation among a flock of Coots
by hovering over them : they then all huddle together for mutual
protection. The alarm note of the Coot sounds like chink chink,
and may be fairly imitated by knocking two coins together.
7. Heliopais personaia. Gray. The Masked Finfoot.
This rare and curious bird has been referred by Blanford
to a distinct family {HeliomithidcB) but has been included by older
writers with the Rallidce to which family it bears resemblance in
the form of the bill and foot, the latter being lobed like a Coot&apos;s.
It differs, however, from the Rails in that it is said to have only
two young which are hatched naked and helpless.
Mr. E. C. Stuart-Baker has shown that this bird has &amp;quot;a
tiny fronted shield and a yellow horn or fronted wattle about \&amp;quot;
long and which appeared to be erect during the bird&apos;s life.&amp;quot;
Blanford makes no allusion to this horn or shield, and as Mr.
E. C. Stuart-Baker no doubt rightly presumes it is only seasonal.
The eggs are at present unknown. Blanford says : — &amp;quot; This very
curious bird has been found on the sea coast, in swamps, and on
rivers and mountain streams. . . .&amp;quot; According to Davison &amp;quot; it
swims deep in the water, with only head and neck above the
surface ; it runs quickly, holding its body in a peculiar way at an
angle to the ground of about 45 . It is shy, and when disturbed
takes refuge in cover or flies up, slowly at first but strongly when
fairly on the wing.&amp;quot;
THE BUFF LAUGHING KINGFISHER.
Dacelo cervina, Gould.
A very fine specimen of this rare bird, the &amp;quot; Laughing
Jackass,&amp;quot; of North-Western Australia, which differs from the
common Laughing Jackass of New South Wales chiefly in its
more buff-coloured plumage, has recently been deposited in the
London Zoological Gardens by Mr. Walter Rothschild, no speci-
men having been exhibited there since 1870. This bird was

reared from the nest and brought to this country by the enter-
prising firm of importers of Australian animals, Messrs. Payne
and Wallace, of the Little Zoo., Bath, and they have very kindly
supplied the following notes on the bird and the block from
which the illustration is printed :
&amp;quot; The example of Dacelo cervina, which has recently been
placed in the Zoo, was taken from its lofty nest by one of our
natives. It was taken from a tree on the banks of the Ord
river which separates North- West Australia from the Northern
territory of South Australia. There were two taken from the
nest, but unfortunately one of them got killed on our Kangaroo
Farm at Wild Dog Creek (N.W.A.) where they used to run about
in the Paddock where the kangaroos are kept. They were so
tame that they did not attempt to fly away. The one that was
killed met its end by being trodden upon by a kangaroo.
&amp;quot;Their nesting place is generally in a hollow limb of the
gum tree and as high as they can possibly get. We always
found them useful as time-pieces, if there were any in the
district, for just before dawn and again at sunset they would
seem to put their whole energy into their thrilling call, which
can be heard for miles in the silent bush.
&amp;quot; It is rather curious that these Kingfishers should spend
the greater part of their time in the dry forest country. During
the wet season, which lasts practically from January to March,
they inhabit the swampy country where they get their food
supply in the way of frogs, newts, &amp;c, but strange to say we
very seldom saw them &apos;skimming the water.&apos; The other nine
months of the year is, as we said before, spent in the dry
country where they live on small lizards and snakes. In fact any
living thing which is small enough will be swallowed. When
catching lizards and the like, they make good use of their bills.
They wait on the branch of a tree, keeping an eye open for any
thing in the vermin or reptile line that can be eaten. If a lizard
makes its appearance down swoops the Kingfisher, with closed
wings, like a stone, and spears the lizard with its pointed bilk
Back he goes to the trees and starts banging the lizard on the
branch, until the life is knocked out of it, and then it goes down
the &apos;cavity&apos; whole. They are very fond of mice and the ene_—

these.
&amp;quot; They are very beautiful in their adult plumage. We have,
on several occasions, caught the adults but we could never save
them. The bird which forms the subject of these notes is about
two years old, and to the best of our belief it is the only living
specimen in Europe. It happened that when we sent this bird
to the Zoo. we sent at the same time a kangaroo which was also
the only specimen of its kind in England, if not in Europe.
&amp;quot;The photograph of the bird was taken just before it
commenced moulting and it was not in good feather, but now
it is in splendid colour.&amp;quot;

CHEQUERS AND BARS IN PIGEONS AND THE

<bodyText confidence="0.99814547368421" page_id="33229164"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
By Prof. C. O. Whitman.
In a review^ of my paper, &amp;quot;The Problem of the Origin of
Species,&amp;quot; Dr. A. G. Butler comments as follows 011 my con-
clusion that the bars in Pigeons have been evolved from
chequers : — &amp;quot; This is certainly not the conclusion to which a
study of the nestling plumage of some at least of the African
Doves leads me, inasmuch as the conspicuous spots on the
scapulars and inner secondaries appear in the adults with the
disappearance of the juvenile bars.&amp;quot;
I presume that the Maiden Dove (Calopelia puella),
recently described f by Dr. Butler, was one of the &amp;quot;African
Doves &amp;quot; he had in mind. This species is pictured as having only
three &amp;quot; metallic spots on the inner greater wiug-coverts and
largest scapulars.&amp;quot; An immature bird described by Captain
Shelley in 1883 {Ibis, p. 322), is referred to as having &amp;quot; black
bars on the scapulars, wing-coverts and secondaries.&amp;quot;
These &amp;quot; black bars &amp;quot; of the young are not further described,
and I am therefore in doubt as to whether they represent rows of
chequers, or the higher stage of development seen in apical

crescents, * a form characteristic of the Inca Dove and most
of the Geopelias.
The mature color-pattern in Calopelia does not differ
widely in essentials from those seen in some American species,
e.g., the Mourning Dove {Zenaidura carolinensis) and the
Zenaida Dove {Z. amabilis). In the young of these Doves, we
find many typical chequers, more or less evenly distributed over
the whole wing ; in the adult we have only a few of these spots
left, and left in the same region in which the three spots of the
Maiden Dove are located. The obliteration of the spots in the
American birds has, however, not yet been carried quite so far
as in the African Dove. In the mature Mourning Dove, we find
not only a larger number of visible spots, but also ma,7iy concealed
vestigial spots. Zenaida has carried the reduction of spots some-
what further, and stands only a little behind the Maiden Dove.
Our White-winged Pigeon (Melopelia leucoptera) has practically
completed the deletion of spots, only a very few vestigial traces
being discoverable in a single specimen obtained from Jamaica.
I do not find such vestiges in White-wings from Mexico and
Arizona.
In a Cape Dove $ (CEua capensis) that has just come to-
hand, I find indications of a still closer correspondence to the
Zenaida and Zenaidura types. In this dove there are two very
short bars, one on the tertials (with one spot on the right wing„
and two on the left), and another on the inner long coverts (with.
three spots on the right wing and jour on the left). These black
(&amp;quot;steel-blue&amp;quot;) spots are sub-terminal squarish blocks on the
outer webs. On the inner webs of the tertials bearing the bar-
spots, I find elongate black spots, which are reduced to ?iarrow
marginal streaks in most cases. A tertial with such a streak on
the inner web, extending nearly to its tip, and a bar-spot on its
outer web, at a considerable distance from the tip, presents a
picture quite characteristic of the Zenaidas and the Mourning
Doves.
So close and peculiar a parallel in the mature patterns of
these doves would lead us to expect fully as close a resemblance
in the juvenal patterns; but Salvadori&apos;s description of the young

176 Prof. C. O. Whitman,
-Cape Dove does not confirm this anticipation. &amp;quot;The wing-
coverts,&amp;quot; as he reports, &amp;quot; are greyish-brown with blackish bands
and whitish buff apical spots.&amp;quot;
According to Dr. Butler (Avic. Mag., N. S., Vol. II., p. 101).
the young Tambourine Dove (Tympa?iistria tympanistrid) is
similarly marked : &amp;quot; All the feathers of the wing and tail are of
a bright coffee-brown color, with broad subterminal irregular
transverse black bands.&amp;quot; The figure given in a later volume of
the same magazine (Vol. IV., p. 308), makes it clear that the
young Tambourine rises to a stage of irregular cross-bars analo-
gous to what is seen in the young Inca Doves (Scardafella inca)
and Geopelias, in which we find the feathers edged apically with
a pale straw-color (very narrow in Inca but conspicuous in Geop-
elias) followed within by a blackish crescentic bar, and then one
or more quite irregular pale buff &apos;bars&apos; (too irregular to be
described as bars — mere suggestions of bars). In the mature
state, the pale apical bar is lost and the blackish crescentic bar
becomes terminal.
This form of barring (so far as the black crescent is con-
cerned), as I intend to make clear at another time, is something
later in evolution, than the lateral chequers of the Mourning
Dove, Passenger Pigeon etc. In young Geopelias we have
transient lateral chequers in the tertials and longer wing-coverts,
and in such continuity with the black crescents that the latter
must be regarded as derived from the former. Even in domestic
pigeons we frequently see chequers reduced to black crescents.
In the young Inca Doves, these same transient chequers
are recapitulated on the tertials and the long coverts. Although
-not so black as in the Geopelias, they are yet plain and un-
mistakable homologues. Only two or three of the inner long
coverts have this vanishing chequer as a long lateral streak on
both the inner and the outer edge of the feather. On the remaining
feathers of the row the mark appears only on the outer web, and
becomes weaker and narrower as we descend the row, until on
the outer two feathers it is wholly lost. The recapitulation of
these marks in the Inca and its South American allies, and again
in all the Geopelias of Australia, even in the Diamond Dove,
standing at the extreme upper limit of evolution thus far reached

in this interesting genus, gives us a very important link in the
sequence of phyletic stages.
I venture to predict that the young Tambourine, the
young Cape Dove, and some of their nearer allies, will be found
to have more or less plain traces of the transient marginal
streaks seen in the tertials and long coverts of the Iuca Dove, and
perhaps also dull spots on the outer webs anticipating the spots
of the adult.
Without going into the evidence here, I may say that I
have fully satisfied myself that lateral spots or chequers are
derived from the Turtle-Dove spots, such as are still seen in T.
orientalis, and, in a somewhat reduced form, in the European
Turtle Dove (T. turtur). The mode of derivation was by split-
ting the original central spot in halves. The splitting began at
the apex of the feather, a short-wedge-shaped area of lighter
color (i. e. reduced in pigment) appearing at this point, and ex-
tending more and more inward along the shaft, until the divided
halves became two separate spots or chequers, more or less
pointed at the distal end. The feather thus became double-
spotted. Typical * wedge-shaped areas &apos; are not rare in domestic
pigeons with the chequered pattern, aud they are very character-
istic marks in the wing of the Guinea Pigeon (C guinea), where
they are described as &amp;quot; triangular white spots.&amp;quot; They are seen
again as a specific character in the Spotted Pigeon (C. macidosd)
of South America. They occur also again in the scapulars of
Columba albipennis of Peru and Bolivia.
This simple mode of converting the Turtle-Dove spot into
a pair of lateral chequers is carried out most perfectly in the
posterior scapulars and in the inner secondaries and large
coverts of the wing of the domestic pigeon. As we pass down-
ward towards the lower (outer) edge of the wing, the chequer on
the inner web diminishes in size more or less rapidly, and usually
vanishes before we reach the middle of the wing. The chequer
on the outer web, which lies exposed, diminishes less rapidly,
aud may be continued to or near the outer edge of the wing.
Now chequers are the elements out of which wing-bars
arise. Rows of chequers, as we see them in the young Mourning
Dove, or in the young Passenger Pigeon, or in the chequered—

178 Prof. C. O. Whitman,
Rock Pigeon (C affinis) may of course be called &apos;bars&apos; ; but in
that case we have to remember that they are yet a long way from
the finished bars of such birds as C. livia, the Bleeding Heart
(Phlogcenas), main&apos; Peris teres, and nearly all pigeons with bars in
the adult plumage. So long as the whole wing remains more or
less uniformly marked with distinct lateral spots, confusion may
be avoided by describing it as spotted or chequered. C. affinis
has been so described, and Ectopistes, which has rows of spots
both in young and adult stages, is never described as a barred
pigeon. American and European ornithologists have general^,
I believe, adhered to this mode of description. Salvadori, for
example, in his Catalogue of Pigeons, speaks of Ectopistes as
having &amp;quot;scapulars, tertials, and median wing - coverts with
velvety - black spots,&amp;quot; and of Chamoepelia as &amp;quot;marked with
blotches of a steel-blue with violet reflections.&amp;quot; In all typical
Turtle-Doves we have rows of spots, but we never think of des-
cribing them as bars. The distinction between spots and bars
has become so fixed in the breeders&apos; terminology, that I did not
realize the danger of any confusion or misunderstanding on this
point before reading Dr. Butler&apos;s very courteous review. Had it
been possible to illustrate my paper with plates, my meaning
would probably have been clear in regard to the evolution of
wing-bars from chequers, at least in so far as concerns the Rock-
Pigeons and their descendants.
The typical wing-bar of the adult bird, as I conceived it,
represents a specific regional mark, a continuous band of color
on a uniform ground of contrasting color. In such a bar, the
individualities of the elements are submerged in the individuality
of the bar. When, therefore, as in C. affinis, we meet with rows
of chequers, and find that the posterior two rows are the homo-
logues of the two black bars of C. livia ; and further, that this
two-barred condition is reached in domestic birds through the
obliteration of the anterior rows of chequers, and by cutting
down the chequers in the remaining two rows to outlines that in
each row flow together a single band, we are warranted in saying
that bars are evolved from chequers.
If we speak of the original rows of chequers as bars,
then it becomes necessary to distinguish between juvenal or

primary bars, or adult or secondary bars. The fact of derivation
remains the same. If we find cases in which the deletion of spots
has been carried still further, until only a few of the larger spots
in the posterior row remain, as in Zenaida and Zenaidura, we
may then say that &apos; bars &apos; have preceded spots. But in this case,
the &apos;bars&apos; are only rows of chequers, and the permanent &apos;spots&apos;
are the true homologues of typical bar-elements in other species.
I believe that the few spots in the wing of the adult
Calopelia are such homologues, and that they are preceded in the
juvenal plumage by corresponding marks which have been over-
looked. I am aware that in the young of this species, the
scapulars, wing-coverts, and tertials are said to be &amp;quot;barred with
black.&amp;quot; These juvenal bars are probably of the same nature as
those seen in the young Tambourine, the relation of which to
chequers has already been indicated.
Although it may now be sufficiently clear that my view
does not stand in contradiction with Dr. Butler&apos;s observations on
African doves, it may not be amiss to pursue the subject a little
further.
Specific characters often appear to come in suddenly and
to be immutable. This seems often to be so in passing from the
juvenal to the mature plumage, with one or several moults. The
earlier color-pattern is often succeeded by one so different that
we are puzzled to see any possible way of continuous differentia-
tion from one to the other. Here, if anywhere, we should expect
to see the mutationist triumphant. His biometric curves would
surely declare gaps in abundance beyond the span of any con-
ceivable bridges. Just as surely is he a too-willing believer in
miracles. The supposed breaks in continuity between stages are,
at least in many cases, only discontinuities in observation.
It is the history of specific characters that turns apparent
discontinuities into continuities; the lack of it that multiplies
mutations into premutations, and premutations into hypothetic
pangens. Complete histories are indeed rarely attainable, but so
much the more significant are they, if just so far as they can be
established, they remove all necessity for resort to mutation
hypotheses.
In illustration, I will take the case of the little Diamond

180 Prof. C. O. Whitman,
Dove {Geopelia cuneata), of Australia. In passing from the
juvenal color-pattern to that of the adult, we seem to pass to a
pattern that is wholly new, and without transitional phases. It
looks like an unpremeditated jump, such as we should expect in
biogenetic recapitulation, if mutation were the law of the origin
of species. In the adult bird we have a grey ground with the
coverts of the wing very regularly marked each with two white
dots, one on each side of the feather, equidistant from the apex.
In the young bird we have no white dots, but some irregular
cross-lines (&apos; bars&apos;) of a light color. How can we pass without a
jump from one pattern to the other?
A very simple experiment will show how this may be
done. All we have to do is to pull out a few of the juvenal
feathers at suitable intervals of time. Their places will soon be
filled by new feathers of different ages, and these will give inter-
mediate stages in the transformation of the cross-lines of the
young into the white dots of the adult. The adult pattern is
thus revealed as an end-stage of a continuous process of differ-
entiation. The same experiment may be made in other species
with similar results.
The pigeons, wild and domestic, present a considerable
number of specific characters, the histories of which can be
traced with exceptional fullness, sometimes in great detail. In the
wing-bars, for example, where we have, not oiie such character
merely, but many, it is possible to read the several histories with
much greater fullness and certainty than would be the case if
they occurred only in single species.
In the genesis of these bars it is possible to see that
natural selection has not been the primary factor, and that mu-
tation, as defined by De Vries, has not been required either as
primary or secondary factor. It is only on Darwin&apos;s hypothesis,
that bars came first and chequers afterwards, that mutation
would find a locus sta?idi. But origin de novo is an entirely inad-
missible hypothesis, when we can trace the history of the bars
back to remote ancestral foundations.
The mutationist is compelled to take his stand on immut-
able unit-characters. A character may fluctuate to and fro, but
it never loses its balance, except by a sudden transformation that

on the Direction of Evolution. 181
makes it a wholly new character, and its bearer a new species.
To the mutationist the bars of Columba livia, both as a whole
and in their component elements, would be viewed as essentially
fixed units. As we look at the character in the mature state, it
seems a perfect picture of immutability. To reach such a definite-
ly localized and apparently rigid character, it might seem that
evolution had come to a halt, that the character was caught in a
mutation trap, from which there could be no escape. But even
while we are looking at this picture, the self-same process that pro-
duced it may be preparing another picture to appear after a moult
in more or less different guise. Can a single individual mutate
from plumage to plumage, i.e., become a new species?
When we look around among allied species and see these
same bars reduced to about half dimensions in the Rock Pigeons
of Manchuria (C. rupestris), reduced to mere remnants of two to
six spots in the Stock Dove(C cenas), carried to complete obso-
letion or to a few shadowy reminiscences in the secondaries in
C. rufi?ia of Brazil, gone past return in some of our domestic
breeds and in many of the wild Columbse — when we see all these
stages multiplied and varied through some four to five hundred
wild species and one to two hundred domestic breeds, and in
general tending to the same goal, we begin to realize that they
are not to be regarded as permanent halts, but rather as slowly
passing phases in the progress of an orthogenetic process of
evolution, which seems to have no fixed goal this side of an
immaculate monochrome — possibly none short of complete
albinism.
Even in cases where natural selection has probably played
a conspicuous part in modifying and beautifying these marks,
e.g., in the Crested Pigeon of Australia (Ocyphaps lophotes), we
find that the reducing process has not been brought to standstill.
Indeed, a careful comparison of the juvenal and adult plumages
in both sexes, shows that differentiation has been gradual and
continuous, and that it is still in progress in the bar of the long
coverts, the homologue of the anterior bar in the Rock Pigeons.
What we now see going on in this bar, has already been achieved
in the White-bellied Plumed Dove* (Lophophaps leticogaster^oi

THE ORIGIN OF BENGALESE.

<bodyText confidence="0.974286172413793" page_id="33229172"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
I beg to add my mite of information regarding this
question. At the end of October last I wrote a letter on this
subject, and was typing it out when I noticed things in the aviary
rather at variance with what I had written, so did not send it off.
However I now send in the letter as it was then written, adding
notes to it.
Having just received Mr. Finn&apos;s Garden and Aviary Birds
of India and also the October number of the Avicultural Magazine \
I feel constrained to give my experiences, which incline me to
agree with Mr. Finn in thinking that the Bengalese had its
origin in Urolonclia acuticauda.
In Bombay, in January 1901, I made my first acquaint-
ance with the Sharp-tailed Finch (though I did not know it by
that name then), and immediately thought of the original Ben-
galee and took the only two offered for sale. Fortunately they
turned out a pair. I also took four Striated Finches, but there
were no Bengalese procurable, worse luck. These birds I kept
till I went to Chitral in September, 1902. U. striata made no-
attempt at nesting in a large aviary cage, and only got so far as
eggs in the aviary. U. acuticauda made several good attempts in
both places, only being prevented from fully rearing young by
my having to move house. The two species did not chum up-
together. On my return in December 1903 they &amp;quot; were not.&amp;quot;
In December 1904 I obtained four more examples of £/.
striata and six Bengalese, but no specimens of U. acuticauda.
These birds were all turned out in an outdoor aviary that May.
The Bengalese were two pairs and two hens and reared some
normal young. There were at least two cocks among the Striated
* A detailed account of this case is now in preparation.

Finches, but they did not chum up with the Bengalese, nor did
they make up to the odd hens. One pair of U. striata did attempt
to nest, but got no further than eggs. A chocolate cock and a
fawn hen Bengalee — (please take &amp;quot; and white &amp;quot; as understood
after the words fawn or chocolate throughout when applied to
Bengalese) — had three young ready to leave the nest in early
February 1906. One was chocolate, one fawn, and the third
looked exactly like U. acuticauda.
In April 1906 I got some more examples of U. acuticauda
and some more U. striata in mistake for Bronze-winged Manui-
kins. By that time the &amp;quot; wild&amp;quot; Bengalee was quite indistinguish-
able from U. acuticaiida. The Sharptails at once chummed up
with the Bengalese, but the Striated Finches had nothing to do
with either of them. I kept careful watch. The latter are now
three less than in April, while the Sharptails apparently number
nine more ; the increase is accounted for as follows : three from
pure U. acuticauda, two (more) from Bengalese, and four from
Bengalese-Sharptail.
The wild type is on the increase, and I have no doubt that,
left to themselves, the Bengalese proper would become extinct in
my aviary. There are now in the aviary eggs or young in five
nests, of which the part or whole proprietors are Sharptails, at
any rate to look at. Of course this tendency to throw back to
the wild type may be only temporary owing to the birds being
rather exhausted with previous efforts. In each case the wild
type has appeared in the third or fourth nest in rapid succession.
I do not know that the theory that exhausted parents are liable
to throw back is correct, but I have noticed a similar thing with
White Java Sparrows, with three pairs last season (October to
March). The first round produced very white young with only
one or two badly pied. The second round produced only a few
white, a good many badly pied and a few almost grey. The
third round produced nearly all grey birds, which, when young,
were like the wild type, but, after the moult, nearly all were
lightly marked with white. As I am shortly going into camp for
over a couple of months I regret I shall not be able to watch
them this breeding; season.

184 Capt. G. B. Perreau,
My reasons for believing Uroloncha acuticauda to be the
ancestor of the Bengalee are as follows: —
U. acuticatida breeds fairly freely in confinement, while
U. striata does not. The former is less timid as regards nesting
and is hardier than the latter.
In my opinion the chirp, song, shape, and postures of U.
acuticauda, more nearly than those of U. striata, resemble those
of Bengalese.
Two pairs of pure (as far as I know) Bengalese have thrown
back to U. actiticauda, and the tendency at present in my aviary
is for U. acuticauda to become the sole type, though I must say
that latterly a good many young have been produced of the fawn
type, but with very little white on them.
These points against U. striata are mostly negative, but,
having kept them longer, they had a better chance of showing
affinity to the Bengalee. U. acuticauda both chummed and bred
with the Bengalee, while the U. striata did not.
When starting to type the above I noticed two things
which made me pause, and I continued pausing (for other reasons
as well, quite unconnected with birds) till my return from camp
in January this year. The first was my finding young in a nest
of U. striata, nearly fledged ; I knew they were nesting in a far
corner, but they had been doing that off and on for a long time
without success, so I did not bother about them much. The
second was that my old chocolate cock seemed to be making
advances to a Striated hen. The young U. striata left the nest
before I left for camp ; they differed greatly from young of U.
acutica7tda. The Bengalee-Striated flirtation remained a flirt-
ation only, she was jilted before I left. My census on my return
showed a slight increase of U. acuticauda, and a slight decrease
for U. striata.
I think it probable that the Bengalee may have had
Striated ancestors as well. I only give my experience for what
it maybe worth. Birds, even of the same species, differ a great
deal. Some pioneer, I think Gedney, states that Bengalese are
feeble on the wing; his birds were probably bred in small cages
or their parents were, but now that aviaries are so much more

general, most people know that a Bengalee takes some catching
if the net has to be used. My bought birds, probably imported
from China, were certainly spry on the wing.
I see that Captain Flower has found a record of Uroloncha
acuticauda being common in S.E. China, and that apparently
there is no record of U. striata being found in China at all. Still,
as he points out, information is scanty, and also there is no
reason why Bengalese should not have been produced from some
imported species. I take it for granted that the Bengalee was
produced in China or Japan in spite of the name. I do not think
the native of this country (India) is capable of doing a thing like
this, or why does he not produce Lutinos of certain parrakeets,
which he now obtains more or less by chance from the nests of
wild birds. In my opinion the credit is due to Japan, as they are
called Japani Mtinias by the dealers here. Certainly this name is
also given to striata and acuticauda, but, when pressed, the dealer
will confess that it is done for base trade purposes. The German
name also credits Japan.
As to colour of parents and young, my results are as fol-
lows. I have never had any white ones, and I have not tried two
chocolates together. Two fawn produce a predominance of fawn
with a few chocolate. Two pairs after hard breeding work pro-
duced all fawn with very little white, two of the young had
practically none. So, if the theory of throwing back when
exhausted by breeding too often is correct, fawn ancestry might
be looked for. Chocolate and fawn, as might be expected, pro-
duce both fawn and chocolate, the latter colour rather pre-
dominating. The nearest to white young that I have raised came
from a chocolate and fawn pair. This same pair produced two of
the wild type, and their white-chocolate son was father of the
third also by a fawn hen. The nearly white young produced
progeny less white than themselves.
I think Domestica an excellent name, but naming the
varieties appears unnecessary as the Bengalee is as much manu-
factured as the Canary. And, if ever there should be a chocolate
fawn and white one, how would it be named ? By the way, how
is it that this does not occur ? I believe it is the same with mlee^

I have since received the January Avicultural Magazine
with Dr. Butler&apos;s interesting article on this subject, so must write
a little more, if only to vouch for the fact that U. striata had
nothing to do with the production of the &apos;&apos;wild&amp;quot; Bengalese in
my aviary. My favourite old pair produced two in a two-thirds
husk right against the wire, about four feet off the ground, within
three feet of my chair where I work, read, and spend most of my
spare time carpentering, with one eye on the birds. This pair
have easily recognised marking. The third wild one came from
an equally recognisable pair, and the nest was but little further
off. The Striated Finches are much more timid and only came
near my end to feed.
Bengalese are often given to chummeries, sometimes six to
a nesting place, and occasionally bring up a few young, but I
have found that a properly mated pair is as jealous of intruders
in the nest as a Zebra Finch, except that the latter considers
more of the adjoining territory as his &amp;quot; compound.&amp;quot; All that
the Bengalee requires is that no bird shall come on to his nest or
nest-perch. For breeding results I prefer one pair to three
chummeries.
I have taken such a long time to get this off that I am now
very much tempted to wait for the February Avicultural Magazine
to probably add some more, but I think this is long enough
already, so will finish up with saying that I think Dr. Butler&apos;s
description of his Bengalee-Striated hybrid (?) rather strengthens
the case for U. acuticauda. I only wish to remark that I do not
differ in a captious spirit from Dr. Butler, from whose writing I
have experienced much pleasure.

In Volume IV., N.S. (p. 270), we had the pleasure of
reviewing the first part of this very important work, and now the

Very great care has been taken in the description both of
nests and eggs, and references are supplied to the literature deal-
ing with the subject and to the previous illustrations. The
present part, like the first, contains fourteen coloured plates of
eggs, some containing nearly thirty figures, and the work of both

&amp;quot;THE EARLY EIFE OF LOON CHICKS.&amp;quot;f
Mr. C. William Beebe, the Curator of Ornithology to the
New York Zoological Society is well known for his very careful
observations on birds in captivity, and such observations are of
the utmost importance in the science of ornithology. In the
present paper he gives some notes on the early life of two Eoon
Chicks, Gavia imber, which he reared by hand from the egg.
He arrived at the following conclusions :

&amp;quot; A. It is probable that the young Loons, are, from the first,
fed on whole, not on macerated fish.

&amp;quot; D. The arc of the swimming stroke, in the young chick, is
much more lateral than in the adult bird. This is difficult
to explain and hard to correlate with the idea that Loons

This is an admirable paper and one likely to direct the
attention of the more exclusive among systematic ornithologists
to the indisputable fact that they cannot ignore the labours of
aviculturists without exposing themselves to a charge ot
culpable ignorance, and a liability to blunder in their estimation
of the constancy of specific characters, in their judgment as to
the affinities of genera, and many other points upon which only
aviculturists or resident field-naturalists abroad can inform
them.
It is a cheering reflection to know that many cabinet
workers are beginning to appreciate the value of the observa-
tions recorded by bird-keepers : thus, whereas in the British
Museum Catalogue Hypochcera (the genus containing the Com-
bassou and its allies) was placed between a genus of Waxbills
and a genus of Grass-finches, the notes on the habits of
Hypochoera published by the late Dr. Russ and others, induced
Messrs. Stark and Sclater, and later Captain Shelley, to transfer
the genus to its natural place among the Whydah-birds.
Mr. Seth-Smith rightly says — &amp;quot;there are hundreds of
species represented in our museums, the actual life-history of
which practically nothing is known &amp;quot; ; he proceeds to show that
the private life of many of these can only be studied in captivity ;
that, although much good work can be and has been done in our
Zoological Gardens, the private owners of suitable aviaries,
whose birds are not constantly exposed to the prying observa-
tions of hundreds of visitors, have a. distinct advantage in this

Technical workers in Natural History are too apt to hug
themselves, under the impression that their&apos;s is the only scientific
branch of the science: whereas, could they but appreciate the
truth, they are the men who make the bricks and suggest the
designs for the buildings, in which we study Nature ; we do not
pretend that we can do without them, but they certainly cannot
afford to do without us.
In my old days of museum life I once grievously offended
a colleague, by telling him that it required as much science to-
describe a lady&apos;s bonnet as a new species : that I, who had per-
haps described some five or six thousand new species at that
time, should make such an assertion, he considered rank blas-
phemy; I never could understand wherein I blasphemed, but
then I always preferred a living dog to a dead lion, and eagerly
sought for information respecting the living economy of the
creatures whose dead bodies I arranged and named. Ornithology,
or any other branch of Natural History, includes the living as-
well as the dead ; and the study of the latter only, must necess-
arily be a superficial treatment of Nature. A. G. BuTLER.

with in a country ramble has only to turn up the part which
deals with the birds in the sort of country in which he finds
himself in order to find out what kinds he is likely to meet
with. This arrangement of course prohibits any systematic
classification being adopted in the body of the book, but as the
author rightly considers classification an important item in any
bird-book he has added a sixth part dealing exhaustively with
this subject, and in such a manner as to make it easily understood
by those with no pretension to a knowledge of natural history.
Finally we must not omit a word of praise for the illustra-
tions which are liberally provided. There are twelve coloured
plates, mostly good, some moderate, but all answering their
purpose, namely, rendering the identification of the birds perfectly
easy. Of the 118 photographic illustrations the majority are
excellent, while the outline ; drawiugs of heads and feet in the
chapter on classification are very useful.
Another good point about the book is its small size which
enables it to be easily carried in the pocket — and the price is
only five shillings.
CORRESPONDENCE.
DOVE ACCLIMATIZATION.
Sir, — It may interest some of your readers to know that in
spite of the inclemency of the weather we have two nests of Spotted
Pigeons {Columba maculosa) in the garden. Both are in Araucaria trees.
■One nest contains young birds and the other eggs. The pigeons were
turned out about two j-ears ago.
As you ask for suggestions as to suitable rings for marking birds I
enclose one which was sent me recently and which seems to be a good
pattern. It can be had in smaller sizes.

JACKAL BUZZARDS.
Sir, — You will be interested in hearing that the Jackal Buzzards have
made another nest, and to-day have laid their first egg. I wish I could get our
■Gan nets to follow their example, they seem inclined to nest but will not.

Sir, — These birds bred in my aviary some time during the summer of
1906, but I regret I can give no details. The parents were put into the aviary in
1905, and so far as I know made no attempt to nest. Neither do I know any
more about the following year, save that I lost sight of them for days at a
time (this I was not surprised at, there was so much growth in the aviary).
Some time either late in June or early July I picked up the cock dead, and
it now adorns my cabinet. In October I was astonished to find I had still
two birds of this species, and that there was but little difference between
the two. The only points that appear clear are : (1) It must at any rate
have been hatched prior to the death of the male ; in many species the hen
will rear the young, though if the male dies previous to hatching, the
records of my aviary show that she usually deserts the eggs. (2) The fact
that a young bird was actually reared. Of this there can be no doubt. I
keep most careful records as to incomings and outgoings. I cannot think
but that these must have been bred before, as they have been inhabitants of
aviaries for so long a period, though there have been long gaps during
which none have come to hand. Westjey T. Page.
GOULDIAN FINCHES.
A well-got-up booklet, entitled &amp;quot; Amongst the Birds and Animals
of Australia&amp;quot; has been issued by Messrs. Payne and Wallace of the Little
Zoo., Bath. A member of this firm visits Australia every year to collect birds
and mammals and bring them home for disposal direct to private purchasers.
These trappers have naturally had a great deal of experience with the
Australian birds in their wild state, and some of their observations are most
interesting, for instance, in writing of the Gouldian Finches, they say : &amp;quot; On
an average for every 100 Gouldians we take from the nets, 80 per cent, are
black-heads, 15 per cent, red-head cocks, and only five per cent, red-head
hens. It will be clearly seen that red-head hens are in the minority. Now
the ten red-head cocks have to find mates somewhere, and as there are so
few red-head hens, they have nothing else to do but to pair up with the
black-heads, and this is what they do. In pairing up in this mianner it
seems of little, or no consequence, whether it be a red-head cock and black-
head hen, or vice-versa.. We have seen many cases where they have bee4i_-

mixed, perhaps there have been two red-heads and three black-heads. We
have many times caught the adults of the two varieties, together with their
brood, and in most cases the 3&apos;oung were of both kinds.&amp;quot;
A SAVAGE PHEASANT.
Sir, — I have lately introduced amongst my Cranes a handsome
Swinhoe x Silver cock Pheasant. He is quite tame and has been accus-
tomed to run loose in a garden. A few days ago this bird suddenly rushed at
my Crowned Crane and after chasing him up and down the garden managed
to get his spur into the Crane&apos;s hind toe and nearly severed it off. It bled
very freely so I caught up the Crane and bathed and bandaged the foot.
Which bandage I \\\?iy say he never attempted to peck off but walked about
quietly in it for three days when the wound having healed he pulled it off
— and the toe is well — but the nail has come off. Since, the Pheasant has
tried to attack two male Demoiselle Cranes, but they are so quick, they got
out of his way. Afterwards, he tried to get at my Flamingo which
fortunately was standing in deep water. The Pheasant flew on to some
rocks in the pond and I quite expected to see him swimming in the water.
At last I got him into a run, where I shall keep him shut up, until I have
advice as to whether I shall have his spurs cut off, or partly off, as it seems
a pity to keep him confined in a run when he might have so much liberty.
I should be glad to know if it would hurt or injure the bird and in what
way the spurs should be taken off. My Silver hen Pheasants are accustomed
to run loose from early morning till the}&apos; walk into their runs of their own

COLOUR-CHANGE IN FEATHERS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997441153846154" page_id="33229182"  page_num="192" year="" vol="">
Sir, — While I thoroughly approve of Mr. Beebe&apos;s suggestion as to
marking certain feathers, in certain specific cases, with ink, as a test of
colour-change; I do not consider that this is at all necessary in all cases.
!For instance, in the case of birds which assume strikingly dissimilar
plumages for the breeding-season, it is only necessary to examine specimens
which have died during the assumption of the breeding-plumage and have
thereby fixed the changing colours in their strange transition character in
order to convince the most sceptical.
A short time since I showed skins of Pyromelana franciscana and
■Cyanospiza cyanea to an ornithological friend ; both birds had died during
the assumption of their summer garb : in the Weaver the feathers of the
throat are partly fringed with golden yellow, a few at the sides are all
yellow, fringed with orange ; 011 the breast is one feather tipped with bright

yellow, its inner web white, its outer web buff, another has the outer half
of the inner web black, a few of the black-centred brown feathers on the
back are washed with golden yellow and some of the secondaries have the
brown borders washed with the same colour towards the tips; thus the
winter feathers still retain their character, but are partly suffused with the
summer colouring.
The case of the Bunting is even more convincing, the greater part of
the head and back retains the rufous-brown of the winter plumage
excepting that here and there a feather shows blue on part of the base,
often more so on one web than the other, the flank feathers are more blue,
some of them only still retaining brown tips, and this is also the case with
all the wing-feathers and the upper tail-coverts, but the tail-feathers have
completed their change ; on the underparts the feathers at the sides of the
throat, the whole of the breast and abdomen are blue at base, but otherwise
still retain their winter colours. ,
Well, as my friend said, — &amp;quot;There you are; there is 110 getting away
from evidence like that &amp;quot; whether we understand it or not, in these specific
cases at any rate, we have the change of colour arrested, before our eyes,
and it is no use to insist upon its impossibility. A. G. Butter.

The following letter was zuriiten in reply to a member&apos;s query :
Sir, — Hoopoes in confinement are always difficult subjects. They
appear to require much warmth, although they can support for a short
time considerable cold, but I think that the heat that seems necessary for
them is to an extent dependent on their bodily health. They want plenty
of room, a dry compartment, no farinaceous food, any number of meal-
worms; you cannot overdo them. The only really good Hoopoes I ever saw
that had been long in captivity had practically nothing else. Such grass-
hoppers, leather jackets, etc., as can be provided, with yolk of egg, ants&apos;
■eggs, etc. They require deep gritty soil to keep their beaks in order. They
are very liable to split and curl, but with everything in their favour, even
when kept in their native land, and fed practically on their natural food,
they are not easy to keep long, although they are delightfully tame con-
fiding pets. The natural food of Hoopoes appears to be almost entirely
the larvae of coleopterous insects, but I have seen them eating young
locusts in the hopping stage, also small centipedes.

This is quite true, but it should be remembered that for every pair of birds
seen in activity at least three or four pairs (probably many more) have been
destroyed generally in a very cruel manner. The question should be asked
Does aviculture justify this ?
The bird is highly placed in the order of creation and is con-
sequently endowed with correspondingly sensitive feelings. Imagine,
therefore the suffering of 500 poor Ring-necked Parrakeets which I saw
shut up in a badly-ventilated cupboard (I can call it by no other name)
lighted with a gas jet. Several had died and dirty seed and dirtier water
were provided for the survivors. These birds were being retailed at about
2/- piece. I wish some influential London member of this Society would
call the attention of an Inspector of the R.S.P.C.A. to some such case as
this.
It may be argued perhaps that the above is a case which does not
affect us, as possibly no member would buy these birds. Take another case.
I read an advertisement offering Blue-bonnet Parrakeets at a very reasonable
price. Shortly afterwards, happening to be in town, I visited the shop and
saw one of the most miserable lots of birds it has ever been my ill fortune
to see. Three were dead on the bottom of the cage and I am certain the
remainder could not have been safely sent away to a purchaser.
I would urge every member to do his or her best to discourage this
sort of traffic by absolutely refusing to buy from dealers who keep their
stock 111 such a deplorable condition.
If the Society continues to flourish as it is doing at present would it
not be possible for it to import its ow birds either through foreign
members or agents and so do away with the dealer altogether ? I would
recommend some such scheme to the consideration of members.

(M. castaneithorax) &apos;.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Within recent years at least few birds have caused quite
such a sensation in the avicultural world as the Yellow-ruraped
Finch, the Munia flaviprymna of Gould. In the Avicultural
Magazine for May 1905, I recorded the history of the species so
far as it was then known, and I called attention to the fact that
before the arrival, in 1904, of the first living specimen in Europe,
the species was only known by some two or three museum
specimens. Thanks however to that enterprising collector,
Mr. Payne, of Messrs. Payne and Wallace, who is probably
responsible for all the living Yellow-rumped Finches that
have reached this country, the species may now be observed in
the aviaries of numbers of aviculturists in this country.
Since my short paper, above referred to, Mr. W. E.
Teschemaker has contributed an exhaustive and most interesting
article to our pages (Feb. 1907) describing the successful rearing
of young of this species and also its near ally M. castaneithorax.
The object of the present contribution is to describe a
remarkable change of plumage which takes place in a small
percentage of adult examples of Munia flaviprymna, a change
for which no satisfactory solution appears to be at present
forthcoming:.

196 Mr. D. Seth- Smith,
The two species that we are concerned with in this paper,
and which are illustrated in the accompanying plate (figs. 1
and 4), are undoubtedly very closely related indeed ; their song
is identical, and the young cannot be distinguished until three
weeks old (Teschemaker), although their actual markings when
adult are very dissimilar. M. flaviprymna* with its sandy-
coloured plumage appears to be a desert form inhabiting the
more interior parts of North-West Australia while M.
castaneithorax is found nearer to the coast, as has been pointed
out by Mr. Teschemaker, and, according to Mr. Payne in his
large experience in trapping these finches, he has never noticed
them to differ in the least from their normal plumage.
I have had altogether nine examples of M. flaviprymna;
the first reached me in the summer of 1904, and was the first
specimen to reach this country alive. Then in 1905, when the
first large batch arrived, I secured four others (on March 21st),
and did not get any more until the present year (1907).
In October 1906, I first noticed that one of my specimens,
flying in a very large open aviary, had commenced to assume
an abnormal phase of plumage, (see figure 2), the throat had
darkened considerably and there were very distinct traces of a
dark pectoral baud. About the same time an example at the
Zoological Gardens developed the same peculiarity, but not, I
believe, to such an extent. On comparing my specimen with
a skin of Munia castaneithorax it was evident that the change
that was taking place was distinctly in the direction of that
species. I may state that there was no example of M.
castaneithorax in the aviary, so it could not have been a hybrid
bred there, but must have been there since the early part of 1905,
and was probably considerably over two years of age. I mention
this because there is a theory that these abnormally marked birds
are hybrids, a theory I find difficult to accept as I shall presently
show.
Early in the present year (1907) I wrote to Messrs. Payne
and Wallace asking if they had any Yellow-rumped finches
which exhibited this peculiar phase of plumage, and they sent

me three specimens, two of which resembled figure 2, but the
third has gone a stage further in the direction of the assumption
of the plumage of M. castaneithorax, and is illustrated in figure
3 of the accompanying plate. As will be seen, the throat has
darkened very considerably, the pectoral band has commenced
to develop and there is a dark spot on the flank.
Now as to the cause of this abnormal state of colour-
ing. Mr. Teschemaker believes that these birds are hybrids
(page 117) and at first this would appear to be a very reasonable
solution of the puzzle, but there is one great difficulty in
accepting this theory. Most of the smaller Passerine birds
assume their adult plumage at a fairly early age. In the case
of M. castaneithorax Mr. Teschemaker tells us that a young bird,
at six weeks old was &amp;quot;showing already the chestnut breast&amp;quot;
though it was slow in assuming the complete adult plumage.
At four months old it was not quite in the mature stage of dress
though nearly so, but. although he does not tell us so, it would
be pretty safe to assume that at six months of age it would be
indistinguishable from its parents. A somewhat shorter period
seems to elapse between the time of hatching and the assumption
of the adult plumage in M. flaviprymna.
It would seem to be reasonable therefore to suppose that
hybrids between these two species would assume their adult
plumage, in which traces of the parentage on both sides would
be shown, at six months of age or less. With the specimens now
under consideration however no trace of the characteristic
markings of M. castaneithorax made an appearance until the
birds were from two to three years of age, before which they
were absolutely typical examples of M. flaviprymna. I am
■greatly hoping that Mr. Teschemaker, who is so very successful
in breeding Australian finches, will, during the present season
produce some hybrids between these two species which would
throw considerable light on this subject. If he does so I
prophesy that they will closely resemble figs. 2 and 3 in the
.accompanying plate, but they will assume this plumage when
from four to six months of age.
My own theory is that M. flaviprymna is merely a desert
form of M. castaneithorax which, to fit it for its desert life has

198 Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
gradually lost the conspicuous markings of the latter. The
changed conditions of a life in captivity and a more humid
atmosphere however cause it, to a certain extent, to reassume
the markings which it has lost on account of its desert life. . Of
course only a vei&apos;y few examples, perhaps not more than one per
cent, ever do change colour.
Whatever the true explanation of the change may be, it
seems to me that the two forms are not distinct species, but only
local races, and in classification, are only entitled to be ranked
as sub-species.
THE NESTING OF SERIN US ANGOLENSIS.
By W. E. Teschemaker.
Last summer one of our members brought home with him
from the Transvaal seven Yel low-rum ped Serins, and four of
these came into my possession on the 23rd of August. As their
former owner informed me that two of those he imported sang
very well on the voyage home, whereas mine did not sing, I
concluded that the two males were not amongst those sent to me
so I ended by acquiring all seven.
The Yellow-rumped Serin is easily described ; it only
differs from the Grey-singing Finch in having a yellow rump..
As autumn nesting always seems to end in failure— and
often in disaster — I kept the Serins indoors in a large flight cage
until the 7th January (last), when I turned out one pair in a very
small heated house and the remainder in an outdoor aviary.
Although we had our full share in Devonshire of the
memorable cold snap at the end of Januar}&apos;, the first mentioned
pair of Serins soon went to nest and commenced to sit on the 6th
of February on three eggs. I examined these eggs at a distance
of only a few inches but, for all that, I will not venture to des-
cribe them, as my experience is that one is likely to make the
most ridiculous mistakes in the matter of the colour of eggs
unless one has them actually in one&apos;s hand and in a good light.
I have since seen two more clutches of eggs of this species. The
three eggs in one clutch were of a light blue ground colour and
absolutely -unspotted. The other clutch had a warmer ground

colour, one egg being freely spotted with small brown spots, the
second having one or two brown spots and the third no spots at
all. (I have offered our Editor a photograph of this clutch of
eggs in the nest).
Of course there is no reason why Serins&apos; eggs should be
spotted but, at the same time, I never heard of any eggs of this
family not having spots, and generally the spots are black.
During incubation the male used to sing most charmingly.
The song is more varied and more sustained than that of his near
i-elative, the Grey Singing Finch, and not quite so shrill. I
understand that this little bird (called by the colonists the Black-
throated Singing Finch)has a high reputation in South Africa as
a songster and, personally, I place it first of all the African Serins
I have myself heard, the Grey Singing Finch second and the
Grey-necked Serin — the so-called &amp;quot;Cape Canary&amp;quot; — third.
I was prevented from ascertaining the exact period of in-
cubation owing to a temporary absence from home, but the nest
contained two young on the 21st. The young look very like
young Canaries in the nest, having the characteristic type of
down on the head, but they have a very dark skin.
Although the young had the advantage of a warm aviary
and fairly even temperature, and were carefully fed by the
parents, they lived only a few days.
In the meantime another pair, in the outdoor aviary, had
constructed a nest in a nest - box hanging on a wall, and
commenced to sit at the same time. This pair certainly
laboured under many disadvantages. They had to endure all the
rigours of an exceptionally severe winter, ten degrees of frost
being several times registered at night, and the hen was not only
very badly feathered but had to endure the most bitter persecu-
tion from the two hens who Were not nesting.
However, it is always the unexpected that happens in
aviary matters, and this pair succeeded where the others failed.
The explanation is, I think, a simple one, namely that they
could obtain insect food, whereas the pair in the covered aviary
could not. For this reason, I always wonder how any results at
all are obtained in indoor aviaries, and needless to say sugh_
results, when obtained, are exceedingly creditable.

Insect food being so scanty in February the parents had to
fall back on midges, which they spent hours in catching.
Of the two young hatched one was killed, when about a
week old, by another hen : the other is alive and well as I write
(April ioth) and quite independent. The young in nest plumage
have the yellow rump quite as distinctly marked as the adults.
The pencillings on the breast are darker and more numerous
than in the case of the adults, but on a lighter ground. The
call-note of the young is ch&apos;e-ch&apos;e.
I have not been able to ascertain as yet whether the
Yellow- rumped Serin has been bred in this country or not.
Although such a hardy species and common enough in its own
country, not very many seem to have been yet imported.
Our Zoological Gardens had quite a small colony of these
Serins, in an outdoor enclosure near the Ostrich sheds, last
summer, which I watched with much interest. Several nests
were built about the same time, and the young did well up to a
certain age but, some very wet weather coming on, they all
perished. Later in the year I was sorry to hear that the adults
had nearly all been killed by rats.
A VISIT TO MESSRS. PAYNE &amp; WALLACE
AT BATH.
By Rev. Hubert D. Astley, M.A.
It was with great pleasure and satisfaction that I spent two
hours at the Little Zoo on Lyncombe Hill, and I chose a pro-
pitious day, for Mr. Wallace had only just returned from Australia
with the yearly importation of birds that he and Mr. Payne know
so well how to pack and care for. If only all bird-dealers were
to keep their birds as clean and to take an equal pride in them,
one would not have to write upon the &amp;quot; Ruthless importations.&amp;quot;
Mr. Payne apologized to me for the lack of order and cleanliness,
for, as he remarked, Mr. Wallace had only arrived a couple of
days before, and they had little time for putting such a number
of birds into proper order. Nevertheless I have never seen so
many birds in such splendid condition, or so evidently cared
for.

on a Visit to the Little Zoo, Bath. 201
In quite a small room there were two or three thousand
Grassfinches, as well as a great many Parrakeets and Kangaroos,
and yet the atmosphere was perfectly clean and sweet. Scarcely
a bird that did not look healthy, not a seed or waterpan which
was not clean also. And in addition to this, one met with that
which those who are accustomed to it cannot well do without,
extreme courtesy with painstaken kindness and a spirit of hos-
pitality. Would that all English dealers possessed the same
virtues ! It just made all the difference to my visit. And Mr.
Payne is the same in correspondence. Politely - worded and
plainly-written letters by return of post, instead of terse and even
rude post-cards, which more than one so-called &amp;quot;Naturalist&amp;quot; in
England has despatched to me. There are some of these dealers
who before they begin to study the trade of bird-dealing, had
better be sent back to school to learn proper manners, and
humanity with regard to the birds and animals which have the
awful misfortune of being imprisoned in the filthy places they
have ready for them. I am not in the least astonished at Mr.
Porter&apos;s account in the April Magazine of the Ring-necked
Parrakeets. At any rate Messrs. Payne and Wallace treat their
customers courteously and honestly, and their creatures kindly
and humanel}&apos;.
It was a delight to see amongst other birds, such rarities
as a pair of Red-capped (Pileated) Parrakeets, two pairs of Rock
Parrakeets (Neophema petrophila) and a large importation of the
beautiful Earl of Derby or Stanley Parrakeet (Platycercus icterotis)
as well as a quantity of &amp;quot; Twenty-Eight &amp;quot; Parrakeets, and a pair
of the rare Painted Finches (Emblema picta), the little male bird
resplendent with fiery-red patches on face, breast and tail-coverts.
There were also two pairs of the rarely imported Grey Crow-
Shrike : fine grey birds with yellow eyes. They were in a small
box-cage, yet their feet were as clean as if they had been just
caught, and they looked full of vigour and good health.
The numerous Bicheno&apos;s Finches — Gouldian, Iyong-tailed,
Yellow-rumped, etc. might have just been caged from the best
of outdoor aviaries, so spry and sprack did they look.
Mr. Payne showed me the skin of the rare White-quilled—
Rock Dove from Australia, a skin which had once held a living

bird in his possession. The Spotted Emeus were magnificent;
one could hardly believe they had only just been landed after a
long sea-voyage, not to mention the land journey in Australia.
The Kangaroos of various kinds were delightful. So tame and
well kept. And Doves too — Brush Bronze-wings, Bronze-necked
Doves (like very well grown Peaceful Doves) and a big covey of
the little Plumed Doves, sitting closely packed together on the
ground in a very large aviary-cage, and uttering soft cooings*
Mr. Payne tells me these charming little birds are so tame in
their natural state, that they will hardly trouble to move out of
the way of the horses&apos; hoofs as one rides along some track or
primitive road in the Australian bush ; and that their soft coo is
heard on all sides.
On leaving Lyncombe Hill that April morning, I wished
that all the birds and animals could be spared the grief and pain
of finding themselves in places where they would not be cared
for as they are there. I agree that in some shops an inspector of
the R.S.P.C.A. would not be amiss.

In a private letter to the Editor, dated March 12th, 1907,
which he feels sure the writer will not mind his quoting from,
Captain Horsbrugh writes from Potchefstroom, Transvaal, as
follows: — &amp;quot;Since I last wrote you I have got hold of seven or
eight pairs of Harlequin Quail (C. de/egorguei) and it may interest
you to hear that at this time of the year they are extremely
common here and are breeding. The Cape Quail I have not
found here, and all I have shot or handled of other people&apos;s
shooting are delegorguei, while in Bloemfontein it is always
capensis one gets and I never saw delegorguei there. I have
got two pairs of Tumix, but I cannot make out from Stark and
Sclater&apos;s book whether my species is lepurana or hottentotta.
I have got, I believe, an adult male of the rare Vidua
albonotata (the White-winged Whydah) which my brother picked
up in Pretoria, and also Lagonosticta rubricata, which is extremely
like L. brunneiceps, except that it is a very little brighter and
larger by perhaps half an inch.

Breeding Notes of 1900. 203
This place is most interesting from a Natural History
point of view. A few days ago, while fishing in the Mooi River,
I saw the following Herons : Great White Egret, Lesser and Buff-
backed Egrets in hundreds and hundreds, Common Heron,
Purple Heron, and Squacco Heron, the latter is known to the
Dutch farmers as &amp;quot; the little round-backed one,&amp;quot; and if you saw
them sitting you would see how accurately the name fits them.
My brother, Mr. Thomas Ayres, and myself have found that the
Vidua principalis is parasitic on the common St. Helena Wax-
bill which swarms here. Have you ever heard this before ?
I am hoping to get some young Goliath Herons next breed-
ing season — they nest quite close here.
P.S. — I am pretty sure now that my species of Tumix is
lepurana, as hottentotta does not occur N. of the Orange River.
I have not got my last Vol. of the Avicultural Magazine here,
but I think you have already bred this species. Is this not so? &amp;quot;
[No ; so far as we are aware Tumix lepurana has not been
bred in Great Britain, but it has been bred in Germany, as re-
corded in Vol. III. page 217 of our New Series. — Ed.]
BREEDING NOTES OF 1906.
By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S.
Though rather late, I should be glad to be allowed to
record a few notes upon nesting operations of birds in my
possession last summer. I have already described how my Pine
Grosbeaks successfully reared two young. Another species, as I
believe, not previously bred in England, the American Widgeon,
reared four young with me — two ducks and one drake. This
species has I think been seldom imported into Europe, and I
only know of those at Woburn Abbey besides mine which are
living in this country at the present time. The young were
reared easily, their lighter colour when in down enables them
to be easily distinguished from ducklings of the common species
(A. penelope). The young drake has the white shoulder stained
with reddish-grey as in A. penelope of the first year.

cholmleyi), Painted Quail, beside those species referred to already
were reared ; and the following species laid eggs, but for various
reasons failed to rear young (in the case of the Great Bustard and
Tinamou there were no male birds) — Snowy Owl, Great Bustard,
Rufous Tinamou, Grey Hen, Red Grouse, Blue Thrush ; and of
Sandgrouse P. alchatus, P. senegallus, P. exustus. A hybrid
Wagtail was also reared between the Grey Wagtail {Meleyiope) and
the Blue-headed Wagtail, the latter being the female bird. The
nest was placed amongst some loose bricks upon the ground and
only one egg was fertile though several were laid.
My old pair of Blue Thrushes have so often nested and
had clear eggs that not much notice was taken of their first
clutch : but young were hatched, and either immediately were
deserted, or they were starved for want of sufficient insect food.
When the hen laid the second time, we made careful preparation
as regards a supply of mealworms, etc. But for some unaccount-
able reason (for she was never disturbed) the bird threw out her
eggs after they were chipped. Some life was noticed in one, as
it lay on the ground, and half-hatched as it was, it was placed in
a Spotted Flycatcher&apos;s nest, and the latter&apos;s own eggs removed.
The foster-mother reared the young bird for a week when the
nest was pulled down, probably by a cat.
Two partly-incubated common goose eggs were placed
under the Great Bustard, instead of her own unfertile ones. One
proved clear or addled, but the other one was on the point of
hatching, and I was looking forward to at last seeing a Bustard
in captivity rearing something (in 1902 another female Great
Bustard now dead did hatch a young bird, as I have already
recorded). But she appeared quite upset by the &amp;quot;cheeping&amp;quot; of
the gosling, and leaving the egg she strode about her enclosure
in a state of great excitement for an hour or more. However I
watched her back to the &amp;quot;scrape&amp;quot; in which lay the egg, and at
dusk she seemed to settle down upon it. But the next morning,
to my great disappointment, the poor young gosling was dead,
having seemingly been roughly pulled out of the shell and after-
wards maltreated by the excited foster-mother.

GARDENS.
After considerable delay, caused by difficulties arising
under the London Building Acts, this house has at length been
completed, the greater part of the cost being defrayed by the
generosity of Mr. C. Czarnikow, F.Z.S. The building is con-
structed of fire-proof material known as &amp;quot;Uralite,&amp;quot; and is heated
and ventilated by the new &amp;quot; Laugfield &amp;quot; system. On the two
longer sides there are large flight cages, while tiers of smaller
cages are erected against the end walls and in the centre of the
building, and there are some outside flight cages on the south
side. Already the house is fairly well stocked: Troupials, Bul-
buls, Mynahs, Thrushes, Grosbeaks, Buntings, Grassfinches,
Waxbills, &amp;c. being represented from many parts of the world.
Many aviculturists 011 entering this house will remark that there
are too many cages and too few aviaries, but one thing must be
said for the system of cages, and that is that there can be no
means of mistaking one bird for another as each cage is labelled
with the name of its occupant. At present the outside cages are
occupied by some of the Crows.
By the courtesy of the Zoological Society we are able to
reproduce a photograph of the house by Mr. B. L,. Medland,
which appeared in the recently issued Annual Report of that
Society.

Many of our readers will doubtless have heard of the
exhibition of paintings, modestly described in the official invi-
tation and catalogue of them as &amp;quot;Studies of Bird-Life in Water-
colour by George E. Lodge, &amp;quot; at the Rembrandt Gallery, at No. 5
Vigo Street, Loudon, W. Some of us have already seen them,
but others who are fond of studies of bird life should not miss
the opportunity of paying this little Gallery (with its present
collection of fifty-four subjects) an early visit, as they will not
have the opportunity after the 15th May.
Mr. Lodge has probably followed his own bent in the

matter of choice of subjects, and one may see him at his best,
and also (if I may say so) at his worst. The subjects are chiefly
Birds of Prey and Game Birds with a few studies of Wild Fowl.
In all of them the subject is treated in the opposite way to what
a landscape painter would treat it, i.e. the bird is by far the chief
and, in nianj* cases, the whole consideration ; the landscape
element being often almost entirely eliminated, while the bird
itself is studied with scrupulous care.
Birds of Prey, we believe, are Mr. Lodge&apos;s great favourites,
and whether they are or not, one can see how he regards them,
both by the number of studies of them and by the pains lavished
on their portraits. No. i in the catalogue is of a Peregrine&apos;s
eyrie, with three young birds, nearly fledged, but still with down
on their heads and bodies, and their wing and tail feathers short.
They have wandered a little from the nest, if such it can be
•called, and are apparently awaiting the return of one or other
parent with a freshly killed Plover, Grouse or Teal. At a little
distance one of the birds seems to disappear, and the others might
almost be growing out of the rock, so well does the immature
plumage harmonise with the surroundings of their bleak moun-
tain home. No. 2 is a covey of Partridges flying over an expanse
of snow, and in this subject Mr. Lodge is much more faithful to
nature than to the traditions or conventionalities of art— there is
much more snow than Partridge. In No. 3 we see a group of
Grouse at rest, and in one of the birds, a male, we especially
notice a departure from the orthodox way of depicting birds,
that is in a complete state of one phase of plumage (a thing
rarely met with in the Red Grouse, which usually shows feathers
of two phases of plumage, when once it has begun to change
from the nestling state). The piece of moorland also is more
the actual than the conventional, and the gnarled stalks of dead
heather in the foreground are nearer reality than the eternally
blooming heather with which we are supplied by other painters.
Neither the birds nor the surroundings are conventional in the
least degree and we should like to see subjects by other painters
treated with the same regard for truth. No. 4 is a pair of Reed
Buntings, depicted as the present writer (and doubtless Mr.
Lodge) saw them in the reeds fringing Wickeu Fen — the only

piece of primaeval fen left to us. As this is purposely a painting,
of a definite place we are given a more elaborate background to
these little birds than to most of the other subjects. Only Reed
Buntings are shown, and both birds perched in their favourite
and characteristic attitudes on growing reeds, with a soft back-
ground to show them up in their modest but pleasing plumage.
No. 5, the largest study of the lot, is of two male Pheasants, and
the nearer one is studied with care and elaboration in which we
may say Mr. Lodge surpasses himself, though it might be said
that the primaries and tail of the nearer bird are overdrawn, as
they are rather hard. In No. 6 the painter is entirely at home
with his subject, for it shows one of his favourite birds, the
Peregrine, contemplating a descent on one or other of a pack of
Grouse which, had they known their enemy was near, would
probably have kept to the protection of the ground, instead of
giving this noble bird a chance of striking them, as it always
does, in the air.
The rather bird&apos;s-eye view of a field with Pheasants in
(No. 7) is faithful to nature and unconventional in composition,
and is Mr. Lodge at the other extreme to what we see in some of
the large Falcon studies, there being much background and little
bird. In his rendering of the minute markings of feathers we
again see Mr. Lodge at his best in No. 8, which is of Partridges ;
we hardly think anyone else would bestow such pains in the
elaboration of feathers. The sense of air given in No. 9 of a
Suffolk Marsh is agreeable, and a naturalist is glad to be able to
contemplate such a scene and still keep his feet dry. A Heron,
Peewits, Mallards and numerous Dunlin are shown in a rather
chilly looking landscape.
Many of the other studies show the same characteristics as
those described above ; the scrupulous care in feather painting,
the open landscape, or perhaps no landscape at all but a sky
instead, and as space forbids me describing all the other works,
I will simply mention those which stand out most in my recol-
lection. No. 12, of Barn Owls, is soft in treatment and warm in
colour. No. 13, a large and very careful study of a Peregrine
taking flight. No. 14, a Kestrel hovering, showing exceptionally
truthful treatment of &amp;quot;values&amp;quot; and good cloud effect. No. 15.,

of a flight of Golden Plover, a little formal. No 17, an old male
Grouse looking as if he sighted beaters and was relieving his
feelings by grumbling at the intrusion. No. 18, &amp;quot; Marsh Harrier —
Hickliug Broad.&amp;quot; Would that we might see Marsh Harriers on
Hickling or any other Broad for that matter, or anywhere else in
Britain, but that treat is for very few of us. This again is a
painting of a particular place, and the landscape part is more
pleasing, to me at any rate, than any other study in the series.
The Harrier is shown beating over the reed-grown surface with
its watchful eyes looking for any luckless Snipe that might be
feeding or vainly trying to conceal itself. No. 19, another large
Falcon subject, surpassing the Peregrine in excellence. The
Peewits, No. 20, should be looked at carefully, if only at the largest
bird, to see how carefully the feathers are painted. Few people
would, I think, care for the cock Partridge calling, (No. 21) but
we doubt not that Mr. I,odge has seen the bird like that. No.
24, of Ptarmigan crouching from a Falcon, shows the remarkable
gift of concealment these birds have. The Kites, No. 25, the
principal bird is fine, but the others look over-coloured for the
distance. The Raven (No. 26) might have had a little more blue
on his sable plumage. No. 27 is, we believe, a study of Iceland
Falcons that has been reproduced in a popular magazine. The
two Pheasant subjects (Nos. 28 and 34) are each rather stiff in
pose and lack the grace a Pheasant often has. No. 29 is a very
original view of a Greenland Falcon flying. No. 30 is of a
Buzzard just alighting and is an unconventional study. The
next is a painting of Red Deer, the only Mammalian subject in
the room, and is about the sunniest subject there. Of three
studies of Golden Eagles, two are soaring and are as good as the
Falcons, but the one perching — an immature bird — is rather hard
and a little dull in colouring. A second study of an adult Pere-
grine (No. 37) like the first (No. 23) is rather heavy in its spotting
and colouring. The Blackcock subject, like some of the Grouse
shown flying look rather stiff, as if &amp;quot; set,&amp;quot; perhaps through
detail being shown which can really only be seen in a bird that
is still.
The last fifteen subjects are of less importance than the
first ones and rather suffer by comparison. The Teal and Snipe

subjects and some others might have been more brightly coloured,
and the Bewick&apos;s Swans (No. 42) less heavy in shadow, though
this may be truthful enough. I should like to have seen a
far larger space allotted to the Osprey (No. 52) considering what
some of the others have got, and a few of the subjects, such as
the Ptarmigan (No. 46) and the Mallards (No. 53) I would
willingly sacrifice in an exhibition which shows us so many good
things. Herbert Goodchild.
THE BREEDING OF LORIKEETS IN CAPTIVITY.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The published records of the successful rearing of young
hy Lorikeets in captivity in the United Kingdom are few and far
between, though doubtless instances have occurred that have not
been brought to light. So far Swainsou&apos;s Iyorikeet (Trichoglossus
novae- hollandics) seems to have been bred successfully several
times, some twenty-five or thirty years ago, from the letters of
correspondents of the Bazaar, published in the first series of
Notes oil Cage Birds (1882). One writer appears himself to have
reared two nests in a season and writes (p. 87) : &amp;quot; I have before
me the names of four amateurs who have successfully bred this
parrot.&amp;quot; Another writer remarks (p. 88) : &amp;quot; I am acquainted with
two gentlemen who have frequently bred the Pennant, the Pale-
headed Parrakeet, Rosellas, and the Bine Mountain Lory.&amp;quot;
In the Second Series of Notes on Cage Birds another writer
records the successful breeding of a pair of these birds in the
Blackpool Aquarium, and Mr. Osbaldeston gave a more detailed
account of this interesting event in the Avicultural Magazine
(Vol. VIII., p. 167) where he tells us that this pair bred &amp;quot; year
after year for some four years previous to 1890.&amp;quot; One year, we
are told, &amp;quot; a very curious, handsome, &apos;sportively&apos; plumaged bird
was reared.&amp;quot;
It is with great pleasure that I am able to record
yet another instance of Trichoglossus ?iovae-holla?idus breeding
successfully in captivity in this country. A pair of these birds,
belonging to Miss Rosa little, at Twickenham, are kept i^ua-

large box-shaped cage in a conservatory. The cage is 3 feet 6
inches wide and 1 foot 10 inches in depth, and the height is
equal to the width. In January 1906 two eggs were laid in a
corner on the floor of the cage but with no result. On January
13th, 1907, an egg was laid in the same place, and a second fol-
lowed about ten days later. The eggs were placed in a shallow
wooden tray, about one inch deep, filled with sawdust, and the
birds appear to have generally sat together on the eggs. Incu-
bation commenced about a week after the first egg was laid, and
one young bird was hatched on the 12th of February, the second
egg being also fertile. At first it was covered with white down.
The bill was black.
Being unaware that there was anything very remarkable in
the breeding of this species in captivity Miss Little did not keep
any notes on the subject, so I am unable to give any details re-
garding the assumption of the plumage. But when I saw the
young bird on April 25th it was ten weeks old and its plumage
was similar and in every respect to that of its parents except that
it was not nearly so brilliant. The bill was just changing from
black to yellow. It could fly and feed itself, though the parents
also fed it.
The cage in which these birds live is kept at the side of a
passage in the conservatory, and is constantly being passed at all
times of the day. Nesting boxes and logs were supplied, but the
birds would have none of them, but preferred the floor of their
cage, surely a remarkable preference for birds of such arboreal
habit as the Trichoglossil The birds are fed on bread and milk,
fruit and seed, and no extra food has been supplied during the
rearing of this young bird.
This case is, I think, a very interesting one, and onl5 r
shows how ready some birds are to adapt themselves to circum-
stances. I am indebted to my friend Mr. Edward Bidwell for
bringing this case to my notice, and to Miss Little for her kind-
ness in allowing me to see her birds and for explaining every-
thing to me.
The other species that have bred in this country may be
here enumerated. Apparently they are but three in number : —

An instance of the successful breeding of this species is recorded
in Notes on Cage Birds (Second Series, p. 170), above the initials
&amp;quot;H.J.&amp;quot; The young were reared in mid-winter in an outdoor
aviary. The hen commenced to sit on December 21st and the
young birds (two) left the nest, a large cocoa-nut husk, on Feb-
ruary 26th and March 4th respectively. The year is not given.
These are the only records that I can find of Lorikeets breeding
in this country, but very possibly there are others, and if ain&apos;
member or reader knows of such I would express the hope
that they may be published in this journal.

CATCHING SULPHUR-CRESTED COCKATOOS.

[The following article appeared in The Field of March 16th last and
is here reproduced by the courtesy of the Editor of that journal.]
In Australia the Sulphur- crested Cockatoo (Cacatua
galeritd) is the commonest of domesticated wild birds, not even
excepting the Rosella Parrot. Fortunately this lovely and
distinctive bird is holding its own well, and shows little or no
signs of decreasing in numbers. Not long ago I saw a trailing
flock of Cockatoos, about half a mile long and containing some
thousands of birds, pass over my house in the western district of
Victoria. All over Victoria it is the same ; in fact they are so
numerous in some of the wheat - growing districts as to be a
serious pest.
This kind of Cockatoo is gregarious for the greater part of
the year and usually goes about in great flocks ; but towards the
end of July these flocks break up, and in August one may see
the birds in pairs flitting from tree to tree in search of a nesting-
place. They nest iii the hollow stems and branches of the huge
eucalyptus trees that are so common over most of the state of
Victoria. These great gaunt trees tower up to a height of iooftr^

or more, and their boles are bulky, smooth, and usually branch-
less for the first thirty or forty feet. The living trees are often
hollow or have a hollow broken limb, while the dead trees are
usually hollow nearly all over. The Cockatoo is not particular
whether the hollow is in a live or a dead tree, so long as the tree
is big and unclimbable in the ordinary way and is not too near a
house. The more inaccessible the hollow is the better the bird
likes it, as I have found to my cost when in search of a nest.
This is a very simple affair, and is usually placed some four or
five feet from the outlet — just too far away for one to reach it
with the hand. There the Cockatoo lays usually two, sometimes
one, but occasionally three large white eggs.
It is at this time that the Cockatoo hunter looks for the
nests. The birds, however, are very shy and cunning. They
will never go into the nest while anyone is about, and, if one
is approaching a clump of trees containing nests, an old cock-
bird standing sentinel on the top of the tallest tree will give the
alarm call, and instantly every hen-bird will slip out of the nest-
ing holes, without a sound, before one is close enough to locate
them. Where there are solitary nests a plan to find them, which
is often practised, is to ride around with a stock whip, and crack
it beneath a likely tree. The report of the whip — which, in the
hands of a practised man, is like the noise of a pistol — sends the
hen-bird off her nest at once. A method I often followed was to
go just at sundown and sit where I would not be noticed, keep-
ing a careful eye on all the likely holes. Kven then, unless I
watched very sharply, the first thing seen would be the hen-bird
flying silently and swiftly away, some \&apos;ards from any tree.
When the young are hatched a nest may often be found, if
it is in a dead tree, by tapping the bole and then placing one&apos;s
ear against it. If the youngsters are alone they will at once
begin a clamour for food, which can be distinctly heard. The
parents feed the young early in the morning and just before
dark, and I have often found nests by watching the old ones at
work. But one must be concealed to do this, for once the Cock-
atoo sees you the alarm is given, and no further feeding is done
in that neighbourhood until you disappear.
When you have found your nests, the next question is

how to get at them. A ladder is of no use, for it would be
impracticable to take one that was long enough without a great
deal of trouble. I have got at many nests by using a long rope.
The rope was cast over the first limb and a loop made in one end,
in which I stood, while a mate hauled me up. Once on the first
limb, with the help of a hatchet I could often reach the next.
Sometimes I had a second rope and threw it over a higher limb,
pulling myself up with it. Soon, however, I discovered a better
method. This was to provide myself with a number of steel
spikes and a tomahawk. I drove the spikes into the bole of the
tree a good distance apart and used the spikes as a ladder,
driving them in one above the other, as I mounted. By this
means the tallest of trees could be ascended in a very short time.
Of course, care had to be taken to drive the spikes in sufficiently
to support my weight, and yet not to drive them in too far, since
they had to come out again. There is, of course, an element of
danger in climbing after the nests by either method, and I always
had a mate, in case of an accident happening.
Upon reaching the nest, the tomahawk was brought into
further use, in the way of chopping a hole into the nest. As I
have mentioned, the latter is usually too far down for the birds
to be reached with the hand. Some nest hunters use a wire with
which to pull the young birds up, but this is likely to injure them.
Sometimes, when the bole has been too thick to be conveniently
■cut through, I have put a small stick down and have waited until
the young one grabbed it with his curved beak. Then I have
pulled him up far enough to catch him with 1113^ hand. But the
usual method is patiently to cut away at the limb or bole until
■one can get at the young birds direct.
The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is a bird of very slow de-
velopment, which probably accounts for its longevity. I have
known eggs to be in the nest early in August, and then have seen
the young birds still in the nest in December. My plan was
always to let the parent birds do most of the rearing, and to take
the young ones just as they were ready to leave the nest. They
are then fully feathered, and can only be told from the old birds
by their smaller size and their softer and paler bill. A seCond__
reason for a young Cockatoo remaining longer in its nest than

most birds is that, if it once fell out of the nest it would have no
chance of getting back. A young Magpie and Crow, for example,
can try little flights from the nest amongst the slender branches
in which it is always built. But the young Cockatoo finds nothing
between the edge of his nest and the cold ground. So he waits
until his wings are well grown, and even then he sits on the edge
of the nest a long while ; and it takes a lot of coaxing from his
parents to make him fly. At last, when he does fly, he goes
straight off to a neighbouring tree. I usually put the young birds
inside my shirt front and brought them down with me; but
sometimes I have thrown them gently into the air and let them
flutter to the ground. One has to be very careful, however, to
see they are not too well feathered. Once I tossed a young one
into the air, and it flew straight off. It had got such a fright
that it never thought of alighting on a neighbouring tree, but
continued flying as long as my astonished eyes could follow it.
In descending the tree one has to be pretty careful. As I come
down I have to knock out the spikes and let them fall to the
ground ; and occasionally, in bearing too heavily on a spike while
knocking out another, I have felt it beginning to give way. But,
with care, there need be no accident. In leaving the birds in the
nests as long as possible, there is always a danger of losing some.
I have been exasperated sometimes when halfway up a tree, to
see the young birds first appear on the edge of the hole — alarmed
by the hammer — and then, as I got closer, finally spring into the
air in a first trial of their wings and fly off. About the end of
November the young ones are nearly all flying, and all over the
Cockatoo country you can see little groups of three and four
birds, parents and young, perched in the leafy top of a tall
eucalyptus, or feeding on the seeds of dry wild grass, or rooting
up the wild geranium. By January the last laggards have left
their nests, and towards the end of the month the birds begin to
muster into flocks again. Then you will see huge flocks of snow-
white Cockatoos circling overhead, and you will hear them also,
for their screams are deafening. One of the prettiest sights is a
flight of Cockatoos alighting on a newly-ploughed field. They
make such elegant and continuous evolutions before they come
down that even the fanner whose seed oats they are after cannot
help admiring them.

The Acclimatization of Foreign Doves. 215
There is often a great difference between the talking ability
of Cockatoos, even out of the same nest, but the bulk of them
can talk fairly well. Occasionally, however, one finds a bird with
an almost human articulation, and with an accent that almost
convinces that he understands the language. There are, of
course, many phrases that a good Cockatoo knows the meaning
of, just like a spaniel, phrases relating to food, scratching the
poll, and so on. I heard a Cockatoo the other day say &amp;quot; One,
two, three, four, five, six, eight, d it, I&apos;ve forgotten the seven
again,&amp;quot; with inimitable expression, and followed by a rollicking
laugh that was really human. Very clever birds like this have,
to their owners, a value above money, and cannot be bought.
For besides its talking qualities, the Cockatoo, when well treated,
becomes very affectionate, and it is wonderful what ill-usage it
will stand without becoming vicious. F. R.

Most of the members of the Avicultural Society are well
aware, from notices that have already appeared in this Journal,
that it is proposed to liberate a number of foreign Doves in the
London Zoological Gardens. Several members have been good
enough to contribute to, a fund for purchasing the birds, while
others have given birds, and in all some forty specimens consisting
of Crested (Ocyphaps lophotes), Brouzewing (Phaps chalcoptera),
Half-collared (Turtur semitorqualtis), Senegal [T. senegalensis) and
Necklaced {T. tigrinus) have been obtained. About the time that
this is in the hands of the members the door of the aviary in
which the birds are now housed will be opened, and the first
batch allowed their liberty, the remainder being let out at in-
tervals of about a week. Very great care will be taken that
they are in no way scared. Their morning feed will be thrown
on the ground in the door way, and the door thrown open.
Every bird has a ring on one leg with the initials D. A. F. (Dove

for supposing that it will do well and become established in
Regent&apos;s Park. It is a beautiful species, grey in colour, with an
upstanding crest and a long tail which it is in the habit of throw-
ing up over its back on alighting on a branch. The primary and
secondary wing-coverts are conspicuously ornamented with iride-
scent colours such as blue, green, and bronze. It is a hardy bird,
of rapid flight and well able to take care of itself. Twenty-one
specimens of this species have been obtained.
The Australian Brouzewing Pigeon (see illustration) is a
larger bird than the Crested Dove and an extremely handsome
species, the wing-coverts glistening in the sun like so many
emeralds and rubies. Ten specimens of this fine bird are
amongst the birds obtained for this experiment. The remaining
birds comprise three species of Turtle Doves, which call for no
special remark.
The birds have been housed and fed by and at the expense
of the Zoological Society of London, to whom those who have
organized this experiment are much indebted. D.S-S.
STRAY NOTES.
Writing from Hyeres on March 26th last, Mr. St. Qnintin sends some
interesting notes on the early migrants. He writes : — &amp;quot; As regards migrants,
I heard the Wryneck on March 13th at Mentone, and many times after-
wards, and saw and identified the House Martin on March 18th, and Chimney
Swallows, also at Mentone, on the 24th and 25th. This place, Hyeres, is a
great landing place for birds, but they are harrassed terribly by the pot-
hunters for restaurants. Spotted Crakes are killed in large numbers. The
likely^ places in the saltmarshes near here are jealously preserved, and the
authorized person seems to work the area at his disposal several times a
da)&apos;, with pointers generally, but with nondescript curs also. I saw a man
one day fire both barrels at a White Stork which sailed in over his head,
evidently fatigued. It seemed quite close to him, but I was glad to see it
settle in the marsh about 300 yards behind him and arrange its feathers.
So it was evidently not really hurt. As far as I can make out all shooting
comes to an end the last week in April.&amp;quot;
We recently had an enjoyable motor-cycle ride to Bath, to see the
newly-arrived collection of Australian birds at &amp;quot; Thel,ittle Zoo. ; &amp;quot; but as Mr.
Astley has written an account of this interesting place we will say no more

than that we thoroughlyendor.se what he saj&apos;S about the excellent condition
of the birds and Marsupials and the care that is taken with them. On our
way home we passed through Melksham, and as the name of that town is
to the majority of aviculturists inseparably associated with that of Mr. C. P.
Arthur, we felt that we could not pass on before calling upon him and if
possible seeing his birds.
Mr. Arthur has a most interesting collection, which he very kindly
took a lot of trouble in showing and explaining. He has a good range of
aviaries well adapted for breeding Parrakeets, and in these he has probably
bred more Budgerigars than anyone else in this country. At the present
time there are only a few of these little Parrakeets, and what there are are
mostly Yellows, but we noticed quite a number of the larger species such as
Pennants, Adelaides, Yellow-rump, Rosellas, and Redrumps. A well built
and well arranged bird-house contained a most interesting collection.
Scarlet Tanagers in some numbers, and not one looking in the least bit out
of sorts. A variety of other Tanagers such as Superb, Tricolour, and Arch-
bishop; a fine Blue Magpie (Urocissa), a Hunting Cissa, Aracaris, several
Parrots and others formed a collection that any aviculturist might well be
proud of.
Mr. Arthur told us an interesting story of a pair of pure lutino
Budgerigars which some of our members will doubtless remember on the
show-bench years ago. They were pure yellow without any stripes, pink
e} r es and pure white cheek spots ; altogether different birds to the Yellow
Budgerigars which are becoming so common now-a-days. And this was-
their history. On examining a nest-box Mr. Arthur noticed three very
dirt)&apos; eggs, and decided to wash them. He therefore took them out and
asked Mrs. Arthur to bring some warm water. The water was brought, but
instead of being only warm it was nearly boiling. Being under the im-
pression however that the water was only warm, two of the eggs were put
into it, but immediately realising his mistake the eggs were hastily snatched
out with a spoon. The third egg was then washed in warm water and the
three eggs were put back in the nest, two being considered by Mr. Arthur
to be most probably quite spoiled by the mistake he had made. However,
as time went on three eggs hatched, and when the birds grew up and left
the nest 011I3&apos; one was an ordinary green bird while the other two were the
unique yellow specimens above mentioned. We advised Mr. Arthur to try
this experiment again, but he said he had often done so, but the result was
boiled eggs.
Mr. J. H. Gurney contributes his annual &amp;quot; Ornithological Report for

of Pallas&apos;s Sand Grouse appear to have visited the east coast in June,
eighteen years since the last great migration. A very exceptional number
of Red-crested Pochards arrived at the beginning of September, possibly
due to the great heat which obtained at that time. Several Ferruginous
Ducks made their appearance, a Crane, a Pelican, a Great Reed Warbler,
Red-breasted Flycatchers, and other rarieties visted the Norfolk coast
during the year.

BRITISH WARBLERS*

Books on British birds are common enough, but books
such as that of which Mr. Howard has just produced the first
part are rare and exceedingly valuable to those who would study
the life history of the birds of which it treats.
The Warblers are an insignificant group of birds of
skulking habits and very difficult to observe, but as a result of
years of patient and careful study and minute observation,
Mr. Howard has been able to tell us more of their habits and
economy than anyone else has ever attempted to do.
From the prospectus we learn that the work is to be
completed in eight parts, in which twenty-three species will be
dealt with. Some forty coloured plates, reproduced by Messrs.
Greve of Berlin who were responsible for the beautiful illustrations
in Lord Lilford&apos;s &amp;quot;Coloured Figures of Birds of the British
Islands,&amp;quot; are promised, as well as about sixty photogravures,
maps, &amp;c.
The price is 21/- per part, but it appears that subscribers
can have the complete work of eight parts for seven guineas if
paid in advance, and at this price &amp;quot; British Warblers &amp;quot; cannot be
called an expensive book considering its high quality.
Part I. is now published and deals in an exhaustive
maimer with the Sedge Warbler and Grasshopper Warbler.
As a frontispiece there is a beautifully executed coloured
plate of eggs illustrating those of the Aquatic, Sedge, Reed,

clironio-lithographic plates of the Sedge and Grasshopper
Warbler, and no less than nine photogravures illustrating the
various attitudes assumed in courtship and so forth, and we can
only say that it is difficult to imagine more beautiful illustrations,
and would most heartily congratulate the artist, Mr. Grouvold,
and the author who, we understand, made the original sketches
from life. Two maps showing the summer and winter distri-
bution of the Grasshopper and Savi&apos;s Warbler complete the
illustrations.
In the text the author describes minutely the plumage of
adults and young, their geographical distribution and life-
history, and those chapters especially which deal with the
latter subject are stories of the utmost interest and fascination
to the nature lover. The nesting habits, courtship and display
of the males are minutely dealt with and the attitudes assumed
by the males are strikingly illustrated in the plates.
If the subsequent parts are equal to the first, and there
is no reason to doubt that they will be, &amp;quot;British Warblers&amp;quot;
will be one of the most charming works that has been produced
on any group of birds.
We hope to notice the subsequent parts in due course.

In this paper the author describes the first fruits of a
series of experiments he has been carrying on during the last
few years in crossing various species of Ducks, the five species
concerned being the Mallard, Spotbill, New Zealand Duck,
Meller&apos;s Duck and Pintail. In these experiments the author has
purposely avoided the question of the Mandelian Laws of
heredity, nor has he made any attempt to prophesy as to the
result of any particular cross, the object of the experiments
being chiefly to try and effect many crosses and, by carefully
watching the results, to attempt to &amp;quot;throw some light on some
of the great and fundamental problems that underlie and per-
meate every branch of the science of Zoology, such as variation,
heredity, reversion, and so forth.&amp;quot;

The result of the experiments proves that hybrids between
any of the five species experimented with are perfectly fertile,
though one, the Pintail, belongs to a different genus to the
others. In fact so successful has Mr. Bonhote been that he has
produced a bird which contained the blood of the five species in
the one individual.
In dealing with crosses of more than two species it became
necessary to invent new terms to denote these, and so the terms
di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, etc. with the suffix -gen were adopted
and will doubtless be followed by those who follow Mr. Bonhote
in experimenting in the hybridization of species.
The actual crosses obtained are accurately described and
several are illustrated in colours, and it is interesting to note that
some of the results resemble species quite distinct from either of
the parents.
The experiments have been carried out in a very thorough
and scientific manner and tend to prove that there is much useful
work to be done in this direction. It is a curious and at present
unexplained fact that in some groups of animals hybrids between
the various species are perfectly fertile while in others they are
entirely sterile. Crosses between the various species of Bovidce
have long ago been shown to be fertile while in the Equidce they
are sterile. Mr. Bonhote has now shown us that the Anatidcz
produce fertile hybrids, while we know that such apparently
closely related genera as Card?telis and Serinus produce hybrids
that are sterile. Why this should be remains a mystery.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997898025" page_id="33229221"  page_num="221" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I am as mucli impressed by it as ever Mr. Astley can be, but
what can we aviarists do ? Personally I would never buy a bird again if the
wholesale destruction of the Japanese Robin and other foreign birds would
thereby be prevented. If he, or any other member could suggest a means,
all of us would only be too glad to combine to fight in the cause of those
innocent and beautiful creatures we love so well. The few, the very few,
out of that one consignment of 6,000 Japs which fell into the hands of the
true bird lover, may lead happy enough lives, but what becomes of the rest
is a mystery to me : even at a shilling or niuepence each, who buys them ?
If they do not perish from the crowding, dirt, and foetid atmosphere of
the dealers&apos; shops, they must quickly succumb to the regimen and treat-
ment accorded to the ordiuar}&apos; Canary by the tyro in bird-keeping.
I am glad the so-called Virginian Nightingale is 32/6, on account of
its protection, instead of the 15/- it used to be ; and so doubtless are other
members, though it will debar me from replacing the old friend I have lost
after seventeen years. And the dear Blue Robins, too ; one can almost be
glad one never sees them advertised now, so excellent is the cause !
As for &amp;quot; the slaughter of birds for women&apos;s hats,&amp;quot; — that case is quite
hopeless, and all one can do is to bear it as best one can, for since fashion
so decrees, feathers women will have, though they had to see the birds-
butchered before their eyes. No matter the example and wishes of our
Queen ; no matter the pleading of the merciful ; the pitiful stories of the
poor Egrets and their offspring in the breeding season, have them they
will. If babies&apos; scalps were to be le dernier cri, after the fashion the North
American Indian, we used to read about, wore those of his enemies in battle,
it would be all the same, safe to say. I wish Mr. Astley would &amp;quot; snatch off
any woman&apos;s hat which nourishes Bird-of- Paradise plumes etc., and leave
the wearer to go home bare-headed,&amp;quot; though I am afraid he would come off
second-best when the hour of reckoning came, before the Justice of the
Peace, especially if the lady happened to be young and pretty. Now, un-
fortunately these huge plumes are worn other than in hats, — in the hair
itself, as I learned to my cost when I found myself sitting behind one the
other night in the stalls of a theatre ; little else could be seen than these
waving dazzling filaments of the Paradise plume, but what matter bird or
audience if only it is &amp;quot; worn &amp;quot; ; The &amp;quot; biggest bag&amp;quot; I ever saw on one hat
was fifteen heads of the Blossom-headed Parrakeet in a shop-window in
Regent Street. Fifteen! this sounds like exaggeration but it is not, I
counted them many times, I tortured myself by counting them. Fight
poor heads in a ghastly cluster at the top, seven ditto ditto underneath the
brim ! The next most tragic spectacle of the kind to come before my

&amp;quot;THE ORIGIN OF BENGALESE.&amp;quot;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999048567567568" page_id="33229222"  page_num="222" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I was much interested in Capt. Perreau&apos;s notes on this question
in the last number of our Magazine : with respect to his experiments, I
should like to make one or two observations ; because I feel that it is only
by thoroughly thrashing out the subject, that we are likely to arrive at the
truth ; and it is the truth, and not our own notions, which we wish to
prove.
It would appear that, from two of the varieties of Bengalee paired
together, one of the young seemed to be typical of Uroloncha acuticauda;
but it is unfortunate that in the same aviary there were four examples of
U. striata ; because, although Capt. Perreau did not observe any chumming
up between the two forms, it is more than likely that the young bird
was the result of a cross between the two. As I have pointed out, Mr.
Teschemaker&apos;s cross between these two birds produced what looked like
U. acuticauda. I have never heard of such a bird being produced in the
numerous instances in which Bengalees were kept by themselves in an
aviary.
Whenever I have kept Bengalees either with Uroloncha acuticauda or
(J. striata, I have repeatedly noticed that they have struggled and fought,
as evening approached, to go to roost in each others&apos; nests, and in more
than one instance I have seen the rightful owner dispossessed for the night.
If (J. striata should succeed in temporarily taking possession of a Ben-
galee&apos;s nest, evicting the male bird, it is quite possible that he would take a
hand in the production of the coming family ; and, unless one took one&apos;s
meals in full view of the nest, and kept it in sight from dawn to dark
during the whole time in which eggs were being produced, it would not be
possible to be certain that out of four Striated-finches in the aviaiy, not
one had influenced the result of the laying: that Capt. Perreau did later on
notice a flirtation between a Bengalee- and Striated-finch, even though it
came to nought, should have convinced him that his young birds might,
after all, not have been produced by Bengalees only.
It is worthy of note that Capt. Perreau and mj-self are agreed in
thinking it possible that both Striated- and Sharp-tailed-finches may have
been concerned in the production of the Bengalee : it will be remembered
that I suggested U. striata as having originated the veiy similar dark brown
and white form ; after which the introduction of U. acuticauda produced
the fawn and white varieties ; possibly Capt. Perreau may think it was the
other way about. Who shall say ? At any rate, we seem to be agreed that
</bodyText>

the Bengalee exhibits certain features of both species, and I am quite ready
to admit that the tendency to revert to U. acuticauda when either species is
crossed with the Bengalee favours the view that the smaller and generally
weaker fawn (and its white variety) was first produced ; yet if a cross be-
tween a Striated-finch and Bengalee at the present time results in a Sharp-
tailed-finch, how was the dark-brown and white variety ever produced at
all ? A. G. Butter.

Sir, — Why not appoint a small Committee to visit the different bird
shops, and those which the Committee think fit let the names and addresses
of the firms be published in the Magazine as suitable places for purchasing
birds ? I am quite sure the Society could do a lot of good in this respect.
Even if my suggestion could not be adopted, surely the Society could adopt
a &amp;quot;foreign member or agent&amp;quot; as Mr. Porter suggests. I would help in

vSir, — As Mr. E. G. B. Meade - Waldo mentions in the Magazine
Hoopoes certainly are difficult to keep. I bought several of these some
time ago hoping to keep them in my outdoor aviary, but alas, just as they
would fly to the door for mealworms, and were getting so tame that one
almost walked on them, the}&apos; dropped off one by one. They always had a
fresh tray full of mould which they loved to probe over, and on coming
across a worm would run to a secluded spot and with numerous taps
manage to break it up, or, if one was not quick enough to get away, a
tug of war would be the result. Although I tried these birds on ants&apos;&apos;
eggs, raw meat, etc. and some soft food which one of them was supposed to
eat, they would have none of it, and subsisted on mealworms only for about
six months, so they certainly did get through a quantity as they were not
stinted in this their one and only food. C. Casti.e-Si.oane.

Sir, — In my paper on the Moorhens and Coots of India in the April
number referring to the Coot, p. 172, lines 1-2, read : &amp;quot; They dive without
the preliminary jump. I have since discovered that this is not correct.
They do jump. This is not discernable en masse when seen from a distance,
but is quite noticeable, when a single bird is close at hand or viewed
through field glasses. Had I had my field glasses with ine when I made
the notes this error would not have occurred which I feel is now incumbent
on me to rectify. Gordon Dalgijesh.

CHEQUERS AND BARS IN PIGEONS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998250038461538" page_id="33229224"  page_num="224" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I think the Society may rejoice that I misunderstood Prof.
C. O. Whitman&apos;s statement as to chequers preceding bars in Pigeons, since
it induced him to send us so valuable and interesting an essay on this
subject.
The reason for my mistake will be evident when I tell our members
that, in the days in which I did much description, I always tried to dis-
tinguish between bars, bands and belts, in indicating the markings on a
species : — A short narrow stripe I called a bar, a long narrow or moderately
wide stripe (whether or not it crossed a wing) I called a band, but a broad
stripe of colour which crossed a wing, I called a belt.
In like manner, speaking of individual feathers, where a transverse
stripe crosses from one side to the other I call it a band; where it does not
-quite reach the margins of the feather, a bar* possibly I may sometimes
have deviated from this rule, but if so it has been unintentionally.
Now, as Captain Shelley described the young of the Maiden Dove as
having &amp;quot;black bars on the scapulars, wing-coverts and secondaries;&amp;quot; as
moreover adult birds which are similarly marked are frequently described
in the same way,t I naturall}&apos; concluded that scientific workers in
ornithology followed the same unwritten laws which appealed to me ; and
it never occurred to me that a bar occupying the position of the chequer in
another species, would be described as a chequer, and that the band or belt
formed by the modification of the juveual bars would be spoken of as a bar.
Looking, therefore, upon chequers as spots of colour and bars as short
transverse stripes, I uaturall}&apos; concluded that in the African Bronzewing
Doves bars preceded chequers, and I am greatly indebted to Prof. Whitman
for his courteous explanation of his meaning. A. G. Butter.

THE COMMON HANGNEST.
Icterus vulgaris (lemoneus).
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D. etc.
In October 1902 I wrote an article in the Magazine upon
the Brazilian Hangnest {Icterus jamacaii) in which I described
two birds, the first received in 1897 was in bad condition, and did
not live quite a fortnight ; the second, which I then supposed to
be the same species, in 1899 ; the latter, however, is a fine speci-
men of the Common Hangnest, and differs in the yellowish-
white colouring of the median coverts, those of /. jamacaii
being black. .
It is evident that these two species are sold, without dis-
crimination, under the name of &amp;quot; Brazilian Hangnest.&amp;quot; Both, in
their fully adult plumage are more or less deep golden orange
(in what I take to be old birds, inclining to orauge-vermillion in
certain parts of their plumage), the head, throat, breast-plumes,
interscapulum, greater part of wings and tail black; both have
a more or less white belt across the wing, but in I. jamacaii,
owing to the blackish median coverts, it is narrow, whereas in
/. vulgaris it is broad. Both have black bills, with a large patch
of whitish ash at the base of the lower mandible ; both have a
pearl-grey orbital naked patch which extends for some distance
behind the eye and pearl-grey feet, yellowish at the proximal
end of the tarso-metatarsus ; iris transparent bone-yellow ; in
the females the bills are considerably, nearly half an inch,
shorter than in the males, and they are slightly smaller birds.
The Common Hangnest is said to come from the Coast-
region of Colombia and Venezuela and Trinidad, whereas the

zz6 Dr. A. G. Buti.ee,
Brazilian Hanguest comes from S. Eastern Brazil, so that it is
odd that they should be confounded by importers.
Dr. Russ quotes some notes on the habits of this species
made by Dr. Guudlach at Porto Rico ; but they are not only
meagre, but probably apply to /. portoricensis.
Dr. Hartert writing of this species in an article &amp;quot; On the
Birds of the Islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Bonaire&amp;quot; {Ibis 1893,
pp. 297-8) observes that &amp;quot; Peters says that this bird occurs on
Curacao, and is said to be paler than the continental form &amp;quot; this
he does not agree with, his specimens having very bright colours.
Further he observes : &amp;quot;I did not find any nests ; but, as every-
body on Curacao knows, they are totally different from those of
Icterus xanthomas in not having the long tube.* 5
&amp;quot; This is much appreciated as a cage-bird 011 account of
its pure flute-like notes, and is often sent for sale from Venezuela.
&amp;quot;This species is not rare in certain places, such as the
rocky hills covered with brushwood and cactus, both on Aruba
and Curacao, but it is absent from Bonaire, thus indicating its
immigration from the continent. I saw it in the bush on St.
Thomas, where it has already been stated to occur by Ridgway
It may have been introduced into that island ; but, on account
of other affinities between the Omis of St. Thomas and that of
Curacao, this is very questionable.&amp;quot; I have been unable to
obtain any further particulars as to the wild life of this species.
In December 1906 Miss Joan Gladstone sent me her
Hanguest, as it rendered itself objectionable to other birds in
the aviary with it. When this bird first arrived and I compared
it with that which I purchased in 1899, I felt certain that it was
a distinct species, on account of its possession of the following
distinctive characters : —
Bird purchased in 1899.
Stoutish in figure, bright orange and black, tail with all the
feathers entirely black ; median wing-coverts yellowish-white ;
naked orbital patch completely encircling the eye. Song mono-
tonous, consisting of one slurred dissyllabic note repeated loudly
at first, afterwards more softly.
* /. xanthornus is a species with black median coverts as in I.jamacaii.

o)i ilie Common Harignest. 227
Bird presented in 1906.
More slender in figure, bright lemon-yellow and black,
tail with white edging to the outer webs of the outer feathers,
median wing-coverts pure white ; naked orbital patch reduced to
a triangle at back of eye. Song far more frequent, represented
by at least eight phrases with variations, and not preceded by
the &amp;quot;• hookaree, hook-aree&amp;quot; which occasionally precedes that of the
deeper-coloured form.*
It seems probable to me that Mr. Peters&apos; birds, seen at
Curacao, may. have belonged to this form; and, if it could be
proved that the lemon-yellow form were confined to any particu-
lar locality, and its superior song or songs constant, its claim to
subspecific distinction under the name of /. limoneus would be
justified ; but there ^ire yet several points to be borne in mind :
On examining the skins in the British Museum collection,
I found one similarly lemon -coloured male specimen, palpably a
badly maltreated cage-bird, with the tips of its flight-feathers
worn off, and all the outer tail-feathers knocked out : this bird
when perfect probably agreed in all respects with mine. All the
■other examples. were bright orange birds, varying slightly in in-
tensity, the deepest coloured being perhaps old birds : the males
and females in about equal numbers (the short bills indicating
the latter sex at a glance).
Among the deep-coloured birds I found some with the
naked orbital patch as in both types ; also the white edging to
the tail-feathers was sometimes present and even terminal white
spots, proving that these rectrices are variable in Icterus vulgaris ;
so that apart from the lemon-yellow of the body and the purer
white of the median wing-coverts, the differences which I have
indicated above cannot be traced in, the skin.
Of course these American Starlings are equally good
mimics with the Old World birds, from which the longer upper
covert of the tenth primary and their different mode of nesting
distinguish them, but to which all their actions prove close
affinity. It is therefore conceivable that an individual might
learn the song Of some wild bird, living in the vicinity of the
* This initial utterance is characteristic of the Icteridce, occurring iii a modified
form in different genera : thus Agilaus pkoeniceus is said to commence its song with the
prelude — H&apos;wa-ker-ee.

nest in which it was reared ; but it seems hardly probable that it
would learn more than half a dozen songs, or that it would begin
them with an utterly unusual prelude.*
I have reduced the songs of my two birds to words, in
order that the differences may be appreciated :
Orange or Saffron form.
Hobka?&apos;ee, hookaree (2 to 5 or 6 times) — heo, heo, heo, heo, heo,
heo, heo, heo, or hooey, hooey, hooey, hooey, sometimes continued
more softly. Beyond the presence or absence of the initial calls
there is no variation from the dissyllabic whistle.

Lemon form.
1. Or-yer, hurri-er, haw, hee ; chut cha- caw, chutcha-caw, chutcha-
caw, chutcha-caw, chutcha-cazv ; hee.
This is the most frequent song, but the following are also
frequently uttered :
2. Or-heer, or-heer, or-choo-choo ; chao-hee, chao-hee, chao-hee, chao-
hee, chao-hee, chao-hee.
In each of these songs the initial notes are brought out
deliberately, but the repetitions rapidly.

These are all that I have noted ; but it is quite likely that
the songs of this Hanguest are even more variable : its call-note
appears to be Or-heer, or-heer ; more prolonged than the com-
mencement of its first song, but the same as in the second.
Although certain collectors and visitors to Colombia,
Venezuela and the adjacent islands may not have met with the
lemon-yellow form in its wild state, it is certain that it has been
met with, or it could not have been sent home : it has certainly
not assumed its colouring in captivity, inasmuch as dealers do
not long keep these birds, there being a ready sale for them ;
* My old bird sometimes utters perfectly one of the metallic calls of my Blue-
bearded Jay {Cyanocorax cyanopogori).

consequently the purchaser may be tolerably sure that the
Hangnest he secures has been recently imported. Russ says of
/. vzilgaris &amp;quot; With us it is rare in the trade, and even the largest
dealers only import it occasionally.&amp;quot; In the second place, the
tendency of the orange-coloured birds is, to deepen with age,
whether in captivity or freedom : moreover in the genus Icterus
we have species which are constantly of a lemon-yellow colour ;
so that it appears to me probable that the bird so skilfully
figured upon my plate will prove to be a local race of its species,
possibly seen by Peters during some seasonal migration to which
it may be subject : as a mere variety, the utter difference of song
is a great stumbling-block.
If the Ornis of all the West Indian islands to the north of
Colombia and Venezuela had been thoroughly studied, it seems
unlikely that a species of dove commonly imported in the bird
trade from the Island of Tobago, should have been reported as a
native of the Island of Grenada, and regarded as a rarity ; yet
this is what happened in the case of Leptoptila wellsi. It is
even not impossible that the head - quarters of this yellow
Hangnest may be on the same island, and that the two species,
— the dove and the starling, may sometimes be sent home in one
consignment.*
In any case it seems to me that the form illustrated on my
plate has quite as high, if not a higher, claim to be regarded as
subspecifically distinct from I. vulgaris as /. curasoensis has from
I. xanthomus ; in the latter case the paler colouring being the
only character indicated ; for length of bill is merely sexual, un-
less it can be shown that undoubted males of the two forms have
been compared.
Mr. Underwood tells me that one of the larger saffron-
coloured species of Icterus is a common cage-bird in Costa Rica ;
and that, in that country, it becomes paler in captivity : this is
certainly not the case with either I. jamacaii or /. vulgaris when
kept here; indeed, as already stated, the colouring seems to
deepen with age.
* Mr. Gronvold tells me that he has seen three Hang-nests at the Zoological, G-ardens
under the name of I. jamacaii which he believes to belong to the same race of /. vulgari5~sg~~^
my specimen : perhaps they may have come from the same consignment. I have seen one
myself, but it is of the ordinary type.

23© Mr. D. Seth-Smith, -■&gt;
■ Insufficiently nutritious food may perhaps account for
deterioration of colour in the Costa Rican captives : but Hang-
nests brought to this country, from Southern Brazil or the West
Indies, are not cheap enough for their owners to grudge them
good food.
Even could it be shown that the pale type of /. vulgaris
could be produced by feeding the normal type upon a purely
farinaceous diet, it would not account for the total dissimilarity
in the song of the two forms, or for the far more graceful outline
of the lemon-yellow form.
That I have not exaggerated the vast superiority of the
lemon -coloured type in the matter of song, is evident the longer
I keep the bird ; since I constantly hear fresh combinations of
word-like notes: the following, which I heard weeks after I had
recorded the eight preceding songs, struck me as being strikingly
different: &amp;quot; Tyarl, Utile it-lee, tyarl; Tyarl, tittle it-lee, tyarl \
Tyarl, tittle it-lee, tyarl.&amp;quot;
Undoubtedly the most frequent song is that noted as No.
i, then No. 8 and next perhaps No. 2 ; the others are only heard
occasionally, and it may be that fresh songs are improvised :
but in the case of the saffron-yellow type, as already stated,
there is never an}&apos; variation excepting in the presence or absence
of the opening hookaree and the occasional continuance of the
monotonous flute-like whistle in a lower and softer key. Such
an absolute dissimilarity in vocal attainments in a wild animal is
to my mind more important than colour-differences.

<bodyText confidence="0.99487275" page_id="33229236"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
Through the kindness of Lady Sutton and her husband
Mr. Hubert D. Astley, I recently had the pleasure of seeing
the latter&apos;s fine collection of birds at Benham Park, and with his
permission I propose to tell our members something about it.
On entering the hall I was greeted with the song of a
Nightingale, a wonderful songster and beautifully tame bird,
brought home with another equally good specimen from Italy.
The other was not quite in song but equally tame.

In a most conveniently fitted up bird-room was a pair of
Meyer&apos;s Parrots, delightfully tame birds, the male of which
allowed almost any liberty to be taken with him though his mate
was not so trustworthy. A pair of the very rare Rock Grass-
parrakeets, Neophema petrophila, occupied a cage here, from
which they were to be transferred to an outdoor aviary when the
weather was more suitable than during the first few days of May
when my visit was made. Four specimens only, I believe, of
this charming little parrot were brought home by Mr. Wallace in
April, and so far as I am aware no others have ever reached this
country alive. It belongs to the &amp;quot;Elegant&amp;quot; group of Grass^
parrakeets and Mr. Astley pointed out to me its long and sharp
claws, apparently for the purpose of clinging to rocks, and its
long tarsi. It breeds in the crevices of the rocks. A third
specimen was in the outdoor aviary, the fourth, a weakly bird,
having died shortly after its arrival. There are six Stanley, or
Earl of Derby&apos;s Parrakeets in the Benham Park collection, some
in this bird-room and others in the garden aviary. A pair of
Yellow-winged Sugar-birds occupied a cage here and were in
beautiful condition ; but perhaps the rarest bird in the whole
of Mr. Astley&apos;s fine collection was a small Parrot from South
America, which he calls the Violet-bellied Parrot Triclaria
cyanogaster. It is a bright green bird with a large patch of violet-
blue on the abdomen and bright reddish-brown eyes. I have
never before seen or heard of an example of this species in
captivity. Mr. Astley&apos;s specimen is a male, as the female lacks
the violet patch. The species is said to be confined to South-
eastern Brazil.
In the conservatory was a beautiful pair of gear&apos;s Macaws,
tame and gentle as they are rare, but Mr. Astley has already
given us an account of these. A fine Blue Whistling Thrush
{Myiopkoneus temmincki&apos;) occupied a large cage by himself, while
others were tenanted by Port Lincolns (four) Crimson-wings
(four) and a female Pileated Parrakeet (Porphyrocephalus spurius).
One pair of these beautiful parrakeets arrived from Western
Australia in April and were secured by Mr. Astley, the male was
in perfect condition while the hen was somewhat rough in feather.
Both were doing well when by some means they contrived to

232 Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
escape from their cage in the Bird-room. The window unfortu-
nately was open and the male, who was as wild as a hawk, made
good his escape ; every endeavour to entrap him was fruitless
though he stayed about for some time. Eventually he flew right
away, and was shot by a keeper on a neighbouring estate. All
who know anything about Parrakeets know how extremely rare
this species is, and will sincerely sympathise with Mr. Astley in
his cruel misfortune.
A beautiful male specimen of the rare Australian Painted
Finch (E??iblema picta) a species which I imagine fewaviculturists
have seen alive, occupied a cage with some Ringed Finches
(Stictoptera annulosd) and Gouldians. A Hangnest (Iclerus
xanthorrhous) and two Grey Parrots complete the list of birds in
the house, so far as my memory serves me, but I may have for-
gotten some. I ought to have mentioned that a spacious balcony
outside the bird-room, overlooking the Park with its lake, is used
for the birds of the bird-room in the summer. A dove-cot is
hung on the wall above this balcony, and last year a Wagtail
built her nest in this, and shortly afterwards a Cuckoo&apos;s egg was
found in the nest, and the young bird was duly hatched and
reared by the Wagtails. About the time of the laying of this
Cuckoo&apos;s egg a female Cuckoo was discovered to have flown into a
bedroom the window of which is close to the balcony. Evidently
the Cuckoo had watched the Wagtail, and in endeavouring to
discover her nest had flown into a window close to the dove-cot
where however she eventually discovered the nest. This case
seems to me of interest as showing that the Cuckoo watches the
birds it intends to be the foster-parents of its young, in order to
discover their nest.
But to return to the foreign birds at Beuham Park. The
outdoor aviary, of which a photograph is here reproduced, stands
on high ground behind the house, and is a most ornamental and
useful structure. It is divided into three compartments, each with
a large open flight. The most important birds here may be
enumerated as follows : — a pair of Queen Alexandra&apos;s Parrakeets
(Spathoptetus alexaiidrce) the male, probably the only one in
Europe, with very well - developed spatules to the second
primaries ; five Bourke&apos;s Parrakeets (Neophema bozirkei) which

have lived out in this unhealed aviary all the winter, and
looked in very good trim ; one Blue-banded Parrakeet (AT.
venusta) also in fine condition ; a pair of Yellow - mantled
Rosellas {Platycerms splendidus). A fine pair of Red-capped
Parrots (Pio?iopsittacus pileahis) seemed inclined to nest and
were driving the other birds somewhat.
A pair of small Guans were delightfully tame and some-
times follow their owner about the garden. The Mountain Cali-
fornian Quail {Oreortyx . pictus) is a most handsome species and
rarely imported ; a few have, however, reached this country and
Mr. Astley has a nice pair. These are all the birds I made special
note of, but there were numbers of others of less importance.
A number of Pekin Robins were liberated close to this
aviary some weeks ago, and several return daily for food. I was
specially interested in being shown a nest containing two eggs of
this species built in a laurel bush some fifty yards or so from the
aviary, — a perfectly natural nest composed of dead leaves, grass
and roots, and lined with horse-hair and a small piece of sheep&apos;s
wool.
Three kinds of Peafowl roam about the Park, the common
(Pavo cristatus), and its black- winged form (P. nigiipennis),
and a pair of the very handsome Specifer or Burmese Pea-
fowl {P. muticus).
In an enclosure of several acres of feu - like ground,
carpeted, when I was there, with marsh-marigolds and cuckoo-
flowers, where in warm evenings the trill of the Grasshopper-
Warbler is heard and the Sedge- Warbler&apos;s harsh notes appear to
come from every patch of reeds ; in this delightful spot Mr.
Astley keeps his Cranes, a most handsome collection consisting
of six Demoiselles, two white Asiatic, five Australian &amp;quot;Native
Companion,&amp;quot; three Balearic and two European, and with them a
pair of Black Storks. The position would seem to be ideal for a
breeding place for Cranes, but I imagine they would need to be
separated in pairs for breeding. They are a most ornamental
group of birds and Mr. Astley&apos;s collection looked most pic-
turesque.
One part of the lake, a goodly expanse of water, is set apart^
for Waterfowl, which have an island all to themselves, and here

are m any rare and beautiful species. Of Swans I noticed the
Black-necked, Black and Coscoroba, the last a peculiarly goose-
like bird but a true Swan nevertheless, with bright red legs and
bill. All the commoner ornamental ducks were represented, such
as Chiloe Widgeon, Carolina, Mandarin, Chilian Pintail, and so
on ; and some remarkable hybrids between Rosy-billed and
Tufted Ducks.
The Ibis aviary has been built so as to take in part of a
stream as well as growing trees, an excellent arrangement.
Shelter is provided by a thatched shed. Here I noticed Straw-
necked, White and Glossy Ibises.
In a meadow some distance away we came upon the Rheas,
two of which were pure white. One white male had just com-
menced to sit and we did not disturb him.
The newest additions to this fine collection are two
Spotted Emus which have the run of an orchard. They are
quite young birds and even now appear to me to be almost as
large as ordinary Emus. It seems at present doubtful as to
what species these birds, which Messrs. Payne and Wallace
imported, belong, but they are said to grow to a much larger
size than the common Emu ever attains to.
In a letter just received Mr. Astley writes — &amp;quot; My Emus
are too funny. They have wild, games of play with me,
suddenly tumbling down on their sides as if they had been
shot, and then as suddenly leaping up again. These birds
and the Cranes strongly evince their joy of life, and there are
vibrations of laughter in the air when they dance and play.&amp;quot;

THE KAKAPO OR OWL PARROT.
This very rare and remarkable New Zealand Parrot, one
of the most extraordinary and aberrant types of the whole family,
is said, doubtless with truth, to be on the verge of extinction.
The arrival therefore, on May 28th, of a living specimen, at the
Zoological Gardens, the first specimen to be exhibited there
since 1875, is a matter of no small importance and satisfaction.

the Kakapoo, Owl-Parrot or Night-Parrot is entirely nocturnal
in its habits, passing the day in some hole or under thick ferns or
brushwood, issuing forth only after dusk to seek its food. It
appears to be mostly terrestrial, though it may climb small trees
to feed on the fruit or leaves. It is incapable of flight, and its
plumage is mottled green and brown, closely resembling its
mossy surroundings.

Unfortunately most of the interesting native birds of New
Zealand are rapidly becoming extinct before the steady advance
of colonization with its ineviable accompaniment of predaceous
animals such as cats and other vermin, and it cannot be long
before these wonderful survivors of a primative race of Parrots
are entirely wiped off the face of the Earth. Such a state of
things is extremely regrettable, but inevitable. It is greatly to
be hoped that the specimen now at the Gardens, where it has
been deposited by the Hon. Walter Rothschild, may at least
survive for some time. If others could be obtained there would -
seem to be no reason why the species should not breed in
captivity. D. S-S.

Without having experienced it, it is impossible for any
person to realize the charm of the Hoopoe in captivity, as it flits
about one in the aviary like some large butterfly, or trots after
one in the bird room with tiny pattering feet; and we maybe
sure that from time to time it will continue to be included
amongst our occasional pets ; and it is therefore in the hopes of
saving the lives of a few of these birds, not for the purpose of
picking holes in my neighbours&apos; jackets, that I venture to rush
into print on the present occasion.
I have had altogether twelve Hoopoes, a few living for
long periods ; and I eventually came to the conclusion that the
difficulty with the Hoopoe — at any rate here in Loudon, with the
reverse of suitable accommodation — is to keep it warm enough all
through the year. It is nothing to have a Hoopoe for a few
months in summer; but just to keep it for this present enjoy-
ment without a thought for its subsequent welfare is an unworthy
spirit for all true lovers of birds. I,et not those venture to keep
the Hoopoe who are not prepared to attend to its needs.
When quite young, and suddenly and without preparation
loosed into a garden aviary, the comparative cold will quickly
kill it ; and even in what we in this country are pleased to call
&apos;warm weather,&apos; the mere damp or coolness of the ground — and
the young Hoopoe, with occasional flits, is ever on the ground —
seems to strike upwards into the abdomen and produce a severe
form of constipation. This I found, though otherwise fatal, if
dealt with promptly, could be remedied by putting fluid magnesia
into the bread-and-milk*, a convenient medium for administering
it, and one the Hoopoe takes to very readily — but prevention is
better than cure.
A seasoned Hoopoe cannot well have too much liberty
during warm weather ; but, as the cold season advances, it must
be shut into some protected place during the night ; and during
* A Hoopoe will not eat bread-and-milk, nor any food, neatly from a dish, but picks
out a piece and carries it off, rolling it in dust, sand, just as it may chance to be. I found it
best to place the food dishes, small ones, on a large piece of floor-cloth, kept scrupulously
clean. This helped to minimize the evil.— R. P.

winter and spring it must not only be shut up but kept warm.
It is a delicate species and must be treated accordingly.
Another difficulty, mentioned by Mr. Meade- Waldo (p.
193), is to keep the bill of the Hoopoe in good order. I have
never had a case of the bill splitting, and consider that such a
calamity need not, nay, should not, occur. I think it is the
result, perhaps, of too much warmth without due provision being
made for the moistening of the bill, aggravated it may be by the
heated condition of the system from too good living. Any way,
it is preventible, and that without special difficulty or trouble. A
depth of damp sand is sometimes recommended, and this is right
as far as it goes, and may be helpful, or even necessary in some
places. During the winter, when the bird cannot probe in the
garden, plenty of sand or something soft must be supplied ; but
I never myself started a damp prodding-ground in my birdroom.
Presumably the bread-and-milk and other moist and cooling
foods were sufficient, for I never had any bill- split ting. But a
few of my older Hoopoes, only two or three as far as I can
remember, did suffer from their bills getting out of order in
another way. In a dry summer, the ground in the garden
becomes hard ; and the two mandibles of the Hoopoe — it is
always at work prodding away — became separated at the tips,
the one from the other, the closed mandibles did not touch one
another throughout their whole length. The affected birds did
not seem much or any the worse, and the defect, although un-
sightly, did not seem to cause difficulty in picking up food. This
state of the bill was certainly caused by hard ground ; exactly the
same thing happened to the mandibles of one of two Woodcocks
I had many years ago, and I think also to those of a Snipe. An
endeavour should be made, therefore, at all times and in all
seasons, to provide suitable prodding-ground for the Hoopoe. I
once knew of a captive Woodcock whose worms were placed in
a thick bed of damp moss. It is possible that moss, or even
moss litter, might prove of use ; I have never tried either myself.
I gather that Mr. Meade- Waldo has not himself kept this
species, or he would hardly recommend just the food that he
does (p. 193).
First, a word as to ants&apos; eggs, mentioned by him and by
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.993679256410257" page_id="33229246"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
238 Mr. R. Phillipps,-
Mr. Astley (O. S. VI. 47). If these gentlemen mean the fresh
cocoons of the larger species of ant, I can understand the
possibility of a Hoopoe being clever enough to get one down ;
but if by &apos; ants&apos; eggs&apos; we are to understand the ordinary dried
cocoons sold to us in this country, I must confess to being a little
puzzled. Has either gentleman actually seen a Hoopoe pick up
and swallow an ant&apos;s egg ? If either has, of course that settles the
matter ; but if neither has seen the operation, I must express a.
doubt as to the ability of a Hoopoe to &apos; mandibulate&apos; one. The
Hoopoe is not the only difficult subject for which ants&apos; eggs are
recommended that simply could not possibly feed upon them.
Birds that have been fed up to Show-pitch on mealworms
do not usually last well. Mr. Castle-Sloane (p. 223) tells us
what is the end of the Hoopoe that has developed the mealworm
habit — &apos; they dropped off one by one.&apos; Mr. Astley (O. S. VI. 47)
enters more into details. His seven birds in their enviable
quarters must for a time have picked up a quantity of natural
food ; but, as the supply fell off, the reserve stimulants (meal-
worms and raw meat) began to tell. He writes : — &amp;quot; Why they
•died is a mystery to me, for they all collapsed before September
was out, and had in the meanwhile had every privilege : mag-
nificent weather, full exercise, natural food as well as ants&apos; eggs,
mealworms and raw meat when they needed it ; and yet as each
one moulted their skin seemed to be attacked by a sort of scurvy,
and the new feathers dropped out when about half grown and
when still to a great extent in the quill stage. One or two of
them had fits into the bargain, and all seven died.&amp;quot; He had
written previously : — &amp;quot; After a week or so I ventured to open the
door and let them fly loose in the garden, and it was the prettiest
and most uncommon sight to see seven Hoopoes flitting along
the terrace towards me when they spied the tin of mealworms in
my hands.&amp;quot; The temptation to use that &apos;tin of mealworms,&apos; to
encourage one&apos;s dearest pets to fly about us, is almost irresistible,
at least I have sometimes found it so ; how can one disappoint a
tiny mite that settles so trustingly on one&apos;s hand and tries to
force open the closed fist, and to insert its bill between the
fingers, and then looks up so pleadingly into one&apos;s face ? I have
succumbed only too often— and so have the birds, for.it is fatal !

o?i Hoopoes and Cuckoos. 239
When I was a boy in the country, I often kept the Cuckoo.
Some twenty odd years ago, I found a Cuckoo in a London bird-
shop. It was a typical specimen of what the Cuckoo in captivity
Usually is, but which it need not and should not be ; however, old
associations were too strong, and I bought the poor creature.
This bird had the raw meat habit, and would not look at any-
thing else ; and I did not then know how I ought to act. In
the course of time, it fell into much the same state as Mr. Astley&apos;s
Hoopoes. Unquestionably, it seems to me, they died from too
high living, no attempt being made to supply a corrective.
In May, 1898 (O.S. IV. 121), when writing about the Euro-
pean Roller, I pointed out that it did not drink, that in captivity
it ate fruit, etc., and mentioned my Hoopoes, only two of which
out of the twelve drinking water. After referring to raw meat,
mealworms, etc., I went on, — &amp;quot; My experience with the Hoopoe
.... has taught me that the first thing to be done with a Roller
is to get it on to sop — milk-biscuit sop is what I actually provide.
This supplies moisture ; the bird takes to it readily, and seldom
tires of it.&amp;quot; Again, on p. 123, I wrote, — &amp;quot;The Hoopoe, if I mis-
take not, is supposed to be wholly insectivorous ; my birds were
not so. In addition to milk sop, I have it recorded that they
partook of rice pudding, stewed pear, and boiled cabbage ;
that they were very fond of tomatoes and stewed onion ; that
they had been seen eating young shoots of Virginia creeper; and
that they were very fond of cherries (uncooked) and red currants.
They also tried grapes, but had difficulty in &apos;manipulating&apos;
them. I still have a lively remembrance of their eagerness and
excitement when cherries were tossed down, each bird seizing
and rushing off with its prize; using the bill as a gouge, they
scooped the flesh off the sides as cleverly and neatly as if they
had been at it all their lives.&amp;quot; In theory, Mr. Astley&apos;s and Mr.
Castle-Sloane&apos;s system of feeding was wise, and mine foolish,
ridiculous. But their birds died, and mine lived — so far as food
was concerned. Mine never had fits, nor anything wrong with
skin or feathers, —chill, consumption (generally the second or
third year), and accidents disposed of my twelve. The additions
to the &apos;natural&apos; diet which I have mentioned must have tended
to cool their blood ; and the general treatment stopped all

tendency to bill-splitting. The consumption was not caused by
want of nourishment, but by my slowness to realize that the}&apos;
needed so much protection from cold, especially in the spring of
the year, and by my letting them out too much in the cold
weather.
I must be pardoned for pursuing the subject of green food
for supposed purely insectivorous species, when in captivity, a
little further.
How many of you are aware that our Common Cuckoo, at
any rate the real thing, without a feather broken, flying loose in
aviary and birdroom, is very keen after gree7i food ? In olden
days, during the winter, I used to grow green food in gardeners&apos;
&apos; striking &apos; pans ; and I certainly was surprised to find that the
most eager bird to visit these pans was the Cuckoo. Its great
delight was the head of the sprouting pea when an inch or two
above ground, — these were immediately singled out and devoured
by the Cuckoos. In the spring, I planted peas in the garden
especially for them ; and on a warm day when they were let out
there were two special attractions, a ray of sun and the sprouting
peas. Now these Cuckoos were for the most part loose, and free
to feed upon what they liked. But here a caution : — although,
as has frequently been remarked, the bird loose in the aviary can
often eat even frosted green food with impunity, green food
given to the same bird while in a cage may cause its death from
peritonitis.
The adult wild Cuckoo, as a rule, is a difficult bird to
watch, so one must not be too positive ; but I have no recollec-
tion of ever having seen anything that would lead one to suppose
that it eats green food, and I fancy that no one has yet suggested
that it does. Assuming, therefore, that the wild bird does not
touch green food, how are we to account for the aviary bird
taking to it of its own free will ? I suppose that if the bird has
been fairly well kept, and no mealworm or other • drug &apos; habit
set up, some wonderful instinct impels it to devour alien foods
that will correct the evil results of unnatural diet or treatment,
just as the captive dog, cat, and lion takes an occasional dose of
grass.
I remember reading somewhere — and surely there is

something in it — that we all live on green food, I think it was
upon grass, directly or indirectly. We humans devour great
quantities of grass — too much the Vegetarians tell us : then our
regimen is more correct than theirs — through the medium of the
ox and the wether ; that is, these beasts eat the grass and we eat
the beasts, taking the grass at second hand. And so with the wild
lion, etc., who will not touch the carrion-eating hyaena and jackal,
but goes for the grass-eating antelopes and the like, living,
therefore, upon grass, taken through the medium of the antelope.
And so of the Cuckoo. Although it does not go in very much
for grass, yet it consumes great quantities of green food through
the medium of the caterpillar. I will leave it to my readers to
apply the argument to the Hoopoe. Any way — keep your
Hoopoe warm, provide suitable prodding-ground, and beware
of the mealworm.
I think I must narrate the story of my last pair of Hoopoes.
They were very good birds, I understood their wants and ways,
and was hopeful of breeding the species. The female had an
extraordinary craze for boot-laces. The instant I appeared, she
would vigorously attack my boots, and without ceasing would
continue the attacks as I walked or rather endeavoured to walk
about. And when one day the bird-girl trod upon her, and
crushed out her poor little life, sorely grieved though I was I did
not utter a word of reproach. But my leniency was misplaced,
for it only made her careless. The birdroom window opens on
to the garden aviary ; and, when the lower sash is thrown up, the
birds fly backwards and forwards. When it is closed, a movable
wire-netting screen prevents the birds from flying against the
glass, a separate screen protecting the upper sash. Now it is
the very strictest rule that not under any circumstances is the
lower sash, when down, to be left unprotected. The surviving
Hoopoe&apos;s favourite seat was on a thick bough fixed up high
across the room ; and it was his constant habit to take a dive, or
&apos;header,&apos; off this perch down through the window into the aviary.
One da)&apos;, this same bird-girl came to me : — &amp;quot; Please, Sir, Oo-
poop (her name for the Hoopoes) &apos;s a lying on &apos;is back on the
floor, a kicking on &apos;is legs in the air.&amp;quot; I rushed to the birdroom ;
the window was shut, the glass was unprotected, and on the floor

lay the Hoopoe on his back, dead. He had taken his customar}&apos;
header, had struck the glass and broken his neck. It was a case
of deliberate disobedience on the part of the girl, shutting the
window and leaving it thus without the screen. Oh ! the in-
tensity of the auger that burned in my heart. I could have
scragged the wretched creature with the greatest delight.
Suffice it to say that from that day to this I have never kept a
Hoopoe — nor a bird-girl ! ! ! Reginald Phixupps.

The last twelve mouths or so have been spent by Mr.
Walter Goodfellow in a collecting trip in New Guinea and the
surrounding islands, and on the 28th of May he reached home
with quite the most remarkable collection of living birds that has
ever arrived in this country. These birds, which are now in
Mrs. Johnstone&apos;s fine aviaries at Burrswood, Groombridge, consist
of no less than three species of Birds of Paradise, a Great Black
Cockatoo, a Racket-tailed Parrot, rare Lories and Lorikeets.
The Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise {Selucides alba) is an
extremely beautiful species, of which an example, probably the
only one to reach this country alive before the present importa-
tion, was at the London Zoo. in 1881.
The Red Bird of Paradise {Paradisea rubra), of which
there are two examples, is much like the Great Bird {P. apoda),
but if anything more beautiful, and the plumes are red instead of
yellow as in the latter species. Mr. Goodfellow has secured
several pairs of the King Bird of Paradise (Cicinnurus regius) the
female of which has never before been brought alive to England.
In fact these are the first hens of any Paradise Birds to reach,
this country. Mr. Goodfellow has been most successful with
these birds. He managed to get them on to hard-boiled egg very
soon after they were caught, and he tells me this was a most
useful diet for keeping them in condition. This was afterwards
mixed with insectivorous bird-food and the birds gradually be-
came accustomed to this and have done well on it, all being in
wonderfully good plumage and condition.

Arrival of Rare Foreign Birds. 243
The Great Black Cockatoo {Microglossa aterrimus) of which
Mr. Goodfellow has brought home one specimen, is a most ex-
traordinary bird with an enormous bill, well adapted for breaking
hard nuts, upon which it largely subsists in a wild state. The
lower part of the face is bare of feathers and the skin bright red.
The bird is wonderfully tame and gentle and delights in being
petted.
Of the Lories and Lorikeets the space at my disposal will
only permit of the briefest notice being given.
The Black Lory (Chalcopsittacus ater), three specimens, all
in good condition and extraordinarily tame and gentle. Only
one specimen has been previously imported (cf. Vol. III. N.S.
P- H7-)
One specimen of Eos fuscata from New Guinea, extremely
rare, and imported now for the first time.
One specimen of Eos cyanogenys, equally rare, also from
New Guinea.
One pair of Eos semilarvata from Obi, a small island off the
north west of New Guinea. There is no specimen of this in the
British Museum and its habitat was hitherto unknown.
Two pairs of Black-throated Lorikeets (7richogiossus uigri-
gidaris) from the Aru Islands {cf. Vol. IV. N.S. p. 21).
Three specimens of the Greeu-uaped Lorikeet (71 cya?io-
gravwms) from Western New Guinea.
A fine specimen of the Racket-tailed Parrot (Prionoturus
plahirus) of which species a coloured plate appeared in our
Magazine (Vol. I. N.S. p. 345).
There is one other pair of Lorikeets at present unidentified,
which will probably prove to be rare, and one or two species of
Bulbuls and Starlings of which space will not allow me to speak.
I am much indebted to Mrs. Johnstone for allowing me an oppor-
tunity of seeing this unique collection.

ence, and on dull days they mope and look unhappy, however
high the temperature of their abode may be kept. If the tem-
perature drops below a certain degree they become torpid aud
apparently lifeless, but revive when warmed again. Of course in
their new home the temperature will never be allowed to fall
below about 70 Fahrenheit, but on the journey from Southampton
to London it was impossible to keep them warm enough, and on
arrival some were found to be in a torpid state. One appeared to
be dead, but on being placed close to the hot-water pipes it
quickly revived and was soon buzzing about the house like a big
moth.

mostly Tauagers which, so far, are unidentified ; one especially

On the first of May the first batch of Doves, which had
been housed for some time in the Southern Pheasantry of the
Zoological Society&apos;s Gardens, were liberated. The morning feed
was withheld until eleven o&apos;clock, the time appointed for the
liberation. The food was thrown down just outside the door,
aud the birds quickly commenced to descend from the perches
and leisurely walked out. There were in all between thirty and
forty birds, nearly all of which walked out and fed 011 the lawn ;
but immediately they were satisfied they commenced one and
all to return to their aviary. One Half-collared Dove which
happened to fly out of the door seemed too frightened at finding
itself free to settle, and after circling round once or twice took a
bee-line to the north-east and was soon lost to sight. We hardly
expected to see this bird again, but the next day it was perched
on the Western aviary.
After about a dozen birds had returned to the aviary we
thought it advisable to quietly walk up and shut the door so that
some at least should have their freedom. Those that were out
commenced to walk and run over the grass and flower beds, aiicT

several flew up into the trees and some made for the Park. The
Crested Doves began to show us their true wild flight, which can
never be seen in an aviary however large this may be. The
flight of this species is extremely fast. The crest is laid
back and the bird with its long tail presents the appearance
of a Cuckoo except that it flies much faster. It is very fond
of flying up to a height and then swooping and circling
round on outstretched motionless pinions, and alighting on the
perch it has just left ; and on alighting the tail is thrown up over
the back in the manner familiar to those who know the bird in
captivity. Twenty -three birds, consisting of eleven Crested
Doves, four Bronzewings, three Half-collared, four Necklaced
and one Senegal Dove were given their freedom that day. Ten
days later about ten more were let out.
These birds were purchased with money subscribed by a
few members of the Avicultural Society and a few were pre-
sented by members. A balance sheet has been sent to the
subscribers, some of whom have witnessed the liberation of the
birds.
I am glad to say that there are still a number of Crested
Doves, the species best adapted for this experiment, to be liber-
ated, for since the others were let free I have received a donation
from His Grace the Duke of Bedford, who has taken great
interest in the experiment, which has provided for the purchase
of ten pairs of Crested Doves, eight pairs of which have already
been delivered and the others are expected in a few days. Three
pairs of Senegal Doves have also been obtained. These are in
somewhat rough feather, and will be kept in the aviary until
their plumage has improved.
It is of course difficult at this early date to say whether
the experiment is destined to succeed or fail, but there seems
every prospect of the Crested Dove at least becoming established.
One can almost always see five or six of these about in the
Gardens at any time of day if one knows how and where to look
for them, but the leaf is getting so thick that it becomes more
difficult every day to see the birds. A feeding-table to which
quite a number of the birds return morning and evening, has
been erected on the lawn near the aviary from which the birds

the rats which are all too numerous in the Gardens.
I am told that some of the birds have taken up their abode
in the Botanical Gardens, and there is little doubt that others
have spread to various parts of Regent&apos;s Park. The Superinten-
dent of the Park has taken an interest in the experiment and
instructed the park-keepers to protect the birds.

The first edition of this classical work was published
eighteen years ago, and for several years past has been very
scarce ; now a much needed second edition has appeared.
This is not by any means merely a reprint ; it comprises more
than a year&apos;s work on the part of the author, and much of the
book has been practically re-written.
We need not remind those of our readers who are versed
in ornithological literature that the author of Bird-Life of the
Borders is one of the most experienced ornithologists and
general field-naturalists of the day. One has only to read one
or two of his delightfully written chapters to see this at once.
Every chapter is fascinating, but perhaps those on migration have
delighted us most. The difficult subject is treated in the most
thorough manner and will well repay careful reading. The
chapters dealing with &amp;quot;Springtime on the Moors,&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Summer on
the Moors,&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Autumn on the Moors,&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Midnight on the Oozes,&amp;quot;
on the Waders, Grebes and Divers, are no less interesting. In
fact there is not a dull page in Bird-Life of the Borders, in which
the numerous illustrations are excellent.

style by a very versatile author. It is a collection of articles,
most of which have appeared before in such papers as The
County Gentleman, Country Life, The Field, The Spectator, and
others. Such articles are much too valuable to be scattered
about in newspapers and it is very satisfactory to find that they
have been collected together in a permanent form. Wherever
one happens to open the book one conies across something of
interest; and the chapters deal with very diverse subjects, such
as &amp;quot; The Courting of Birds,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Raven on the Pampas,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Birds

Aviculture,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Birds of an Eastern Voyage,&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Monkeys I
have met,&amp;quot; and so on. Mr. Finn believes that &amp;quot; the man in the
street&amp;quot; has more interest in natural history than he is generally
credited with, and so this volume is primarily intended for those
who do not profess themselves to be experienced naturalists, but
we venture to think that many of such might read this book with
profit. It contains a number of good photographic illustrations,
and we are able to reproduce, with the Author&apos;s and Publisher&apos;s
permission, two very good ones of the Mandarin Drake, by Mr.
W. P. Dando. Writing of this delightful bird, in a chapter
headed &amp;quot;The Courting of Birds,&amp;quot; Mr. Finn remarks : — &amp;quot;Another
specially adorned bird is the Mandarin Drake (/£lx galericulatd),
whose extravagant decorations and extraordinary contrasts of
colour seem almost incredible in a natural species. He differs
from all other ducks, even his near ally the Summer or Carolina
duck (Aix sponsd), in the chestnut hackles on his neck and the
similarly coloured fan-feather in the wings. Accordingly, when
showing off, he curves his neck back like a fantail pigeon, and
by slightly opening and inclining his wings brings his fan into
an upright position, at the same time lifting his bushy crest as
high as it will go.&amp;quot; Mandarin Ducks make ideal aviary birds if
unpinioned and given a large enclosure. They must have water,
but quite a small pond will suffice ; they perch readily, being
naturally tree ducks, and perfer to nest at a considerable height
from the ground.

IMMIGRATION OF SUMMER BIRDS*
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.966172470588235" page_id="33229259"  page_num="249" year="" vol="">
Under the heading of &amp;quot; Stray Notes,&amp;quot; on page 198 of Vol. IV.
N.S. 1906, we referred to the first Report issued by the Committee
appointed by the British Ornithologists&apos; Club to collect evidence
regarding the immigration of summer migrants. This was very
instructive and valuable, bnt it will be at once recognised that
the results of one year&apos;s observations are entirely inadequate to
elucidate the complex problems presented by this phenomenon.
The combined results of several years observations are necessary
before any definite results can be obtained, and hence it is in-
tended to carry on these observations for several years.
The Second Report is now published, and deals with the
immigration of the Spring of 1906. The number of observers
has been largely increased, but more are still required as a few
districts are still unrepresented. The Report is a valuable record
and reflects great credit on the observers and especially the
Migration Committee of the British Ornithologists&apos; Club. Those
who are interested in the subject of Bird Migration should not
fail to possess themselves of it as well as the previous Report
issued last year.

A NEW INSECTIVOROUS BIRD FOOD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99518872972973" page_id="33229260"  page_num="250" year="" vol="">
Messrs. Trower &amp; Co., of 442, Caledonian Road, London, N., have
sent us a sample of a new food for insectivorous birds, made, we under-
stand, from the recipe of Mr. Allen Silver, a well-known authority on
insectivorous cage-birds. The ingredients, the chief of which consist of
ants&apos; cocoons, dried flies, and preserved yolk of egg, appear to be of very
fine quality indeed. The price of the food is very moderate, only one
shilling per pound, at which it could not be produced were it not for the
fact that the ingredients are procured in very large quantities.
It appears to us to be an excellent food which we can recommend
our members to try. It keeps indefinitely, only requiring to be moistened
with water for use, or it can be mixed with grated carrot or mashed potato.
TINAMOUS.
Sir, — I have just got a pair of Tinamous (said to be Rhyncohris per-
dicarius). They are small birds about the size of a Partridge. As I know
nothing about this class of bird I should be glad of some hints as to
management.
At present I have them in a small grass run with wooden shelter
facing south, and I am feeding them on wheat and millet with a few meal-
worms. I have put down several heaps of fir branches in the run for the
birds to live in, as they are at present very shy.
I shall be glad to know as soon as convenient if the feeding is correct,
also if the birds will be hardy in winter and if they are easy to breed.
May I venture to suggest that an article in the Avicultural Magazine
on the various sorts of Tinamous and their management would be much
appreciated by members. C. Barnby Smith.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Barnby Smith:
I have kept one species of Tinamou only, — Crypturus tataupa, an
account of which, with a coloured plate, appeared in Vol. II. of the New
Series, pages 2S5-292 and 362-363. I am unacquainted with Nothoprocta
perdicaria, but so far as I am aware the habits of most of the Tinamous
are practically alike. The male is smaller than the female and performs
the entire duty of incubation and the rearing of the young, and moreover
these birds are polyandrous, the female laying successive clutches of eggs
to two or more males. Thus in captivity, when the hen has laid a clutch
which the male has commenced to incubate, she should be allowed to run
in another enclosure with a second male to whom she will lay a second
clutch.

The Tinamous are grain and insect eaters, and my Tat an pas fed
chiefly on the smaller seeds such as canary, millet and hemp. Green-food
is most important, and the young are reared almost entirely upon insects
for the first ten days of their lives, after which they will eat soft food of
which yolk of egg forms a fair proportion ; finely chopped green-food,
such as chickweed, should be added to the soft-food. Small seeds are
eaten after the first week or ten days. I reared my young Tataupas chiefly
on small gentles which, when properly cleaned in sand, are extremly
good and wholseome food.
An article such as you ask for would be very valuable, but so little is
known of the habits of most of the Tinamous that I do not know who is to
write it. I hope we may someday have one from you describing the uest-
ing habits of Nothoprocta perdicaria ; meanwhile you might look up the
article I have mentioned and another note in the same volume (page 114)
on Calopezas elegans.
N. perdicaria inhabits North and Central Chili, so would probably
need artificial warmth during an English winter. D. SkTh-SmiTh.

&amp;quot;THE ORIGIN OF BENGALESE.&amp;quot;
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997443043478261" page_id="33229261"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I am glad to see that Dr. Butler and Captain Perreau have
reached a point of agreement as to the origin of Bengalese, for it is a
regrettable though acknowledged fact that aviculturists feel generally
compelled to come to opposite conclusions on the majority of debatable
questions.
I expect that most of us will be ready to accept their conclusion,
namely, that the Bengalee of commerce can and has been produced from
either the Sharp-tailed Finch or the Striated Finch, or from both of these
species.
Dr. Butler concludes by asking &amp;quot;If a cross between a Striated Finch
and Bengalee at the present time results in a Sharp-tailed Finch, how was
the dark-brown-and-white variety produced at all ? &amp;quot;
Perhaps it may be of interest to mention that two of my Bengalee-
Striateds, which have been referred to several times in this connection and
which Dr. Butler rightly describes as closely resembling adult Sharp-tailed
Finches, have this year paired and produced three young.
One of these exactly resembled the parents, but the other two were a
typical dark-brown-and-white and a typical fawn Bengalese.
I think, therefore, it would be safe to assume that, after a few more
generations of in-breeding, the Sharp-tailed Finch type would disappear.
I must not omit to mention that there were no Bengalese in this
aviary, and therefore there can be no possible question as to the parentage
of these young birds. W. E. Teschemakej^_

SYNCECUS AUSTRALIS IN NEW ZEALAND:
THE NEW ZEALAND QUAIL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9832928" page_id="33229262"  page_num="252" year="" vol="">
Sir, — It was with pleasure that I read your article 011 the Quails of
the genus Cotnmix in the November number of our Avicultural Magazine,
and in showing the article to some of my friends in the locality they assured
me that the New Zealand Quail is not extinct, at an}&apos; rate in these far
northern parts of the North Island.
To make sure whether the Quail of this part is C. novat-zealandicz or
not I take the liberty of sending to you a skin of one which I obtained in
March of this year. Will 3&apos;ou be good enough to pass your judgment upon
it as to whether it is or is not C. novcs-zealandics as I am here isolated from
works of reference.
The Quail of this species (represented b}&apos; the skin) is not what one
can call numerous here, but is to be seen occasionally in pairs or quite
small parties. This summer (now just closed) seems to have been a
favourite one for Quail and other ground birds owing to the rainfall being
frequent and above the average with the consequent check upon the bush
flies which do so much to decimate bird life.
Of course if this should turn out to be C. novce-zealandic? there is
quite a possibility of your yet being able to keep and breed them in
captivity.
Trusting you will have a successful avicultural year.
Robin Kemp.
Umawera, Hokianga, New Zealand,
April 7, 1907.
[The above letter is very interesting, but unfortunately the Quail sent
is not C. novce-zealandice but the Swamp Quail {Synoecus australis) of Aus-
tralia. So far as we are aware however this species was not known to exist
in New Zealand. Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, in his Handbook to the Game Birds
gives its range as &amp;quot; South Eastern New Guinea, Australia and Tasmania,&amp;quot;
and Dr. Sharpe has not added to this range in his Hand List of Birds (1S99),
therefore Mr. Kemp&apos;s discovery is of extreme interest. — Ed.]

LORIES WASTING.
Sir, — During the last year or so I have lost two Lories ; and Mr.
Gill&apos;s diagnosis has been, &amp;quot; Syncope owing to exhaustion from nial-
assimilation of food.&amp;quot;
</bodyText>

Both these Lories were one of a pair, the other bird being plump and
in good condition, and in each case still living. My feeding is plain
biscuit finely powdered, upon which is poured boiled milk, grapes, banana,
and canary-seed for those that will eat it.
Until the birds showed great exhaustion, they looked quite well and
the feathers were close and bright, and they took plenty of exercise in
their aviaries. I should add that the sop is only slightly sweetened, and
that not every day, as I fancy the sugar is not very good for their livers.
Is there any means of guarding against this cause of death, or is it an
occurrence that must be looked for now and then ? K. J. Brook.
The following reply was forwarded to Mr. Brook : —
If your Lories were healthy when received, death should not have
occurred from the cause you mention ; there must have been something
wrong.
As far as my experience goes — ancient history now — different species
of Lories and Lorikeets occasionally need different treatment; I am under
the impression that your birds are Eos riciniata, or some near relative.
On looking back over my books, I find that here Eos riciniata was
very fond of stewed apples with plenty of juice, of banana (cut up), and of
fig cut up into very small pieces. As regards the latter, I have a garden
saucer in which I place canary, millet, and Indian millet seeds, mixed
together, and with this seed I mix dry biscuit (H. and P.&apos;s &amp;quot; Tea &amp;quot;) crumbled
small (of which E. R. was very fond) ; and on the top was placed the fig.
To this day I follow the same course (for the pair of Varied Lorikeets I
wrote about in July, 1903, which are still alive and well) ; only instead of
the fig I give cut up sultanas, and grocer&apos;s currants (previously soaked), the
best obtainable of each. I have a note that at one time E. R. voluntarily
took to canary seed, which it duly shelled. Once my Varied Lorikeets had
an extraordinary&apos; craze — which lasted some months — for spray millet (they
fly loose, and help themselves to what they have a mind to), tearing to
pieces every spray I put out : — but I cannot positively say that they ate any.
Eos riciniata was fond also of red (garden) currants and raw apple. The
juice served with stewed pears (as a treat) is much esteemed by some of
these birds.
I have always supplied rather fluid biscuit-milk (boiled) sop, sweetened
with a little castor sugar, which I have supposed, rightly or wrongly, to be
less likely to affect the liver than brown sugar. Also water, in which most
of them occasionally wash.
All the food, water, etc., should be placed 011 some high shelf in a
quiet place, not only for the purpose of keeping it uncontaminated by mice,
but also because Eos riciniata, like many others of this class of bird, is shy
of going to the ground when in an aviary.
The fault I find with your feeding is that you do not give enough-
variety. Over and over again I have noticed how the taste (to use a

<bodyText confidence="0.988953" page_id="33229264"  page_num="254" year="" vol="">
common expression) of these birds seems to change — their system cries out
for a change of food. E.R. at one time took greedily to stewed rhubarb —
an unusual taste for a bird.
More than once I have made the note against Eos riciniata, even in
summer, that it feels the cold. This is a point to be borne in mind.
I wonder if by any chance the birds you lost could have both been
females? The females are very much more nervous and timid than the
males, and might even have been half-starved in the midst of plenty, just
because their food may have been placed too low or in too exposed a place,
or the}&apos; may have been afraid of their mate or some other bird. Of course
this is only a suggestion thrown out at random.

Sir, — I shall be obliged if you can give me any information about the
rearing of young Grouse and also Great Crested Grebes. I am expecting
eggs of both the above to hatch shortly.
What food would you suggest for them ?
I presume the Great Crested Grebes would have to be hand-fed,
aud thought that crushed Whitebait would be suitable.
Could you tell me how long incubation takes in both cases.
Evei/vtn Dknnis (Mrs. Hakoijd E. Dennis).
Reply sent to Mrs. H. E. Dennis.
Young Grouse may be reared under a hen with care on mainly the
some food as Pheasants, viz. good fresh dry custard, etc., abundance aud
variety of green food, seeding grasses, small seed, dry oatmeal (groats) as
soon as they care to eat it ; fine flint grit or quartz grit and crushed baked
egg-shell should always be at hand, but never mixed with the food. Ample
shade should be provided from boughs, etc., which should be frequently
changed, and on no account let them have access to any heather, or they
will neglect all other foods.
I should not think it possible to rear from the egg the young of the
Great Crested Grebe. From the day of hatching their life is spent
practically on the water or in the dorsal feathers of their parents&apos; backs.
They are fed from the beginning on fish and possibly fresh water
insects that are caught aud immediately presented to the young by their

bred on fresh water, would be likely to thrive on marine fishes.

TWO EGGS LAID BY THE SAME BIRD IN
TWENTY-FOUR HOURS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999293222222222" page_id="33229265"  page_num="255" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I have occasionally heard doubts expressed as to whether birds
ever la}&apos; two eggs within twenty-four hours so that I think it is not without
interest to place on record two such instances that, curiously enough, have
taken place in my aviaries during the same week, although during the past
fourteen years I have previously known only of one doubtful case.
The first instance is that of a Rain Quail, C. coromandelica. The
first egg was found on the morning of the 22nd April, and when the nest
was next visited on the following Thursday afternoon it contained four eggs.
I happened to be in the aviary on the afternoon of the next day (Friday)
and was much surprised to find six eggs in the nest. As the bird in question
was the only hen Quail in that aviary, there can be no question or doubt
that she laid two eggs in the twenty-four hours.
The other case is that of a White Call Duck ; this bird had been
sitting on a clutch of ten eggs, which she suddenly deserted after some
eighteen days incubation. I removed the eggs on the evening of Friday,
the 26th, and noticed at the time that the bird appeared heavy as though
she was again going to lay. I re-visited the nest on Sunday morning about
eleven and found it to contain three fresh eggs. I am positive that I
removed all the eggs from the nest on Friday and, as in the case of the
Quail, it was the only duck in that aviary, so that the question of two birds
laying in the same nest cannot arise.
The three eggs, therefore, must have been laid during the very short
space of forty-one hours, and the case is still further remarkable from the
fact that this bird started to lay again during incubation, for there is little
doubt of that having been the cause of the desertion of the first nest.
It would be interesting to know if any of our members could furnish
further instances. J. Lewis Bonhotk.

FRENCH MOULT IN PARRAKEETS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990946625" page_id="33229266"  page_num="256" year="" vol="">
The feather disease popularly known as &amp;quot; French Moult&amp;quot; is some-
times prevalent amongst Budgerigars and is probably attribittable to over-
crowding or improper treatment. Other Parrakeets are sometimes affected,
and we have known of cases of Many-colours, Bourkes&apos; and especially Red-
rumps being afflicted with the complaint. An interesting and remarkable
case of the disease appearing amongst wild Redrumps is recorded in the
current number of The Emu, as follows :
&amp;quot; In the neighbourhood of the Adelaide Hills the Red-rumped Grass-
Parrakeet {Psephotus hceinalonotus) was up to the years 1887-8 one of the
commonest representatives of the family Psittacidce. One of the early
settlers in Mt. Baker district, who settled there in 1839, saj ? s that they were
most numerous in that neighbourhood until the 3&apos;ears named. I can endorse
this as regards the years 1S85 and 1S86, when I first visited the Colon}&apos;. In
the years 1S87-S a disease, if such it can be called, attacked the species.
When the birds moulted they did not get their feathers again ; a number of
naked Parrakeets were running about the paddocks. I caught a number of
them, and they appeared to be quite healthy, except being destitute of
feathers. I conclude that the practical extermination of this species, as far
as the Adelaide Hills were concerned, was due to their falling an easy prey
to predaceous animals. So complete was the distinction that neither my
friends nor myself observed this species in the Mt. Baker district for several
years. Even now, twenty years afterwards, this species is still comparatively
scarce, although there are a few scattered throughout the district, but no
larsre mobs.&amp;quot;

THE KAGU.
{Rhino chetus jzibatus).
The very excellent photographs by Mr. Berridge, which
are here reproduced, represent one of the most interesting and
remarkable of birds. It was discovered in 1852 when the French
occupied New Caledonia to which island it is confined. Two
living examples reached the London Zoological Gardens in 1862,
having been presented by Dr. G. Bennett. In 1866 auother was
received by presentation from the Acclimatization Society of
Sydney, while a fourth was purchased in the following year. In
1884 and 1885 two or three other examples were obtained. Since
the latter date however the species was unrepresented until last
year when a fine specimen was received by purchase, and is still
in the collection in perfect health. It is from this specimen that
the photographs here reproduced were obtained.
In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1862 (pp.
218-219) tue l ate Mr. A. D. Bartlett gave an interesting account
of the first specimens received at the Gardens. The habits of
the bird as there described may be studied almost any day from
the specimen now in the Western Aviary.
&amp;quot; With its crest erect (writes Bartlett) and wings spread
out, the Kagu runs or skips about, sometimes pursuing and
driving before him all the birds that are confined with him in
the same aviary, evidently enjoying the fun of seeing them
frightened ; at other times he will seize the end of his wing or
tail and run round, holding it in his bill : from a piece of paper
or dry leaf he derives amusement by tossing it about and running
after it. During his frolic he will thrust his bill into the grounds

and spread out his wings, kick his legs in the air, and then
tumble about as if hi a fit. At other times he appears intent
upon catching worms : lie steps slowly, his neck close to his
body, his crest flat on his back, all his feathers smooth and close ;
he raises one foot, and with two or three gentle strokes he paws
the ground, swiftly he darts his bill into the earth and draws
forth a worm, a sudden shake and it is swallowed ; again he runs ;
stopping suddenly, he makes another dart ; and thus he continues
to capture this kind of food. With respect to feeding, this bird
differs much from the Heron family, seeking out, in every hole
and corner, worms, snails, and other living things, whenever
they are not in motion : as soon as a snail is found, he
breaks its shell by repeated knocks upon the ground, and after
shaking the fragments of the broken shell off, the animal is
swallowed. In no instance, however, that I have observed, does
this bird eat bread, seed, or any kind of vegetable, but strictly
confines himself to insects and other animal substances.&amp;quot;
Mr. Bartlett remarks upon the extent to which powder-
down is developed on the plumage of the Kagu, and points out
many features which resemble Eurypyga, the Sun Bittern, a bird
to which it has since been shown, by anatomical investigation,
to possess a somewhat strong affinity. (See also Avicultural
Magazine, Vol. III., N.S. pp. 280-282.)

By R. I. Pocock, FX.S., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.,
Superintendent of the Gardens.
The Plovers&apos; Aviary in the Zoological Gardens has proved
up to the present time a conspicuous and all round success in
every particular save one : the shore birds, for whom it was
especially designed, have hitherto failed to breed. This reproach
has now been removed by the hatching of some young Avocets ;
and the occurrence, interesting in itself for the reason just stated,
is rendered doubly so by the fact that birds of this species have

never, so far as I am aware, been bred in captivity before. The
following account, therefore, may perhaps prove acceptable to
readers of the Avicultural Magazi?ie.
Towards the middle of May the behaviour of two out
of the five Avocets in the aviary suggested the likelihood of
laying being under serious consideration, possibly indeed immi-
nent ; and 011 the 15th of the month expectations were realised
by the appearance of the first egg, which was deposited on a
rough nest of dead leaves and twigs gathered into a flat or
slightly hollowed heap on the sand under the shelter of a hem-
lock and some clumps of iris. Additional protection, in the
form of cut branches of box stuck into the sand, was hastily
improvised ; and the path along the side of the aviary was
closed to the public to give the birds every chance of sitting
undisturbed.
A second egg was laid on the 18th and a third on the 20th
of May. The hen bird started to sit on the 19th ; and thereafter
the eggs were seldom if ever left for any length of time,
the cock and the hen taking turns at the incubation and
attending assiduously to their duties. The rest of the Avocets
were generally to be seen near the sitting pair ; but although to
the sentimental onlooker their bearing suggested a desire to
share in the pride of the performance successfully accomplished
by their colleagues or to display a sympathetic interest in their
family cares, veracity nevertheless compels us to admit that the
underlying motive of their behaviour was probably nothing but
the gregarious instinct deep-rooted by nature in the species.
On June the 12th the chicks were first seen. Thus the
period of incubation was, as nearly as can be computed, about
twenty-four days and not seventeen days as has been previously
stated 011 the alleged authority of Naumanu. Unhappily two of
the chicks never left the nest alive. They were apparently
killed, accidentally crushed, it is believed, by the superincumbent
hen who was roughly interfered with by the importunate atten-
tions of one inconsiderate cock. The third chick escaped the
fate that befel its fellow - nestlings and when two days old
was to be seen pecking about 011 the sand and in the shallow
water of the pond under the watchful guardianship df~4ts--

parents, which with head lowered and bill advanced resolutely
charged and put to flight every bird, from an Oyster Catcher
to a Wagtail, that ventured too near. No further use was
made of the nest, when once deserted. At night and off and
on during the day one of the parent birds, no doubt the hen r
broods over her chick in the way depicted in our illustration.

Squatting upon her hocks, she utters a whistling call ; and
the little one, running up in response to it, takes his stand
beneath her, sometimes upon one of her legs, and thrusts
his head and body beneath the breast-feathers and wing of one
side, leaving nothing exposed but his legs which look like
a pair of dwarfed supernumerary limbs depending from the
breast of the mother.
Although at first somewhat staggery and weak upon his
legs, despite their thickness and suggested strength, the chick
rapidly gained in vigour, and after a couple of days or so might
be seen pattering about independently with all the confidence
born of youth and inexperience, utterly oblivious of possibilities
of danger and fully trusting, it would seem, to his parents to
drive away every intruder. When feeding, the chick at first
resorted to the pecking action characteristic of most birds and
also of the old Avocets when eating definite particles of food

but although his bill presented at the time he was a week old
scarcely a perceptible trace of tilt, he nevertheless was seen, Mr.
Thomson tells me, though I have not observed it myself, to make
use of the lateral sweeping action to skim floating particles off the
surface of the water which is the function of the upturned bill of
the old birds. This early appearance of a habit before the
development of the structural feature upon which its proper
performance depends is worth attention, for it suggests that the
sweeping action of feeding preceded in the evolution of the
Avocet the acquisition of the upbent bill so characteristic of the
bird.
Apart from size, plumage, and colour, the most distinctive
features of the chick as compared with the adult bird are the
shortness and thickness of his legs and the shortness and straight-
ness of his bill, which falls short of the head in length. The
colouring is obviously protectively adapted to that of the littoral
arenaceous surroundings natural
to the species. The upper side
is a pale yellowish or sandy grey,
speckled and lined with black,
and the underside is white. On
the head there is a narrow median
black stripe of variable extent ac-
cordingto theindividual, and also

a variable number of subsymmetrically disposed black spots on
the crown and occipital area. From the anterior angle of the
eye a black stripe runs obliquely to the base of the beak above
the corner of the mouth ; and sometimes a corresponding black
stripe passes backwards from the posterior angle of the eye. The
anterior half of the nape of the neck is unmarked ; but its
posterior half bears two more or less irregular black stripes
which converge anteriorly and meet or nearly meet in the middle
line forming a complete or nearly complete A-shaped mark. On
the area of the back between the wings these stripes are repre-
sented by spots, and running along the sacral region to the tail
there is a median irregular band of black spots, varying in size.
Thus the back might be described as ornamented with two black
stripes, more or less broken up into spots which converge towards
a point upon the neck and fuse to form a single median stripe
upon the pelvic region. The hind quarters are also marked with
a conspicuous stripe extending from the tail across the thigh to
the femorotibial joint of the leg ; there is also an obscure spot on
the down of the outer side of the leg where the naked area com-
mences, and the upper side of the wing is speckled with black.
The beak is black with a greyish tinge 011 the base, and the legs
are grey-blue with pinkish webbing. Measurements in Mm. :
Total length from base of beak to tail about 100 (4 inches) ;
length of head 20, of beak from corner of mouth to tip 17, of
tarsus 28, of middle toe, without claw, 19.
The foregoing description and the annexed figures, repre-
senting a side view of the head and the upper surface of the
body, have been taken from the two nestlings which were found
dead on the nest. So far as can be seen the living bird resembles
them in every important respect. I have described the color-
ation in some detail because, if we may trust to the analogy
supplied by other animals, the pattern of the nestlings should
prove a useful help in determining the affinities and descent of
the species of Plovers and allied birds.
At the time of writing (June 23rd) the little bird has not
altered appreciably either in appearance or behaviour. Naturally
he has increased to a certain extent, but not much, in size, and
his beak seems to be a little longer, but without catching and

also unable to satisfy myself that there is yet any substantial
upward curvature of the extremity of the bill. He readily takes
to the water when approached and I have seen him swim strongly
across an arm of the pond to the opposite side, his pose and
progression on the water recalling those of a Coot or Moorhen.
He feeds entirely on his own account and wanders where he
pleases, showing no fear of the other birds in the aviary nor
any instinct to keep close to his parents. One or the other
of these, however, is always in attendance upon him, and the
threatening attitude above described is assumed even towards
a human being entering the aviary. I was particularly struck
the other day by the behaviour of the cock bird towards
myself. I went into the aviary to look for the chick which
was not to be seen from the outside ; and although the trio
were securely hidden somewhere out of sight in the bushes at
the back, the cock bird — or what I took for the cock — soon
appeared upon the sand and attempted seemingly to lure me
away by the device so many of us have seen practised by
Partridges. He manoeuvred near me as if to attract my
attention, and as I advanced ran away with one wing drooped
as if attempting to persuade me that injury to his wing might
make pursuit of him on my part a profitable undertaking.
Knowing from his behaviour, as well as if I had seen the chick
with my own eyes, that the latter was in safety somewhere, I left
the three undisturbed.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
It has often struck me as strange that our L,oudon dealers
are, as a rule, so extremely conservative in their importation of
foreign birds, that they are content to order and offer to the
British public the same species year after year without making
the least effort to introduce novelties : should something new to
them accidentally turn up it is either sold at a ridiculously low
price as an unknown bird ; or, if named by some chance visitor

to the shop, is offered at a price so high as to be practically-
prohibitive to any man of moderate means.
In Germany many birds are received which never rind
their way into the London bird-market ; the dealers hear of them
from travellers as common cage-birds in their native land and
they take some trouble to get consignments sent over : it is true
that, in some cases, they do not receive many specimens of a
species, because they cannot afford to send a man over to purchase
and bring them back ; but they not iufrequentl)^ get a few pairs of
species which are never seen in our bird-shops and have never
even been exhibited at our London Zoological Gardens.
To be successful as an importer of cage-birds, it is of course
best to adopt Mr. Hamlyn&apos;s plan ; to visit foreign countries and
personally superintend the catching or purchasing of the birds
and their transmission to this country ; and I am not sure that it
would not pay any dealer who could get his business attended to
during his absences, to adopt this plan : I am quite sure that it
would commend itself to aviculturists, and to all who have bene-
fited by a study of living birds.
Of the numerous pets among the natives of many lands,
most of them as easily obtainable as our English Thrush and
Blackbird, how many ever gladden our hearts ? Take the true
Thrushes as a sample : — Up to the present time probably about a
dozen foreign species have been imported into Europe, mostly in
single specimens perchance brought over by some traveller who
wanted something to amuse him during his homeward journey ;
yet all these in their own country are abundant species, frequently
hand-reared and caged by the natives : the same is true of other
birds ; five or six Blackbirds have been imported, mostly charm-
ing singers and with everything to recommend them to the bird-
lover; but, excepting for the Grey- winged Ouzel, which Mr.
Harper was enterprising enough to hand-rear and distribute
among our members, we know very little about them. Just fancy
what a pleasure it would be for any of us to put up a pair of the
gigantic Chinese Blackbird (Merula mandarina) for breeding in
one of our outdoor aviaries ! It is a very common species, breeds
near human habitations, is freely hand-reared and caged by the
natives and would be as easy to import as our British species, yet

it never arrives in the London market. The Japanese White-eye
or Spectacle-bird is another instance ; it is extremely common in
Central Japan, is a familiar friend in every bird-shop, and has
reached the German bird-market in some numbers, but it does
not seem to come to us.
The recent importations of Birds of Paradise prove that
where collectors can be sent out to secure them, even those
species which are not familiar household pets among the natives
of a country can be obtained ; yet those most beautiful birds, the
little Fruit-doves of the genus Ptilopus, are among the rarest
birds to find their way even to our Zoological Gardens, although
they are commonly caged in some of the S. Pacific islands :
possibly their owners may value them highly and charge a pro-
portionately high price for them, but one would think that a few
cheap and showy mirrors or musical-boxes would tempt most
semi-civilized savages to give up that which they could easily
replace.
Possibly Fruit-pigeons may be shunned by the importer
under a false impression as to the difficulty of feeding them on
board ship ; but I believe these birds are very accommodating in
the matter of food, and in the absence of small fruits will do well
upon chopped potato and peameal, at any rate for a time: to say
the least, it would be well worth while to put it to the test.
When there are so many common and altogether delightful
birds which could easily be secured, the indifference of most of
our dealers to this fact is somewhat exasperating : surely a little
energy would pay them well. Doubtless many of these men are
content to buy from sailors and others returning from a voyage,
taking over and over again hundreds of the same species, which
arrive as regularly and with as little variation as occurs in the
well-known stereotyped soldier&apos;s collection of tropical insects,
hundreds of which cases of rubbish must be made up by the
natives of India and China and sold, at far more than their actual
value, to privates in our army.
A little trouble in distributing rough coloured sketches of
desirable birds, as guides to the native catchers, might do some
good ; but so long as dealers are willing to buy the common
Avadavat, Black-headed Maunikin and Pekin Nightingale at so

much per hundred, and retail them at so much a dozen, there is
no doubt the wily native will continue to net them in thousands
rather than bother to seek for something less easy to capture.
A MIXED BROOD,
Holes and cavities being in great demand among certain
species of our wild birds, there is often a dispute for possession
of some particularly eligible nest site. As far as my observation
goes, if eggs have already been deposited, and the intruder
wins, the eggs are either ejected, or, if that is impossible, the
victor buries them under the foundations of her own nest, and
rears her brood on the top of the pile.
In a case that came under my notice last year, neither of
these courses was followed. For several seasons a pair of Red-
starts had occupied one of my nest-boxes fixed to the stem of
an elm tree. L,ast summer, after the Redstart had laid two eggs,
it was noticed that a Great Tit was in possession. Whether any
misfortune happened to the Redstart or whether there was a
fight, and the Great Tit proved the conqueror, I cannot say :
anyhow, the Tit added three of her own to the two Redstarts&apos;
eggs already in the box, and reared the whole mixed brood. The
five young birds were seen when full grown and on the point of
leaving the nest. This seems to me worth recording. From
the unusually small clutch laid by the Titmouse, it may be
supposed that she had already lost her first nest.
This is not the only case that I have known of a small
clutch of Great Tits eggs&apos; laid under unusual circumstances.
Four or five years ago I knew of a Great Tit which laid four
eggs in an old Blackbirds&apos; nest in a yew tree, after lining the
open cup, as usual, with hair and feathers, and in that case, too,
she reared the brood. W. H. St. Quintin.

<bodyText confidence="0.998597694444444" page_id="33229285"  page_num="267" year="" vol="">
It seems to me that the Rhea of South America (erron-
eously called the South American Ostrich, for it is not a true
Ostrich, but only allied to it) is polyandrous, that is that the
female • keeps company &apos; with more than one male for reproduc-
ing her kind, in contradistinction to birds that are polygamous ;
birds, that is, where one male has several wives. Until this year
I have only kept one pair of Rheas, so that it has been difficult,
indeed impossible, to come to any conclusion on the subject,
although even then during the past three or four years where a
female has had only one male to company with, there have been
signs of polyandry, for although the male was ever ready to in-
cubate the eggs laid by his mate, she would nearly always lay
some in different parts of the park as well as in the nest taken
possession of by the male, as if she expected other males to
appear on the scene and incubate her eggs.
This year however the evidence is stronger. Up till May
I had two females and one male. Both females laid and both
laid in the same nest, although one or two eggs were laid else-
where, and the male (a white one) duly sat on eleven of them.
So far one would say that it was a case not of polyandry but of
polygamy !
One must notice, in passing, that directly the male has
finally settled down on the complement of eggs, the females
wander away and leave him entirely to himself. After this white
male was incubating, I bought two other males. First of all a
fine grey bird of the normal type from Herr Hagenbeck, and
secondly another white male from Tring Park.
The Rheas wander everywhere, in the park and about the
water-meadows, crossing the streams which intersect these
meadows, and re-crossing.
The grey male when he arrived was placed in a large
wired-in enclosure at the top of the park near the house; the
two females which had already laid their eggs and had ceased
laying, were to be found down in the water-meadows perhaps
nearly half-a-mile distant from the new male. He immediately-
commenced booming and before many minutes had elapsed the

two females were walking up and down outside his enclosure,
endeavouring to get in. The booming of the male Rhea is a
weird sound. To begin with it is as loud when the bird is some
hundreds of 3*ards away, as when he is quite close by, and it
gives one the idea of some large quadruped with a bad ache in
his interior. In the early morning of a still summer&apos;s day, it
sounds strangely, and one expects to see a large bear troubled
with indigestion issuing from the wood near by.
L,et me return however to my subject of polyandry. The
new grey male was liberated in two day&apos;s time, and immediately
commenced courting his two new mates. In a very few days
both females were laying again, and (as I write) this male Rhea
is now incubating six or seven eggs, and he was left to his duties
by the two ladies. Then arrived on the scene the third male
(the white one from Tring Park) who was put into a smaller
enclosure with one of the females. In due time she again com-
menced laying for his edification, but he does&apos;nt understand his
duties as far as incubation goes, and the four or five eggs she
laid for him have remained uniucubated. The female which was
left at large constantly did her best to enter the enclosure, whilst
the white male (bird No. 3) courted her from inside, stooping his
head and showering out his wing feathers. Her second husband
was meanwhile on his nest close by, but she paid him no more
attention.
Another fact is that the male bird looks after the young
ones he hatches out, entirely, and would indeed drive off the
female during the first two or three weeks of the young ones&apos;
lives, if she attempted to approach too near, as I have seen her
do.
My Rheas have full freedom, they could run for miles if
they chose to, therefore it cannot be said that captivity has altered
their habits, or overfeeding either, for directly the severity of
winter is passed they have no food given to them, but pick up
their natural food in the meadows.
If a hen bird not only lays her eggs in a nest which her
mate has taken possession of, laying too in that nest after he has
commenced incubation, but also lays in other spots, and if that
bird shows no inclination whatever to incubate her eggs and is

ready to take to herself a second male and then a third one as
husbands, leaving them in their turn to incubate her eggs and
rear the young, it certainly seems to me that such birds should
be styled polyaudrous. Hubert D. Ast^ey.

Mention has already been made, in an article upon my
birds at Benhain Park, of a pair of Japanese Robins having a
nest with eggs in a laurel bush in the garden. Japanese Robins
have, I believe, been turned out at other places, at Woburn for
instance, but whether after that event any nests have been found,
I cannot say.
I turned loose about sixty of these birds in March of this
year, and for at least six weeks the majority of them kept close
&amp;quot;to heel,&amp;quot; resorting to the shrubs and bushes near the aviary,
and coming at all times of the day to feed from a dish placed in a
hawthorn tree. After that they commenced to disperse towards
the end of April, and several were seen about a mile off in a
garden.
One pair however built — that is — one pair only was dis-
covered building in a laurel bush of a loose hedge dividing the
garden proper from the woodland.
Three eggs were laid and after the hen bird had begun to
incubate them, a spinster bird came and for want of something
better to do — one may say for the want of a husband — deposited
two eggs in the nest.
I happened to take a peep one day because when passing I
saw the male bird in a tree above the nest, and on the edge of
the nest, or at any rate very close to it were two females. On
looking into the nest I saw five eggs, two of a very fresh colour
which were added after the lawful owner had commenced to
incubate her three.
These three eggs were duly hatched and I saw the three
young birds until they were ready to fly, beautiful healthy birds
of a uniform sage green colour above (I never saw their under-
pays) with the bills already half red, red as far as X. can
remember at the points, and duller at the bases.

270 Mr. W. P. Pycraft,
The following day after I had seen them so fully ready to
leave the nest, they had flown and I never saw them again, but
by the way the parent birds were chattering round me, it was
•evident that the children were there — and after that I never
saw nor did I hear even the parents. They all disappeared
■completely !
In the nest after the young had flown were the two eggs
•of the forlorn spinster looking perfectly fresh and intact. The
nest itself was as clean as the day on which it was completed, or
very nearly so. Once or twice I saw the mother-bird, when the
young were still there, on the edge of the nest to feed them, but
I never saw what she gave them because for fear of disturbing
her I never lingered or looked too closely.
That other nests were built by other Japanese Robins, I
-do not doubt, but they have all dispersed ; I see them no more,
no not one ! Whether they will put in an appearance with the
sear and yellow leaf remains to be proved, but I doubt it. It is
to be regretted, but the trial has not been without its reward.
JSTot to everyone in England is it given to go bird&apos;s-nesting and
find the nest of Japanese Robins, to look into that deep cup of
leaves and ha}&apos; lined with fine dry grass, fibrous roots and
horsehair and see the pale blue eggs dotted over with chocolate-
coloured spots, to find those eggs gone and in their place three
callow young, to watch those young until they also were gone ;
not however gone where good Japanese Robins go, for had they
been good and had they been sensible, they would not have gone
at all ; they would have remained where food in winter time
would be always at hand for them. Oh, foolish unforeseeiug Japs !

NOTE ON THE BEAK OF A NESTLING

Knowing my interest in all that pertains to nestling birds
my frieud Mr. D. Seth-Smith lately sent me a nestling of the
Many-coloured Parrakeet (Psephotus multicolor^ about a fortnight
old, which had been hatched in his aviaries.

oji the Beak 0/ a Nestling. 271
The size and shape of the beak of this specimen at once
caught my attention, and further examination revealed other
characters of interest, which, I think are of sufficient importance
to be worth bringing to the notice of the readers of the
Avicultural Magazine.
In so far as size and shape are concerned, I may remark
that in this nestling the beak was relatively very much shorter
than in the adult, and more strongly arched along the culmen.
But these points are of no great importance. The facts to which
I desire to draw attention here, concern certain peculiarities
observable along the tomia of both upper and lower jaws.
In the first place, the cutting-edge of the lower jaw in this
nestling is exposed along its whole length ; and furthermore,
rises upwards 011 either side of the upper jaw, so as to conceal
the hinder portion of the cutting edges thereof. In other words,
the lower jaw, in so far as its hinder half is concerned, at any
rate, forms a kind of trough into which the upper jaw is received.
In the adult, the cutting edges of the upper jaw embrace, the
sides of the lower extending downwards so that the tomium of
the mandible is completely concealed. This of course is the
normal relation which obtains in the closed beak among birds.
These jaws are further peculiar in that their cutting-edges
have not yet cornified, but remain soft and membranous 011 either
side, up to within a short distance of the tip of the beak.
There remains yet one other point to mention, and this not
the least remarkable. Just behind the curiously striated tip of
the upper jaw, is a well-defined notch, formed apparently, to
receive the cutting edge of the lower jaw, as they approach one
another at the symphysis.
The &amp;quot; curiously striated tip&amp;quot; to which I have just referred
demands further study, and later I hope to lay before the readers
of this Magazine the results of my research.
The beaks of nestling birds always deserve careful study :
for while in some they present undoubted ancestral characters,
in others they show 110 less evidence of having undergone
peculiar modifications to serve the ends of later requirements.
Whether the features to which I have just drawn attention are to
be regarded as belonging to this later &amp;quot; ueogenetic &amp;quot; phase,

or whether they represent ancestral &amp;quot; paleogenetic &amp;quot; characters
remains a point to be settled later.
Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Seth-Smith
for having so kindly sent me this specimen which is now incor-
porated in the collections of the British Museum, so that it will
be available for the inspection of all who may desire to see it.

THE LATE PROFESSOR NEWTON, F.R.S.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.87977128" page_id="33229290"  page_num="272" year="" vol="">
The world of Zoology, and more especially of Ornithology,
has just lost one of its greatest and best supporters, for on the
7th June last Professor Alfred Newton, F.R.S., one of the Honorary
Members of our Society, passed away in his rooms at Magdalene
College, Cambridge.
Professor Newton was born at Geneva on the nth June,
1829, and was the fifth sou of William Newton, of Elvedeu,
Suffolk, formerly M.P. for Ipswich.
He was educated privately, and during his early life his
love for birds, as well as his extreme capacity for careful and
conscientious work was shown by his keeping — in conjunction
with his brother, the late Sir Edward Newton — a daily register
of the common birds observed in his father&apos;s grounds, whereby
many valuable data as to the local movements of some of our
commoner birds were obtained. He graduated at Magdalene
College in 1853, and shortly afterwards became a travelling
Fellow of his college, visiting Iceland, Spitzbergen, Lapland,
North America and the West Indies. From observations made
on these trips, he contributed papers on the avifauna of the
countries visited. It was during one of these voyages that he
met with the accident which curtailed his activity, but until
within the last few years, he used regularly to spend some weeks
yachting on the Hebrides, with his friend, the late Henry Evans,
and on those trips never failed to study the birds met with. He
was one of the most open-minded of men, and though he had

decided views on many vital questions, he was always willing to
allow the rights of the other side. His excessive caution per-
haps curtailed to some extent the good he might have done, and
though almost invariably sympathetic with new ideas, he rarely
strongly advocated them, preferring merely to encourage, with-
out committing himself as a believer.
He was by no means a voluminous writer, but it may truly
be said that he published nothing that was not good and sound,
and his works will, we venture to predict, be still a living force
when much of the literature which passes for science in the
present day is lost and forgotten.
In 1858 he was one of those who founded the British
Ornithologists&apos; Union, and for a time, he edited their journal,
the Ibis, which is now one of the foremost scientific bird pub-
lications of the world. He was also editor for some years of the
Aves of the Zoological Record. Among his other works we
may notice the Dictionary of Birds, consisting of a reprint of
his masterly articles in the Encyclopcedia Brittannica, and much
additional matter; A Manual of Zoology first published in 1872;
The Extinct Birds of the Mascarene Islands, published in the Tra?is.
Roy. Soc. ; Zoology of Ancie7it Europe; the first two volumes of
the Fourth Edition of Yarrell&apos;s British Birds, and many other
papers in scientific periodicals.
Though perhaps it will not rank as his best book, judged
from a purely scientific standpoint, the work of his life was un-
doubtedly the Ootheca Wolleyana, a large book in two volumes,
published as a memorial to his great friend, John Wolley.
Although the first of the four parts comprising the work was
published in 1864, the last part was only completed a few months
prior to his death. The delay has undoubtedly detracted from
its scientific value, but as a memorial to one of the most energetic
and indefatigable of ornithological explorers, it will stand for
ever.
Bird Protection was a subject on which he was greatly
interested, and he was largely instrumental in getting many of
the earlier acts passed. He was also one of the Committee
appointed by the British Association to study the migration of

birds, the results of which have been so ably dealt with by Mr.
Eagle Clarke.
In our owu special branch, Aviculture, he also took the
keenest interest, and used to keep a certain number of birds,
chiefly waterfowl, at Elveden, in his younger days. He was a
Fellow of the Royal, T.inuean and Zoological Societies, and re-
ceived in 1900, one of the Royal Society&apos;s Gold Medals and the
Gold Medal of the Linnean Society.
Newton&apos;s value to the world of Science, however, cannot
be measured alone by his published works, great though they be.
He was endowed with a fascinating personality, and possessed
that instinct for discovering each man&apos;s special bent, and en-
couraging it, and there must be man)&apos; of the former under-
graduates, who studied at Cambridge during those forty-one
years in which he occupied the Professorial chair, who feel that
they owe no small part of their subsequent success in life to
his kindly help and encouragement.
His Sunday evening &apos; At Homes,&apos; where the youngest
undergraduate was as equally welcome as the oldest don, will be
treasured memories in the minds of many now scattered through-
out the world. Many an expedition has been planned, and many
a young Zoologist has gone out into the world, stimulated to
energy by the quiet, but infectious enthusiasm of his Professor.
Although educated and brought up two generations ago,
his mind never grew old, but was alert and ever receptive to the
great changes continually taking place in scientific thought, but
at the same time he retained all those best qualities of the old
time gentleman, and remained courteous, quiet, unobtrusive,
and thorough in all he did and said. Kindest of friends, truest
of gentlemen, and best of ornithologists, his place will never
again be adequately filled. J. Iy. B.
On June 28th a Redshank {Totanus calidris) hatched a brood of

The Nightjar. 275
THE NIGHTJAR.
Caprimulgus europaeus.
By Gordon Dalguesh.
The Nightjar is one of the last of our summer migrants to
arrive, and it is well towards the middle of May that its curious
whirring song is to be heard. There is perhaps no bird that has
suffered more from ignorance and vulgar superstition than this.
It has been accused of sucking goats and cattle dry, hence the
popular name &amp;quot; goatsucker.&amp;quot; Even in these days of enlighten-
ment and education keepers and others still regard the Nightjar
as &amp;quot; vermin,&amp;quot; which must ruthlessly be shot dowu at every oppor-
tunity. It is of no use trying to explain to these sort of people
that the bird is not a hawk, they simply won&apos;t believe you and
stare at you in undisguised contempt at your ignorance (?). The
old Surrey name for the Nightjar is &amp;quot; Puckeridge&amp;quot; and Bucknill
in his &amp;quot; Birds of Surrey,&amp;quot; quoting a correspondent writing in
&amp;quot;Nature Notes,&amp;quot; Oct. 1897, says: — &amp;quot;&apos;One old man near the
village of Haslemere was heard to say last summer that to his
thinking &apos; t&apos; Puckeridge is a sort o&apos; hawk &apos;at maakes a cry most
like door latch l&apos;attlin&apos; up and down, and when it flies from tree
to tree in a heveuin&apos; and maakes a great noise, folks do say as
how &apos;tis a sign of hot weather&apos; — but added the old fellow in con-
clusion — &apos; he be a hill meaning bod, he be that.&apos; &amp;quot; Besides the
name of &amp;quot; Puckeridge &amp;quot; it is known by a number of others, as
&amp;quot;Fern Owl,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Eve Charr,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Churn Spinner,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Wheel
Bird,&amp;quot; all having reference to its song. It is also known in some
districts as &amp;quot; Dame Durden,&amp;quot; and when it commences tuning up
country people will say &amp;quot;hark at Dame Durden at her spinning
wheel.&amp;quot;
As the shades of evening darken and the last day bird has
gone to roost the Nightjar leaves its retreat and flits among the
tree tops in search of the brown chafer, or chases the white moth
across the dusky moorland, uttering a sound which can easily be
imitated by vibrating the tongue against the roof of the mouth,
and can only be compared to the whirr of a spinning wheel, and
:so exactly similar are the two sounds as to deceive many people^--
as it rises and falls on the warm summer air. It will at other

unlike that of a Woodpigeon in flight, only louder and more
distinct. Anon the Nightjar will leave off chasing insects and
indulges in playful aerial gambols with its mate. A pair of birds
will haunt the same locality, year after year, arriving with due
regularity.
The favourite breeding grounds are on the Moors among
heather and fern, and in oak coppices where dry leaves strew the
ground, and the plumage so harmonizes with the surroundings
that a keen sight indeed is required to detect the crouching bird.
It will also perch on a bough, and contrary to the general rule,
along and not across it. If one should happen to flush the female
bird from her eggs she will perform that pretty stratagem peculiar
to many other birds, feigning a broken wing. Just as the birds&apos;
plumage so blends with its surroundings, so do the eggs. It is
very often impossible to find them, and I once actually stepped
on one and broke it in my search. No nest is made, the eggs
being laid on the bare ground amid flinty chalky pebbles common
on moorlands. The eggs are perhaps the most beautiful of any
of our native birds, being white, and marbled with purple brown
and grey. The Nightjar is a late breeder and I have found fresh
eggs in the middle of July. The young when first hatched are
covered with down and are fed by the parents after the manner
of pigeons. Mr. Edmund Selous has shown that the use of the
wide mouth and row of bristles by which it is fringed is to engulf
the food when the bird is feeding on small insects.
In India a species of Nightjar closely allied to our bird —
which by the way is also found there — Caprimulgtis asiaticus, is
often known as &amp;quot; Ice Bird&amp;quot; from its note which exactly resembles
the sound made by a stone when thrown along a frozen pond,
while the Whip-poor-will (C vociferus) so called also on account
of its cry is well known. Nightjars inhabit all the warm and
temperate regions and are exclusively insectivorous. Our bird
rears but one brood in the season and leaves this country in
September.

About two mouths ago a pair of Yellow-winged Sugar
Birds was sent me from a Loudon dealer, who paid me the
compliment of saying that although they were in very poor
condition, he thought I might bring them round, and I might
pay him in return what I thought fit.
The female was miserable. Her feathers were clogged
together in a sticky mess so that she was hardly able to move,
much less fly : she was thin and, as I found the day after their
arrival, she had a horrid cheese-like growth beneath the root
of the tongue. No bird ever looked more wretched!
To operate upon this growth, which seemed to me to be
the same malady that attacks pigeons, was 110 easy matter. It
meant holding a bird in one&apos;s left hand, a bird no larger than
some of the Humming-birds, open a long slender curved bill,
and hold it open, and then with the free hand, brush under the
tiny tongue with a rather stiff small oil-painting brush dipped in
&amp;quot; Lysterine.&amp;quot;
The strength of the little bird was extraordinary as
regards her bill, for I had to introduce an ivory paper-knife,
and positively prize the two mandibles apart.
In a week&apos;s time I cured her of the growth. She was
gently sponged with warm water, the only way to remove the
stickiness from her feathers, and of course kept in a warm
temperature whilst an invalid. And now, in spite of the
miserable weather of the Spring-time, the cold and the damp,
she is as sprightly and well-feathered as any bird can be.
But this is a prelude. What I want to draw the attention
of members who are interested in the subject to is this : the
Yellow-winged Sugar Birds are, I believe, kept in a glass case
(as if they were stuffed birds!) at the Zoological Gardens of
London, where no really fresh air can possibly reach their lungs.
My Sugar Birds, in spite of their having been in such a bad
condition only a short time ago, have been kept in my bird-room
with the windows (large French windows) open day and night,
and have also been frequently put out on the balcony outside -
when the weather was — well ! everyone knows what the weather

was in April, May, and June! No artificial heat in the room
either. I do not think any pair of Sugar Birds in a cage could
look more sprightly, or be stronger. Fresh air is most impor-
tant for all birds. And yet, by the Society which one would
imagine ought to know more than most people what birds
need, these and other birds are kept in hot stuffy places, and
their lives shortened accordingly.
The airlessuess of the Parrot House is proverbial, or ought
to be, yet nothing could eclipse (not even in the Australian Bush)
a male Crimson-winged Parrot in my unheated outdoor aviary,
where he has been now for about nine years, in snow, rain, fog,
and all the other samples of the climate of England. However,,
with the Cockatoo Aviary, the authorities are finding out that
foreign birds can breathe in fresh and even cold air, and not
die, although I confess that any bird within the radius of the
dirty soot-begrimed air of &apos;Loudon is decidedly handicapped, not
only as to its lungs but also its plumage.

THE CRESTED PIGEON AT LARGE.
Last year I turned out into my garden at Villa La Vigie
near Monte Carlo three pairs of these birds. One pair very soon
left the neighbourhood, but the other two pairs remained near
the Villa and since last year have built several nests.
A pair persisted in building their fragile home in the
branches of a pine tree quite near the house, and time after time
the eggs were blown out of the nest, and this year the male bird
was killed by flying against one of the telegraph wires ; the
other pair however were much wiser in their choice of a breeding
place, having chosen a tree with thick foliage which protected
the nest from the gales and storms ; they have already reared
successfully several broods, and although they change the trees
in which they make their nests, they are all within a few yards of
each other.
Again in April this year (1907) I have let loose six pairs of
the Crested Bronze-wing. They return to the garden, in which

the aviary is located, morning and night, to feed on the seed
which is placed at their disposal; but if they are nesting they
have chosen trees a long way from their former home. I hear of
their presence in villa gardens as far away as a couple of miles,
two have been seen in the Casino Gardens at Monte Carlo, and I
greatly fear that when the shooting season begins in August so-
called sportsmen may destroy the majority of the pigeons which
are at liberty. William Ingram.

The first number of this Magazine, of which we gave a
notice from the prospectus last month, has now appeared. It
contains an important paper by Mr. Howard Saunders on the
&amp;quot; Additions to the List of British Birds since 1899,&amp;quot; the date of
publication of the second edition of his excellent &amp;quot; Manual of
British Birds.&amp;quot; No less than twenty species have been added to
the list during the eight years that have elapsed since that work
appeared. Mr. P. H. Bahr writes on &amp;quot;The Home Life of the

genus Parus,&amp;quot; while Mr. Selous deals with &amp;quot; Nesting habits
observed abroad of some rare British Birds.&amp;quot; Some interesting
notes, and a review complete the number.

Rutland, the smallest County in England, with but 100,000
square acres, possesses few features which are particularly attrac-
tive to bird life, nevertheless two hundred species adorn the list
of its birds, besides a few doubtful occurrences. The Little Owl,
introduced by the late IyOrd L,ilford into Northamptonshire, has
increased to an extraordinary extent and is now common in
Rutland.
We are told that the &amp;quot; old English Pheasant &amp;quot; is probably
extinct in Rutland, the Rutland birds of the present day being
hybrids &amp;quot; between the old breed and the Ring-necked Pheasant
(Phasiamis torquatus), the Kallege or Silver Pheasant (Euplocamus
nythemems), and perhaps also the Japanese variety (Phasiamis
versicolor&apos;).&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; We can well believe that the Pheasants of Rutland
are a mixed breed, as are almost all the wild Pheasants in Eng-
land, but we doubt much if the Silver Pheasant has had any
influence on the stock. That it will cross with a true Phasiamis
is granted, but the progeny would be sterile hybrids.
Mr. Haines&apos; book shows every sign of being the outcome
of much careful research and may be regarded as a very reliable
history of the County&apos;s avifauna. It should be specially interest-
ing to Uppinghamians to the memory of whose late master, Dr.
Turing, it is dedicated.

Sir, — No doubt Mr. Phillipps is right that I was wrong. I mean
with regard to the feeding of my Hoopoes. I think however that if one
gave them heart, which is much more tender and digestible than mere raw
meat, and if one mixed the heart well up in shredded scraps amongst
finely powdered silk-worm cocoons which have been passed through a fine
sieve, adding chopped green food, grated carrot and some good insectivorous
stuff, they might do. All the ingredients must cling more or less to the
shredded heart, so that when the Hoopoes swallow these pieces, a good
proportion of the rest would be bound to go down too.
Last summer I saw two very healthy Hoopoes in the Zoological
Gardens at Hamburg, in the month of July, and they were certainly fully
adult. They were fed upon a mixture of insectivorous food and were in
good feather and condition. And I also saw some under the same conditions
at Frankfurt a/M. In either case the Hoopoes were in cages by themselves.

Cor?-esponde7ice. 281
Why should not small earthworms be placed iu a deep vessel under
damp moss, into which the birds would push their bills ? They need, I
think, a good layer of sand to run on, always clean and dry.
As far as I can remember, my Hoopoes certainly threw down their
throats the so-called &amp;quot; ant&apos; eggs &amp;quot; as sold by dealers.
Mealworm beetles would probably be very good for them.
Hubert D. Asttjey.
Sir, — I have no doubt that Mr. R. Phillipps has had far more ex-
perience of Hoopoes in confinement in this country than I have, but all
the same, the only good Hoopoes in Europe that I have seen have been
fed mainly on mealworms. One in the Frankfurt-am-Main collection had
practically nothing else: he was absolutel}&apos; perfect, and had been there
eight years. Those that have lived longest in our Zoological Gardens have
had chiefly mealworms : two or three years is about their limit of life.
The present specimen is a very good one, and has been there some time —
over two years, I think.
Abroad, I have had many Hoopoes. A pair bred annually in a crack
(originally caused by an earthquake) iu our house in the Canary Islands,
while two pairs nested in the terraced walls of the garden. Each year I
used to take a brood and place them iu a large aviary in our verandah ;
they were fed by the parents and by us as well. They showed no fear, and
when the parents had done with them they would follow us for food all
about the garden, and down into a barrauco (dry water-course) about two
hundred yards away, where they would hunt for and obtain their natural
food, viz. cricket-larvee, from under stones. We usualh&apos; had a brood of six
or seven, but these used to dwindle down to two or three by November (the
rest ceasing to come back to their aviary); while by January the others
looked so wretched that we gave them their full liberty. They had their
natural food, cricket-larvse, centipedes etc., the larvse of a beetle that is
common in the roots of a certain plant, and in addition, Carl Capelle&apos;s food,
with yolk of egg (Abrahams&apos;) added. These birds got split beaks! and I
have seen several wild birds in trouble from the same cause. I caught one
in Morocco evidently starving from having its upper mandible split.
It is amusing to see old Hoopoes feeding their young. They only
carry one insect at a time, as a rule, and quite at the tip of their beak. A
centipede is carefully folded into about four loops. The Hoopoe feeds its
young largeW on smallish centipedes about two-and-a-half inches long;
but the Roller on a very large and poisonous one, quite six inches long. I
camped once for a long time in some ruins swarming with Rollers, quite
three hundred pairs, and they brought in little else but these most un-
appetizing (to us) looking creatures. While the Hoopoes — there was a nest
within five yards of my bed — brought small brown centipedes and crickets.
If bread and milk should prove to be the best food for Hoopoes, TitTis&amp;quot;
an interesting thing, and shows on what extremely unnatural food a bird

can survive ; but this is not unique by any means, for the Eider-duck
thrives, if kept with care, on barley-meal and liver, and I believe will not
touch shell-fish, mussels etc., in confinement! and the two pigeons peculiar
to the Canar\&apos; Islands, Columba bollii and C. laurivora will not, in confine-

POLYGAMOUS AND MONOGAMOUS BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999403555555556" page_id="33229306"  page_num="282" year="" vol="">
The following correspondence appeared in The Field of May 4th
and nth last, and is perhaps worth reproducing here especially in
connection with the subject of polyandry, dealt with by Mr. Astley on
another page.
&amp;quot;With the hosts of observers throughout the world and the number of
ornithological works extant, it might well have been thought that in the
case of the larger and commoner kinds of birds all that was worth knowing
about their general habits and mode of life had long since been recorded.
According, however, to an article on the mating of birds, contributed by
Dr. R. W. Shufeldt to the April number of the American Naturalist, this is
by no means the case, and we are still in ignorance as to whether several
well-known species are polygamous or monogamous. While it is well-
known, for instance, that the Ostrich and the South American Rhea are
polygamous, it is only reported that Emeus are monogamous, and no
information appears to be available under which category Cassowaries
should be classed. The same, according to Dr. Shufeldt, is the case with
the rapidly-vanishing Kiwis {Apteryx) of New Zealand. Such information
as we have regarding the South American Tinanious points to their being
monogamous; but in this case also observations with regard to breeding habits
seem to be very imperfect and unsatisfactory. All water birds, inclusive ot
Divers, Penguins, Petrels, Pelicans, Gulls, Auks, etc., seem to be exclusively
monogamous; and with the exception of the Ruff, the same apparently
holds good for the group of Waders (Limicolce) in general, although there
is some degree of doubt with regard to the Solitary, or Double Snipe,
Darwin, in the Descent of Man, including that species among the polygamists.
The Bustard, is, of course, a well-known polygamist, but whether other
members of the group have the same habit is uncertain. The Indian
Florican are reported, however, to be polygamous, and the author
considers it not unlikely that all Bustards &amp;quot; possess strong inclinations in
this direction, even if they are not actual polygamists.&amp;quot; The Stone-Curlew,
or Thicknee, is on the other hand, monogamous. Although none seem to
be polyandrous, the game birds present a curious mixture of polygamous
and monogamous types, some affording very strongly marked examples of
the former practice, while others never depart from the latter. Whether,
however, the Button-Quails or Hemipodes are polygamous or not the
author could not ascertain, although it is known that the males, which have

same uncertainty prevails in the case of the Brush-Turkeys and Megapodes ;
while the author cannot do more than suggest that the South American
Guans and Curassows are probably a monogamous group, as the two sexes
are nearly alike. The general rule among game birds appears, indeed, to be
that when the cock is conspicuously larger and more brilliantly coloured
than his mate, the species is polygamous, and vice versa. It is, however,,
not known with certainty whether the Argus Pheasant is a polyganiist,
although it probably comes under the same category as other Pheasants,,
all of which have large harems. With the monogamists are included
Partridges, most Grouse, and all Ptarmigan, but Sagecock, Capercaillie, and
Blackcock, together with Quail, are as markedly polygamous. Although
Peacocks retain their polygamous nature under all circumstances, domesti-
cation in certain instances causes some strange changes in the breeding
habits of game birds. Guineafowls, for example, are normally monogamists,
but in confinement a cock has been known to take charge of some half-
dozen hens, and these, too, without interfering with the number of eggs
normally laid by the latter. This last instance indicates the necessity of
caution on the part of observers who may endeavour to supply the gaps in
our knowledge indicated by Dr. Shufeldt from birds kept in a state of
captivity.&amp;quot;
From The Field, May nth, 1907.
&amp;quot;Sir, — In The Field of May 4th appears a communication under this
heading, in which an article by Dr. Shufeldt in the American Naturalist
is quoted. It appears to me that main&apos; of the conclusions arrived at are
very far from correct. In the first place we are told that &amp;quot;it is well known
that both the Ostrich and the South American Rhea are polygamous.&amp;quot;
There appears to be little doubt, however, that the Ostrich is strictly mono-
gamous in a wild state, and success in breeding from tame birds can only be
assured by carefully pairing off the birds, or allowing them to pair off
naturally. Hunters tell of the finding of Ostrichs&apos; nests owned by a single
pair of birds, no others being within several miles ; and in an account of
Ostrich farming in South Africa which appeared in the Ibis for January,
1906, the author clearly proves that these birds are not polygamous, and will
only breed successfully in pairs.
&amp;quot; Now for the Rhea. It is well known that in these birds the male
performs the duty of incubation, and it would seem to be almost an
impossibility for a species in which this is the rule to be polygamous. It
would be quite impossible for a single male to incubate all the eggs laid by
all the hens of a harem, and the waste of eggs would be enormous. There
is very little doubt, I think, that Rheas are polyandrous, and that those
observers who have credited the species with polygamy have mistaken the
sexes.
&amp;quot;The case of the Guinea-fowl, a naturally monogamous species^,
becoming polygamous in captivity is quoted as an instance showing the

necessity of caution on the part of observers in accepting results of experi-
ments on birds in captivity, but though the habits of a species may
undergo certain change after many generations, the wild habits remain
almost unaltered for the first few generations at any rate, and a careful
•observer may discover many points connected with their life-history that it
would be quite impossible to find out from the wild birds in their natural
habitat. The results, therefore, of some experiments in the breeding of
the Tinamous and Hemipodes should be entitled to consideration. In
France M. Dulaurier has experimented with the breeding of the Martinetta
or Crested Tinamou, and in England I have done so with the Tataupa
{Crypturus tataupa) and in both cases I think we have proved conclusively
that these two Tinamous at any rate are polyandrous. I would refer those
who may be interested in this subject to the Bulletin de la Societe Nationale
■d&apos;Acclimaiation de France for October, 1903 ; to the Avicullural Magazine
for August and October, 1904; and to the Proceedings of the I Vth International
Ornithological Congress, 1905, page 667-669.
&amp;quot; With regard to the Hemipodes, of the breeding habits of which Dr.
Shufeldt seems to be in ignorance, as with the Rheas and Tinamous, the
males perform the duties of incubation. The male is, with most species,
not only duller but much smaller than the female, and it is as much as he
■can do to cover the clutch laid by one female, and it would be impossible for
him to incubate the combined clutches of two or more birds. Hence
polygamy would be impossible. I have kept several species of Hemipodes
in captivity, and two, the Indian Turnix tanki and the Australian T. varia,
have bred freely under my observation. The female does all the courting,
and after she has paired and laid her clutch of four eggs, and the male has
commenced to sit, she leaves him and recommences her booming call, which
suggests that were there another male available she would pair with him,
and thus show herself to belong to a polyandrous species, like the
Tinamous. The results of my experiments with Turnix were published
both in the Avicultural Magazine and in the Proceedings of the Ornitho-
logical Congress above referred to. Hemipodes are certainly not polyga-
mous, they may be strictly monogamous ; but their habits certainty tend to
suggest that they are polyandrous, though I have never been able to prove
this. David Seth-Smith.&amp;quot;

HUMMING-BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994709444444444" page_id="33229315"  page_num="285" year="" vol="">
By Albert and Hugo Pam.
Last year the Editor wrote some remarks on the subject
of the few Humming-Birds which were brought back from South
America for the Zoological Society. Since that first trial another
small consignment was brought over in the month of June of
last year, and last May we again succeeded in landing twenty
Humming-Birds, which were duly deposited in the Society&apos;s
Gardens on the 27th of that month. The death of the last sur-
vivor of this consignment has caused us to review the facts
which these three trials have brought out, and also the experience
gained by us in the feeding and care of these small birds, which
has been largely increased since the first article appeared in this
Magazine on the subject.
The last consignment of twenty birds was put on board
the mail steamer in La Guayra in good condition, and the last
bird to survive died after having been in captivity in London
between four and five weeks. Inasmuch as this bird was caught
about a fortnight before it left Venezuela, and the voyage took
sixteen days, we can roughly state that it was in captivity for
about nine weeks.
It has now therefore been clearly proved that Humming-
Birds, under favourable conditions, can be kept in captivity for a
short time even in this country ; but we have regretfully come
to the conclusion that, owing to the climatic conditions which
obtain in England, and the uncertainty of the weather, it is not
to be expected that these little birds can be kept in a cage for
any considerable period in England.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.988897325" page_id="33229316"  page_num="286" year="" vol="">
286 Messrs. Albert and Hugo Pam,
There remains no doubt in our minds at all that, apart
from the question of feeding, the most important requirements
of these birds are sunshine and fresh air, and, except under very
particularly favourable conditions, these two requirements can
very seldom be obtained together inside a London building.
The question of heat is to our mind a minor consideration,
provided that the temperature does not fall very much below 55
to 6o° at any time, but an adequate supply of bright light and
fresh air is an absolute necessity.
If during a warm summer one could liberate a number of
these birds in a large open-air aviary (naturally with a very
small mesh wire) in which a good supply of flowering plants had
been placed, we consider that there is no reason why they should
not live until the late autumn, but the great difficulty of keeping
these birds in small cages is this that, in a house such as
the Insect house, in which they were placed in the Zoological
Gardens, they must be protected against the draughts caused by
the doors being continually opened and shut, and the tempera-
ture being kept fairly high causes the air to be too &apos; stuffy&apos; and
the ventilation deficient.
It will therefore be seen that it is practically impossible in
this country to obtain the ideal conditions which would permit
of Humming-Birds being seen in captivity in all their splendour
and colouration, and we have therefore decided that unless some
new scheme can be devised which would give these birds more
natural conditions in which to live, we must give up our efforts
to introduce them into this country.
It may be of some interest to the readers of this Magazine
to hear of the plans which we had worked out for bringing over
and keeping here this last consignment.
We had carefully discussed the question of the food with
Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, and had come to the conclusion that the
solution of molasses sugar, with the vegetable extract Marmite
added did not contain a sufficient quantity of albuminoids to
sustain life for any length of time. We therefore decided on the
following plan. Every other day we added to a solution of the
molasses sugar a quantity of well beaten up white of egg, and
we found that the birds readily took this food and did very well
on it.

on Humming-Birds in Captivity. 287
When the birds arrived in the Zoological Gardens we also
gave them a small quantity of sweetened milk which they took
very greedily indeed, but we are unable to say whether this food
was really beneficial or otherwise.
In the former consignments we had experienced consider-
able difficulty owing to the fact that the birds, in taking the
thick solution of molasses sugar, very often dipped their feathers
into the feeding glass, and owing to the sticky nature of the
solution were thus often prevented from flying properly. This
question was most important as the only movement which a
Humming-Bird is capable of is that of flying. It cannot walk
or hop, and if it wishes to move half-an-iuch along the perch on
which it happens to be sitting it has to make use of its wings.
In order to eliminate this danger we arranged for the glasses
containing the solution to be fixed outside the cages with just
sufficient opening for the birds to put their beaks through, and
thus drink without any possibility of making their feathers
sticky. This answered very well indeed, after the birds had got
used to finding their food, but caused a considerable mortality
before they had learnt how to get at it.
Altogether we succeeded in getting thirty-three Humming-
Birds of different species on board the steamer at La Guayra,
Venezuela, and of this number twenty reached London alive.
On board ship the same difficulties which are mentioned above
were met with, and it was very difficult to place the cages in
such a position that they obtained a sufficient quantity of light
and air without being in a draught. But thanks to the interest
displayed in this venture by all the officers and men of the s.s.
&amp;quot;Trent&amp;quot; and to the facilities granted by the Chairman of the
Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. the trouble of bringing the birds
over was very much reduced.
We think that we can now safely say that there are 110
insuperable difficulties in the way of bringing Humming-Birds
alive to this country. The food which, after many trials, we
decided to give them was sufficiently nourishing to keep the
birds in good health and condition : but the one point over
which we unfortunately had no control was the uncertaiMyj)f,
the weather, and inasmuch as even in its native state the

288 On Humming. Birds in Captivity.
Humming-Bird. droops and is miserable at all times except when
the sun is shining brightly, it is no wonder that in the London
climate the birds cannot live for any length of time.
It must be recognised that the Humming-Bird is to a great
extent, if not entirely, insectivorous, and that a sugar solution
alone is under no circumstances sufficient to keep it alive. That
is the reason why the natives of South America have never
succeeded in keeping these birds in captivity for more than a few
days. In Venezuela itself we have kept Humming-Birds in cages
for between three and four months, and we are convinced that
under suitable conditions, with proper care and individual
attention, there is no reason why they should not live in captivity
as well and as readily as most other insectivorous birds. In any
case the actual length of the Humming-Bird&apos;s life has never
been established, but it is hardly to be expected that it would
extend over any considerable time.
One point is absolutely certain, and that is, that of all the
different birds which we have at different times kept in captivity,
both abroad and here, the Humming-Bird is by far the tamest.
It knows no fear, and a very few minutes after it has been caught
will sit on one&apos;s finger and take its food. It is a bird of more
than average intelligence and very readily adapts itself to its
surroundings. Altogether we have kept a large number in
captivity, and do not recollect one case in which a Humming-
Bird has failed to make itself at home in its cage within a very
short time after it has been caught. Even in their wild state these
birds enter without fear inhabited rooms and balconies, and have
often been known to build their nests and hatch out the young
inside rooms, halls, etc., allowing the passers-by to watch them
sitting on their eggs and feeding their young.
In conclusion, we may repeat that the Humming-Bird is,
above all, a creature of sunshine and liberty: in its habits it
resembles a tropical butterfly much more than a bird, and the
same ideal conditions which would be necessary to keep the
former in captivity are also required in the case of Humming-
Birds. For those who have seen these beautiful birds free in
their native state, it can but be a sad sight to note their ruffled
plumage and dejected appearance in captivity ; and it has made

us vety miserable to watch them slowly dying for the want of
that sunshine which is so essential to their life. All lovers of
animals will therefore understand our reasons when we say that
we shall not try again to import Huniming-Birds into England.
[We feel sure that aviculturalists in general will be very grateful to
Messrs. A. and H. Pain for the amount of trouble they have taken to
introduce living Humming-Birds, and to give us in this country an
opportunity of studying these wonderful birds. The last consignment
which arrived unfortunately came in for one of the most sunless Junes on
record. Had they been favoured with the amount of sunshine that one
expects during an English summer, and perhaps if the}&apos; had had a somewhat
less stuffy cage, the}&apos; might have lived longer. At any rate we do not think
the experiment can be regarded as quite a failure, and, although we quite
understand Messrs. Pam&apos;s reason for not wishing to repeat the experiment,
still we believe that under more favourable conditions Humming-Birds
could be kept in this country for some time. — Ed.]

When the Editor of the Avicitltural Magazine asked me to
write an account of my aviaries I felt that he had asked me to do
something disagreeable, like making a speech or listening to a
budget debate. However, I will do my best, and he can scrap
any part of this paper he does not think of interest— all of it if
he thinks right — and he may use his blue pencil to his heart&apos;s
content.
Foreign birds, especially those of the parrot kind, have
always taken my fancy, and for a number of years I have kept
one or more confined in cages. There always seemed to me to
be something wanting — some touch of life and movement — in a
bird kept confined in even the largest cage possible in a room ;
so, about two years ago, I set about building substantial aviaries
in which my birds could get a considerable amount of freedom,
and yet not so large that the inmates could not be easily and
closely watched.
My aviaries vary slightly in size, but, speaking generally,
they consist of a room 6ft. by 10ft. and about 14ft. high, aud^his— -
room opens by half doors into a flight about 6ft. by 16ft. by 10ft,

290 Mr. E. J. Brook,
some of the flights however being considerably larger. There is
a passage at the back of the inner rooms that can be heated if
required, and from which the birds can be observed without
causing disturbance. This passage is divided by doors at every
18ft. to cut off draughts.
Like all other aviculturists I have experienced both the
joys of success and the mortification of disappointment ; but
careful watching, air, good food, cleanliness, and advice freely
and generously given by members of the Society are making the
joys of aviculture more numerous by a long way than these
disappointments.
When I first began aviculture my losses were mostly
among the Lories, which usually died from fits, and among the
seed-eating parrots which often succumbed to apoplexy, both
brought about from error in diet ; but recently I lost two birds
through accident, which caused my aviary man, who was nearly
in tears, to exclaim, &amp;quot;Well! at first it was fits and apoplexy, now
it is bashed heads and broken necks,&amp;quot; and my only way to com-
fort him was to point out how low our per ceutage of loss was
amongst so many birds.
Birds are strange creatures and do odd things. For in-
stance, a hen Crimson-wing Parrakeet lays two eggs now and
then, and sits on them closely now and then, which is not of
much use. One pair of eggs this bird laid I placed under a Rock
Peplar that had just commenced to sit on only one egg, and the
result is most satisfactory.
Last Autumn in one aviary there was a pair each of White-
eared Conures and Golden-headed Conures ; the White Ears laid
eight eggs and reared seven young in a small hollow log. The
nest was rather crowded with this family, but in spite of this the
Golden Heads also used the log as a sleeping place at night.
I am often asked which kind of birds I like best, and my
answer is always Lories and Lorikeets, but that these birds are
only suitable for aviaries, and where great care and attention can
be given. I always find the Lories the most amusing and the
tamest birds in the aviaries ; one of a pair of Red-naped Lori-
keets delights in searching me all over and it is impossible to
frighten the bird. The cock of a pair of Blackcap Lories you

can do nearly anything with, but the. end of a game is generally
a sharp nip and what sounds very like a roar of laughter from
the bird. My first experience of offering three Black Lories
{Chalcopsittacus ater) a basin of warm water was that, with a loud
scream, the whole lot tumbled in and began to splash; now if
I hold the bath in my hands I put on a mackintosh.
Recently, owing to the kindness of a member of the Avi-
cultural Society, my aviaries have been enriched by the addition
of one Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise, one Red Bird of Paradise,
and some King Birds of Paradise, all in most beautiful condition ;
also a pair of a new species of Lorikeet that I understand has
just been named by Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, at a meeting of the

My experience of keeping birds in aviaries is that the most
dangerous time of the year is the Spring, when there is a hot sun
and a cold wind combined ; this is far more dangerous than any
amount of general cold, and usually nips the hardy kinds that
have borne the cold of Winter with impunity. Another thing
I notice is that very few birds like the hot sun, and in warm
summer weather the only time the majority of them are out in
the open is in the evening and early morning.
I do not know whether there is any medical virtue in it,
but I find that many birds are very fond of a slab of old oak
bark and that they eat a good deal of the outer bark of the slab.
If I may venture on advice to any who are thinking of
keeping Parrots and kindred kinds of birds in aviaries, but who
have at present no experience, I would suggest that they begin
with some easily kept species, and as they gain experience add
the more delicate and more uncommon kinds. Let the beginner
make up his mind not to keep more birds than he can keep
properly, and to feed his charges only on the best food even
though the extra cost is considerable.

THE PARTRIDGE PIGEONS OF AUSTRALIA.

The two species of Pigeons forming the genus Geophaps
are known to the Australian colonists as &amp;quot;Squatter Pigeons&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot;Partridges&amp;quot; from their terrestrial habits. In this respect they
closely resemble Lophophaps, the Plumed Pigeons, which are also
very Partridge-like in their habits of running swiftly over the
ground and rising like gallinaceous birds. It is convenient how-
ever to confine the term &amp;quot; Partridge Pigeon &amp;quot; to the two species
of Geophaps, the others being known as &amp;quot;Plumed Pigeons&amp;quot; or
&amp;quot; Plumed Doves&amp;quot; (cf. Avic. Mag. Vol. V. p. 51). The Partridge
Pigeons or Partridge Bronzewings, are fine plump birds, about
the size of English Partridges. They nest and roost on the
ground, rarely perching on trees, though they sometimes fly up
on to stout horizontal branches. Both species possess a low
crooning coo.
The Partridge Brouzewiug Pigeon, Geophaps scripta (see
plate) is said to inhabit North-Western and South-Eastern
Australia. It is quite one of the most handsome of Australian
Bronzewings. The prevailing colour is greyish-brown, the wing-
coverts being edged with a much lighter baud, the head
conspicuously marked with black and white, the flanks white,
and a metallic green speculum on the wings. The sexes are
alike in plumage. The male of this species displays in the
same way as others of the Australian &amp;quot; bronze-wing &amp;quot; group,
namely hy bowing and throwing up the wings and tail.
These Pigeons seem to be perfectly hardy, three speci-
mens in my aviary having endured the cold of last winter with
apparently no discomfort. They live on good terms with other
birds except other nearly allied Pigeons such as G. sviithi or
Lophophaps. I have not been successful in breeding G. scripta,
but fertile eggs, which were hatched under Barbary Doves, were
obtained from a pair kept in the Zoological Gardens in 1891,
but apparently no young were reared to maturity.

colouring being olive brown, the flanks white, the eye surrounded
by a large patch of naked red skin which in its turn is surrounded
by a narrow band of white feathers, the speculum on the wings
is purple with greenish reflections. I have possessed four
specimens of G. smithi and found them similar in habits to G.
scripta. The Zoo. has possessed one pair, and another pair was
kept for some time by Mrs. Johnstone. I have been unsuccessful
in my attempts to breed this rare Pigeon although I have got as
far as chipped eggs.
A pair were most anxious to nest, but would insist on
doing so in the winter when they inhabited a somewhat crowded
aviary where the eggs invariably came to naught. They usually
elected to make their nest, which consisted of a scratch in the
ground and a few bits of hay or small sticks, in the corner close
to the door of the aviary, so that it was impossible to enter with-
out disturbing them. When disturbed the sitting bird would
run away and beat violently at an imaginary enemy with its
wings. The two birds took turns on the nest like other pigeons.
In April they were allowed to go out into the large open aviary,
and here they immediately nested under a thick clump of brush-
wood, an excellent place where all would doubtless have gone
well, had it not been for our most tr}nng English weather. So
far as I could judge incubation lasted seventeen or eighteen days,
but I was not quite certain when it commenced. One day I
noticed both birds off the nest together, an ominous sign, and I
discovered one egg with a dead chick half way out of it, the
other with a dead chick just about ready to hatch. There had
been quite a sharp frost in the night. After this the birds
evidently considered the breeding season to be over as they made
no further attempt at nesting. The chick was thinly covered
with whitish down, not naked as with most pigeons.
It will perhaps be of interest to quote Gilbert&apos;s notes on
this species in a wild state, as quoted by Gould in his &amp;quot;Hand-
book.&amp;quot; He writes : &amp;quot; Like the G. scripta this bird, which at Port
Essingtou is termed the Partridge, differs considerably from its
congeners in its general habits, flight, voice, mode of incubation,
and the character of its newly hatched young. It is rather^
abundant in all parts of the Peninsula, is mostly seen in small

families and always on the ground, unless when disturbed or
alarmed ; it then usually flies into the nearest tree, generally
choosing the largest part of a horizontal branch to perch upon.
When it rises from the ground its flight is accompanied with a
louder flapping or burring noise than I have observed in any
other Pigeon.
&amp;quot; Its note is a coo, so rolled out that it generally resembles
the note of the Quail, and which, like that bird, it scarcely ever
utters but when on the ground, where it frequently remains
stationary, allowing itself to be almost trod upon before rising.
Its favourite haunts are meadows covered with short grass near
water, or the edges of newly burnt brush. It would seem that
this species migrates occasionally from one part of the country
to another ; for during the mouths of September and October not
a single individual was to be seen, while at the time of my arrival
and for a month after they were so abundant that it was a com-
mon and daily occurrence for persons to leave the settlement for
an hour or two and return with several brace ; in the latter part
of November they again appeared but were not so numerous as
before ; and in the January and February following they were
rarely to be met with, and then mostly in pairs, inhabiting the
long grasses clothing the moister parts of the meadows.
&amp;quot; It incubates from August to October, making no nest,
but merely smoothing down a small part of a clump of grass and
forming a slight hollow, in which it deposits two eggs, which are
greenish white, one inch and a quarter long by seven-eighths of
an inch in breadth. The young bird on emerging from the egg
is clothed with down like the young of the Quail.&amp;quot;
The last sentence in the above interesting notes has given
rise to a mistaken idea that Geophaps is much more closely allied
to the game-birds than other Pigeons, and should therefore be
classed with these.
In his paper &amp;quot; A Review of Recent Attempts to Classify
Birds,&amp;quot; read before the International Ornithological Congress at
Budapest in 1891, Dr. Bowdler Sharpe proposed to separate the
pigeons belonging to this genus from the true Pigeons and
associate them with the Turnices, an arrangement which would
not meet with the support of those who know these birds in a

living state. The Geophabes are perfectly true Pigeons and,
except that they are purely terrestrial, are almost identical in
their habits with the other Bronzewings of Australia. Both
species are very rare in captivity.
On February 2nd 1892, Dr. Sclater exhibited (in spirit),
at a meeting of the Zoological Society, two nestlings of G. scripta
which had been hatched in the Zoological Gardens on the 7th
of June 1891, also an egg of the same species, and made the
following remarks (P.Z.S., 1892, pp. 76,77)&apos;: &amp;quot; I cannot at all
agree with Dr. Bowdler Sharpe in his recent proposal to divide
the very natural order &apos; Colunibse &apos; into two portions, and to
associate the Geophabes or Ground Pigeons with the Gallinaceous
birds.
&amp;quot; According to the observations we have made from time
to time in the Society&apos;s Gardens, where several species of the
Ground-Pigeons* have bred repeatedly, the young of the Ground-
Pigeons when hatched are nearly naked and quite helpless, and
differ in no respect from the young of the typical &apos; Columbse/
In proof of this I exhibit two specimens of the j&apos;oung of the
Partridge Bronzewing Pigeon {Geophaps scripta), hatched in the
Gardens on June 7th last, and about fourteen days old when they
died. It will be observed that at this date they were barely
covered with feathers and hardly fledged. In fact one of them
was actually killed by falling from a slight elevation in the
aviary, having been hatched in the nest of a Barbary Turtle-dove
(Turhir risorius), to which the egg had been removed in conse-
quence of the bird that laid it refusing to sit upon it. It cannot
therefore be said that these birds are &apos; able to run soon after
birth.&apos; Nor, in the reference given by Dr. Sharpe, does Mr.
Gilbert, so far as I can gather from his remarks, say so ; he
merely states that &apos; the young bird on emerging from the egg is
clothed with down like the young of the Quail.&apos; &amp;quot;
N. B. — In the photograph, here reproduced, the bird in
the background is an Australian Quail (Coturnix pectoralis).
* Under the term &amp;quot;Ground Pigeon&amp;quot; Dr. Sclater includes Phaps, Ocyphafis, anckoiheF-
forms which are quite as arboreal as they are terrestrial.

In a family in which all the male birds are conspicuous for
their handsome markings, the Baikal Teal is in my opinion the
most beautiful species, though perhaps closely rivalled by the
Falcated Teal.
Owing to its rarity and consequent high price, it is seldom
seen in captivity in this country, and as some of our members
may never have seen an example, it may be as well to describe
roughly its leading characteristics.
In size it is half as large again as the Common Teal
(Neltio?i creccd) and sits high in the water. The bill is black ;
the top of the head is brown with lighter and darker markings,
but at a little distance it appears to be a uniform dark brown. A
light streak extends from the bill, passing above the eye and
meeting in a point at the back of the head. The cheeks are
divided up into stripes of metallic green which appear quite
bronze in some lights, the feathers between these stripes being
cream-coloured.
The breast is rather pinker than a Widgeon&apos;s, with black
spots : the sides are bluer than in the Common Teal, and the
pencillings are smaller and less noticeable ; there is a crescent-
shaped patch of white just below the shoulder, but the most
noticeable features are the beautiful elongated scapular feathers,
dark chestnut on the outside, black in the centre, and light
creamish brown on the inside; these feathers hang down so as to
touch the water when the bird is swimming, giving it a very
curious appearance when viewed directly from behind. The
back is brown with lighter and darker markings ; tail brown,
under tail coverts black, with a small splash of chestnut at the
base of the tail.
The duck is rather richer in colouring than the Common
Teal, and has a cream patch on either side of the head at the
base of the bill.
I had never seen a living example of this species till last
August, when I saw a pair at an Agricultural Show in Stafford-
shire, the drake of course being then in eclipse plumage. On

looking them up in the catalogue I found that the price asked
was ^50! However I wrote to the exhibitor and eventually-
bought them at a very reasonable figure.
When showing off the drake lowers his head and then
throws it up, at the same time elevating the feathers on the top
of his head so that they appear almost like a crest, and muttering
his note, a monotonous grunt, which he keeps up for hours on
end, occasionally varying it with a double grunt!
The duck is a very quiet bird, and in my pair much shyer
than the drake ; the latter is just going into eclipse as I write and
was much later than most drakes in assuming his full plumage
last winter, as it was not complete till the end of December,
though I have often known Shovellers and Garganey later even
than this.
I hope next year to be able to report on their breeding
habits as I shall have them on a stream in an enclosure by them-
selves ; this season my pond is too overstocked with ducks — and
rats, to expect any results.
I read with interest that an immature drake was caught
last year in England which I think must have been an escaped
one. I believe I am right in saying that the Duke of Bedford
has, or had. a large stock of these lovely birds, so possibly this
specimen was bred at Woburn.
I may mention that the speculum in this species is nearly
entirely black with very little green.
TAMBOURINE DOVES, &amp;c.
By A. G. ButlKR, Ph. D.
I have not heard the opinion of bird-breeders generally
respecting breeding-results this year ; but I know that, as regards
my birds there is little to record so far: — my cock Gouldian
Finch broke his wing in his violent efforts to prevent me from
catching him out of his cage, so that (as he died the next day)
my prospect of continuing to breed that species was quashed at
the beginning of the season. My Diamond-doves also were
disinclined for greater freedom and the hen temporarily lamed
one wing in her efforts to avoid the net ; she recovered in a week

without result ; the eggs were clear ; two days later she began to

sit again.
Greenwing Doves paired but did not build or lay : and
now to come to the Tambourine Doves.
I caught and turned out my old pair on May 12th, and
shortly after heard the cock-bird sounding his tom-tom (the
song is far more like that than the tambourine).
In June, although I had found no shells on the floor of
the aviary, I was convinced that young had hatched ; because
the cock bird disappeared during the day, the hen only being
visible : I would not, however, risk disturbing them by venturing
to that end of the aviary until the end of the month, when the
cock bird began to coo again and I feared that the young must
have died.
The nest made this year was placed quite two feet higher
up than that of last year and was absurdly small for the species :
for some time I could not see it and was just turning away under
the impression that I had been deceived as to the birds having
young when there was a violent fluttering and the nestlings
alighted on the branches below it. I just glanced at the empty
nest and made haste to leave the aviary.
On the 1st July I opened the door at the farther end and
looked in : I saw one of the young birds waddling along on the
floor below the thicket of branches on which the nest was built
and went away satisfied. On the 2nd both of the old birds were
at the end of the aviary farthest from the nest and the cock bird
was cooing to the hen. I could see nothing of the young, and
after waiting some time, I went inside to investigate : eventually
I found one of them sitting up dead close to the wall at the back
of the thicket. So far as I could judge this bird appeared to be
about three weeks old ; well-feathered but with the tail-feathers
only partly out of their sheaths : I sent it off to the Natural
History Museum.
In the afternoon of the same day I saw the second young
bird crouching on the ground half way down the aviary and
panting : I picked it up and found that the parents were
not feeding it : I therefore placed it in last year&apos;s nest, where I

thought they were more likely to pay attention to it ; but if they
fed it at all they evidently did not satisfy its needs, as on the 3rd
I found that it had followed them to the other end of the aviary
where it lay on the floor dead.
The question is — Has the incessant cold and damp of the
present summer anything to do with the neglect of their young
by these birds, or have they been too highly fed ? In the mixture
provided for them there is a certain amount of hempseed, all of
which the Doves swallow greedily ; and, although with the same
mixture this same pair successfully reared one male youngster, I
am inclined to believe that the birds would have done better on
millet and dari alone. At the same time there seems to have
been a general failure in results among all types of birds this
j^ear.
A few weeks back I noticed an article in &amp;quot; Canary and
Cage-bird Life &amp;quot; upon the results from a number of pairs of
finch-mules : in each case the eggs were incubated the full time
but proved infertile.
My Goldfinches built a neat little nest in one of my indoor
aviaries, but the hen died egg-bound with the first egg. I turned
out a pair of Pintailed Nonpareils and they have not even built
up to the present time; but perhaps, like the Gouldian Finch,
they begin their moult in June and will not do anything until
that is over.
I turned out an Orange Weaver with two hens of its own
species and one of the Napoleon Weaver : the cock bird has not
even attempted to build yet, though I have known this bird to do
so while yet in its winter dress : it is now just beginning to show
the first traces of orange in the plumage and therefore is much
behind the Grenadier Weaver, which was in full breeding-
plumage a mouth ago.*
Several pairs of Australian and African Grassfinches of
various species have built and been pretty energetic in defending
their nests, but hitherto none of them have laid eggs : there
must be something wrong with the season to account for such a
* I believe this bird would breed with the hen of any other Weaver ; it displays itself
and sings to every bird in the aviary and especially a White Barbary Dove, with whi ch it _^

general failure in results ; but possibly some of our members
have been more fortunate than I have.
My Cockatiels seem very busy over a large nest-box (of
the cigar-box pattern), they have stuck to it constantly for the
past month, but whether they have young or not I am unable to
say : I know that they have been laying and smashing eggs in
all sorts of places for many months past ; indeed one hen died
from exhaustion in consequence of this incessant laying, so that
I am not particularly sanguine about the result of the present
manoeuvres.*
If the weather would but improve, there is still time to do
something this year, but I am afraid it is too much even to hope
for now that winter has continued into July.

In the last issue of the &amp;quot; Avicultural Magazine&amp;quot; it may be
remembered that I described certain peculiarities of the beak in
a nestling Psephotus multicolor. I have now the good fortune to
be able to draw attention to some interesting facts concerning a
nestling Calopsittaats nov/z- hollandice given me by Mr. H. E.
Bishop, to whom my best thanks are due.
This nestling, which is of about one day old, has the
upper surface thickly covered with long, canary- coloured down,
umbelliform in character. The head however is bare except for
a few weak down-tufts extending, from the eye backwards, over
the parietal region, leaving the crown of the head and frontal
region bare. The under-surface of the body is entirely bare, a
few minute almost bristle-like down-barbs faintly indicating the
course of the ventral feather tracts. The arm and forearm are
thickly down-clad, but the hand is bare — that is to say of the
upper surface of the hand. The whole under side of the wing
is bare.
* Since writing&apos; the above I have heard one young one being fed : it appears that
since it hatched the hen has laid several eggs.

But the most remarkable features of this nestling are to be
found in the feet, and the beak.
As to the feet. These are peculiar inasmuch as all the
toes except the hallux are turned forwards, whereas in the adult
of course the first (hallux) and fourth toes are directed back-
wards. In other words, this nestling is not zygodactylous. I
would suggest that those who are interested in the breeding of
Parrots should examine very young living nestlings to see
whether this generally obtains among Parrots at this stage.
The beak agrees in all its essential characters with that
which I described in the Psephotus multicolor. And for purposes
of comparison is here figured together with that of an adult, and
that of the young Calopsittacus.
In this last named, as may be seen by a reference to the
figures, the abrupt angle which the premaxillary forms with the
maxillary portion of the jaw, is extremely well marked. The
lower is also wider than the upper jaw, and its cutting edge is also
membranous, this being especially noticeable at the gape where
the free edge of the lower overlaps that of the upper jaw, though
not in as marked a manner as in Psephotus.
It is by no means easy to describe these several peculi-
arities of the jaws so as to convey an accurate impression of the
actual conditions, but the illustrations given may help towards
this end. The change in the form of the beak which takes place
during the passage from the nestling to the adult stage is
certainly striking.
In the adult Calopsittacus (Cockatiel) it will be noticed
that if a line be drawn vertically, from the anterior margin of
the cere downwards, it will cut through the middle of the lower
jaw ; in the nestling such a line passes in front of the jaw.
Again, in the adult the tomium or cutting edge of the upper jaw
is &amp;quot; festooned &amp;quot; and the jaw terminates in a sharp point. In the
nestling the tomium of the upper jaw is straight as far as the
level of the anterior end of the mandible, when its free edge
turns sharply downwards to form the margin of a great &amp;quot;scoop.&amp;quot;
In the mandible or lower jaw, no less striking differences be-
tween adult and nestling are observable. In the first place, the
tomium of the mandible in the former is sinuous, in the latter

hollow : while the inferior border of the jaw in the adult is
semicircular, in the nestling straight, until near the tip.
The fact that the external nostrils open at a point above
the angle of the gape in the adult, and much in advance of this in
the nestling, suggests considerable differences in the relative
rates of growth of the several parts of the jaws between the
nestling and adult stages. Observations on this point are
evidently much needed. As to the significance of these changes
nothing can profitably be said at this juncture. But it would
seem that the curious spoon-shaped tip of the upper jaw of the
nestling may represent a stage in the ancestral history, when the
jaws were used for softer food.

By D. Seth-Smith, M.B.O.U.
In the Avicultural Magazine for August 1905 I described
the rearing in my aviary of young of the Australian Varied
Hemipode or Bustard Quail, Ttirnix varia.
It will be remembered that in this interesting group of
birds the female is larger and more brightly coloured than the
male. She does the courting and he hatches and rears the young.
The pair that bred so successfully in 1905 made no attempt to
repeat the process in the following year, though the female
frequently displayed to her mate. This year, however, they
seemed inclined to nest. A nest was made of hay in a corner of
the inner part of the aviary in May. Three eggs were laid and
the male duly incubated them, but to no purpose; they were
unfertile. Soon after I bad removed the eggs another clutch of
three was laid, but the male declined to repeat the process
of incubation. Seeing that he refused to sit I took the eggs and
placed them in an incubator with very little hope of their hatch-
ing, as the last clutch were all clear. However on the fourteenth
day (June 26th) a lively and vigorous chick made its appearance
and I noticed a second egg was chipped. This I left until the
following morning when, finding the young bird still unable to
leave the shell, I gently helped it out. It seemed very weak, but
soon became as strong as the other.
The question that now presented itself was as to how the
5&apos;oung were to be reared ? They were put in a small run with their
father who ought to have brooded them, but he refused to have
anything to do with them. I determined therefore to attempt to
hand-feed them, knowing full well that I was letting myselfin
for a difficult and tedious task.

The young birds of this species when first hatched are less
than two inches in length, they absolutely refuse to pick up any
food from the ground, taking everything from the bill of their
parent, and will only eat living insects.
The two babies were put into the drying box of the incu-
bator, and every half hour, from five o&apos;clock in the morning
until dusk, they were taken out and fed with a pair of tweezers
on living ants&apos; cocoons, small gentles, or any small grubs that
could be obtained. When first taken out of the warm chamber
and put into a box in which I fed them they would rush at one

another and peck vigorously at each other&apos;s beak, showing the
inborn instinct to look to the beak for food. My wife kindly
took charge when I was away, and had it not been for her help
the chicks could not have lived for many days.
When seven days old the quill feathers were well developed
in their sheathes, and then a trying time arrived, the drying box
of the incubator was too warm for them and they began to flag.
One had a fainting fit in my hand as I took it out to feed on the
eighth day, but it soon recovered and took a hearty meal.
On the ninth day the chicks were transferred to a Tamlin&apos;s
foster-mother which was put out on the lawn, and the day being
sunny and warm (almost the first sunny day we had had since

they were hatched) they spent most of their time in the run
sunning themselves. They now commenced to pick up food for
themselves, and our chief troubles were ended. They grew
rapidly, feeding on fresh ants&apos; cocoons and gentles almost ex-
clusively ; soft food and small seeds were supplied but hardly
touched. When the sun shone they basked in it, but when the
weather was cold and dull they retired into the warm foster-
mother. By the twelfth day they were practically feathered with
the exception of their heads which still retained the down, and
when fifteen days old (July nth) they were transferred to a
sheltered run in the aviary. I left home on this date, and on my
return a week later the chicks had grown well. Their heads,
which feather last of all, are now covered with quill feathers and
the birds are nearly as large as the adult male. One shows very
distinctly the reddish nuchal collar of the adult female, and is
doubtless of that sex.
I think they may now (July 21st) be considered completely
reared.

Danaine butterflies readily enough in the absence of others, but
when offered a choice showed their dislike of these &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot;
forms by avoiding them. This avoidance was much more marked
when the birds were at liberty, though even so a few of the
objectionable butterflies were eaten. Delias eucharis and Papilio
aristolockitz were also disliked by this bird, more especially the
latter.
Although I did not experiment on any of them at liberty,

macrura) was similar, in that all of these birds objected to the
Danai?ice, Delias eucharis, * and Papilio aristolochics, (especially,
as a rule, to the last) in comparison with other butterflies, or
absolutely.
I never saw the Chloropsis (Chloropsis aurifrons or viala-
baricd) or the Sibia (Malarias capislrala) eat any &amp;quot;nauseous&amp;quot;
butterfly, except that in the case of the former, one Euploza body
and a few bits of wing were eaten.
The latter bird refused with apparent dislike the male of
Elymnias undularis, which should be palatable, and was as a
matter of fact usually liked by the birds to which I offered it,
Another mimetic species, Papilio polites, was not very generally
popular with birds, but much preferred to its model,/*, aristolochics.
The Hornbill refused Danaince and Papilio aristolochice
absolutely, but ate the only Delias eucharis given.
In several cases I saw the birds apparently deceived b} r
mimicking butterflies. The Common Babbler was deceived by
Nepheronia hippia and Ljothrix by Hypolinmas viisippus. The
latter bird saw through the disguise of the mimetic Papilio
polites, which, however, was sufficient to deceive the Bhimraj and
King-crow.
I doubt if any bird was impressed by the mimetic appear-
ance of the female Elymnias undularis. But this is not a firsts
rate imitation, and a mimic is put to a very severe test when
offered to a bird in a cage or aviary.
Young hand-reared birds, like the Shama and Bhimraj,
had no instinctive knowledge of the &amp;quot; nauseous&amp;quot; forms, and ate
them quite readily at first, but soon gained experience. Birds
caught when old, when watched from the first, like the Sibia,
first Mesia and Starling, appeared to know and avoid the un-
palatable species. The latter bird&apos;s action in greedily devouring
the first whole Papilio aristolochicz given, and then avoiding this
species, seems to show that it did not know this insect, and had
no general prejudice against Warning Colours.
So far the results of these experiments on the whole bear
out the accepted theory, but certain birds, like the Lizards, were
more indiscriminate in their tastes.
* The first Mesia had not this species offered to it, but those subsequently kept had, and
evidently disliked it.

on the Relations of Indian Insectivorous Birds to Butterflies. 307
The two Red- vented species of Bulbuls (Molpasles benga-
le?isis and Otocompsa emeria) when they would eat butterflies at
all (some were very reluctant to do this) showed little discrimi-
nation, and often devoured the DaniancB as readily as other kinds.
The contrast in this respect between these birds and Liothrix,
when kept under the same conditions, was very noticeable.
The Yellow-vented species (Molpasles leucotis) though the
only bird by which I saw Acraea eaten, was rather more dis-
criminating on the whole towards the Daniance, and all three
agreed in objecting, as a general rule, to Delias eztcharis and
Papilio aristolochice.
The Button-Qnail (Turnix taigoor) was also very ready to
eat the Dafiainse, and objected to the other two protected forms
above specified. But I do not consider the tastes of this little
ground-bird of any importance, and in fact did not keep it for
experiment.
The Bulbuls offer a more serious difficulty, as they are very
common birds, and undoubtedly do eat butterflies in a wild state.
I have myself seen a wild individual of one of the Red-vented
forms eat a white butterfly. Experiments should be made, by
those who have the opportunity, with wild Bulbuls getting their
own food.
Mynahs (Acridolheres tristis) in a few experiments made,
cared little for butterflies, or showed no great discrimination
when taking them, though at liberty.
Though most birds which are at all insectivorous with
which I experimented, captive or wild, showed more or less desire
for butterflies, some would not eat them at all, Crows {Corvus
splende?is) for instance.
I conclude from these experiments :
1. That there is a general appetite for butterflies among insec-
tivorous birds, even though they are rarely seen when
wild to attack them.
2. That many — probably most species — dislike, if not intensely,
at any rate in comparison with other butterflies, the
&amp;quot; warningly-coloured&amp;quot; DanaincB, Acrcea violce, Delias
eucharis, and Papilio aristolochi&amp;lt;z ; of these the last beings
the most distasteful, and the Danaince the least so.

3. That the mimics of these are at any rate relatively palatable,
and that the mimicry is commonly effectual under
natural conditions.
4. That each bird has to separately acquire its experience, and
well remembers what it has learned.

That therefore on the whole, the theory of Wallace and
Bates is supported by the facts detailed in this and my former
papers, so far as they deal with birds (and with the one Mammal
used). Professor Poulton&apos;s suggestion that animals may be
forced by hunger to eat unpalatable forms is also more than
confirmed, as the unpalatable forms were commonly eaten with-
out the stimulus of actual hunger ; generally also, I may add,
without signs of dislike.
To future experimenters I would offer the following hints
derived from my experiences as detailed in this series of papers.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.8883757">
1. Use animals at liberty for experimenting with if possible.
2. If these are not available, confine your subjects singly, and
feed them well and naturally, letting them be neither
hungry nor pampered. Cages should be of portable
size (about two feet every way) and made (for birds) of
half-inch mesh wire netting with plain wooden floor
without a tray. This is to prevent insects getting out or
being concealed.
3. Use wild-caught specimens in preference to hand-reared ones.
4. Remember that the best and often the only way to determine

The second number of British Birds contains, as a frontispiece, an
excellent photogravure portrait of the late Professor Newton and a memoir

Mr. P. H. Bahr continues his interesting account of the home life of
the Osprey as observed by him in America. The claim of the British
Willow Tit to be recognised as a distinct species is defended by the Hon.
Walter Rothschild. Mr. Selous continues his account of the nesting habits

It is a good thing for the male to give the lead, and to
take the direction of affairs into his own hands. Where there is
weakness, shilly-shallying, and uncertainty, there the results
will be correspondingly feeble, or wholly negative.
During a good part of June and July of this year, a pair
of Cuba Finches, Phonipara canora, were nest - building about
the aviary, now in one part, now in another; but nothing came
of their toil and labour. Recently they commenced to build in
the front of the aviary, where their proceedings could be
watched. Both birds were busy, both energetic : the place
selected, the inside of a log, was well sheltered, and seemed
suitable in every respect. For these little Cubans, unlike many
species, no matter how luxuriant the growth of the shrubs
and bushes may be, will usually choose some artificial box in
preference to a natural site ; and, moreover, they seem to pre-
fer a good large place, often fixed up high, into which they will
carry a mass of material, the nest proper being far back at the
top of the heap, the upper part of the box being accepted as the
dome — for these birds build covered nests.
It was not until after the lapse of some days that I took in
what was actually going on in this particular case. Both of the
Cubas were carrying to the same high corner, both were evi-
dently very much in earnest — but they zvere carrying to different
receptacles : the male was building his nest in the log I have
mentioned, the female hers in a box behind the log. Quietly
and steadily the male worked away ; the female, on the contrary,
after carrying up a piece, would dart viciously and hysterically
at the male. Time after time this would be repeated. What
annoyed and upset her most was the methodical and apparently
indifferent manner in which the male went about his business.
Let her kick and squeal as she liked, without retaliating, and
with supreme indifference, he pursued the even tenor of his way.
The results so far, needless to say, have been nil.
Perhaps there are others besides Cuba Finches who
might with advantage take a hint from the wise saying Of-iie_-
ancient herdsman of Tekoa. But if agreement cannot be arrived

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
ON MR. HUBERT ASTLEY AND SOME ASPECTS OF
AVICULTURE.
Sir, — A couple of years ago I was told upon the highest possible
authority that the Lories in the Zoological Gardens should be fed on a
different diet from that in use ; but since the information was accompanied
by the naive and candid admission that the birds appeared to be in perfect
health, the value of the friendly advice was diminished to vanishing point.
And although the opinion of the incorrectness of the Society&apos;s method was
the result of long experience with Lories, the adhesion to that method has-
been fully justified by the health and longevity of our birds.
Again, only last week a message was sent to me from one aviculturist
through another — both personal friends and men of repute whose names
wild horses shall not drag from me — to the effect that if a particular kind
of Starling was fed on the food he was having that morning, the span of his
life might be measured in days. If my kindly adviser had known that the
bird in question has looked neither sick nor sorry 011 those daily rations
since he came to the Gardens about a year ago and is apparently in
excellent condition at the present moment, his reported prophecy would
have been less positive and more hopeful. Now this bird belongs to a
species which, so far as I am aware, has never been imported before. Hence
my friend&apos;s opinion was not based upon practical experience, but was
inferentially drawn from bibliographical acquaintance with the species. I
am not now concerned with the justice of the inference ; I merely tell the
story — a sample of many I could recount — to illustrate the truth that it is
impossible to know without a wealth of experience exactly what conditions
will suit a given animal or bird in captivit}-.
That there is more than one way of feeding Hoopoes has been shown
by the letters recently published in this magazine on the subject ; and in
confirmation of what Mr. Phillipps says about the necessity of warmth for
these birds, I may add, parenthetically, that a few years ago our efforts to
keep them in our Western Aviary failed. In the Insect House, on the
contrary, where the air is always moist and the temperature high, they have
lived all the } r ear round in good health.
These preliminary remarks on the limitations of avicultural know-
ledge and the wisdom of caution in criticism bring me to Mr. Astley&apos;s
paper entitled Fresh Air for Cage Birds in the last issue of our magazine.
The writer indulges in one or two gibes, which are perhaps intended to be
funny and not unfriendly, but are wholly inexcusable withal, against the
Zoological Society for exhibiting Sugar Birds in cages with glass fronts and
backs and perforated zinc sides. I say inexcusable because these birds and
others, despite adverse preconceptions, did on the whole very well wheiLSQ-
caged ; and to crown it all made an uncommonly pretty show, a point which

<bodyText confidence="0.997926681818182" page_id="33229344"  page_num="312" year="" vol="">
the Society is obliged to consider. This obligation on our part to combine
exhibition with preservation is too often lost sight of by thoughtless critics
who are wearying in their repetition of the patent absurdity that the
vSociety, handicapped in that and other ways, ought to be able to keep birds
and animals better than private owners who have a perfectly free hand and
nothing to consider but the welfare of their species. Glass cages may not
appeal to Mr. Astley&apos;s aesthetic side; that is a quite unimportant detail.
When, however, he proceeds to assert dogmatically that the lives of birds
are shortened by that method of exhibition, he puts himself in the position
in which it is necessary to remind him that he is stating as a fact what is at best
an opinion, and an opinion worth very little attention, because it is founded
on assumptions of the flimsiest kind. How in the world can he or any-
one else know that some birds that died in similar cages would have
survived if differently accommodated ? Other birds of the same and of
different kinds lived in them for months in perfect health ; and for any
thing Mr. Astley can know to the contrary the days of those that died may
have been lengthened by the method of keeping them. If one Cockatoo
dies in the Parrots&apos; House and another in the Parrots&apos; Aviary in the Gardens,
there are people who can see nothing illogical in concluding that the first
would have lived in the aviary and the second in the house; and the
inference is just as defensible as the inference regarding the Sugar Birds
put forward by Mr. Astley as a logicall}&apos; domesticated conclusion.
No one will be surprised to hear that Mr. Astley&apos;s Sugar Birds thrive
in his bird-room with open windows or even on the balcony. One of ours
lived a long time in our Parrot House and others have done so in the Insect
House. They also appear to thrive in the New Birds&apos; House. Personally I
think they would do splendidly in the Western Aviary, if they proved them-
selves capable of competing with larger birds. All this merely goes to
show that these birds are hardy in the sense of having considerable power
of environmental adaptation in captivity. This is a conclusion of practical
value and interest to aviculturists ; and this Mr. Astley would probably have
seen had he been less intent on proclaiming the superiority of his own
methods over those practised in the Zoological Gardens.
I fear Mr. Astley also needs reminding that air may be hot or moist or
odorous, or all three combined, and } T et be fresh in the sense of having its
proper percentage of ox3&apos;geu. That the air of the Insect House, despite its
alleged &amp;quot;stuffiness,&amp;quot; is not serious^ lacking in that vital essential is proved
by the success with which the Hoopoes, Paradise Birds, and other species
have been kept in it. True we lost two King Birds, and one of them within
the twelve-month ; but he died in faultless condition of feather and flesh.
The second lived about two years and a quarter and died in moult, emaciated.
Will any body be foolish&apos; enough to say that the cause of the death in either
case, or both, was persistent or temporary vitiation of the atmosphere ?
The birds might have done better or thev might have done worse elsewhere.

Who can say ? As for the Greater and Lesser Birds of Paradise, the
verdict as to the suitability of this so-called &amp;quot; stuffy &amp;quot; house for these
specimens may be quite safely left in the hands of all aviculturists who
have seen them. Nevertheless they ate shaping as if they would thrive in
their new quarters in the Small Birds&apos; House ; and I believe they would
do as well in the Western Aviary as they did in the Insect House.
Certainly they could hardly do better. However that may be Mr. Astley&apos;s
condemnation of the Insect House as a place where the lives of birds are
shortened may be politely dismissed as a judgment thoughtlessly formed
and recklessly expressed without reference to facts.
To think there is only one way and that one&apos;s own way of doing things
and to wrangle or remonstrate with those who follow a different course is
intensely human and is apparently almost as rampant now as it was in
Neolithic times. But older than the Neolithic age is the little realised
truth of the moral metaphorically expressed in the last two of the following
four lines : —
Here&apos;s my wisdom for your use, as I learnt it when the moose
And the reindeer roared where Paris roars to-night : —
There are nine and sixty wavs of constructing tribal lays,
And — every — single — one — of— them — is — right.

We have received from Professor Giacinto Martorelli, of Milan, a
copy of a very interesting contribution of his to the &amp;quot;Societa Italiana di
Scienze Naturali,&amp;quot; on some new appearances in Italy of certain Siberian
and American migratory birds, and on the influence of the rotatory motion
of the earth on the general direction of migration.
After referring to his previous investigations on the subject of
migrator}&apos; birds, especially with respect to the Thrushes and to his theorv
that the direction of their migration has to do with the rotator}&apos; movements
of the earth and the great aerial currents which are produced, the Professor
in this paper turns his attention to migratory Geese and gives very interest-
ing details and measurements of three specimens that came under his notice
in 1906, and which he identifies as belonging to Branta nigricans (The Black
Brent Goose) a form which occurs in Western Arctic America and N. E.
Siberia. He then passes on to consider the geographical area of each of
the three forms into which the original species (Branta bernicla) is now
divided and summarises all the information we have of these birds.
Passing from the Branta specimens he dilates upon another great
migratory binh the North American Great Northern Shrike (Lanius
borealis) a bird which has not previously been recorded in Italy.
His general concluding considerations are very interesting as showiiig-
the bearing of the air currents in determining the deviation from N. to S.

into N.E. to S.W., which can be observed on the great migrations, the
birds moving in one direction in the spring and reversing it in the autumn.
In a final note the Professor alludes to four other specimens of the
Black Brent, which have just come under his notice and which were also
procured in Italy; the time when these four birds had been obtained
corresponded with that of a very abundant appearance of all sorts of
water fowl.

By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
I fear I have not time to say much on these pretty ducks,
which are not very familiar in aviculture, with the exception of
our two well-known British species, the Teal and the Garganey.
Many are, I think, rather too small to be fairly left at large un-
pinioued, and are better allowed free use of their wings in a large
aviary, where they will fly round in the evening and look very
ornamental. A place like the Waders&apos; Aviary at the Zoo. would
suit them well, — I am glad to see they have a pair there now —
but they will thrive at a pinch with a much smaller pond.
I here append a list of the species I have seen in captivity
with brief descriptions and some notes.
The Common Teal.
(Nettium crecca).
This is the smallest kind kept ; it is only about as big as a
common Pigeon. The duck is almost an exact miniature of the
common wild duck, except that the bill and feet are dark, not
orange at all, and the bar on the wing is bright metallic green.
The drake is pencilled grey, with a spotted breast, brown head
with a green streak on each side, and cream and black markings
down the back and on the lower tail coverts. In summer he
goes into a dress much like the duck&apos;s, but is less distinctly
marked.
The Japanese Teal.
(Nettiwn formosuni).
It is not necessary for me to describe this very handsome&amp;quot;

bird, as it has been done recently. I may, however, mention a
curious variation I have observed in the colouration of the feet
in different specimens : in some they are grey — the normal colour
apparently — in others olive. Differences of this kind are very
rare in birds, but I have seen a similar case in the small Indian
Hemipode (Tumix dussumieri) in which some specimens have
blue-grey and others fleshy-white feet.
The Brazilian Teal.
(Nettium brasiliense).
This bird has brown plumage and a spotted breast ; the
wings are mostly of a beautiful metallic green. The feet are
rosy red, and the drake has also a red bill, that of the duck being
black. There is not much sex- difference in plumage, and I
believe there is no seasonal change, but am not sure of this.
The Andaman Teal.
(Nettium albigulare).
This is a sombrely-coloured Teal, chocolate with narrow
buff edgings to the feathers. Except in young birds, there is a
white patch surrounding the eye, which white tends to spread all
over the face, and even to appear on the back of the neck. This
is a variation which has become much more common of recent
years — a curious case of evolution actually in progress. The
wing bar in this Teal is a velvety-black with a bronze streak
through it, and there is also a large white patch on the wing.
The Andaman Teal is about the most active duck I ever saw : it
is constantly on the move, running briskly and easily, swims and
dives well, flies lightly, and perches freely. Unlike most perch-
ing ducks, however, it nests on the ground. It bred in the Zoo.
last year, and I observed the drake accompanied the brood as
well as the duck.
The Chilian Teal.
(Nettium flavirostre).
This Teal closely resembles the Chilian Pintail in colour-
ation, being a plain mottled-brown duck, with a bill yellow at
the base and bluish at the tip, with a central black streak. Its

Notes on Teal. 317
much smaller size and shorter and straighter bill will, however,
distinguish it at once. It is not common, but there is a specimen
at the Zoo. at present.
The Garganey Teal.
(Que?&apos;qued7da circia).
The Garganey is probably more familiar in captivity than
at large, being a local bird in England where, unlike other ducks,
it is a summer visitor. Yet it bears our winter as well as other
ducks in captivity. In Bengal, at all events, it seems to be the
commonest of the migrant ducks from the north. The drake is
easily recognisable by his speckled-brown head with broad white
eyebrows ; his body is beautifully pencilled on the sides, the
tail-end being mottled brown ; and the wing-coverts are lavender-
grey. The duck is almost exactly like the female common Teal,
but has not the bright green wing-bar. The drake in undress
plumage, which in this species is in actual fact a winter plumage,
is very like the duck, but his lavender wing-coverts distinguish
him. Pallid or &amp;quot;cinnamon&amp;quot; varieties of the Garganey seem to
be not uncommon in India, where I have seen several. They
have flesh-coloured bills and feet, instead of dark gre3&apos;, but the
•eyes in those I have seen alive are not pink, but normally
coloured.
The Grey Teal. (See coloured plate J .
{Querqziedula versicolor.)
&amp;quot; Grey &amp;quot; is hardly a fair descriptive title to apply to this
handsomely coloured South American species, which is so
variously marked that it is hard to describe in a few. words.
It may, however, be readily recognised by the colouring of the
head, which is black on the crown and buff on the cheeks. The
breast is spotted, and the body beautifully pencilled, producing a
grey effect. The sexes are almost indistinguishable, so that here,
as in the Chilian Wigeon, we have another case of a South Ameri-
can species, both sexes of which bear a quasi-male plumage.
As in that bird, also, there is no seasonal change in the present
one.

Turtur semitorquatus.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
This handsome bird is the largest of all the Turtle-Doves,
though the Eastern Turtle {Turtur orientalis) may approach it in
size, and the Double-collared Turtle {Ttirhir bitorquatus) surpass
it in length, it is nevertheless a much more bulky bird than
either of them.
It also probably has the widest range of any Turtle-Dove,
as it is found in suitable localities all over Africa from about 14
N, lat-. Southwards.
Briefly it may be described as a bird with the whole upper
surface of the body dark brown, the outer wing-coverts passing
into bluish slate colour, two central tail feathers dark brown, the
lateral ones brown grey with a blackish band about the middle,
and pale grey towards the tips ; there is 110 white on the outer
edges of the outermost tail feathers ; the under tail-coverts,
leaden-grey ; the breast, back of head and cheeks, deep vinous
pink ; the crown, grey, lighter towards the forehead ; and a broad
black collar more or less bordered with grey on the hind neck ;
iris seems to range from orange red to salmon pink ; bill, black,
a little dark red at the gape ; feet, carmine ; broad bare skin
round the eye, dark purple carmine, hence the usual name in S.
Africa for this bird of Red-eyed Turtle-Dove, which however
may lead to confusion with Turtur decipiens ambiguus, Bocage&apos;s
Red- eyed Dove.
Though this bird must have been familiar to thousands ot
travellers, not very much about its wild life seems to have been
recorded ; the following accounts are among the more recent.
Reichenow, in the first volume of his great work, &amp;quot; Die Vogel
Afrikas,&amp;quot; writes: &amp;quot; These large doves are very noticeable through
the dark colouring of the upper surface, inhabit the fields by
Tabora (German East Africa), especially at the beginning of the
maize and mtama harvest. They usually nest 011 the parched
trees which are scattered about everywhere. Their muffled
&apos; huhu huhu huahud &apos; in which the last note is the loudest and
highest, resounds also from the thick foliage of the forest edge.
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.997546256410257" page_id="33229357"  page_num="319" year="" vol="">
on the Half- Collared Turtle Dove. 319
They do not penetrate the inner parts of the forest. The usual
call is now and then broken by a soft &apos; turr-ruck &apos; when in a
more passionate humour, especially on alighting, or when one
jostles an already alighted companion. The humorous trans-
lation of the Wass Waleli of the principal call runs when
complete, &amp;quot; Kuku mtupa tupu mimi mama tupu,&amp;quot; that is &amp;quot;The
hen has nothing but bones, I only flesh.&amp;quot; Pairing takes place
in the middle of May. The male dove shows himself very
attentive to the female. Cooing and puffing out his crop he
bows down before her, while the female responding (schuarreud)
loudly and followed by her admirer hops coyly from branch to
branch, at times also leaving the tree, but returning after a short
flight, to be received with redoubled cooing and bowing. After
the nesting season the birds often assemble in large flocks,
which wander about together. Their food consists of grass-
seeds and berries. The call consists of two long and four short
notes.&amp;quot;
Mr. W. L. Sclater writing in &amp;quot; The Birds of S. Africa,&amp;quot;
Vol. IV. says: &amp;quot; The Red-eyed Dove is not very common in S.
Africa, except in more thickly-wooded districts from Swellen-
dam eastwards ; it is found along the South coast of the Colony
and extends to Natal, Mashoualand and the Zambesi, but does
not appear to have been yet noticed in the Transvaal. Beyond
our limits it is spread over the greater part of Africa as far as
Abyssinia and Senegal.&amp;quot; He also quotes from Messrs. R. B. and
J. D. S. Woodwards&apos; &amp;quot; Natal Birds,&amp;quot; p. 131 : &amp;quot;This dove is very
common throughout the country, and its loud pleasant cooing is
heard wherever there is any cover for them, during the warmer
months of the year. They are sometimes seen in large flocks,
but as a rule they go about in pairs, and feed principally on tree
berries. The natives have no love for these birds as they devour
a considerable quantity of grain during the planting season ; but
there would not be much loss if care were taken to plant the
seeds deeper. They get very fat during the summer, and are
excellent eating. This dove laj&apos;S its eggs on a few sticks, which
are merely an apology for a nest, generally in a low tree.&amp;quot;
From the above it is evident that the Half-collared Dove_

edges of clearings or where there is open waste land in the
neighbourhood of trees, that it feeds on wild fruits, such as figs
and berries, but like most of its congeners, does not fail to take
toll of grain crops when opportunity affords ; and that it lives in
pairs during the nesting season, but unites in flocks afterwards.
Three fine specimens came into my possession on the 4th&apos;
April 1906, consisting of a pair and an odd hen. The pair came
with the reputation of nesting too fast, and so neglecting the
young of the previous nest. I am glad to say they have not
done this since. I cannot say that I can see any appreciable
difference in the size of the sexes, though individuals differ in
this respect, but the cocks seem to be a good deal more ashy on
the crown, the hens being more slatey there.
They seem rather wild by nature and to want a lot of
space, as they dash about in a very lumbering way when alarmed.
I have found them very peaceable birds for Turtle - Doves,
seldom fighting and allowing birds very much smaller than
themselves to live with them without interference. At first my
birds showed no signs of nesting, but were kept in fear and
trembling by a rather fierce Deceptive Dove : he was removed,
and within a week the first egg made its appearance. Every
single nest has been made ever since in the same zinc bowl,*
which is about seven feet from the ground on a bundle of faggots
close to the glass roof of the open shelter which protects the
inner house of the aviary they are in. The eggs, as I have
invariably found to be the case with all doves, are laid the first
one towards the evening, then a day is missed and the second
egg appears on the following morning.
The eggs are white and rather coarse-grained, and are
remarkably small for the size of the bird. I have ten examples
before me, laid by three hens : they vary a good deal in size, but
are all rounded, in some it is hard to say which is the smaller
end. I have some eggs laid by Common Turtle x Barbary and
Necklace X Barbary hybrids, birds much smaller than the Half-
collared Doves, which are distinctly larger than any of these.
This may be accounted for by what I consider the most extra-

ordinary circumstance connected with the nidification of this
bird. It must be borne in mind that this is a large bird almost
equalling in size the smaller breeds of the domestic pigeon,
and yet I find the eggs sometimes hatch in twelve days. I
have the exact records of six young ones, which, counting from
the laying of the second egg when incubation may be said to
begin, are as follows : One in twelve days ; three in thirteen
days, but one of these probably hatched in twelve days as it was
some hours old, with food in crop, when discovered on the thir-
teenth day ; and two in fourteen days. Both these last were
however under other birds, which is not quite the same as the
natural parents, so I think incubation may be said to be from
twelve to thirteen days. I have no personal record of any other
species of Turtle-Doves&apos; eggs hatching in twelve days.
The following is a description of the young at one day
old : Body, head and neck well covered with longish yellow buff
down, longest on the under surface of neck and crop region ;
bare face and base of bill purplish ; chin dark flesh-colour ; bill
grey with reddish tinge, dark purple grey band at end, extreme
tip pale flesh-colour ; legs and feet livid flesh ; claws bright
pink. I was also struck with the rapidity with which the
young mature. I kept some notes on the first pair of young,
hatched on the 17th and 18th of June 1906. The bird hatched
on the 17th was given to a cock Necklace and hybrid Necklace
x Barbary hen to bring up, the other bird was reared by its
parents. On the 2nd July the bird hatched on the 17th June,
being fifteen days old, first left the nest and flew down
quite lightly, though rather unsteadily; it was replaced in the
nest. The next day it again flew down, and seemed to be able
to fly quite well, as it flew from floor to perch (about four feet
from the ground) several times, flying backwards and forwards
(about ten feet) quite well, roosted at night on a branch about
seven feet from the ground. On going into the aviary on
the morning of the 4th the young bird was on a branch about
eight feet from the ground ; it flew through the open door into
the flight for about twenty feet, alighting in a bush. The follow-
ing day it was flying strongly about the bushes in the flight,
and on being frightened, it flew into the inner house on to a

branch quite eight feet from the ground. On this day the second
young one (hatched on the 18th June) flew. It seemed quite as
strong on the wing as the other one, for a day or two it had been
sitting on edge of nest. The young birds were now about the
size of full-grown Barbary Doves ; they were well feathered,
though showing a little bare skin under the wings, which were
very rounded looking, owing to the outer primaries not being so
well developed as the rest ; tail about two inches long ; iris just
beginning to turn colour from the brown of the early stage ; skin
round the eye grey; feet dark grey with faint tinge of purple ;
bill dark grey with slight purple tinge, most of the smaller
feathers retaining yellow nest down at end of feathers, especially
on breast, very noticeable on back and upper tail-coverts, very
little on head ; the young appeared unusually well furnished with
yellow down when hatched. July 6th, first young one flying
about as strongly as an old bird, very wild, went to roost beside
its foster parents on high branch ; the other young did not leave
neighbourhood of nest to which it had returned of its own accord.
24th July, the birds being between five and six weeks old, both
beginning to moult, grey feathers coming on top of head, also
vinous ones on back of head and breast ; feathers nearly full grown
round base of bill ; grey skin round eye beginning to turn purple ;
iris a narrow ring of dull orange. The bird hatched on the 18th
of June was now considerably the larger and more advanced bird,
but showed no black collar on hind neck, which was however
showing quite distinctly in the one hatched on the 17th.
Here I may compare these birds reared during the present
3 r ear. The young bird in first feather differs very markedly
from the adult, the entire head and breast are of a warm chest-
nut shade ; the former showing no trace of the handsome grey
crown, nor the latter a vestige of the beautiful vinous pink of the
adult ; the feathers of the upper surface are edged with chestnut,
though some young birds are more uniformly coloured than
others, the primaries are edged with very conspicuous broad
chestnut tips and the black collar is absent. Beginning with the
youngest, which is just five weeks old, it is still entirely in nest
plumage, though it shows signs of just being on the point of
commencing to moult. The skin round the eye is grey with a

strong purple tinge, iris with a narrow ring of dull orange. The
feathers have not grown round the base of the bill yet. The
outer primaries are full grown but retain vestiges of their sheaths
at their base. The next one is just over ten weeks old. Nearly
all the smaller feathers have been renewed, and a few black
feathers of the collar are appearing on each side of the neck,
two primaries in each wing have been moulted and replaced by
full grown feathers ; skin round the eye bright carmine ; edges
of mandibles at gape carmine ; feet dark purple grey ; iris
narrow ring of pale orange. This is the biggest bird of the
three and was the only one reared by its own parents. The third
is just over fifteen weeks old, it has moulted all its smaller
feathers and has assumed the black collar, which is not however
so broad as in the adult. Nearly four primaries have been
renewed and several secondaries ; some tail feathers have also
been moulted, iris bright orange, skin round eye brighter red
than in the previous bird, and the feet are pink.
I have found the Half-collared Turtle wonderfully pro-
lific. My pair started nesting early in June 1906, and laid by the
end of November five pairs of eggs, from which six young were
reared, though not all by their parents. They started again in
January of this year and have so far laid seventeen eggs from which
the three above-mentioned young have been reared. As for
hardiness I need only mention that they were sitting in a
situation practically quite out in the open, except for a glass
roof, during the arctic spell we experienced in the beginning of
the year, bringing off a young bird, which however died the
following day. My birds are excellent sitters and bring up their
young ones splendidly. I have not yet had a weakly one, but
they are rather wild and will not stand interference: any unusual
occurrence in their compartment being sufficient to make them
desert their eggs. Young have been reared at least several times
before : my pair had bred before I had them.
The bird has several notes, each set being used for a par-
ticular purpose or purposes ; I find them very difficult to put
into words. When mated it is only the cock bird which is heard
to coo much, but an unmated hen is even more loquacious than— -
a cock and seems to be able to utter all his notes. All the

324 0?i the Half- Collared 7&amp;quot;urtle Dove.
Collared Turtles which I have so far kept (five species) have a
note which evidently corresponds to the well known laughing
note of the Barbary Dove, but in each species it is quite distinct.
This note in the Half-collared Turtle is a sort of whistled weehd
weehd, it is often uttered by the male on alighting on a perch or
before beginning to coo to the hen. This coo is a four-syllable
note, sounding something like 5o-5o-c5o-66, drawing up his head
and expanding his chest he makes a dignified but not very low
bow to the accompaniment of each set of notes, between each of
which a step or two is often taken towards the hen if she retires
before him. These notes are very deep and may almost be said
to be whispered into the hen&apos;s ear. I have often been unable to
hear them distinctly when only about twelve feet from the birds.
Much louder, however, is what may be called the call note
of the bird, which is often uttered when it is perched alone ; it is
a resounding cheerful Coo-ess cos cii-coo-cu, altered several times
but invariably ending with the coo-coo. The note used by the
cock to attract the hen, when he is sitting in the nest before the
eggs are laid sounds like this also, only it may then be continued
for a considerable time.
As is to be expected in a species having such a wide range
as the subject of these notes, specimens differ a little from
different localities. Erlanger in the J. f. O. 1905 has described
two races as differing from typical examples. The birds from
the high lying regions of S. Abyssinia, Gallaland, Equatorial, and
S. Africa are said to be smaller and darker brown on the upper
surface. The name of i7itermedius has been bestowed on this
form, while the birds from S. Somaliland are called minor from
their still smaller size and are distinguished by being greyer and
less vinous on nape and breast. Swainson&apos;s erythropkys does not
probably differ from typical birds.

(Avic. Mag. N. S. IV., p. 295.)
By Reginald Phillipps.
From casual words that reach me from time to time, it
seems that the Violet-eared Waxbill is still a prime favourite
with British aviculturists. In August, 1906, I wrote my own
experiences up to date of the species, and since have been waiting
with expectancy, month after month, for some other member
to come forward and complete the story. But in vain have
I waited ; and another year has rolled round ; and it seems
after all to fall to my own lot to have to fill up the blanks which
want of knowledge caused me to leave in my former account.
Besides, I should like to modify some of my earlier statements,
in order to bring them into accord with more recent observa-
tions ; and at the same time I may take the opportunity of
placing on paper such further thoughts as my four little friends
may have suggested to me during these latter months.
For it is of the same four Violets which were in my hands
last year that I am now again about to write, a fact that seems to
point to a bird which may be called a good liver ; but, as I
intimated before, it is not especially hardy, and it needs thought-
ful care — but not coddling.
The more robust and vigorous my Violet-eared Waxbills
become, the more- 1 find that it is impracticable to keep two of
the same sex together within a reasonable space*. As soon as
new arrivals become accustomed to their surroundings, and gain
a sufficiency of health and spirit to assert their individuality,
then the absolute necessity of separation becomes urgent in the
same ratio as the strength of the birds increases. To this point
of vital importance I may add a few supplementary notes.
I do not find the species to be very courageous ; birds of
equal and often of less size and strength will bully and drive
* I do not refer to birds in little cages; of these I have not had any experience.

them about, with two principal results: (i) If there be many
birds in the same aviary with them, they become cowed and will
not assert themselves, so that, if the place be large, even two
pairs may be kept together without very great danger ; but such
a state of things is not satisfactory, for it means that the true
uature of the bird is more or less suppressed and hidden.
(2) Although they may nest, it is unlikely that they will breed
successfully. But I do not say positively that they will not
breed successfully, for happily there is a reserve of stubbornness
and quiet obstinacy about the species which becomes developed
in connection with nesting if they be given anything like a
chance. The following will help to illustrate these points, and
will lead up to other matters.
Last year, owing to illness and laziness, I allowed all my
birds (the Burrowing Owls excepted), large and small, to fly to-
gether as they liked, the connecting holes between the two
aviaries, and between the aviaries and the birdroom, being left
open. This arrangement, or want of arrangement, as may be
supposed, spoilt most of the nesting ; more than once during
the summer my auger burned within me at the sight of aggressive
knaves wrecking a nest, and I caught the culprits and clipped
their wing-feathers ; but, for the most part, everything was left
to take its chance. After some preparatory shuffling, the two
pairs of Violet-eared Waxbills found themselves in contact.
Then came a period of chasing ; but, owing to the lengthy
space, the amount of covert, and especially to the division
of the place into three well defined sections and the good
condition of the weaker male, the strength of the pursuer
always failed before he could work mischief. For a time,
the weaker pair kept much to the bird-room, from which
they would make occasional sallies ; and, thanks to the
trees and the other birds, after a while they so far established
themselves along a narrow slip of the inner aviary as actually
to build two nests. One of these was built back to back
with a Blue - breasted Waxbills&apos;,* some 9 ft. off the ground. The
* This Blue-breasted Waxbills&apos; nest was a curiosity in its way. It was constructed
and occupied by two males, one of which assumed the role of a female, and sat steadily for
the best part of the summer, until, indeed, the &apos; male&apos;, who had found a way out of the
aviary and went backwards and forwards at will, finally disappeared. The &apos; female &apos; is still
with me, and is au undoubted male. They were both old birds without mates.— R. P.

strong male stood a little in awe of these Waxbills, and usually
gave their corner a wide berth. Did the weak one deliberately
seek the protection of the Blue Breasts? It is rather contrary to
the nature of the Violet-eared Waxbill to build at such a height,
for, if I may judge from my own birds, the &apos; four feet&apos; mentioned
by Stark (I., p. 105) is about the maximum ; the majority of the
nests built here have been between 3 ft. and 4 ft. from the ground.
Nevertheless the Violets are sensible birds, with a fine disregard
for red tape. The second nest constructed by the weaker male
and his mate was an independent and normal one, but they
never dared to occupy it.
More than once during the year I did, indeed, see all the
four Violets feeding and taking exercise together without
quarrelling ; but all through another point was confirmed. The
meetings of the one pair with the other were accidental, brought
about by the narrow confines of their little world. They never
associated together ; at the best, it was but an armed neutrality;
they kept as far apart as they well could ; otherwise than when
taking exercise — to which I will refer later — perhaps they never
met without a disturbance except when on some neutral ground :
for, after a while, each pair settled down to a particular district,
the boundary line between the two being generally respected. If
the weaker trespassed even for a moment, a fierce pursuit was
immediately set up. On the other hand, when the stronger
male crossed the border, the action clearly was regarded on both
sides as a raid and as a trespass ; and the raider, after a wild dash
hither and thither, would quickly withdraw within the limits
of his own domain. All the same, the shadow of the raider
oppressed the land, so that the second nest of the weaker male
was soon deserted.
This and everything I see and hear confirm my expressed
opinion (N. S. IV., 305-6) that the Violet-eared Waxbill does not,
in the wild state, go about in promiscuous flocks ; Dr. Edrnond
Symonds&apos; (p. 306) is the only statement to the contrary with
which I am acquainted.
Moreover, the available evidence, as far as it goes, tends
to point to a species that customarily pairs for life.
The male and female are very companionable and frietrdly^

328 Mr. R. Phiujpps,
are rarely seen far apart, and are greatly distressed if separated
but they are not of the kissing cuddling sort, and do not always,
even when at roost, sit so close as to touch one another.
Although two of these birds of the same sex, when pro-
perly established, may not be kept together with impunity, it is
satisfactory to be able to over-ride my statements of last year so
far as to say that at any rate a contented pair with plenty of
elbow-room, under ordinary circumstances, may be trusted not
to hurt those of other and distinct species. The following story
speaks for itself, and is worth recording.
Last year, a pair of Ringed Finches, Stictoptera anmdosa,
reared a brood in a thorn situated in the front of the inner aviary,
and took them off to the rear. On August 10, I noticed a large
nest, larger than that usually builded by the Ringed Finch and
more rotund, situated on one of the old sites in the thorn. The
Rings wanted to nest again after a while, and, as is their custom
if not disturbed, desired to come back to the old place. The}&apos;&apos;
were perpetually hovering and fluttering about the tree ; some
powerful attraction drew them thither, but some antagonistic
influence repelled and kept them aloof. It was not until some
days had elapsed that I detected that one of the Violets, now the
male, now the female, was always on guard, crouching down
immovable close to the nest. This was the first nest in the
garden — which, as I have stated, was given up last year to a
miscellaneous collection of birds — which this pair had fully con-
structed and attempted to defend. Occasionally the male would
make a dait at some bird approaching too near, but otherwise
everything was perfectly quiet.
But this nest was pulled to pieces by some miscreants (who
had their wings cut for their trouble), the Violets went off, and
the Rings returned and builded once more in the thorn. On
September 21, I found the Violets in possession of this nest,
which for some reason had been deserted by the Rings. On the
following day I found that the Rings, who had meanwhile built a
nest in an unsuitable position and had decided that it was too
unsuitable, wanted to come back to the one in the thorn. Find-
ing that the Violets would not turn out, after much ado, they
constructed a complete and independent nest at the back of the

on the Violet-eared Waxbill. 329
one in which the Violets now were sitting, the two nests being
back to back and attached the new to the old.* Occasionally,
when the Rings were unusually tiresome, I would see the male
Violet come slowly forth with bristles erect, like some faithful
coach-yard dog who approaches a doubtful stranger ; the Rings
would just flit off a yard or so, but in no instance were they
injured, or even pursued. I may finish this case off by adding
that the Violets sat most faithfully, through the cold and wet,
not relaxing their devotion to duty for a moment until October 7,
when, finding their labour hopeless, they closed the aperture
with a feather and went elsewhere. There were two clear eggs
in the nest, which I compared with those of like species in my
cabinet; but I had none which closely corresponded with them.
They were small elongated ovals, perhaps a hair-breadth shorter
than those of the Blue-breasted Waxbill but much less stout.
My birds have moulted only once during the last twelve
mouths, but the process occurred at different times with different
individuals, and extended altogether from November until the
beginning of May. It was more or less mixed up with their
early thoughts of nesting, and probably had much to do with
their erratic behaviour this summer, the breeding impulses,
usually strongest in the spring and in the autumn, of the males
and females not being always conterminous. It must be borne
in mind with this species that their natural summer occurs during
•our winter.
I have not been so well pleased with their singing this
year; they have rather displayed a disposition to bring in their
call-notes, and other cries, the result of contact with bad com-
panions.
The murder-call is psis or psit, uttered loudly and con-
tinuously as the would-be murderer pursues his vicious chase,
the female of the latter meanwhile maintaining a beautifully soft
and melodious warble — how often are the sweetest notes of the
birds misunderstood ! When a nest is approached, a very similar
note is uttered, but rather tit, and in a very much lower tone,
* Could this have been a case of imitation ? It is strange that there should have
been two such instances during- the same summer. The Kings eventually deserted&amp;quot;
nest and built elsewhere.— R. P.

330 Mr. R. Philupps,
and frequently in a semi-ventriloquial voice. A very similar
note again is uttered by the male when he seeks his missing
female. A common note, with modifications, is a sort of chisel,
often used as a note of warning of the presence of a stranger or
of any strange or dangerous object or creature ; it rather reminds
me of the notes of some of our Wagtails.
When the male wants to invite a reluctant female, he will
occasionally build a sort of platform some 3ft. -4ft. from the ground,
squatting on which he will warble forth some singularly soft and
sweet &apos;rolling&apos; notes, to the accompaniment of the various
movements of nest-building — the weaving, interlacing, con-
struction of the dome, &amp;c, &amp;c, often with a blade of grass in
his beak. This species, I am satisfied, customarily pairs inside
the nearly completed nest.
When in the garden, I notice how exceptionally keen the
Violet-eared Waxbill is in its search after aphides, examining
the foliage day by day most diligently. This in a general way,
but very specially when they have young, which seem to be fed
largely on tiny insect life. I have seen them go for centipedes
and even larger creatures, but only I think when aphides are
scarce. I never give them mealworms, but occasionally they will
take them.
The Violet-eared Waxbills, at certain seasons, usually only
in the rather early morning, fly backwards and forwards, day
after day, between the two farthest- apart points of the place in
which they are confined, keeping up the &apos;constitutional&apos; for
quite a long time, so strongly do they feel the need of a good
&apos;breather.&apos; While engaged in this exercise, feuds are forgotten,
and all fly backwards and forwards together, usually for a good
half-hour or more. In the six-foot cage during the winter, a
Violet will thus take exercise, a circumstance which points to the
superiority of the long over the high and the more cube-shaped
cages. Certain lofty cages in the New Birds&apos; House at the Zoo.
are not faultless in their construction in this respect, being high
but comparatively narrow and shallow ; for other captive species
besides Violet-eared Waxbills habitually will take exercise in a
precisely similar manner. A lofty aviary or aviary-cage is good,
but a lengthy one is very much better.

on the Violet- eared Waxbill. 331
During last winter, being short of accommodation for birds
which, could not be kept together, while carefully stowing away
separately my best pair of Violet-eared Waxbills in two six-foot
cages in my dining-room, I left the second pair to take their
chance in the birdroom, flying loose with a miscellaneous
collection. On most days, the window was left a little open for a
longer or shorter time according to the temperature, so as to
allow the inmates to take a fly in the open aviary should they
feel so disposed ; in this the Violets, differing from some species,
displayed an intelligent discrimination, when cold keeping snug
in the room, and, in any case, retiring early in the afternoon of
their own free will, but taking free exercise on every favourable
opportunity. The result has been that these latter birds, which
took the second place last year, have this summer been the most
powerful and the best, proving again, if any proof were needed,
the superiority of the aviary over the cage, even when the cage
is a six-footer.
In may be an important point to note that the pair which
did not lay and sit last year commenced early this year, whereas
the two birds that were sitting last September, although appar-
ently in faultless condition and placed in the thickly-wooded
aviary, had not done anything this summer up to the end of July.
The male selects the breeding site, in a thick bush from
preference, and does most of the carrying and building. The
female assists, but not very energetically. She shines most when
she sits in the nest and &apos;arranges the materials as they are
brought to her by her mate, but this is the exception rather than
the rule. The nest is domed, large, and roundish under ordinary
circumstances, very roomy inside, constructed of grasses and
thickly lined with feathers. Although dried grasses, hay, &amp;c,
will be used, yet the male seems by nature to prefer the green
growing grass, which he tugs up by the roots. He prefers rather
large feathers, with a natural curl or curve corresponding with
that of the arc of the inside of the nest.
The aperture, in the earlier nests, was moderately high up,
and consequently admitted rain. Then it was placed lower- —
down; and again, later, a substantial and unmistakable &apos;eye-
brow&apos; or eave was constructed across, above, and projecting over

the aperture. In No. 3 nest of this yesiv, an &apos;eye-brow&apos; was
deliberately added to the completed nest in the early morning
following a heavy storm — special work is usually carried out in
the early morning. The way in which these Waxbills adapt
their building to circumstances is sufficient of itself to prove not
only that birds, to quote Prof. Henslow (Avic. Mag. N.S. I., p.
218), &amp;quot; can build normal nests without parental instruction,&amp;quot; but
a great deal more : it shews that they can and do profit by
experiences and &apos; improve the occasion &apos; in a quite remarkable
way. This year, between March and July inclusive, my one pair
of Violets constructed four nests, all in different positions, and
all differing from one another ; to describe them in detail would
be instructive, but tedious to the general reader, so to the first
three I will refer but briefly.
This year the two aviaries have been kept distinct, and the
two pairs of Violet-eared Waxbills have been kept apart. The
inner aviary has abundance of natural vegetation, the outer being
comparatively bare. In the latter there are just a few dead trees ;
and one of them, a golden elder, eventually gave signs of life by
throwing out a bunch of shoots at the bottom and another, a
very feeble one at first, about 3ft. 9111. from the ground. In
March, when the birds commenced to build seriously, there was
not a vestige of green in this aviary ; the lifeless trees were
crowded with miscellaneous birds during the day ; and Violets,
remember, do not like artificial nest-boxes of any kind. They
chose a quiet corner on the top of the wire-netting roof of the
Burrowing Owls&apos; enclosure, and here a large heap of twigs, some
stout enough to be called sticks, was collected by the male, hay
following ; and then I interposed, destroying the nest and chang-
ing the female, not wishing to lose a bird from cold. This is the
only instance with me of a Violet-eared Waxbill in the garden
building elsewhere than in a living tree or growth of some kind.
Later, the same Violets were placed in the inner aviary, and a
nest was built in the top of a lime tree, some 9ft. from the ground ;
it was large, nearly round, compact, a typical nest of the species.
Before many days had passed it was deserted, why I do not
know ; perhaps it was too near the cats, perhaps too high off the
ground, perhaps the birds themselves were not really read\ r .

Nest No. 3 was built in some Virginia creeper, hardly a
natural site, but the vegetation was backward and the bushes at
the time were thin. Last year the bushes were thin, owing to the
aviary not having been reserved, and it was in the same creeper
that this pair builded that second nest which they had not had the
courage to occupy. This year&apos;s nest was a splendid construction,
neat, compact, tight — exceptionally and quite, remarkably so;
when I came to try and force a finger through, the finger met with
such resistance that I was unsuccessful until I tried the spot
where the aperture had been. Judging by appearances, the female
laid in this nest ; but the male would not sit, and spent his time
making love through the wire to his enemy&apos;s wife. I changed
the females, and there was a terrible outcry ; I restored them to
their proper mates, but all to no good. Then I removed the
pair from the inner aviary, and placed the other there, in order
to give them a chance — this was on June 10th. Some time
afterwards, I examined this last nest ; it then was empty and the
aperture firmly built up.
Notwithstanding the absence of covert in the outer aviarv
and the presence of its miscellaneous occupants, these same
birds went to nest again, this time in the semi-dead elder tree I
have referred to, in a site that was fully exposed to view, wind
and rain, and offered a not very safe hold for the nest — but there
was the bit of green, such as it was, 3ft. 9m. off the ground.
Seeing that they meant business, on June 16th I shut up all the
other birds, and left the Violets in sole possession of the aviary.
On the 18th, both were building; 19th — Male building steadily,
assisted rather feebly by female ; 20th — Roof put on ; 21st — Dome
finished before breakfast: afternoon, they began to carry feathers ;
22nd — Before breakfast, position of aperture altered from the
west to the south side of the nest, apparently because the wind
was now blowing sharply from about the north-west: a few
feathers carried late in afternoon : the male was in the nest most
•of the afternoon, and the female, just outside, like a wife leaning
her head on her husband&apos;s shoulder, had the appearance of
resting her head lovingly against the side of the nest; 23rd —
Before breakfast, aperture altered so as to face S.W., our peeping—

334 Mr. R. Phiixipps,
later date, as the bunch of elder twigs grew and partially-
sheltered and hid the nest from the west side, the aperture was
shifted back to its original position, where eventually it was
entirely concealed by leaves, the birds having to approach the nest
from the south and work their way round the side in order to gain
the aperture : both on nest together a good deal : a few feathers
carried ; 24th — Nest seemed finished : it was on the afternoon of
this day, during a heavy storm, noticing that the birds had taken
shelter out of sight round a corner of the house, I fixed up two
little boards above the nest, which threw off much of the rain.
The birds would not return until after noon of the following day ;
but without some protection so exposed a nest could not have
withstood the constant downpours. Soon afterwards, the birds
themselves greatly strengthened the roof, not only with grasses,,
but especially by working in quite a quantity of feathers, giving
the roof a curious appearance ; 27th — Both busy, male carrying
feathers and fine grass ; 28th — Touching up nest, and especially
attending to roof, and completing &apos; eye-brow&apos; over aperture.
I feel that, before I proceed, I ought to write a little more
particularly about the general structure and appearance of this
nest. There was only wheat, no grass, growing in the outer
aviary, and the stalks were now long and unwieldly. It was
deeply rooted, so I assisted by cutting and uprooting a good
deal. To get at the actual nest, the birds had to approach from
the side, and to carry over a dead branch or two on one side and
a little lower down. The long wheat-stalks trailed over this
branch, and formed altogether, at any rate to the casual observer,
something which had an appearance not far removed from an
untidy collection of rubbish, measuring, within a fraction of an
inch, two feet from apex to tip of lowest straggler.
Here we have a case of an experienced and capable
builder, who only a few weeks previously had built such a proper
right-and-tight nest as No. 3 already referred to, putting together
this shapeless affair, reminding one of nothing so much as a lot
of drift caught in the branches of a willow overhanging a stream
which has recently subsided after a spate, for of course the green
wheat-stalks withered and externally soon became bleached. It
was the case of a bird, ignoring personal experiences and the

examples of others, simply adapting himself to circumstances.
Now, compare this with the abnormal nests of certain English
Chaffinches in New Zealand which have become, I feel tempted to
say, rather ridiculously historical. That Chaffinch (or those
Chaffinches) found itself amongst a foreign vegetation, with
foreign material to build with. The trees were strange, the
materials were strange, the climate was strange, all the surround-
ings and attendant circumstances were strange, even the very
seasons were topsy-turvey. That a Chaffinch, half demented and
out of order after its long voyage, should have built a strange
nest under such strange conditions was about the only item in
the affair that was not strange ; it would have been strange
indeed if it had not. It was hardly a case to found an argument
upon. And this abnormal nest of the Violet-eared Waxbill, an
abnormal nest like that of the Chaffinch but constructed as we
know by an experienced builder, seems to weaken still more the
case of those who hold that, if opportunities of imitation, &amp;c, be
wanting, a bird cannot build a typical nest of its species. The
more the case is considered, the more one sees that this abnormal
nest of the Waxbills was a splendid instance of a bird making a
clever and intelligent best under very untoward circumstances ;
and that of the Chaffinch may well be regarded in a somewhat
similar light.
Although going about their work very quietly, the Violets,
especially the male, were endearingly tame. When the male
wanted anything, feathers for instance, directly I appeared he
would fly to and perch close beside me, and look up into my face
asking for what he needed as plainly as any dog would beg for
its tit-bit. When I produced the feathers, and stooped down to
separate and spread them out under a shed, I would find the
male on my one side and the female on the other ; and they
would commence to examine and select them before I had com-
pleted my work, and would carry to the nest before my face in
perfect confidence — but I never approached the nest, and kept
away as much as possible. In the inner aviary, where they liked
to think that I knew nothing about the nest, they had been
much more secretive and non-evident. Really their great care — --
seemed to be to conceal the aperture ; and, for the rest, surely

336 Mr. R. Phiujpps,
the extraneous matter took away all shape and appearance of a
nest from the one in the elder, and was quite sufficient to diddle
a mere man !
It is an unimportant point, and scarcely worth noting, but,
when the tips of their tails became curved from constant sitting
in the nest, while that of the male curved to the right, the
female&apos;s pointed to the left.
All during the building and sitting, the male, when
unoccupied, sang repeatedly ; but he ceased as soon as the young
were hatched.
To return to the nesting. The dates given below were
taken solely from the movements and behaviour of the old birds,
but I expect they are not far out.
The first egg may have been laid on June 29, but perhaps
it was not laid until the following day. An egg may have been
laid on July 1. Incubation dated from and included June 30.
A young bird was probably hatched during the 12th ; there
certainly were young in the nest 011 July 13. One bird was
always in the nest, — now one, now the other, sometimes both,
the relieving bird invariably going into the nest before the relieved
came out. Last year, when all the birds were about, the male sat
almost entirely, evidently in order that the eggs might be the
more efficiently guarded. This year, no other birds being in the
aviary with them, the female took her fair share of the work.
Towards the close of the incubation period, probably on account
of the cold and wet, both birds were more and more frequently
on the nest together; both slept in the nest at night.
After the young were hatched, a little change was made :
the bird outside did not enter the nest until after the other had
come out ; the former would come to the nest, say &apos;tit,&apos; the bird
inside would pop out and the other would pop in.
It soon became apparent that something was wrong. One
is so accustomed to regard a small seed-eater as a bird which will
rear young without giving trouble that it came with a shock to
find that these Violet-eared Waxbills wanted to feed their young
on living creatures. Now the male, now the female, as each bird
was off the nest, dashed against the netting that cut it off from
the thick foliage of the other aviary, darting from side to side in

its almost frantic endeavours to get to the trees, in order that it
might search for minute examples of life among the leaves. They
had one small patch of wheat which they searched through and
through many times a day and day after day, but clearly there
was a great shortage of live food. They would dart into the air
after any tiny creature, but were not clever at the work. The
male was by far the most industrious and useful, and would dig
away with his beak, especially near to where the garden wall
entered the ground ; and he continued this work so industriously
that he must have found something good. Occasionally, but
infrequently, he would scratch with his feet, much after the
manner of the Combasou and some of the smaller Whydahs.
He constantly, although the weather was now dry, nibbled and
seemed to suck away at the ends of growing wheat.
On the afternoon of July 15, a glorious day, both birds
were off the nest together. They were as tight as sticks, and as
slim ; with feverish activity they were searching for food ; in the
bright sun, the brilliant colours of their beautiful plumage shone
and almost sparkled as they darted about — a truly charming little
picture.
On the afternoons of July 16 and 17, bright and warm,
both were off together and working hard. I noticed that they
were gathering aphides off the elder leaves — black nasty-looking
things; could they have been harmful? it is unusual for birds
to touch them, I think.
All along I had been supplying what artificial food I could
think of. I had heard of some &apos; fresh live ants&apos; eggs &apos; ; they
arrived on the evening of the 17th, and some were at once sup-
plied to the Violets. 18th — Very cold morning: neither hunting
much : both looked full and contented ; 19th — Too &apos; contented &apos; :
female carrying feathers to nest ; 20th — Carrying feathers : female
on nest almost the whole day. Was this a final effort to revive a
feeble chick? 21st — Nest deserted, and female &apos;sleepy.&apos; Nest
empty : no trace of young : one half of an egg which had once
contained a young bird found below nest ; 22nd — Female very
ill; 25th— Dead.
The change in the behaviour and appearance of the^aLd-
birds synchronized so precisely with the arrival of the fresh ants&apos;

eggs that I attributed the illness of the female to them ; and
when I did realize what was wrong it was too late — it is doubtful
if she could have been saved in any case. Notwithstanding
something like a week of dry weather (some of the nights and
mornings were exceedingly cold), the foundation and lower parts
of the nest were found to be wet and mouldy, the heavy solid
dome being dry. The parts of the tree-stem and branches, and
the bunch of branchlets, where the nest had been pitched, were
well covered with mildew, mealy-bug, and the like. When I
saw the birds carrying feathers, I put an evil construction on
their actions : the poor creatures were really endeavouring to
ameliorate the miserable condition of the nest. Such a state of
affairs was more than sufficient to account for the death of the
young — probably two, possibly more — and the fatal illness of the
mother. She died of acute inflammation of the kidneys.
Just about the same time, a pair of Ringed Finches reared
three young in the adjoining aviary. The Rings are delicate,
they had the same weather as the Violets, and yet their young
are now flying about well and strong, and their mother is sitting
again — for the third time this summer. Why success in the one
case and disaster in the other?
The Rings&apos; nest was built at the top of a pollard lime
tree&apos;s upright stem, in the midst of a thick clump of leaves, the
materials being old hay and feathers, no green wheat nor grass.
The tree in which was built the nest of the Violet-eared Waxbill
was quite dead from the top of the thickly-branched head and
downwards as far as the fork where the nest was pitched. At
this joint, there was a cluster of thickly-leaved branchlets, which
held the damp and screened the nest from the sun. The thick
leaves of the lime dispersed the rain. The bare branches of the
elder not only collected the rain, but acted as so many runnels to
conduct the water to the fork, where it was intercepted, sucked
up and held by the mass of materials which had been collected at
this spot. Even the thick wheat-stalks helped to contribute to
the mischief; externally they appeared to have been dried up,
but the inner mass must have become heated. A fermenting
nest may be a very delightful place for a Dabchick, but can hardly
be quite the thing for a Violet-eared Waxbill. When I put the

boards up over the nest, I should have decapitated the tree and
not have stopped at half measures ; better far that it should have
been deserted altogether than that this calamity should have been
permitted.
How delightful it is to be so wise — after the event !
It was with a heavy heart that I dismantled the nest ; it
was a splendid piece of workmanship, and deserving of much
more praise than I have bestowed upon it.
Only one thing more is needed — that the Violets become
so far civilized (and, alas ! degenerate) as to nest in artificial
structures, safe from rain and damp.

By Harold E. Atteweu..
Having long suspected a certain gully but a girl&apos;s stone
throw from my house to be the headquarters of sundry Green
Todies (Todus viridisj frequently seen, I, late in June, paid
the locality a visit, the result proving most abundantly the
reasonableness of my conclusions.
The gully is a typical Jamaican storm-water course, which,
except for possibly a few hours once in six months, is dry. The
bed is of sandy shingle, and what vegetation does exist is of the
coarsest nature. The banks are usually sheer and may be inches
or many feet in height. When the water is there it usually
sweeps everything before it, leaving a clean-cut course.
A number of circular borings of about i£ inches in dia-
meter first indicated the likeliuess of the Tody&apos;s domestic
quarters, and, singularly enough, the very first tunnel examined
proved to be one then occupied for breeding. The soil here was
extremely friable and would have yielded to a matchstick, thus
reducing to a miminum the efforts of the engineer. At about
9m. from the entrance, in a rounded chamber of possibly 2jin.
diameter, lay, with no nesting material whatever, on the bare
soil, two lovely globular eggs of lustrous pink pear-like trans-
lucency, quite the most beautiful eggs I have seen, and evidently
newly laid. Just as the most beautiful gems are discovered

340 Mr. H. E. Attewell,
amongst the roughest surroundings, so it would seem the most
beautiful birds&apos; eggs are deposited in borings or holes on the
bare earth. For the size of the Tody their eggs are larger than
might be expected. So much for clutch No. i.
Not many yards distant another pair of Todies had laid
their young. Under exactly similar circumstances, here were a
probably two-day old chick, an egg about to hatch and another
in the earlier stage of incubation, its lustre was clouded.
It is quite evident incubation begins with the first egg
and that these are laid at some interval. The period of incuba-
tion is probably short and it may be the earth would assist rather
than retard the same, for, as in caverns, the temperature would,
in the mean, prove higher than in the tree-top.
Within little more than an hour I had the good or mis-
fortune to find four other breeding holes, nesting-places would
hardly be correct, for, in no case was so much as wisp or feather
to be found. In one case only did the boring deviate from a
slightly inclined and oblique shaft, and, in every case these were
of approximately 9 in. depth. The exception mentioned, quite
near the entrance, turned at right angle to the left, and thus, but
2 hi. from the surface, to which the shaft ran parallel, were
discovered three callow young with a very perceptible difference
in size.
The other two broods not } r et accounted for each contained
three 3&apos;oung; one brood being partially and the other fully
fledged. In the hopes of rearing young Todies I carried home
these ten infants.
For four days they flourished exceedingly and their growth
was rapid. Wasp-grubs, moths, flies and such like were relished
and the readiness with which they fed filled me with hope. In
order to give them most regular feeding I carried them with me
to Kingston. It may have been an expression of approval or
dissent, but, at any rate, these tiny creatures were so voluble,
especially so when the tramcar stopped and more particularly so
on the homeward trip, that, on the morrow, I did not care to
advertise myself in this way and thankfully entered into a twelve
hours contract with Mrs. Attewell. The chirruping of the birds
being like that of a brood of chicken settling down for the night.

o?i Green Todies. — Atte??ipt to rear the Yoxing in Jamaica. 341
Alas on the evening of the fourth day a death occurred,
and, one by one, without apparent reason, the infants dropped
off, until, on the eighth day one only remained on the perches,
and he, so vigorous was he, managed to escape, flying clear and
easily away.
Gosse expresses surprise that the natives do not cage and
keep the Tody in confinement; knowing both bird and native,
my surprise would be rather to find the Tody so entertained.
Not every Jamaican can understand the reasonableness of caring
for a creature that yields no tangible return. I have frequently
been asked by some urchin for a canary or other cage-bird, and,
on enquiring the use for such, have in most matter of fact way
been told &amp;quot; eat him ! &amp;quot;
In Gosse&apos;s time he writes the Tody was common. It is,
in view of the ease with which my six examples were found,
singular, that he should admit having no knowledge of the &apos;nest,&apos;
eggs or young. It is also equally strange that he should have
been so badly informed by Mr. Hill, who stated the material of
which the nest was made and the colour of the markings on the
eggs. The beautiful lustre of these is due to a particularly dark
yelk and the mere shell is disappointingly dead.
Mr. Taylor, too, I fancy mistakes when he says the Tody is
much reduced in numbers by the mongoose, for as a matter of
fact, quite near this gully, I have in one trap caught five mon-
gooses within a fortnight, thus proving the prevalence of the
animal in proximity to considerable numbers of Todies.
Reverting to the breeding site again, it is noteworthy that
all the six examples were found in the more sheltered north bank
and three eggs would appear to be a normal clutch.
The trip I write of is of more interest to me, for, although
I have accideutly and otherwise handled hundreds of scorpions,,
until now, I have not had the good fortune to be accidentally
stung. Here was a means of defence the Tody had that I did
not reckon on. A black scorpion was at home in one hole my
fingers investigated, and a well deserved reception was accorded
me. Profiting by this, a stick did deputy-finger work after, with
the result that a larger scorpion in one instance and a Croaking
lizard another were evicted.

The plentifulness of the Tody is demonstrated, yet on the
occasion of which I write, although I was on the look-out for old
birds I saw but two. It is often er not seen. And even when
perched on a favourite bare twig-end, despite its scarlet throat,
it is easily unobserved, so like foliage is the bird&apos;s green. There
he sits with an inoffensive expression and an attitude of absolute
indifference, with his head pointing upwards. But he is not
strong flighted, nor can he, living on insects, capture them by
chase as do the Swallows; the insect must be allured near him,
and my idea is, that scarlet throat is calculated to deceive. The
unsuspecting insect mistakes it for some flower, hovers near it
for a moment, just long enough for the Tody to make a dart of a
few feet, and the consequence is another misguided insect is
entombed. Its only requiem being a &apos;snap,&apos; &apos; snap&apos; of the bird&apos;s
mandibles.

My pair of Adelaide Parrakeets came from our Editor
towards the end of last year, and when writing me recently he
said he had no record of these birds nesting successfully in
captivity.
As most of our members have seen, these birds are not
unlike immature Pennants just finishing the moult and not in
full colour. I remember that I once bought a pair of immature
Pennants which the dealer at the time declared were Adelaides.
The Adelaides were given an aviary in which only two
other small birds resided — a pair of Parrot-Finches— and I have
nothing of interest to relate, until a few weeks back I saw they
were nesting, and finally four young ones left the nest and are
now flying about. Their markings are like those of their parents
excepting that the ground-colour is of a more greenish shade.
I consider the red marks quite as distinct as the parents&apos;.
My birds have nested very freely this year and I have
quite a number of young birds. One interesting Parrakeet, not

This little book contains some extremely good photographs
of Australian birds and their nests, accompanied by notes from
the pen of Mr. Robert Hall. It is intended to be quite popular,
and to create an interest for birds amongst those who do not
profess to have any knowledge of the subject : but this object
would not have been frustrated had the notes been a little fuller
and more precise and the scientific names of the species given.
Of the Blue Wren we are only told that he is &amp;quot; a friend of the
tiller of the soil,&amp;quot; and eats eighty noxious grubs a day. If his
nesting habits and change of plumage had been described it
would surely have been to the advantage of all concerned.
The Varied Hemipode is photographed on its nest, but the
accompanying note merely tells the reader that it is the Painted
Quail and that it &amp;quot; lies quietly in its nest upon the ground and is
at once photographed.&amp;quot;
We should have expected that so experienced an ornith-
ologist as Mr. Hall would have seen that a popular booklet of
this kind was made as instructive as possible.

A medal has been awarded to Mr. W. E. Teschemaker
for having successfully bred the Yellow- rumped Serin Finch
(Serinus a?igole?isis) for the first time in the United Kingdom.
Mr. W. R. Fasey has successfully bred the Adelaide Parra-
keet (Platycercus adelaidensis) and, although this species has been
crossed with other species, we are not aware of any previous
case of pure - bred Adelaide Parrakeets being reared in the
United Kingdom. If any member or reader knows of a case it
is particularly requested that the Hon. Secretary may be at once
informed ; otherwise the case will go before the Committee
to decide whether a medal shall be awarded.

Sir, — It is no pleasure to me to express a different opinion from an
old friend and colleague, but I think if Mr. Pocock had confined his
remarks in answer to Mr. Astley to the single fact that he is obliged to
combine exhibition with preservation he would have been wiser. When he
tells us that the opinion of &amp;quot; the highest possible authority &amp;quot; has been
regarded as unworthy of attention, because the birds which were being
improperly fed appeared to be in excellent health, I am afraid he rather
gives himself away.
A Parrot may be fed upon improper food (upon the same food indeed
which has caused the early death of hundreds of its own species), and yet,
on account of its individual constitutional vigour may continue to live in
apparently excellent health for ten, fifteen, or even twenty years; yet in the
end this vigorous bird breaks down in exactly the same manner, exhibiting

precisely the same symptoms as those individuals of its species which
succumbed to improper treatment within a few weeks: the slow breaking
down of a strong constitution does not justify the use of improper diet.
The importance of fresh air and the comparative unimportance of
heat in aviculture, have been more and more realized as the study of living
birds has advanced in this country, and Mr. Astley&apos;s views are shared by many
of those who have not had so long or so wide an experience of bird-keeping
as he has. It is true that there are some birds, like Neochmia phaeton,
Granatina granatina and apparently some of the Humming-birds, which
seem unable to bear cold ; but this may be in part due to the fact that they
have been for some time confined in a more or less close atmosphere. I
have always regarded the African Weavers as extremely hard}&apos; birds; but,
after keeping some of these birds four or five 3&apos;ears in an indoor aviary, I
turned four into an open aviary at the end of my garden ; the result was
that, for two months whenever the weather was dull or at all cold they
would all be seen huddled up on the branches and apparently ill ; one of
them died (plump and in perfect plumage) the others are now quite
indifferent to the weather.
In my opinion even Humming-birds, in spite of their love of sun-
shine, would stand a better chance of survival in the open air than in a
hothouse temperature: if some Humming-birds do not object to cold and
even snow, there seems no reason win- others should not become accustomed
to the same. In his &amp;quot; Naturalist&apos;s Notes in Ecuador,&amp;quot; Avic. Blag. 1st series
vol. VI., p. 66, Mr. Walter Goodfellow says: — &amp;quot; The little Black Hummer
with a sapphire throat, known as Jameson&apos;s Humming-bird, I have seen,
when camping out on the volcano of Pichincha, Coudor shooting, flying
past our tent in a heavy snow storm, with its mournful twit, twit, at an
altitude of over 14,000 feet.&amp;quot;
It is one thing to think one&apos;s own way of doing things the only way,
and it is much the same thing to persist in one&apos;s own way of doing things
when those whom we ourselves admit to be the highest possible authorities
have pointed out our errors : it is very human not to relish advice, but
where there is the least possible chance of our being in the wrong, and the
welfare of our fellow creatures— &amp;quot; Little brothers of the air &amp;quot; as they have
been called — is threatened, it is inhuman not to attend to it.
Mr. Astle} 7 , like all sensible avicultu lists, would be the last to over-
look the enormous labour of superintending our extensive Zoological
Gardens and the many considerations which must weigh with a Super-
intendent in deciding upon the housing and treatment of animals reputed
to be delicate ; and I am perfectly sure that iu his criticism of the
arrangements for keeping birds in the Insect and Parrot-houses, he never
thought for a moment that Mr. Pocock would consider himself to be

FRESH AIR FOR CAGE BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996906744186046" page_id="33229384"  page_num="346" year="" vol="">
Sir, — 111 criticising the methods adopted by the Zoological Society
of London of keeping certain of the birds in the collection at the Gardens,
I thought that I might have done so without having thrown at my head
several brickbats by the hands of one of the officials, and also without
having the honour done me of an article in our magazine written
(apparently) on myself. It is true I have for a great many years made birds
so much a part of my existence, that I may possibly have become one, but
certainly without being aware of it ! and it would seem to be permissible to
criticise a Society which in a manner belongs to the public, and of which I
have been a Fellow for a goodly number of years, without such an
onslaught ! I am told that I have &amp;quot;indulged in one or two gibes, which are
perhaps intended to be funny and not unfriendly,&amp;quot; but which &amp;quot; are wholly
inexcusable withal &amp;quot; ; that my opinion &amp;quot; is worth very little attention
because it is founded on assumptions of the flimsiest kind,&amp;quot; and that I
&amp;quot;should probably have seen&amp;quot; the Superintendent&apos;s points had I &amp;quot;been less
intent on proclaiming the superiority of my own methods over those
practised in the Zoological Gardens.&amp;quot;
I am not quite sure whether all this is intended &amp;quot; to be funny, and
not unfriendly ?&amp;quot;
When I wrote about the Sugar Birds (in the July magazine) not
needing glass cases, being as yet uustuffed, I certainly wrote seriously, and
there was no idea of either unfriendliness or the contrary, as I merely
wished to impress the fact that caged as they were, they were kept in an
extremely unnatural condition, and moreover distinctly showed the effects
of it.
Nor had I any idea of &amp;quot;proclaiming the superiority of my own
methods,&amp;quot; for I was trying to support the methods of someone rather more
important than myself, namely Dame Nature ! On her opinion are founded
my flimsiest of assumptions ! Some years ago, people would have shrieked
with dismay had they been told that consumptive patients with hacking
coughs and failing lungs, must if they wished to be cured, sit out all day
with the snow lying round them, and sleep all night with window-sashes
removed. Now they know better.
In conclusion, I merely intended in my former letter to support a very
excellent principle that birds, like everything else, need &amp;quot; a proper
percentage of oxygen,&amp;quot; which is only to be found in a truly unadulterated
and inodorous condition as Nature gives it us, and that is most certainly not
in a glass-case within a heated &amp;quot;conservatory!&amp;quot;
Nor did I for one moment intend to imply that no artificial heat or
protection from cold and damp is needed in certain cases, or at certain
times. Cela va sans dire ! I rather anticipate an indignant letter from one
of the officials of the L.C.C., because I was impertinent enough in that same
former article to disparage the soot-begrimed air of the Metropolis.

THE CRANES.
By Hubert D. Asteey, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
It might perhaps be useful to some of our members to cata-
logue a list, with a short, and I fear incomplete, description, etc.,
of the members of one of the most splendid families amongst
birds. The Cranes are so stately in their movements, so easily
kept in captivity, so tameable and as a rule so long-lived, that it
is not to be wondered at if with some aviculturists they rank
amongst their very first favourites. The late Lord Ljlford was
especially fond of them, and possessed nearly every known
species, if not every one.
Let us consider their names and habitats, etc.
* # a?
i. The Common Crane (Grus communis).
Once fairly abundant in England, now alas ! like the Great
Bustard and others, no longer to be found.
Hab. : The greater part of Europe and Asia, wintering in
North Africa and Northern India, etc.
Of a fine dark grey colour, face and neck black with white
on the cheek running downwards longitudinally. Skin on crown
of head, cherry red. Wing feathers elongated and curved like
a cock&apos;s tail. The call is sonorous and can be heard at a great
distance. * * *

feathers black, the inner secondaries being curved and arched as
in the Common Crane.
Crown of head covered with rough red skin. Bill, greenish

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.91750025" page_id="33229392"  page_num="348" year="" vol="">
Perhaps the most splendid of the family, and one of the
most magnificent of birds ; well known as depicted upon Japanese
screens.
Colour, snowy white. Throat and cheeks, deep black-grey,
the same running downwards on each side of the neck, and
meeting near the base, behind.
Secondaries, black, the feathers being broadened and
curved. Bill, greenish horn ; legs, greyish black.
The Mantchurian Crane has often nested in captivity. The
call is extremely sonorous and resounding.
Habitat: Eastern Siberia and Mautchuria; wintering iu
Corea and China. * • # .#
4. The Hooded Crane (Grits monachus).
After the style of the Common Crane. General colour,
dark slately-grey with a brownish tinge, deepening into slately-
black on the curved wing feathers and the tail. Face and greater
part of neck, pure white. Forehead : red skin with black hairs.
Hab. : Eastern Siberia, wintering in China and Corea. Extreme-
ly rare in confinement in Europe. Lord Ljlford possessed one
specimen. % # %

<bodyText confidence="0.98795425" page_id="33229392"  page_num="348" year="" vol="">
Called also the Whooping Crane. Alas ! all but extinct,
(according to Herr. Carl Hageubeck). A most beautiful bird.
Snowy white with black primaries, and the skin on the crown of
the head of a brilliant maroon-cherry red.
A pair still exists in the Zoological Gardens at Amsterdam,
but there are probably not many more in the world. It inhabited
Central North America, wintering in Florida and Central Mexico.
Its general style and size is that of the Mantchurian Crane.

</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.839937416666667" page_id="33229393"  page_num="349" year="" vol="">
A sombre edition of the Common Crane, being of a
•general grey colour, with no well denned black and white on the
face and neck as in the European bird.
It is also called the Sandhill Crane.
Hab. : North America, south to Mexico. They live well
in captivity. # # #
7. The Sarus Crane (Grus collaris).
A very tall and stately bird of a fine French grey colour,
the elongated plumes of the wings that hang over the tail, being
whitish.
Skin on forehead and crown, pale ashen green ; rest of
head featherless and of a scarlet red with black hairs.
The upper part of the neck is white, forming a collar.
The French call it &amp;quot; Grue a collier.&amp;quot;
Hab. : Northern India.
Not infrequently imported, but has probably never bred in
Europe. * A . ^
8. The Eastern Sarus Crane {Grus antigone).
Exactly the same style of bird as the Indian Sarus, but of
a general grey colour throughout; the red skin of the head
extends farther down the neck, and the skin on the crown is
■more yellowish. Perhaps even taller than the G. collaris.
Hab. : Burmah, Siam and Malay Peninsula.
Rarely imported.
Imagine a flock of 600 of these magnificent birds circling
round in mid-air, which sight Dr. John Anderson once witnessed
iu Upper Burmah.

9. The Australian Crane {Grus australasiana) .
The Native-Companion of the Colonists.
i[See Vol. VIII., Avicultural Mag., Nov. 1901, for the account of the nesting
of a pair of these birds iu my possession. — H.D.A.]
Not unlike the Sarus Crane, but less tall. General colour,
pale blue-grey, feathers of back and wings having lighter margins.
Primaries, black. Crown of head and bill, olive-green ; eye, fine
orange-yellow ; round the ears and the back of the head, coral-

red papillose skin, with fine black hairs. A gular pouch of bare
skin, olive green.
It is the only Crane in the whole of Australia. Both male
and female call loudly together, standing with their heads back
and their bills pointed upwards, the male meanwhile drooping
his wings and moving them up and down. The cry is very loud,
and, at a little distance, wild and musical.
Like most of the Cranes, the Australian Native-Companion
is very hardy, and I lost my first old male through his persisting
in standing at night knee-deep in a stream during hard frost,
the consequence being that he was frozen in, and killed himself
in his evidently frantic struggles to be liberated.
Previously he had had one wing amputated at the shoulder,
having been kicked by a horse, in the park, which he had
attacked, his whole wing being completely shattered.

10. The Demoiselle, or Numidian Crane (A?ithropoides
virgo).
The smallest of all the family, and one of the best known.
General colour, pearly grey. Wing feathers (secondaries),
very elongated and pendant, grey with black tips. Tail, dark
grey. Crown of head light grey, the remainder of the head,
throat, and foreneck, slaty black, the feathers of the latter very
elongated. A white tuft of silky white feathers springs from
behind the eyes, and curves downwards on each side of the neck.
Eyes, bright crimson, bill and legs greyish horn colour. Total
length, 33 inches.
The males are usually the largest, and the ear tufts are
longer.
[See Vol. VII., No. 5, March 1901, Avic. Mag., Mr. Lascelles&apos; account of the
nesting of these Cranes in captivity].
Hab. : S.E. Europe and throughout Central Asia to
Mongolia, wintering in N. and N.E. Africa and N.W. India.
A most graceful and tameable bird, as well as perfectly
hardy; thriving best 011 a dry soil. This Crane is imported
in large numbers. In some parts of Europe the eggs are
collected and hatched out under hens. It&apos;s cry is a rather
harsh crake, but very musical in the distance.

11. The Stanley Crane (A?ithropozdes paradised).
A most beautiful species, larger than the Demoiselle, but
not so large as any of the other kinds.
General colour, pearl grey with a bluish tint ; primaries,
black ; secondaries, dark grey with black tips, which are
enormously lengthened and almost touch the ground. Feathers
of the cheeks and back of head lengthened and loose, so as to
form a puff. Forehead and crown, white ; bill, flesh colour.
Total length, about 40 inches.
Hab. : South Africa, Mashonaland, Great Namaqualaud,
and Damaraland. In a wild state, it devours large numbers of
locusts, and on that account requires more meat food in captivity
than most of the other species. This Crane becomes very tame,
and will often remain, when allowed full liberty, near the
place where it has been reared. Regularly imported to Europe.

12. The Wattled Crane {Anthropoides carunculata).
One of the rarest in captivity. A large bird of striking
appearance. General colour above, ashy grey. Mantle, under-
pays, primaries, and secondaries, black ; the secondary wing-
feathers much elongated and pendant. Crown of head, slaty
grey. Whole of neck, cheeks, and fore breast, white. Face
covered with red skin. Two wattles with white feathers depend
at the throat. Byes, orange yellow ; bill, yellowish brown ; legs,
dark grey.
Hab. : S. Africa, part of the Congo, and F. to Shoa. Very
tame and playful in captivity. Very partial to water.

13. The White-necked Crane (Anthropoides leziccnichen).
The Imperial Crane. A splendid bird after the style of the
Man tchuriau.
General colour above, slaty grey. Wing coverts, lighter;
secondaries, white, being lengthened, curved, and pointed. Fore-
neck, breast, and underparts, dark slaty grey. Head, hind neck
to the back, white. Forehead and face, covered with redskin, on
which are black hairs. Fyes, yellowish ; bill, greenish ^JU^f^,
dull pink.

A large showy bird. Colour : Purest white, with black
primaries. Red bare skin on the face, extending to just behind
the eyes. Eyes, bright yellow with a somewhat fierce expression.
Beak, yellowish-brown ; legs, pink.
Hab. : S.E. Europe and Asia Minor to N.E. China.

15. The Crowned Crane {Balearica pavonina*).
{Avic Mag., New Series, Vol. I,, March and April, 1903).
The coloured illustrations in the magazine will show this
birds&apos; appearance better than a verbal description. The
peculiarity of this Crane is the beautiful tuft of straw-like
bristles on the back of the head. When the wings are spread,
the bird looks much whiter, owing to the display of the wing-
coverts. There are two other kinds of Crowned Cranes, viz. :
Balearica regulorum. The Cape Crowned Crane ; which is lighter
in colour than B. pavonina, where it is grey, and usually has the
skin of the cheeks white, with bare red wattles at the throat:
and I believe that a third species was obtained on the White
Nile, near Khartoum. It is smaller and darker than B. pavonina,
and again differs in the shape of the red and white cheek patches.
Balearica pavonina inhabits W. Africa to Abyssinia and
the tributaries of the Nile.
B. regulorum inhabits S. Africa.
The cry of these Cranes very closely resembles the
trumpet of a motor-car, and people have often mistaken it for
that when hearing my birds call in the distance. They are very
beautiful birds, and when once acclimatized seem extremely
hardy. I have possessed three specimens of B. pavonina for five
years, which have been on open ground with no shelter even in
winter time except natural rushes and bushes.

On Septic Enteritis. 353
For success in breeding Cranes they require a grassy
paddock to themselves. They nest on the ground, collecting
rushes for that purpose. Not more than one pair should occupy
an enclosure, and if there is marshy ground, so much the better,
and shallow water in which thay can wade. They will eat grain,
crissel, potatoes, bread, greaves, fish and meat, and they delight
ill grubbing up the earth in search of roots of plants and worms.
They are, as a rule, long-lived birds, some specimens having
been known to live more than thirty years, in captivity. If
allowed to walk about without being enclosed, the larger kinds
are not always safe, for they will attack people fiercely and
sometimes quite unexpectedly. It is best to pinion Cranes,
unless their enclosure is covered over with netting, for if the
wing-feathers are only clipped, it is difficult to know exactly
when to catch the birds up at the moult, and I once lost a
magnificent pair of Mantchuriaus because of this.
N,B. — Those who want to know all about the Crane
family should, if they do not already possess it, purchase &amp;quot;A
Monograph of the Cranes,&amp;quot; a beautiful work with finely coloured
plates of each species by Mr. F. E. Blaauw, whom we are glad to
count as one of the members of the Avicultural Society.
SEPTIC ENTERITIS.
By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Some details of an outbreak of this destructive disease,
which I am able to give, may be interesting, and perhaps useful,
to some of my fellow aviculturists.
A sitting of Capercaillie&apos;s eggs laid here by a tame bird,
was put under a cross-bred Silky-Game Bantam, and six chicks
were hatched on June the 20th, one egg being unfertile. Up
to July the 20th, the young birds were thriving and growing
fast. On the evening of this day we noticed that one of them
left off feeding before the others had finished, and huddled
up against the little hen, and I remarked that the bird must have
got a chill. The affected chick was worse the next morning,
and died before noon on the 21st. On the 22nd another died.

Thinking that they perhaps wanted more space, I moved the
brood on to some quite fresh ground, with shade and shelter,
and plenty of fresh grass, and the food was slightly changed.
The young Capercaillies seemed to delight in the change, and
ranged about freely with the hen, scratching and dusting, and
evidently finding a great deal of insect food, as well as plucking
the flowering heads of the grasses. However, another chick
died on the 26th and was sent to Mr. Gill for examination. To
my dismay the report came back, &amp;quot; Septic Rnteritis &amp;quot; ; and I
realized that I had to deal with a formidable outbreak. In the
meanwhile the survivors, which were of about the size of
Grouse, seemed perfectly well, actively wandering about the
enclosure (about a quarter of an acre) ; but on the 28th of July
another died, and another on the 3rd of August ; in each case after
about twenty-four hours illness. The sixth bird survived until
the 6th of August. This last bird was seen to be amiss on the
1st of August, but it lingered five days, the lameness in one leg,
which was greatly swelled, constantly increasing until the poor
bird could not stand or move.
I am under the impression that, in the human subject,
septic poisoning sometimes takes the form of local inflammatory
swelling of some limb : and if I am right, this bird also had
taken the infection from the same source, and only lived a few
days longer than the others because the vital organs were not
immediately attacked.
I was quite unable at first to account for the appearance of
the disease, but after talking it over with my Bird-keeper, he
reminded me that the female of an apparently sound pair of
Cabot&apos;s Tragopans, which I had myself selected in Loudon, and
sent down on the 13th of June, had been noticed to be ailing on
the 23rd and had died on the 26th (when I was abroad). As ill
luck would have it, a violent thunderstorm occurred 011 the nth
of July, and the young Capercaillies were, for about three hours,
placed for shelter in the shed in which the Tragopan had died.
The following dates show the progress of the disease : —
13th June. The Tragopans were placed in the shed.
20th June. The female bird was amiss, and she died on the 26th
June.

rated above.
Besides the male Tragopan, the hen that brought up the
Capercaillies has escaped the infection, but I am keeping the
latter isolated, and the shed is to be disinfected, and the enclosure
dressed with quicklime.
The whole thing is very disappointing, for Capercaillies
are difficult to rear, and the greatest care had been taken with
this brood, which was, up to the date of the thunderstorm, in the
best of health.
It will be noticed that the period of incubation of the
enteritis in the case of the first young Capercaillie, was about
nine days, as the bird was exposed to the infection on the nth
July and it began to sicken on the 20th.

Ctictdus canorus.
By Gordon Dai^guesh.
This paper claims in no way to be altogether original, and
I have drawn largely from the writings of others, and to many
much of the information contained herein will not be new. I
have endeavoured in one paper to collect together a mass of
interesting notes as a foundation to work upon, and to induce
people to study more closely, if possible, this interesting bird
and to fill up many gaps in its life history.
Each year, as the pendulum of Time swings to and fro
and Spring brings to our shores the Cuckoo, fresh perplexing
problems of that &amp;quot; bird of mystery &amp;quot; present themselves to us in
full force. Perhaps there is no bird that has claimed the atten-
tions of naturalists more than the Cuckoo, and yet how very
little we really know about it. Most of our knowledge relating to
its parasitic habits are mere hypothesis based in many cases on
insufficient grounds. The Cuckoo is by no means an easy bird
to study, and to the majority of ordinary people is far better&amp;quot;&amp;quot;

known by its voice than actual appearance. It is a shy bird,
having a wonderful adaptation of hiding itself from view, though
its audible and far penetrating cry makes itself heard for a con-
siderable distance.
Thanks to numerous observers throughout the country many
actual facts have been established, which now make it possible
to base our theories on substantial ground, in spite of the ever-
lasting verdict of &amp;quot;probable though not proven&amp;quot; presenting
itself on every hand. An old Scotch name for the Cuckoo is
&amp;quot;gowk&amp;quot; (a fool in Scotland is spoken of as a &amp;quot; gowk,&amp;quot;) but why
this should be I can never understand. That a bird should save
itself the trouble of catering for and looking after a family is, I
think, sufficient proof of cunning and deep thought and not
want of intellect. A Cuckoo&apos;s cry is easily imitated, and in
consequence the bird is readily decoyed. It is perhaps on this
account the name of &amp;quot;gowk&amp;quot; was given to it. When decoyed
both male and female come, and on one occasion I had three hen
Cuckoos flying around uttering their curious &amp;quot; bubbling &amp;quot; cry.
On several occasions whilst imitating the cry, small birds, notably
Willow Wrens and Yellow Buntings exhibited symptoms of ex-
citement. Many of the pictures of Cuckoos in books are drawn
quite wrong, that is with the mouth wide open. When uttering
its well known cry the bird does not open the bill, the breast being
then inflated like a pigeon and the tail slightly raised. This I
have many times witnessed. That the female bird calls &amp;quot;cuckoo&amp;quot;
is open to doubt, normally her cry is a low chuckle, or else a
gurgling bubbling note, at times sounding not unlike that of an
alarmed Blackbird. The old rhyme goes, &amp;quot;In June he changes
his tune,&amp;quot; and this is sometimes wonderfully correct. On the
first of June last year 1906, I woke very early, and the first bird
note I heard was the broken &amp;quot; cuck cuck 00 &amp;quot; ; but this is often
heard in May as well. The average date of the arrival of the
Cuckoo is April 20th. In many papers and periodicals there are
notes about Cuckoos having been heard in March, or even Feb-
ruary ; but there is no proper foundation for these early dates.
In all cases only the cry has been heard, but no bird has been
procured or seen ; and until a February or March Cuckoo has
actually been secured, it is not wise to place any reliance on
these reports.

on the Cuckoo. 357
As before stated the cry of the Cuckoo is easy of imitation ;.
and on the bright sunny days that often occur in February or
March, one&apos;s thoughts are apt to wander on to summer, and from
summer to the Cuckoo, and perhaps unconsciously we are apt to
give vent to our feelings, by uttering the cry well known to all :
hence the explanation of &amp;quot; Early Cuckoos.&amp;quot; Does the Cuckoo
eat other birds&apos; eggs? This is another point that wants attention.
Many country people declare they do. Most naturalists, how-
ever, are agreed that the egg seen in the Cuckoo&apos;s bill was its
own, and until some competent observer actually detects it in the
art of pilfering a bird&apos;s nest we must leave this an open question.
Personally I see no reason at all why it should not eat eggs: some
of its foreign relatives do so. I once saw an Indian Cuckoo, the
Koel (Eudnaniys honorata), rob a Dove&apos;s nest, and fly off with the
egg in its bill, hotly pursued by the owner. On hearing the
imitated cry of a Cuckoo, a pair of Missel Thrushes I saw, got
very excited, and fumed and fussed about, uttering notes of
defiance. Now the Cuckoo has not been known to deposit its
egg in that of a Missel Thrush&apos;s nest, so that the Thrush would
have no cause of fear from that quarter. On the other hand if
the Cuckoo does eat eggs its cry would naturally put the Thrushes
on the qui vive for the safety of theirs.
Perhaps the most extraordinary part of the whole life
history of the Cuckoo is the matching of its eggs with those of
the different birds into whose nests its eggs are deposited. One
theory is that a Cuckoo deposits her eggs in the nest of the species
in which she herself was raised ; and the argument to support this
is that, on the Continent, the eggs of Cuckoos have been found
in the nests of species which do not nest in this country, namely,
the Orphean Warbler, Icterine Warbler and Great Reed Warbler,
matching the eggs with types of Cuckoo&apos;s eggs unknown in
Britain. Eggs of Cuckoos have been found in empty nests of
Hedge Sparrow, Meadow Pipit, Pied Wagtail, Red-backed Shrike,
and twice in Reed Warblers ; in each instance the egg was
designed to match those of the owners (Countryside, Vol. III.,
No. 68.). Mr. Gillett Cory, writing to the same paper, says: —
&amp;quot; I have had the privilege of seeing some sixteen nests, ^each,
containing a Cuckoo&apos;s egg of different kinds of birds with their

respective clutches of eggs, in every case of which the Cuckoo&apos;s
egg (had it not been for its slightly larger size) could scarcely
have been distinguished from those of the intended foster
parents, even such details as the delicate pencilling seen on the
eggs of Chaffinch, Goldfinch and others being closely imitated.&amp;quot;
Though matching its eggs so well, Cuckoo&apos;s eggs found
in Hedge Sparrows&apos; nests (one of its commonest victims) are
seldom blue, and one theory to account for this is that the
Cuckoo during the course of evolution has only recently been
attracted to this bird, and as time goes on, the eggs will event-
ually always be blue.
Blue would appear to be the rarest colour of a Cuckoo&apos;s
egg. The British Museum possesses four authenticated specimens
and these are all except one, Continental, and were all taken
from the nests of the Redstart. Butler figures a blue egg in his
&amp;quot; Birds&apos; Eggs of the British Isles,&amp;quot; and I find a note of another in
the Coimtryside, Vol. II., No. 27, which says : — &amp;quot; In the case of a
Cuckoo&apos;s egg taken here this year, the bird had evidently solved
the problem of imitating colour as it was exactly the same shade
as the Hedge Sparrows&apos; in whose nest it was placed.&amp;quot; Eggs I
have seen taken from a Robin&apos;s nest in almost the identical spot
for three seasons running were a bluish green, faintly speckled
with brown, and I have been told that this type is the usual one
found in Hedge Sparrow&apos;s nests, but I have seen too few to form
any opinion, and to me these eggs appeared like a bluish variety
of the Robins. In Europe the list of a Cuckoo&apos;s victims have
been enumerated at 146. Among its commonest victims in
Britain are : — Hedge Sparrow, Robin, Reed Warbler, Meadow
Pipit, Garden Warbler, Sedge Warbler and Pied Wagtail. From
a large series of Cuckoo&apos;s eggs, 373 in number, 74 of these were
foisted on the Hedge Sparrow (Countiyside, Vol. II., No. 27).
The rarest victims selected are : — Blackbird, Swallow, Song
Thrush, Bullfinch, Chaffinch and Nightingale. Mr. T. Hope,
writing to the Countryside^ o\. III., No. 61, says : — &amp;quot; On May 4th,
we saw two young Blackbirds dead on the ground. On looking
into the nest we found a Cuckoo&apos;s egg resembling a Blackbird&apos;s.&amp;quot;
Mr. L. B. Mouritz fi?i lit) says a Cuckoo&apos;s egg was found in the
nest of a Sonar-Thrush in Richmond Park. This was given on

the authority of a Mr. Rillman, Superintendent of the Park.
Mr. Mouritz also kindly sent me the following notes of nests
personally known to himself that contained Cuckoo&apos;s eggs: —
Chaffinch (Reigate, 17/5/1S84 and &apos;93). Willow Wren and
Nightingale. There are also two records of Cuckoo&apos;s eggs in
Pheasant&apos;s nests {Countryside, Vol. II., No. 30). These of course
were a gross mistake on the part of the Cuckoo and may be
dismissed without further comment. I myself on two occasions
have found eggs laid on the ground ; the birds that laid them
probably being disturbed just after. The earliest and latest
Cuckoo&apos;s eggs that I can find any record of, is April 21st
(A. P. Macklin) and July 7th (Co2intryside,Mo\. III., No. 36). A
Cuckoo before depositing her egg will frequently eject all the
other eggs in the nest, and a deserted nest has frequently been
found to contain a Cuckoo&apos;s egg. It has been found that Cuckoo&apos;s
eggs deposited in the nests of Chaffinch, Bullfinch, Chiff-chaff,
and Nightingale do not resemble those of the fosterer&apos;s and the
explanation to this is that the Cuckoo, unable to find a suitable
nest, is forced to place it in one of these rather than none at
all. Mr. A. P. Macklin writes: — . ... &amp;quot;I found the nest of a
Hedge Sparrow, and a few yards beyond, that of a Garden
Warbler both containing incomplete clutches of eggs. On re-
visiting the spot some days later I found that the Garden
Warbler&apos;s nest had disappeared, but in that of the Hedge
Sparrow, a Cuckoo&apos;s egg of the most pronounced type but still
unmistakably a Cuckoo&apos;s egg had been deposited. It is
reasonable to assume that this was intended for and would have
been placed in the Garden Warbler&apos;s nest had this not in the
meantime disappeared. A close observer, Mr. Anthony Collett,
writes : — &amp;quot; There is another theory that Cuckoos are split up into
a number of families or clans, each of which is attracted to some
particular species of small bird, and the eggs laid by the Cuckoo
specially resemble the eggs of the small bird in question. This,
on the whole seems very probable, though it is unlikely that the
hen Cuckoo never drops her egg into a different sort of nest to
the one in which she herself was brought up in.&amp;quot;
Does the male Cuckoo first find the nest in which the
female is to place her egg? To this query personally I believe

the male does direct the female to the spot. Cuckoos, as is well-
known, in flight so closely resemble a Sparrow Hawk that only
a practised eye can distinguish the two. Now all small birds
naturally regard the Sparrow Hawk as their worst enemy and
never let slip an opportunity for mobbing it on every possible
occasion, (this by the way may be a special provision of nature to
enable the Hawk to catch its prey the easier, for sometimes the
Hawk will turn round and itself become the master of the situation
and carry off one of its tormentors), and seeing a male Cuckoo
would not be able to distinguish it from a Hawk and in conse-
quence mob it. Now let us suppose the male Cuckoo has found a
-suitable nest of say a pair of Pied Wagtails. He will haunt the
spot until the}&apos;- catch a sight of him and promptly pursue him.
Now the female&apos;s chance comes ; while her mate is leading off the
Wagtails on a &amp;quot; wild goose chase,&amp;quot; she, finding the coast clear,
deposits her egg- The Indian Cuckoo, the Koel alluded to above
deposits its eggs in the nest of the House-Crow (Corvus splendens).
These Cuckoos are not coloured alike as in our bird, but on the
■contrary are totally different in plumage, the male being coal
black, the female being brown and spotted. Every resident in
India who has ever paid any attention to bird life there cannot
Iiave failed to see how cordially detested is the male Koel by
the Corvine tribe, though no notice is taken of the female. The
male in this case leads off the Crows while the female deposits
her egg.
It may be as well to state that a typical Cuckoo&apos;s egg is a
trifle smaller than that of a Skylark, and though differing greatly
in colour is pretty uniform in shape and may be described
as a blunt oval. Specimens I have personally handled showed
little or no gloss, but this was probably due to their being fresh ;
incubated eggs are often exceedingly glossy and those of the
Nightingale in particular. Dresser gives the average size of a
Cuckoo&apos;s egg as •88ins. + &apos;651118. For the size of the bird the
egg is very small, thus of course rendering transit in the bill
an easy matter.
Does the influence of the male have anything to do with
the colour of the egg? Mr. Milburn {Countryside, Vol. III., No.
67), sa}&apos;s : &amp;quot; That the male bird has some influence in the colour

of the egg I am inclined to believe from the following instance.
Every year a Hawfinch&apos;s nest is to be found on a particular fork
of an apple tree near here, and the eggs, always three in number,
are of a peculiar heavily-streaked type. As the species is rather
too abundant from the owner&apos;s point of view the female is shot
off the nest as soon as she begins to sit. Still the remaining
male finds a fresh mate, and the same place is chosen, the same
compliment of eggs laid, and they are always of the same type
in the following season. This has been repeated this last six
years, and the Hawfinch is a good test because the eggs of
different pairs are usually varied. Is it not possible that this
influence of the male may have something to do with the
variation of the eggs of the Cuckoo ? The female most likely
has four or five different husbands in a season, and it is possible
that a male reared from a Wagtail&apos;s nest and the similar type of
egg would be chosen when the hen has a Wagtail&apos;s nest ready for
consideration. The same applies to other common foster parents.
This suggestion I know gives the female extraordinary powers of
discrimination, but it is the only one that will account for the
fact that one can obtain five or six different types of cuckoo&apos;s
eggs in districts where, at most, only two females frequent the
place as far as one can observe.&amp;quot;
The Charterhouse Museum at Godalming possesses a
splendid collection of Cuckoos&apos; eggs, and amongst the fosterers
they do not resemble are : Willow Wren, Wren, Spotted Fly-
catcher, Yellow Bunting, three clutches of Chaffinches, Green-
finch and Tree Pipit. I also find among the same collection
another blue egg, but there is no name to the fosterer, and, as far
as I could judge, these were probably Redstarts. These were
taken in Finland.
The food of the Cuckoo is chiefly composed of caterpillars,
especially those known under the general name of &amp;quot; woolly bear,&amp;quot;
and Dresser says it will also eat snails and seeds. The flight is
extremely swift, and before alighting a peculiar loud swishing
sound is produced by the wings. Cuckoos as a rule generally
haunt a particular area, and I have known a male frequent a
small space for three seasons. Of course this may not have been
the same bird, but the fact remains that a Cuckoo was alwaysTo^

be found there, and it is quite reasonable to suppose it to be the
same.
During wet and cold weather it calls little or not at all, and
I have frequently heard it at night, this being when the weather
was very hot. &amp;quot; He cries as he flies,&amp;quot; say country people, and 011
alighting always prefaces his well known cry with a deep chuck-
ling note, and at times only the first syllable is pronounced
several times without the last being uttered at all. It was Jenner
who first drew attention to the newly-hatched Cuckoo ejecting its
foster brothers and sisters from the nest. The late Charles
Waterton, who was rather given to criticising — and not always
correctly — the statements of other naturalists, ridiculed the idea.
Nevertheless, Jenner was perfectly correct, as has since been
proved by actual photographs taken of the young Cuckoo in the
act of doing so.
There is one instance on record of the Cuckoo hatching its
own eggs,- f and it is probable that at times young Cuckoos, after
leaving the nest are tended by the true mother or other Cuckoos ;
but this wants confirming. Since writing the above I have found
a Cuckoo&apos;s egg in a Hedge Sparrow&apos;s nest that would — except, of
course for its larger size — have exactly matched that of a Pied
Wagtail, and in my own mind have no doubt it was originally
intended for the Wagtail&apos;s nest, but the Cuckoo failing to find one
dropped it in the first convenient nest she came across.
There are many good and competent ornithologists who
are against the theory of a Cuckoo matching its eggs with those
of the fosterer, and it is only fair to state in favour of these that
a good many eggs do not match, as will be seen by some of the
above notes; but putting these together with those that do, the
latter outnumber the former, and possible solutions to this may
be: (1) that the Cuckoo may not always find a suitable nest in
which to deposit the egg, or (2) that it is only at a comparatively
recent period that the Cuckoo has realised the importance of
matching its eggs with those of its victims. I am aware that
this is again mere hypothesis and may sound weak, but for want
of a better explanation I am forced to suggest this. The whole

thing is very puzzling, and unless some more definite solution is
forthcoming how can one account for &amp;quot; the delicate pencilling
seen on the eggs of Chaffinch, Goldfinch, and others being
closely imitated&amp;quot;? I cauuot bring myself to think that this is
merely accidental and fully believe that, by some mysterious
instinct, the Cuckoo tries as far as possible to match her eggs
with those of the bird into whose nest they are deposited.
Though there are no less than four species of Cuckoos included
in the &amp;quot;British list&amp;quot; only one of these — the bird under present
consideration — is truly indigenous to our islands, and one of
whom many idle and vulgar tales have been told. Last summer
I was gravely informed by a man of good education that the
Cuckoo turned into a Hawk in the winter, and I believe this
superstition is current among country people.
It is interesting to note that many of the birds&apos; names in
the vernacular are derived from its cry. I quote Dresser: Cozicou

The range of the Cuckoo is given as the whole of Europe
to a little beyond the Arctic circle; Africa as far South as Natal
and Damaralaud ; Madeira and the Canaries ; Asia from lat.
67 N., the Celebes and Eastwards to Japan. The breeding
quarters are in the North and central portions of its range and it
winters in the South. I have heard the Cuckoo in the Himalayas
at an elevation of 6,000 feet, and its familiar cry seemed strangely
out of place coming from the solitude of those vast and gloomy
forests, and carried one&apos;s thoughts back to green fields and
English woods.

EGG OF THE GREATER BIRD-OF-PARADISE.

During his visit to the Aru Islands in quest of living
Birds-of- Paradise, my father&apos;s collector, Mr. Charles Pratt, was
fortunate enough to procure an egg of Paradisea apoda, which
the natives brought to him about December of last year.
Although identification was not absolute, there is no reason to
discredit the word of the natives, who positively asserted that
the egg in question belonged to the Greater Bird-of- Paradise.
As evidence that this tropical species has no regular breeding
season, it may be mentioned that an immature bird, perhaps two
months old, was brought to the collector about the same time.
The nest itself is apparently held in reverence by the natives and
the offering of a comparatively large reward failed to secure
one.
While the egg was being blown it was accideutly damaged
and it is now impossible to give its exact dimensions, but as
near as can be judged these are shown in the accompanying
illustration, the measurements being roughly 16 in. by i*iin.
The ground-colour is cream, while the bold splash-like streaks
radiating from the greater pole, are lavender grey and Vandyke
brown. The latter predominate and are the over-lying marks ;
these also occur in the form of smaller streaks and spots on
other parts of the shell.
Together with these notes I give a rough pencil sketch of
a female P. apoda, the first to reach Europe alive. Of course
there is no certain means of ascertaining its sex but there is
every indication that this bird is fully adult and therefore a female.
This statement is further corroborated by the natives who told
Mr. Pratt that, to experienced e}&apos;es the two sexes were at all
times distinguishable from one another owing to their slightly
different build. On the other hand the possibility of a mistake
suggests itself on account of the peculiar habits of this bird.
With the same cries it also goes through similar dancing displays
to those indulged in by the full-plumaged male. Readers of the
Aviculiural Magazine may expect to hear more about this and
other females as I believe my father shortly intends to write a
paper dealing with this subject.

Guttera cristata.
By L. M. Seth-Smith, B.A., M.B.O.U.
While in Unyoro (Uganda Protectorate) lately I was
engaged in making a survey for a new road between Masindi
and Butiaba, a port on the eastern shore of Lake Albert.
The old road passes through a corner of the Budougo
forest for a few miles, a forest teeming with objects of interest
to the naturalist. It is, however, almost all enclosed within the
boundaries of a game reserve, of which the old road is the
southern boundary. There are a few miles to the south of the
road where collecting is possible. When encamped near the
forest I made enquiries of the natives (as I usually do in a
locality new to me) about the game and birds to be found in
the forest, and among other information thus obtained, I was
told of a bird called Enkanga, which they said was something
like the common Guinea-fowl Enjiwiba {Numida ptilorhyncha).
Lunyoro, I may here remark, is one of the oldest of the
Bantu languages, and many of the Swahili words are borrowed
from it ; the Swahili word Kanga, which is used for the common
•Guinea-fowl, evidently being borrowed from the Lunyoro name
of this bird. I determined, if possible, to get some of these
birds, which the natives told me were very common in the forest ;
they also said that they sometimes caught them in their nets
when hunting a little bluish grey Duiker which is common
throughout the forest, so I told them to bring me the next they
caught, if possible, alive. Days went by and none were brought
.and I never happened to come across any myself, though now
and then I found blue-spotted feathers of some species of Crested
■Guinea-fowl. At last, after continually enquiring as to when
they were going to bring them, two were brought to me one
morning ; one dead and the other only just alive — this latter died
the same evening. This was disappointing, but at any rate I
was able to identify the species.
The natives told me that they had been out for several
•days trying to get them but had only just succeeded in doing so.
I ate these birds and found them most delicious, far fattef^antT

366 Mr. L. M. Seth-Smith,
more toothsome than their commoner relative, which is also
considered a delicacy.
The next day another was brought me by a man who,
wiser than the majority, had set nooses and so obtained the
whole of my reward for himself, instead of having it divided
among five or six others, as in the case of the first two brought
in. Now came the question of a cage, and as I was staying in
each camp for about a week, I determined to make a big tem-
porary one at each camp, in which the bird could have plenty of
room and also perch at night ; so I sent my men out for a lot of
straight sticks, about five feet long, which were stuck into the
ground about an inch apart, enclosing an area some five or six
feet square. The top was then thatched. The whole thing took
perhaps two hours to make and was an ideal place for the bird,
with room for others if more were brought.
I afterwards simplified this by obtaining a native hunting
net some twelve yards long and eight feet high, which I put
round four corner posts, thus saving time; but I always pre-
ferred the first method as it was stronger, and I found that white
ants soon attacked the netting. At the same time I knocked
together a large box cage for carrying the bird in.
What struck me most was the wonderful tameness of this
bird, which would take food from my hand the first day, even
when in this large cage, and also its charming little chatter when
feeding, which sounded to me like &amp;quot; That&apos;s good — that&apos;s good.&amp;quot;
Its method of showing annoyance was by putting its head down
close to the object which displeased it and hissing, also frequently
pecking.
The bird was slightly lame when brought in, evidently the
result of the noose by which it had been caught, but was soon
quite well again. A day or so later another was brought and I
paid for it, but I found out afterwards that this one had been
stolen from a noose set by another man, so the wrong man was
paid for it. This bird also was lame but I hoped it would soon
get all right again. They got on very well together, both being
perfectly tame and feeding well, but the second bird, a hen I
fancy, never put the lame foot to the ground always hopping
about and perching on one foot. I afterwards found that the leg.

was broken, and it struck me as a wonderful thing that the bird
could get on so well and be so tame under these conditions, more
especially when it is remembered that these birds in their native
forests are of the shiest possible nature, being seldom seen,
although I believe very common where they occur.
The feeding was a difficult matter at first as insects were
very scarce, however I found that they took readily to raw meat
mixed with biscuit, and on this diet I managed to keep them,
giving insects when I could find them and occasionally hard-
boiled egg. I could not get them to touch native corn.
One incident I should like to mention to illustrate the
tameness of this species after three weeks of captivity. I was
sitting in my tent one morning and my boy, who was feeding
them, stupidly left the door open for a moment. I happened to
look out and saw one of these birds strolling quietly about 07it-
side, picking up a scrap of food here and there, perfectly happy,
and all the while chattering to himself. I immediately went out,
telling some of my men who came running up to go away again,
and walked slowly round the bird which by this time had wan-
dered some twenty yards from his cage. I gradually drove this
full-winged bird back and he entered without the least difficulty.
Besides the hissing and chattering, the call note, which is
usually uttered morning and evening, is very pretty, beiugalmost
bell-like, and is repeated rapidly six times with a short interval
between the second and third notes ; these six notes are repeated
several times, and then the call is sometimes ended by a screech,
but this ending is very often omitted.
To cut a long story short, I brought one of these birds
home with me, the other died on the voyage, much to my regret.
The bird is now in a large aviary but still quite tame,
coming inside as soon as it hears the door being opened, and
taking any tit-bit from my hand.
Its favourite food now consists of cockroaches, but it also
picks up a lot of seed and I have several times seen it swallow
large worms with great relish.
It is really a charming bird and should be easily
domesticated. There should be no difficulty in- importing them
from West Africa where they are, I believe, common^though
possibly not easily obtained.

The general colour of the bird is black with blue spots,
which on the primaries run together forming blue lines. The
outer edges of the secondaries are white. Round the base of the
neck and on the chest there is a wide collar of pure black. The
head and neck are bare except for a fine crest of curly black
feathers and are of a dark slaty colour, the chin and throat being
red. The skin at the back of the neck is folded in a curious
manner and looks like a piece of ribbon tied round the bird&apos;s
neck. On the throat also, the red skin is folded on each side
looking not unlike large wattles.

By Dr. A. G. Butler.
In his introductory notes to the Class Aves (Birds of North
and Middle America, vol. I, pp. i, 2) Prof. Ridgway observes : —
&amp;quot;There are two essentially different kinds of ornithology,
systematic or scientific, and popular. The former deals with the
structure and classification of birds, their synonymies and
technical descriptions. The latter treats of their habits, songs,
nesting, and other facts pertaining to their life-histories.
Although apparently distinct from one another, these two
branches of ornithologj&apos; are in reality closely related and to a
degree interdependent. The systematist who does not possess
an intimate knowledge of the habits of birds, their mode of
nidification, the character of their nests, eggs, and young, is
poorly equipped for the work he has in hand, while the popular
writer who is ignorant of scientific ornithology and who neglects
to keep in touch with its progress is placed at an equal
disadvantage — his writings may entertain, but are far more apt
to mislead, through erroneous statements, than educate. Popular
ornithology is the most entertaining, with its savor of the
wildwood, green fields, the riverside and seashore, bird songs,
and the many fascinating things connected with out-of-door
Nature. But systematic ornithology, being a component part of
biology — the science of life — is the more instructive and there-
fore more important. Each advance in this serious study reveals
just so much more of the hidden mysteries of creation, and adds
proportionately to the sum of human knowledge.&amp;quot;

While the above statements evidence a breadth of view
unusual amongst the majority of systematic Ornithologists, at
the same time they are only an expression of the individual judg-
ment of a first-class systematist : and the implication that the
stud}&apos;- of bird-life is unscientific, because fascinating, and the
study of dead birds is scientific because it necessitates close
study and mental fag, is to my mind unsound and illogical.
Science is the acquisition of knowledge, in fact it is
knowledge ; and whatever secrets of Nature we discover, whether
they deal with the external or internal anatomy, or whether they
deal with the habits of an animal, are of scientific value. But
there is this difference between the work of the student of life
and the student of death ; the former deals with facts and facts
only (though he may theorize as a result of his discoveries); he
deals direct with Nature and truth, and what he records, if he be
an accurate observer, is immutable and a definite gain to science ;
the latter also deals with facts, but interprets them according to
his own judgment ; and thus often misleads subsequent workers.
In some cases a single structural peculiarity is assumed to be all-
important, and a classification built up upon that alone, and later
on it is discovered that this peculiarity is variable ; then the
little brick castle is demolished and another is built on an
entirely different plan.
Systematic Ornithology is akin to an effort of the finite
to compass the infinite (an admirable exercise in which we are
doubtless fated to indulge into the ewigkeit). Without the Aves of
the world, since they first came into existence until the present
time, to study from ; no absolute certainty can ever be attained
to respecting the evolution of existing types : we may have con-
victions and form shrewd opinions, but we can never know for
certain.
The study of classification is quite as fascinating in its
way as the study of habits, and each succeeding strenuous worker
probably gets a little nearer to the truth ; but the careful
observer of the living creature starts with the truth, and keeps
on building up a structure of facts which cannot be overthrown.
Is his labour then less scientific because it is not subject to man&apos;s
criticism and unalterable, because it is a definite gain to hlmrarT

370 Dr. A. G. Butler,
knowledge? — I trow not. The single item of bird-food, because
of the extent to which it affects agriculture, and consequently
the well-being of man and beast, is of the highest scientific
importance.
Aviculture, or the study of bird-life in aviaries and cages,
is a necessary adjunct to the study of the wild life ; to those of
us who are not able to wander over the face of the earth, it is the
only way in which we can discover many facts relating to the
birds of other lands : even those who do travel are often unable
to study the life-history of a bird on account of its skulking
habits, whereas in a suitable aviary there is no difficulty what-
ever.
Of course all aviculturists do not take up the study of
birds in a scientific spirit ; many of them merely take pleasure
in keeping them because they are charming ornaments for the
home ; but this fact does not prove that Aviculture in its highest
sense is unscientific. Many of the truths affecting the synoi^my,
the nidification, the courting, the tendency to polygamy or
polyandry, the duration of incubation, and the sexual characters
of birds, which aviculturists have brought to light, should be of
the greatest scientific interest even to a systematise
Dr. E. Hartert says that &amp;quot; Aviculture is generally a hobby,
and a very interesting one, but not strictly a branch of science,
although sometimes scientific questions have been and will be
solved by its means, especially when experiments are made with
that purpose.&amp;quot; (Proceedings of Fourth Int. Orn. Congr. p. 266).
The same may be truthfully said of systematic work : the
majority of those who take up the various branches of Natural
History do so for the sake of a hobby ; some of them, like the
keepers of living birds, are mere collectors and only visit
Museums in order to find out the names of their specimens, but
among these private collectors are men who are fully as scientific
and methodical as any Museum curator.
Dr. Hartert says that &amp;quot; Ornithology has advanced further
than many other branches of zoology.&amp;quot; Is this so ? Can the
systematic Ornithologist sex all his skins at sight as the
Eutomologist does his insects? If so, why is it that there are
more uusexed than sexed skins in collections? A science which

has not advanced far enough to enable its votaries to sex speci-
mens by external characters, but is dependant upon the more
or less reliable statement of the taxidermist who skinned the
specimen, can hardly be said to have got ahead of man}&apos; other
branches of zoology. In this item of knowledge of external
sexual characters the aviculturist has advanced further than the
systematise and therefore in that branch of his legitimate study
has proved himself the more scientific worker.
Without doubt the system of careful measurements adopted
in the United States National Museum is doing much towards
throwing light upon sexual differences ; but, without knowledge
of the exact ages of the birds which are measured, that light
must be greatly obscured. We know that nestling birds have a
very wide gape and that the breadth of the bill gradually narrows
with age. This narrowing process has not ceased at the time of
the first moult, when many birds acquire their adult plumage ; at
this time also the young have not attained their full length, but
are noticeably smaller than their parents : now it is quite con-
ceivable that the young birds from the same nest might all fall
to the gun of a collector in one State, and when compared with
adult birds from another State might be described as a distinct
sub-species on the score of their smaller size and shorter
broader bills.
This being so, the more species that can be bred and
studied in captivity, the better will the systematic student be
equipped for comprehending the meaning of the various measure-
ments in his cabinet specimens. Without the assistance which
such information as the breeder might supply, the only chance
for the systematist, when searching for sexual differences, is to
pick out and compare the largest sexed examples from the
same locality.
Any addition to the knowledge of man is science : for any
man to assert that his work is scientific and the other man&apos;s is
not, when both are helping to educate the public, is unreasonable ;
his work may be tnore irksome and brain-wearing, but it is not
more scientific on that account.

NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.

<bodyText confidence="0.999271725" page_id="33229422"  page_num="372" year="" vol="">
Sir, — I am delighted to learn that so many of the American birds
which I sent to the London Zoo. arrived there safely. It is an honor
nowadays to be instrumental in adding a new species to the long list of
those which have made their home in that well-known institution, and I
was indeed surprised when I saw from the list in the Avicultural Magazine
that no fewer than eighteen were formerly unrepresented. A word as to
these birds may be of interest to those of yonr readers who have not had
the opportunity of observing them in the United States.
They comprise the commonest migrants in our Eastern States, and it.
seems at first inexplicable that they should be unknown in English
collections. The reason is easy to imagine however. From the multitudes
of English birds which reach us through dealers, and from the notices
which appear in the papers, every third country man and boy on your
Island seems to be an expert trapper, while with us, not one fanner or boy
in ten thousand knows how to trap a bird, or to feed it after he takes it
from the nest. He knows only how to shoot it. All the collections of
living birds in the United States have been chiefly of foreign species, with
native birds absent or sparsely represented, and now, stringent laws wisely
forbid the keeping of native birds by private individuals.
The collection of native birds in the New York Zoological Park is
without doubt the largest ever made in the country, and with its exhaustive
labelling is of the greatest economic value in teaching thousands of people
the usefulness of birds and the advisability of protecting them. Even the
making of this collection was no exception to the rule of the superiority of
the English in trapping, for part of it is due to the keenness and skill of an
English keeper.
Our native Warblers have never been kept in confinement until within
the last two years, so I was especially glad to be able to send representatives
of this family, the Mniotiltidce, of which we Americans think so highly.
May I suggest that you have made an error in the naming of the Oven-bird,
Dendroica discolor being the small and very different Prairie Warbler, while
the correct name for the Oven-bird is Seiurus aurocapiltus (Linn.). Although
only four species of warblers were sent, they are well representative of the
wonderful adaptive radiation of this unusual family ; the Yellow Warbler
being perhaps typical; the Redstart showing the habits, broad mandibles
and bristles of a Flycatcher, and the Water-Thrush with the wading habits
and teetering motion of a Sandpiper.
Our Chickadee looks strange to our eyes under his new name of
Titmouse, but as our English ancestors first called him Chickadee there is
no reason why Englishmen of to-day should not replace it with another if

they see fit ! But, joking aside, I am truly glad to see you use our name of
Robin, prefixed by American. There is no reason why every laud should
not have its Robin, and ours is as dear to us under that name as your
smaller, sprightlier Redbreast is to you. However, from the standpoint at
least of scientific names, we in this country can throw no stones. In the
case of Robin : Turdus, long before I can remember, gave place to Merula r
by which name I have always known it; lately, in the twinkling of an eye,
that is replaced by the strange, uncouth Planisticus. Whether this will be
valid to-morrow morning remains with our too energetic taxouomists —
Quien sabe? perhaps it may swing back to Turdus again. Hence our
affection for the vulgar but far more stable name Robin !
I regret that the ornithologists of every nation cannot agree on some
universal system of nomenclature and specific naming, for the benefit of
those of us whose love for the bird itself and its life exceeds the desire to-
make of its name more than a convenient handle — a means to an end — not
vice versa. C. William Beebe,
Curator of Ornithology,
Neiv York Zoological Park.
BRONZE x MAGPIE MANNIKIN HYBRIDS.
Sir, — The rearing of this cross has occurred in my aviary from the
chance pairing of odd birds. The nest was so dark and deep that I do not
know how many eggs were laid, neither are there aiiy leavings of other
eggs in the nest. This may be accounted for by the fact that the young
bird reared left the nest while I was away on my holidays, and there are
several species in the aviary that soon clear away any eggs they can get at.
The parent birds now take no interest in the nest whatever.
The young bird has been out of the nest for ten days : it is a little
larger than its male parent, and is quite of a nondescript appearance, being
of a dark umber-browu above, washed with chocolate colour on the upper
back, and of a light umber-browu below, with a suspicion of fawn at the
base of the feathers. I believe this is the first time this cross has been
reared. Wesley T. Page.

Sir, — Having for many years been puzzled at the rapid change which
takes place in the Fjeld Ryper (Ptarmigan) in late autumn, from brown to
pure white, I wrote last October to a Norwegian, a man I have known for
many years, whose life is mostly spent in the woods, asking him to procure
me some Ryper in the condition of the winter change from brown to white
feathers. On the 1st of December 1906 the man wrote as follows: &amp;quot;I did
procure six birds for you, but the brown feathers were so loose that they all
fell off themselves, so I have sold the birds as I thought it useless to send
them.&amp;quot; This is clear oroof of an autumn moult.

Norwegians tell me that the hare turns white by losing the brown
coat, and that the Eider Duck also moults the coloured feathers to grow
white ones.
I have had various Pheasants this summer: the young are beginning
to put on tinges of gold in patches, and the pen is full of their moulted
feathers; no adults are in the pen with them. Rose Haig Thomas.
TURD US MURINUS.
Sir, — I have once more had the audacity to correct the authorities at
the Zoological Gardens ! Having lately purchased a Thrush brought over from
Guiana as Turdus phceopygus (Mr. Harper who brought it is in no wa}&apos; to
blame for the mistake) and having examined the bird and compared it with
the coloured plates in Seebohm&apos;s splendid work, &amp;quot;The Monograph of the
Thrushes,&amp;quot; I come to the conclusion that it is T. murinus, not T. phosopygus.
Having also seen a Thrush, of the same species as my own, in the
Western Aviary at the Gardens, labelled as T. phosopygus, I ventured [what
will the Superintendent say?!] to write to Dr. Chalmers Mitchell to
suggest that the said Thrush had been misnamed.
Dr. Chalmers Mitchell at once wrote to say that he would have the
bird examined, and a few days afterwards I received this reply : — &amp;quot; I have
&amp;quot; sent over the Thrush to the British Museum for Dr. Bowdler Sharpe to
*&apos; see it. He agrees with you that it is 1\ murinus, although not quite a
&amp;quot; normal specimen.&amp;quot;
I might add that 7&apos;. phosopygus is a Thrush with much more russet
coloured upper parts than T. murinus, and also with the stripes running
from the base of the bill down the throat much more denned, ending in a
white patch beneath them. 7&apos;. murinus is of a more olive brown on the
upper parts, the stripes on the throat are considerably fainter, and there is
no white patch at the base of them.
T. murinus rather resembles a female Blackbird. Anyone not well
up in the Thrush family would, on first sight, put it down as such.
The bird that I have promises to be a very good songster, for although
he is moulting he gives forth \sotto voce] some very sweet notes.
Mr. Harper very courteously offered to take the Thrush back if it
proved not to be T. phosopygus, but I am quite content with it as it is.

TREATMENT OF WOOD-SWALLOWS.

<bodyText confidence="0.987034" page_id="33229424"  page_num="374" year="" vol="">
Sir, — Would you be so kind as to advise me on the treatment of
some Wood-Swallows I have just had sent to me.
I conclude these birds are Shrikes and so at present I am feeding
them on a mixture of crushed sweet biscuit, dry ants&apos; eggs, dried flies, and
egg-flake moistened, also about two or three mealworms each a day, and
three times a week a very little raw meat grated into the insect food.

I have never kept this class of bird before, so am uncertain about the
number of mealworms that can be given and the amount of raw meat, also
whether the meat should be given daily or not.
Should any green food be given ? E. J. Brook.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Brook :
The Wood-Swallows are generally admitted to be related to the
Drongos: they have also been regarded by various writers as relatives of the
true Swallows, the Orioles, and the Starlings. You must not decide upon
their food by their relationship to the Drongo-Shrikes, although in their
wild state the latter feed chiefly if not entirely upon insects.
The natural food of Wood-Swallows consists chiefly of living insects,
but it is possible that they may also feed upon soft fruits and honey, both
of which they are fond of in captivity. Any good insectivorous food, such
as &amp;quot;Century Food&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Improved Sekto &amp;quot; would be suitable as a staple :
soft fruit should be added, but I should not advise honey on account of its
sticky nature; living insects need only be given occasionally, especially if
only mealworms are available. Do not give raw meat, it is sure to cause
diarrhoea. A. G. Butler.

<bodyText confidence="0.978801647058823" page_id="33229425"  page_num="375" year="" vol="">
Sir, — As shortly I am obtaining a pair of Quail-finches and Harle-
quin Quails, I should be obliged if you would let me know if it is proper to
feed the former on white millet and canary and the latter on the same with
occasionally split peas and lettuce.
When acclimatised, are these two species hardy enough to winter in
an outdoor aviary ? Nicholas O&apos;Reilly.
The following reply has bee?i sent to Mr. O&apos;Reilly :
Quail-finches require white, Indian and spray millet, canary seed and
flowering grass. They should always have access to grass, and if kept in a
cage, should he supplied with a fresh turf every two days or so. They
should also have access to a piece of rock-salt. They are not particularly
hardy, and would not be likely to stand the winter in an unheated outdoor
aviary.
Harlequin Quails are quite hardy and may be kept all the year
round in an outdoor aviary. They should have access to plenty of grass
and be fed on canary and millet seed. Do not forget a piece of rock-salt.

Sir, — One reads articles and letters from time to time in various

•wish to possess, but, according to my limited experience, it is practically-
impossible to obtain either it or the Prairie Hen.
Having a friend in the States (both a business man and a sportsman)
I wrote to him a few months since to iuvestigate matters, and try to get me
some of these. He set to work and sent me amass of correspondence from
Game Commissioners, Naturalists, Officers of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, Bird Dealers, etc., all pointing to this, namely that the Ruffed
■Grouse and Prairie Hen were so scarce it was almost impossible to obtain
them, and further that the laws of most of the States prohibit exportation.
I should be delighted to hear that the information is erroneous, but
I fear not.
Before it is too late cannot some enterprising member of the
Avicultural Society, with better means and knowledge for the purpose than
I possess, be persuaded to make a determined effort to obtain a few of
these birds for breeding in England ? The legal difficulty in America could
be got over by license or otherwise.
It is believed the birds would do well under suitable conditions in
this country, and, if once a stock were obtained, the result would surely be
■worth the initial trouble and expense.
I would readily subscribe to a fund if anything can be done.
Matters move fast in America, and soon I fear it will be too late.

NESTING HABITS OF THE LITTLE GREBE.

<bodyText confidence="0.9460049" page_id="33229426"  page_num="376" year="" vol="">
Sir, — On May the 19th last, I saw a Little Grebe {Podicipes fluviatelis)
-sitting 011 a small and weedy pond a few yards from the bank. To the best
of my knowledge she had been sitting there at least a week. On my
revisiting the place on July 1st, I found to my surprise the bird was still
sitting on the same nest. Surely this could not have been the first lot of
■eggs ? Does the Little Grebe use the same nest for the second lot of eggs ?
I had always understood another nest was made for these. Any in formation
on this point I should be very grateful for, as I have before sent this query
to another magazine which has altogether ignored it:
