The Society's Medal.
RULES.
The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a
detailed account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the
date of hatching of the young and furnish such evidence of the facts as the
Executive Committee may -require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases
where the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young and be
of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal is
under consideration.
The parents of the young must be the bona fide property of the breeder. An
evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the breeder
from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will seriously prejudice
any other claims he or she may subsequently advance for the breeding of the same
or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2^ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society -- founded 1891." On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to ( name of recipient) for rearing the young of ( name of
species) a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

A writer in a recent issue of our paper asks why it is that no
aviculturist has attempted to breed our English Water Rail. I think
that the answer to that is--the extreme difficulty there is in pro-
curing these birds, and more especially in true pairs. I have never
seen them advertised by either bird-catchers or dealers, and doubt
whether they frequently come into their hands. It is possible that
some of the old-time watermen may occasionally take one or two
when snaring snipe, but these they would probably consign with the
latter to the London game dealers. Having very suitable aviaries for
this kind of bird, I should be pleased to secure a pair and try to
breed them ; but although there are always one or two on the stream
that supplies my aviary ponds, I see no chance of getting hold of
them. I have kept several varieties of Rails and Gallinules, and
have found most of them very interesting. My first were a pair of
those extremely beautiful birds, the Purple Gallinule (P. porphyrio).
At that time I had no large aviaries, and was forced to keep them in
one about 15 ft. square, with a small pond in one corner. They were
a very steady pair, and would, I have no doubt, have nested had I
kept them, but, like most of their kind, they were murderously
inclined, and would soon have exterminated the smaller occupants of
their enclosure, so I was reluctantly compelled to dispose of them. I
should like now to get them back. My next venture was with a pair
of Greyheaded Gallinules (P. poliocephahis), a slightly smaller bird

than the one last mentioned, having the head and neck grey and the
rest of the body purple. These were great climbers, and spent a
good deal of their time in the branches of the trees and shrubs that
were growing in their enclosure. They made no attempt to breed
whilst in my possession, but neither did they molest the other birds
kept with them. Both these varieties were very fond of dead mice,
which at that time were unpleasantly numerous in all my aviaries,
and a day seldom passed without their having one or two for break-
fast. They were also keen on lettuce and similar green-stuff. Their
other food was principally the waste seed from the other birds'
tables, so that they were easy to cater for. These are large birds,
and so are not suitable for the ordinary aviculturist, but since then I
have had several smaller varieties that might easily be kept in most
aviaries, and would be quite likely to breed. The most attractive of
these both in looks and manners is my Amazon Bail. I don't know
its scientific name, but it is possible that some of your readers may
be able to name it for me.* In general body-colour it is rufous, the
neck and face bluish-grey, top of head rufous, tail and abdomen
black, legs carmine, bill greenish-yellow, eye very prominent and
rich ruby red. Size about as our Moorhen. Two came over, but one
escaped when in the hands of the dealer. My bird is absolutely
tame, and loves to be petted. Its call is an extremely clear whistle :
Pip-pop! Pip-pop! Pip-pop-pop-pop! many times repeated. It is
quite as loud or louder than the whistle of our Curlew, and could be
heard I should think even further. It will always sing to order for
my wife or children, but the writer it greets with a few low grunts,
which have a weird effect when coming from the centre of a thick
growth of water-weeds. This winter it met with a disaster, getting
its feet and legs frost-bitten. We did everything possible for it,
amongst other things giving it iodine baths for several weeks, but all
was without avail. One morning I found that one of its legs had
broken off, so as the other seemed likely to follow suit I amputated
it. The stumps quickly healed, and it is now as well as ever, except
that its body is some six inches nearer the ground than formerly. It
gets about very well, but it is not now able to run races with my

children, which, when it was full-limbed, it was fond of doing. Not
one of them could get away from it then. This winter I shall see
that it has shelter when the cold weather sets in. Another charming
little bird that I still have is the African Black Rail ( Limnocorax
niger). This bird is about the size of our Water Rail, but stands
higher on the legs. In colour it is a rich velvety black, with carmine
legs and a primrose-coloured bill; eye rich red. Although not so
tame as its Amazon cousin, it is by no means shy, and can be
generally seen at any time of the day, and in my few spare moments
this summer I have had much pleasure from watching its pretty
ways and habits. Its call is a kind of laughing grunt, but it has
various other croaks and chuckles. The dealer from whom I got it
offered me a pair, but on their arrival I found that one of them was
the African Dwarf Moorhen ( Gallinula angulata). Unfortunately this
little bird was evidently damaged on the way down, as it died the
next day. In colour it was almost an exact replica of our Moorhen,
having even the red leg-collar, but it was only half the size. It seems
strange that a dealer, with a reputation as a naturalist, should have
sent out such dissimilar birds as a true pair. The middle of June I
missed this little Rail for several days, and thought that it might be
incubating. True enough, a diligent search around the edges of its
pond revealed a neat little nest, well hidden in the long grass, and
containing five rather large eggs. These were cream-coloured, and
thickly covered with red spots, slightly denser at the larger end.
What a pity that she has not a mate ! Late last summer I got a pair
of American Moorhens, but neither lived very long. They are too
much like our own birds to make them very interesting. The
principal difference seemed to me to be an extra length of leg in the
American bird. The bare skin on the head of the male also appeared
to be larger. Much more interesting were a pair of little Brown
Gallinules from Central America that I obtained about the same
time, believed to be Porphyriola parva. These were of about half the
size of our Moorhens, and of much the same build. The bill,
however, was much heavier, being of the type of P. porphyrio. They
did very well with me for a time and I had great hopes of breeding
them this summer, but one morning I missed them, and found that
they had both, as well as a small Blue Rail from the same district,

escaped through the roof of their aviary. This was covered with 2-in-
netting, and I had no idea that they would be able to get through it.
Their bodies are much smaller than they look to be, and I have now
found that much larger birds can get through this size mesh with
ease. For some time the birds remained about in the neighbouring
villages, visiting the villagers' chicken-pens, and I had some hopes of
recovering them, but although stimulated by a promised reward j
none of the village boys succeeded in capturing them. My last
venture in this type of bird was with a trio of White-breasted Water-
hens from India. When they arrived I was much interested in them,
as they were not unduly shy, in the small aviary in which they were
first placed, and they were rather striking-looking birds, and I
thought that they would be likely to breed. But alas ! they have
proved very disappointing in the large aviary in which they are now
located. Here they have unlimited cover, with a nice pond sur-
rounded with flags and rushes. Their habits seemed to have entirely
altered. They skulk in the thick cover all day, and the only time
that I see them is when they visit the pond to drink and bathe in the
late evening. I understand that in India they nest in the late
summer, so there is still a chance that they may redeem their
character by doing so later on.*

The Finch family is well represented here. On January 1st
two pairs of bullfinches were seen in a village, the males looking
superb with their black caps, crimson breasts, and white rumps.
Later in February I watched a bullfinch, goldfinch, and chaffinch in
the same hedgerow, and could not help thinking the bullfinch sur-
passed the goldfinch in magnificence. But all bird-lovers must like
to know that the goldfinch is the commonest finch in this country.
* [Since writing the above the Black Bail has again nested. This time the nest
was suspended from the rushes, a foot or more above the water. The white-
breasted Waterhens have built a similar nest, but so far have not laid.]

Early in the year they fly about in clouds, and as they wheel
together the glint of gold in the bright sunlight is wonderful.
The chaffinches were in fine song, and reminded one forcibly
of home and the English summer. But on April 10th I have a note
that all chaffinches had disappeared, and none have been seen since.
In the middle of February it was my good fortune to see a haw-
finch close by our camp on the foothill. Its general chestnut hue
is a contrast to the other finches. The short, stout bill makes it
somewhat like a miniature parrot. I noted the black "bib" and
edge of wings, and the white, short tail, as it was very tame and
esaily approached. The great brown linnet is always with us ; it,
too, has the black marking on the breast. Its droning song resembles
somewhat that of the yellow-hammer, which, by the way, I have
never seen yet in Macedonia. A bird resembling the brown linnet
in shape, but smaller, is new to me. It is evidently a linnet, but
it has two lovely patches of crimson on sides of the breast.* Green
linnets were plentiful in the winter, hut, like the chaffinch, have
gone.
As this country has more hushes than trees--due, no doubt,
to wasteful habits of the natives or to the unrest which led the Turks
to destroy trees as possible cover for their enemies--the greenfinch
is much more visible than at home, where he always seems to me to
make himself heard, and not seen, from leafy hedgerows. Only twice
have I seen a hedge-sparrow, and that was on January 1st this year
and later on February 17th. Their absence was commented upon by
Dr. Lovell Keays, who is not far away on the same front.
Two kinds of doves are common here, and very tame--the
ring-doves, which I have kept at home and knew so well. How
interesting to see them wild, to note the curious noise of their wings
--the note resembling the sound made by blowing paper against a
comb--when they alight, and of course their cooing in the trees and
on the ruined cottages. The turtle-doves came much later. They
are tame too, so that one can observe the splendid blue and black
which emblazon the sides of the neck and hear the " turr-turr-turr "
* [Our male British Linnet has these two patches in a wild state during the breeding
season, and the forehead is of the same rose-red. It never acquires this
lovely colouring in a cage.-- Ed.]

Capt. Bernard E. Potter,
cooing. They arrived in flocks, but quickly paired, and now one
sees the newly fledged young. I have never yet seen a Quist, or
wood-pigeon, out here. Early in the year one can observe flocks
of blue pigeons with no ring on the neck. These I have thought
must be stock-doves ; they are not rock-pigeons.
The ring-doves --our domestic kind -- are common in Salonika,
and take the place of our London pigeons.
This morning, while out to put up notice boards indicating
our advanced dressing-station, I stopped to watch some gunners
fire cordite from their rifles into a stream to stun and catch fish
for culinary purposes. A good basketful was being obtained. But
during this I heard a note which has haunted me in Macedonia. The
sound was an oft-repeated " cuckoo " and " cuckookoe." This is a
monotone, and not the major, or even minor third of the cuckoo's
song. Sometimes I had thought this was a dove's note. It w 7 as a
naturalist's delight to unravel the mystery and to spot the bird, only
30 yards away, on the bough of a dead stunted tree--a fine hoopoe.*
I turned my field-glasses upon him, and let the gunner fishermen
enjoy the sight too. Even the most unemotional must like to watch
so quaint a bird with so rich a colouring, with its fine, long, black,
delicately curved bill; its buff head, with two black bars separated
by white upon the crown ; and the long thick crest of black with
white bar. During its song the neck would swell up to resemble a
goitre. Erom time to time it changed its position, and in flight the
black and white barred plumage shows to perfection. In profile the
short legs look comical. The length of the bill is especially notice-
able when used for preening the feathers.
At this same spot in the stream I heard the muffled croak of
a large green frog, which I saw in the rushes. Only a few moments
later did I discover that a water-snake-- a variety with yellow bands
along the sides and black under parts-- had seized the frog, whose
plaintive cries died away as it was slowly engulfed. The distended,
flattened head of the snake looked terrifying.
On April 10th, when searching a marsh for the whereabouts
of larvae of the perilous anopheles mosquito, a bittern flew up and

alighted upon a pollarded tree only 20 yards away. It seemed tame
enough, and did not resent my scrutiny. It was the first wild one
I had ever seen, and it looked like a dwarf heron. The long plumes
were of thin, light, and dark shade ; the general colour light sandy ;
wings and under parts white. In flight, head retracted and feet
extended. Bill is straight, stout, and long. Perhaps I may yet hear
" the bittern sound his drum, booming from the sedgy shallow."
More good fortune awaited me. The beautiful pied fly-
catcher appeared in the trees above the marsh, and the thrice-
repeated white and black from head to tail was noted; but from below
it was all white. Its actions in catching flies resembled exactly
those of our sober-plumaged spotted variety in that it would
frequently return to the same perch. Quite near the main stream
a kingfisher sat facing me, showing its rose-coloured breast.
The storks call for some comment. I saw them first on
March 23rd. They are majestic birds and thoroughly tame.
Chimneys in these shelled villages they have no use for, but the
many pollarded elms and poplars support their enormous nests. It
is an incongruous sight to see the birds poised on one leg upon
the nest. They have no fear of man; their nests are close above
the dug-outs and encampments. When one joins its mate, heads are
thrown backwards and forwards, and there is a loud, rapid clapping
of bills which can be heard a long way off. The lower parts of the
nest are used by jackdaws and sparrows, who are thereby saved
much labour. In these days of dearer fresh meat rations the stork s
jot is enviable; he can find an easy living in the many marshes
where the frogs abound, and day and night keep up the chorus of
Aristophanes, " brek, kek, kek, kek," and " koax, koax," each one
distending enormous transparent membranes, puffed out at the base
of the neck to the size of its own head. Yesterday I observed a stork
get up from dry ground with a great mole in its bill.
The varieties of the Raptores are very numerous ; in spite
of much questioning, few officers can help one. Dr. Lovell Keays,
whom I had the luck to meet at a field hospital, confessed that
identification is difficult. I have notes of some sixteen, which may
be of interest. The little kestrel is very common and tame, nesting
in the eaves of houses. The colours are, roughly, blue and crimson,

Capt. Bernard E. Potter,
the females being more of a brown hue. At Brigade Headquarters the
other day I came upon the Brigadier and his Major in shirt sleeves
lustily blowing eggs. On being asked, I readily identified the sandy-
brown but variable colours of our own kestrel's eggs. He called
the bird the Lesser Kestrel. The Editor and others now have settled
the name for a whitish-blue harrier we see much of--Montagu's
pallid harrier. There is no other bird like it. Another bird of
similar size and habits Hies irregularly low down and rapidly over
the bushes and hillocks, as if about to alight any moment. This
bird is very dark in colour, but has conspicuous white above the tail.
Also I recently observed that when seen at rest it has some white
marking on the front of the head.* * * S
Another large hawk I first observed a year ago above a village
on the Salonika hills. It swooped down a gully upon a wheatear,
which it would have caught, if undisturbed. It is of very dark brown
hue, but has definite white on cheeks or upper parts of neck.t High
aloft on several sunny days I have watched with glasses a soaring
eagle or buzzard, which is wholly white beneath except the wing
primaries, coverts, tail, and part of the head, which are black-
With still wings it glides for minutes at a time, but the head can
be seen turning about as if watching for some quarry. \
Late last year I watched a fight between a pair of lesser
kestrels and a larger hawk of chequered brown and yellow, as far as
could be detected. S Each tried to get above the other. Finally the
large bird got above, and both dived into a deep ravine. I dis-
mounted from my horse, and ran to the edge. There I saw the
kestrel beneath its large antagonist, which was pulling out feathers,
but flew off when it saw me. But the male kestrel remained still,
too exhausted or injured to move.
An eagle, frequently seen on the plain where I now am posted,
has a light-coloured head and light patches above the wings, as
noted when it turns in flight. But in the luxuriant deep vegetation,
when it alights on the ground, I have seen only the yellow top of

the head. It is a very large bird, but no dimensions could be
given.*
There is another large bird, all of a brown colour, which has
a long tail resembling that of a fish, with sharp outline. As it turns
in the air the tail is often seen to twist into a plane reverse to that
of the wings. Might this be one of the kites ? [Undoubtedly. Ed.]
The small Athene owl is very common. One delightfully
tame one remained with us in three camps, though at liberty. One
night I was awakened, when sleeping beneath trees in the open, by
this bird, which hopped on and off me, and allowed its feathers to be
stroked. The colours are brown, with white dots and streaks on the
wings. A large brown owl resembles our wood owl, but is of greater
size. I hear of the eagle-owl, but do not know it. One officer, clever
at skinning, sent the skin home, and stated that its value was ten
pounds. It has not been my luck to see any horned owls. Last
July a mounted brigade headquarters had a tame golden eagle which
used to be on view outside the tents. Another buzzard-looking bird
which I see is of a general bluish colour.
Vultures appear from time to time; the best view I had
of them was a year ago, near Lembet. There happened to be a
bamboo-grass enclosure of some nomadic Roumanian shepherds for
the lambing season. It was in a heavy thunderstorm that six of
these great birds flew down one after the other, then sat together
with their great clumsy wings drooping beside them, and around
were a chattering group of magpies, hoodies, and jackdaws--pigmies
among giants. Some offal thrown out was the cause of the gather-
ing. In the dim light they were little scared by my observations. One
vulture was very light yellow, whereas the rest were dark brown.
After four had gone, the light yellow one rested with one of the
brown. I cannot help thinking it might have been an albino
specimen.!
I have ridden close to a bird of much less size by approach-
ing as usual in circles. It eats carrion, has a general vulture
appearance, but not the naked head and neck. Its head is yellowish,

and the yellow colour gradually darkens to the tail and wings, which
are dark.*
Two lovely birds, which we shall always remember after the
war is over, are the " sun-bird," or hee-eater, and the roller (or blue
jay). They are often seen together, and there are men who con-
fuse them. There is much blue about them both ; hut whereas the
roller has a uniform sky-blue hue, the colour of the bee-eater is much
more mysterious and suggestive. The blue of the body is deeper
and more iridescent. Its upper parts are varying shades of yellow,
the head being a fine copper colour, with light yellow in front, edged
behind with white. The cry is heard much, and resembles a short;
high-pitched " purr purr." The flight is graceful and swallow-like,
tail has a long, central projection, producing a spike instead
of two long laterals, forming the forked tail of the swallow.!
It must prey upon very large flying insects, because these
can be so distinctly seen, even at a distance. I hope to find a nest
in the hole of a bank, and describe it and the eggs. The roller has
a nut-brown back. It is very active, consorting much with jackdaws,
upon which it makes prodigious dives in the air when it is disturbed.
Perhaps these dives with the rolling motion and semi-closed wings
give the name of " roller " to the bird.
Mere enumeration of the birds of Macedonia would be tedious,
else I might also describe various waders-- the Little Bustard, a
small Cormorant on the ponds, the Black-headed Tern, Black-headed
Yellow Wagtail, Great-Crested Grebe, Gold-Crest, the Shrikes, Great
Grey and Red-backed Quail, and Pelicans, a flock of which passed
over us yesterday. J

Bv Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.A.
As cage-birds the Cuckoo family does not excel, " of that
there is no shadow of doubt, no shadow of doubt whatever." This
is, I suppose, the reason why they find no place in Dr. Butler's
invaluable two volumes, ' Foreign Birds for Cage and Aviary.'
Nevertheless, as a few are possible cage-birds and have been kept as
such, an account of the species which come under this head, with a
collation of what records there are of these birds in confinement, is
of some interest. May I also hope that it will perhaps be of assist-
ance to the learned doctor, if he is thinking of giving us a new
edition of his book, to deal with the many additions to aviculture of
the last ten years, an event which would receive, I feel sure, the
warmest welcome.
Except for one of the Coucals, which I kept for a short time
in West Africa, I have had no personal experience of the members of
this family as cage-birds, and what follows is the result of gleaning
in the literature at my command. These records, however, I hardly
think will lead me or anyone else to become a Cuckoo-enthusiast, for
they contain little to recommend apart from the difficulty of
obtaining as well as keeping most of these birds and their rarity as
cage-birds, circumstances which, however, will always attract or be
a stimulus to endeavour to some minds. Anyhow, records are
records, and as such are always worth preserving, so I give them for
what they are worth.

This, the best known member of the family, is also the only
one which has been at all commonly kept in captivity, and it would
appear, under these conditions, to have the worst character of all.
Yet in spite of this, in Greene's ' Notes on Cage-bircls,' a correspon-
dent is mentioned as having kept one two seasons. This correspon-
dent kept his Cuckoos in a large garden aviary, but even then and
even from his own account, one can only wonder at his forbearance.

" The Cuckoo has hardly any recommendation as a house-
" bird. When old it is too stubborn and greedy ; and in general
" is either obstinately fierce, or sits in sullen melancholy. I have
" reared some : the last I found in the nest of a Yellow-hammer,
" who was very puzzled with it. It was yet blind, and never-
" theless flew at me with great fury, when I took it out.
" I had hardly had it six days, before it ate in a passion every-

" tame ; it always darted at my face and hands, as well as at
" everything that came too near it, and at other birds. It ate of
" the first universal paste largely, and discharged as copiously-
" and dirtied itself very much ; it also ate its own excrement.
" It is exceedingly clumsy with its short climbing feet ; it cannot
" walk at all, and at best can only be said to jump. It flies,
" however, very cleverly."

Since Bechstein's time there have been numerous records of
Cuckoos in confinement. Of these I select Dr, Bradburn's,* at
whose hands the wretched bird fares but little better than it did in
the previous quotation. He writes :
" I have hand-reared this migratory bird, and for its size
" I can unhesitatingly pronounce it the most filthy and disgust-
" ing that was ever placed in a cage. It is in nowise to be
" recommended as a cage-bird to fanciers, for if you possessed
" one full-grown, it would not feed, and if you rear it by hand
" you will spend a deal of trouble for no adequate return, as they
" seldom live long in confinement. These birds require to be
" fed very much longer than nestlings of other species, and they

Our Cuckoo, then, is no cage-bird, and even in freedom its
well-known parasitic habits bring it no good-will, but on the other
hand it is really not quite as black as it has been painted by some,
especially by the poets, if one may judge from the following, which
I find in Phil. Robinson's ' The Poets' Birds ':
" The idle Cuckoo, having made a feast*
" On sparrow's eggs, layes down her own i' th' nest.
" The silly bird, she owns it, hatches, feeds it,
" Protects it from the weather, clocks and breeds it;
" But w T hen this gaping monster hath found strength
" To shift without a helper, she at length,
"Not caring for the tender care that bred her,
" Forgets her parent, kills the bird that fed her."

We will now turn to the foreign Cuckoos, but before taking
those about which I have found definite records, I will note one
other, of which I find a couple of casual mentions, which should
bring it within the scope of this article. This is the Great Spotted
Cuckoo ( Coccystes glandarius). This bird (or rather the genus

robins, etc.-- Ed.]

This, one of the lovely " Golden Cuckoos " of West Africa, is a
bird about 8 in. long, the male of which is most beautifully clothed
in metallic emerald-green and gold. The&apos;one record of this bird in
confinement I know is that of Keuleman's, who thus closes an

This long life was doubtless due to the fact that, the experi-
ment took place in West Africa, so that the " large quantities of
insect food" required were always obtainable. This -- the ease with
which the food-needs of " soft-bills " can be supplied--is one of the
few advantages of West Africa, but it is an advantage which will
only appeal to the very few. Plenty of bird-food means plenty of
white ants, and therefore, plenty of damage to one's belongings,
while besides there are, of course, the hosts of mosquitoes, flies, and
other creeping and flying tormentors to remember as well.
The Koel ( Eudynamis lionorata).
This is a large black bird, with a rather long tail, which is a
native of India. The male is entirely metallic black, the female
brown spotted with white. These birds, like the Common Cuckoo,
are parasites as regards their eggs, victimising for this purpose the
two Indian Crows. In vol. iii of the 1 Fauna of British Indian Birds,'
by Oates and Blanford, from which the above particulars are derived,
we read (p. 229) that " Koels are often kept caged by natives of

India, who admire the bird's rich melodious notes." Finn, in a
most interesting paper in the ' Ibis ' for 1901 (p. 423) on " The Cage-
birds of Calcutta," says that the male Koel is a very popular pet
with natives and always on sale there, many being reared by hand.
According to Russ the London Zoo received it for the first time in
1864. Other examples, he says, have also been exhibited there and
in other zoological collections and been satisfactorily fed on boiled
rice, fruit, and berries. In India this is no doubt supplemented by
suttoo, the gram and butter paste, which Finn tells us, is the regula-
tion food for all " soft-bills " in India.* In a wild state it feeds
entirely on fruit (Oates and Blanford, l. c.).f
Hawk Cuckoo ( Hierococcyx varius).
This Cuckoo, also a native of India, owes its right to a place
here to Finn's above-mentioned paper, where, after referring to the
Koel, he continues:

In a wild state it is very common throughout India and
Ceylon, where its loud maddening call, " Papiya, papiya," which
during the breeding season is to be heard all day and often for the
greater part of the night also, has earned for the utterer its name of
" Brain-fever Bird." The plumage is grey above and white tinged
with rufous below. In size it is rather larger than the European

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
eggs in the nests of the native Flycatchers (Gerygone). It is a
spotted brown bird, some 16 in. in length. As a cage-bird I have
only one record, that of its inclusion in the London Zoo collection in
1864 (Euss, ' Die Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel,' 1899, p. 662).
The next group are the Coucals, which are found throughout
the greater part of the warmer regions of the Old World. These
birds build their own nests and hatch their own eggs and they are
more or less terrestrial in habit, being strong on the leg but rather
clumsy and slow on the wing. A characteristic feature of the group
is the harsh, stiff plumage. Some half-a-dozen of the forty odd
species appear to have been known as cage-birds. With these 1 will
now deal.
Senegal Coucal (Centropus senecjalensis).
This inhabitant of Tropical Africa I know well in the Gambia,
where I kept one for a short time once and could often have had
others, had I so desired. I do not, however, propose to try for any
more unless at the end of a tour it happens that I can get one or two
just before I am due for leave, so that I can get them home to the
Zoo quickly and without having to waste cage-room on them for
any length of time.
My bird was caught in the kitchen-hut, which he had entered
to pick up scraps, so I presume from this and from the ease with
which he was " meated off," that in a natural state the Coucals are
accustomed to supplement their ordinary diet of insects, reptiles, etc.,
with any offal or dead things they can pick up. It was only a very
short time after capture before he settled down to cage-life, and he
did well until his unregretted escape a month or six weeks later.
At first I fed him on live locusts and any other large insects which
could be easily obtained; then I got him on to dead food, such as
mice and bats, and before very long he would eat almost anything in
the shape of animal matter, such as raw or cooked meat, chicken
guts, and other kitchen refuse. He got tame in a wonderfully short
time, but nevertheless I can hardly give him a good character as a
cage-bird, as his diet would make him a smelly and unpleasant in-
door pet, and his rough loose plumage is so easily soiled, that he soon
loses the few good looks he may originally have possessed.

These birds are very common in the Gambia, where they are
locally known as " Fool-birds," from the idiotic way they have of
offering themselves as targets at the closest range to anyone out with
a gun. In every way they are in a natural state remarkably tame
birds with but little fear of man, of whose presence they scarcely
take any notice as they hop heavily about the bushes and long grass
in search of food. In colour they are chestnut above, with black
head and tail and dirty white under parts. The bill and feet are
black, the latter furnished with powerful claws, that on the hind-
toe being specially long and straight, a feature to which the Coucals
owe their occasional names, " Lark-heels " or " Spur-heeled
Cuckoos." In length our bird measures about 16 in., of which the
tail forms nearly half. Their irides are bright red and give them an
alert and rather fierce expression. Their usual note is one of the
commonest sounds of the evening and (at the commencement of the
breeding season) of the early part of the night as well. It can be
heard on all sides from sundown onwards as one bird answers
another, " Wu-tu-tu-tu " repeated ad lib., with a gradually falling
pitch, the performer attitudinising the while on his perch, his throat
puffed out and collapsed alternately, his head bowed forwards till the
beak points to the toes, the tail held stiffly parallel with the legs, and
the whole attitude apparently one of rigid and grotesque discomfort.
At other times they utter a sort of cackle not unlike a " Bush-fowl's "
call.
The nest is placed low down in a bush always just inside a
patch of really thick growth. The natives believe that one always
finds in the nest a living but crippled snake kept there to scare away
intruders. The origin of this tall story is no doubt the fact that
these birds may frequently be seen carrying off small snakes still
alive and wriggling, and that they may often ornament their nests
with pieces of cast snake-sloughs. From such a basis a Mandingo
would have no difficulty in evolving an even more marvellous tale.
According to Russ the Senegal Coucal has been on exhibition
in the London (first arrival, 1869) and Amsterdam Zoological
Gardens. I also remember that some few years back one of the
London dealers had a couple of African Coucals, but can find no
record of what happened to them. I am not sure, too, to what

species they belonged, but rather think they came from South Africa
and were therefore probably burchelli.*
Indian Coucal or " Crow-Pheasant " ( C . sinensis).
The range of this bird extends from India to China, Malaya,
the Malay Islands, and the Philippines. Its plumage is black
glossed with green and set off by a chestnut wing-patch ; in length
it measures 19 in. Finn ( l. c .) says that it is often brought into
the Calcutta bird-market, but not as a pet, but on account of some
fancied medicinal value. In Oates and Blanford will be found a full
description of the plumage, etc., and a paragraph on its habits in a
natural state. As a cage-bird it is included among the Coucals
mentioned by Russ (t. c. supra under " Society Cuckoo "), who tells
us that it first appeared in the Zoo list in 1867. To this writer I
also owe the cage records for the remainder of the Coucals wdiich I
mention.
Lesser Coucal (C. bengalensis).
This species, also a native of India, is a small edition of the
preceding. It has been on exhibition in the Amsterdam Zoo.
Australian Coucal (G. phasiamcs).
A black bird with chestnut wing-patches and dull green under
parts. Its exhibition in the London (1872) and the Berlin Zoos
(1897) is on record.
New Guinea Coucal ( C . menebeki.).
This is another black bird not unlike the Australian, which
inhabits New Guinea and some of the neighbouring islands. Buss
records one instance of its living arrival in Europe, the importation
of some by Fockelmann, of Hamburg, in 1894, who, in reference to
this event writes as follows to Buss :
" In May, 1894, I had five ' Mohrenkukuke,' since then
" I have seen no others. One of them, the Zoological Garden
" at Hamburg had, two went to a private customer in Italy
* [Since tlie above was written when looking through some back numbers of the
Magazine, I have come across (1909, p. 119) an account by Mr. G. H. Gurney
of the keeping in captivity of another species of Coucal, the White-browed
(C. superciliosus) from East Africa. This is described by the writer as
having been a charmingly tame and interesting pet.

" and one to Copenhagen ; of the fifth I can find no particulars,

Russ also mentions another Coucal, which he calls the Sunda
Islands Coucal as having been kept by the Amsterdam Zoo. This
is probably C. javanicus, which has an extensive range from Assam
and Malaya to the Malay Islands, the Philippines, and Celebes.
Radiated Fruit-Cuckoo ( Carpococcyx radiatus).
This bird is a native of Borneo and the last of the Old World
Cuckoos with which I have to deal. Above it is a dark metallic
green glossed on the wings and tail with bluish; below brown with
dark green cross-stripes. The bill is green and a red bare eye-patch
is a noticeable feature. One of these rare birds lived for a long time
in the Zoo, a record of which is to be found in the following foot-note
to a paper on the anatomy of the bird, which appeared in the ' Ibis '
for 1901, p. 200 :
"Received August 31st, 1882. See ' P.Z.S.,' 1882,
" p. 358. It lived nearly eighteen years in the Gardens, and
"died June 7th, 1900. It was fed mostly on a vegetable diet
" with a little scraped meat intermixed; occasionally insects
" were given, and a dead mouse every other day."
Russ mentions the same individual in his list, and here we
have one of the few records of a long and doubtless honourable
life of a captive Cuckoo. * I wish I could find and give the same
amount of information about the Coucals mentioned above, where
the particulars are so meagre that they probably indicate but short
and unsatisfactory sojournings in their European homes.
Guira Cuckoo ( Guira guira).
These South American Cuckoos have been not infrequently
kept at the Zoo and in other collections of birds In the Zoo they
have nested but never succeeded in rearing their young. This
* [This individual was figured in the Illustrated London News as " A New Arrival
at the Zoo : the Radiated Fruit Cuckoo." I well remember seeing it in

one leg at some time or other. -- G. R.]

Mr. E. E. Blaauw,
happy result, however, has been attained elsewhere, by Lord
Poltimore, a record of whose success (in a large aviary) in 1911
appeared in 'Bird Notes' for that year, p. 273. The Guira may,
I think, from this be given the first place, with the Radiated Fruit-
Cuckoo a good second, among the very scratch lot of " Cuckoos as
Cage-birds." It at least is the only one to have reached the zenith
of having reproduced its species in confinement. All the rest I am
afraid we must class very near the Nadir of the avicultural sphere.*
In a wild state they nest like the Ani and the African Buffalo
Weavers in communities, many pairs sharing in the building and
occupation of a huge tenement dwelling. Their general colour is
light brown streaked especially on the head and neck with black;
in size they are slightly larger than the European Cuckoo.
Ani ( Crotophaga ani).
This is another South American bird, whose range extends
to the West Indies, where it is popularly known as " Blackbird,"
" Black Witch," or " Cattle-bird," names derived from its colour
(uniform black glossed with purple) or its habits. A whole flock
will share a large common nest, in which the accommodation is
often so strained that numbers of the eggs laid by the tenants are
crowded out and fall to the ground. See ' Ibis,' 1910, p. 274, where
the eggs are described as pale blue covered with a white chalky
substance, and also 'Avicultural Magazine,' 1903, p. 22.
As a cage-bird, this species appears in the Zoo List, its first
appearance being in 1875 according to Russ, who also records it in
the Berlin Zoo in 1892.

On my way home from South America in 1911 I spent a day
in the beautifully-situated capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro.
* [A Guira Cuckoo, which I purchased on November 14th, 1903, when let out into
my aviary, ran rather than climbed about the branches : it uttered a mew-
like whistle, and shivered its wings in true picarian fashion. When sur-
prised or interested it crouched down and extended its neck. The iris was
orange red.--G. B.]

on the breeding of the Tropical Seed-Finch. 41
I had made a tour in an auto amongst the slopes of the
Tujuca, where the beautiful blue Morpho butterflies were playing
amongst the flowering trees.
I had visited the wonderful botanical gardens, where small
Finches and Sugar-birds were flying amongst the wonders of tropical
vegetation, and having about an hour or so before I had to go back
to the ship, I paid a visit to the " Mercado Central," where, amongst
vegetables, meat, and every other conceivable thing, I found two
small bird shops.
It is not very easy for a foreigner to buy birds in a " Mercado
Central " of a South American town.
Of course they see at once, and if they don't see it they hear
it, that one is a stranger, and they accordingly think it their duty to
themselves to ask tremendous prices for the most common things--
prices which rival or surpass very often what would be asked in a
bird shop in Europe for those same birds.
Their value is a milreis, and these " thousands " of reis multi-
plied by fancy figures give tremendous numbers of reis ! If, to put
their demands into proper limits, one bids what they think too low a
price, they get offended and are as likely as not to refuse to sell
altogether!
In this way I lost three of the rare Violet-bellied Parrots
(Triclaria cyanogaster), an example of which was owned by Mr.
Astley (our Editor) some years ago, and which I admired very much.
Two of the three birds seemed all right, but number three had a
deformed leg. I asked the price. Many thousands of reis were
wanted. I made a bid and the owner, after having given me a
murderous look, turned round and . . . began to close his shop.
Nothing could be done !
The pair of Oryzoborus torridus fortunately had another
owner, and in addition to other small birds I managed to get them.
The man thought me rather a fool to buy the female, which he told
me could not sing and would be of no use to me.
However, she wandered to the ship with her hushand and the
other acquisitions. The lovely little male, with his shining black
dress and beautiful deep chestnut breast and belly, looked a little
delicate and continued to do so all through the voyage, so that I

42 On the breeding of the Tropical Seed-Finch.
thought that he would not survive. I was mistaken, however, for he
recovered and has now lived here all these five years.
The male has a very nice song, and when he is courting the
female he displays in various ways with wings and tail. He will also
jump into the air whilst he is singing.
The female is of a pale milk-chocolate colour all over. Both
have very short and powerful bills.
Since their safe arrival at Gooilust I have kept the birds
during the summer in a small aviary in the garden, with other
small birds, and in winter in the bird-house.
This season, having an unoccupied compartment in a garden
aviary, I thought I would give them a chance to breed, and put the
pair of birds into it with no other ones to disturb them.
They seemed to like this privacy very much, becoming very
lively, and the male sang from morning till night. The first attempt
at breeding was a clear egg laid on the bare board in a nesting-box
with no attempt at a nest.
After this, thinking that there was something wrong with the
nesting-site and material, I put up a kind of witch-broom made out
of a birch, in which I had formed a cup-shaped hollow, against one
of the sides of the aviary.
As nesting material I gave a lot of rootlets and fine branches,
adding some feathers.
It seems that this new arrangement suited the birds, for they
at once took possession of the witch-broom, and the female built a
shallow nest in it with the rootlets and fine branches, finishing off
with a few feathers.
As I found out later three eggs were laid, which were spotted
with brown and purple, and were not unlike Sparrows' eggs.
How long the female incubated I cannot say, but after about
three weeks the voice of a baby was heard occasionally, and the
female caught all the small insects she could get.
I had given her fresh ants' eggs as well, and with one and the
other, and probably later or also with the help of seed, the youngster
grew very well, and after not many days left the nest looking like a
stumpy miniature of an owl, as it could not boast of much of a tail.
Although it could fly it spent its first days of comparative inde-

pendence on the ground in a warm corner of the aviary, the parents
feeding it with great care.
The two other eggs were clear, and were evacuated from the nest.
As soon as anyone came near the aviary the male would begin
to sing and come very near one, looking very inquisitive. This he
also did when the female was incubating.
I fancy that in this way he would try to draw away the atten-
tion of the visitors from the female or young one, in the same way as a
Crane will feign to be lame if one comes upon his young ones suddenly.
The young Tropical Seed-Finch in its first feathers closely
resembles the female, but is much paler in colour, and the white
wing-mark is not clearly defined. The bill and legs are blackish
flesh-colour, corners of bill yellowish.
Has anyone bred this species in confinement before ?

By C. H. A. Lieman.
Although not a member of the Avicultural Society, I have
been a subscriber to the ' Avicultural Magazine ' for some time. My
only reason for not being proposed as a candidate for election is that
I am not personally acquainted with any of the members, so that I
could not ask them to recommend me. On reading through the list
of members which was published in the November number of your
Magazine, I note that so far there are none in this State. But
being very interested in birds, and having kept most of the smaller
seed-eaters at one time or another, I am taking the liberty of sending
a few notes on the subject from South Australia, and sincerely trust
that I am not out of order in doing so.
We have several very keen fanciers in Adelaide, a number of
whom have been successful in getting young ones from some of the
rarer specimens.
Mr. R. E. P. Osborne was until recently the possessor of
the largest collection of birds here. He had a splendid lot of aviaries,
covering nearly an acre of ground altogether, in which he kept
Pheasants of all kinds, Doves, Parrots, Quail, native Pigeons, and

Mr. C. H. A. Lieman,
most of the smaller aviary birds. He has recently sold his town
house and gone to live on his farm in the country. Although his
birds have found good homes in the other fanciers' aviaries here, it
was a great pity that such a splendid collection of birds had to
be dispersed, as it had taken years to get together.
In addition to most of the aviary birds usually bred, he was
successful in rearing a great number of Orange, Napoleon, and Mada-
gascar Weavers, Pekin Nightingales, Paradise Whydahs, and Cardinals.
Last season he was successful in rearing two young hybrids
between a cock crimson finch and a hen star-finch, but unfortunately
they were killed by some other finches in the aviary soon after
leaving the nest, so that it would be impossible to form much idea
of what their adult plumage would have been like.
Has this hybrid been bred before ? *
Mr. F. P. Kell is another ardent fancier who secured a great
number of Mr. Osborne's birds. He has a fine and comprehensive
collection of all classes and has ample accommodation for them.
Mr. D. R. Gee specialises in Parrots, of which he has a varied
collection from all parts of the world, and in addition has an aviary
devoted to the smaller seed-eaters.
Mr. von Rieben's special fancy is Waterfowl and Pheasants,
and they show to great advantage in the grounds of his beautiful
home at Rose Park. Native Pigeons, Parrots, and Finches also each
have an aviary devoted to them.
Mr. H. G. Young, of Somerton, has done wonderfully
well with Yellow Budgerigars. Two years ago he started with
one pair. He now has over seventy, all descended from the original
pair of birds.
Mr. Guy Whitington is another keen fancier, and he has been
successful in breeding the Bicheno-Zebra finch hybrids, some of
which were beautifully marked.
My own aviary is about 45 ft. long by 12 ft. wide. It has
wire netting on the top and both sides, with the exception of 12 ft.
at one end, which is roofed over with galvanised iron and covered in
on the south and east sides with weather-board.
* This hybrid was bred in Mr. Astley's aviary in Italy (Varenna) in 1908

With the exception of Pekin Nightingales and Silver-eyes
I devote my attention entirely to the smaller seed-eaters.
There is a fairly large lemon tree growing in the centre of
the open part of the aviary, and several smaller bushes of Acacia
armata round it and in the corners. Being evergreen and rather
prickly, the birds seem to prefer the acacia to all other bushes to
build their nests in when flying wild. That is the reason why we
plant them in preference to others.
I also keep lucerne growing on about half of the open space.
This grows to a height of about 14- to 2 ft. Every morning in the
summer I set a fine sprinkler going over it, and this helps to keep
the ground cool and moist.
The birds love this, and during the heat of the day, when
the thermometer soars up to 110* F. in the shade, they are nearly
always to be found in or under it, and I am certain that the moist
shade which it affords is very beneficial to them.
Around the edge of the open portion are planted various native
tufty grasses, the seeds of which are greatly relished by the birds.
In the enclosed portion I have placed a few hollow logs, but
the majority of the nests are made of cigar boxes and in these
most of the birds prefer to make their nests. I cut a small
opening towards one end of the front, thus
and place
them with the lid on top, so that they can he easily opened
and the contents examined. Those that prefer to build their nests
in the bushes are the Pekin Nightingales, Orange and Madagascar
Weavers, Gouldian, Bicheno, Cherry and Firetail Finches. I find
the latter quite hardy and, with the exception of the Zebra Finches,
they breed more freely than most of the others.
The Pectoral Finches almost invariably build their nests in
the tufts of grass and quite close to the ground.
During last season an African Silver-bill cock mated up with
a Bibfinch hen and successfully reared three young ones, which were
midway between the parents in size and colour, but instead of bibs
had barred marking on the throat similar to a male Zebra Finch.
I also reared a hybrid between a Parson Finch and a Long-tailed
Grassfinch. This turned out a hen, which mated up to a Grassfinch

and has reared young ones. These exactly resembled the long-tailed
grassfinches in every particular.
In conclusion I should like to relate the doings of a cock Red-
headed Finch. He has been a widower now for over twelve months.
A few weeks ago three young white Java Sparrows came out
of the nest rather soon and he immediately took charge of them.
He used to follow them wherever they went and fed them most
regularly. He would do his best to keep them together and would
preen their feathers for them and look after them in every possible
way. Moreover, he would not allow their own parents to come
near them and, although the young Javas can now look after
themselves quite well, he still follows them about and at night
huddles up close to them on the perch.
As I write, we are in the middle of winter and the foreigners
are all in their winter plumage, but our Australian birds are as brilliant
as ever, and I certainly think it a great advantage for birds to look
their best all the year round.
Needless to say the birds are never provided with any artificial
heat, but live the hardy outdoor life and so manage to come through
even the severest winters.
CORRESPONDENCE.
THE TAHA WEAVER.
Dear Sir, -- What is a Taha Weaver? I bought a pair recently, and I
thought they were merely Napoleon Bishops subject to melanism, but the dealer
said not. I hoped they might lose the melanism, but it seems to increase and the
hen is almost black. The cock is nearly in full colour, but has far less yellow than
an ordinary Napoleon.
If not Napoleons, are they equally hardy, and what country do they come
from ?
Yours faithfully,
The Citadel, Alfred Thom.
Hawkstone, Salop. _
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Thom :
Pyromelana taha is a southern representative of the Napoleon Weaver (P.
afra ); the latter ranges from Senegambia to the Niger and possibly to Benguela.
P. talia ranges from Benguela eastwards to Nyasaland, south-eastward to Lake
Ngamiand Natal; it is common in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, where
(according to Stark) immense flocks assemble in the autumn and remain together
until the following spring.
I believe P. taha to be quite hardy, but cannot speak from personal experi-
ence, as I have not kept the species.
A. G. Butler.

A pet Vulture is, I think, somewhat off the beaten track of
aviculture.
The normal appearance of the animal is not attractive ; his
habits are distinctly repellent, and against these he cannot lay claim
to any counter-attractions, such as a melodious voice or an unduly
intelligent personality.
The bird, whose photograph is reproduced, had, for me at all
events, the fascination of novelty at the outset ; and as time went
on, his quiet unobtrusiveness developed in me an affection which I
did not think I should have ever possessed for him.
He came from West Africa with my brother some years ago,
and was a little under a year in my possession.
I am sorry I cannot give any information as to his early
history beyond the fact that he was taken from a nest when quite
young by a native, and brought in to my brother, who had a great
liking for unusual pets of all kinds.
He established, in due time, an ascendancy over any other
animals of his own size with which he was brought into contact, and
developed a great affection for a native dog, whose life he made a
burden, as he habitually took up a position on his back, in the
broiling sun.
When coming home to Ireland my brother decided to bring

this bird, and he formed one of quite a consignment of wild beasts,
which, so far as I can recollect, included the following : Six Crowned
Cranes, one Hornbill, two Grey Parrots, one Duiker Antelope, and
one Patas Monkey.
In this connection I might mention in passing that two of
these Crowned Cranes were given to Mr. Baring, of Lambay Island,
off the Co. Dublin coast, where they had complete liberty, and
Mr. Baring has told me that the spectacle of these large birds flying
about the Island was a wonderfully interesting and attractive one.
Subsequently one died and the other flew to the mainland to be
promptly shot, of course, as a rare visitor.
The vulture arrived in quite a small box, looking thoroughly
bedraggled.
Notwithstanding his condition, however, my brother insisted
on admitting my very game Irish Terrier at his liberation, assuring
me that the bird would more than hold his own in any encounter.
The result was a great surprise to me, as, on the dog pro-
ceeding to tackle him, this dissipated-looking scarecrow met the
attack with wings and neck fully extended--a fearsome sight, before
which my friend Jack retreated gradually backwards the whole
length of the garden, eventually finding sanctuary in his kennel with
the vulture standing before the entrance.
As no properly-constructed dog could ever forget, much less
forgive, such ignominious treatment, Jack always cherished a bitter
hatred for this aggressive interloper and was continually on the
look out for chances to get even. As the vulture was quite indifferent
whether he presented his face or his tail to the dog, the latter had
many opportunities of making attacks in the rear, which he took
every advantage of, and I had to go to the rescue of the bird on
many occasions.
He always roosted at night in a large box under a roof which
sheltered my greenhouse stove. To reach these quarters he was
obliged to " step over " Jack's kennel, and lie generally wasted no
time over this operation.
He was perfectly free to come and go as he liked, being more
or less pinioned, and every morning he might be seen as the sun got
up, solemnly stalking up the garden to his perch in the centre of

the grass plot, where he spent most of the day, only leaving it to
visit the back door for his grub -- which consisted of clean, cooked
meat -- and to return just before dusk to his roosting quarters.
In course of time he developed a very fine coat of feathers
and one windy day he sailed up in the air against the breeze and
made a tour of the neighbourhood, eventually landing in an adjoining
lane, where I easily secured him and provided against a repetition of
this little entertainment.
He was so exceedingly independent and so well qualified to
look after himself that I never worried much about him, merely
glancing at his perch occasionally to see if he was there.
One morning, however, he did not appear, and on going to his
roosting-box I was greatly distressed to find he had died in the
night, probably owing to the stove, from which he got a certain
amount of warmth, having gone out.
Poor old bird; my garden looked quite hare without his
familiar figure sitting on the perch --always an interesting object.
I don't know what species he belonged to, but his appearance
was more attractive than that of those one is accustomed to view
in Zoological Gardens, as, presumably, owing to the fact that he was
fed on clean meat and had no opportunities of burrowing into foul
matter, his neck was well-clothed.
[This bird was the Western Hooded Vulture ( Neophron
monachus)-- practically a smaller, long-beaked race of the better
known Southern Hooded Vulture ( Neophron pileatus). Mr. Low is
to be congratulated on having possessed a very rare and interesting
pet, and his photographs are probably unique. No others which
certainly represent this species appear to exist.-- G. R.]

The White Scavenger Vulture ( Neophron ginginianus) claims
first consideration. It is a common species, and was seen wherever
I went, except near the coast. From my window in the Cecil Hotel,
Agra, one of them was seen sitting in a bulky nest in a neem tree

not more than 25 feet away. A position on the roof, overlooking
the nest, was sought at once, but the nest was empty when the bird
left. Such a location was highly advantageous for study when the
nest life was in progress.
The White Scavenger Vulture at times has a woe-begone,
dishevelled appearance, as if it appreciated the contumely heaped
upon it by mankind. In view of its single shortcoming, it is a pity
that the bird cannot talk back. If it could, its reply would probably
be something like this : " Oh, vainglorious man ! wherefore do you
cast such volumes of reproach upon me ? Am I not a faithful
spouse and a devoted parent? Do you ever see me figuring in the
divorce courts because of inconstancy, or my offspring deserted by
me, left to the tender mercies of strangers in my tribe ? Do you see
me robbing my brothers or slaying millions of them in unholy war ?
Your sole accusation against me is that I am a scavenger and not
too proud to eat human ordure ; but what living creature do I harm
by my tastes ? Certainly I take nothing that turns me into a
frenzied fiend so that I beat my mate, kill my offspring, and en-
danger the lives or happiness of my neighbours, nor do I smoke a
filthy weed that poisons the air for every one near me. Oh, you
contemptible man ! I have seen you fill with smoke the air of a
small enclosure, where were others of your kind, men and women,
unable to escape, who were sickened and gasping in utter misery.
So I say unto you, critical man, that unless you can show more
decent taste, you have no right to criticise mine."
Besides the White Scavenger, at least three other species of
vultures were seen: the Black or King Vulture (Otogyps calvus),
the White-backed Vulture (Pseudogyps bengalensis), and the Long-
billed Vulture (Gyps tenuirostris). In most instances they were
distant about an eighth of a mile, but sometimes no more than half
of that distance. As a rule they were in desolate places--along a
river bank or about some ruin. Across the river from the Massacre
Ghat at Cawnpore were several of these birds. While using my
binoculars I saw one waiting for a dog to finish its repast. The
object being devoured looked very human, and my guide affirmed
that it was the body of a man that had drifted ashore some days
before. Two human skulls lay directly in front of the Taj Mahal on

the banks of the Jumna River, and were detected when the glasses
were turned upon some plovers feeding there. Such ghastly finds
are not so surprising in a country teeming with millions of Hindus,
whose religion forbids the burying of the dead, and where the cost
of the wood for the funeral pyre is almost prohibitory for some
families.
On the morning of my visit to the bathing ghats of Benares
I witnessed two Hindu funerals ; the first was that of a woman, and
her nearest relative, after walking five times around the pyre, applied
the torch ; the other was that of an infant, whose body was weighted
with stones preparatory to its being cast into the Ganges, for this is
the disposal made of the bodies of Hindu children who die before
they have attained the age of three years. In this river were
hundreds of pious Hindus taking their sacred baths, energetically
scouring their teeth, or drinking the water dipped up by the hand.
The immense number of tombs to be seen outside of some
of the cities tends to create the feeling that India is one vast grave-
yard, but these are Mohammedan tombs, showing the fruits of
death's harvest for a few hundred years only. Another religious
sect, the Parsee, holds that the elements are too sacred to be polluted
by the dead, hence their bodies cannot be burned nor cast into the
water as are the Hindu's, neither must they desecrate the earth by
burial therein. To obviate these things Towers of Silence are
provided on which the bodies of dead Parsees are exposed to the
vultures -- the White-backed and the Long-billed are the species in
Bombay that are said to frequent these towers, there being about
three hundred birds that divide their time between the towers and
the slaughter-houses.
In Bombay the stated hours for funerals are nine o'clock
in the morning and five in the afternoon. The vultures begin to
assemble regularly an hour or two before funeral time. When I was
there at 3 p.m. from twenty to thirty birds had arrived and were
waiting on the walls. They are said to complete their task within
the space of two hours. There are five of the towers ; some have
private ownership; one is for criminals, suicides, and for the bodies
of the unfortunate Parsees that chance after death to be touched by
someone outside the caste. The principal tower is 25 feet high and

" Unguibus et rostro tarda trahet ilia vultur."-- Ovid.
Vultures may be termed a permanent feature of every African
landscape. Sailing overhead in majestic circles through the azure--
slowly descending in ever-narrowing curves--perched on some craggy
ledge overlooking some awful precipice--in each instance these
strange wild-fowl add a touch of savage romance to the scene. Some
years ago the writer had the opportunity of studying at close
quarters the habits of the Egyptian species (. Neophron percnopterus).
One afternoon remains imprinted on the memory. The scene
was a romantic rocky gorge, along the bottom of which there flowed
a little stream : a cascade rushed into the abyss, dissolving in a
shower of spray. Swarms of Swifts wheeled about the rocks, their
nests dotting the rugged surface in profusion ; and crowds of Pigeons,
Jackdaws, and Lesser Kestrel enlivened the scene with their numbers.
High overhead the Vultures circled, black and white against the blue :
with their ample pinions it was difficult to distinguish them from
their neighbours, the Storks, and this difficulty has been experienced
by others--indeed, as they passed overhead the Vultures recalled the
Manchurian Cranes depicted on Japanese screens. As the writer
watched, a lovely being floated along the gorge--the Scarce Swallow-
tail Butterfly ( Papilio podalirius ) with wings of primrose yellow 7 ,
zebra-striped in black. So near did it come that it seemed that it
could easily have been captured, but it was allowed to depart in
peace.*
On the rough ledge opposite nine Vultures sat in a row 7 , there
were several others below them, though they were difficult to make
* [This butterfly is literally " zebra-striped," for the varying breadth and intensity
of the bands on the wings wonderfully resembles the stripes and " shadow
stripes" of Burchell's Zebra ( Equus burchellii.) --Ed.]

out from the scarred and fissured rock. Once a mother bird in white
adult apparel was seen feeding her dusky, well-grown chick : the food
probably consisted of the abundant locusts which seemed everywhere,
and the remains of which were observed upon or close to the path.
When flying the Vulture's wing, as in so many other birds, curls up
at the tip, as if warped by the wind. The writer saw a Lesser
Kestrel deliberately attempt to perch on the back of a flying Vulture,
this was most interesting, as the fact has been asserted to occur by
other African travellers, and I think it is Chapman who in his book
published a figure of a small bird actually taking a ride in this way.
Any such occurrences that may have been observed by Members of
the Society resident abroad would make excellent reading for this
Magazine.
" A glowing landscape of red hills, seamed with cracks and
ravines," says one's note book. " A green tint on them like a feeble
wash of colour toning down the red. Blue haze on distant hills. A
great sense of clear atmosphere and breadth and elbow room. Land-
scape in a shimmering silky glow of heat."
Such is the home of the African Vulture.

In April, 1911, I obtained four eggs from the Hebrides and
put them under a hen. After twenty-eight days two birds hatched,
the other two eggs were found to be bad. The trouble at first
was that the young birds showed no desire to eat the finely-
chopped egg provided, or, indeed, any of the other delicacies which
were offered. Matters looked serious after twenty-four hours,
but a hurried visit to a farmer's wife produced the solution. Her
reply was: "Don't bother them, and just give them a turf of fine
grass." The advice was followed, and they began to eat at once,
and the coop was moved on to a piece of fine shortish pasture.
After a few days they would eat a little egg and biscuit meal,
but never cared for it; fresh water was given four times a day and
fine gravel, and they thrived fast. After four months a little wheat
was given, and later wheat and barley mixed; but to this day they

prefer wandering about and eating grass for choice, and eat but
little corn.
Lord William Percy hatched out two birds at the same date
from three eggs, and allowed his to have access to water early, so
it does not appear that going in water when young does any harm.
His two are a pair, and the female this year, for the first time, gets
distinctly cross if approached. They may breed this year, which is
their third spring (1914).
At one time, when shooting, I looked on a black-spotted breast
and under breast as a sign of age and respectability, but, as will be
seen from the photograph, a bird barely three years of age may
possess it. Last year the same bird had only three black spots
showing. There is little doubt that if my birds had a lake or good
pond they would certainly breed, but in the indifferent place I have
it is doubtful. If they do, it will be due to their great tameness I
think.
The length of life of the Grey Lag is very great--how great
no one quite knows ; but a farmer in Ross-shire is reputed to have
had one forty-two years, and the late Lord Lilford winged " an old
gander " on the Guadalquiver in 1882, and the bird was alive in 1900,
and may be yet.
Unfortunately, fewer breed in Scotland each year, due to dis-
turbance by tourists and quasi-egg collectors. About three years
ago I knew of close on thirty-one nests in Ross-shire, Sutherland,
and Uist, but last year (1913) there were very few.
Crofters in Uist dislike them -- with some reason from an
agricultural point of view, but to the detriment of the ornithological
one -- and now that a great portion of South Uist is taken by the
Crofter Commission, there will be less.
In 1766 to 1800 they were said to be common in the Fens and
bred there, but probably, in a few years, Anser cinereus will be amongst
the ever-increasing number of birds who rarely breed in Great Britain.
P.S. [April, 1915).--My Grey Lag nested in May, 1914, but
all eggs were clear, as were Lord W. Percy's.
It raises the question as to whether the Grey Lag does breed
in the third year or takes longer to come to maturity on the part of
the male.

GEESE.
By Maurice Portae.
Variation from the normal in Grey Lag Geese or Pink-foot
Geese is uncommon though by no means unknown.
A White Grey Lag Goose visited Uist for some years before
coming to an untimely end by a chance shot.
It is probably a rare occurrence, as it is so seldom seen in
spite of the great numbers which make South Uist a home for the
winter or a resting-place on migration and immigration.
Two years ago a Cream-coloured Goose in immature plumage
was seen on the Solway and eventually killed. It proved to he a
young male in good plumage--the colour of the feathers was a uniform
sandy-cream colour, slightly darker at the extremities. This year a
White Goose has appeared -- pure white, except that the head is
brown-cream colour--whether it is a Grey Lag or a Pink-foot I am
unable to say, as I have not had time to go and see it with a tele-
scope. There is also another uniformly coloured Cream Goose in,
but that may pass on, as it is early yet in the season.
The White Goose is not a Snow Goose, as it has no black
feathers in the wings, and its head is as stated.
It may be possible that it is one of the cream-coloured ones
of more mature age, and that cream colour turns into white with
mature moulting.
If one could catch it alive one might learn much, but the
chance is too remote to hope for or expect.
That variations are rare is proved by the fact that these three
instances are the only ones noted in the past seventeen years out of
the many thousands of geese which pass up and down the Solway
or remain there for a few months.

The summer of 1911 was terrible, being the hottest and most
rainless summer experienced in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk
since 1868 (see Weather Report, by A. W. Preston, F.R.Met.Soc.)
In many places fields of barley took fire by the sparks emitted from
adjacent lines of railway. July 31st was supposed to have been the
hottest July day for fifty-two years, and on August 9th my thermometer
stood at 96* in the shade. Young Partridges did not suffer nearly
so much as many people, who are unaware how little moisture
these birds require, expected, and, contrary to anticipation, it proved
an extraordinarily good year for wild Pheasants.
The great event of 1911 was the breeding of the Bittern,
possibly due to the drying up of some of the Dutch swamps by the
great heat. Miss Turner has already published an admirable
account of the way in which she found the young one (cf. 1 British
Birds ' and ' Country Life ' (December 2nd, 1911)), but I can add a
few particulars to this record. The last nidification of a Bittern in
Norfolk, if not in England, was in 1886, when a young one was
obtained. Although nearly full-grown, there was no doubt about its
being home-bred, for there was still down upon it.
May 8th. -- This was really a summer's day, and perfect or
birds'-nesting. Accordingly, it was with no small pleasure that Mr.
Gerard Gurney and I directed our steps, by invitation, to one of the
smaller Broads, where Redshanks and Reed-Buntings were soon
seen, but on this occasion no Grasshopper-Warblers, although it is a
favourite place for them, and some had been recently heard. Flitting
among the reed-tops were a good many Bearded Tits, which the
absence of wind had tempted up from their recesses. Although
the "Reed Pheasant" no longer suffers from the rapacity of dealers,
the gradual growing up of our Broads must more and more limit its
area of distribution. A Coot's nest was presently found, containing
two eggs and four newly-hatched young ones, whose orange heads
were quite resplendent among the reeds. These active mites speedily

slipped over the sides of the nest, but one bolder than the rest crept
into its fabric, evidently thinking that between the blades of holder-
rush its brilliantly coloured head would be concealed, and it was less
conspicuous than might have been expected. In six weeks these
young Coots would be white-breasted Coots. Further on, Mr. It.
Gurney punted us to a Great Crested Grebe's nest, and again the
scarlet countenance of a very young Grebe was seen eyeing us from
between the blades of the bolder. About 1 p.m. the "boom" of a
Bittern was distinctly audible, and again at 1.20 the strange sound
swept over the water, not loud this time, hut rising in volume like
some distant fog-horn. Naumann expresses it on paper by the
syllables " ii-prumb," repeated slowly, which perhaps is as near to it
as any imitation can he. It seemed very similar to the " booming "
of the Little Bittern which I heard at Saham Mere in 1894.
July 8th . -- Nesting of the Bittern .- -- -After an arduous search in
a dense reed-bed, higher than a man's head, a well-feathered young
Bittern was found by Miss E. L. Turner and J. Vincent, which it was
naturally concluded could not be the only one, as the Bittern lays
four eggs. It refused to take food when placed in its mouth, whence
Miss Turner judged that the young are fed by regurgitation, and the
only sound it uttered was " a curious bubbling note." As the young
of the Bittern are not hatched simultaneously it is possible that this
was the youngest bird of the clutch. The illustration of a young
Bittern taken at Ranworth long ago (Gurney and Fisher, ' Zool.,' 1846,
p. 1321) will hardly hear comparison with Miss Turner's beautiful
photographs. The discovery of the nest fell to the Rev. M. C. Bird
eleven days later. From Mr. Robert Gurney, who was w T ith him, j
learn that w T hen found it was full of Bittern's feathers, with a few
fish-scales, probably those of rudd and roach. This nest, which I
had an opportunity of examining afterwards, viz. on August 1st,
was, according to my tape measurements, 18 x 15 in. at the water's
edge, with a depth in the centre of about 4 - 7 in.; roughly speaking,
it was an ovate circle. It rested on no solid foundation, there being
about 18 in. of water below it, in which I felt about in the hope of
finding a rotten egg. The fabric is well shown in a photograph by
Miss Turner, who thought that its flatness was probably owing to
its having been trampled down by the nestlings. But even in this

condition it hardly deserved the epithet of a careless structure, which
has been applied to it by some writers. The nest was situated
among the stems of the reeds, and could only be approached by
wading. It was principally composed of broken stalks of the bulrush,
here called " bolder-reed " (Scirpus lacustris), by vast tracts of which
it was surrounded.
The young Bitterns kept about, and on the 27th two were
seen by Mr. Robert Gurney, but not together. This was within half
a mile of the nest, and the old bird could be plainly heard croaking
to them. That they eventually got off unmolested there is every
reason to believe, and I think a general desire was shown to protect
them.*

By the Marquis of Tavistock.
The " present disturbed state of Europe," as railway notices
used to put it, still decrees that the majority of my birds shall spend
their time in temporary quarters, to which I can only pay an
occasional flying visit at long intervals. In addition to being rather
small, these quarters have the disadvantage of lying within what I
may term the " septicaemia zone." My first experiments in avi-
culture were carried on in the Midlands, where cases of septicaemia
were almost unknown, and I used to read with some scorn the
statements by old writers to the effect that it was useless to try and
keep many-coloured or Paradise Parrakeets as they always die of
" cerebral haemorrhage." But when, at the beginning of the war, I
was compelled to move my collection to the Isle of Wight, I found
out that there was something in what the old aviculturists had
written after all. At irregular intervals, and without warning, one
after another of my Yellow-bellies, Many-colours, and Red-vented
Bluebonnets was seized with a brief, violent, and fatal illness, and
not only they but other rarities besides, including two Red-shining
Parrakeets and an Albino Grey Parrot. For a long time the post-

mortem reply came back, " cerebral haemorrhage," until examination
by an expert more accustomed to bird ailments pronounced it septi-
caemia, an internal inflammation being the real cause of death and
the brain symptoms of secondary importance. Everything was tried
as a preventative--medicine, diet, boiled water -- without avail, and the
remnant were only saved by sending them to a friend in Gloucester-
shire.
But fortunately only certain species seem susceptible to the
disease, and the breeding season of 1917, though not without its
disappointments, has proved not unsatisfactory as a whole. The
birds from which there was at least a hope of obtaining young
were 3 pairs of Stanleys, 4 pairs of Barrabands, 1 pair of Queen
Alexandras, 1 pair of Pileated, 1 pair of Bauers, 1 Yellow-mantle
paired to a Rosella, 1 pair of Redrumps, 1 pair of Bourkes, 3 pairs of
Blue-winged Grass Parrakeets, 1 cock Rock Grass Parrakeet paired
to a Bluewing hen (who is minus one foot, but a good layer), 2 pairs
of Guiana Parrotlets, 1 Lutino Indian Ringneck paired to a green
cock, 1 Lutino African Ringneck similarly mated, 1 Lutino Blossom-
head similarly mated, 3 pairs of Hooded and a Blue-faced Lorikeet
( T. hcematodus ) paired to a cock Swainson.
Of these birds the Stanleys, the Barrabands, the Queen
Alexandras, the Pileated, the Redrumps, and the cock Palaeornis
Parrakeets had wintered out of doors and stood the severe weather
extremely well. There are only two satisfactory ways of wintering
valuable Parrakeets in captivity : If there is a good chance of their
standing the cold, put them in a sunny, unheated aviary whose flight
communicates with an open shed, one half of the front of which is
boarded up from roof to ground. In this way you get shelter from
wind and wet without draughts or sudden changes of temperature.
If the birds are delicate, put them in roomy cages, protected by a
shield on the back and two sides, and keep them at a high, even
temperature. If you are asking for trouble try a room with a
moderate and varying temperature, or a heated aviary with an
outdoor flight attached.
The three pairs of Stanleys hatched and reared five, three, and
two young respectively, but did not nest a second time.

chick each. One was reared ; the other was accidentally crushed by
its parents, who were wild and clumsy.
The Pileated hatched two strong chicks, but, to my great
disappointment, lost them when half grown--I fear through feeding
them on strawberries.
It is noteworthy that Stanleys, Barrabands, and Pileated have
invariably failed to hatch their eggs with me when the cock birds
have been caged during the winter, even though they have appeared
in the most vigorous breeding condition and perfect plumage.
The Queen Alexandras were also a disappointment, the cock
alone coming into breeding condition.
The cock Bauer, who has never forgiven me for depriving him
of the wife of his heart--a Barnard---four years ago, bullied his own
mate, and fed his Stanley neighbour's. The expression of the hen
Bauer while watching this scandalous conduct was said to be very
amusing !
The Yellow-mantle and Bosella had three clear eggs only,
though in particularly fine condition and out all winter.
The Bedrumps reared four young, of which one was deformed.
The Bourkes got no further than inspecting their nest barrel,
the hen being a very shy breeder and a nervous sitter.
When the other Grass Parrakeets were first turned out an
unlucky thunderstorm gave one pair of Bluewings the excuse (for
which members of their family are ever on the lookout) of killing
themselves against the side of their enclosure. I then locked the
stable door by giving the aviaries an inner lining of string netting,
and at the time of writing one pair have four well-grown young in
the nest 5 &amp;quot; and the others eggs, which, however, I fear are overdue to
hatch. Two pairs which shared the same aviary did not quarrel,
though the hens rather disturbed one another and broke a few eggs ;
Bourkes, however, I have found quite willing to murder one another
in the breeding season if more than a single pair are kept together.
A propos of string netting, I may say that I have never had accidents
through its use as one might expect, since Neophema Parrakeets
never bite anything, nor do they settle on vertical surfaces and climb
about.

One of the cock Guiana Parrotlets died when the hen was
beginning to use the nest-box; the other pair broke or ate their eggs.
The Indian Ringneck nested in a small indoor flight, but her
seven eggs, though all fertile, failed to hatch. Last year, when the
cock also was wintered indoors, the eggs were clear.
The African Ringnecks paired but did not nest, and the
Blossom-heads did likewise. Last year the hen, perverse bird ! laid
and incubated but refused to pair.
The Lorikeets broke their eggs through playing in the nest.
The Hooded, which are among the few Australian birds which
do not accommodate themselves to our seasons, began to moult as
soon as they were turned out. One hen, however, has just started to
sit on five eggs, :: and there is a chance of getting something from the
others when they have been turned loose in a warm room. To allow
Hooded to lay at a low temperature is almost certain to mean
egg-binding and loss of the hens.
A pair of Western Black Cockatoos have been feeding each
other, but as they must come indoors this month there can be no
hope of breeding results.
My three New Zealand Parrakeets have caused me to regret
the day I purchased them for a big figure. I had heard that the
species was prolific and gentle. Well, mine weren't! As the pair --
brother and sister who had never been separated -- were on the worst
of terms, I turned the hen into an aviary with my old cock. He
murdered her a fortnight later, and not long afterwards the second
cock died as well. No. 1 is as savage with other birds as with his
own kind, and were he not so rare I would gladly part with him !

African Sunbirds.
I was able to start for home with a pair of Malachite Sunbirds and
a pair of Lesser Double-collared Sunbirds, the smallest of the South
African species, I believe ; the latter, at the time of writing -- May--
being in perfect condition, the cock in full colour and singing all
day, his beautiful green head, neck, and back glistening in the sun,-
looking almost as if they were wet, the steel blue band across his
chest making a splendid contrast with the broader scarlet band.
The hen is a sober little grey bird.
I am sorry to relate I lost the hen Malachite Sunbird in the
Tropics owing to the exceptional heat we had on that voyage. The
butcher's shop, where the birds have to travel, was lit artificially,
and the heat almost unbearable, so I got permission from the
captain to hang the cages under the awning on the upper deck,
but the heat seemed to beat through the canvas, and it was as bad
as being below. All the birds were sitting with their beaks open,
panting, and while I was wondering what I could do, the hen
Malachite reeled off her perch in a fit, and was dead in a few
seconds.* I sprayed the remaining three with water, and asked if I
could not be allowed to have them in my cabin, but I was told it was
impossible. Regulations, rules, must be upheld, so back they had
to go to the inferno below.
The next day, when I went to feed them, the cock Malachite
was too weak to get on his perch, so I took them along to my cabin
and fed them there, in the daylight. The Malachite revived, and I
suddenly realised the bird would not feed by gaslight, and so only
had four hours of daylight out of the twenty-four while he was with
me. To make a long story short--well, I cannot tell you exactly
where he spent the remaining ten days of the voyage, but there was
a hook over the sofa in the cabin, from which my dresses were
suspended, and he seemed to enjoy disappearing into the folds of
these dresses while the captain made his daily inspection of the
cabins. Anyway, he never saw the butcher's shop again! and
managed to live till I got him to London, where, thanks to timely
hints from Mr. Ezra and the Comte de Segur, I was able to give
him the warmth and live food he needed.
He is now in splendid health and condition, though out of

colour, singing all day, and on warm days (which is not very often
so far) enjoys a fly in the garden aviary, where it is very interest-
ing to watch him catching insects on the wing. I feed him on
condensed milk, crumbled sponge cake, honey, Mellin's Food, or
Horlick's Malted Milk, and Marmite, any live insects I can find, and
grapes. He lives in a 3-foot cage with natural boughs for perches,
in a temperature of about 58* to 60*, coming out for a fly round the
room the days it is not warm enough to take him out of doors.
Words cannot describe the beauty of these birds in full
colour, hut those who visited the L.C.B.A. Show in November last
will remember the wonderful team of sunbirds shown by Mr. Ezra,
the Malachite Sunbird being one. The hen is a dark grey bird with
a yellow breast, and strange spots on the throat that remind one of
a lizard. They are most tractable and make charming pets, nibbling
the end of one's fingers, hoping for spiders or other insects, of which
they are very fond.

I bought him in Poole Park and carried him home in a paper
bag ! Passing through on my way to Poole, I had noticed a pair
of magpies bullying a third one. Mentioning to the keeper how
unhappy the bird looked, " Yes," he said, " I would gladly have
half-a-crown for him and be rid of him ! " " Then," said I, " I think
I had better have him." So I called on my way from Poole and took
the bird home with me.
In a nice large aviary, with an aged and amiable Gold
Pheasant for company, " Jack " settled down quickly, and became
very attached to me. Although I had been assured he was a " bit
wild " and not at all tame, he appeared to me just the reverse.
In the course of a few days a friend saw him, and on her
saying she had long wanted a magpie, I gave him to her, for I
already had a second, older and finer than "Jack," and I knew he
would have a good home. To my surprise, after four days, my
friend brought him back, for he had moped all the time, and would
scarcely eat. "It is you he wants," she said, " for he has plenty of

at once and fussed about, making much of me, and showing his joy
in every possible way.
He was such a dear, confiding bird, that I felt it would be
very nice to give him his liberty, so after a week or so I left the
aviary door open, in spite of my husband saying, " He will be off,
and you will never see him again ! " But no ; "Jack " trusted me,
as I trusted him. He just took a short fly, then came back and
settled on his perch contentedly.
That was just five years ago, and since then the door has been
left open all day, for him to go in and out as he likes, which is what
the pheasant is accustomed to do.
At first he always came in to sleep, but each spring for the
last three years he has built a nest (bachelor as he is!) on the
window-sill of a small staircase window, which he prefers as a
sleeping place. In the nests I have seen pheasants' feathers, bits
of bright coloured wool, pins and hairpins, and once a small photo-
graph ! I don't think he has carried off anything more valuable,
although he goes into all the rooms in turn. Not only is he so tame
as to fly on my lap or shoulder to be fed or caressed, but he has no
fear of guests, and one friend who was fond of lying on the lawn on
a sunny day constantly had his boots unlaced for him by this
impudent magpie, who is also fond of slyly pulling the pheasants'
tails and flying off with a bit of favourite pudding from under the
Trumpeter's very beak ! For my French poodle he has more respect,
but is not afraid of her.
No magpie could look in better health and plumage, for none
could live under better conditions. He has a pond to bathe in,
plenty of fruit and insects in the garden, and his " food " consists
of scraps of raw meat, pudding, and cheese. His tameness seems
to increase, in spite of the liberty he has, and I could catch and
shut him up at any time if I wished to do so. It is an ideal way
of keeping a magpie; he loves watching all that goes on in the
house, and appears always happy and interested.

"Jack" tapping with his beak on the glass of the window to call
us ; and if I look out at night, I see him sleeping on his nest, with
his tail erect, resting against the pane.
Perhaps this little account may interest someone who keeps
a magpie. They may consider whether they should give their bird
freedom, as I do, which must make its life far happier than being in
an aviary, however large. If so, the magpie must be tamed, and have
perfect confidence in its owner first.
SPOONBILLS.
By J. H. Gurney, E.Z.S.
(Reprinted from ' The Zoologist.')
In the opinion of the late Professor Newton, the Spoonbill
was in former days in the fullest sense of the word a native of
England, and there is no reason why it should not become so again.
Accordingly, throughout the summer, protection has been afforded to
any which had the good sense to avail themselves of a sanctuary on
Breydon&apos;mud-flats. One longs for the time when a pair or two of
these splendid birds may again breed at Reedham, where there is a
wood admirably suited to them, in preference to the marshes of
Holland. Mr. S. H. Long, who has recently been in that country,
kindly obtained from the Secretary of the Netherlands Protection
Society some particulars about the laws enforced there, which are
somewhat strict and require to he observed by visitors. It appears
that for many years there have only been two, or at the most three,
carefully watched Spoonbill settlements in Holland, which at the
present time are situated as follows, viz.: one on the Naardermeer,
near Amsterdam, where there were ninety protected pairs of Spoon-
bills nesting in 1913, and one at Zwanenwater, near Helder, where
about a hundred and fifty pairs were nesting. I learn from Mr. Long
that, by applying in the proper quarter, leave can be obtained to
visit Naardermeer, but Zwanenwater is barred a like to natives and
foreigners. Of the two places, Zwanenwater is slightly the nearest
to Norfolk, its position on the map lying a little to the south-east of
the latitude of Breydon.

Spoonbills.
Looking back some two hundred and fifty years, it is with a
feeling of curiosity that we remember that in June, 1663, the
botanical studies which John Ray was prosecuting with such vigour
took him and his pupil Willughby to Holland, where they found
Spoonbills breeding near a village called Sevenhuys, situated at four
leagues (about thirteen miles) from Leyden, not in marshes but as
they did in Norfolk, " in great numbers on the top of high trees "
(' Ornithology,' p. 289). This settlement, from which the young
Spoonbill described by Willughby was probably taken, has long
since become extinct, for even in Pennant's time the wood where
Willughby saw them breeding had been cut down (' British Zoology,'
ii, p. 634). At the present day this would have been of less con-
sequence, for trees do not seem to be required, piled-up reeds being
preferred by European Spoonbills, which, like Herons, vary consider-
ably in their habits. A somewhat fuller account of this visit to
Sevenhuys, and of the four species, including the " Lepelaers," as
Spoonbills were called in Dutch, found breeding there, is supplied by
Ray in his journal of ' Travels through the Low Countries ' (second
edition, 1738, p. 33), one of the very few references to Natural
History to be discovered in that somewhat disappointing volume.
Allusion has already been made to the protection which our
ill-supported Society &amp;quot; still continues to afford to Spoonbills, a pro-
tection of which this year twelve availed themselves. The first one
to be viewed on the mud-flats was rather early, appearing on April
7th, but Dr. Long tells me they come to Holland much earlier than
this. In all probability its presence was due to a strong west wind
(W., force 5) which had been blowing on the previous evening. It
was evidently contented with the society of Gulls and their muddy
surroundings, and it remained in the creeks, except for short absences
when they were covered up and it could not feed, until the 14th.
After an interval of six weeks, another turned up on June 2nd (W.,
2), and this was joined by three more on the 3rd (N., 2), all in fine
plumage, exhibiting white " copped crownes," as Sir Thomas Browne
would have said, in allusion to their pendent plumes. They were
tame enough to feed within fifty yards of the Watcher&apos;s houseboat,

and I regretted an engagement prevented my going over to see them.
All four took their departure on the 7th (W., 2), but on the 18th (S.,
1) three of them came back again. Mr. Patterson, who had an
opportunity of watching, thinks they were feeding on sand shrimps
and ditch prawns, which is very probable, as Sheppard and Whitear
remark that one killed on Breydon was full of the shells of shrimps,
and another which I had several years ago (October, 1871) had also
good-sized shrimps in its stomach. Mr. Jary does not say how long
these three stayed, but on July 4th another was seen, which he
considered to be a young one, and if so, a bird of the year. On the
31st there were again three (W., 1), which may have been the trio
first seen on June 2nd. On August 2nd two Spoonbills were
remarked flying out to sea by Mr. F. Chasen, perhaps on their way
to Naardermeer, as the following day none were visible on Breydon
Broad. However, one came back on the 4th (W., 2), after which the
Watcher, who has supplied nearly all the above memoranda, saw no
more. Breydon is the only one of the Norfolk Broads which Spoon-
bills habitually visit, none of the others being tidal. Now and then,
however, one is seen on Hickling Broad, probably in search of
sticklebacks (see ' Zoologist,' 1866, p. 348). *

By Dr. E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.A.
The following is mainly a translation of what Dr. Russ calls
" a short historical survey of the history of bird-keeping from the
earliest days up to the present time," which that writer gives in the
introductory pages of vol. iv of his great storehouse of information
on cage birds, ' Die Fremdlandischen Stubenvogel.' This is also
supplemented by further translation from the third volume of the
same work, by quotations from other sources and by a few additional
notes.
The translation is as accurate a one as I can produce, though
in places not quite literal, where the author's use of idiomatic or
colloquial forms of speech is beyond me. I think, however, that it

always gives his meaning, and at any rate, as far as I am concerned,
it is now too late to think of any change, for the translation was
made some years ago, when I knew more German than I know or
want to know 7 now.
Dr. Russ, starting from the very beginning of things, writes
(iv, p. 2) :
" In the Bible ornamental birds (' Sckmuckvogel ') are several times
mentioned. As early as the time of Noah, the Dove was undoubtedly a
common house-bird. In the Book of Kings (i, 10, 22) and in Chronicles (ii,
9, 21) it is related that King Solomon brought in his ships from Ophir gold,
silver, ivory, apes and peacocks.* Although we have but little information as
to the development of bird-culture in China, it is certain that there, as well as
in Japan, the cult of living animals has been in vogue for thousands of years.
Three thousand years ago there were certainly Chinese Zoological Gardens, and
the domesticated small birds, which we nowadays import from that country,
the white Java Sparrows and the white Japanese Mannikins [he. the 'Ben-
galis.'-- E. H.] show clearly that aviculture was known there from remote
ages.
"The legends of the Greeks say that the Argonauts (1350 b.c.) brought
back with them to their own country the Pheasant from the River Phasis in
Colchis; from the Greeks the cult reached Rome, where and whence it spread
rapidly. A good deal later the Gold Pheasant was imported and was no doubt
the origin of the well-known fable of the Phoenix, on account of the gleaming
red colour of its plumage. In the time of Pericles, in the fifth century before
Christ, the Peacock was so extremely rare in Greece, that, as Athenaeus
relates, people came immense distances to see a pair which a citizen of Athens
possessed. iElian says that at first Peacocks were exhibited for money, and the
orator Antiphon, a contemporary of Pericles, mentions in this connection that
the price of a pair was a thousand drachmae, that is, a thousand marks of our
money. In the temple of Juno at Samos Peacocks were kept as sacred birds
and their portraits are to be seen on Samian coins. Alexander the Great saw
them in India and admired their beauty so much that he threatened to inflict
the severest punishment on anyone who dared to kill these birds. Among the
Romans, we learn from various sources that, as early as 116 a.d.. one, Marcus
Aubdius Lurko, was carrying on Peafowl breeding on a large scale, his annual
profits being said to be 60,000 sestertia (9540 marks). In those days, too,
Parrots were highly valued, and those which could talk were among the most
prized luxuries in demand among the grand ladies of Rome, who also kept
white Blackbirds and other rare birds, while Pliny tells us that Agrippina, the
wife of the Emperor Claudius, possessed a Blackbird which was gifted with
speech."
* Bird-catching and fowlers are also frequently mentioned ; in Jeremiah is a
reference to " a cage full of birds," the capture of Sparrows for food was
commonly practised, and the sellers of Doves in the Temple are familiar to
all. but whether the old Israelites kept birds for other than culinary and
sacrificial purposes, must be considered at least doubtful. -- E. H.

In his Parrot volume (iii) Dr. Russ gives more details of the
early history of this bird, which it will be convenient to deal with.
He writes (p. 6):
"The old Egyptians did not know the Parrots and in their hiero-
glyphics we find no sign or any indication of them. In like case were the
Israelites, at any rate research shows that the name of Parrot is never once
mentioned in the Bible. In the time of Alexander the Great they were intro-
duced into Greece, for we are told, though there is some doubt about the
correctness of this statement, that one of his retinue brought with him from
India a species of Parrot, which he found was commonly kept tame among
the natives there. This species, according to Wagler, was the Psittacus
eupatrius of Linnasus, now popularly known as the ' Large Alexandrine
Parrakeet.'
" As Aristotle [see Sundevall, ' Thierarten des Aristoteles ' (Stockholm,
863) and Lenz, ' Zoologie der alten Grieehen und Bonier ' (Gotha, 856)], gives
such a very short description of the Parrots, we may assume that he had but
very raiely seen one, for otherwise such a painstaking author as he would have
given a more satisfactory account. It was the Ring-neciced Parrakeet (P.
torquatus, Bodd.), also commonly nowadays known as the Small Alexan-
drine, which the Romans knew, for this species was discovered in farthest
Syria by Diodorus Siculus, a contemporary of Julius Ciesar and Augustus, and
accurately described by Pliny, the first real description of a Parrot we have.
Martial tells us that they were kept in costly cages of silver, ebony and tortoise-
shell, and were taught to speak human words, especially the name of Ciesar.
For their training special teachers were appointed and the price of a well-
trained bird often exceeded that of a slave." *
" On this the stern Censor, Marcus Portius Cato, thus chides them, 'O
* As regards this training Pliny's account is interesting, as given by Turner, the
earliest English writer on birds, in his ' Historia avium,' 1544. This I take
from Mr. A. N. Evans' 'Turner on Birds,' Cambridge, 1903, p. 151:
"Beyond all, Psittaci repeat men's words, and even talk connectedly.
India sends this bird, which they call Psitace, with the whole body green
marked only by a scarlet ring upon the nape. It will pronounce ' Hail
Emperor,' and any words it hears; it is especially sportive after wine.
The hardness of the head is the same as of the beak, and when the bird is
being taught to speak, it is beaten with an iron rod, else it leels not the
strokes. When it flies down it receives its weight upon its beak, and sup-
ports itself thereon; and thus lightens itself to remedy the weakness of its
feet.&apos;' May we not take this account of what Parrots said in those days to
support as far as it goes the modern idea as to what was the Roman pro-
nunciation of Latin. One can imagine a Parrot saying, " Kaiser, Kesar, or
Kisar " perfectly ; in fact, " A'we Kiser " is a parrot-language sentence pure
and simple, which is still doing duty as " Kiss me," " Do kiss me," or " You
kissy," but I have yet to hear a Parrot say, " Ave Ciesar " (" Evy SIsar ") as
I was taught in my schooldays. An initial S-sound seems beyond them, but
the hard K suits their voice to perfection ; I had almost said to a T.

Dr. E. Hopkinson
ye Senators ! 0 unhappy Rome! What does this portend ? On what ev
times have we fallen, when we see our wives nursing puppy dogs on their laps
and our men carrying Parrots in their hands ! ' In how great esteem were
these birds then held, is shown by the fact that the poet Ovid wrote an elegy*
on Corinna's dead Parrot, while later on Statius glorified another in a similar
way. Then, as now, only the young were selected for instruction. So we
learn from Apuleius and we may assume that frequently mentioned Ringneck
was the only species known in ancient days. Kiranides describes one of these,
but one in which the ring was lacking [ i.e . a hen or young bird. -- E. H.].
Aelian tells us that in India there were many Parrots, which were held sacred
by the Brahmans, because they could imitate human speech, and which were
therefore neither killed nor captured by the Indians. By the time of the
Emperor Nero Parrots had been discovered (' bei Tergedum ') on the Nile, and
were probably afterwards imported in gradually increasing numbers from
Africa into Europe, as has been the case with many of our domestic animals
and birds, which originally came from foreign parts. The notorious glutton,
the Emperor Heliogabalus, Aelius Lampridius relates, had dressed Parrot
heads served at his banquets and even fed his lions on Parrots and Peacocks.
From this it is clear that these birds must have been then imported in vast
numbers."
We will now leave the Parrots awhile and return to vol. iv,
and what Dr. Buss has to say there on other birds in the days of
Borne, just incidentally referring to what every school-boy knows,
another item on the imperial and plutocratic menus of the time--
Nightingale tongues. He continues thus :
"In their parks the Romans kept various kinds of ornamental fowl --
Flariringos, Purple Gallinules, Cranes and other Water and Game Birds, for in
those days it was the larger sorts which were the special favourites and the
Parrots were the only representatives of our present day chamber birds. The
methods and objects too of the bird-fanciers of those days were radically
different from those of to-day. The inherent roughness and unbounded love of
gain in the Romans of the Decline made them see only one objective in the
pets they kept and reared, namely the filling of their own bellies. To quote an
instance of this horrid characteristic of theirs, we hear that it gave the actor
Aesop the greatest pleasure to eat the best singing and talking birds, because
they were like men, and that on one occasion he had prepared a dish, the
contents of which were nothing but the most famous feathered singers and
talkers. The price of each of these was 6000 sestertia, so that the cost of the
whole dish must have come to about 100,000 S. His son was an even worse
waster than he was, for not only did he buy only the costliest birds, but would
only drink wine in which pearls of price had been dissolved. The gor-
mandising Emperor, Heliogabalus, regaled himself at his banquets on the
combs of living cocks and the tongues of Peafowl and Parrots. The self-
indulgence of the Romans led to even the smallest birds being made to
* " ' Psittacus, Eois imitatrix ales ab oris, Occidit.'

minister to their pleasures and the demands of their dainty appetites, which
they tried by every possible means to satisfy. Lucullus had an aviary built in
his dining hall, so that when the dishes of cooked birds were brought in at his
banquets, he could at the same time watch the living ones and enjoy their
colours, movements and gambols. This Roman also had, Varro states, an
' Ornithon ' (bird-house), which was so large that it could hold a thousand
Fieldfares,* Blackbirds, Ortolans and Quails, which were fattened on a paste
made of figs and meal. The writers of those times give very complete descrip-
tions of these bird-houses and the methods of fattening employed, and we
learn tha t in the state butcheries there were commonly special cages to let on
hire, in which birds were fattened up before sale."
A full account of these old Roman bird-houses is to be found
in an old book, ' The Architecture of Birds,' published in 1831 under
the superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Know-
ledge, but without any author's name on the front page. This
account has no apparent connection with the title of the book, but is
quite interesting, and well supplements what Dr. Russ has to tell us,
to much of which, too, the same objection might be made--that
instead of dealing with the early days of real aviculture, it is much
more a record of ancient poultry-yards and food supplies. But let
that pass, and we will see what our anonymous friend of 1831 has
to say about these " voleries," as he calls them. He tells us that his
information is derived from the writings of Varro and Columella, and
writes as follows:
"Each of these voleries contained many thousand Thrushes and Black-
birds, besides other birds excellent for eating, such as Quails and Ortolans. So
numerous were these voleries in the vicinity of Rome, and in the teiritory of
the Sabines, that the dung of the thrushes was employed to manure the lands,
and what is remarkable to fatten oxen and hogs.f These Thrushes had little
liberty in their prisons, for they were never suffered to go abroad, and they laid
no eggs ; + but as they were supplied with abundance of choice food, they
fattened to the great profit of the proprietor. Each fat thrush, except at the
time of migration, sold for three denarii, equal to about two shillings sterling;
and on the occasion of a triumph or public festival, this sort of trade yielded a
profit of twelve hundred per cent. The voleries were a kind of vaulted courts,
the inside furnished with a number of roosts. The door was very low ; the
* Russ' word is " Krammetsvogel " (= Fieldfare), but he probably meant Thrushes,
f Had the writer been a bird fancier he would have seen nothing remarkable in this.
The half-digested remains of the fig and meal paste would form a most
fattening food for animals, and one which would be readily eaten by cattle,
much more so by pigs.
+ Were either of these likely? This author was certainly not a bird fancier. --

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
windows very few. and placed in such a manner as to prevent the captives from
seeing the fields, the woods, the birds fluttering at liberty, or whatever might
awake their sensibility, and disturb the calm so conducive to corpulence. A
little glimmering was sufficient to direct them to their food, which consisted of
millet and a sort of paste made of figs and flour. They had also given them
the berries of thelentisk,* of the myrtle, of the ivy, and whatever, in short,
would improve the delicacy and flavour of their flesh. They were supplied with
a little stream of water, which ran in a gutter through the volerie. Twenty
days before they were intended for killing, their allowance was augmented ;
nay, so far was the attention carried, that they gently removed into a little
anti-chamber the Thrushes which were plump and in good order, to enjoy
more quiet; and, frequently, to heighten the illusion, they hung bowers and
verdure, imitating natural scenery, so that the birds might fancy themselves in
the midst of the woods. In short, they treated their slaves well, because they
knew their interest. Such as were newly caught were put in small separate
voleries, along with others which had been accustomed to confinement; and
every contrivance, every soothing art was employed to habituate them some-
what to bondage; yet these birds were never completely tamed."
We will now return to Russ, who writes that the first of these
bird-houses was, according to Pliny, that built by Marcus Laenius
Strabo, and goes on to say that --
since his time, authors have lamented, that the custom has grown up of
keeping in prisons animals which Nature intended to live out their lives in
freedom."
He next introduces us to Alexander Severus, the successor of
Heliogabalus, whom he calls --
" a noteworthy bird-fancier according to our ideas, a true animal-lover in the
best sense of the words, who kept dogs, cats and other four-footed pets, as well
as birds, the latter in great numbers, for instance his collection of Doves
numbered some 20,000 head. All his birds were most carefully kept and
tended for the sole purpose of facilitating the observation of their life-habits
and ways."
But surely 20,000 head was rather a large number for the
purposes of study only, and one can hardly believe that Severus had
not, like his contemporaries, the kitchen and the banqueting hall in
view as the proper end, sooner or later, of his feathered captives.
Our author then continues :
" Ancient Rome soon became for other reasons the headquarters of the
importation of live stock from all parts. For the great combats of the arena
thousands of wild beasts were brought over and this necessitated hunting and
catching expeditions to all parts of the then known world. With these vast

numbers of the larger animals there must also have come a certain number of
Parrots and other ornamental birds. The downfall of Rome, however, put an
end to all this and the wild beast trade and import practically ceased for
centuries; at any rate [we turn again to the Parrot volume, p. 7.--E. PE],
information on this period fails us, or the little there is at our disposal is only
most vague and traditionary. We know that at the time of the Crusades
Parrots were becoming known throughout Europe and were to be found in
ornamental cages in the palaces of Princes and the more wealthy. The ladies
of the period (the Middle Ages) had their Parrots, their " Mignons," with
which to console and amuse themselves in their loneliness, while their knights
were away at the wars ; and we hear also of Parrots even in the cloister, where
they would seem quite out of place, even if they could babble bits of the Bible
and the Prayers."
With the last sentence we have got back again to vol. iv, and
will continue the translation from the place where we broke off
(p. 4):
"As navigation improved and wider voyages of discovery were mado,
sailors began to bring back birds with them. Moreover, as Ferdinand Cortes
relates, wild beast-keeping was in great vogue among the aboriginal inhabitants
of America. The Emperor Montezuma had a zoological park on such a grand
scale that &lt;500 keepers were needed for the care of the animals. Talking
Parrots were particularly beloved and the natives were well advanced in their
knowledge of these. Among the most valuable acquisitions, the results of his
voyage, which Columbus brought home were some of the large gaudy Macaws.
The rich merchants of Augsburg of the loth and 16th centuries were accus -
tomed to keep numerous Parrots and other foreign birds in their mansions,
and at about the same period, so Piccolimini writes, in Vienna so many
Parrots and other birds, both native and foreign, vvere kept either in the rooms
or summer-houses, that when walking through the streets, one could imagine
oneself in the woods, so lusty were their songs and calls. Very shortly after
this came the Canary * ... to rapidly spread through Europe and more
particularly Germany. Finally with the commencement of the 17th century
began, first in Portuguese ships, the importation from Senegal of the small
African birds, which are to-day everywhere known and loved under the name
of ' Ornamental Finches.' Very shortly the Spaniards, French and Dutch
got the chief part of this trade, which was already by the middle of the same
century a most flourishing one, and later the English, Germans, Americans
and others took their share of it, till the very extensive bird market of to-day
was established."
We have now followed Dr. Russ from Noah until to-day, and
in taking leave of him may conclude with the few further details of
the growth of the import trade, which is to be found in the Parrot
volume, when he writes :
* " Imported into Europe very early in the sixteenth century." -- Newton, ' Diet.
Birds,' p. 71.

Aviary notes for 1917.
" It is fairly certain that in the 14th and 15th centuries birds were
imported into Europe by the Venetians and Portuguese, in whose hands the
trade with the Indies then was. We know that the last-named in the year
1498 rounded the Cape of Good Hope and eventually possessed themselves of a
great part of India and the island of Ceylon, whence they brought to Europe
Indian Parrots, which they found already tamed by the natives of that country.
The same was the case when the Spaniards discovered America ; they also
found the aborigines keeping tame Parrots. When Columbus made his solemn
entry into Seville on his return from his first expedition, he had with him,
among other valuables, some living Parrots. So also the English on their
voyages to the New World brought home with them--first in 1504 -- live
Parrots, which were at first considered great curiosities in that country. Later
on however as the result of keen search, they were brought to Europe from
America in larger numbers, and among them even the big Macaws were
included, birds which were at that time thought fit to grace only princely
houses."
Our authority then goes on to the writings of Aldrovancli,
Gesner, and other naturalists of the time, and with these we may
fitly leave him, as they belong to quite another chapter in the book
of aviculture.

in the uncovered flight, has come into glorious colour.
The Yellow-rumped Serin is hesitating between a hen Gold-
finch and a hen Bullfinch, but the latter is not at all of an oncoming
disposition. I think he may have a better chance with the Gold-

connection with these notes, which I, unfortunately, can do in one
word-- nil !
The Eagle Owl went to nest three times, and sat steadily for
the full period on each clutch, but nothing hatched out, greatly to
the poor bird's disappointment. The same thing took place with the
Marble Owls in the next aviary.
The Jardine's Pigmy Owls hatched two or three young and
tended them well for a week ; then (in consequence, I fear, of too
many visitors) they devoured the whole brood.
The cold weather in April, really our third winter ! cost me
both my Yellow-winged Sugar Birds and the cock Indigo Bunting.
I have since sold the hen, who promptly went to nest with her new
owner, but did not hatch anything.
The Yellow-rumped Serin finally paired up with a hen Green-
finch, as the others would have nothing to say to him. She laid and
sat steadily, but the eggs were clear, and soon afterwards she died.
The Diamond Doves turned out to be both cocks, and fought
all day and every day.
This autumn I regretfully decided to give up keeping birds,
save only the Nightingale and my Owls. When better days come
I hope to start again, and meanwhile possess my soul in patience
and solace myself with visions of glorious successes in time to come.

The papers in the case, and the specimens submitted, were referred to me

proved to be blood feathers, that were plucked when only half developed, from
birds that evidently were either shot or trapped. It was pointed out to the Secre-
tary of the Treasury that no feather grower in his senses ever would pluck live
birds, if he had any, when the feathers were only half grown and worth only a
fraction of their value when fully developed !
Fortunately for the purposes of the inquiry, Mr. C. William Beebe, our
Curator of Birds, visited Hankow and the surrounding districts of China, while
studying the Chinese Pheasants in connection with the preparation of his monograph
on the Phasianida3. Mr. Beebe found no Eared Pheasants in captivity, could hear of
none, and returned from China absolutely certain that there is no Pheasant-raising
industry whatever in any of the portions of China that he visited.
The final decision of the Treasury Department was that the evidence sub-
mitted in support of the exporters' contention in behalf of the existence of a feather-
raising industry in China with Eared Pheasants, was by no means conclusive, and
that the claims made were not sustained.
EDITORIAL.
In this number of the Magazine considerable space has been
allotted to the Old World Vultures. Future issues will similarly deal
with special aviculture--for instance, the study of little-known
families of birds, notes on zoological garden methods at home or
abroad, the history of aviculture, applied aviculture, and so on.
Papers dealing with the usual work of the Society will be inserted as
in the past.
A number of interesting and unusual photographs have been
received, portraying rare birds or interesting phases of bird study.
From these selections will be made from time to time, as funds
permit.
In the January number space will be devoted to Australian
and New Zealand birds. A unique photograph of a running Apteryx
will appear in this issue. G. R.

A UNIQUE PHOTOGRAPH.
We have pleasure in publishing herewith the photograph of
a running Apteryx promised last month. Careful search through
Apteryx literature has revealed many excellent studies of these birds--
standing, stooping, or crouching--but none of them portrays the
curious, characteristic running pose shown in our illustration. Our
member, Mr. G. E. Low, has made a unique contribution to aviculture.
Mr. Low writes regarding this bird : " He dwelt many years
ago in the Dublin Zoo. I well remember the keeper taking him out
of bed to be photographed. He resented this very much, and would
not sit. So I said to the keeper--' If he won't sit let him run,' and
indicated the line I wanted him to take. The photo is the result of
this."
All such photographs of rare birds threatened with extinction
are of the utmost value. What would one not give for similar records
of the life of the Great Auk, of the Labrador Duck, of the unwieldy
Dodo, or the vanished Moa &apos;? The Pigeon Hollandais has gone never
to return ; and, though another species now bears its name and
keeps its memory green, the extinct form has disappeared almost
unrecorded by the pen and utterly unrecorded by the camera.
The accurate nature photographer can render great service to
zoology. G. R.

NOTES ON THE EGG OF MANTELL'S

In May last the writer examined a female Apteryx in the
London Zoological Gardens. The bird was languid and apparently
out of sorts, and the keeper said she had been wandering about in
the daytime, contrary to her habit.* On being released, she made
no attempt to run under the straw, as is usual with these birds, but
stood quite still, with the head turned to the left--an attitude, by
the way, which has been admirably rendered in a stuffed example
recently adorning the window of Rowland Ward, Ltd. On water
being offered she drank at once, but still made no effort to run away.
She exhibited, in fact, all the dulness and sluggishness which charac-
terises these birds on the eve of egg-laying--probably on account of
the enormous size of the egg. On May 8th the egg was duly laid, and,
by the courtesy of the Zoological Society and Mr. Seth-Smith, has
passed into the writer's possession. In view of the rarity of speci-
mens of late years, it may be well to call attention to its characters

and structure.
(1) As regards size, the specimen measures 5 |x 4 in.
(2) The shape is the usual elliptical form, there being but
little difference between the large and small ends. Some eggs are
quite ovoid (Kirk), being wide in the middle and narrowing towards
each pole; but this is not one of them.
(3) On extrusion, the egg weighed 11 |oz.--probably on account
of the bird being old, as she had been in the Zoo over eleven years,
having formed part of the great Apteryx consignment brought over in
1905.t [The smallest egg collected by Sir W. Buffer, it may be
remembered, weighed only 111 oz., while his largest weighed
15- |oz.] The specimen described in this paper was clear, but so

the species, for Apteryxes have been known to come out voluntarily to bask
in the sun. Other nocturnal species, such as Owls, have a similar habit in
the daytime.
 |On June 26th, 1905, no less than eleven Mantell's Apteryxes were received at the
Zoo. Seven were the gift of the Government of New Zealand and Mr. H. C.
Wilkie ; four were presented by the Earl of Banfurly. The entire consign-
ment had been brought safely to England by Mr. Wilkie.

was the first example laid in the Zoo (June 9th, 1859), yet the egg
of 1859 weighed 14 \ oz. It is thus probable that the advanced age of
the bird accounts for the lightness of the present specimen.
(4) Structurally the egg is very thin-shelled; it is glossy like
porcelain, and smooth to the touch, though minute examination
shows the surface to he dotted all over with tiny pits. At the
large end there are several raised hair-like lines, and a few minute
raised tubercles, such as also ccur in Apteryx oweni.
(5) A faint pink colour is noticeable, especially on holding
the egg up to the light and viewing the interior through the blow-
hole. This pink hue is apparently only found in clear eggs, never in
incubated ones ; but European aviculturists seem unlikely to be able
to confirm this theory, as no fertile eggs seem to have been laid in
this country, whether at the Zoo or elsewhere. The pink hue is
very delicate, difficult to recognise by artificial light, and possibly
fugitive at best; nevertheless, it does certainly occur, and the eggs
of Mantell's Apteryx are by no means of the dull-white, green-grey,
or pale yellowish hue stated in text-books.

By R. T. Littlejohns and S. A. Lawrence.
To many aviculturists in the Mother Country the subject of
this paper will be familiar. The White-browed Wood Swallow has
been introduced into English aviaries apparently with a good measure
of success. &amp;quot; The writers, as photographers and observers, have had
a fair experience of the bird in the wild state, and the following notes
on its habits have been gathered during wanderings within a few
miles of Melbourne.
The White-browed is one of three species of Wood Swallow
which nest annually in this south-eastern extremity of the continent.
One of the other two species remains in the locality all the year
round, but the White-browed and the third species are summer

1909.--G. R.]

R. T. Littlejohns ancl S. A. Lawrence,
visitors only. Some years also they appear in greater numbers than
in others. They usually arrive in the month of November, and
journey north again soon after rearing their broods. The species
under review is gregarious, always travelling and hunting in flocks.
At nesting-time even the flock does not break up entirely, although
the nests are built far enough apart to ensure each nesting pair a
distinct territory of its own.
It is quite evident that a colony of birds will return to the
same locality to nest year after year. On this account the writers,
who have a very soft spot for these graceful birds, make it an annual
practice, no matter what other urgent business is afoot, to pay at least
one visit to a picturesque little spot known between them as the
" Wood Swallow Paddock." It is a grassy paddock intersected by
two small gullies forming a Y&amp;gt; and covered with a six-foot growth
of native and introduced bushes--very quiet and undisturbed not-
withstanding the fact that the heart of the city is only twelve miles
away by rail. The white skeletons of ring-barked gum-trees dotted at
intervals complete a picture evidently as attractive to the birds as
to ourselves. Here, in the area of five or six acres, one is sure to
find, a few weeks before Christmas, upwards of a dozen families busy
with their nestlings. The anxiety we feel each year as to wdiether
the birds have chosen other pastures is dispelled by the notes of
alarm as the paddock is reached. The location of the several nests
is always an easy matter. As previously mentioned, each pair of
birds jealously guards a fixed area surrounding its own nest. In
every case this area contains a dead tree, and from the bare limbs of
this point of vantage attacks are made on the intruder the moment
he crosses the invisible frontier. The nearer to the nest the greater
becomes the fury of the attack, an unfailing " hot or cold " tell-tale
soon pointing out the conspicuous nest. So dearly do the birds hold
to their theory of a look-out and a surrounding allotment that not
one case has been noted in this particular colony wdiere a nest was
not associated with a dead tree. Further, each pair minds its own
business and leaves the intruder wdrolly to the fury of the next family
as soon as he passes out of their own domain. We have never,
except when experimenting as described later, been attacked by more
than one pair of birds at one time. Should a Wood Swallow trespass.

on his neighbour's estate, he is very suddenly and surely reminded
that his own part of the world is safer.
A comparison of the contents of all the nests invariably shows
that the whole flock commence nesting at the same time. If half-
fledged young are found in the first nest it is quite safe to expect the
same all round. On one or two occasions one pair, apparently over-
taken by misfortune on the first attempt, has been found a week or
more behind the others.
The nest is a shallow structure, usually composed of twigs,
grasses, and fine roots, bearing the unmistakable imprint of hasty
construction. Building operations take, on an average, about three
days. The position chosen also indicates a certain amount of care-
lessness. Any small hush, straggling or otherwise, is availed of, and
the nest dumped in an upright fork or on a horizontal branch. Very
often it is easily discernible from a hundred yards off. The eggs,
most often two in number, are of a slaty stone colour, heavily blotched
with darker markings.* One of the photographs reproduced gives
a fair impression of the class of shrub selected, the general build of
the nest, and the appearance of the eggs. It will be noticed that one
of the eggs shown is of unusual shape, being much longer than the
other, which was a normal one. This was very noticeable in the eggs
themselves.! It was quite a disappointment to find on a subsequent
visit that apparently the business part of the egg was normal, as the
chicks were identical. Both parents take part in incubation and in
the feeding of the young. The eggs hatch in about twelve days, and at
the end of another twelve the nestlings are well covered with streaked
light grey feathers, and are showing a strong inclination to be moving.
They are fed throughout on insects obtained in the air and on the
ground. The wisdom of the grey-streaked plumage of the young
becomes apparent when one searches for a family either in the dry
grass or on a dead tree. A well-maintained silence when in danger
completes their protection.

Notes on the White-browed Wood Siuallow.
The writer's attachment to these birds must certainly be for
some reason other than their trustfulness. They are about the most
difficult birds, from a photographer's point of view, that we have come
in contact with. Some small birds, after a short time, have become
so trustful as to feed their young on our hands or shoulders. Such
a thing in a wild Wood Swallow is barely imaginable. From the
time the photographer arrives until he is tired of the "fun" and
moves on to similar treatment at the next nest the irate parents
sweep down from their tree and back again almost unceasingly--a
vicious snap of the beak at camera or operator on both the outward
and the return journey. Various tricks of the trade to which most
birds will usually succumb are useless. On one occasion the young
from three different nests, labelled to show their correct addresses,
were removed to a point between the nests in the hope that there
would be one brave parent among the six, or that the greater number
interested would make them bolder. The unexpected result was a
harvest of feathers from a six-handed battle in mid-air. The human
sentiments regarding comrades in distress apparently does not apply
to Wood Swallows. The labels were hastily consulted and the causes
of the trouble returned to their respective homes. This tendency to
fight at the smallest provocation disappears as soon as the young are
safely on the wing. The augmented flock again soars in harmony,
and the feuds of nesting days are forgotten.
On two occasions only has success attended our photographic
efforts. In the first case, both birds showed up with the required
courage and actually visited the nest together. Unfortunately a ten-
shilling box camera was in use at that time, and the picture is not
wdiat it might have been. On the other occasion the apparatus was
better, but the male refused to be convinced of the harmlessness of
the camera. The female, after a couple of hours' indecision, gave the
photographers unlimited opportunities.
Notwithstanding a bad record from a photographic point of view,
the Wood Swallow cannot do otherwise than command the admira-
tion of every Nature lover. The easy, soaring flight and the charac-
teristic circular movement of the tail when at rest provide a fitting
setting for the graceful form and slaty-grey plumage. A proudly
defiant parent sitting on its small, frail nest, or a family of five on a

dry bough--three small stumps of tail doing their best to imitate the
mature swing of the other two--makes a picture sufficient to com-
pensate for many camera failures. Nor would it be correct to think
that the habits of the birds always savour of ferocity. In the course
of a day's photography there is often a vexatious delay of half an
hour while two erring parents, huddled together on their favourite
branch, express their mutual affection by a multitude of looks and
gestures -- " spooning," to use a time-worn expression. Very pretty,
no doubt, but not always satisfying to two parched and sun-baked
photographers watching the scorching summer day drawing to a
close, and seeing no prospect of their deserved reward.
BIRD-TALK.
By An Old Australian Bird-Lover.
The study of bird-life in freedom should be one of the subjects
taught, along with the need of bird protection, in every school. How
many pleasant moments those miss who give no thought or look
towards other things in Nature besides themselves. In the following
I give a few of my own observations. I could give more, but leave
it to other members to follow on.
Walking in the gully near my home, I came across a Honey-
sucker's nest. Originally it had contained three young of their own
species and one baby Cuckoo. Two of their young lay dead below
the nest; the other, also dead, still clung to the rim of the nest,
where it had fastened when pitched out by the Cuckoo. It is a
common sight about here during spring to see a pair of tiny Wrens
feeding a Cuckoo baby four times and more the size of themselves.
It is a strange fact that birds do know these Cuckoos abuse their
nests, yet cannot distinguish their eggs or their offspring from a
Cuckoo's. Another time my boy and myself were attracted by the
distressing calls of a Striated Wren, which actually led us towards
its nest, difficult to locate in the tall grass. We discovered by the
faintest chirping an unfeathered nestling being dragged along in a
dying condition by soldier ants. Following their trail, we found
the nest containing two young still alive but partly eaten by
these brutes. To complete the tragedy of this little family,

An Old Australian Bird-lover,
we caught the parents. The pleasure of possessing these rare
and pretty birds -- I have only seen one other pair--was short-
lived. The hen broke her leg on the way home and died ; the
cock-bird strangled himself a week later between the wires of his cage.
The Laughing Jackass, on account of its laudable reputation for
killing snakes, is a protected bird. I know the Australian bush well,
and have seen and watched hundreds of these birds, hut personally
have never seen one yet kill a snake. I noticed them swoop down,
catch up a little frilly lizard, rise up, drop it and catch it again,
probably to kill it before settling on a branch to pound the little
reptile tender. But, like the famous Butcher-birds--the worry of
my aviaries-- they steal the broods of other birds out of the nest; for
chickens they have developed a special taste. A Peewit having built
on one of the tall gum-trees in my paddock, had been watched by us
feeding its young for days--in fact, I intended to have them later
on; but a Jackass thought it had a prior right, and we noticed it
helping itself to one first under the most vociferous protestations
of the parent Peewits ; later on it fetched the other oneA Another
time, sitting under a tree, a Wood Swallow floated to the ground not
far away. Picking it up, we took it home, but it died in spite of all
our care and attention. Its trouble was being egg-bound. Even in
freedom I am sure epidemics occur amongst birds which must carry
off many a one. I picked up one of our brightly-coloured native
birds one day and brought it home, foolishly placing it in my soft-bill
aviary. This act cost me every bird I had in that flight. I could
only ascertain that the cause of death had been intestinal. A doctor
friend, to whom I showed a bird once on account of its blindness,
diagnosed it as a cataract. But there are instances brighter than
those just related. Thus I had a Borneo Partridge which chose as a

the " Magpie Lark ": it is as useful as it is handsome, for it destroys numbers

now before us recall in size and shape those of the English Missel Thrush,

thrush. -- G. R.]

friend a little Green Singing Finch. The friendship was really
grotesque. Each day I regaled my Partridge with meal-worms, and,
although it would not allow any other bird to touch them, it always
called its little friend, and, having seen it partake of one first, then
itself would eat of what was left. This bird seemed to take the lead
in that flight, and decide if a caterpillar should or should not be
eaten ; if not, it would utter a warning call, and no bird--I often
watched it--would go near it. It is strange how tastes differ even
amongst birds. We have a moth here, a veritable pest in the cater-
pillar stage, which even fowls and ducks-- I tried them--refused.
The only birds I have ever seen eating them were the Melodious
Honey-eater and the Fan-tail Cuckoo. None of my aviary birds or
another kind of native bird would touch them. We had a Sparrow
once rejoicing in the name of " Billy." One day " Billy " begun to
ail, and became weaker as the days went by. Examining it closely,
I found between the shoulders two small lumps which moved to the
touch of a pin. They proved to be maggots, conical in shape, and
quite ^ in. long. The stern really formed the lump, and when the
maggots were removed two big gaping holes showed in the skin.
" Billy" recovered, but eventually died an inglorious death by being
drowned in the soup -- mourned by the whole household. Some of
my birds like Dayals and Chinese Starlings are allowed their freedom,
and it has often puzzled me to know why these birds on summer
evenings collect big ants, put them under their wings, keep them
there for a while, and then replace them with fresh ones. The ants
used are the soldier ants, which only nip, certainly very unpleasantly
sometimes. It is hard to imagine a place without Sparrows, but
here in New South Wales the whole of the north is free from them,
simply because the railway does not run so far yet. This is a fact,
&amp;quot;that as far as the railway runs so far the Sparrow is to be found;
the next township, a few miles further, is free from them. Concluding
these notes, I will mention a little episode seen hut once, years ago
out in the west. Rising early, I saw one morning a big flock of
White Cockatoos settle not more than 300 to 400 ft. away from me
on two solitary gum-trees standing a little distance apart. Evidently
the look-out bird had not seen me, and I was able to witness a sight
to which but few white men have been treated. These birds went

Mr. Alfred North,
through a regular set of quadrille flying in fancy figures, one might
almost say, to and fro between the two trees.
In the aviaries one meets, of course, often with incidents
which make one wonder, do birds really think normally at times ?
I remember a pair of Red-collared Whydahs breeding with me. The
nest, a hanging one, similar to the Weaver nests, had such a flimsy
bottom that one could count the eggs from a distance. As I
anticipated, they slipped through one day and were broken. The
birds set to work and strengthened the bottom of the nest in such
a way that all accidents were obviated. Indeed, they raised several
broods in the same nest. At the present time I have a pair of
Peach-faced Love-birds breeding, They chose in the first instance
a box, laid, and hatched some young; then heavy rains set in,
causing the top of the box to leak. They at once arched the nest
inside the box most cunningly, but failed to rear the young. This
time they built in a hollow log, but, as the log is very exposed and
slanting, they built a sort of breakwater half-way above the nest and
entrance -- all most intelligently devised and executed. In spite of
the bleak winds and heavy rains of late, the young (three of them)
are doing well, and I hope to rear them, thanks to the ingenuity of
their parents.

The Order Passeres contains nearly all the birds noted for
their song or other musical powers, a few only of which can be
noticed here. For richness and volume of sound, the different species
of Lyre-bird must be placed first among the birds of New T South
Wales. To hear a fine old adult male Menura sujierba, or M. victories,
especially before he has left his roosting-place near the top of some
blackwood or sassafras growing in a secluded gully, pour forth his
melodious and varied natural notes to usher in the daw ? n of day, is an
experience never to be forgotten. In addition to possessing in the

males rich, organ-like and other notes, they are the finest avian
mimics in the world, imitating to perfection the notes of other birds
frequenting the same haunts, and any sound they may hear, such as
that produced by the sawing of wood or a dog barking. Within
seven miles of Sydney, Menura superha may still be found about
Middle Harbour, but on very rare occasions on the western side,
owing to the comparatively recent clearing of the undergrowth.
These birds are, however, more freely distributed the farther north
one goes, and are fairly numerous in the scrub-covered gullies and
ravines between the head of Middle Harbour and the Hawkesbury
River. Unfortunately, in the mountainous districts in the south-
eastern portion of the State, a large number of this fine species,
and also of M. victories, principally females, are destroyed every
year by the introduced fox.
The Family Laniida? is represented by the Black-backed
Crow-Shrike ( Gymnorhina tihicen) and the White-backed Crow-
Shrike (Gr. leuconota), familiarly known, both in Australia and
Tasmania, as "Magpies." They are extremely useful birds, and rid
the land of countless numbers of injurious insects and their larvae.
The White-backed and Black-backed Crow-Shrikes are also early
risers, and their flute-like carols are pleasant to the ear ; nor must

wary species, and the Collared Crow-Shrike (C. destructor), known
everyvdiere in Australia as " Butcher-birds," are more arboreal in
habits, the former frequenting chiefly the far central and western
districts of the State. The latter is more common in Eastern New
South Wales, and may be found breeding within a few miles of the
metropolis. It has a penchant for abstracting Canaries and other
small birds kept in captivity through the wires of their cages.
The Family Muscicapidae is well represented by the various
species of Flycatchers, Bush-Warblers and Robins. Of the Fly-
catchers, the Brow r n Flycatcher, or " Jacky Winter " ( Micrceca
fascinans), is the commonest resident species in Eastern New&apos; South
Wales, frequenting and breeding in the parks and public gardens
of Sydney, and the first species in early spring and summer to

welcome in with cheerful notes the dawn of clay. Around Sydney
and the suburbs the Brown Flycatcher utters its melodious notes
at the first break of dawn, and reigns supreme amongst the
numerous smaller Warblers during the early spring months.
Another familiar species about the many public reserves of the
metropolis is the Superb Warbler ( &apos;Malurus australis), the adult
male of which, in his velvety-blue and black attire and length-
ened tail-feathers partially turned over his back, may be often
seen, frequently in company Avith his modestly brown-plumagecl
consort, tripping over the grassy lawns or pouring forth his lively
tinkling notes from the top of some low shrub.A small bird, too,
that is sure to arrest one's attention at this time of the year with its
lively trilling notes is the White-throated Bush-Warbler ( Gerygone
albigularis) , locally known as the " Native Canary." The Har-
monious or Grey Shrike-Thrush ( Collyriocincla harmonica ), a tame
and familiar species about the suburbs and homesteads in the
country, too, with its clear whistling notes, must not he overlooked.
As a songster, few, if any, can vie with the Brown Singing Lark
(Cinclorhamplius cruralis). The rich, organ-like notes of the male
are usually poured forth while it mounts up high in the air, and the
song is accompanied by a tremulous motion of the wings. This
migratory species inhabits well-grassed lands, and, near the coast,
dry, open heath and stunted bracken. Another of our most pleasing
songsters is Horsfield's Bush Lark ( Mirafra horsfieldi), occurring
principally about grass-lands and cultivation paddocks. A fair
amount of its time is passed on the wing high up in the air, singing
all the while. At night at the same time of the year, among others,
also may be occasionally heard the melodious notes of the Beed
Warbler ( Acrocephalus australis), the mournful piping calls of the
Little Grass-bird ( Meg alums gramineus), and of the various species
of Cuckoos, the "Sweet-pretty-creature" note of the Black-and-white
Fantail or " Willy-Wagtail " ( Sauloprocta melaleuca), and the some-
what harsh piping cries of the Sacred Kingfisher.
* This species was figured in a characteristic attitude in the 'Avicultural
Magazine,' November, 1902.

A recent statement by Mr. Gregory Mathews, who has had
experience of both countries in an ornithological sense, on the
relative merits of the song-birds of England and Australia has
attracted a good deal of attention. It has also caused some surprise
even in Australia. Mr. Mathews declared that he preferred the
notes of the Golden-breasted Whistler (which used to be known as
the Thickhead), the Reed-Warbler, the Grey Shrike Thrush, and the
Butcher-bird to the notes of the English Thrush or Nightingale.
He added that he considered the Reed-Warbler to be " in a class by
itself." In this country we have taken it for granted that even the
best of our native songsters were not in the same class as such
famous birds as the Nightingale, the Thrush, the Blackbird, or the
Mocking-bird of America. One of the reasons for this is that in the
past very little of an authoritative character had been written con-
cerning the vocal powers of the birds of this continent. What little
was written and published had the effect of depreciating rather than
enhancing the average Australian's estimate of the singing capacity
of the birds of his native land. Adam Lindsay Gordon, for example
(who should have known enough of Australia to realise the grotesque
falsity and absurdity of his statement), gave world- wide publicity to
the notion that Australia was a country of somewhat bizarre features,
among them being "songless birds" and "scentless flowers." The
poet might have used the phrase in accordance with poetic licence,
or merely to secure a melodious and picturesque image, but the thing
was accepted as good " natural history," and is still regarded as such
in other parts of the world.
Australian people, from childhood up, had been accustomed
to reading or hearing glowing verbal accounts of the vocal wonders
of such birds as the Nightingale, the Thrush, the Linnet, and the
Mocking-bird, while at the same time having their own birds spoken
of slightingly in the manner affected by Marcus Clarke, Gordon, and
others who knew 1 little or nothing about the subject. Even now
there are people so destitute of judgment in a matter of this kind

that they deny the claims of the Australian Magpie to he considered
a song-bird at all! Yet the late John Gould, the greatest bird
student of them all, could find no words in which adequately to
describe the carol of the Magpie. " To describe the note of this
bird," he said, " is beyond the power of my pen." Professor Alfred
Eussell Wallace was equally enthusiastic, and he was a man who
devoted nine or ten years of his life to the continuous study of birds
in their native haunts in the Malay Archipelago. He described
the note as " a wonderfully modulated whistle unequalled among
European birds." Whether we regard the blithesome Magpie as a
" whistler," a caroller, or as a song-bird, there can be no mistake
about its being one of the most delightful exponents of wild melody
that is to be found among the birds of the world. If there are people
who have any doubt on this point they would do well to make an
effort to hear a group of Magpies in full song in the early hours of
a spring or an autumn morning.
The writer agrees with Mr. Mathews that the little Peed-
warbler -- which has wonderful range and versatility of song, together
with an exquisite quality of melody--is " in a class by himself; "
he also has the greatest admiration for the Golden Whistler (a bird of
superb singing powers), the Grey Thrush (which, however, pipes
rather than sings), and the clarion-throated Butcher-bird ; but he has
never heard anything in the Australian bush so fine, or so thrilling, as
a Magpie chorus about the dawn of day. It may be conceded, of
course, that in this respect the Magpies have a great advantage over
most of the other species of songsters, inasmuch as they commonly
sing in groups instead of individually. To hear the Golden Whistler
at his best one needs to visit some of the deep, heavily-timbered
valleys in the region of the Clyde Eiver, or other coastal districts,
where the birds are numerous. In such localities the early hours of
the day are made joyous to the last degree by the collective song of
the Whistlers. However, even when we have mentioned the Eeed-
warbler, the Thrush, the Whistlers, the Magpies, the Butcher-birds,
and some others, we have not nearly exhausted the list of first-rate
singing birds which are indigenous to Australia. There are the
singing Hone);-eater (Ptilotis vittata) and the Bell-bird (Oreoica
cristata), for instance. In its singing moods the Honey-eater in

*question is capricious and uncertain, but on occasions its loud note
is delightful. For sustained effort in the production of melody I do
not think that any of the bush songsters, with, perhaps, the excep-
tion of the Reed-warbler, is the equal of the Bell-bird. It is neces-
sary to point out that this songster is not identical with the so-called
Bell-bird of the coastal districts -- the Bell Minah ( Manorhina
melanopkyra). The latter is a honey-eater, whereas the crested
Bell-bii'd is an insect-eater, and belongs to the wooded regions of the
interior. As songsters there is no more comparison to he made
between the two than there is between the Silver-eye and the Reed-
warbler. Gould's collaborator, Gilbert, regarded the Bell-bird as an
accomplished ventriloquist ; and that is the impression one gets
when listening to and observing the song and the actions of the bird.
At first the notes seem to come softly and swellingly from a distance.
As the song proceeds they rise gradually, until one seems to he
right in the centre of the Hood of melody ; then one discovers that
the bird which seemed to he away off in the distance is close at hand,
in all probability sitting quite still on a dead limb or a stump. The
Bell-birds may be heard at their best in the valleys of the Murray.

Of the Order Striges, or nocturnal birds of prey, inhabiting
the State, the most common are the Delicate Owl ( Strix delicatula ),
a species very closely allied to--by some considered identical with--
the Barn Owl of Europe, and the Boobook Owl ( Ninox boobook).
One of the latter birds was captured in 1908 in the vestibule of the
Sydney Town Hall. At night-time this species often visits unpro-
tected aviaries of small birds. In the dense coastal scrubs and
brushes the rare Sooty Owl ( Strix tenebncosa ) and the large Powerful
Owl ( Ninox strenua ) are found; one of the latter birds shot at
Richmond, on the Hawkesbury River, had an " opossum " in its claws.
In the Order Steganopodes, the different genera found in the
State, as in Australia, all belong to Old World forms, the members

Mr. Alfred J. North,
of which are noted chiefly for their fish-destroying proclivities, on
which diet they almost, if they do not entirely, subsist. An instance
of the voracity of the Black Cormorant ( Plialacrocorax carbo ) may
be seen in the Australian Museum, where one of these birds is set
up as captured by a water spaniel on the Murrumbidgee River, with
a partially swallowed Murray cod ( Oligorus mctcquariensis) , weighing
over a quarter of the bird's weight, protruding from its throat.
Much damage is done to the fishing industry b}f this and allied
species, both in the inlets and large estuarine areas of the coast, as
well as on the inland rivers and lakes. The Gannet (Sula serrator )
may be seen flying some distance from the coast, dropping like a
stone, ever and anon, into the sea, in order to secure its finny prey ;
occasionally it ventures into Port Jackson. The Australian Pelican
(Pelecanus conspicillatus) frequents the islands, rocks awash, and the
sand-spits of the bays and inlets of the coast, and the large inland
lakes of the Western District, where it breeds ; it also breeds on
Cook Island, near the mouth of the Tweed River.
The Order Platalece is numerically one of the smallest in
Australia, but it contains some of its most important birds. The
Straw-necked Ibis ( Carphibis spinicollis) , the White Ibis ( Ibis
mollucca ) and the Glossy Ibis ( Plegadis fcilcinellus) occur in
thousands, and among other food, especially the former, are remark-
ably fond of locusts and grasshoppers, etc., and they do an immense
amount of good in ridding the grass-lands of the pastoralist of
myriads of injurious insects and their larvte. The Straw-necked
and the White Ibis breed in large colonies in reed-beds, cane-grass,
and low bushes in flooded country, often together, and among them
is sometimes found a solitary nest of the Royal or Black-billed
Spoonbill ( Platcdea regia), or the Yellow-legged Spoonbill ( Platibis
flavipes), the only other species of the Order occurring in New South
Wales, also in Australia, constructing their nests, like the rarer
Glossy Ibis, on the branches of trees, usually in flooded country.
Among the most important members of the Order Herodiones
in New South Wales, are the Large White Egret ( Herodias timo-
riensis) and the Plumed Egret ( Mesophoyx plumifera). Although
these birds are absolutely protected by law throughout the year, they
are much sought after in the breeding season for their beautiful

white plumes ; also for their eggs. Both of these species are more
abundantly distributed in the central and north-eastern districts.
An extremely useful bird is the White-fronted Heron ( Notophoyx
novce-hollandice), locally known in some parts of the State as the
" Blue Crane," for it destroys numbers of small land molluscs, one
of the intermediate hosts of duke. This species is sparingly dis-
tributed around the neighbourhood of Sydney, frequenting trees
growing on river banks and the sides of creeks and dams. At
intervals along the rocky coast-line occurs, usually in pairs, the
Reef Heron ( Devuegretta sacra). Birds of both sexes may have the
entire plumage of slaty-black or white, and the two forms may be
found paired together. The Minute Bittern ( Ardetta pusilla) is
distributed, but in very limited numbers, over the greater portion of
New South Wales. It is more frequently met with in the coastal
districts, than in the dry, far inland parts of the State. Near Sydney
it occurs in the swampy undergrowth from Randwick to La Perouse,
and also in the Botany Water Reserve. Towering high above every
other species in this Order, is the gigantic Black-necked Stork
(Xenorhynchus asiaticus) or"Jabiru," inhabiting the large Tea-tree
and other swamps of the northern coastal districts, its range extend-
ing to India, whence came the type originally described by Latham.
Seventeen out of the nineteen species of the Order Cheno-
morphce inhabiting Australia, are found in the State. The well-
known Black Swan ( Chenopsis atrata ) is generally distributed from
the bays, estuarine areas, particularly if the latter are overgrown
with mangroves, to the reed-beds, cane-swamps, and lakes of central
and western New South Wales. The Semipalmated or " Magpie "
Goose ( Anseranas semipalmata ) is more abundantly distributed
inland, as is also the Maned Goose (Ghenonetta jubata), better known
in New South Wales, as in other parts of Australia, as the " Wood
Duck." It is from this Order that the chief supplies of edible
Waterfowl sent to the metropolis is drawn, but only a passing refer-
ence to one or two of the more important can he made here. For
table purposes the more popularly known Black, or moi&apos;e correctly
named, Brown Duck (Anas superciliosa) takes the pride of place,
followed closely, but of smaller size, by the Chestnut-breasted Teal
(Nettion castancum) and the more common species, the Slender or

Mr. Alfred J. North,
Grey Teal (N. gibberifrons). The Pink-eared Duck ( Melacorhynchus
membranaceus ) is noteworthy for the singularity of its typical nest,
a rounded or oval-shaped structure, about a foot in diameter, of
dark slaty-grey down plucked from the breast of the parent bird.
The rarer and aptly-named Freckled Duck ( Stictonetta ncevosa ) must
not be overlooked, nor the Musk Duck ( Biziura lobata), with a
leather-like lobe depending from the centre of the under mandible,
which is much larger in the male than the female. It is a solitary
species, frequenting the inlets of the coast and the rivers and lakes
inland, and although many be found in the same bay or lake, seldom
two are seen close together. It is a poor flier, and its journeys are
always performed at night. Near Sydney it may be occasionally met
with, usually in summer, in Botany Bay, on the secluded waters of
Hen and Chickens Bay, and Lane Cove, and farther afield at
Narrabeen Lake.
The Order Columbce, besides the beauty of form and plumage
of many of its species, also contributes its share to the markets
and poulterers' shops of the metropolis, as all are edible ; but notice
can only be taken of a few of them. The Wonga Pigeon ( Leucosarcia
picata) at one time, either alive or dead, might frequently be seen
exposed for sale in the city shops. For years past, however, it has
been a forbidden delicacy, having been absolutely protected by an
enactment which remains in force till 1924. It chiefly frequents the
coastal districts and contiguous mountain ranges, and the nearest
place to Sydney where occasionally it may be met with, is at National
Park. Scarcely less sought after for sport and table purposes is the
Bronze- wing ( Phaps chalcoptera) , more plentifully distributed about
thistle-beds and acacia scrubs in central and western New South
Wales. Another toothsome species is the Partridge Bronze-wing
(Geophaps scripta ) or " Squatter," at one time a common inhabitant
of the plains of the western district, but now rarely seen, driven
away by the ever-increasing flocks of sheep and rabbits, or killed by
domestic cats run wild, and foxes, or by poisoned baits. The Harle-
quin Bronze-wing ( Histriophaps histrionica), a species chiefly
inhabiting of late years, the northern, central, and western districts,
appears now occasionally in these parts in immense flocks in an
unusually wet season following a prolonged drought. When it does

visit the State, it appears in such countless numbers as to darken
the air. It feeds to a large extent on the seeds of the Nardoo
(Marsilea quadrifolia ), growing in profusion in marshy localities.
Chiefly in the brushes of the northern coastal districts, the beau-
tifully plumaged Magnificent Fruit Pigeon (Megaloprepia magnified)
and the Little Green-winged Pigeon ( Chaleophaps chrysochlora ) are
found. Here, too, occurs the Top-knot Pigeon ( Lopliolcemus antarc-
ticus), a species much sought after by sportsmen, and better known
locally as the " Flock Pigeon," which feeds chiefly on different
species of palm seed and those of the Lilly-pilly ( Eugenia smithii).
About the neighbourhood of Sydney, which in the early days of
settlement and for a long while after was resorted to by many species
of this Order, can now only be sparingly found the Brush Bronze-
wing ( Phaps elegans), chiefly in healthy and stunted vegetation
about Middle Harbour, Manly, and Botany; and the Peaceful Dove
(Geopelia tranquilla), which, although nowhere common, has
increased of late years.
Of the Order Gallince, two of the three species of mound-
raising birds inhabiting Australia are found in the State. The
Mallee-fowl, more commonly called " Mallee-hen, frequents the
dry inland scrubs, chiefly of the central and western districts ; and
the Brush Turkey ( Catheturus lathami ) is found in the rich and
humid brushes of most of the coastal districts, although stragglers
have occurred in western central New South Wales. Both of these
species, instead of forming nests and incubating their eggs in the
usual manner of birds, scrape up large mounds of soil or gravel
debris , with which is intermingled leaves, decaying vegetable
matter and grasses, and deposit their eggs therein, which are
hatched with the heat engendered in these hot-beds. These birds
are much sought after as articles of food. In the central and
western districts, Mallee-Fowls are often destroyed by the acclima-
tised foxes, and by eating poisoned baits laid for rabbits. The
Family Phasianidce largely contributes to the satisfaction of sports-
men, also to the food supply of the metropolis, for it includes in it
the favourite Stubble Quail ( Coturnix pectoralis) and the Swamp or
" Brown " Quail ( Syncecus aicstralis). The long string of birds
known as Quail, seen hanging in the poulterers' shops of Sydney, in

Mr. J. H. Gurney,
the open season, chiefly consist of the latter species and the Varied
Turnix ( Turnix varia), or locally known "Painted" or "Dotterel
Quail," belonging to the Order Hemipodii. Mention, too, must be-
made of the Collared Plain-Wanderer ( Pedionomus torquatus), a
comparatively rare species, allied to the Turnicidce, and the only
representative of the Sub-order Pedionomi. This bird, which has.
the habit of crouching down, is not infrequently caught by dogs,
or even with the hand.

followdng report on their stomachs was drawn up by Mr. Hamond,
which may be compared with the report on those killed in April,
1910 (' Zool.,' 1911, p. 173).
Mr. F. J. Mann, of Shropham, considers that Starlings cause
him a loss of three " comb " per acre on every acre of wheat. When
the wheat is up, they get down to the young roots with their strong
beaks, and so destroy all further germination. Whether they are
seeking wireworms, or whether they are after grain, the result is the
same to the wheat, which shrivels up and perishes.

Mr. J. H. Gurney,
Spurn Head), was extraordinarily destructive to the tops of oak-trees,
which it snapped off, owing, it was supposed, to brittleness after the
prolonged drought, but the Rev. M. C. H. Bird attributed it to the
enormous crop of acorns.
October.
1st. -- The next day a Gannet came ashore alive at Lowestoft
(C. B. Ticehurst), and Mr. Ramm identified three Little Gulls at
Blakeney, as well as some Grey Phalaropes which had been carried
out of their course by the violence of the wind. A Fork-tailed Petrel
was brought to Mr. Pashley, and an Arctic Skua was picked up in
the Naval Asylum grounds at Yarmouth.
3rd.-- N.W., 2. To-day Mr. Bird reports the unusual number
of seven Land-Rails on Ruston Common ; probably this also was the
effect of the gale. Another Gannet, a young male, was picked up
at Horsey (E. Saunders), and the next day another found dying in
Lowestoft Harbour (C. B. Ticehurst). They certainly are commoner
in Norfolk than they used to be. On the 16tli I saw a young one
dead on Cromer Lighthouse hills, but it had been defunct a long
time.
6th. -- The night of October 5th was again boisterous, a strong
gale blowing from the north-east, which at seven o'clock next morning
was only three points less in its velocity than that of the week before
(September 30th). Coming as it did at the height of the migratory
season, and from the north-east, it was to be expected that it would
have an immediate effect upon birds, with the movements of which
wind is an all-important factor, as Norfolk naturalists know welL
Accordingly, the following day the head-woodman at Hempstead,
near Holt, informed me that he had seen a bird answering to the-
description of a Nutcracker. This it proved to be. The unfortunate
bird lived to get as far as Cawston, where there is a large fir-wood,
where, presumably the same individual, was shot that afternoon.
On the same day, and only about two miles from where the Nut-
cracker was first seen, a Hoopoe turned up.
9th. -- N.N.E., 4. Another Nutcracker shot at Sparham,
within five miles of where the other was shot, and it is not unlikely
that they came over together on the night of the 5th, with a third

which was shot in Buckinghamshire, as recorded. From what I
have seen of them in Switzerland, I should judge the Nutcracker to
he a bird of feeble flight, not well adapted for crossing seas, and
without a wind behind them these would hardly have got over the
North Sea. On looking back through the ' Zoologist,' I do not find
that a Nutcracker has been accorded a place in these Norfolk Notes
since 1907, and the last before that was a doubtful occurrence in
May, 1899.
12th.--About 300 Rooks seen at daybreak by Mr. F. N.
Chasen arriving at Yarmouth, cawing loudly as they dropped on the
sand-dunes. Many Rooks were to be seen during this month busy
on the recently drilled wheat-fields, in spite of all efforts to keep
them off. It is to be presumed that they are not long in finding out
which farmers have, and which have not, dressed their grain with
" corvusine." Rooks no doubt do a certain amount of good, that no
one will deny, but Mr. Walter Collinge, in his recent Report to the
Council of the Land Agents' Society (1910), lays a verdict of heavy
damages against them. In 830 dissections made by himself and
Mr. T. Thring, the percentage of grain was 67'5, and if to this be
added roots and fruit, it was 71 per cent. In Henry YIII's time
Rooks were kept in check by Act of Parliament.
13th. -- A flock of eleven Norfolk Plovers in a field of swede-
turnips at Hempstead, where the gamekeeper had noticed them for
some weeks ; also the largest congregation of Starlings on one of the
reed-ponds that I think I ever saw.
17th.--Greater Spotted Woodpecker at Hoveton. A marked
arrival of Goldcrests at Yarmouth (B. Dye), and four Brent Geese at
Cley (Pinchin).
18th.--Mr. Arthur Patterson found among the rejectamenta of
the sea some birds at high-tide mark at Caistor -- a Wood-Pigeon, a
Chaffinch, and a Robin -- and the next day, continuing his walk along
the shore, some Starlings and Thrushes. During the two preceding
days the wind had been registered at Yarmouth as due east and very
high. Probably we little know how many migratory birds succumb
to the violence of these autumnal gales. A Rook, afraid to venture
any further until compelled by hunger, remained for three days on
the "Argus" steamship.

as a golfer being twice picked up and then dropped again by a Book.
The sable bird must have been a recent and hungry arrival, which
mistook it for something edible.

Varieties of Plumage.
At the beginning of January a Wren, nearly three parts
white, but with wings normal, was found dead at Boyland, and has
since been presented to the Museum by Colonel Irby. In February
a white Chaffinch occurred at Blofield, and a pied Corn-Bunting

Having been unconsciously introduced into Norfolk from the Con-
tinent some sixteen years ago, as is supposed, the strain continues to
crop up from time to time, in spite of not being spared by shooters.
To-day one of these red birds was killed at Bylaugh, and for-
warded to Mr. T. E. Gunn. Another was seen in the spring at
Cranmer, paired with a Partridge of the ordinary colour, where,
Mr. Hamond was informed, they bred, and that the young were
normal.

28th. -- One of the so-called Sabine's Snipes, now known to be
only a melanism, was shot out of a field of turnips at Beeston, near
Cromer, by Dr. W. Sumpter, and was ascertained to be a male by
Mr. Pashley.
November 2oth. -- A nearly white Redwing shot at Framling-
ham (Roberts) ; last autumn, it will be remembered, three varieties
of this species were recorded.
Hybrid Swan x Goose.
On July 26th, through the courtesy of its owner, Mrs. N. E.
Reynolds, I had an opportunity of examining the hybrid Mute Swan,
of which I contributed an illustration last year ('Zool.,' 1911, p. 161),
and which a great many people have since been to see, as it is
thought a great curiosity. The beak and legs of this singular cross-
bred Swan are orange-yellow, and the feet large, a point noticed by
the farm-servant when she assisted in liberating it from the egg.
But the most striking feature about the bird is its long, thick neck,
which, with the head and tail, are now almost white, the back and
body only remaining blotched with slate-colour. The call of this
hybrid is said to be fairly distinct from that of its parents, but I did
not hear it. It generally lives by itself on a pond at Beeston, some-
times flying half a mile or so and returning. The Swan, which is its
father, strongly objects to having it on the same piece of water, and
this jealousy is thought by Mrs. Reynolds to mean that her hybrid is
a male.

Last winter, owing to its length and severity, w(c) all had to
deplore great mortality in wild birds, and in the spring adult birds
appear to have been unusually scarce in some parts of the country,
although I cannot say that I noticed much difference in this
neighbourhood ; still, it is likely enough that in the suburbs of any
great city birds would be able to get more shelter and food than in open
and unreclaimed land.
The question is -- need we anticipate a scarcity of birds for
some time to come in consequence of last winter's losses ? I think
not, and for several reasons. It is probable that the strongest
individuals were able to survive, and to these would be added the
examples which had been impelled to migrate southwards by the
cold, and which, by the reduced competition for nesting-sites, would
probably remain with us.
In the second place, inasmuch as cold has comparatively little
effect in reducing insect life, the scarcity of birds at the season
when many insects were waking from their winter sleep, or emerging
from the pupa, would certainly tend to make the latter unusually
abundant; many thousands which, in ordinary seasons would be
devoured, would survive to lay their eggs ; and thus an unusual
quantity of food would be provided with which insectivorous birds
could readily feed their young.
The abundance of caterpillars and white butterflies this year
has been noticed by all agriculturists and gardeners, and children
have been employed in some places to catch butterflies; but it is to
be hoped that they have been instructed only to destroy the injurious
white species, and not the beautiful insects whose caterpillars feed
on noxious weeds, grasses, wild violets, or leaves of shrubs and trees.
On the other hand, the caterpillars of many moths are perfect pests.
&amp;quot;When insect-food is scarce, either few young will be reared,
or those which are brought up will probably be delicate and short-
lived : in captivity, when sufficient insect-food cannot be provided,
the parents either throw some of their young out of the nest,
or else all perish from weakness. This year there can have been

no difficulty in obtaining abundance of food, consequently an unusual
number of young birds must have been reared, all of which should be
vigorous.
One result of this increase in insect-life has been that abnormal
numbers of apples and pears have suffered from the attacks of the
codlin-moth, and windfalls have been so numerous, that one wondered
whether any fruit would ripen on the trees ; but then, our birds this
year have hardly touched my apples (and I don't suppose I am an
exception to the rule in this respect), so that I have had as good a
crop as usual.
If our common birds have only pulled off two full nests this
year and the majority of the young are plump and vigorous, I think
last winter's losses will be fully made up ; but I am rather afraid
that boys who have been encouraged this year to search for and
destroy sparrows' eggs, may have exceeded their instructions, and
taken toll of the eggs of other species.
Of course, in the case of migratory species the number should
be greater than usual; since they not only would not have suffered
from the severity of the winter, but would certainly benefit by the
excessive quantity of, insect-food. Partly migratory birds which
have suffered have probably been replaced by immigrants which in
ordinary years might have wandered farther before settling down.
Early in the year I noticed an unusual number of young
birds in my garden, and this state of things continued right through
the summer, so that cats in this neighbourhood have had a particu-
larly good time. (Why is there no tax on these predaceous creatures ?)
Although I suppose linnets only feed their young, in the earlier
stages of their growth, on green fly and very small caterpillars, I
never remember to have heard so many about as during the past few
w r eeks.
If we only experienced mild winters in this country, both
sickly and strong individuals would doubtless survive to propagate
their species ; and the chances are that our birds would deteriorate
in vigour ; so that, sad as it is to realise that thousands have perished
through cold and hunger, it may be of ultimate service in retaining
the constitutional vigour of later generations; anyhow it is better to
be optimistic and hope that such is the case.

Mr. W. G. Pekcival writes from " Nanza," Chania Bridge, B.E.A.: I will
try and send some notes, but I am no good at articles. But firstly let me say that,
though keen on birds, I am woefully and wonderfully ignorant about them. It is
only during the last year that I have taken them up again. So far I have only had
one Cossypha ( C . heuglini) yellow breast with black and white eye-stripe--sounds
rather like the one you ask about. I had it for a couple of months, and then let it
go one day as it was a bit seedy. Don't think we get Peters' Spotted Fire-finch
just here. The Crimson-ringed, Jackson&apos;s, and Pintail Whydahs are, of course,
common, also Brown-shouldered Whydah. I had some Chestnut-breasted Star-
lings, but let them go. At present my birds consist of the four above-mentioned
Whydahs, Coral-billed Weaver, and Pyromelana xanthomelana, two Thrushes
(T. elgoncnsis), one Rock Thrush, Serins -- striolatus and angolensis, a couple of
Starlings, and some common Waxbills.
I had a lot of Sunbirds, but as I could not give them the attention they
need I released them. I had: N. kilimensis -- all blue, long tail; Ginnyris acik
cequatoralis -- Ruby-throated ; C. kirki -- blue back, green crown and crimson
breast; C. falkensteini -- Yellow-bellied Sunbird ; N. formosa --Malachite Sunbird.
I hoped to get the other species but gave it up for above reason. Unfortunately
I am not permanently here, so that if I did get a good collection of birds, I should
have to let them go if I went away.
I met in Nairobi recently Major Appleby -- Postal Service--from India, a
member of the Avicultural Society, probably known to you. He has brought his
traps, nets, etc., from India: he came out here for a few days and we did a little
trapping together. I gave him a few of my birds, as he is sending one of his men
back to India soon with some.
ENGLISH v. GERMAN DEALERS.
Mr. H. E. Rogers writes: There cannot be a fair comparison between an
English dealer packing for a four or six hours' journey and a German dealer
packing for a sea and land journey of considerable duration. Investigation upon
these lines would prove that at least there is not more mortality amongst British
exports or imports than corresponding German exports or imports.
It does not become me to criticise the methods of another dealer, though
that dealer is a German; but in some thirty years' experience I can assure you,
and can prove it by figures, that in many cases the German dealer has been
able to artificially raise prices, monopolise, and maintain those prices, as a direct
result of the preference shown by British purchasers, and, at least in the cases
I have in mind, he can well afford any extra expense he may be put to.
Many years ago the late William Cross introduced Hungarian partridges
and pheasants into England. There was for a year or two considerable loss,
but eventually the business was so organised as to become interesting and very
profitable, the losses by mortality being less than 1 per cent. What happened?
The German or Hungarian came to London, formed a combine of the catchers
and dealers in his own country, monopolised, and put up prices in England.
This business he conducted without even paying any rent, rates, taxes, or

met in London, re-labelled at the station, and re-consigned. However, this is one

A VISIT TO THE ZOO EIGHTY YEARS AGO.
In view of Dr. Hopkinson's paper on this subject in the October number
the Magazine, the following facts may be of interest:
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.995237666666667" page_id="32704387"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
(1) The article in the ' Quarterly Review ' was written by W. J. Broderip,
a barrister, and in later years the author of two books, ' Zoological Recreations '
and ' Leaves from the Note-book of a Naturalist.' He collaborated with Mr.
N. A. Vigors in drawing up the first ' Guide to the Gardens,' published in 1829.
(2) The first parrot house was built in 1834, in what is now the South
Garden. It was lighted from above only and had outside cages. By the autumn of
1855 it had become a small mammal house, and many will remember it, with its
cages running all round the inside, its table-cases for mice and gerbils, and the doors
at either end. A photograph of this building will be found on p. 103 of Mr. Aflalo's
book, 'A Walk through the Zoological Gardens.' It was pulled down to make room
for the more modern house for small mammals, which was opened in 1904.
(3) The aviary fronting the lawn was not the present Eastern Aviary, though
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.6059774" page_id="32704387"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
occupying practically the same site. The Crowned Cranes which it contained
were probably those presented to the Society by William IV. in 1830, being portion
of the Royal Menagerie in Windsor Park. The present Eastern Aviary was not
built till 1862. It was larger than its predecessor, better lighted and ventilated,
and had a novel feature in its elevated floor.
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.991988333333333" page_id="32704387"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
(1) The aviary for "small and middle-sized birds" still survives near the
tunnel. In later years it has served as a Civet House, a Parrakeet Aviary, and
a Crow Aviary. It originally contained a collection of British birds and also some
foreigners -- i.e. a Crested Partridge, Chinese Starling, Parrot Fruit Pigeon, and
American Sparrow-hawk.
(5) The Eagles' Aviary was an octagonal building with a pointed roof,
situated near the site of the present bandstand. It contained in 1829 a Griffon
Sociable Vultures, a White-headed Eagle, White-tailed Eagle, Osprey, and some
Golden Eagles. A writer in the 'Quarterly Review' for December. 1855, notes
that the Eagle's Aviary had been pulled down, and its site laid with grass and
added to the lawn.
(6) The "learned and experienced medical attendant" of the Zoo was
</listItem>
<reference confidence="0.812613444444444">
Prof. William Youatt, who retired from his duties in 1845. He contributed a
volume on the horse to the ' Library of Useful Knowledge,' and also wrote a
book on the dog, which passed through at least two editions.
(7) The Lion House consisted of a row of nine dens on the lawn in front
of what is now the Camel House.
(S) The Monkey House was approximately on the site of the present
Jackals' Enclosure.
(9) The Chimpanzee lived in the keeper's quarters, and not in the " Ape-
Ant-eater and Hot-water House," which was not completed until 1S52.

The Editor of the ' Avicultural Magazine.'
Dear Sir, -- For some time it has been our privilege to obtain, through a
library, back numbers of your magazine. We have been so impressed with the
excellence of the reading matter and of the illustrations that we have come to feel
quite a personal interest in its welfare.
We decided that perhaps you would not consider it too great a liberty if we
forwarded a few notes on one of our birds which is, at any rate, known in England-
Of course, we are not members, although one of us, being interested in aviculture,
may shortly apply to become one.
As an explanation of the many defects you will notice in this attempt, we
must point out that we have, as yet, the disadvantages of youth, inexperience, and
a cheap photographic apparatus. Our desire to forward some little contribution
was prompted partly by our interest in the Magazine, and partly by a certain amount
of pride in our native birds.
With best wishes for the continued success of your good work,
Department of Labour, We remain, yours sincerely,
Melbourne, Victoria, S. A. Lawrence and
Australia. R. T. Littlejohns.

accompanied this letter, and hope to have more from our Australian friends.-- G. R.]

Dear Sir, -- Many individuals (our excellent late Editor among them) seem
to think that the cold which kills birds is equally destructive to insects, whereas
the latter retain their lives in a dormant condition even when their bodies are
frozen hard and their limbs temporarily are as brittle as spun glass.
Many insects hibernate in hollow trees, under eaves, in barns or outhouses,
church towers or any old buildings, with no artificial heat whatever; others burrow
just below the surface of the earth, where they are drenched with rain and frozen
into the soil, yet with a little heat, either natural or artificial, they thaw out and
become active. Believe me,

A VALUABLE SUGGESTION.
Dear Dr. Renshaw,--I have written you a short article (it will print into
about four or five pages) on the " Development of Patterns in Birds." The fact is,
I want to stir up some of our members to produce hybrids between birds not very
closely related. The cross between the Zebra- and Diamond-Finches threw a lot of
light upon the manner in which markings were evolved, and indicated relationships
which can only have merged at a very remote period. I suspect that you have
plenty of copy at present. Yours very sincerely,

Sir, --I was very interested in Mr. Shore-Baily&apos;s article, " Some Kails and
Gallinules." Some years ago I had the Purple and Grey-headed Gallinules, also
another which I have not been able to name. It was all bine, no green on saddle,
and the head was an intense blue, about the size of the Purple Gallinule. If any
member can give me the name I shall be very much obliged. I had it set up when
it died, and I gave it to the Leeds Museum, and it is there now unnamed.

[This species is Porphyrio caruleus -- the true Purple Gallinule, as originally
named by Latham. It inhabits the countries bordering the Mediterranean and
has doubtless often been confused with the Violet Gallinule ( Porphyrio porphyrio),
which inhabits Africa further south. The two species are very closely allied, and as
their range is probably coterminous, they would be likely subjects for experiments
in hybridising birds, as advocated by Dr. Butler.-- G. B.]

Dear Dr. Benshaw, -- My Bed-collared Lorikeets are too new for me to be
able to write an article on them. I have mated my cock with one of the hens, and
they go into a nesting-box for most of the day, but I don't know if there are eggs.
I took the other hen out and wish to sell her. They are very fearless, inquisitive
birds, and fly to me at once for treacle and water; and when I set a mouse-tran
they were almost interested-- so much so that I was afraid they would get hurt,
and had to take it out.
I waited a little to see if their nesting were serious, and I looked yesterday,
but there are no eggs, though they both stay in the box nearly all day. The cock
went into the box the moment I put it up again, and I was afraid he was going to
attack me when I first took it down.
I saw a very beautiful Cockatoo at Cross's some weeks ago--white, with a
faint blush of pink about the cheeks, and pale sulphur on crest and under the
wings, and only about the size of a Bosella. Such a dainty little bird.*

Dear Dr. Botler,-- My little cock Zebra-Finch has a bad foot; he had it
when he came (from Cross), and it gets no better. He has lost the two side-toes
almost entirely, and the disease seems to be in the main joint now. He looks in
perfect health, and it does not seem to be very painful, though he preens it fre-
quently. Can anything be done ? I soaked it in warm water and then oiled it with
camphorated oil once, but catching him disturbs the pair so very much. The perches
are always clean.
My Bed-naped Lorikeets spend most of their time (both) in a nesting-box,
but I have not looked in. I think of selling the odd hen; I separated her, and it's
a bother attending her. Yours sincerely,

The best remedy is to soak the foot in warm water until quite clean and then
dip into a sulphate of zinc solution (5 gr. to an ounce of water), and this should
be done twice daily until the cure is complete.

THE EVOLUTION OF FEATHER-PATTERNS.
Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- Herewith I enclose article, and hope it will prove
satisfactory.
My idea is that originally a bird's plumage was simply ornamented with
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.9928696" page_id="32704390"  page_num="108" year="" vol="">
shaft-streaks more simple in pattern than in the Greenland lalcoiq, possibly, at
an earlier stage, even these did not exist.
That the development started froi a simple fusiform streak to the hastate
type i , then to the sagittate A , next to , this form which subsequently
gave rise to submarginal or marginal borders, the shaf ;treak sometimes persisting,
but frequently disappearing by absorption.
However, you will see what I say about en colour is growing in the
breast and throat feathers of the Grey Cardins s, tarts at the shaft,
and so daily extends until the buffish feathers have become entirely crimson (or
black). I watched similar growth of coiour in Pyromelana when assuming the
summer plumage (the greater part of the plumage is not moulted out in the spring,
whatever some excellent ornithologists may believe. In the first volume of the ' Emu,'
p. 71, E. M. Cornwall mentions the case of a Galah Cockatoo which injured its wings
when flapping, am&lt;' the whole of one side of his plumage became darker and the pink
of the injured side became dark red." He remarks : "The vane of a feather is usually
regarded as physiologically dead, but this occurrence, though an exceptional one,
seems to strengthen the argument of those who contend that it is possible for
colouring matter to pass from the basal gland throughout the whole structure."
That this is so is evident in the case of Turacus, in which the scarlet colouring in
the wings is soluble in water, gets washed out in heavy r-ains, but is gradually
recovered when dry weather supervenes.
A very common type of pattern in birds is one in which the head, breast,
collar, rump, and sometimes vent are each sharply defined in colour: then you have
combinations of two or more of these characters, but the general design is far less
varied than is the case with lepidopterous insects; but of course the beauty of
many birds is much enhanced by secondary sexual characters.
These matters interest me far more than classification. I suppose the
interesting conversations which I used to have in my youthful days with Darwin,
Bates, Trimen, and others roused a spirit of questioning the cause of things in my
mind, and it still sticks to me even now at the age of 78. Will it continue to the
end if I attain to my father's age, 97? Believe me,

On Lake Klamath we saw many thousands of the great white
Pelicans, flying, swimming, and nesting. They have a stately
dignity, and, when slowly moving over the waters of this beautiful
mountain lake, remind one of one of our American battleships in
their gleaming, snowy white. When flying the tips of their wings
are black, and they tuck their heavy bald-looking heads down between
their shoulders.Ex-President Roosevelt, when he was in office,
passed a law protecting them, and a heavy fine is imposed on
anyone killing them.
I am told they live on chub, but have seen them snatch and
eat many a good-sized trout. However, as these latter are most
numerous in the lake, they can well be spared to feed these wonderful
birds.
They nest on a small island at the lower end of the lake, where
hot springs keep the water around them quite warm all the year
round.
I know very little of their habits, or whether they migrate or
not, though in the autumn and winter I have seen a few on the
Bay of Monterey, in California; so I presume they go south in the

winter time, when Lake Klamath is mostly frozen and the surrounding
mountains are covered with snow. The elevation of 4000 feet means
naturally cold weather in winter, and Northern Oregon is also much
colder than Central and Southern California, especially on the sea
coast.
All kinds of Duck, Geese, Swans, etc., are plentiful to abun-
dance. October 1st opens the Pheasant hunting here for two weeks
only. The Chinese Pheasant is the only variety open to sportsmen
to shoot; the other varieties being still protected by close season
until they are more abundant.
Great numbers of Duck are now on the Bogue Biver, and
the season for them also and for Quail opens October 1st. Salmon
and Steelhead are running up the Bogue and spawning in the shallow
reaches. I have noticed Herons, Terns, Loons, and many other
wildfowl hunting the salmon eggs in the shallow places, and many of
them eat the fish that have died after spawning.
Steelhead are the gamest fish for the lover of rod and reel,
better even than the salmon. I have seen a twelve-pounder grab
the fly and go straight down stream with a hundred yards of good
Hardy line, and the fisherman dive in and swim too, until he could
get a check and a chance to reel in a little.
Pishing of this kind is no easy sport; but again, I diverge
from birdlore, for which, pray pardon me !
[' Bird Lore,' vol. svii, No. 6, contains a most interesting
paper on bird life in the Klamath district. According to the writer,
Mr. W. L. Binley, the lake is about twelve miles long and some
five or six miles broad. It is encumbered by islands of floating
vegetation, which give asylum to great colonies of Pelicans, Gulls,
Cormorants, and other birds. Mr. Pinley's party found the Pelicans
sitting in rows of hundreds, their chins solemnly resting on their
chests-- like a huge congregation. Bed-head, Pintail, Canvas-back,
and Cinnamon Duck were seen, also Great Blue Heron, Coots,
and Avocets. The lake is constantly policed by an Audobon patrol
boat, as the Pelicans were formerly ruthlessly destroyed for millinery
purposes.-- G. B.]

By M. Pierre Amedee Pichot.
A few years before the war, several species of American Quails
or Partridges, as they are called, though different from the European
birds, were being newly imported by our bird-dealers, particularly at
Bordeaux. Having been one of the first breeders of the Californian
Partridge ( Lophortyx ) when it was introduced into France, I was
very much interested in the new species, and determined to try my
hand at them. In 1896 one M. Deschamps, on his return from the
United States, had brought with him and sold to Gerard, a large
importer of animals, whose firm was situated in the suburbs of
Paris, a lot of six males and five females (Californians) for the round
sum of #112, and from the young bred by Gerard I got my first birds.
Fortunately the new species did not fetch such a high price, and I
secured, for a moderate sum (#2 or #3), the Cuban and Texan Bob
Whites ( Colinus ), the Scaled Partridge (Callipepla squamata), and
the Montezuma, or, as we call them, Massena Quails ( Gyrtonyx ).
These last are the most arresting to the eye on account of the
very singular white and black stripes of their cheeks, which put you
in mind of the fantastic colour patches with which the circus clowns
bedaub their faces. Yet the Massena Quail is far from having the
elegant demeanour of its close cousins. Tucking its head in its
shoulders, it looks as if it were hunch-backed, and the tail coverts
falling over the rump make a ball of its body, giving it the outline
of an Emu. The breast and flanks are of a rich velvety black,
sprinkled with round white dots like those of the Guinea-fowl. The
crown of the head is covered by a rather thick crest of elongated
feathers, falling backwards on the occiput in the style of a chignon.
" From its gentle disposition and unwillingness to move," says
Elliot (' Game Birds of North America'), "this bird has gained the
sobriquet of ' fool quail,' and in its wild state has often been killed
with a stick in the hands of its pursuer."
I found the Massenas very tame indeed, and started with
great expectations, but was very unlucky at first. Bird after bird
died ; now the male, then the female, just as I hoped to have fixed
upon a paired couple. They had been located in a large aviary, and

M. Pierre Amedee Pichot,
were rather shy, hiding in a bunch under the litter of hay in the
covered flight. When going into the open compartment, they were
all the time most busy scratching the grass, as if they were searching
for some food they were missing. The fact is, the nails of their toes
and their strong arched bills are no doubt adapted to digging habits,
as is the case with the Impeyan or Monaul Pheasant, and they scoop
out a carrot or cabbage-stalk quite cleverly. I suspect they feed a
great deal on some kind of root or tuber in their own country.
Elliot says, indeed, that in certain localities their chief food seems to
be small bulbous roots ; but, as he does not specify of what kind, I
was at a loss what to supply them with.
The last time I went to pick up a dead male Massena in the
aviary, I discovered that the female had made a rough kind of nest
in a wooden box on the ground, and laid four glossy white eggs, but
she herself died a few days later, having gone quite distracted from the
loss of her spouse, running about to find him, and calling him all day
long with a drawling, melancholy whistle, so much like the moanings
of a mourner ! So I put the eggs under a bantam, and, after twenty,
five days of incubation, I had the pleasure to see three chicks breaking
their shells all at the same time. The fourth egg was addled.
The wee chicks were hardly bigger than a Cockchafer!
They proved very active at once, and were fed with the same food as
Californians. But, alas ! their step-mother was rather too clumsy
for such little things, and she crushed one of them in the narrow
breeding-box in which they were being brought up. So I let the
covey loose on a lawn, where they did very well until a neighbour's
cat carried one off. I had to put back the last remaining youngster
with its nurse into a covered aviary, in which the poor orphan
fretted a good deal, trying to find an exit, as he had acquired a taste
for roaming at large. He was two months old when a very damp
and chilly autumn set in, and I found my poor bird dead one morning.
He was a most lovely and affectionate little pet, following me in
the garden like a dog when I took him out for a walk, and keeping
so close to my feet that I had to be very careful not to tread upon
him. He fed from the hand, and was never so pleased as when I took
him up, and then he would nestle in the palm of my hand enjoying
the warmth and chirping contentment.

Thus ended my experience with the first Massena Quails born
in France, and now I cannot hope to get any others before the end
of the war, when we shall be allowed to return to our peaceful
hobbies.
The Texan and Cuban Bob Whites did not breed with me,
neither did the Scaled or Blue Partridge, but my colleague of the
Acclimatisation Society, Delacour, brought up a covey of the last, as
*did also M. Biquet at Montpellier. These have also been reared by a
member of the Avicultural Society of England, Mr. Shore Baily, who
obtained a cross with a Californian male, and he kindly presented a
couple of the hybrids to our Acclimatisation Society. They were
both males, and one is still living.
I imagine that some of the thirty-two species described and
figured by Gould in his splendid folio on the Oclontopliorince, are very
closely related, perhaps only local varieties, blending out into one
another, if not hybrids. Most have, anyhow, very distinct and
dissimilar call-notes, and their top-knots are so fanciful and various as
to prove their very good taste in the way of natural selection, if
natural selection had anything to do with the formation of their
species. Indeed, no milliner's shop could with a greater diversity of
elegant hats court the approbation of the fashionable world.
Several of the so-called American Quails or Partridges have at
times found their way to Europe. I have seen at our Acclimatisation
Gardens in the Bois de Boulogne the splendid Plumed Partridge
( Oreortyx) with its two long crest feathers streaming over its back.
The London Zoo has bred Scaled and Douglas Quails. The Cali-
fornian has been turned out in France and bred wild, but dis-
appeared. The Virginian Boh White has been tried also with better
success, since Macgillivray and Harting have included it in their list
of British birds, and I have known a place in Brittany where they
did well for a time. Harting, in his ' Handbook,' has mentioned
many attempts to acclimatise them in England during the course of
the last century, but they seem all to have failed after a few years of
breeding at large. The Californians alone have stood their ground,
being very prolific, but only as inmates of aviaries, where they are
now quite common.

THE BREEDING OF THE MEXICAN BLACK-
BREASTED QUAIL (C. pectoratis).

<bodyText confidence="0.9991124375" page_id="32704404"  page_num="114" year="" vol="">
As not very much has appeared in the Magazine of recent
years with regard to any of the Quail family, I thought that the
following account of the breeding of the Mexican Black-breasted
Quail in my aviaries this season would be of interest. I purchased
two pairs of these handsome birds from Focklemann in 1913, and on
their arrival found them to very closely resemble their North American
cousin, the popular " Bob White " (C. virginianus). The male differs
in having a larger area of the breast black; to an ordinary observer
the hens are indistinguishable. The same remark applies to the
other females in the group, which, according to Ridgway, consists of
nine species. I haven't the least doubt but that any of these would
interbreed, and that fertile hybrids would result. I hope next year
to try one of my young ones with a Cuban cock (C. cubanensis). For
the first three years that I had them they were kept in rather small
aviaries, and although several nests were built no eggs were laid.
Last year I turned a pair into a large grass aviary. Towards the end
of July the hen disappeared, and I concluded that she was incubating.
Our hunt for the nest proved unsuccessful, and as she had not shown
up by the end of August I naturally thought that she must have
died, which subsequently was proved to be the case. The first week
in September the cock also vanished. This would be quite six weeks
after the hen had last been seen, and thinking that he also was dead
my interest in Quails was reduced to a minimum. However, on
entering the aviary one morning some three weeks later, I was
astonished to see him sunning himself on a heap of brushwood. In
the evening he was again missing, which pointed to the fact that he
was sitting somewhere upon a clutch of eggs. The next morning I
and my aviaryman had a thorough search for the nest, and just as
we were giving it up in despair the bird got up at our feet from a
nest containing eight eggs. I thought at the time that this was a
very singular occurrence, for, although I had known Californian and
Squamata males to take charge of their young ones, I had never

known them to take over the incubation part of the business as well.
This year I provided the cock with another mate, as I thought that
he deserved one. Toward the end of June I missed her and guessed
that she was sitting, but as the grass and undergrowth this year was
particularly long I thought it useless to hunt for the nest. How-
ever, on the 26th of the month, whilst looking for a Jackson's
Whydah's nest, I nearly put my foot on it. The cock fluttered off,
acting as if its wing were broken, and I really thought at first that I
must have injured him, but after he had lured me a few yards from
the nest he winged his way to the far end of the aviary. The nest
was neatly built of dead grass and roots and was very well hidden.
It contained ten white eggs, some of which were slightly stained
with pale grey and buff. Strange to say the nest was within 3 ft.
of that of the Jackson's Whydah. I may here remark that the latter
bird's nest, instead of being on the ground, as was the case last year,
was suspended from the growing grass more than a foot above it.
Possibly the wet season had something to do with this. On examining
the Quail's nest again in the evening, I found that the cock had again
returned to it. From this time he sat night and day until July 19th,
only leaving the nest occasionally in the evening to feed. At such
times the eggs were left quite uncovered, sometimes for an hour or
more. On the 20th a little Quail's head could be seen peeping out
from under the cock's wings, and the next day he led away six little
ones. All this time the hen had been invisible, but I thought that
now her little ones were hatched she would take some interest in her
domestic duties again ; but no, she would have nothing to do with
them, and the fact that any of them were reared is entirely due to
the wonderful care of the good old father. The young ones were a
good deal darker when first born than Californians of the same age,
in this respect resembling the young of the White-cheeked Crested
Quail ( Eupsychortyx ). About this time I was away on holiday, so
didn't see anything of them for two or three weeks, but my man told
me that they kept to the thick cover and were rarely visible. The
first that I saw of them was when they were about a month old.
They were then the colour of baby Partridges, and were in charge of
the cock as usual. At two months' old there were three survivors.
These very closely resembled their mother. They were extremely

Mr. Maurice Amsler,
shy and took cover just like Partridges, relying for protection upon
their neutral colouring, which makes them almost impossible to see
when upon the bare ground. On more than one occasion I have
flushed them at my feet, when they have risen with a whirring noise,
almost equal to that made by a small covey of Partridges. No
artificial food whatever was provided for them, and they had to
subsist upon what seeds fell from the small birds' feeding tables and
upon what food they could forage for themselves. Fortunately, there
were plenty of ants' nests in the long grass, and the eggs they scraped
out formed, I think, their principal diet in their early days. They
now visit the feeding tables with their father. On September 17th I
first noticed one of the young Quail showing black on the breast, ten
days later he had acquired his white face-marks, and at the time of
writing, October 4th, he is practically in full colour. The other two
birds are hens.

THE YUCATAN JAY (Xanthura yuca.ta.nka .) :
AN AVICULTURAL FAILURE,

virtuous enough to record them ! An account of these failures might
enable some other bird-lover to succeed where we had failed, and
this is the very reason why we remain " mum " for two or three
seasons; then the birds die, and are perhaps impossible to replace,
and much valuable experience remains locked up in our note-books,
and is finally forgotten. In this particular instance I claim no
credit, as the birds in question are shortly leaving me, and I feel
quite sure I shall never be able to afford another pair. They are a
pair of Yucatan Blue and Black Jays, to which I referred in a
previous note, and were on deposit at the Zoo last spring, where
many of our members must have seen them. I, amongst others,
admired and watched them, and came to the conclusion that they
were a true pair ; whereupon I persuaded their owner, Mr. Guy
Falkner, to lend them to me for the breeding season ; this he very
kindly did.

In a note written at the time Mr. Falkner, in describing the
birds and their feeding, told me that the tamer of the two birds was
the hen. When they arrived here I was inclined to agree with him,
but I also suspected that the other bird was likewise a hen. We
both proved to be wrong, as subsequent history will show.
Before entering in meclias res I should again like to question
the wisdom of calling these birds Jays ; they have the general outline
of a Magpie, they have no crest, and their general behaviour and
cries, both of pleasure and alarm, are identical with those of my
Blue Pies which bred here in 1915.
In size this species is a little inferior to our Common Magpie.
The colour distribution is fairly easily described, being blue on the
back, upper surface of wings and tail; the shade of blue is a mixture
of saxe-blue and verditer, according to the light in which it is viewed.
The hill, head, neck, and under parts are black ; the legs primrose-
yellow. I am told that when these birds arrived they were in their
nestling plumage, and that their heads were white. The above
remark applies to some young birds imported by the late Major
Horsbrugh. Mr. Frostick, on the other hand, has also imported a
bird of this species--the hen of my pair--and he tells me that the
head in this case was not white, hut that the bill was yellow and
only turned black after the moult.
The birds came to me in March of this year, and were housed
in a large cage in a cold room for the first month. During this time
they played at nest-building, but their efforts never went further
than carrying a twig about and trying to wedge it into the wires of
the cage front. A good many " scraps " went on from time to time
and the tamer bird (the supposed hen) frequently took food from my
hand and gave it to the cock, who after a few&apos; minutes would return
the food to the "hen," who accepted the tit-bit with much squeaking
and flapping of wings.
In the middle of April the birds were turned out into a narrow
aviary 18 ft. long and about 3 ft. deep, at one end of which there is a
rather dark and very secluded shelter. Stick-carrying went on for
the next few weeks, two nesting sites being chosen--one in a standard
bay-tree; the other in a wooden box in the shelter. Nothing
approaching a nest was built, but I believe that the attempt in the

Mr. Maurice Amsler,
bay-tree was intended to distract my attention from the actual
nesting site finally chosen. I understand that our Magpie amongst
others sometimes builds several nests, hut, of course, only occupies
one.
On June 1st I had an eye-opener, the supposed cock was
sitting in the nest box, and later in the day I was able to inspect the
box and found one egg laid on the bare board; I did this at the risk
of my personal beauty, and especially of my eyes ; both birds were
furious, but I was justified in my action by what I found. Naturally
it was necessary to provide a nest for the eggs.
On June 2nd the second egg had been laid (on each occasion
between 10-11 a.m.), and I sallied forth in search of a Thrush's nest.
Of course, for a long time I found nothing but nests with eggs or young,
or else structures that were so weather-beaten that they fell to pieces,
when touched. Finally, having found what I wanted, I returned
home in fear and trembling. I had first to face the infuriated birds,
and secondly, to run the risk of making them desert altogether. It
was necessary to lift the hen off her eggs before I could get to work,
and I did this with my eyes shut, as the male was all over me ; the
noise, moreover, was deafening, and I feared an immediate visit from
a neighbour or a E.S.P.C.A. inspector. The box containing the eggs
and about to receive the nest was unfortunately oblong instead of
square. My nest filled the breadth of the box perfectly, but there
was naturally a hollow space left at the end of the box, and although
I filled up the void fairly well with straw and made everything secure
as I thought, future events proved that I was wrong.
Shortly after my departure the hen returned to her eggs, and
that night laid her third egg and started sitting in earnest ; on
June 4th the last egg was deposited. Up to the present you will
remember I was still uncertain whether I had a true pair or not, the
exchange of food from one to another and back again had been con-
tinuing, but it did not help one in differentiating the sexes and was
unlike the behaviour of any birds I had ever owned or seen.
I hoped I had a true pair, but still feared both were hens ;
however, my fears were soon put to rest. Shortly after the hen began
her incubation I observed the cock collect some fifteen or twenty
meal-worms which he swallowed and pouched for some minutes ; he

then flew to the nest, quickly fed the sitting-hen, and left her imme-
diately--there was no longer the return of food which I have
described.
Later in the day any remaining doubt was dispelled by the
cock covering the eggs the moment the hen left the nest.
The cock's behaviour on the nest would have been amusing if
it had not ended in disaster. Even when unaware that he was being
watched he was in a continuous state of fidgets -- obviously painfully
bored by his duties -- yawning, gaping, fidgeting, and turning round
and round sometimes, especially if watched; and with the object of
deceiving one as to his occupation, he would preen himself violently
or peck at the edge of the box holding his nest, until I sometimes
feared he would tackle the nest itself. I was always relieved when I
knew the hen was sitting again.
The Occipital Blue Pie incubates for sixteen days, and using
this figure for my calculation, I expected the Blue and Black
Pies to hatch on June 19th.
On the morning of this eventful day I was out early, and
approaching the aviary quietly was surprised to see both birds off
the nest. Although I approached very quietly, they both saw me
instantly; instead of coming to the wires as he usually did, the cock
remained sitting close to the hen. Both birds might have been
stuffed specimens, perfectly motionless, not even the flicker of an
eyelid, with a glassy, steady stare in my direction which still further
suggested the taxidermist. I was prepared to sit through the
performance, but at the end of fully five minutes I began to get
tired, and in truth to feel a little uncanny, so I approached the birds ;
the result was an immediate transformation scene -- pandemonium
from both birds and a rush to the nest by the cock--but not before I
had caught a glimpse of the four eggs.
To this day I have not guessed why the birds behaved thus
but I suspect that the hatching of at least one chick was imminent,
and that they were particularly anxious in consequence that my
suspicions should not be aroused.
On the evening of that day both birds were certainly feeding
young ; all food was collected by the cock, who shared it with the
hen on the nest. She then raised herself slightly in order to let the

Mr. Maurice Amsler,
male disgorge the remainder of his food to one of the young, after
which she did likewise, and immediately settled down again.
Any approach on my part was much resented by the cock,
who at once interposed himself between me and the nest and made
ugly faces at me ; if he was using bad language, which I strongly
suspect, it was done entirely sotto voce.
Up to June 22nd I never saw the hen off her young, and it
was not until the 27th that I was able to get a glimpse of the chicks.
There were two, about the size of a plucked Sparrow ; the hen from
now on occasionally left the nest, but always perched hard by, and
the arrival of the cock with food was a signal for her to return to her
family; the male did most of the feeding, the hen contenting herself
with picking up bits of food spilt on the edge of the nest, these she
either swallowed herself or gave to the young.
On July 1st, at the age of twelve days, the chicks were about
the size of a Thrush, light grey in colour, bills pinkish, quills on
head, back and wings dark grey. During my examination I noticed
the cock squatting in a wire basket at the other end of the shelter,
evidently with the intention of making me think his family was really
there and not in the nest I was inspecting.
Just about this time he began to have a mania for spring-
cleaning or some such nefarious habit; the nest was continually
being tidied, and finally my precious lump of straw, which was
keeping the nest in its place, was ruthlessly pulled out, with the
result that one edge of the nest which was now unsupported began
to be pressed down. I did not know it at the time, hut was soon to
find it out.
On July 5th the chicks had grown considerably since my last
visit; their heads were bristling with greyish-white quills, the eyes
were open -- blue-grey feathers showing at the tips of the wing-
quills&apos;.
July 6th : One chick found cold and stiff ; it had crept out of
the nest to the other end of the box and had consequently not been
brooded during the night. This is the bird of which a photo accom-
panies this article, age eighteen days.
On the following day both birds were very loath to feed the
remaining youngster. In the afternoon I found him on the ground

Contrary to popular belief, the bodies of birds are not, as a rule, uniformly feathered. In this
beautiful photograph the pterylosis, or arrangement of the feather-tracts, is well shown. We
readily distinguish, for example, a median ventral feather-tract, with a bare space or apterion
to either side. The pollex or thumb is recognisable tipped with its feather; then come the
primary, followed by the secondary, quids. On the shoulders are seen the scapular feather-
tracts, and there is a whorl of feathers about the external ear. -- G. R.

and replaced him in the nest. The cock fed him once, I think ; at
10 p.m. I approached the aviary and flashed a pocket torch on the
scene. Both parents were, as I expected, sitting on their old
sleeping-perch right away from the nest, and the chick was being
allowed to die of cold and starvation. I took him in and stuffed him
with a small quantity of food, but he was very weak and refused to
gape. At the end of two days he had improved a little and I handed
him over to my friend, Mr. Lund, of Burnham, who I knew would
rear him if care, skill, and attention could do so.
Unfortunately, he never picked up his former vigour, and died
three or four days later.
I have kept the two unhatched eggs which I found in the nest
after my first catastrophe. When fresh they were exceptionally
handsome, being of a greenish-white ground colour heavily blotched
with orange-red spots--measurements respectively, 3 x 2-2 cm. and

All went quietly and uneventfully for the next few days. In
the meantime I had cut a cocoa-nut husk in half and cemented it care-
fully into a wooden box. Here was a nest that even a Pie could
not pull to hits.
For a few days prior to July 24th both birds were again
carrying and pretending to build nests in various places. On that
date I found the hen sitting. On the 27th there were five eggs in
the cocoa-nut husk; these were due to hatch about August 12th.
Shortly before this I went away for a short holiday and returned on
the night of the 19th, but I asked no questions about the Pies,
expecting to hear good or bad news in good time. Finally, I screwed
up courage and asked the momentous question.
Well! the worst had happened--apparently all the eggs had
hatched out. No one had gone near the birds except to provide
food, of which they had received an ample and assorted supply. Yet
all I found on the following morning was an empty nest, some half
shells, and one dead chick about five days old which the old birds had
deposited on a ledge in the aviary.
And--here endeth the Second Lesson.
Some wiseacres will say that I failed because I interfered too
much and inspected too often ; even if I did I have learned more and

Mr. Kenneth Woodward,
certainly written more than I should have done if success had been
given to me with less observation, but I should like to make it clear
that much of my spying was done from a greenhouse which is close
up to the aviary and from which point of vantage I could watch the
birds quite unseen by them.
Knowing what I do, I feel certain that I could rear these
birds successfully next year, but, alas! that will not be, for their
owner has very generously presented them to the Zoological Society.
That he did wisely I do not question, for, instead of pleasing a single
selfish aviculturist, he will be giving pleasure to scores of others also
interested in birds. Whether the Society will succeed where I have
failed remains to be seen. I do not wish Mr. Seth-Smith anything
but good luck, but at the same time I shall be nettled if he " wipes
my eye."
I have to thank him for the photo of the adult Blue and Black
Pie which he has kindly given me. The sexes are alike, but the hen
is a larger bird than the cock. This may be the rule, as stated by
Ridgway, or it may be due to the fact that the hen had the very best
of care since her importation, during which time she has won more
than one prize for her first owner.
Of the Corvidae which I have kept I prefer the present species to
the Occipital Blue Pie. Although the colouring is not so brilliant,
the birds themselves are more tractable and less predatory in
appearance. By far the most attractive of the wdiole genus, to my
mind, however, is the much smaller Chinese Blue-wdnged Magpie,
of which there have been very few on the market of late.

We all have our favorite bird, and mine is a Toucan or
Toucanette ( Aracari ), called the "Gentleman," and the freshest
thing I ever owned. He is now biting the pencil and my fingers as
I try to compose this letter ; but if the Editor wants my unscientific
jottings, let us start at the beginning. Looking around a shop
fifteen months ago, acquaintance was first struck up by scratching

his head thru the bars. The price was ascertained, and somebody
nearly died right there, and it wasn't the bird; but yet I knew
he would be mine, and he was nest day. As it was a new
importation, the bird remained in this store for seasoning, and I
used to play with him until one time the inspector, witnessing the
exhibition and the crowd which had gathered, voiced his objections
to a stranger playing with the firm's property. Explanations were
made and apologies accepted. The " Gentleman " changed his
boarding house right there and then. The name was given by the
butler, who marvelled at the variety and expense of his menu. One
day he bit me, and made a wonderful job of it, as the nail of the
first finger soon came off, and I had some sore hand with a nasty
saw cut across it. Petting ceased, and remained so for some months.
He had my goat, and I was afraid to touch him.
A white Java Sparrow sharing his room, 18 x 12 x 8, is not
molested, and, tho' finger-tame and petted, the " Gentleman " is
apparently not jealous. Not so with a Troupial in a rather large
brass cage. The door was one day left open, and Troupial was
rescued minus his scalp feathers, and considerably mussed and hurt
in the leg.
He dislikes the butler, and I believe the reason follows.
Eating lunch one day of Hamburger steak, bread and butter, apple
from pie, etc., we were longer than the others, and the table was
cleared all except the water glasses. When the first of these started
to go so did the " Gentleman," and he got what he went after, the
butler's hand, gripping and shaking it like a dog. The water
remained and the butler departed, whereupon his highness took
sundry and copious drafts, just as any regular bird should do
with his meals ! This is the only way I can account for the dislike,
as formerly the butler stood in better than I did.
These dark nights, upon return home, I hold my hand under
the electric light, which I turn on in the hall, and call the boy. Out
he comes and lights on the wing for a worm or grape and a talk.
The bird show is the " Gentleman's " delight. Everyone pats him,
and the more the better. But home the day after, not the usual
(if any) attention, and then let anyone go near him ! Some savage !
and is for a week or more.

My pet Toucan.
Has anyone tried this with their Toucans ? I know three
that do it, and probably it is a common trait. Breathe on the hind
quarter just under and at the tip of the wing, and watch him stand
on one foot, cock his head, swell up and open and place across his
back the wing you blew under. This posture is held for a long time,
and only relaxed gradually to normal. Then do it again. Brother,
it's fine !
Six months elapse, when out of a clear sky I see a title
flashed on the screen of a lady who tames birds and then by the
movies she proves it. You can imagine my excitement when her
subjects were shown to be Toucans. Naturally, the " Gentleman "
went boarding out. He is back now, and I am the boss. But what
a hump of curiosity he possesses! Everything must be picked and
pulled, and, with his powerful beak, his investigations are liable to
be very complete. Diamond rings (taking the finger along too) are
his specialty. Watch chains and buttons are substitutes. Girls
having none are not on his list of acquaintance. They are not, and
are all afraid. Furthermore, the " Gentleman " knows it and goes
for them. When I am shaving he sits on the arm of the mirror ;
eats his breakfast at the table -- oatmeal, bread in coffee, fruit and
butter balls. These latter he loves, and to take them away, slippery
as they are, is some job. Gum, jam and candy he will not eat. All
the rest, including snakes and mice, if you give them -- yes. To be
scratched is wonderful, and the operation is assisted by throwing out
all the feathers, that a fellow may have the full effect on his skin.
Purring accompanies same. When he is harsh, voicing displeasure,
watch out or get nipped! What is he now doing on the pencil ?
It should be his, but as I can't see it that way, my fingers get
it. When scolded he departs to the far corner to sulk (for a few
seconds only). Curiosity is the greatest trait. Open a draw and
he must see what is therein ; must also help (?) in the morning when
food for the day is being prepared, when cleaning cages, changing
water ; must investigate your shoe-laces and eyes-- in short, all and
everything.

At the end of summer the songs were hushed and silence fell
upon the birds. The migrants congregated on trees and telegraph
wire, and by October the last had departed for warmer climes. We
missed the persistent note of the Landrails, and the activities of the
Swifts and Swallows, but in autumn and winter there was no
scarcity of birds. Quite the contrary. The falling of leaves, laying
bare the bushes and branches, made the birds more visible, and
increasing severity of weather drove them to the residences and
workplaces of man for the purpose of getting food. Additionally, in
summer the birds are in pairs and scattered over wider remoter
areas, whereas in autumn and winter they flock and feed in fields
and meadows.
The autumn of 1916, though wet at times, was, on the whole,
fine and pleasant, but it passed quickly ; frost and snow occurred in
November, and winter was upon us. Then the wild birds resident
in this mid-Dorset valley were more noticeable and observable than
in the other seasons.
The birds I name as being found in Mid-Dorset have been
observed in a casual manner whilst going about a large farm at work,
or described by one of the men and substantiated by at least one
other witness. No doubt, could full time be given to the subject,
could a man spend a whole winter devoted to searching for and
examining the birds of a single area, the list, with details, might be
enormously extended, but that is a counsel of perfection. Most
of us have many things to do each day, of which working for a
livelihood is not the least, and the study of wild life is a side
issue.
Pigeons are plentiful in the woods. They were seen mostly
in early autumn, feeding on the ripe corn before and during harvest.
In winter they ventured near us less often, flying away in great
sweeping curves at the least alarm, and disappearing into the plan-
tations at top speed. Small parties up to about half a dozen in
number spent a good deal of time in the dairy meadows, otherwise

Mr. A. R. Williams,
Pigeons seldom visited us till the mild weather returned and spring
sowing started.
Rooks are one of the commonest birds. They trailed across
the sky in great flocks from woods to feeding grounds in the morn-
ing, returning noisily at night. They swarmed down on the ploughed
fields close behind the ploughing and harrowing, abounded in sheep
and cattle pastures, and showed much liking for clover fields. They
were far too numerous in the wheat fields after the autumn sowing,
and shooting and scarecrows deterred them but little. The extreme
cold of January, 1917, cut off many of their food sources. They
became silent, scattered, and spent hours perched on trees and
hedges. Dung-carting provided them with much food. Unfor-
tunately, they found a bigger supply of food than that. They started
pulling the ricks, particularly wheat-stacks. Not a rick was un-
touched. Some in remote parts of the farms had great holes several
yards across and a yard deep, from which Rooks had tugged the
straws, scattering them over the fields, and eating the grain.
Sparrows, Pheasants, Partridges, and the hard-billed birds followed
in their train to feast on corn. Shooting, hanging up their corpses,
scarecrows, netting round the ricks, and traps, were all employed,
but many bushels of corn went. As fast as possible the ricks were
thrashed out to prevent further depredations. Jackdaws accom-
panied the Rooks, as they always do.
Crows were uncommon, but early in February two Carrion
Crows were seen at the lambing-yard devouring the remains of a
dead lamb which had been left on the thatch of a pen.
Starlings were as numerous as Rooks. Their familiar whistle
was less often heard, being replaced by a stridulous cry, often of a
quarrelsome nature. They worked the fields in large flocks, and the
gardens and farmyards in small groups of a dozen or so. They are
marvellously quick in their movements, ranging over a wide area, yet
searching every inch of ground in swift zig-zag jerks, leaving little
for other birds to eat. Their winter plumage retains all its glossi-
ness, marked by little light brown spots apparently one on each
feather, giving them a spangled appearance. To the Starlings dung-
carting was a feast. They worked both the crew-yard and middens
whilst the carts were being loaded, and the heaps and spread

manure in the fields, devouring the innumerable dung-worms at
incredible speed. Their legs are dull and beaks blackish in winter,
instead of reddish-brown and bright yellow respectively.
Sparrows were most prominent in the autumn, when they
crowded the hedgerows and fields in chattering rushing flocks.
During winter they were quieter and more dispersed, but could be
found everywhere. They made themselves the self-invited com-
panions of Rooks, Starlings, and Finches. Whenever food was
obtainable Sparrows appeared. They scattered and searched in
pastures and fields, farm and dairy yards, gardens and orchards.
They hopped along pathways and roads, round doors and stables, and
shared food with the fowls. Sparrows are the general scavengers
and the most omnivorous feeders among birds. Sunny days they
perched in numbers on south-sloping roofs. The Hedge-Sparrow is
a brighter bird than the House-Sparrow, though the latter is so much
cleaner than his town brother that in the country the two are not
easily distinguished apart. The Hedge-Sparrow keeps more to the
fields, and has a much smaller, thinner beak than the House-Sparrow.
On a clear, frosty day the browns of the Sparrows' plumage show up
strongly, varying from chocolate to chestnut, and the greys are
light.
In this part of Dorset Finches are as common as Sparrows.
The Hawfinch is rarely seen, though there are a few about the
woods. Goldfinches are not general, but occur fairly frequently.
By the end of February the Goldfinch has assumed its brilliant
colouring, the scarlet round the base of the beak and the yellow
bars on the wings making it conspicuous. Linnets and Chaffinches
are plentiful, whilst Greenfinches and Bullfinches are countless.
Greenfinches work along the hedges and a short distance into the
fields, moving in brief wavering flights. Bullfinches scatter more,
and are as keen as Sparrows and Starlings on finding feeding-places
and working them thoroughly. After thrashing Finches descend on
the refuse in swarms. Considered altogether the Finch family
add greatly to the liveliness and beauty of the country-side in
winter. The Yellow-Hammer gets confused with the Finches, but
is distinguishable by its lemon-yellow head, neck, and underparts.
Hedgerows and banks with loose wild growth low down seem

Mr. A. R. Williams,
the favourite resorts of Blackbirds, whence they fly out or hop
through at the approach of passers-by. Severe weather drives them
to the dung-heaps, where they feed close to the men loading or
tipping and spreading. Standing a moment to watch with bright
eyes, darting on a worm, tugging it out, swallowing it with gusto,
hopping a yard or two, then repeating the performance, makes the
Blackbird a lively and interesting object. " Blackbird" is rather a
misnomer. Some are quite black, sooty, but the plumage varies up
to light brown in individuals, light enough to make countrymen
hesitate before pronouncing them to be Blackbirds. The lighter
colouring usually denotes females, but is not peculiar to them.
The general winter habits of Thrushes correspond closely with
those of Blackbirds. The larger and more speckled Missel Thrush is
a familiar resident in Dorset. It resorts less to the haunts of man
than the Song Thrush, keeping more to the fields and downs. The
common Thrush becomes very bold in severe weather, carefully
searching dung-heaps, stable and dairy yards, excavations, any place
.where the earth is disturbed, for food, also finding hidden snails and
cracking their shells on a stone, and paying little heed to the
presence of animals and men at work.
In late autumn and early winter considerable numbers of
Redwings fed in the water meadows. When the hard frosts set in
after Christmas they disappeared. The name " Redwing " must
have arisen from very careless observation, for it is not difficult to
see that the red is on the flanks under the wings, which are them-
selves brown.
The black markings and large amount of grey and buff and
white in the feathering easily distinguish Fieldfares from other
Turdinae. No bird suffered more from the harsh weather of January
and February, 1917. Dead Fieldfares were frequently picked up near
hedges. There appeared to be as many of them dead from cold or
hunger as all other birds together. Wrens, smallest of birds, came
safely through the great frost, and no dead ones were found. They
hopped in the most lively manner about the hedges, looking in
excellent condition, apparently not inconvenienced by the rigors of
the weather.
Robins were ubiquitous. Not in any numbers, for it is

unusual to see two at the same time, but every conceivable place was
graced by one of them, displaying its handsome blue-edged scarlet
breast, avoiding the company of other birds, except occasionally to
peck snappily at one and then fly away. Robins have notably slender
legs, and are altogether delicate-looking birds, yet endure winter
successfully. They are dainty and haphazard feeders, merely picking
up bits here and there, almost perfunctorily, in contrast to other birds.
Their fearlessness in the presence of man needs no emphasis. As a
cart was loaded with manure a Robin would perch and peck, merely
giving a quick hop as each forkful was thrown up, and snatching a
scrap out of it. A stable door left open would be followed by the
entrance of a Robin, darting amongst the horses' hoofs. When the
fowls were fed a Robin joined them. One hopped up to the men at
lunch in the fields, and finally perched on the toe of one of their
heavy boots, surveying the chances of crumbs from that vantage
point. A cottage bedroom window had a small pane of glass broken,
and through it a Robin entered several times, once Hying down-
stairs. Another was found in the harness-room, having got in by
a swing window left open a few inches. When we were thrashing
wheat one day in January a Robin flew often on to the machine as
it was working, and helped itself to corn. The trusting confidence
of the Redbreasts is generally respected, and they flourish in spite of
their rigid individualism.
Pied Wagtails, one of the most graceful and pleasing of
British birds, are well distributed throughout this district, and called
locally " Polly Dishwashers." Grey Wagtails are found less, keeping
away from buildings and cultivated land, preferring the streams and
ponds of the moors and uplands. Pied Wagtails show little fear of
human presence. They follow the ploughs and harrows picking up
food, search over the dung-heaps as they are tipped and spread in
the fields, and resort to the low-lying meadows in company with
many other birds which make wet places a habitat.
The existence of a river and several streams and ponds down
the valley, and the system of canalising and irrigating the adjacent
meadows during winter, so that they are partially flooded, attracts
many water-loving birds. Wagtails work these wet spots regularly,
so do Gulls, Plovers, Herons, Ducks, Water-hens, and Snipe. Other

Winter birds in Mid-Dorset.
birds, as Blackbirds and Thrushes, find the same places attractive.
During the early winter large numbers of Redwings came.
A few Herons visit us from southwards, from the woods
towards Wimborne and the River Stour. They come during the
night, feed in the watermeads and river, and return early in the
morning. Sometimes one delays, and is seen by daylight. I saw
one go hack, flying low over the farm, at eight o'clock. Another
morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I drove along one side of
the water-meadow and a Heron went up very slowly, rising after the
Gulls and Plovers with which it had been feeding. It turned and
sailed away to the south, with the slowest wing-beats I have ever
seen a bird give. The shape and lagging action of the wings, and
the backward-bent neck of the Heron cannot be mistaken. One
morning about ten o'clock I saw one standing motionless under a
hedge over a ditch. It waited whilst I walked more than halfway
across the meadow, then slipped through the hedge, and I did not
see it again. Late one night I stood at the open window of my
bedroom, and a big dark bird, with slowly-flapping vanes, sailed close
past and gave a loud, harsh cry-- almost a croak--very eerie in the
stilly darkness. I thought for the moment it was a Raven, but
everything points to its being a Heron.
Gulls are regular and daily visitors, following the field opera-
tions, and feeding wherever there is water. Their wings are notably
longer and more powerful than those of inland birds. The Gulls
are obviously visitors, as distinct from the local residents. Their
snowy slightly marked plumage, long graceful wheeling flights,
lengthy wings with curved tips, comparatively small boat-like
bodies, and occasional mournful cries, mark them out as creatures of
different environment from the land birds. They bring with them
suggestions of vast open spaces of sea and sky, of stinging salt
breezes, of azure expanses above and around, of white clouds and
sunshine, or dashing waves and surging spray on the coast.

BIRDS THROUGH THE YEAR.*

This book should be in the hands of every aviculturist. Well
written and as a rule accurate, it conducts the reader through the
ornithological year, from the first arrival of the spring migrants,
through busy summer and changing autumn to chilly winter and the
early songsters again. The reading matter is enjoyable, and graced
in places with imagery that is almost poetic. The illustrations,
though of unequal merit, are as a rule good, and add materially to
the value of the book.
The most delightful chapter, perhaps, deals with " the lonelier
hours," being a vivid and most poetical description of the glories of a
summer night. We read of the " cool grey stain " of daylight, of the
" dusk full of earth's perfumes, obscurely lit with flowers," of the
" soft veil of the June night," of the earth on cloudy summer nights
" lit with its own moon and stars," of constellations of blossom in
the dusky hedges, of white heads of clover shining in the pastures
like a Milky Way. Then we have a page on the pulsing activity of
the ghost moths as they swing and sway over the June meadow.
Next comes a disquisition on bird song, followed by an avian time-
table as the singers succeed each other through dusk to dawn.
The text abounds with happy phrases. The Swift is described
as " the most bird-like of birds "--though perhaps some of us would
prefer to give that title to the Albatross. The Robin's nest is a
Nightingale's "clipped at the edges" (p. 11); we read of the Buzzard
"spinning slow rings over the cliff" (p. 23), of Plovers and Water-
fowl " lightly dipped in sleep " (p. 161), of the Yellowhammer
" tracing golden semicircles about his hen" (p. 169), of the "flutter-
ing buoyancy " of the Sand-Martin (p. 118), and the sapphire Dragon-
flies "drifting among the sedges" (p. 188). The excellent and
practical chapter on feeding birds is worthy of close study, and in
discussing the diet of birds the authors pay a tribute to aviculture :
" Few field observers care to be aviculturists, but they are inferior to
the keeper of caged birds in this department of knowledge " (p. 310).

Review.
The illustrations are worthy of the letterpress. Many are in
colour ; of these we would specially mention the Swallow about to
feed her young as they perch on a willow stump, mouths agape and
wings aquiver. Excellent, also, is the Spotted Flycatcher and her
brood -- -the feathering of the nearer youngster is so well done that
one could almost rumple its plumage. Good, also, are the Blue Tit
and her young, the family of Wrens, and the carefully-drawn Cuckoo
facing p. 272. Miss Austen's Snow Buntings at their icy repast are
well set off by the chilly snowfield and its pale blue shadows.
The smaller illustrations are equally interesting. Some birds
are seen in motion, others in still solitude. Of the former we note
the Montagu Harrier as it floats along almost brushing the ground
(p. 21) ; the Barn Owl, its not distant cousin, following its example
(p. 246) ; and the soaring, circling Buzzard (p. 67). Among the
hermits we find the Dipper by the streamlet and the Bock Pipit
standing on its boulder like a sentinel on duty (p. 144). Then, again,
the Kazorbills (p. 338) give a wonderful impression of swaying move-
ment as they float on the water, buoyant as corks. Equally
successful are the Sand-Martins on p. 191, as they flutter moth-like
over the water. Finally, the Weasel, on p. 171, has been portrayed
in an attitude at once truthful and characteristic.
Unfortunately, the hook is marred by several errors. It is
incorrect to state that the eggs of Hawks or any other birds are
marked with blood-stains (p. 26), such colouring being invariably
derived from oorhodeine or other special pigment, such as oocyan
or ooxanthine. Had the authors been acquainted with the literature
of egg-pigments they would have known that such bodies are related
to bile rather than to blood. On p. 213, Arcliceopteryx is claimed as
"the" earliest bird, though Laopteryx of the Upper Jurassic was
probably contemporary with it. On p. 296 three errors occur. We do
not know what kind of person a "latter-day Winterton" may be; the
owner of Walton Hall was named Waterton. Mr. Seton Thompson
is a well-known naturalist, but with Mr. Thompson Seton we are
unacquainted. Baron Hans Berlepsch is a pioneer bird-protector,
but Baron Bwrlepsch is unknown to fame.
It seems to us a pity to attempt the illustration of eggs
without the aid of colour. Thus, the Moorhen's clutch on p. 47 is

quite unrecognisable, while the Guillemot egg on p. 139 belongs to no
species known to oology; those of the Sparrow Hawks facing p. 336,
though reproduced in colour, are poor and indistinct. As to the
birds themselves, the Wheatear on p. 2 has only one serviceable leg,
the left-hand limb obviously suffering from an atrophied gastro-
cnemial muscle. In the plate facing p. 16 the parent Wagtails
suggest the taxidermist's workroom rather than the streamlet; the
Blackbird on p. 162 is too corvine, and this error is repeated on
p. 180 ; the Robin on p. 170 is unrecognisable as such.
The authors contradict themselves. On p. 138 we are told,
correctly enough, that the wings of the Great Auk underwent
atrophy to the point of flightlessness. On p. 213 we read with
amazement that " We usually speak of the Ostrich or the Great Auk
as having ' lost ' the power of flight, hut it would probably he truer
to say that they failed to acquire it." With the Ostrich at any rate
the wings are obviously vestigial, tending to disappear unwanted
owing to the well-developed legs and feet: this process can he
studied under our eyes in domestic fowls. The authors, unfor-
tunately, seem to be totally ignorant of the difference between a
vestige and a rudiment, though the two conditions are poles apart.
Finally, on p. 92, we find the statement that the normal
temperature of " birds" is that of high fever in man--as if all birds
were alike in this respect; besides, medical opinion may well differ
as to what may he termed " high fever." Let us take the House
Sparrow as a typical bird, r The researches of Gavarrett and
Rosenthal have demonstrated that the body-heat of this small fowd
is as low as 39 08* C. as against 38-01 in the normal human intestine.
The free-roaming, ocean-loving Sea Gulls may well be assumed to be
full of vitality and strength, yet even in these the recorded tempera-
ture is only 37'8--lower than in man; and the Ostrich is content
with the same body temperature as our own. G. R.

Dr. W. T. Hornaclay writes : I am tempted to send you a photograph which
may well be called "An Object-Lesson in the Protection of Wild Fowl." The
picture was taken by our photographer in the Wichita National Bison Range, in
South-western Oklahoma, Oklahoma, U.S.A., about seven years ago, after the
Range was established and the preservation of all bird life within it seriously
began.
Eight years ago only an occasional pair or a very small flock of Wild Ducks
could be found on the waters of the small streams shown in the photograph. Now
the Ducks congregate there, to rest and feed, literally in thousands.
The last Passenger Pigeon that for twenty-one years lived in the Cincinnati
Zoological Gardens, and which finally became the sole survivor of its species, died
on September 1st, 1914, and its remains were sent to the National Museum at
Washington.
Perhaps you will be interested in the fact that the fund which I began to
raise by subscription, for the ^permanent protection of wild life, has now reached
$51,200. I have called it the " Permanent Wild life Protection Fund," and its
income is to be expended on the firing line for the next hundred years or more.
It is my intention to finally bring the fund up to $100,000, but for the pi&apos;esent the
war has interfered with my efforts.
It may be that you will be interested in a great fight waged in California by
the Portuguese and Italian game dealers and market-gardeners, and a few hotel and
restaurant keepers, to re-open the sale of game throughout the State of California.
They sought the repeal of the law against the sale of game. That law was enacted
after a great contest, and all sorts of unfair methods were resorted to to persuade
voters to give the " poor working man " a chance to buy Wild Ducks at $2 a pair !
The wild life protectionists of California are waging a great battle, and I feel very
sure that they will win.

Dear Sir, -- I am enclosing you some photos of the beautiful White Pelicans
of Oregon, which may perhaps be of use to you. I wish I could write something
of interest for you to use, but helas, I have little talent along those lines, much as
I love birds and Nature. We have spent the summer motoring in the mountains
of California and Oregon, fishing and camping. I could write a lot about camping
with an automobile; how one's tent slips on over the top of the car and is put up
in a few moments ; the perfect comfort of pneumatic mattresses pumped up with the
pump of the motor, also in a very few minutes ; of folding tables and armchairs,
cookstoves equipped with gasoline for fuel, rubber bath tub, guns and fishing tackle,
all finding their place in the roomy tonneau of a big Cadillac Eight, and of two
elderly people wandering from one beautiful spot to another throughout the
ong dry summer months of this lovely country ; but that would not be " bird
articles."

Mr K. Woodward writes : One of your far away members wonders if a
letter from " over here " would be welcomed by the Editor now that so many of the
older and experienced writers have sterner duties to attend. Aviculture as practised
in England does not exist in this country. We have no large private aviaries, no
magazines, and no shows to speak of. Some people keep a bird or two, generally
a canary. Some more than that, but those having twenty or over can be numbered.
This year our show is off. War material has to be shipped, and express
companies are not guaranteeing the arrival of poultry at the exhibition, so the birds,
cats, and cavies, which are exhibited at the same time and place, are knocked out.
Nevertheless, our little display each year produced 300 birds in the shelves, many
roller collections, and flight cages for exhibition. Ribbons were awarded in each
class, and trophies for the best bird and other specials. Breeding, as you can
imagine, is not a thriving industry; birds are not kept largely or out of doors in
natural surroundings, only Zebras, Minas, Javas, Grass Parakeets, Japanese Nuns
and the like are brought up in the bird room.
My own birds (sadly depleted now that the war has stopped importations)
live in cages 6 by 6 by 4 and somewhat similar measurements, having twigs,
nesting boxes, cocoa-nut husks, and bathing water all the time.
It was in the above cage, with forty birds therein, that a Yellow Grass
Parrakeet was reared by papa, the shock of its birth having killed mamma. How he
did it, with Rosellas, Love Birds, Weavers, and other inquisitive species and in
such a crowded " tenement," has always mystified me. The only help father
received was to have all the other birds, principally Japanese Robins, brushed
away from six meal-worms which were given every morning. This was the only
time that father was ever tame. He can't be caught now without a net and a
fight. January and February, with snow outside and cold, was the time it
happened.
The little Finches in another cage lay fresh eggs all the time, but no one

The English aviaries must be wonderful. The pictures and lists of breeding-

The above does not apply to the zoological parks, but even here all the

New York. The display at the Bronx Park is complete and tastefully shown.

Dear Sir, --I herewith tender you an article of mine on the " Mounted Bird-
Exhibit of the United States National Museum at Washington " ; it has been pre-
pared especially for the ' Avicultural Magazine,' and my hope is that you may find
it available for some one of your future issues. I see the Journal at the National
Museum and much admire its excellent qualities.

[We welcome Dr. Shufeldt's paper as widening the scope and practical use-
fulness of aviculture -- holding, as we do, that our science is capable of indefinite
expansion, and by no means limited to the mere keeping of live birds. The study
of living creatures is of the greatest service not only to the arts ancillary to
zoology (such as taxidermy) but also to remoter pursuits, such as agriculture and
medicine. We shall return to this subject later. -- G. R.J
A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE.
M. Pichot writes : At one time, Virginian Quails were very numerous in the
United States, but they have so far fallen victims to wanton shooters and the
purveyors of the market (" game-hogs," as G. 0. Shields so justly branded the
pot-hunters in 1897), that stringent measures have had to be taken to prevent their
utter destruction. On December 17th, 1911, the Executive Committee of the New
York Zoological Society was assembled in the Administration Buildings discussing
the plans for securing a five-year close season for the persecuted Bob Whites, when
a whole covey took up its station under the very windows of the room, the birds
calling loudly to each other. There were eleven of them, and they had been seen
twice before in the park, but on this particular occasion it seemed as if they were a
deputation bringing in a petition, and no doubt their timely appeal carried the vote !
THE PAUCITY OP WILD BIRDS.
To the Editor of the ' Avicultural Magazine.'
Sir, --Dr. Butler is fortunate in having seen so many wild birds at
Beckenham ; but, for all that, the serious reduction in their numbers has been, and
is, most marked.
Last winter, in spite of perpetually feeding those that congregated round the
house, Thrushes and Robins died amongst others, and last summer only one pair

of the former could be seen. Many people have told me the same tale from various
parts of England, and I fear that it was not only the weaker birds that succumbed.
In Essex, a former gamekeeper of mine, who was quartered in that county, told me
that it was piteous to see the birds dead everywhere, even frozen in nooks of hay-
stacks. And what about Golden-crested Wrens and Long-tailed Titmice? They
were almost exterminated, so that it must take several years before their numbers
are anything like normal. Where, too, are the Fieldfares and Redwings ? It is
good to be optimistic, but there is no doubt whatever that Song Thrushes and many
others are conspicuous by their absence. I have a very large lawn here, on which
Blackbirds and Thrushes used to hop about. I never see the latter species now,
and only two or three males of the former.

kindly give me the benefit of your advice.
I have at present (in this room incidentally) a pair of Shamahs, unrelati d,
which reared eleven young last summer. In my little outdoor unheated aviary I
have a young aviary-bred brother and sister (they experienced a frost a week
ago and look very fit -- "in a good hour," etc.). I thought at first of selling these,
but decided to keep them over the winter in case anything happened to either of
the parents. Now I can't bring myself to part with them, and contemplate mating
them in addition to the parents. Is there any great objection to mating brother
and sister ? I have not been able to arrange an exchange of cocks with anyone. The
only alternative these times would be to mate either with some British species --
Robin, for instance. What would you think of this? I think the parents, with
any luck, should breed again. They are both in excellent fettle at present.
I have had such numbers of inquiries for Shamahs. I think #10 would
readily be obtained for a pair just now ! I have so few birds at present that I can
give both pairs compartments very nearly to themselves, which is a great con-
sideration. I shall be so very much obliged if you will advise me (1) as to mating
brother and sister ; (?) as to mating with some British species if possible. I don't
know how I shall manage live food for them all!

YOUNG SHAMAHS.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Low :
Inbreeding is to be avoided if possible, as the offspring are liable to be weak;
still there is no doubt that it occurs pretty frequently among wild birds ; so, perhaps,
would not matter much if not persisted in. I think it would be preferable to
attempting to cross a Shamah with a Robin, both being very pugnacious birds ; you
don't want to have a Shamah killed, as it certainly might be if aitacked by a
Robin.
If Shamahs were cheap birds I should say try it by all means; because, if

successful, the hybrid would be most interesting; as it is, I strongly advise you not
to risk it. Sell the young if you can get a good offer for them.

MORE ABOUT FEATHER-PATTERNS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.94602724" page_id="32704434"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
Dear Dr. Renshaw, --The photograph of an Eagle which you propose to use
as an illustration to my paper has suggested another point to me. As you observe
in your letter, the feathers on the breast have lost the central shaft stripe, while
those lower down still retain it; which seems to indicate distinctly that the breast-
markings were developed first.
Now, in the Turdidce , the young in their nestling plumage all have throat
and breast more or less spotted ; that is to say, the shaft-streaks persist ; but later
in life many of the smaller forms, as, for instance, our Robin, Nightingale, and
many of the Warblers, have lost this character ; whereas others have retained it only
on the flanks, and in the case of the Barred Warbler the later development of a
crescentic border to the feathers has been reached ; whilst on the coverts, wings,
and rump shaft-streaks have been modified, either so as to darken a great portion
of the feather or to form additional crescentic bars.
It seems probable that the habits of the different species will explain why
certain of these Thrush-like birds have developed markings of this character in
their adult plumage, when others have lost them ; thus the Barred Warbler, being
a skulking bird, frequenting tangled undergrowth in thickets and plantations, would
be less conspicuous in its barred markings than if more uniformly coloured.
Then, again, if the modification of shaft-streaks commenced with the throat
and breast-feathers one can understand why that portion of a bird's plumage is
so frequently occupied by a dark or uniform belt of colour.
I hope other bird-students with younger and better brains will follow up this
subject : it seems to me to be worth coirsidering.
Yours very sincerely,
January 17 th, 1918. A. G. Butler.

THE EVOLUTION OF FEATHER-PATTERNS: CHANGE OF COLOUR
WITHOUT A MOULT.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970708785714286" page_id="32704434"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
Dear Sir,--I was much interested in reading the letter by Dr. Butler, in
which he refers to the change of colour which may occur in the feathers of certain
birds without a moult.
I have frequently noticed a remarkable deepening in the pink shade of
Roseate Cockatoos' breasts when the birds came into breeding condition in the
early summer, at a time when no feathers were dropped.
I have also noticed that the crimson head and bib of a cock Yellow-mantled
Parrakeet (and presumably therefore of an ordinary Rosella) lose their brilliance and
turn to a duller bricltish shade quite suddenly when the moult begins in July,
although there has been no perceptible fading of the plumage during the preceding
nine months. Some naturalists have asserted most positively that the repigmenta-
tion of feathers is quite impossible, and they have denied its occurrence even in the
Touracos, where the phenomenon was at one time considered an established fact.
My own experience with Parrots has, however, converted me to Dr. Butler's

to be cast, and that colouring matter may sometimes pass from the basal gland
throughout the whole structure.

[We were much impressed with the truth of the living-feather theory in May
1915, when inspecting the beautiful Owl Parrot, which under the care of Mr. Seth-
Smith broke all records for this species in captivity, having lived over four years in
the Zoo -- i. e., more than twice the span of any other individual, at home or
abroad. The plumage of this bird was a bright sap green colour, shining with a
tine glaze as if enamelled, and in the bloom of condition. -- G. R.j

THE BALANCE OF NATURE

<bodyText confidence="0.988498090909091" page_id="32704435"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
Dear Dr. Rknshaw, -- I have read Dr. Butler's article on ;i The Balance of
Nature" with much interest, but as far as my observation goes I fear that in
this neighbourhood at any rate, it will be long ere certain species make good their
losses, some seem even to have disappeared altogether.
Possibly a few observations on the subject may be of interest and induce
other members to write their experience.
Before last winter Golden-crested Wrens abounded, Long-tailed Tits were
common, and Cole Tits extremely so; this year I have not seen any at all of the
two hist, and only one of the last-named species.
Green Woodpeckers are now comparatively seldom heard ; I have only seen
two individuals, but it is likely that they may be more plentiful in such of the
big woods as are yet left; the Pied and Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers are never
very much in evidence, but I have seen and heard them both this summer.
Two pairs of Marsh Tits formerly frequented this garden, I have not seen
them at all, but possibly they went to the bogs. About half the usual number
of Blue Tits and a couple of Great Tits came to the bird table, last year they
swarmed.
Nuthatches have been severely thinned but certainly one brood was reared
in this garden and I think remains with us.
We have not nearly as many Song Thrushes nor Pledge Sparrows.
Pied Wagtails are never very plentiful here owing to lack of water, and
I think we have about the usual number of them. Robins are fairly plentiful
and I have seen several Wrens.
Tree Creepers are about as usual.
Plawfinches had become comparatnely common but this year our peas were
untouched and I have neither seen nor heard them. Bullfinches are still plentiful,
Goldfinches, Linnets, and Chaffinches all very abundant, Blackbirds and Starlings
over abundant; Owls, especially the Tawny, appear to be numerous. Swifts,
Swallows, and Martins not noticeably fewer, there are not many ponds to
entice them.
I should like to emphasise that I am only recording my own observations
made over a very limited area; still before last winter I frequently saw five or six
pairs of Goldcrests working the spruces opposite our house and families of the

termed the most fish-like of birds. Equally, with their smooth,
shining bodies and magpie coloration, does a troop of swimming
Penguin suggest a school of marvellously small cetaceans. More-
over, some of the latter (dolphins, for instance) have the muzzle
prolonged into quite a bird-like beak ! Penguin further resemble
cetaceans in having a warm coat of blubber under the skin, and
differ from nearly all other birds in the close setting of their
feathers.
As we saw last month, most birds are not uniformly feathered
all over, but have their plumage arranged in definite tracts, separated
by bare patches or apteria. Penguins have no apteria, save a small
bare patch on the under surface, to allow the sitting bird to satis-
factorily incubate her egg. The feathers themselves are most
remarkable, recalling the scales of reptiles, and on the forearm are
even moulted in a sheet, like the skin of a snake.

As the seals are among mammals, so are the penguins among
birds. Perfectly adapted for an aquatic existence, they are as much
out of place on land as are their mammalian parallels. As the
limbs of seals are specialised for swimming, so are the wings of
Penguins modified for this mode of progression. On land, the
Penguin is at a disadvantage and walks awkwardly. Usually it
remains erect, moving with a curious waddling gait, but when
closely pursued, it drops to the ground and, aided by its flipper-like
wings, is able to travel more rapidly. When crossing rough ground
it leaps from rock to rock, balancing carefully with its stumpy
wings.
In its natural element, however, the Penguin is a creature
transformed. It darts about with incredible rapidity, so swiftly that
the eye can scarcely follow its movements. The wings are moved
synchronously, not alternately, as has often been stated. The feet
play no active part in swimming, except possibly as an aid in
steering, and trail helplessly behind, bottoms upward.
The Penguins are an isolated group, having no near relatives.
It is evident that they formed an early branch from the avian stem,
and they retain many primitive characteristics. The feathers are
poorly developed, and scale-like, especially those of the wings, where
the primaries are hardly differentiated from their coverts. Thejgfcues

on the Jackass or Black-footed Penguin. 143
of the wing are flattened and the joints are stiff, so that the entire
appendage acts from the shoulder as an inflexible paddle.
It is of interest to note that the extinct Great Auk exhibited
a development parallel to that of the Penguin, to which it was not
closely related. Its flightless condition was not due to any unusual
structural developments as in the antipodean birds, but simply to the
very diminutive size of the wing, which was perfectly formed.
Living Penguins are always difficult to obtain, and hitherto
we have not been able to give our occasional specimens thoroughly
adequate quarters, with salt water. Early this spring, however, a
single Black-footed Penguin arrived at the Zoological Park. He was
placed in the diving birds' tank in the Aquatic Bird House for a
time, and then, as spring appeared, he was quartered with the
Walrus as a companion, where he prospered. In July five more
specimens were obtained, and were introduced at once to the single
occupant of the pool. After a satisfying bath in the artificial salt
water provided, they at once made themselves at home, and now
form an attractive exhibit. The potential energy represented by the
extensive layer of fat stored beneath their skins should enable them
to withstand any degree of cold to which they are likely to be
subjected at this latitude.
Intellectually, Penguins are not the most advanced of birds.
Once they have become accustomed to confinement in dry quarters
and to receiving food from the hand of their keeper, it is exceedingly
difficult to persuade them to avail themselves of the privileges of the
bath, and to secure their food in a normal manner. Thus, at first,
our little flock suffered somewhat from the heat, refusing to enter
the cooling water unless compelled to do so, neither could they
be persuaded to feed on the killi-fishes with which the pool was
supplied. After a short period of training, however, they reverted
to more normal habits, and now pursue the fishes with remarkable
agility. Also, they have deigned to accept the hospitality of a
tarpaulin stretched over the rocks in a corner of their enclosure,
affording them much-needed protection from the heat of mid-day.

BIRDS OF THE GAMBIA.*
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.960349647058824" page_id="32704448"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
By E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.B.
( Travelling Commissioner , Gambia).
The Gambia, although the smallest of the British West
African possessions, has a large and varied bird population. This is
partly the result of its geographical position, and partly of its
topography-- a mighty river and its banks. The first means that it
is the object (or on the line of march) of two double migrations, one
from the north in October with its return in the following March or
April, the other from the south at the beginning of the rains, June
or July, of birds from the more equatorial parts, which come to breed
in Senegambia, of which great territory the little Gambia may be
said to form the core, at any rate from a bird's point of view. These
visitors from the south leave us after the rains, their departure being
spread out over several months -- October to January. Our normal
resident population is therefore increased at these times, though the
increase due to our northern visitors is usually a matter of days or
weeks only, the great majority of the migrants passing on to a more
remote destination. The rainy season influx, on the other hand,
lasts the whole of that season, our visitors then coming in to settle
for the definite business of breeding.
Here, realising the difficulty of compressing an account of our
varied avifauna within the limits of a single article, I must content
myself with notes on the commoner or more conspicuous members of
the different orders and families which occur within the limits of the
Gambia, although the result is nothing much more than a list.
If the average man here were asked what was the typical
Gambia bird, the answer would in practically every case be the
" Bush-fowl " (Francolinus bicalcaratus), a bird widely distributed
throughout N.W. and W. Africa, for in Africa most people's interest
in the birds is sporting rather than ornithological, and this game
bird comes easily first in most men's minds, providing as it does
good sport and good " chop."
The Game Birds therefore will form a good starting-point.

Besides the " Bush-fowl," three other Francolins occur, but none of
these are common. Another game bird, locally known as the " Stone
Bush-fowl," which is found in parties of six to ten among the
bamboos on the ironstone ridges, is Ptilopachys fusca, a bird about
the size of and very like a hen bantam. Guineafowl are common in
many parts of the country and provide good food, if not the good
shooting we owe to the " Bush-fowl." In the winter months Quail
(either Goturnix coturnix or capensis ) visit us and are then frequently
to be met with in pairs in the millet fields.
Of the Sand-Grouse we only have one species, Pterocles
quadricinctus, a beautiful bird in which the chest of the male is
banded with stripes of deep brown and white. These are common
all the year round, but a great increase in their number is noticeable
in June and December, when those which breed in the desert are
passing through on their way to or from their nesting haunts.
Two species of Bustard are resident with us ( Otis senegalensis
and melanogaster), the first being about three pounds in weight, the
second about seven. A few of a much larger bird, probably Eupo-
dotis arabs, visit us during the winter months. All these Bustards
are excellent eating, but even the smaller ones are comparatively rare
and not to be obtained any day like the " Bush-fowl."
Another chief supplier of the Protectorate official's larder is
the Pigeon family, which is numerously represented in the Gambia.
First come the lovely green, yellow and mauve " Fruit Pigeons,"*
which are more or less migratory, as they move about the country,
according to the time of ripening of the different wild fruit trees
on which they feed. Besides this brilliantly coloured fruit-eating
species, at least five species of Dove are common, the largest being
Turtur se?nitorquatus, popularly known here as the " Black Pigeon,"
while a larger species still is the " Khun " or " Guinea Pigeon,"!
which is only found in Khun Palm (Alyssus) districts, and which is
certainly diminishing in numbers with the increase in the number of
trading stations, which of necessity encroach on many of its haunts.
Of the Waders, among the more noticeable are the Spurwing

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
Jaganas, long-toed, short-winged, chestnut-coloured birds, which in
different parts of the world are sometimes known as " Lily-trotters,"
and by the natives here as " Water-chickens." At the commence-
ment of the rains Painted Snipe usually visit us in fair numbers.
Some ten species of Duck are inhabitants of the Gambia.
These vary in size from the large black and white Spurwing Goose
down to the little " Cotton Teal," both of which are resident with us,
as also is the Knob-billed Duck, while Tree-Ducks ( Dendrocygna)
invade us in huge hosts at the beginning of the rains and remain till
about January, a certain number indeed remaining right up to the
arrival of the next influx, though they then have to move about the
country, as the swamps on which they feed dry up one after the other.
Among winter visitors from the north I have seen and shot the
common European Teal, which appears to be a regular migrant to
this country.
The Heron family is well represented, the most numerous
being the White Egrets, of which we have three species, two entirely
white, the third, the " Cattle Egret," white, with a buff back. The
last is commonly known here as the " Tick-bird " or " Cow-bird,"
from its constant association with the herds of cattle which are
such a conspicuous feature of the Gambian landscape and such an
important factor in the native cecology. Other species are the Black-
necked Heron, a very similar bird to the Common Heron of Europe,
which is also found here, the large and handsome Goliath Heron, the
little Mangrove Bittern, and lastly the aberrant short-legged form,
the " Hammerhead " (Scojms), locally known here as the " Jola
King," which is to be seen on every swamp, and whose enormous
nests on water-side trees are so frequent along the banks of the river
and its creeks, anywhere above the mangrove area, as to remind one
of lamp-posts or telegraph poles along a street at home.
Storks are represented by the everywhere abundant " Mara-
bout," and the taller but much less common " Saddle-bill."*
Pelicans, Cormorants, and Darters are common along the
river, as also are the purplish-black Hagedash Ibises, while the
latter's white, black-necked relative, the Sacred Ibis, is also a well-
known though rarer Gambian bird. Among the most noteworthy of
Ephippiorhynclms.

our sea-birds are Terns, large and small, and the Grey-capped, 15 the
Lesser Black-hacked, and other Gulls.
Vultures are everywhere abundant and perform the still much-
needed and useful work of scavengers. The commonest species is
the black Necrosyrtes monachus, hut the much larger brown African
Griffon [Gyps) is also almost as plentiful in many places up river.
Hawks and Eagles are numerous. Of the latter the most
striking is the very handsome, white-headed, brown-backed Fish-
Eagle,! which is to be seen anywhere along the river. The largest
is probably the Crowned Hawk-Eagle, [ a crested grey and white (or
in juvenile plumage brown and white) bird of a particularly noble
mien. Other Eagles are the Bateleur,S black with red beak and
talons, the black and white Vulturine Sea-Eagle, |j and the smaller
but distinguished-looking Black-crested Eagle. * **
Of the Hawks, many species of Goshawk, Harrier, Kite,
Kestrel, etc., down to the small Cuckoo-Falcons are common.
Owls, too, are numerous, and are all held by the natives as
birds of ill-omen. The largest is the Grey Eagle Owl, the smallest
a Scops. We also have a Barn Owl, which appears to be identical
with the English species.
Three species of Parrot are found in the Gambia: (1) a
" Ringneck " (Palaornis docilis) ; (2) the " Senegal Parrot,"&amp;quot; 55 &amp;quot; a grey-
headed, green-backed, yellow-breasted bird, rather larger than the
" Ringneck," but with a short tail; and (3) the Brown-necked
Parrot, tf a much larger bird with an enormous beak. The first two
are common everywhere, and frequently kept caged or with clipped
wings, the " Senegal " making a particularly attractive pet. The
third, on the other hand, is only found in that part of the river
where the mangroves, among which they breed, are at their best. It
is only rarely caught, and is not at all easily reared.
Cuckoos are numerous. The European species is with us
during the winter, while its African J J relation comes to us in April
and at once begins his well-known and eventually exasperating note.

Dr. E. Hopkinson,
Others are the Pied Crested Cuckoo* and other species of the genus
Goccystes. The Golden Cuckoof is found in the more wooded parts
during the rains, but is a very rare bird, which used to he much
sought after by the native skin hunters, as they could get a large
price for a stuffed specimen. Eecently, however, this species has
been put on the list of protected birds, and this perhaps may lead to
an increase in its numbers, but I do not think it likely, for we have
but little country really suited to a bird of its habits, and, anyhow,
protection in this little strip of territory, to which it is only a visitor,
can have but little effect on a species which ranges so widely in
adjacent parts of Africa. Since 1914, too, the war has stopped the
demand for skins, and, as a consequence, all skin-hunting, so that if
our protection (aided as it has been in this unexpected way) has been
of any use to this bird, we ought to shortly notice a distinct increase
in its numbers.
The last Cuckoo needing mention is the " Coucal," J a large,
clumsy-looking, brown and buff bird, which is absolutely devoid of
fear, and is seen everywhere hopping or flying heavily from bush to
bush.
Bar bets and Woodpeckers, of which several species are
common, will lead us to the Kingfishers. Of these the black and
white Pied Kingfisher S is the most numerous, and can be seen
everywhere from the sea-coast right up the river and on every patch
or pool of water of any size elsewhere. Two large blue and black
red-billed Kingfishers are also conspicuous birds of the river banks,
while a small, blue-winged, grey-breasted bird of the same genus, |j
the striped Kingfisher, takes their place in drier localities.
Lastly comes that lovely little gem, the Tiny Kingfisher,*! a
crested bird only about half the size of the English species, w&apos;hose
chief colours are cobalt, rufous, and black.
The Hornbills are represented by three residents: the large
Ground Hornbill ** and two much smaller arboreal species, one black
and white, the other brown.

Of the Turaeos two species are common, the Grey* (the
" Kowkow ") and the "Blue"! (the " Kowkow King"), while a
third, the Green Turaco.j a rather smaller bird, is much rarer and
very local.
During the winter we are visited by the common Hoopoe,
while the Wood Hoopoe,S a black, long-tailed bird with white-spotted
wings, is a resident.
Bee-eaters, too, are very numerous. Of these the Dwarf ; and
the Red * appear to be permanent residents, although they move
about the country a good deal, while two or three other species of
green Bee-eater are only visitors, usually in large flocks and during
the rains.
Rollers: The "Blue Jay," or Senegal Roller, ** is the commonest
representative of this family in the Gambia, but three other species
are also numerous : the Blue-bodied, the White-naped, and the Broad-
billed Rollers.11 The latter is a crimson, blue, and buff bird, built
somewhat on the lines of a Swallow, which spends the greater part
of the day resting on the tree-tops, sallying forth towards evening to
hawk in flocks of flies and other insects till long after the sun has set.
Of the Nightjars, the Pennant-winged j \ is the most note-
worthy. This bird has one feather-shaft in each wing prolonged to
end in a racket-shaped enlargement, and these, bobbing about behind
it as it flies, make it look like an Owl or other large bird being
mobbed by a couple of Sparrows. It is quite common in the
Gambia.
Our common Swift is a dull black, white-rumped bird
(Cypselus affinis ), and is a resident here -- at any rate, some appear
to be always with us. The European Swift is a regular winter
visitor, but I think usually only makes a short stay on his way to
and from a more southerly destination.
The various European Swallows are winter visitors in large
numbers, while the Senegal Swallow, a large bird with bright rufous

belly ancl a very deeply-forked tail, comes to us in April or May to
remain to breed here during the rains.
Of the other Passerine birds, Flycatchers are numerous (as
they ought to be in this country where insect life is so abundant),
and all sorts of Warblers, from the resident Grass Warblers to the
Nightingale and other visitors from the north, Wagtails (the majority
winter visitors), Babblers, and Bulbuls, both as residents and
migrants, Shrikes of many kinds, Golden Orioles, and Sunbirds are
all represented.
The remaining families to be dealt with are the Starlings,
Finches, and Weaver-birds. Of the first, the most noticeable from
their numbers, their tameness, and their noise, are the Glossy
Starlings,* of which three species are very common, one long-tailed
and two short, while a third, the Amethyst Starling,! mainly a rainy
season visitor only, is one of the most beautiful birds of the Gambia.
The chief representatives of the Finches are two Sparrows
(the Senegal Sparrow J and the Bock Sparrow S), and two Serins
(the Grey jj and the Green Singing Finches *), the last-named being
the only commonly kept cage bird in this country, though large
numbers of the next family (the Weavers) are caught for sale and
export to Europe.
The Weaver family in the Gambia include Whydahs, true
Weavers, Waxbills, and Mannikins. Of the first the Paradise and
Pin-tailed Whydahs are common, while the Yellow-backed is much
more local in its haunts. Among the Weavers are various sorts of
Yellow Weavers,** commonly called "Palm-birds," the Black Textors,
which make huge community-nests in cotton or other large trees in
the native villages, and the Bishops,ft so noticeable during the rains
from the brilliant red and black or yellow and black of the males in
their breeding plumage, and their dancing, hovering flight above the
long grass, as they show off to their plainly-clad mates sitting or
building below. Our Mannikins are the ubiquitous " Bronze
Mannikin " and its much larger relation the " Magpie Mannikin,"

both pied birds, which are found in large flocks, with which the two
Gambian Sparrows are fond of associating.
Our commonest Waxbills are Firefinches, Cordonbleus, Zebra,
and Orange-cheeked Waxbills, which form the larger part of the
collections in the bird-catchers' cages, which are exported in such
large numbers from the neighbouring French port of Dakar in
Senegal. Rarer members of this family are the " Aurora Finches,"
the Yinaceous Waxbill, the Quail Finch, and the Spotted Firefinch,
all most desirable cage-birds, but, fortunately from their point of
view, either not numerous anywhere or very local in the habitat; at
any rate, not so easy to catch as their better-known relations.
Although the Gambia has been so long a British colony, no
book on its birds has yet appeared, if we except Swainson's :: ' Birds
of Western Africa' (1843), which dealt with birds (skins) received
(one gathers from the introduction) mainly from the Gambia, as the
chief outlet of Senegal produce. More recently a list of Gambian
birds was given in the Appendix to Moloney's ' Forestry of West
Africa f (1887), and in the ' Ibis ' two papers on this subject have
appeared (Rendall, 1892, p. 218, and Budgett, 1901, p. 481), while the
writer of this article contributed (1909 omvards) to ' Bird Notes,' the
Journal of the Foreign Bird Club, a series of notes on Gambia's birds,
of which the material above-mentioned formed the basis, reinforced
by his own observations during a number of years' service in the
Protectorate and the information provided by other works dealing
with the Ornithology of Africa generally. The same hand was also
responsible for the chapter on birds in Reeve's book on the Gambia

The Great Touraco.
THE GREAT TOURACO (Corythaeola vel
Schizorhts cristata).
By J. Delacour.
(Translated by the Editor from the 4 Bulletin de la Societe Nationale
d&apos;Acclimatation de France. 1 )
The war ancl the submarine campaign have hindered the
importation of exotic animals into France, but they have not
entirely stopped it. Thus it was that I was able to receive at the
beginning of the year a very interesting package from the Gaboon,
in which was found a superb bird--the Great Touraco.
The family of the Musophagidse is particularly attractive;
the species which compose it have not only an elegant form, united
to brilliant colours, but their character and habits also constitute
them the most agreable of birds to keep in captivity.
The different Touracos are always rare enough in collections,
in spite of their hardy temperament and their readiness to breed
in aviaries. I even believe that people had never hitherto seen
a live specimen of the Great Touraco.
This bird, much bigger than its congeners, measures about
75 cm. in length ; it has the outlines of a Pheasant, or rather of a
Crested Guan, whose general appearance it somewhat recalls.
The Great Touraco is entirely arboreal; like the other members
of its family, it scampers over the branches, which made many
visitors to my Buffon Touracos exclaim "Talk about squirrels . . . !"
One feeds it on bananas, apples and other fresh fruit, on
dried figs and raisins, and meat cut small. It refused meal-worms,
Gaurasius, and other insects. Its behaviour is distinct enough from
that of other Touracos, its prominent and brilliant beak and its
unique crest confer on it a distinctive physiognomy, while the great
development of its wings and tail give it marked individuality.
If other individuals were imported, it would be interesting
to try to breed them, it ought not to be more difficult than breeding
Button&apos;s Touraco.
(An excellent coloured figure one-quarter the natural size
accompanied this account. We hope that some day the Great
Touraco may be seen in our aviaries on this side of the Channel.

Sunbirds in captivity : Past, present and future. 153
In her charming book, ' By the Waters of Africa,' reviewed in this
issue, Miss Lorimer says of an allied species, " When we have our
lunch on the verandah, the brilliant-plumaged plantain-eater comes
out of his cage and sits on the Governor's shoulder, and takes pieces
of bread out of his hand. It is a gorgeously beautiful bird, and
quite common in this country. It is long and sleek, and has smooth
feathers of the most dazzling blue; there is not a mark upon it of
any other colour. When it stands quite still on its perch it looks
as if it were made of blue enamel." On p. 251, she adds, " One
day we saw two glorious plantain-eaters. They flew across the road
in front of us, with their wings outstretched in the full sunlight.
They were the bluest and most radiant visions imaginable, far
more like the illustrations of birds you see in fairy stories than
the real thing."--G. R.)

By E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.B.
The Sunbirds are such a recent addition to the ranks of cage-
birds, among which they are now firmly established, that for their
past history as such, there is no need for search in far-back and
often forgotten records. As a matter of fact most of these are to be
found within the covers of the ' Avicultural Magazine,' and that, too,
since this century began. Years before Sunbirds were dreamt of as
cage-birds, or at any rate when they were no more than a dream, the
Avicultural Society and its Magazine was flourishing ; it saw their
debut, it saw their establishment. May both long continue to
increase and multiply in their respective spheres.
Until we come to about the end of last century, although no
doubt people had been tempted to try to keep these birds in captivity
in their native countries, there is but little recorded of them. The
family is not even mentioned in Dr. Russ' great work. The earliest,
and indeed the only, mention of any early attempt to keep Sunbirds
in captivity I find, is in the introduction to the Sunbird volume (16)
of Jardine's ' Naturalists' Library,' which was published in 1843. Here

Dr. E. Hopkinson
the editor, quoting " Barrow, Travels in South Africa," says that
there one species was often kept in cages for its song. They were
fed (but only maintained with difficulty) on sugar and water, which,
as the writer says, could not be sufficient to afford them proper support.
The first attempt to import them into England was, I believe,
that made in 1897 by Mr. Finn with some Indian species. These he
tells us in the ' Avicultural Magazine ' for 1899, p. 42, were all Ame-
thyst-rumped Sunbirds (A. zeylonica) with a single Purple (A. asicitica)
among them. Only one lived to reach the Zoo, and that was the
single Purple Sunbird, which, however, did not survive there longer
than a fortnight. Its arrival nevertheless constituted the first exhibi-
tion there of any Sunbird, and I do not know that any had been pre-
viously seen elsewhere abroad. Regarding this particular bird, Mr.
Finn tells us that it was in half-colour when obtained in the middle of
July, but by the first week in August had changed to the brown and
yellow non-breeding plumage. None of the Amethyst-rumps, he
says, showed any sign of change of colour. In Oates and Blanford's
' Birds of India ' it is stated that there is no seasonal change in the
male plumage of an Indian Sunbird. Is this the case or not, or is
the Purple Sunbird an exception to the general rule ? This question
can no doubt nowadays be answered by some of those who have kept
and are keeping these birds, and I hope that we may see in these
pages the answer to this and the other questions I shall ask. In
most African species a special nuptial plumage, is, I believe, the
rule.
From this date till 1906 the Magazine never mentions
Sunbirds. In that year a Sunbird made its first appearance on the
English show bench, Mr. Hawkins showing at the Crystal Palace in
February a dying Malachite, an inauspicious beginning indeed, which
one would never have believed would be the prelude to the changed
condition of affairs, which now holds after such a few years' interval.
On p. 209 of the 1906 volume the owner of this bird tells us its
history. It was one of the few survivors of these brought from
South Africa by Mr. Hamlyn. Mr. Hawkins writes as follows:
" Some birds are difficult to adapt to conditions of travel
and captivity, and I think the Sunbirds may be fairly classed
with these. Mr. Hamlyn lost about 85 per cent, of those he
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.981206078947368" page_id="32704459"  page_num="155" year="" vol="">
on Sunbirds in captivity : Past, present and future. 155
attempted to bring over on his last return journey, although he
attended to them himself. Of the few that arrived I received
four on January 15th last."
Two of them were Malachites, the other probably Double-
collared. All were dead within a month, the one shown being the
longest lived. It appears that they were fed on honey, on which the
then editor remarks that he is by no means convinced that this is the
correct or best food for these birds. Present day knowledge shows
he was right, while another note he makes, " with care it should not
be at all impossible for a skilled aviculturist to bring home several
specimens " may be called prophetic of what Mr. Frost and other
importers were so soon to do.
In December of the same year (1907) another Sunbird
appeared on the bench. This was Mr. Maxwell's " Indian Sunbird,"
an Amethyst-rumped, I believe, and the same exhibitor showed a
Purple Sunbird at the L.C.B.A. Show in November, 1910. Of this
bird Mr. Seth-Smith wrote in his notes on the Show (' Avicultural
Magazine,' 1911, p. 76), "a Sunbird of any species is a unique cage-
bird." It is interesting to compare this remark, so true at the time,
with another more recent one, also in our pages (1915, p. 392), by
another expert, the present editor, " as easy to keep as Sunbirds."
In 1910 " unique," " easy to keep " in 1915. That shows how great
is the gulf between the past and present of Sunbird treatment, though
so narrow in point of time.
On p. 201 of the same volume (1911) Mr. Maxwell gives a
short account of his bird, in the editorial note to which his well-
known success in keeping these delicate birds is referred to. From
this we may presume that between his first in 1907 and the 1910
Purple he had others of which our pages contain no record. I think,
too, that I remember to have seen at least one other on the show-
bench about this time. Of one thing we can be quite certain ; others
were imported, but in most cases in those days of ignorance not to
have a dog's chance of more than a short and miserable existence in
their new homes. Mr. Maxwell tells us the food he used consisted
of Mellin's, Nestle's milk, and fruit, especially Tangerine oranges.
Another query. When was Mellin's first used and by
whom ?

156 Sunbirds in captivity : Past, present and future.
The year 1911 may be said to close the past and commence
the present history of caged Sunbirds, for the latter era under the
new regime introduced- by Mr. Ezra, commenced with the appear-
ance of that enthusiast's first Amethyst-rumped Sunbird at the
L.C.J3.A. Show in December, 1911. This bird appeared again in
absolutely perfect condition at the Crystal Palace in February of the
following year (see ' Avicultural Magazine,' 1912, p. 140) and is still
alive and flourishing to-day, a regular veteran among Sunbirds and a
perfect witness to the success of its treatment.
By 1912 " the present " was in full swing, as is shown by our
1913 volume, to which Mr. Ezra contributed his notes on those in
his possession ; in fact, the whole volume is full of Sunbirds, the
index containing the names of a dozen or more, African as well as
Indian.
Of this "present," so recent and so accessible in our pages,
I will say no more, and as for " the future," that is in the lap
of the gods and therefore needs no words except those of hope.
The failures of the past were the result of want of know-
ledge ; the successes of the present are due to the discovery of the
treatment needed. This Mr. Ezra defines as :
Proper treatment on arrival, cleaning, washing, etc.
Proper food, properly mixed and given.
Absolute cleanliness.
Moderate warmth.
Given these, Sunbirds he considers hardy. At any rate they
thrive and live out their lives in happiness and beauty. Let us hope
that when we once again can return to the pursuits of peace, we may
soon hear of aviary-bred Sunbirds. There has already been promise
in that direction, for Purple Sunbirds have nested at least once in an
aviary, and this year a pair of Amethysts in the Zoo got as far as
hatching a young bird.

By J. Delacour.
1 have already laid before the members of the Avicultural
Society an account of this beautiful Fruit Pigeon, and have long
desired to breed it in an aviary; but I did not expect to succeed,
on account of the difficult habits of this bird, and also on account
of the complete inaptitude for nesting in captivity hitherto shown by
all the Fruit Pigeons.
I am, therefore, particularly happy to he able to announce that
a young " Pigeon Hollandais " has been born and reared at Villers-
Bretonneux this year.
The parents have lived in my collection since the spring of
1914, separated in neighbouring compartments, and have always
shown a profound aversion for one another, as I have previously
related.
This year, at the end of May, it was noticed that the hen was
carrying pieces of straw in her beak, and manifested a good deal of
agitation ; and so I had the idea of opening the door between the
compartments. The two birds straightway approached each other
and were soon united.
Two days afterwards one egg was laid under a shelter in a
basket, where the pigeons had already placed a little dry grass.
This egg was rather large compared with the size of the bird, and
longer than those of doves in general; it was white, with a very
delicate shell. The parents sat most assiduously, after replacing one
another on the nest, but at the end of ten days the egg proved
unfertile.
On June 15th, 1917, the hen laid another egg in a nest placed in
a young fir-tree ; but this was situated in a corner of the aviary nearest
the park, and the constant passing of visitors disturbed the birds,
who abandoned the nest after a few days. I tried to keep the egg
for a more favourable opportunity of incubation, but it very soon
decomposed.
To avoid such another failure, I put the pigeons in a large

aviary (6 m. by 4 m.) planted with thick bushes, in which I placed
several nests. In the early days of August an egg was again laid
in a very small basket, placed higher than all the others, in a witch-
elm.
This nest was left alone for fear of disturbing the birds who
were sitting, and towards August 25th, it was seen that it contained
a young one a few days old, rather similar to those of many
granivorous doves.
For want of sufficient careful observation, lam unable to state
exactly the period of incubation; but I believe it to have been about
eighteen days.
The young one grew rapidly; by September 12th it was
completely covered with feathers and able to hy; it left the nest,
spending the day on the branches of the tree, and slept between
both the parents at night.
The parents fed it on their own customary diet--crushed
potatoes, hemp-seed, and boiled rice, with sweetened milk and
bananas. The latter fruit was unobtainable from September 10th,
and was replaced by pears, but the young pigeon did not suffer from
the effects of them, as I was afraid it might.
During the period of incubation and growth, the weather
was constantly rainy and cool, but a square of " fibro-cement "
placed on the aviary above the nest kept it dry.
Some authors declare that the " Pigeon Hollandais " lays two
eggs per clutch. This may the case in their own country (Seychelles
Islands) ; but it is to be remarked that in this case these birds each
time produced only one egg.
The first plumage of the young one is quite different from that
of the parents. It resembles, generally speaking, that of certain
granivorous young doves, which the young " Pigeon Hollandais "
resembles also in general build, with the exception that the beak is
a little shorter, the feet larger and stronger, and the body stouter.
The head is grey, with a dark-grey crown in the place of the
red crown of the adult bird. There are no caruncles, but there is a
bare place, whose colour is rosy-grey, between the beak and the eye.
Beak rosy-grey, eye brown. Collar grey ; under parts light grey;
ck dull grey, each feather being bordered with light grey ; the

In view of Lieut. Delacour's interesting account of the breed-
ing of the new Pigeon Hollandais [Alectrcenas jpulcherrima ), it seems
opportune to publish a photograph of its namesake, the true Pigeon
Hollandais (A. nitidissima), now unfortunately extinct. Only one of
the three existing specimens is in the United Kingdom, for the bird
supposed to be in the British Museum cannot now be found. The
sole specimen in these islands is in the Royal Scottish Museum at
Edinburgh.
This individual was first recognised by the late Prof. Newton,
on September 2Gth, 1879, when inspecting the bird collection at the
Museum. It had been acquired by the Museum in 1816 as part of
the collection of Dufresne, a dealer in natural history objects, who
afterwards became Aide-Naturalist e at the Paris Museum. By the
kindness of Mr. Eagle Clarke, the writer was enabled on June 4th,
1915, to examine and photograph this rarity. It was still in excellent
condition, and retained well the Dutch colours to which it owed
its name.
Some years previously the writer also examined in the
Museum of the Jardin des Plantes one of the two specimens brought
home by their discoverer, Pierre Sonnerat, in 1781. One of them
seems to have been lost, though Ooenraad Temminck, the first
director of the Leyden Museum, saw both of them in the last
century. They are known, however, to have been at one time
exposed to the fumes of sulphuric acid, and one may have been
thought not worth keeping, and carelessly thrown away, like the
Dodo in the Museum at Oxford. The surviving specimen is care-
fully preserved under a separate glass shade, but the photograph
taken by the writer was not good enough to reproduce here. It was

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
The order in which the patterns and colours of bird plumage
were evolved is a question which has long interested me, and is, I
think, worth considering. It probably explains some of the resem-
blances between allied forms which have been assumed to be mimetic
upon insufficient evidence. Nature works in a very orderly manner
as a rule; and therefore there is every reason to expect related
species to inherit from their common ancestor a tendency to throw
out similar varieties. Should these become fixed by the action of
natural selection, the result would be close resemblance between
two forms (possibly inhabiting widely separated localities), and
which, had they occurred together, would in all likelihood be
assumed to be mimetically assimilated.
I hinted at this point in a short article on the Bed-breasted
Starlings which I published in our Magazine in March, 1908, where
I demonstrated that although Leistes super ciliar is and Trupialis
defilippii, which closely resemble each other in pattern, colouring,
and habits, both occur in the Argentine Bepublic ; L. guianensis
and T. bellicosa, which also are equally alike, do not inhabit the
same regions.
Similar patterns in birds occur in widely different groups.
One of the most frequent divides the colouring of the body into
well-defined areas--head, collar, back, rump, breast, abdomen--the
wings and tail being smoky, with the outer webs coloured like the
back or rump ; or occasionally crossed or terminated by pale bands.
The Gouldian Finch and Chestnut-breasted Finch may be cited as
examples of the first type, the European Chaffinch a slightly modi-

tied form of the second. The Red-collared and Forsten's Lorikeets
nearly approach the first of these types, but have an additional
differently coloured belt across the front of the abdomen. The
colouring of the head is very frequently sharply defined and distinctly
separated from the remaining body pattern ; and, as I shall explain
later, I think this may have been brought about through the reduced
size of the feathers on that part of the body. A sharply defined
breast-belt is another extremely common feature, as also a distinctive
colour on the rump.
As distinct from the above types, which probably owe their
present more or less bright colouring to the agency of sexual selec-
tion, there are very many groups of birds which are somewhat
conspicuously coloured on the under parts, but uniformly brown,
with dark shaft-streaks to the feathers on the upper surface. Now
it is evident that if even the Warblers were coloured above as they
are below, they would run the risk of speedy extermination by pre-
dacious enemies, so that the colouring of their upper parts has
clearly been acquired, or, more likely, retained, for protective
purposes.
The simplest and most prevalent marking in birds is the
shaft-streak, and therefore I think it probable that it was the parent
of all other bird-markings. In its simple form it is fusiform (spindle-
shaped) or hastate (spear-headed), from the latter by an elongation
of the posterior angles it becomes sagittate (arrow-headed); then it
may curve round, forming a sub-marginal or marginal band or border
to the feather; and sometimes when a crescentic border is formed
the shaft-streak vanishes, as though the dark pigment had been used
up in the later development. Take, for instance, White's Thrush as
an example. The fork of a sagittate shaft-streak, if continued to the
outer margin of the wing, would leave a triangular spot of the
original colour in the centre of the border, and this probably
developed the pale terminal spots commonly found on birds' wings.
Now, by modifying the shaft-streak and the crescentic border,
I think almost any pattern to be found on birds may have been
developed. Of course, I am not speaking of secondary sexual char-
acters affecting the form of the feathers, but only of the markings in
more normal plumage. There is no doubt that the narrow parallel

Mr. A. R. Williams,
bands across the breast of the Zebra-finch have originated from
the crescentic borders of an ancestral form, for when crossed with
Bicheno's Finch you recover the crescentic character in the hybrid.
Once more, if the border is continued round the margin of the
feather, the spots characteristic of the Spice-birds and the genera
Amadina, Bathilda, Steganopleura, and many others are produced.
Expansion either of the shaft-streak or the border would
eventually result in a uniformly coloured feather, and it is likely
enough that small and overlapping feathers might attain to this
condition more quickly than larger ones, which may, I think, to
some extent explain why the heads of birds are so frequently
different in colouring from the rest of their bodies. Still, as other
parts, such as the breast, throat, chin, and rump, are also frequently
each of a uniform tint, and we have no evidence that their present
condition took longer to produce than that of the head, we can only
guess at the reason.

(Continued from p. ISO).
The Green Plover or Lapwing might be called the character-
istic bird of this district. The word " pee-wit " is totally inadequate
as an imitation of its cry, which has a shrill, penetrating, piercing,
yet melancholy and drawn-out half-whistling quality, difficult to
describe and almost impossible to imitate. When Plovers sleep is a
problem, for their cries may be heard at all times of the day and
night. They are not at all shy birds here ; one can get quite close
to them, near enough to examine the details of form and colouring.
They give beauty and liveliness to the countryside which would be
much missed were they to depart. As regards habitat they are
almost everywhere. The water-meadows are never without Lap-
wings. They resort to the ploughed fields, to sheep-walks, to
pastures, to manured land, to the deeply rutted cart-tracks, and to
the banks of pools and streams. They never enter gardens or farm-
yards, and keep away from the copses. They are most fascinating

birds to watch. In winter the back loses its lustre, dulls, and goes
olive-brown. During February the gradual burnishing and enriching
of the plumage is very noticeable. The mantle daily gets greener
and glossier. At the same time a red tinge develops under the tail.
Water-hens live in and about the river, where trees and a
hedge overhang the water, quite close to the farm and some cottages.
They may be seen at any time of the day walking about the meadows,
and if alarmed will run swiftly to the water and swim to cover.
Their movements are remarkably quick. There is a scurry of dark
bodies across the turf, converging lines of ripples ending in black
patches, a fleck of white from the under-feathers of the jerked-up
tail, then silence, and no signs of life anywhere along the river.
Wild Ducks are occasional winter visitors to the river, usually
at night, but do not stay for any period, generally gone by next
morning. Apparently they make it a resting-place on a journey.
Immediately below the dairy a stream debouches swiftly into
the river under a low-arched footbridge. Nearly every day during
winter a Jack-snipe flew out from under the bridge when anyone
passed over. The flight is rapid, only a general brown coloration is
distinguishable, but the erratic zig-zag rolling mode of progression
is unmistakable. Snipe are scarce about this valley.
On November 9th, 1916, a Swan flew over, travelling steadily
towards the south-west.
In the end of autumn and during early winter flocks of Wild
Geese went over, going in southerly and westerly directions. In
February flocks were seen going the opposite way. The groups
varied in number from six to twenty. It would seem as if they left
their breeding haunts in Eastern England and spent the winter in
the south and west of the country, returning at the coming of mild
weather. The symmetry of a wedge-shaped flock was admirable.
The leader kept steadily on, and the V-formed following never broke
up. The wedge varied in the space between the two lines, and in
length. The tail inclined to right or left as they swept round in a
great curve, one side rose higher than the other, and for a moment
we caught sight of snow-white under wings, then they resumed a
straight course. At their nearest we could hear the rush of powerful
pinions through the air, a deep drumming note produced by the

passage of stiff quills impelled at great speed by strong muscles.
The speed, vigour, and energy of such great heavy birds are alike
extraordinary. There was considerable individual freedom of move-
ment in the flock, but never enough to spoil the wedge, which
formation was preserved all the time they were under observation.
The presence of Hawks was reported on three occasions
through the winter. Each was a Kestrel or Wind-hover. One was
seen flying over a forty-acre field of young rye, not above a yard
from the ground, wings stretched and taut, gliding along as if on an
invisible wire. One was observed at close quarters to swoop and
rise carrying a mouse from the corner of a field near a rick. The
third was being pursued by a noisy mob of various small birds.
The Hawk drew itself up through some high elm trees, where the
majority of assailants stopped and perched and chattered clamor-
ously, whilst the Kestrel soared away beyond and above the trees,
followed by a few stragglers that were rapidly outdistanced and
abandoned the chase.
Pheasants abounded in the autumn, but were less conspicuous
later, though little shooting took place. The Pheasant is a beautiful
addition to the landscape. Its bright colouring, especially in the
cock bird, blends well with English scenery, being particularly in
harmony with the changing ripening tints of the fall. Its speedy
and easy running, its vigorous bursts of flying, its many habits
peculiar to itself, as " rocketing," add to the interest one feels in the
Pheasant as a purely wild bird apart from its "sporting" connec-
tions, for it is one of the largest and most distinctive of British
birds.
Coveys of Partridges roost in the stubbles on mild nights, run
quickly when disturbed, and fly with rapid pulsing flight near the
ground, reminding one curiously of Sparrows. They seek more
shelter as the weather gets harder.
The stridulous screech of the Barn or White Owl was heard
most nights, and the hooting " too-hoo " of the Tawny or Wood Owl
less often. Owls should be valuable birds in Mid-Dorset, for it is a
considerable corn-growing country, and rats and mice abound, as
well as Sparrows and other small birds, besides beetles and a great
variety of insects.

Larks apparently make little change in their habits with the
seasons, for at all times, even winter, they start up from the ground,
both in grass and stubble, and fly away to drop in some other open
space. A genial sunny day in February will send them soaring
skywards and singing as if it were spring or early summer.
Tits, though not conspicuously numerous, are generally dis-
tributed. The Blue Tit, commonly called Tomtit, is the most often
seen ; Long-tailed and Great Tits also accur.
The approach of spring foreshadows itself upon the birds.
By the end of February Larks, Thrushes, and Robins sing ; a brighter
green glosses the mantle of the Plover, and the Goldfinch promises
to be gorgeous. All plumage brightens, " the little brothers of
St. Francis" show markedly increased liveliness and activity. Rooks
begin foraging for sticks, gathering round the old nesting trees and
cawing loudly. The period of nidification will soon be upon them,
and the birds undergo striking alterations of plumage and behaviour,
outward changes indicating physiological ones.

book will wish for more from Miss Lorimer's pen. The book is well
written and liberally illustrated, and a map at the end of the volume

In these pages one finds the thrilling romance of Africa in a
gorgeous setting. The writer has well said that the Dark Continent
is really a blaze of amazing light (p. 7). We pass from the bright-
hued fishes of the coral reefs to the wonderful life of East Africa--
Mombasa, Nairobi, Port Florence, all linked by the Uganda railway ;
the game-haunted wildernesses, crawling with tall giraffe and sturdy
buffalo, painted zebra and grotesque wildebeest; the great Victoria

Review.
Uganda, smothered in showers of butterflies; the crater lakes of
Toro and the fantastic nightmare flora of the Giant's Garden.
Many of the illustrations are so good that one wishes they
could have been reproduced in colour. For instance, we note the
pretty camp scene facing p. 40 [one can readily call up the vivid
enamel blue sky, the brilliant crude green vegetation, and the heavv
scent of the parasol-topped acacias] ; Lake Victoria and its tiny
fishing fleet, swimming in a heat-haze ; the native potter with his
wares and the background of tall, frayed banana trees ; caravan
porters crossing a swamp, each with his load stepping through the
papyrus, a typical African scene ; the still, burnished crater lake,
asleep in the sunshine ; and the grim gigantic flora overlooking a
blue valley in the Mountains of the Moon.
To the aviculturist the various bird paragraphs will appeal
strongly. Thus on p. 49 the writer says :
" From the points of the palm-leaves myriads of weaver-birds
nests hung, like beautiful pendulous fruit. I wish you could have
seen them ; I think there is nothing so picturesque or fascinating
in nature as bird-life. There were hundreds of them. Brown and
round, with tiny openings for front doors, they hung suspended in
the lightest fashion from every conceivable tip and point of the
jagged leaves of a swaying palm-tree, whose leaves did not only grow
in the mop-broom fashion at the top of the tree, but spread out from
it all the way dowm. Moving lightly in the breeze, they looked like
unlit Chinese lanterns on a tree decorated for one of the fetes which
Arabs love. The birds themselves, in the sunlight, looked as bright
as yellow canaries, and they darted in and out of their nests like
bees seeking honey."
On p. 50 :
" There is a brilliantly-coloured bird called the bee-eater,
which has amusing habits. I saw hundreds of them in the Rift
Valley when I was on the railway. They sit on the branches of
trees, and pounce down upon wasps, bees, flies, and all sorts of
insects, when they are flying through the air. It is a pretty sight
to watch them. Their tails are very long and pointed, because the
three central feathers stick out far beyond the others. One of their
favourite occupations is riding on the back of a bustard, and very

funny they look in their brilliant plumage seated on the backs of
their dignified steeds, which never shake them off or bother them-
selves about them. From the back of the bustard they keep a sharp
look-out for insects and flies, and when they spy one they dart after
it, and having devoured it, fly back again to the bustard's back. I
have often seen them riding on the backs of goats and antelopes as
well as of bustards."*
On p. 51 she says of the Sun-birds :
" I used to see hundreds of these brilliant creatures darting
about in the dazzling light, or hanging on to the bright yellow
trumpet flowers which grow in clusters on a shrub in most of the
gardens in Parkland. They are very like humming birds, and
amazingly metallic in colouring. They never stay still, because,
unlike the humming birds, they can't poise themselves in the air.
I used to watch them pecking with their long, black pointed bills at
the ends of the flowers, quite close to the stems, to tap their honey,
as the trumpets were too long for them to get their beaks down to
the treasure trove."
The book contains some zoological errors. Aviculturally, we
may note that there are no Humming-birds in Africa, though on
p. 94 such is asserted ; in general zoology, Haartbeest should be
spelt " Hartebeest " (p. 44); i. e. " Stag-Ox," from the Dutch
" Hart " = Stag, not " Haart " = Hard. The Springbok is unknown
in East Africa ; the animal mentioned on p. 146 was probably a
Gazelle. On p. 113 the authoress states that no one has ever heard
of African elephants being tamed. This is unfortunate, as we have
before us a photograph of the troop of tame African elephants at the
Belgian post of Api. The photograph of the King of Uganda is not
a good likeness of His Highness as we remember him.
These errors will no doubt be corrected in some future edition.
This is everybody's book. G. R.

OUR ILLUSTRATIONS.
On taking office the present Editor found the Society in
possession of an extensive series of bird photographs, which had
been acquired under the able management of Mr. Astley. This
collection has since received several important accessions, and is
still growing; in fact, as we write we have news of yet more
photographs on their way. Nearly all are up to Avicultural
standard, and we have been enabled to publish several of high
educational value. Our Magazine, in fact, is second to none in the
excellence of its illustrations and the value of its letterpress. Our
many contributors the world over have seen to this.
The Editor therefore asks for more warmth to hatch the
Avicultural egg -- for further donations, in fact, for the Illustration
Fund. He is grateful for the support he has received in conducting
the Magazine; now he would ask for power to extend its scope and
usefulness. The increased cost of reproduction holds up the issue
of many an excellent bird study. We have the pictures, but no
gallery in which to display them.
Donations should be sent direct to the Publishers and not to
the Editor.

Mr. C. H. Lienau writes: With our small population scattered over such a
vast area of country we cannot form the societies and clubs which bird-lovers in the
old country and on the Continent are able to, and consequently when one has to
work along practically alone, that incentive to higher things is not so keen as when
there is a feeling of friendly rivalry.
From my earliest days I have been a very keen lover of all animal and bird
life, and I cannot remember the time when we did not have a varied assortment of
pets of all kinds.
About two years ago I saw the ' Avicultural Magazine ' mentioned in a book
on birds that I was reading. Feeling sure that it would be of interest to me I asked
my bookseller to order it for me, and about three months later my first copy came
to hand. I was simply charmed with it, and have read with the greatest interest
all the articles which have appeared in it and the subsequent numbers which I
have received.

Dear Sir, -- 1 have a stuffed Starling which was shot during that very hot
summer a few years back. There was a nest near where I lived in this neighbour-
hood, and the noise of the birds was supposed to disturb a child living in the house
where they had built. So both the old birds were shot, and I secured the male. I
presume his mate was purported to be spoilt for stuffing. I am coming to my
point. The bird I have appears, judging to-night by lamp-light, to be practically a
solid glossy green on the head and neck, and very little in the way of spots at all
on him. I reared, I presume, the whole of the nestlings. They had practically no
down, nor hardly a sign of feathers. There was another young bird added to them,
which was said to have been taken away from the nest -- whether fallen out or not
I will not say. That bird gave me some trouble, and by the way the others acted I
think it was the one that escaped. The other four I reared to fend for themselves.
Two died before changing the nest feathers completely, one escaped from a
neighbour, the other I kept for some years until it died.
What I am leading up to is this : I have both birds -- the male parent, I
presume, and the offspring I reared (which the stuffer told me was a male). I see
no reason to doubt his veracity. The younger bird is very unlike his father ; he is
profusely spotted, and has been twice to a show, and I did not hear that he was
described as unusual. He was never at any time like his presumed father. He
looks in splendid condition and very glossy. J. Weir.

Dear Sir,-- There is not a single Goldcrest alive here, and hardly such a
thing as a Long-tailed Tit. It is very rarely that I see any Long-tailed Tits, and if
I do it is just two or three odd birds, probably all cocks or all hens ; the ordinary
Hocks of ten or more are a thing of the past. No Fieldfares or Redwings ; even
Greenfinches were killed off last winter The only birds in this neighbourhood that
one can say are fairly often met with are Bullfinches, Sparrows, and Starlings, a
few Missel-Thrushes. Blackbirds, and Song-Thrushes. The common Meadow Pipit
is seldom seen now. The summer migrants will be more plentiful when the season
arrives than our non-migratory or resident species. Since this awful war started
there seems to be, as it were, a force at work which slaughters nearly everything :
human beings are being killed, animals are being killed down more than uSual to
supply food, the elements have been at work, intense cold has killed off bird life to
a terrible extent, trees have been slaughtered with the axe, the pretty woods having
been cleared and thinned unmercifully. What times we are living in !
Yours truly,
P. F.'M. Galloway.

Mr. J. Weir writes : At the present time I have two hen (?) Blackbirds.
They are the same season's birds, and I have had them some years. They differ
somewhat : one is a big bird -- might pass for a fair-sized cock of a different
colouring; the other is slimmer. The bigger bird is almost a chocolate-brown, and
slightly grey on the throat ; the other is a lighter colour, and rather prettily
mottled in the same place ; the darker bird also has a slight suggestion of an eye-
mark like a thrush. I had two other hen Blackbirds, one slightly pied, which
resembled the lighter bird on the throat, one (not the pied one) rather pretty. I
think it is a pity hen Blackbirds, Sparrows, etc., are not shown at the big shows.

ANCESTRAL CHARACTERS IN NESTLINGS.

<bodyText confidence="0.89870525" page_id="32704479"  page_num="171" year="" vol="">
Dear I)r. Renshaw, -- Re my article on the feather-patterns of birds, I have
now gone a little further and put together a few notes on " Ancestral Characters in
Nestlings.&amp;quot; Whilst writing these out, it occurred to me to wonder whether the
idea had crossed Darwin&apos;s mind when writing his ' Descent of Man,' and I was
pleased to discover that it had done so.
Herewith I enclose my .article on " ancestral characters." I don't know
whether any of the views expressed therein are new, but, as I have not myself met
with them in print, I concluded that they might at least be new to some of our
members. Nature generally leaves " footprints in the sands of time " by which one
may follow out her methods; and, with a little study, it is fairly easy to trace the
development of the patterns found both in birds and many Lepulopterous insects.
The photograph of the Wood Swallows is very attractive, and all illustrations
render an article more pleasing. With the material which you possess I think you
have already done wonders in the way of illustration.
Yours very sincerely,
The Lilies, Arthur G. Butler.
124, Beckenham Road,
Beckenham, Kent;
January 20th, 1918.
[We hope to shortly publish Dr. Butler's paper in illustrated form. The
photograph above referred to represents a pair of Wood Swallows and their young,
and is the careful work of our contributors, Messrs. R. T. Littlejohns and S. A.
Lawrence. It will be remembered that their beautiful study of a sitting Wood
Swallow appeared in our Anzac number.---G. R.]

ABNORMAL RACQUETS IN A MOTMOT.

Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- It is curious that my Motinot, which is in splendid
condition and health, has not acquired his racquets this year : that is to say, the
barbs have not fallen off the shaft of the two central tail-feathers.
They are like this--
instead of this --
Tail feathers of the Motmot.
I wonder why the tail is longer, if anything, than last year, 191o.
There are two of these feathers in the tail. Usually the racquets appeared a
month after the moult was fully completed--in November.
The January Magazine was very interesting I thought.
Believe me,
l T ours very truly,

A member's correspondent writes from Sydney : The trouble is, we are going
to run out of canary seed ; there is only a few months' supply here. The trouble
will be, no one will buy birds. Already the bird shops are besieged with folks
trying to sell their stocks of common birds on account of the high price of seed-
There is a little seed grown in Queensland, but that will not be ready for harvesting
before Christmas. All our canary seed comes from England, and as it cannot be
imported into England it cannot come out here.
THE PIGEON HOLLANDAIS AS PIGEON FRANCAI8.
Lieut. Delacotjr, in the ' Bulletin of the Socidte d'Acclimatation de France '
for November last, remarks of the new Pigeon Hollandais (Alectrcenas pulcherrima ),
" If it had not already too many names, I should be tempted to call it the 'Pigeon
Frantjais,' for it also reproduces, in darker hue, our national colours."
The true Pigeon Hollandais (A. nitidissima) now extinct, appears to have
similarly impressed the old-time naturalists; for the late Prof. Newton has stated
that the specimen in the Edinburgh Museum, figured in this issue, was labelled
"The Hackled Pigeon (Ptilinopus nitidissimus), Scop. Sp. locality, Isle of France,
Columba Francice Dufresne." On the bottom of the stand was written, " R -d
Hackled Pigeon, 219, Columba Framyia, Linn." The name may, however, refer
to its habitat. Graham Renshaw.

OSTRICHES,
By J. K. Butter, M.D.
The Ostrich is by far the largest and most powerful of all
living fowl, Northern, Central, and Southern Africa being the home
of this most striking and handsome bird. There are at least two
species of Ostrich generally found in the Africau Continent, the
Sudanese and the Somali Ostrich. The latter bird has a bluish hue on
the neck and reddish legs, in the former the neck and legs are of a
whitish-grey colour. The Ostrich has its toes reduced to two ; the
outer one is much the smaller. The cock bird is much taller than the
hen, standing well over 8 ft. high, and when running at speed cover-
ing 25 ft. at a stride. You get another form in South America, the
Rhea, and the Emu in Australia. I have had the pleasure of keeping
all the three kinds together. You also get the Cassowary in Ceram
and New Guinea, a most striking bird, with a horny helmet and a
brilliantly coloured neck. The Ostrich, Rhea, Emu, and Cassowary
are all flightless birds. My Ostriches were all Sudanese. The adult
cock that I possessed had black feathers covering his body, except
the upper parts of the thighs, which were almost devoid of any
covering. His neck and legs were of a whitish-grey colour and
almost naked, including the thighs. His wing and tail feathers were
large and beautiful, and all of them were white. His name was
Napoleon ; he was mated to an adult hen of the name of Minnehaha.
She was not so tall as her consort, and she had feathers of a beautiful

Dr. J. K. Butter,
greyish-brown, her tail and wing feathers being white, but not so
large or full as in the cock. They were very quiet and well behaved,
and could be approached and handled with impunity. (Always
approach these birds from behind or sideways, as they kick forwards
and downwards.) They would allow strangers to walk about them,
their pet aversion being dogs, although they got used to mine, an
Airedale. If a dog got into the field where they were they would go
after him at once, and try to run him down and strike at him. An
ostrich is a very dangerous bird when he likes, they can kick forwards
with terrible effect, enough to break a man's thigh and make a nasty
wound with their powerful and strongly-made nails. It is said the
thump will break a rib or back-bone of any ordinary animal.
Essentially inhabitants of open sandy country, mine did wonderfully
well on the grassfield at Cannock, with a large and dry shed, and
plenty of bedding to lie on. I had the adult cock and hen and four
smaller hens half-grown. They drank enormous quantities of water
at times, and I fed them on dog biscuits broken up, and plenty of
maize or Indian corn. They grazed in the field all day long, and
children fed them with bread very often when passing the field to
school. I could bring them from any part of the field whenever
they saw Indian corn, of which they were extremely fond, as I
mentioned before. When first let out in the morning they would
run round the field several times, and then start a sort of waltzing
or pirouetting round and round, often for many minutes together.
They were very inquisitive birds, exploring any new thing that they
saw, and always attempting to swallow the object. One of my hens
died, and at the post-viortem examination I found a crockery hen's
nest egg, a 3 in. bolt with nut on, several nails, and pieces of glass,
which had been swallowed and had caused her death. If one was
doing anything in the field with nails or bolts and screws, one
always had to keep them out of sight or they would swallow the lot.
I well remember a patient of mine who had consulted me that same
morning about a very large boil on the back of his neck ! I advised
him to let me open it, but he decided to wait for a day or two. As
* In Paul J. Bainey's film, " The African Hunt," exhibited in this country in
1913, there was an amusing picture of a whole troop of Ostriches waltzing
round and round as described by Dr. Butter.--G. Ii.

I was going to feed the Ostriches he accompanied me into the field.
The adult hen spotted his boil, as the poultice had slipped off it.
She had one good snap at it. I heard a terrible yell, and on inves-
tigation I found that the boil had disappeared, saving me the trouble
of using the knife when he came again to consult me. The adult
Ostriches are capable of making a loud, booming sound, but the
young birds are mute. They are polygamous, several hens laying
in the one nest. In their native land the cock and hen birds brood
alternately. In this country they are easily hatched in a Hearson's
incubator. The eggs, weight 3 to lb., are creamy-white and
deeply pitted. My birds laid every other day, anywhere in the field,
and as soon as the egg was laid went away and left it. My hen laid
eighteen to twenty in a season. They generally hatch in from five
to six weeks. Ostriches are extremely fond of a grass that is called
"lucerne," and which I had my field planted or sown with. I
hatched four young birds out of nine eggs, although there were chicks
in all the eggs. I fed my chicks on coarse chicken meal (scalded),
ground meat crissel (scalded), cardiac powder (Spratt's), about two
teaspoonfuls to twelve chicks, increasing the quantity as they grew
older. Mix well together, and dry out to a crumbly state with
barley-meal, chopped lettuce, and any insect food, such as clean
gentles, dried flies, or ants' eggs.
Ostriches suffer from parasites and intestinal worms. I used
to give them the following mixture:
Sulphur, 1|- lb.
Salt, i lb.
Sulphate of iron, \ lb.
Arsenic, f oz.
Grind all to a powder, and mix well; keep in a box perfectly
dry. If wire-worm is present add \ oz. of copper sulphate.
Dose.
Adult birds, one tablespoonful for each bird.
Young birds, six to twelve months old, # tablespoonful daily
for each bird.
Chicks less than six months old f tablespoonful daily for each
chick. If birds will not take this powder put it into an orange. I

used to put it in a thin paper bag and force it gently down the
gullet, taking care to avoid injuring the windpipe.
I gave this treatment daily for six days--one dose daily or
half dose night and morning. The treatment may be repeated after
an interval of two weeks. A good way to give the birds this powder
is to take an orange, and scoop some of the inside of the orange out,
putting the powder in the cavity, and taking care that each bird gets
only one orange. The powder acts as a tonic and stimulant to the
feather growth, and also helps to get rid of tape-worm, wire-worm,
and mites.

THE SCOTTISH ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

natural to the beast."-- Peacham.
These quaint words, written so long ago, have been translated
into fact by the Zoological Society of Scotland, if instead of " draw "
we write " exhibit," and instead of " emblem " we write " Zoo."
Not only has this work been done, but it has been well done, and it
was with the greatest pleasure that we noted on our visit some time
ago that the fine collection which has been got together at Corstor-
phine is at least half-way " back to Nature." The magnificent old
timber, the furze-topped ridges and sheltered valleys constitute
the Park an ideal place for the proper exhibition of birds; there
are ample ponds and enclosures and excellent flight aviaries and
paddocks.
At the time of our visit by far the most interesting bird
exhibit was the group of three King Penguins, which has been
brought from South Georgia. These were shown in a specially
constructed enclosure, formed of shelving rock and planted with
clumps of coarse grass, and provided with a deep pool for diving.

The Penguins stood solemnly bolt upright, like so many tall jars ;
suddenly a desire for exercise overcame their dignity, and they
slowly waddled one after the other for a few yards before settling to
rest again. In the pool they were very active, swimming almost
abreast as if to drive landwards a shoal of fish.
The Water-fowl pond contained some interesting foreign
Ducks and Geese--Mandarin and Summer Ducks, Cereopsis,
Chinese, and Egyptian Geese, and so on. The pool was prettily
planted with irises and well backed with bushes. The Cranes'
enclosure contained the Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes, also
European and South American Flamingoes, an Australian Pelican,
and several Gannets.
The garden near the manor-house contains a fine Parrot
aviary 80 ft. long, inhabited by various showy and large species--
Macaws and Cockatoos ; here also is a lesser aviary for smaller
Psittacines, such as Budgerigars and Love-birds. Then there is a
mixed series of foreign Finches, which are kept all the year round
without artificial heat. North of the mansion-house is the Plovers'
aviary, a pretty installation with a pool fringed with heather ; in
this part of the park the shore birds are kept--Terns, Oyster-
catchers, Dunlin, and the like. The Pheasants are housed in roomy
shrubberies, and the series includes the Amherst, Golden, and
Eeeve's species; there is also a paddock devoted to Rheas, two of
these latter being quite white. We also noticed an Emu, said to
belong to the spotted " species." We must confess, however, that
we could detect nothing in the bird to justify separation from the
common form.
We strongly recommend all aviculturists to visit the Scottish
Zoological Park. Though only opened in July, 1913, this Cinderella
of Zoos is an institution of the very first rank, and a highly valuable
asset to the people of Edinburgh. On all three sides--educational,
spectacular, and scientific--it compels the highest praise ; and it
will probably remain without a rival among the zoological activities
of the North.

It is now many years since the large Plying Aviary was com-
pleted at the Dublin Zoological Gardens. It was my privilege just
at that time to have been elected a member of the Council : we all
assembled after the breakfast that fine morning to consult what the
feathered inhabitants should be. There was much diversity of
opinion--some suggested Hawks, others Doves, some Waders, and
others said why not have all together ? It was a lovely spring
morning, and we were all filled with enthusiasm, which is only to
be felt in the very soul of an ornithologist. Lists of bird dealers
were searched and orders were issued, thus: so many Virginian
Cardinals, so many Pope Cardinals, so many hundred Saffron
Pinches; it was a large place and required a great many birds to
make a big show, two were generally visible at a time out of many
dozens. Well, between purchases and presents in a short time a
very fine collection was formed, there were some really good speci-
mens, including many rara, aves. I think a pair of Hunting Cissas
are a memory never to be forgotten, with their graceful flight and
wanton ways ; but I fear they took toll of many of the smaller
inhabitants. There were also two Peruvian Jays, beautiful birds,
but very delicate, which were cut off by the first frosts ; it was truly
the struggle for life and survival of the fittest in this large open-air
structure. Two quiet Pruit Pigeons, black with red heads, survived
a much longer time ; I think they hailed from the Pacific Islands.
Glossy Starlings lived well and kept in the pink of perfection. There
were a glorious pair of the wedge-tailed Glossy Starlings, birds that
are good company to all, even to the smallest, very unlike their
cousin the vicious long-tailed Glossy Starling, which, with the
exception of the Indian Koel, is the most pugnacious of birds. I
know I had two Male Koels at one time, which I had purchased from
a dealer for a mere song. I expect he was glad to get rid of them,
so was I, as the banana bill was too high. I (like many others of my
fellow-aviculturists, I fear) when properly fed up with birds, give
them to the Zoo ! I remember speaking to one of the keepers in

the London Garden on the ferocity of a superb Himalayan Ground
Thrush. " Oh, he is a devil, sir. (I suppose that's the reason we
got im).' Personally, when I kept birds, I found Zoos useful
establishments ; it lessened my liabilities--battle, murder, and sudden
death. Such is the weakness of human nature.
Waders were a great success in this big aviary. It was a
glorious sight to see a couple of dozen Ruffs all in full breeding
plumage, dancing and sparring and fighting just like a Donnybrook
fair, here and there a stately Curlew and an Oyster Catcher looking
so trim and so sleek. Dozens of Weavers' nests hung from a large
thorn-tree, whilst one bird was building the other was pulling he
structure to pieces to make its own nest with ; they were chiefly the
Red-billed, with a few Napoleons and Orange Bishops. Saffron
finches were the only birds that bred freely; there were some
gorgeous old cocks, and a few extra lovely specimens such as you
find in the wild Yellow-Hammer.
Singers there were none, but a Canadian Fox Sparrow had a
few sweet notes that could be heard from one side of the Gardens to
the other. The Fox Sparrow had a chum, a Canadian Butcher Bird,
which resembles the smallest of our Grey Shrikes; these were
captured at sea by an enthusiastic ornithological doctor on one of
the Allan Line steamers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence ; they both
lived to be very old inhabitants. There was also a Canadian Red-
pole caught in the same manner. It was much the same as our
own birds, and is a plentiful winter migrant to British North
America ; it became a chum of the Irish crowd, although it never
wore a shamrock on St. Patrick's Day. Two large Bustards were a
great acquisition ; these were presented by a wealthy wine merchant,
who had large estates in Oporto ; they flourished as long as live insects
were to be got, but failed when the store was exhausted. It is
strange that a grain-feeding bird like the Bustard requires live food,
which it is accustomed to pick up on the Spanish plains--locusts,
and possibly beetles, and the cockroach tribe. The male bird is quite
half as big again as the female, and struts around like a Turkey
Cock; these birds require a good dry climate. Another nice meek
bird was the Tinamou, I think the Lesser Tinamou; he, poor bird !
did nothing and interfered with nobody, which was about his chief

recommendation. At times a homely brown Corncrake peeped out,
but was a bit inclined to be a recluse ; he seemed to think it was the
best policy to stick in the bushes. At first the whole aviary was in
one structure down a sloping hill, terminating at the lake, which was
taken in to the extent of a few feet ; this was a very nice idea, but, alas 1
proved disastrous, as the birds when alarmed flew down with great
violence, struck the wire netting, and perished in the water. Each
morning the keeper had to go round and fish out the corpses ; after
that the structure was altered and divided, and the lake portion cut
off. In this section a dozen Greater Black-backed Gulls were placed
--" foul vultures of the deep " ; these were got from a famous breeding-
ground on an island on the Mayo Coast, and what's more, were Sinn
Feiners (translated means "all for ourselves"). Ducks and Teal
were placed in the same compartment, but disappeared one by one
as they swallowed them.
The quiet Heron feeds along this part of the lake in a wild
state, and catches eels by stealth. In spring Wild Pochards and
Tufted Ducks assemble on the lake in large flocks, and the Canadian
Brent Geese assemble sometimes in fifties; they are fully acclima-
tised, and breed on the Viceregal pond, as well as on other lakes in
the Phoenix Park. A keeper tells a curious story of a Wild Swan
(a Bewick) which lit on the lake, and was set upon by some of the
other tame water fowl so vigorously that it became exhausted ; he
captured and pinioned it, and I think it is there still.
Now darkness is coming on, and my memory is fading like the
light, so I must close with a line from our national poet :
" Fond memory brings the light of other days around me."

{Concluded from p. 162.)
If we accept the view that shaft-streaks represent the earliest
type of avian marking, the Larks and typical Thrushes would appear
to have changed their character less than most other birds, their
colouring being protective, the hens also having probably chosen their
mates for valour rather than for superior beauty of form or colouring.

My suggestion that the development of shaft-streaks accounts
for diversified pattern is not based upon unsupported evidence, since
I noted it in observations on the change of colour in Pyromelana
franciscana (see ' Ibis,' 1897, p. 361), carefully keeping watch on
particular groups of feathers day by day. I also saw the same form
of expansion in the colouring slowly developed in the assumption
of the adult colouring by Paroaria capitata, an account of which
was published in the ' Proc. Zool. Soc.' for 1904, pp. 350-351. I
believe that I have also recorded elsewhere similar facts respecting
the spring growth of colour in the throat-patch of the Grey Wagtail
which I kept caged at the time.
When a dark shaft-streak is divided by a light feather-shaft
it may give rise to the twin-spots which occur in some bird-
plumages, as in Polyplectron (see Darwin's 1 Descent of Man,'
second edition, p. 659). Still, on all these points we want more
evidence, and that can best be obtained by interbreeding and close
observation.
I have mentioned the Zebra-finch x Bicheno hybrid as indi-
cating the development of a transversely banded breast from the
crescentic outer borders of the feathers in a common ancestor ; and
in my article on hybrid Ploceidce (' Avic. Mag.,' new series, vol. iv.,
pp. 345-354) I have pointed out the interesting facts which may
be discovered by crossing two species not nearly related. Recently,
while again reading Darwin's ' Descent of Man,' I came across a
passage which favours the same view. He says : " The constitu-
tional disturbance in the offspring, caused by a cross between two
distinct species or races, often leads to the reappearance of long-lost
characters." Well, among other things I concluded that, as neither
the Zebra-finch nor the Diamond-finch had the remarkable crimson
breast shown by the hybrid depicted on my plate, the ancestor of
these birds must have had crimson on the breast, which had even
been retained in the Painted-finch ( Emblema picta), a relative of the
Diamond-finch ; and I was agreeably surprised later by the discovery,
in an example of the latter which died in one of my aviaries, of
rose-red fringes to several of the breast-feathers, indicating a partial
reversion to this ancestral colouring.
This brings me to the practical object of the present article:

Dr. Arthur G. Butler.
I want some of our younger and more enthusiastic members to put
up pairs of species which are not nearly related, and to try to
produce hybrids from them. I feel sure that the results obtained
will be of considerable interest. Closely related species, as a rule,
produce merely intermediate plumage, without any reversion to
ancestral characters. When hybrids from closely related species prove
fertile, they sometimes revert in their offspring to the characters of one
of the parents. Of course, personal experience led me to the con-
clusion that this kind of breeding was not easy, but then my aviaries
were certainly unsuitable for work of the kind; and now that my
rather unsatisfactory outdoor aviaries have ceased to exist, and
advancing age and limited means render it impossible for me to
attempt work of the kind, I hope those who are younger, and who
possess spacious outdoor aviaries planted with bushes and creepers,
will not neglect this fascinating branch of research.
Of course, in recommending the mating of unrelated birds, I
do not suggest intercrossing distinct families ; and, as regards sub-
families, common-sense should decide. Greenfinches were placed by
the late Dr. Sharpe in the sub-family Coccothraustince ; the Canaries,
Goldfinches, and others in the sub-family Fringillince ; but the ease
with which Greenfinches can be crossed with various Fringilline
birds, and the perfectly intermediate character of the hybrids, throw
considerable doubt upon the importance of the distinctions upon
which these sub-families are separated.
As regards the development of colours in birds, assuming
that originally they were either black or brown and white, I should
say (judging from my many years' study of Lepidopterous insects)
that the passage from one bright colour to another follows very
much the order observable in the rainbow. Without question the
first development from white is yellow, and from black usually, if
not invariably, blue ; from brown probably purple. From yellow arise
orange, then vermilion, crimson, purple, blue, green ; from blue the
order is, I think, generally reversed, and from purple either blue or
crimson may emerge.
Blue often appears at first as a gloss on a black surface, but one
sometimes notices, in close proximity to this shot colouring, patches
of pigmented blue, as also where dark brown is shot with purple,

violet or lilac markings frequently appear in contiguity therewith.
In birds crimson is commonly found in juxtaposition to black, or
even (as in the Gouldian-finch) taking the place of black ; but, as black
represents a combination of all colours, there seems no reason
why it should be restricted in its development, as white must
needs be.
White is the absence of all colour, and the first step it takes
towards colour-development is to yellow.* In at least one moth which
passed through my hands in my old Museum days, there were both
pure white and bright yellow individuals; and in some of the butter-
flies of the genus Terias the males are yellow but the females pure
white, indicating that the brighter hue was due to sexual selection,
or, less probably, to superior vigour in the male sex; since white,
unless acquired for protective purpose, is generally an indication of
constitutional weakness.
Well, in all these matters we are profoundly ignorant; we
need ever more and more evidence. As dear old Darwin used
to say, when some useful new fact was brought to his notice :
" God bless my soul, how little we know ! " That must continue
true of mortal man, but we ought always to be growing in know-
ledge ; it is the chief object of all study; therefore I hope some
of our members will do their best to let in the light upon the origin
of bird patterns.
[In connection with Dr. Butler's remarks on colour patterns,
we may mention the poecilomeres, or colour areas, which have been
mapped out by Messrs. Dewar and Finn. These occur on the
chin, malar area, upper jaw, a small patch above and slightly in
front of the eye, and another below and slightly behind the orbit.
Other poecilomeres are the ear, crown of the head, and occiput; on
the body they are found on the fore-end of the sternum, vent, and
rump ; they also occur above and below the shoulders, and on the

By D. Le Souef, C.M.Z.S., the Director.
Australian Honey-eaters are comparatively easy to keep in
captivity provided that they have suitable food, and we find them
quite hardy in our large flight aviary (50 ft. x 25 ft. x 30 ft. high).
Despite the number of birds in it (about 100), both the White-naped
Honey-eater (Melithreptus lunulatus) and White-plumed Honey-
eater ( Ptilotis penicillata ) bred last year and reared their young.
As is well known, many birds, especially Finches, have, when in
aviaries, a habit of pulling other birds' nests to pieces and building
their own with the material stolen, but with Honey-eaters this does
not seem to occur often. In the same aviary the Pied Grallina
(Grallina picata) also builds its mud nest, and successfully rears its
young.
In the young White-naped Honey-eater the top of the head
is green, and it is some months before it gradually becomes black,
but the young White-plumed Honey-eaters are practically like their
parents when fully feathered. It is interesting to note how much
longer some birds take than others to assume the fully adult plumage.
We know little about this matter, mostly on account of not making
the best of our opportunities when we have them, and lack of
observation. The beautiful dark blue plumage of the male Satin Bower-
bird ( Ptilonorhynchus holosericeus ) is a case in point; the facts
were first ascertained from observation of birds in the Melbourne
Zoological Gardens. Then, again, there is the Pacific Gull ( Gcibianus
pacificus ), which takes about four years (at present I am not certain
as to the exact time -- it may be a little longer) to attain the fully
adult plumage. It is curious to note that in the young birds the
feet and eyes are brown, like the plumage, and the beak whitish, and

dark at the end; but the adults have the beak and eyes bright
yellow and the legs whitish-yellow. These birds are not content
with changing the colour of their feathers only. Again, in many of
the Albatrosses the beak is almost black in the young birds, but
changes to whitish later. The Straw-necked Ibis (Carphibis spini-
collis), when young, has the top of his head covered with small
blackish feathers, but in about three or four years these are all
moulted, and the bare black skin shows instead ; light-coloured lines
appear later across the top of the head, and give the appearance of
cracks in the skin.
In the flight aviary a pair of Yellow-breasted Shrike-Robins
(Eopsaltria australis ) live in company with the Honey-eaters, but
woe betide any other bird of the former species that may be put in ;
the male Robin dashes at it at once, and the newcomer is usually
soon killed. The Yellow-breasted Shrike-Robin is far more pugnacious
than the Honey-eaters, frequently driving them away from their
feeding dishes. The Honey-eaters do not seem to treat newcomers
so harshly, but they are bad enough. Wood-Swallows (Artamus
sordidus ), Blue Wren-Wai'blers {Malurus), and White-browed
Scrub-Wrens ( Sericornis frontalis ) live peaceably, possibly because
they have plenty of room and cover. Most of these birds object to
strong wind, and are usually to be found on the sheltered side of
the aviary. In hot weather they are all very fond of bathing, and
fly to and fro through the fine spray of the fountain, or else sit on a
branch where the water can fall on them, and become nearly
drenched.
When the Gardens were first formed, more than fifty years
ago, Nankeen Night-Herons (Nycticorax caledonicus ) used to camp
during the day in the large eucalyptus trees ( E . rubra), and they
and their descendants have continued to do so ever since. The
birds probably breed in the tall trees on the Murray swamps in
New South Wales, therefore during the nesting season only the
young birds of the last season are here, and the young males have
not got their adult plumage. Directly the Garden bell rings, and
the visitors depart, these birds fly down to the Gull and Water-fowl
enclosures, and hunt round for scraps of meat that may be left ;
they are very tame. In the Cairo Zoological Gardens I noticed the

same thing; there the Nankeen Herons ( N . griseus ) roost all day on
the trees in the Gardens, and at night go to the Nile swamps to
feed. Our birds usually go to the low-lying grounds and shallow
water near West Melbourne ; they leave the Zoo just at dusk.
The graceful Pied Grallinas, which assemble in flocks during
the winter, come from the districts around Melbourne into the
Zoological Gardens in the evening to roost, about an hour before
the Herons leave. Two pairs of wild Grallinas have for years nested
in the Zoo, but each pair has its own restricted area. The same
applies to two pairs of White-backed Magpies (Gymnorhina leuco-
nota), except that these birds have a battle royal should one pair
seek to poach on the other's ground. On several occasions pinioned
Magpies were liberated in the Gardens, but they were all attacked
by wild birds sooner or later, as they unwittingly trespassed on their
area. They seemed to be frequently getting on the prohibited
ground of one pair or the other, and found it a difficult matter
when they were attacked by the wild birds. As they could not fly
away, they simply lay on their backs and fought with beak and
claws, often effectively.
Three pairs of Black-and-White Fantails (Bhigndura mota-
cilloides) nest in the Gardens, also many pairs of White-plumed
Honey-eaters, and these, also, each have their separate parts. All
these birds drive away their young as soon as they are able to look
after themselves ; therefore our wild breeding stock never increases.
In the Gardens there is a Queensland Cassowary (Casuarius
australis), which, when about seven years old, laid two eggs. Before
that it had always been regarded as a male bird, but the male and
female are practically identical in appearance. The same applies to
the Emu, but the male Emu drums and the female makes a grunting
noise, whereas Cassowaries are very silent birds, and one cannot,
therefore, easily identify the sexes by the sounds uttered.

When the British visitor arrives at Circular Quay, Sydney,
provided he has not landed at any other Australian port, the question
he will probably be asking himself, if he is an ornithologist or bird-
lover, is : " Am I really twelve thousand miles away from home ? "
One of the first, if not the first bird to arrest his attention will be
the House Sparrow (Passer clomesticus ), for it may be seen and heard
in numbers about the goods sheds on the Quay before he leaves
the steamer's side, although it is less common in the breeding season,
which usually commences in August. In the city, however, and the
public parks and gardens it is ubiquitous.
Another common acclimatised species is the Starling (Sturnus
vulgaris), which may be seen about the larger public buildings of the
city and the grass lawns of Hyde Park and the Botanic Gardens ;
farther afield in the outlying suburbs it occurs in autumn and winter
in immense flocks.
Yet another introduced species may be seen in the parks and
gardens of the metropolis, and occasionally resorting to the larger
buildings in the city -- the Spotted-naped Dove ( Turtur suratensis ),
of South-Eastern Asia; it is common in the suburbs. About the
mansions of Double Bay, Bose Bay, and Yaucluse, may be seen
another acclimatised species from the latter Continent, the Indian
Myna ( Acridotheres tristis ). It is remarkable that this species,
although it has frequented the localities named for many years past,
has kept in the comparatively near neighbourhood and not spread
over the surrounding country as it has in Victoria. The same, too,
may be said of the introduced Skylark ( Alauda arvensis ), which is
chiefly confined to the vicinity of Centennial Park, Bandwick, Botany,
and the lowlands about the mouths of Cook and George Bivers.
Frequenting mostly the introduced pine (Pinus insignis ) about
Bandwick, Botany, and the western and northern suburbs, may be
more often heard than seen, the by no means common acclimatised
Greenfinch (Fringilla chloris). Far more numerous, in many of the

outlying suburbs, especially about thistle-becls, is the Goldfinch
(Carduelis elegans). Australia is paying dearly for the introduction
of foreign mammals, for many birds are destroyed by poisonous
baits laid for rabbits, or by the introduced fox, which is rapidly
spreading over Eastern Australia. Large numbers of birds, too,
perish during periods of drought, especially in Western New South
Wales.

Probably without exception, the ornithologists of the United
States possess but one opinion with respect to whom they consider
the best and most accomplished taxidermist of birds in this country.
Indeed, there is really no doubt on that point; for Mr. Nelson R.
Wood, taxidermist of the United States National Museum, is the
person in question. Mr. Wood has worked away in his rather
dismal and contracted little shop at the aforesaid institution for a
great many years. His patience, untiring industry, and studious
habits with respect to his profession--for he is truly an artist
taxidermist--are simply marvellous. He is now safely past the
sixty mark, with an accumulated experience in his art that carries
a long way toward making him a most valuable man and a great
acquisition to the working staff of the Museum. His studies,
indoors as well as in the open, have been largely given to the habits
of birds in Nature, their notes, and their attitudes under every
conceivable condition.
It is most remarkable to observe the perfection to which
Mr. Wood has brought his power to imitate the various notes of
a great many species of birds. In the woods and fields the wild
birds of all kinds respond immediately to his wonderful note and
call-imitation ; even a flock of Crows in flight, far, far overhead, will
descend to alight all about him in response to his faithful mimicry.
Whilst he is a past master in the art of mounting birds in

normal, easy, and attractive attitudes, he is, at the same time, more
successful with some groups than with others. Probably he is not
surpassed by anyone, or even equalled, in his extraordinary achieve-
ments as exemplified in his taxidermy of both wild and domesticated
gallinaceous birds, Ducks, and Pigeons. Sometimes the hardest
taxidermical nuts are handed over to him to crack. These consist
of old, dried skins of birds, all out of shape, flat and twisted with
bulging eyelids and crooked legs. He is expected to mount them
in such poses as will elicit the admiration of all beholders. Nine
times out of ten he does this very thing ; and out they come from
his old shop--perfect wonders of his art. His years of untiring
labour in all of these various lines -- and for several years past
with but one eye with which to work--have gradually filled the
great bird cases in the New National Museum, and a few people
in the world at last begin, really begin, to realise what a marvellous
collection those grand cases contain. Some of the groups are simply
superb, and special reference is made to the domestic Fowls, the Wild
Pigeons, Carolina Parroquets, the Hoatzins, Grouse -- in fact, dozens
of others, to say not a word as to what we find in the great main
cases of the hall. I have recently made a number of photographs
of Mr. Wood's single studies--or pieces, as they say in other art
lines -- more particularly of the birds of Australia and the Eastern
Archipelago. Some of my photographic work in these has recently
gone down to Melbourne for publication, and other examples of
it may be placed elsewhere later on. This is done not only to
stimulate and further the objects and aims of artistic taxidermy,
but to let people in general know what expert work in that art
really is.
To illustrate my subject here, four of Mr. Wood's pieces
have been selected, and reproductions of my photographs of them
constitute the plates to the present article. In Fig. 1 we have
an old male of the famous Cattle Egret or Heron (Bubulcus
coromandus ), a species that ranges through India and Ceylon,
extending far into the Burmese countries, China, Siberia, and
southward to the Moluccas. It has gained its name from the
habit it has of alighting on the backs of wild and domestic cattle,
evidently to feed upon such insects or other invertebrata as it

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
may discover in such places. In the group of wild African buffalo,
collected by Col. Eoosevelt and his party in that country, and
exhibited in one of the immense cases in the Mammal Hall of
the National Museum, several of these Egrets or Herons have been
introduced. The plumes on the back of this bird are of a rather
deep yellowish-buff, which is also the case with some of the plumage
of the head and neck. All the rest is of a chalky white, which is
difficult to faithfully reproduce photographically when one comes
to consider the place in which the picture was obtained. Hundreds
of people, visitors at the Museum, have admired this truly elegant
piece of work--the pity is that my photograph fails to show it as
w T ell as it should ; the reduction and the light are chiefly responsible
for this. On the other hand, the original is absolutely true to life,
and to the last feather of the specimen we have the pose assumed
by a small Heron as it attempts to preserve its line of gravity
or balance when pacing down some old stick, to reach the water
of the marsh wherein it has its home.

Birds, both large and small, whether kept in cage or aviary,
are liable to be attacked by diseases the same as any other animal,
human being, or even insect or plant.
There are pests or diseases which attack all forms of life, if
conditions are favourable; but if the bird (and it is birds that I am
dealing with) should be, as it were, below par, then it stands the
chance of being attacked.
In the case of a bird it is impossible to tell if it is below par;
hence the reason why birds, as a rule, suddenly show signs of some-

thing wrong; this is because the disease is upon them before we
know anything of it.
It must not be imagined that because birds are kept in cages
or aviaries that that is the cause of disease attacking them at times.
Oh dear, no! Birds in their wild state are also attacked. I have
picked up occasionally birds suffering from "going light," too weak to
ffy off the ground, with their breastbone nearly protruding through
their skins, and this in the months of May and June, when their
natural food was abundant. These birds, ill in tbe wild state, would
be certain to die, as they would be unable to find anything medicinal
which would remove the cause, whilst those in captivity can receive
medicinal treatment that will remove the cause; and as soon as the
cause is removed, the bird naturally begins to recover at once.
I do not profess to be a doctor. I am not, and have never
had a medical education ; but common-sense, keen observation, and
living among birds all my life has taught me much.
A sick bird should be taken in hand at once. It is no use
saying, "Well, he may be better to-morrow"; he won't, he will be
worse; the longer the disease is allowed to play upon the bird, the
longer the cure will take. This is easily understood.
Birds are not subject to many kinds of diseases. The most
often met with is --
Going Light.-- This disease will attack young birds in the
nest as well as adults; many nests of young canaries are often lost
through it, and it is caused, I believe, by birds picking up something
that has become stale and sour.
In young canaries I am convinced it is often the hard-boiled
eggs used for feeding purposes. This is a fine food if eaten up
cleanly by the birds as soon as cooked; but it is thrown out of the
feeding-vessel and soon becomes sour and contaminated by microbes
in the air, it is picked up and eaten, and then follows the trouble.
Symptoms . -- Going light is easily detected. The attack is
often quite sudden. A bird to-day is looking beautifully sleek in
feather and bold in eye; to-morrow he is slightly puffed out, his
feathers do not lie so close to his body, his eye is not so bold and
bright--in fact, although he feeds and hops about, he is not the bird
of yesterday.

194 Diseases of birds, and their treatment and cure.
Take the bird in the hand and you will find the round, plump,
healthy breast is assuming a V&apos; s ^ a P e d appearance ; the bird is losing
weight, and if not doctored at once, will rapidly lose flesh until the
breastbone is like a knife-blade and the eye is dull and sunken.
Sometimes the attack is so severe that the bird is found looking like
a round ball, and if it persists in keeping on the floor of cage instead
of the perch I consider it is beyond recovery; it is a hopeless case,
and it would be better to kill it and put it out of suffering. Some
people used to think this disease was consumption. It is not; it is
absolutely a particular form of bowel trouble, which, rightly or
wrongly, I term &lt;l gastro-enteritis," and, I am happy to say, I have
a medicine that quickly cures, by removing the cause and going to
the seat of the trouble at once. If given this particular medicine
(which is absolutely harmless) in the early stages of the disease, the
bird recovers rapidly, even in the short space of two or three hours.
I have cured nearly every bird of mine in the early stage of the
disease.
The moment the cause is removed it is astonishing how the
bird brightens in eye and assumes its sleek tightness of feather, and
puts on flesh as rapidly as it had previously lost it.
Treatment . -- If the bird is very bad, take it gently in the hand,
open the beak, and dip a knitting-needle or anything about that size
into the bottle of medicine which I call " Pinko " (which can be had
from me), drop 5 separate drops, allowing the bird to swallow each
drop before giving the next, or, of course, it might choke, then return
the bird to cage and put 20 drops into a tablespoonful of water for
the bird to drink, giving this as the only drink for two days, then
miss a day and give it again the next, it is more than likely the bird
will not require the medicine after the second day.
For Parrots, Parrakeets, and large birds a good teaspoonful of
"Pinko" in 1 |tablespoonfuls of water for the bird to drink, given
as above mentioned. It is not necessary to alter the food the bird
has been having, but in the case of Parrots, etc., give a little biscuit
or bread sop sweetened, and to insectivorous birds a little extra live
food, such as meal-worms, live ant-eggs or wasp-grubs in season.

I would like, for the benefit of the readers of the ' Avicultural
Magazine,' to record that here (E. Yorks), and as far as my ex-
perience is concerned, this malady has of late years become very
prevalent and a serious menace to the rearing, or, in fact, the
keeping, with the usual degree of pleasure, of some of the more
delicate gallinaceous birds in captivity.
By this I do not of course infer that an attack is invariably
fatal. On the contrary, if taken in time, it is usually, in the more
robust species at least, curable; but from the fact of its rather
frequent or annual occurrence and the consequent loss of condition,
involved by repeated handling, dressing, etc., not to mention
damage to plumage and the natural ill-effects of the parasites, a
bird becomes worn, anaemic, and in no condition to develop, moult
breed, or meet the winter. This reappearance I attribute in some
measure to certain species being naturally subject to the disease
and possibly carrying with them, or never really throwing off, the
worms, but largely to the fact of living in what I may term to be a
gape-infected area, where young poultry and game-birds almost
annually suffer severely, and where numerous wild and affected
Books, Jackdaws, and even Blackbirds and Thrushes, are at certain
seasons of the year repeatedly visiting the enclosures.
However, be the cause and effect what they may, it is notice-
able that young stock is more susceptible to the disease than mature
examples, also that some species, notably the Grouse family 1 &amp;quot; and
the true Pheasants, appear very much more liable to be affected
than others; also that, although the disease is most prevalent in the
summer, it is by no means unknown during the colder months.
As examples of this, I may state that we have received at
least one batch of Nut-Crackers badly affected in mid-winter, and I
have seen a whole brood of domestic Chickens suffering severely in
January, while Jackdaws have been caught here in early spring--of
* Apparently the Red Grouse is very rarely subject to the gape-worm in the

that only two examples were noted while the inquiry was in progress.

This useful and progressive Society was founded several
years ago. Its objects are to encourage the keeping of birds and
other animals in captivity, and to facilitate the importation of them.
It issues an Annual Year-Book, and, in normal times, a Bulletin
and list of specimens wanted or offered for sale. On the publication
of the second Year-Book in 1913 it was noted that the membership
had much more than doubled in the short space of twelve months,
and the book itself was for the second time very much enlarged
and some new features were added. Medals for breeding and
acclimatisation are awarded on the same lines as in our own
Society.
We have received the Year-Book for 1917, which would have
been noticed before but for the great pressure on our space. In
the very act of reviewing it we observed a notice of the Club in
our esteemed contemporary, 1 Le Chenil,' from which we translate
as follows:
" Many amateurs, on account of the times in which we live,
have to discontinue or at least diminish their collections of animals,
and it has been a pleasant surprise to receive from England the
sixth Year-Book of the Amateur Menagerie Club. This Association,
which consisted of sixty-four members in 1916, has even been
increased in 1917," and goes on to remark, " in spite of the absence
of most of his colleagues at the front or engaged on war-work,
the Secretary, Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake, has found means to collect
some papers so as not to impair the series of practical articles of
which the Year-Book gives an annual account. ... To sum up,
Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake may be congratulated on having issued, under
such present circumstances, such a pleasing volume."

illustrated by photographs and marginal sketches; and notes on
the Spectacled Owl, by Miss Chawner, similarly illustrated, and
of much interest now that this species has become so rare in
captivity.

The half-yearly Council Meeting was held on February 27th
at the Zoological Gardens, by kind permission of the Zoological
Society.
The following were present: Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo
(Chairman), Mr. A. Ezra (Treasurer), Miss Chawner, the Hon. Mrs.
Bourke, Mr. R. I. Pocock, Mr. D. Seth-Smitb. In the unavoidable
absence of Miss Alderson, Mr. Pocock kindly acted as Secretary.
The Chairman announced that letters of apology for absence had
been received from numerous members, including Miss Alderson and
Dr. Graham Renshaw.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.
The audited balance-sheet for the year ending October 31st,
1917, was submitted by the Treasurer, who announced that the sum
of #16 was carried forward to the current year.
The Secretary reported that Mr. Shore Baily had applied for
the Society's medal for successfully breeding and rearing the Mexican
Black-breasted Quail (Colinus peclorcilis ) in the summer of 1917.
After discussion the Council decided (1) to extend the time for
applying for the medal from four weeks to eight weeks ; (2) to grant
the medal to Mr. Shore Baily. The Council also considered that
attention should be drawn to the rule that the first account of the
breeding and rearing of the young birds must be published in the
Magazine if the owner wished to claim the medal.

At the suggestion of the Editor it was decided that the name
of the Society's Pathologist be added to the list of officers of the
Society published at the beginning of each volume of the Magazine,
and that the address of the present Pathologist (Prof. G. H.
Wooldridge), as given in the Magazine, be altered to the Royal
Veterinary College, Camden Town.
A report from the Hon. Business Secretary as to the disposal
of surplus copies of the Magazine was read and considered.
Friday, June 28th, was settled as the date for the Summer
Meeting of the Council, to be followed by a tea party for members in
the Fellows' Pavilion at the Zoological Gardens, the hour of the tea
to be announced in the June issue of the Magazine.
The meeting closed with a vote of thanks to the Zoological
Society for the use of the room for the meeting.

The handsome supplement before us completes Mr. Thorburn's
great work on British birds. Well illustrated in the author's exquisite
style, well written, and well printed, these extra sheets are worthy to
&apos;rank with their predecessors in their beauty of bird portraiture and
the interest of their letterpress. Dr. Eagle Clarke's notes on bird
migration are also quoted in these pages.
Fourteen races or species of birds are portrayed in the work,
mostly with wonderful fidelity. We would single out for special
mention the Hebridean Song Thrush and the St. Kilda Wren on
Plate 80a; it is difficult to say which one prefers--the handsome,
dark, richly-spotted Thrush or the alert, singing Wren, with tip-
tilted tail and crisp, raised wing. The Marsh Titmouse is seen
briskly searching for insects, almost in the very act of whisking right

happily, perched on a twig. Then we have the rare Olivaceous
Warbler of South-Eastern Europe hunting for insects, and the
Moustached Warbler slipping into a reed-brake like the Sedge
Warbler which it so much resembles.
We cannot, however, discover any reason for figuring two
forms so completely alike as the Marsh and the Willow Titmouse.
In the coloured plate they are indistinguishable from each other, so
that we learn without surprise that the latter bird so closely resembles
the Marsh Titmouse that it was not separated till 1897 ; personally,
we think 1918 all too early for this weighty operation. The gradua-
tion of the tail feathers, supposed to be of diagnostic value, is
not shown in the plate. In spite of the opinion of the latest
&lt;l authorities," to us this seems specialisation run mad.
The Greater Redpoll figured is unsatisfactory, in spite of the
beautifully rendered plumage; its unpleasant, one-eyed appearance
detracts markedly from the careful detail of the head. The hen of
the Scottish Crossbills is not only too Parrot-like but even resembles
a definite species -- the Owl Parrot of New Zealand; this likeness
being unfortunately accentuated by the diving attitude of the cock
bird, the Owl Parrot having a similar habit of dropping to cover with
closed wings. Although the pose of the Yellowshank leaves nothing
to be desired, the tibial muscles of the left leg are barely discernible
without the aid of a lens. G. R.

The Society&apos;s Prize.
in this effort, zoologically speaking, to " bring the world before you.'&amp;quot;
Bears and Bison, Deer and Antelope, are here; we note the nobl&amp;
facade of the Lion-house, the Deer in their natural landscape, and
the architectural merit of the palace devoted to reptiles. To the
aviculturist the latter part of the book will be of interest, for here
he finds space assigned to birds and ponds and cages.
The great flying-cage is 55 ft. high, 72 ft. wide, and 152 ft. in
length, and is constructed of wire netting stretched over huge steel
pipe arches; it encloses three forest trees and a pool 100 ft. long.
Under this mammoth Gothic arch the Society houses its Flamingoes,
Ibises, Storks, and Herons ; they form a large and showy flock of
birds, displayed in a manner novel to America and but little practised
in Europe. Only in London, Paris, and Rotterdam does the travelled
naturalist behold any flying cage at all approaching the mammoth
of New York.
In winter the tenants of the great cage are housed in the
building for aquatic birds ; they inhabit the small flying cage in the
centre of the house or the w 7 all cages running along the inside.
The backs of these latter are painted with scenes representing
the homes of the species exhibited, a scene in the Florida ever-
glades being depicted on the western wall, while the eastern is.
decorated with a presentation of a marsh scene in the North.
Among the smaller bird illustrations in this book we may
mention the Whooping Crane at the pool side, silent and stately as
if limned on a Japanese screen ; his burly cousin the Jabiru, with
powerful bill and long, stilted legs ; and the quaint young Spectacled
Owl, his motorist mask showing black against the downy whiteness
of his face. G. R.

Dear Sir, --My bird notes for 1917 are not interesting enough for an article.
On account of the length of the war, I parted with a good many of my birds,
keeping only a few rare birds and pets, about four hundred.
After the war, I intend to move my collection into a warmer country than
Northern France. Very few young birds were reared, of which the most interesting
is a Fruit Pigeon (Alectrcr.nas pulcherrima). My three pairs of Button's Touracos
laid, and hatched several young ones, but did not rear any. Very bad luck! Two
of the hens were bred at Villers-Bretonneux. I hope I shall be more successful
this year.
During last year I again received some good birds: a fine cock Crested
Guinea Fowl ( Guttera cristata); a cock Stone Curassow ( Pauxi galeata ) and a
cock Sclater's Curassow ( Crax sclateri); some Parrots (Tanygnathus luconensis,
Piojius violaceus and corallinus) , and a lovely Parrakeet (Palceornis schisticeps );
a great Gaboon Hornbill ( Buceros atratus) and a lot of Toucans -- mainly
Rhamphastos, Ariel, and Andigena bailloni.
In the spring I got a very fine Giant Touraco (Corythoeola cristata), but
alas ! he has long been dead. I have an Albino Jay, white with pearl-grey
"moustaches" and light blue wings, quite a nice bird. My Sun-birds grow very
old, and I lost one Amethyst (C. amethystinus) ; one Malachite ( N.famosa ); one
double-collared (C. chalibceus), and the lovely Anthobaphes violacea ; I still keep,
in perfect condition, the (Ethopyga saturata (Black-breasted Yellow-backed
Sun-bird).
It is always possible in France to get all kinds of common birds from Africa
and America, but they are much more expensive than before the war. It is now
impossible to find Australian and Asiatic birds.

of West Australia, catches the birds himself, and takes them to America, making
one trip every year. To-day he arrived in Sydney on his way to 'Frisco, and had
100 dozen mixed Finches and a few Parrots, the Finches consist of Goulds,
Pictorellas, Longtails, Masked, Ring Finches, and two pairs of Painted Finches.
The Parrots consist of six pairs of Crimson Wings, some Port Lincolns, and one
cock Pileated Parrot. About two years back he took to 'Frisco a pair of Princess

I have not seen a single Golden-crested Wren since last winter! and they
used to nest regularly in my garden and friend&apos;s gardens. In 1916 I found ten
Long-tailed Tits' nests, but from last winter till October, 1917, I never saw a bird
and feared they were extinct in this county, then one day in October I saw a
" party" of them to my great delight, so one pair survived and brought up a family
at any rate. I calculate that at least 80 per cent, of the Thrushes and 60 per cent,
of the Blackbirds were killed by starvation and cold in this neighbourhood. Tree
Creepers are nearly extinct, though none of the Tits except Long-tailed seem to
have suffered at all (I am not including Bearded Tits which are never found
just here).
Curiously enough I have seen more Nut-hatches (always common here) than
ever since last winter !
Green Plover, Redwings, and Fieldfares died in hundreds -- even wild rabbits
became practically skeletons and quantities perished. Towns and villages were
full of starving Black-headed Gulls, hunting for scraps and refuse.
I only saw one common Wren during the whole of last spring and summer,
though several have turned up again now.
Woodpeckers are not affected, all these varieties being about as usual.

these headings in the last issue, and perhaps a few notes from Cheshire may
interest your readers. It is sad to hear about the Golden-crested Wren and the
Long-tailed Tit in Hants and Hereford. It is the same in Cheshire. Both these
little birds are usually familiar, but during the whole of 1917 I saw none. Other
observers of my acquaintance had the same bad luck, though at Christmas one
friend came across a very small party of Gold-crests in Delamere Forest. The
terrible winter of 1916-17 left a marked shortage of Song Thrushes, and Fieldfares
and Redwings suffered greatly. The two latter birds are very scarce this time.
I met with few Kingfishers last year, but their numbers are now more promising.
We have Cole and Marsh Tits, Blue and Great, all in evidence, and the Robin,
Wren, and Hedge Sparrow are plentiful. The Tree Creeper survived the hard
winter, and has been fairly numerous since, also the lesser Redpoll. There have
been fewer Bullfinches than usual. It is interesting to note that the Mistle
Thrush was particularly abundant and vigorous last year, singing with great
heartiness to an unusually late date in spring. Bramblings came very sparingly
in autumn, 1916, but on the present occasion they are abundant. Lapwings are
with us in great flocks, and Golden Plovers (in certain districts always favoured
in winter), abound. The latter half of January has been mild and spring-like, and
early songsters are already in good voice. It is to be hoped that the remainder
of the winter will prove kindly, and that in the coming days of spring we may
once more find the Long-tailed Tit and Gold-crest in our midst.

weakness in the present birds in-breeding tends to bring it out very markedly in
the young.

It is interesting to note that in-breeding appears to be the natural habit
with Cranes. These birds normally produce two young of opposite sexes every
season, and the latter, according to my experience, remain together all their lives,
and do not pair with unrelated birds, except an accident happens to one of them.

Dear Dr. Renshaw, --Herewith I send you my further notes on the evolution
of patterns and growth of colour in birds. I wanted to work out points relating
to the development of metallic colouring, but unfortunately, I do not possess a
microscope ; and that belonging to a medical friend appears not to be powerful
enough to discover the ridges or papillas which produce the metallic effects.
The fact that (in the African Bronze-wing Doves) the colouring changes
greatly according to the angle at which the light falls upon the metallic markings,
the purplish-blue spots of Clialcopelia afro, becoming partly black (so approaching
those of Tympanistria), the green spots of C. chalcospila considerably more blue,
and the crimson spots of Calopelia puella var. brehmeri green, when held level
with the eye, seems to me rather to indicate ridges than papillse as the agents in
producing the effects.
If I only had the splendid microscope available in the Insect-room at South
Kensington, I might clear up the point. Years back I wished to discover how the
silver spots on the Fritillary butterflies were produced, and I discovered that the
scales on those spots were crystalline and curved over towards their distal extremi-
ties, so that they caught the light like a congeries of small mirrors. I wonder what
happens in the case of those beautiful aberrations in which the silver covers about
half the under-surface of the wings ?

The following reply has been sent to M. Decaux :
Septic enteritis is one of the most difficult diseases to cure to which birds are
liable. In treating it I have found warmth the most important thing ; the bird
should be placed by itself in a dry, clean cage (open only in front) and kept in a
warm, but properly ventilated, room.

It is well to commence the treatment by administering a drop or two of olive
oil, and, when the abdomen is inflamed, it should be painted with warm turpen-
tine. In the drinking-water put ten drops of tincture of opium and the same
quantity of tincture of belladonna, with two or three drops of dissolved gum arabic
and glycerine.
If the health of the bird improves under this treatment, it is best to com-
plete the cure by a mild tonic--a rusty nail in the drinking-water will do.

Dear Dr. Renshaw, -- The birds in the Park are at present in very good
condition. The King Penguins are particularly healthy and are not suffering from
any disease. The trouble with mycosis is in the newly imported birds, which
usually arrive in comparatively poor condition owing to the strain upon them of
the long voyage. Few people probably realise how much difficulty is met with
in bringing the birds from the far south. A sufficient stock of dried fish has to
be taken out to provide food for them, and it was only by the generosity of Messrs.
Salvesen &amp; Co., who incurred great expense in the matter, and by great care and
trouble on the part of the captain and crew, that two lots of birds were brought
over successfully. In each consignment one or two birds were infected with
mycosis, and as unfortunately no means as yet have been found of treating it
successfully, they died shortly after their arrival. The others were apparently
free from infection, and have had remarkably good health ever since they came,
which in the case of the first consignment was over four years ago.
I have not noticed any marked change of colour in the Spotted Emu, and
doubt very much whether there is any specific difference between the three Emus
in the Park. The Emus have lately laid a number of eggs, but none of them
shows any sign of sitting, and so I fear that they are all females. We have
the reverse difficulty with our Rheas, all of which I fear are males; we had the
misfortune to lose one or two females which we formerly had. The cause of
death was apparently in each case a stoppage of the intestines by masses of un-
digested grass, and I should be very glad to know whether anyone who keeps
Rheas has experienced this difficulty with them. The deaths have always
occurred in winter, when the grass is lacking in sap.
We are hoping for good breeding results this season among our Water-
fowl, and a pair of Cereopsis Geese are already nesting. We shall probably have
some interesting hybrids among the Ducks. We bred last year some hybrids
between the British Widgeon and Gadwall; they turned out almost exactly like
Chiloe Widgeon. You probably know that we have three hybrids between the
Australian Black Swan and the Canadian Goose.
I shall look forward to seeing you this summer.
With kind regards, I am, yours sincerely,

We climbed out of our dinghey on to the rough stone pier
and made our way past a well-built fisherman's house, ornamented
with pieces of skate and other dried fishy fragments, into the yard
littered with old nets, lobster pots, and the various impedimenta of
the piscatorial art characteristic of the craft and the vicinity.
Turning our faces inland we traversed several fields laid down
in hay grass by a narrow footpath, crossed a good road, and began
the gentle slope which led up to the nearest heather-clad hill. After
a gentle climb of a few hundred yards we came out on a rough
country road skirting the bases of the hills, and proceeded to
follow it.
We followed this rough road for several miles, having for
the most part rough heather-clad hills on our left, and treeless
hedgeless fields, dotted with small neat houses, on our right.
Presently the road turned inland, and, crossing a little brook,
we began to ascend a wide shallow valley towards the crest of
the hills.
We gradually ascended a winding track used to bring down
the cart-loads of peat from the hilltops, and a Blackbird, who had

his nest in a mossy bank, flew clacking and chattering away from
the roadside as we passed by.
Common Gulls, which were nesting in some numbers in the
heather of the hilltops, made a vast and unpleasant clamour.
We ascended the track until the last little patch of cultivation
and the last little thatched cottage had been left behind; and,
jumping the little ditch which bordered the rough road, we made
our way over the tussocks and tall rough heather. At this particular
spot the heather was much larger than is usual in this part of the
world, and reached well above the waist.
As we approached the largest and thickest patch of heather
a big brown bird with a ring at the base of its tail rose almost from
under our feet, and flapped silently away, and in a few feet more
we were looking down on the nest and nestling of the Hen Harrier.
The pale-grey male bird had meanwhile put in an appearance,
chattering noisily and flying uneasily to and fro at some distance.
He presently alighted in the heather, perhaps 100 yards away.
Originally the nest when found had contained two addled
eggs and one nestling, and the latter alone now occupied it.
The nest itself was a large flattened structure made of the
stems of the larger heather plants, and of coarse bents and rushes
apparently well trodden down, and was about 18 in. in diameter.
Placed a few inches only above the ground, it had kept
remarkably dry, considering the damp nature of its surroundings.
The nest was well hidden in the middle of a clump of tall
thick heather plants, not more than 30 yards from the rough road
aforesaid, nor more than 150 from the nearest crofter's cottage and
its surrounding patches of cultivation.
The nestling, now some four weeks old, is about the size of
a Pigeon--rather a wild fluffy-looking youngster which snaps feebly
on handling. The only food-remains to be seen are portions of a
large vole.
The cock bird continues to circle round about but never
comes very near to us.
Continually he gives out his chuckling ringing cry, and
from time to time he settles down in the heather and watches us
suspiciously.

The hen, after one circular flight, has disappeared.
The nest probably would not have been found had she not got
up under a searcher's feet and betrayed its situation.
A couple of Common Gulls, who have probably a young one
hidden in the heather, now commenced to mob the male Hen
Harrier, stooping at him continually with much unnecessary
clamour, until at last he cleared off. We, having photographed
the young bird, also turned back to the road and retraced our
steps to the boat.
A week later we made the same journey once more, and saw
a great change in the nestling, which appeared much better feathered
and almost doubled in size, besides being far bolder and almost
truculent, throwing itself backwards and snapping its bill violently.
The old birds pursued the same tactics as before, and whether
their offspring eventually joined them we do not know, for in another
week circumstances over which we had no control had carried us far,
far away, where Hen Harriers were not.

Have you ever wondered why young Gouldian Finches have
those beautiful phosphorescent turquoise studs on either side of their
mouths ? I have not noticed similar markings on any other young
birds. They are really wonderful: the four points shine in a dull
light like small electric sparks, and do not fade away till the young
ones have been out of the nest for a few weeks. Is it to guide the
old birds to the mouths of the young ones when feeding them ? It
lasts for some days even after the young ones die, and seems quite
like a living light. If they were in the habit of nesting in dark
places it would be more easily understood, but, building as they do
out in the open, there scarcely seems any reason for it other than
that Nature wishes to beautify the young.
We have had a very long and trying winter this year. The

last month or so we have had nice warm weather, but the winter
was very wet and cold. Although not cold enough for frost--the
thermometer never reached freezing point the whole winter--we had
abnormal rainfalls. Sometimes it rained continuously for a whole
day or more, and some weeks we did not see the sun for more than
two or three days. This, of course, was very trying for the poor
little birds, and many of the young in the early broods perished from
the damp. The last round, though, have done much better, and this
month I have on the wing 5 Gouldians, 9 Long-tailed Grass Finches,
5 Mask Finches, 7 Star Finches, 2 Napoleon Weavers, 3 Crimson
Finches, 2 Firetails, 3 Fire Finches, 9 Bicheno Finches, 5 Madagascar
Weavers, 4 Diamond Sparrows, and numerous Waxbills, etc.
I devote myself entirely to the smaller birds, a pair of
Diamond Doves being the largest birds I have in my aviaries.

I saw specimens of the Weaver Birds known as the Jackson
Whydah Bird or the Dancing Bird. In ordinary times these birds look
quite uninteresting, and very much like our common or garden
Sparrows; but in the courting season a great change takes place, for
the cock bird suddenly develops the most enormous tail, and all his
feathers, except the strongest of his wing feathers, turn jet black.
You can't imagine how absurd a court train of black moire looks on
a little bird shaped like a Sparrow and about the same size. Perched
on a stump of maize or a stem of millet, it makes a fine and fanciful
picture, and one in which a Japanese artist would delight. I wonder
if it has adopted this peculiar form of plumage to attract the female,
because most of the birds in Africa have splendid tail feathers ! It is
one of their most noticeable features. This wise bird may have
thought its courting would be more favourably received by the
object of its adoration if it could, for the time being, turn itself into

one of the superbly-tailed male birds. But why its greyish-brown
colouring should change to black I have no idea; its funereal
appearance does not suggest courtship.
It has been called the Dancing Bird, because in the courting
seasons, which happen twice a year, it dances in the early mornings
and evenings to attract and please the female. This little form of
flirtation is very pretty. First of all, the male bird cuts down the
long thick grass as closely as if it had been mown, in a beautiful
circle, leaving a round patch in the middle of it. This little patch
resembles the crossed swords of a Highlander, over which he dances.
With infinite lightness and joy the male bird, with his head thrown
back and his big tail upraised till head and tail nearly touch, and
with feet hanging down, bobs up and down and crosses over and
round the little tuft of grass in a way which obviously pleases both
the wooer and the wooed. I have seen more than a dozen of these
Whydah birds, each with its own dancing ground, all performing
their dance of love at one time.

By J. H. Gurney, F.Z.S.
On April 6th, 1915, Mr. James Vincent found a nest of the
Long-eared Owl ( Asio otus ) in the vicinity of Hickling Broad, and

situated on the ground--a very unusual position for the nest of
this species, which generally breeds in fir trees. On x^pril 15th,
accompanied by Dr. S. H. Long, I was taken to see this nest,
which then contained five eggs. The " nest " was placed in the
middle of a small plantation about a quarter of a mile from the
Broad, and was nothing more elaborate than a slight depression
on the oak-leaf-covered ground, beneath a growth of brambles.
These served admirably to conceal the Owl when sitting, though
they impeded her in her exit from the nest when suddenly

disturbed. As we approached the nest we passed the male bird
standing in his diurnal retreat, the junction of bough and bole
of an adjacent fir tree, whilst the female was on her eggs, sitting
with " horns " erect. This habit of sitting with erect horns, if
the erectile ear-tufts may be so termed, is apparently protective,
and the same habit has been observed with the Great Crested
Grebe [cf. 'Field,' February 19th, 1910), although the latter bird
does not always assume this attitude when incubating [cf. 0. J. Pike
in 'Adventures in Bird Land,' p. 62). The raising of the ear-tufts
by the Great Crested Grebe undoubtedly increases its resemblance
to the reeds; in the same way the Owl's horns tend to merge the
bird's head into the surrounding foliage.
The subsequent history of this Owl's nest has been admirably
described in ' British Birds,' vol. ix, p. 58, by Miss E. L. Turner,
who was able to secure some beautiful photographs of the incu-
bating Owl, showing the half-closed eyes and erect ear-tufts. From
time to time food was found in the nest by Miss Turner, namely,
short-tailed field mice, some very young water voles, chaffinches,
a blackbird, and the tail of a swallow. Thrush's feathers were also
observed lying about.
According to my limited experience these Owls are beneficial
rather than harmful. A couple of nests, which hatched out some
years ago near Cromer, were found to contain a missel thrush, a
song thrush, three young rats and a mouse, and, when inspected
on another occasion, four young thrushes, a rat and a small rabbit ;
no game. On another occasion a well-used roosting-place was
visited, where as many as six Long-eared Owls could be seen
dozing in the day-time, and, after due search, thirty-eight pellets
were collected. This was in January, in a wood near the sea, at
Trimingham, where all Owls are protected. Nearly all these pellets
contained mouse-remains, in addition to the fragments of two
beetles, probably the large dung-beetle, and four skulls or beaks
of finches.
Gamekeepers vilify these beautiful birds on insufficient
evidence, and thus make an excuse to destroy them. Only this
year it came to the writer's notice that a Long-eared Owl had been
shot (on June 11th, 1915), after being accused of molesting chickens.

The bird was taken to the taxidermist, Mr. Roberts, of Norwich, but
not the trace of a chicken could we find. Personally, I have only
once known a Long-eared Owl to take a pheasant, though they are
said to be fond of very young leverets; but, considering the outcry
against ground-game by farmers in this country, who will blame
them for this ?
In most counties, or County Council areas, an all-the-year
protection is given to Owls; but it is merely a nominal protection,
which the police are at no pains to enforce. By giving directions
to their keepers, landlords and other game-preservers might do
much in preventing the destruction of these useful birds.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
That wise old philosopher, King Solomon, was evidently
aware that the child is the father of the man (Prov. xxii, 6);
but, though he was assuredly a bit of a Darwinian in his views
(Eccl. iii, 18-20), he does not seem to have known that this was
physiologically true.
The distinctions between the embryonic forms of some species
which become widely differentiated when adult are very slight;
and, as Prof. Huxley pointed out, it is quite in the later stages
of development that the young human being presents marked
differences from the young ape. Birds are so closely related to
reptiles that, as Frank Finn observes (' The World's Birds,' Intro-
duction, p. xi), " if birds did not possess feathers, it would be
doubtful if they could be separated from the reptilian class ";
therefore, it would seem as if those birds which are hatched in a
naked condition are more nearly related to the reptiles than those
which are clothed with down ; but this does not necessarily follow,
since the presence or absence of down on the young may be an
adaptation to varied conditions.
When nestling birds differ greatly from their parents in
colouring, I think we may conclude that their plumage represents
fairly closely that of a considerably earlier age in the history of

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
their species :* the colouring generally is more uniform and less
brilliant; thus if we take as an example the distinctions noted
in the British Museum Catalogue of the Parrots we find Chrysotis
augusta, young, " Has the occiput and hind part of the head
green; also the posterior parts of the cheeks are tinged with green."
C. mercenaria, " No red wing-speculum." C. cestiva, " Has no yellow
on the head and no blue band on the forehead, the whole head
being green." C. ochrocephala, "Yellow colour of the crown more
restricted or entirely wanting, and less red on the bend of the wing,
where sometimes it is entirely absent " (probably immature and
nestling plumages). G. auropalliata , " Wants the yellow collar on
the hind neck." C. agilis, " Has no red on the primary-coverts,
which are green, and no bluish tinge on the pileurn." I have
omitted several descriptions of young said to have a red wing-
speculum, because I strongly doubt this being a nestling character;
I think the examples should have been described as " immature,"
being in a transitional stage from the nestling to the adult plumage.
It is only what one would expect in birds like the Parrots,
the prevailing colour of which is green, that blue or yellow varying
through orange to scarlet should be developed in their plumage :
lutinos (answering to albinos in other groups) are not particularly
rare among them, and are probably the result of constitutional
delicacy. In the Budgerigar we also get a blue form, which 1 regard
as practically a melanistic type due to unusual constitutional vigour.
The late Mr. Joseph Abrahams assured me that the yellow form
resulted from close inbreeding, so that the blue form may, perhaps,
be produced by a directly opposite treatment.
By the way, if, as Pycraf&apos;t tells us in his ' Story of Bird-Life,'
p. 25, " Blue colouring matter has never yet been found in birds.
The blue colour of certain feathers is due solely to structural
characters," how is it that the elimination of yellow from green
feathers leaves them blue and the elimination of blue leaves them
* After writing the above, it occurred to me to wonder whether this idea had
also struck Darwin; so little escaped that marvellous man that it seemed
impossible that he could have overlooked it: sure enough (' Descent of
Man,' second edition, p.742), I found -- "We may admit as probable that
the young have retained an ancient state of plumage."

yellow ? If the blue is an optical effect produced by minute surface
striation, as in many metallic-blue or blue-glossed butterflies, it
cannot be eliminated without a structural modification of the
surface of the feathers or of the pigment which they contain, which
is inconceivable to my mind.*
As I remarked in a letter to our Editor, of November 29th,
1917 (see the February No., p. 108), it is quite possible that at
an early stage in bird-life, no pattern existed in the plumage: the
nestling coloration of many species certainly favours this view,
although that of the numerous protectively ornamented youngsters
would seem to refute it; but, if the colouring of the latter was
gradually acquired for purposes of concealment, there must have
been a time at which such colouring first became needful, previous
to which period the plumage may have been unmarked. If, then,
all danger were to be removed for a considerable period, one might
anticipate occasional reversion to a monochromatic character in the
newly-hatched young, and I have an idea that this occurs in certain
long-domesticated forms of fowls and ducks.
Some of the most gorgeously coloured birds, such as the
Gouldian Finch, are extremely soberly dressed in their infancy, in
that species the slight wash of green on the upper parts is the only
indication of its lovely adult colouring. To watch day by day the
change from one plumage to the other is very interesting, the new
feathers growing over the old before the latter drop out; at any rate
that was what happened to the birds imported in nestling plumage,
in those which I bred I could not get near enough to see whether
the same process was carried out.
{To he continued.)
* Strictly speaking, I suppose all colour is the result of a structural arrangement
of infinitesimal atoms reflecting certain light-rays; but I don't see how
green, which is a combination of blue and yellow, can be so altered as to
lose a feature not due to pigment.

OSTRICHES,
By J. K. Butter, M.D.
(Concluded from p. 176.)
My Ostriches very often suffered from excoriations on the
inside of the mouth and throat, which soon spread, and were
evidently very painful, as they were unable to swallow food, and
when they picked up food would fling it out of their mouth again.
One should at once be on the look-out for these aphthae. I used
the liniment of iodine and tincture of iodine mixed in equal parts,
and painted it on night and morning. This soon had the desired
effect. When they wanted an aperient I dissolved six or eight ounces
of Epsom salts in a quart of water and poured it down their throats.

Mix well together and damp down when feeding birds.
Give this mixture for feed in the morning and cut grass or
chopped cabbage for evening feed--Monday ; on Tuesday reverse
the feeds, and so on every day alternately. Stale bread or meat
cut up is very good for them during the day, keep them well supplied
with crushed bone, crushed oyster shell, and crushed flint. These
can be had from Spratt's Patent Food, Ltd., 24, Fenchurch Street,
London. Keep pens well cleaned out, also keep plenty of clean
sand and gravel down for them to dust in. If weather is very wet
put them in the shed, although mine just went in and out when it
pleased them. When weather is very cold or wet an extra feed
of maize helps to keep them warm. Always have plenty of clean
water for them to drink.
The finest feathers are grown by the male birds, although
the hens grow nice white feathers as well. After six months you
can gather the crop of feathers, and afterwards every nine months-

kept a black bag made like a long stocking which was pulled over
the bird's head and neck, after the bird had been pushed into a
corner of the shed. The corner must be V-shaped, and they will
stand perfectly quiet whilst you cut all the full-grown feathers with
a strong pair of scissors from the wings and tail, leaving the stumps
2 in. long. The ends ripen in about three months' time, and gradually
fall out, or the bird pulls them out; or if necessary you can pluck
them, always keeping the two kinds of feathers separate, as the
male birds have the finest. Both my adult birds would allow
me to mount their backs, and carry me. They can also be har-
nessed to a cart as well as ridden bare back. They are very fond of
rolling and dusting themselves where they find sand and gravel
plentiful, and for that purpose I kept about twelve cartloads
in the field in a heap. We used the eggs in the house, and they
made a splendid omelette when fried, and taste very rich. The
egg equals in bulk thirty to thirty-three hens' eggs. The flesh
of the ostrich, especially off the thighs, is dried and eaten as
biltong in South Africa. It is tough and coarse in fibre, and keeps
well in this country, as I had some sent me once from that region.
Adult birds, as a rule, seek safety in flight, but the chicks if suddenly
alarmed fall to the ground in a state of collapse like death feigning,
and adult birds have been known to do the same thing on the sudden
appearance of an enemy, squatting down with outstretched head
and neck, and in a state of collapse. The birds are then very
difficult to distinguish among the surrounding ant-hills. They have
a way when running of flapping and jerking their wings, which are
alternately raised and depressed. I have seen mine do this, evidently
in play, when chasing one another in the field. Ostriches as a rule
are fairly good livers, barring accidents, to which they are very prone,
being such inquisitive birds, about fourteen or fifteen years is their
term of life in my opinion. To show how easily a flock of twelve
or fifteen birds is managed, I well remember the late Mr. George
Sanger having a dozen birds with his travelling circus, and they
were carried in a large open-looking brake, when travelling from
town to town, and on the arrival of the circus at its pitch, the
ostriches were let out by coming down a special step-ladder made
for the purpose into the field to graze, and were driven by some

GAPES,
By Arthur F. Moody.
(Concluded from p. 196.)
Prevention.
Regarding precautionary measures, which, with early treat-
ment are greatly to be recommended, we usually each spring and
autumn liberally dust powdered quicklime or common salt (the
latter in the proportion of 3 to 4 cwt. per acre appears the most
effective, but owing to its corrosive qualities it is advisable not to
allow it to come into direct contact with wire-netting) over all pens
and enclosures thought to be tainted. We are most careful to
thoroughly cleanse, and at intervals scald, all food and drinking
vessels, and to give during the hottest months of the year to such
birds as have not access to natural water only boiled or fresh spring
water. Also, we have thought it advisable to dress all young
Pheasants, etc., over a fortnight old once a week until out of danger,
and occasionally mix with the food of such species likely to contract
the disease a small quantity of bruised garlic or onion. The former is
better, and although we look upon it as having no curative proper-
ties, it is used with the idea that a bird whose breath and respiratory
organs are thoroughly impregnated with the fumes is less likely to
develop the parasites or prove an attractive breeding-ground.
Cure.
As to cure and actual treatment of birds affected with gapes,
I may perhaps be allowed, after again emphasising the importance
of early treatment, to shorten a long story by stating that after
having tried various recognised and advertised remedies I have found
none safer or more efficient (this, of course, without saying it is the
best) than the preparation sold under the name of " Camlin," and
manufactured by Messrs. Gilbertson &amp; Page, Ltd.
This is one of the powders to be blown from specially designed

bellows and inhaled by the bird, which is confined in an almost air-
tight box or coop (we use a box fitted with a glazed top, which is
kept darkened with a sack until it is desired to see how matters are
progressing).
It is but fair to add, however, that, according to my experience,
there is in all severe cases an element of risk in the use of any
powder, vapour, or spirit powerful enough to kill or dislodge the
parasite worms, for, putting aside the narrow margin between
parasite and bird or animal life, it occasionally happens that a bird
will suffocate through being unable to cough up or clear the trachea
(windpipe) of a ball of dead or unattached worms.

Diarrhcea. -- -Birds are not often attacked by this complaint
if suitably fed; but occasionally a bird will void a chalky excrement,
and, if not attended to, it will collect little by little on the vent
feathers, harden, and seal the vent, and cause a sort of stoppage.
Directly this chalky excrement is observed, give a small pinch of
saline in its tin of drinking-water--about as much as will cover a
threepenny-piece--let it fizz by stirring, and then give it to the bird.
This will cool the blood and clear the bowels. I have found Andrews'
liver salts the best for the purpose. Next day put a good pinch of
prepared chalk in the water, making it quite milky. Let the bird
have this for a day or so until the condition of the excrement is
normal.
Colds or Chills. -- Birds should always be kept out of a
direct draught, it would be better to put the bird out in the roughest
wind than have him in a place where a cool draught (no matter
how gentle the draught of air) was moving over him. Sometimes
birds with the best of care will get a chill, and this generally at
moulting time, it depends upon the weather conditions a great
deal; for instance, a warm day, followed suddenly by a more or

Mr. P. F. M. Galloway,
less sudden change to a low temperature and damp, may often cause
it. Especially in the latter part of September and early October, the
days, often warm and sunny, may be followed by a heavy downpour
of rain late in the afternoon, a damp atmosphere at night often being
accompanied by frost before morning ; this type of weather will give
birds a chill sooner than any other, and especially those that have
not completed the moult.
Symptoms . -- A bird having contracted a cold will, at the
commencement, simply shake the head a few times, making a slight
noise as if trying to sneeze. This goes on for a short time ; then it
will be seen that the bird when sitting still opens and shuts its
beak slightly; when at rest with its head tucked in its feathers a
squeaking noise will be heard, exactly like a canary with asthma
(which, by the way, is not always asthma, but a cold, that if not
checked at once will turn to asthma). As the disease progresses
and the bird sneezes, a watery discharge will be observed on the
nostrils, which after a time hardens and forms a scale over the
nostril, compelling the bird to breathe through the mouth, as indi-
cated by the beak constantly opening and shutting. Now whilst the
cold can be confined to the head it can be cured, but if neglected
it will gradually w&apos;ork its way down to the lungs and then it is
hopeless ; the bird is soon dead, probably from pneumonia.
Treatment .--Directly a bird is found sneezing, place in its
drinking-water, which should be given warm, a few drops as directed
of any of the advertised medicines for colds. I think Ditchfield's
lung tonic is as good as any if the bird is put into a dry and very
warm atmosphere; this will help to cure the bird in a much shorter
space of time. It is not necessary to alter the diet, but after the
bird is cured give a little tonic in its water. Parrish's chemical
food is useful, this will tone up the system and put the bird on
its legs again.
Disease op the Feet. -- -Soft-billed birds seem more disposed
to sore feet or toes than hard-billed birds, the feet of the former
being more delicate and tender.
Symptoms .--The bird frequently holds up its foot and tucks
it under its breast feathers. After a day or two it will hardly bring
the foot into use at all; if the bird's foot is examined it will be seen

that the foot, or maybe only one of the toe joints, is very slightly
swollen. On the sole of the foot, under the swollen joint, will he
seen just a very tiny brownish mark. If the bird is left to take
its chance it will be noticed that when it gets any dirt on its foot
it will he certain to he collected on this very spot, and if the foot
is not washed, the dirt will become as hard as cement and the toe
joint becomes more inflamed and swollen ; the toe, up to the inflamed
joint, will wither up and drop off like a dead branch of a tree, and,
of course, the bird is disfigured for all time.
Treatment .--As soon as a bird is seen holding up its foot
rather often it should be caught up, examined, and if there is any
excrement and dirt on the foot, thoroughly wash clean with warm
water which has had a pinch of boracic acid dissolved in it; if it
is found that a little brownish mark has formed on the under part
of the foot (and the mark may only be the size of a dot made by
a pencil), rub the joint with boracic ointment. Rub it well in,
then return the bird to the cage, keeping nothing on the drawer
hoard but moss or cut grass. Repeat the treatment for a few days,
and, as soon as the bird has ceased holding the foot up and the
inflammatory condition has subsided, with a small brush paint the
foot all over with a little iodine; this will act as an antiseptic and
also case-harden the feet as it were, and causes no inconvenience to
the bird.
Fits.-- At times birds may become attacked by fits.
Symptoms .--A bird suddenly * attacked will drop from its
perch and flutter all over the bottom of the cage, it will then come
to and hop on to its perch, shake its plumage, and go on feeding
as if nothing had happened; later on another fit will occur, and
the bird flutter as before, with sometimes its head drawn over its
back; this fit may take a little longer to get over; after the bird
is out of the fit he will make for the perch and there sit in an
uncertain manner, more or less rocking backwards and forwards,
and have a dazed appearance. The fits will attack him at very
frequent intervals; the bird will have lost flesh and the flesh that
remains will have turned to a dark or purplish tint, as if the blood
had become stagnated, the bird's constitution becomes thoroughly
undermined and a severe fit ends the bird's life, by its rupturing

a small bloodvessel, maybe on the brain or in the region of the
heart.
Treatment .--On the very first sign of giddiness take the bird
gently in the hand and wet the top of its head with cold water,
as soon as the bird has recovered mix a little bromide in water until
it is quite milky in appearance and let the bird drink it, let it have
it for a whole day. If it refuses to drink, hold the bird, open the
beak and drop 4 or 5 separate drops into the beak. Keep the bird
on a low diet and in a quiet place undisturbed ; the second day give
a little Andrew's liver saline in the water, this will cool and thin
the blood somewhat.

This is in every way an attractive book, and it has an
attractive title. It is compact, well printed, and well illustrated.
The story of bird-life is told month by month, and it is a bright
and pleasant story, full of personal field observations : the volume
will be found of real interest and usefulness by students of bird-life.
If it has a fault, there is almost too much matter for the size of the
book -- birds' names come and go too quickly, often, and we should
like to hear more about them. But now and again the author
makes amends with a short word-picture, such as this:
" While in early April we had all the promise of early spring
before us, early June carries that season to its completed perfection
and rounded fulness. When, as sometimes, though, alas, not always,
happens, its third week brings those ' perfect days in June,' when
the garden is full of roses and when the first strawberries ripen, we
feel that the coming months can have nothing quite so fair to offer.
For all too soon the longest day is reached ; the flowery wealth
of the hay-meadows falls before the scythe ; there is the blaze of
charlock and the flaunting scarlet of poppies amongst the corn, and
one feels that summer is here."

In the preface something is said as to the variety of bird-life
to be met with in and about large towns and cities. We read that in
some well-wooded private grounds within two miles of the centre
of Birmingham eighty-six species of birds have been noted, and
that thirty-six have bred. This recalls to our mind a similar careful
record near Manchester, where, a few miles out on the north side
(which is by no means the city's " rural " side), practically the same
number of species have been recently observed.
In June, " the leafy month," very pleasing reference is made
to bird-life. There is the real flavour of the woodlands in this
chapter, something very stately and captivating, as for example:
"The 'Woodwele' is, of course, the Green Woodpecker.
A forester born, he wears the Lincoln green, and his jocund shout
rings full and mellow on the ear in every well-timbered district,
whether it be amongst the great hedge-row elms of Warwickshire,
the noble beeches of Buckinghamshire, or the sturdy oaks which
love so well the clay soil of the Weald. Such oaks, which may well
have had their prime in Shakespeare&apos;s day, still cast their shade
upon the windings of the placid Avon."
Of November we feel that the picture of " its dark and
dismal days " is overdrawn. November in the country is often far
from being a bad month ; and the author himself pays grateful
tribute to the time of St. Martin's summer, which " never fails to
bring us a day or two, sometimes a whole fortnight, when it is
summer again for the few sunlit hours on either side of mid-day,
when the Hies still bask against a sunny w&apos;all and hive-bees visit
the ivy-blossom for their last scanty potations of the year." These,
indeed, are "halcyon days of kindly skies and placid sea," and
very remote from being dark and dismal. The November bird news
strikes us as particularly varied and interesting.
Is the author quite right in saying that the Hedge Sparrow's
song always seems the same, either spring or autumn ? It is easy,
we think, to recognise in February, a marked increase of warmth
and fervour in its pleasant lay. We are told that Turtle Doves
cease to coo before the end of July; but, as a matter of fact, the
note is often to be heard in early August, even, within our own
observation, as late as the 19th. It is not correct to say that at

Review&apos;s.
the end of July the Chitfchaff and Willow Wren commence to sing
again. As a matter of fact, these two birds sing throughout the
summer, though the songs are very feeble for a time, becoming
stronger again towards summer's end. In our own experience,
we find the Willow Wren's song uttered very faintly from about
the 8th to the 24th July, yet it is a daily sound. We are well
aware that dates vary in different districts, hence, though the author
tells us that it is exceptional to hear the Thrush sing in August,
such is not the case in wooded suburbs of Manchester.
Bird notes strike the ears of listeners differently, but it is
hard to understand " gluck " as the call-note of the Bedwing. Many
observers liken the note to a frightened cheep-- " zeep " or " seep."
Again, we cannot recognise in "kek, kek, the note of the Brambling.
The monthly calendar strikes us as a weak spot in the book, as
Nature calendars are often apt to be. While it is useful to note the
approximate date when a bird begins to sing, we fear that it is only
likely to cause confusion to note again the singing of the same bird
indiscriminately. Thus, in several places we are told that the Tree
Creeper sings ; and, in early January, that the Robin, Hedge Sparrow,
and Wren sing, though these three birds do so all through the
winter. Under November 20th we read: " Bramblings at beech-
mast " ; these winter Finches find the beech-mast long before that
date. The singing of the Hedge Sparrow is also noted in September,
October, and November. However, criticisms are few, and the
volume remains thoroughly useful, interesting, and entertaining.
James J. Cash.
[Several of the illustrations of the work reviewed by Mr. Cash
are from photographs of stuffed birds in the Natural History Museum
at South Kensington. We see the pair of Kingfishers perched out-
side their nest burrow, still and life-like, yet hardly stiller than they
would have been alive ; the Kentish Plovers on the beach, their tiny
young squatting and all but invisible among the rough yellow
pebbles ; the Stockdoves on their sandhill, their burnished necks
aglow with a "livelier iris" ; and the charming, altogether delightful
Pied Wagtails creeping about the rough grass. These groups are abso-
lutely life-like. It is successful taxidermy like this, based on faithful
avicultural study of living models , that recalls the dictum of the

late Sir William Flower, that " an animal can be converted after
death, by a proper application of taxidermy, into a real life-like
representation of the original, perfect in form, proportions, and

information on these points as the living creature itself."--G. R.]

Dr. Shufeldt has favoured us with a reprint of his paper on
the extinct avifauna of Vero in Florida. The fossils are of Pleistocene
age, and were obtained by Dr. Sellards in November, 1916 ; as
described by Dr. Shufeldt, they are very interesting, and the bones
are illustrated by two plates comprising twenty-five figures. The
series comprises relics of the Turkey Buzzard ( Ccithcirtes aura), the
extinct Floridan Teal ( Querquedula floriclana), a Heron of unknown
species, a Barn Owl (Tyto pratincola), and various Waders. One of
the prizes of the collection is a type bone (carpo-metacarpus) of a
new, but unfortunately extinct, Gull ( Larus vero). The majority of
the specimens are beautifully and distinctly figured in the plates
bound up with the reprint. G. R.

After consultation with our late Editor, Mr. Astley, the
Society's Prize in Literature for 1917 has been awarded to Lieut.
Delacour.
The prize is offered annually by the Society for the best
contribution to avicultural literature sent to the Magazine by
members resident abroad. The papers sent in have maintained a
high level of excellence, both as regards scientific accuracy and
literary style. During the present year we have again received
several contributions of considerable interest and merit, which will
be published as opportunity arises. The Council has been well
advised in stimulating aviculture by instituting this prize.

<bodyText confidence="0.988923606060606" page_id="32704554"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
At the beginning of the breeding season members are
reminded of the Society's Certificate. At the Council Meeting, held
on June 19th, 1914, " it was decided to give a certificate for priority
in breeding birds in cages, the dimensions of which must not exceed
one cubic yard, the conditions of the award to be the same as those
for the Society's Medal."
We would again draw members' attention to the desirability
of disposing of surplus stock to our various zoological gardens, thus
benefiting everybody in these days of few recreations. Such avi-
culture is indeed war- work.
ECLIPSE PLUMAGE.
The ' Avicultural Magazine,' consistently with its ornithic
nature, is about to assume eclipse plumage. In other words, like so
many other leading magazines, it will have to be temporarily reduced
in size. This is entirely owing to the enormously increased cost of
printing, which, for economy's sake, must be reduced in order for us
to go on.
There is no lack of vitality in the Magazine; far from it.
The Editor is able to report a much increased membership in spite
of the war. He has a drawer full of copy, and fresh papers of great
interest are continually being received. The number of new
contributors is steadily increasing. The beautiful collection of
photographs has again been enlarged. The correspondence column
is well patronised ; medals, prizes, and certificates are offered by the
Council; in short, everything points to renewed vigour as soon as
matters return to normal.
For the present, amongst papers awaiting publication are
(1) an account of the capture of Birds of Paradise ; (2) a reprint on
the development and hatching of the embryo Ostrich ; (3) an account
of the Frigate Bird post of the Pacific.
The principal features of the Magazine will be continued as
usual, and the Editor, with the continued support of his contributors,
looks with confidence to the days that are to come.

OWLS' NESTS AND THEIR CONTENTS*
By J. H. Gurney.
The Barn Owl is a quaint and useful bird, and, happily for
agriculturists, it is generally distributed, so that there are few
parishes of any extent in Norfolk where its weird shriek cannot be
heard. A measure of protection is accorded to them, yet their
numbers hardly seem to increase, which certainly is not for lack of
field mice, of which we have plenty. As far as my experience goes
in this county, the idea that they sometimes eat the young of tame
Pigeons in dove-cots, though still prevalent, is absolutely without
foundation. To-day, although the wind was not high, a large pollard
oak near my house blew down, which I regretted the more because it
had long been a haunt of the Barn Owl. As was to be expected,
there were plenty of pellets in the cavity of its trunk, some of which
were so dried that they may have been cast up twelve months or
more. With some assistance I collected 114, and had them soaked
in water. The result was the skulls, or portions of skulls, of 19 young
rats, 126 long- and short-tailed field mice, 69 shrew mice, and 3 small
birds, apparently Greenfinches--a pretty good testimony this to the
utility of the Barn Owl! I have never seen a full-sized rat in a

Owls' nests and their contents.
Barn Owl's nest; generally they are about a quarter grown or less,
and I can hardly believe they would tackle a large one. About
June 9th Mr. Q. E. Gurney found the remains of two moles in a
Barn Owl's nest, and this I regard as most unusual food, but it was
in the same parish where a mole was found before (' Zool.,' 1910,
p. 136)--a parish where these little burrowers are very plentiful. On
revisiting the nest with my nephew on the 19th two Barn Owls flew
out, but there were no more moles, only some mice pellets and one
egg. On July 3rd there were five eggs, and on the 15th six. On the
27tli three of them were hatched, and on August 4th the other two
were hatched.
A Tawny Owl's nest with young in a pigeon-locker at Intwood,
and about the same time another nest, also with young, was seen by
Mr. B. B. Biviere at Colton. In the same locker a pair of Jackdaws,
were nesting, but the tame Pigeons had apparently forsaken it,
perhaps from suspicion of such predatory neighbours. The Tawny
Owl is apt to be very aggressive when it has young, and it is
dangerous to approach the nest without a stick.
Three young Tawny Owls were observed by the gardener near
an " owl-tub " at Northrepps, doubtless a family party. I believe
there has always been one pair in this wood, except when the
vindictiveness of game-preserving, or an accident--such a&amp;getting
down a chimney--has spoilt it. Wherever they are they soon make
their presence known ; noticeable also is the constancy with which
they cling to a suitable locality. In May Mr. C. B. Ticehurst saw a
party of six young Barn Owls at Ellingham. I have never seen a
nest with more than four nestling Tawny Owls. I omitted to state
last year that from a Tawny Owl, shot near Norwich, Mr. Roberts
took four large beetles, identified by Mr. H. Thouless as Geotrupes
spiniger and G. stercorarius.
During July Mr. T. E. Gunn pointed out a Barn Owl heavily
spotted on the flanks, belly, and lower chest, which had been sent in
from North Walsham, remarking that in a long experience he had
invariably found that the spotted ones were females. I have heard
this before, and am surprised not to see it alluded to in any of our
standard works as a sexual distinction.

addition to the usual mice pellets, the skin of a mole and a freshly-
killed frog. An instance of their feeding upon frogs is given in
' British Birds,' vol. v, p. 113, but it must be very uncommon.
Neither Altum nor Fernard Lataste include the frog in their lists.
For a Tawny Owl to offer its young a toad ('Zoologist,' 1913, p. 231)
is still more remarkable, for the toad is a most unpalatable creature.
On this occasion, besides the young Barn Owls, both the old ones
were present in the elm-tree, which again is not customary when the
young have attained a large size.
Little Owls which had escaped the enemy were seen in 1914 at
Honingham bv Dr. Deacon, near Swaffham by Mr. Buxton, and at
Surlingham. This species, which was first introduced into Norfolk
by the late Earl of Kimberley, would undoubtedly breed in the
country if it were not so persecuted.
The Rev. E. T. Daubeney finds that this Owl is partial to
centipedes, and in the gizzard of one which was unintentionally
trapped at Costessey, Mr. B. B. Riviere discovered only beetles' wing-
cases. A motion before the County Council to except this species
from the Norfolk schedule of protected birds was not carried, which
shows that it is not altogether without friends among our land-
owners, the majority of whom know that the good it does outbalances
the killing of a few Pheasants. Indeed, an excellent plea in its
defence may be made out by the admirers of this comical little Owl.

It has well been said that the domain of Nature is, like a net,
everywhere connected : each portion acts and reacts upon all the
others. To take one instance only, the study of two-winged flies
only a few years ago was a neglected science, and the total number
of dipterists but small; to-day the dipterist is a very important
pei'son, since the role of mosquitoes and other two-winged flies has
been recognised in the dissemination of disease.

228 What did we do in the great war ?
A great Society like the Avicultural has in this world-war a
part to play peculiarly its own. Formed for the express purpose of
studying British and foreign birds in freedom and captivity, both
material and opportunity are close to hand. The food question is a
pre-eminent and vital problem of any bird study. How often in the
past has one asked oneself, " What does it eat ? " and how often in
back numbers of this Magazine does one meet with inquiries on the
diet of birds ! The eminent specialists who answered such inquiries
have accumulated in these columns a valuable record of the best
food for practically any kind of bird, from Hummers to Ostriches.
The Society's pathologists, again, in their post-mortem reports have
done yeoman service to applied ornithology.
The Editor, therefore, asks for more papers, letters, or notes
on the food of birds, with especial reference to agriculture : whether
they waste or safeguard the food of the nation; whether they
destroy pests or are pests themselves ; whether they should be
encouraged or discouraged ; their methods and times of feeding ;
periodical migration, whether this is complete or partial ; whether
they are simple or mixed feeders -- i. e. whether wholly, partly, or
not at all insectivorous. This inquiry practically covers the field
of a regular ornithological bureau, and the results published in the
Magazine-- a convenient permanent record ready to hand--should
be of great value.
Already the Editor has received some good papers on the
subject. Theses on bird food are, of course, no new feature of the
Magazine; for instance, one may mention Dr. Butler's model paper
on living food for insectivorous birds, published in the Magazine
some years ago, and reprinted in 'Practical Bird Keeping,' the
book chosen by the Council to form the Society's annual prize in
literature. In this species of war-work the Editor asks for more
and yet more papers on the food of wild birds in relation to the
crops ; it is a national department which is essentially the domain
of this Society, peculiar to aviculturists and to aviculturists alone.
"As the nation moved the king moved, leading it but not
outrunning it," wrote Eroude of Henry VIII ; and similarly we
aviculturists have a unique opportunity of guiding and influencing
the practical application of our favourite study. G. B.

In a " Nature Study " exhibited at the Castle Museum,
arranged by Mr. F. Leney, the results of planting the contents of
a Partridge's crop were shown. Nothing had come up except
harmful weeds, including bindweed ( Convolvulus), Persicaria, white
goosefoot, and annual Poa. The bird was sent up by Mr. Colman,
and had been killed near Norwich. A Partridge dissected in Scotland,
also in May, by Miss L. Florence, contained many seeds of the sorrel,
sheep's sorrel, and spurrey ( Spergula ). These facts are commended
to the attention of farmers.
The following plants have been identified by the School of
Agriculture at Cambridge from the crops of Norfolk-killed Phea-
sants : Ranunculus ficaria, R. acris, Taraxacum officinale, Plantago
lanceolata, Galium amarine, Galeopsis, Chenopodium album, Brachy-
podium, Silene, and Polygonum. That both Partridges and wild
Pheasants do more good than harm can hardly be questioned, but
when great quantities of tame Pheasants are reared, nature is altered
and they become destructive.
Norfolk farmers have long had a grudge against the Starling
for grubbing up the autumn-sown wheat, which it begins to do as
soon as the blade is 2 in. high, sometimes for the sake of the
germinating grain, sometimes for the wire worm or other grub to be
found at its roots ; but in either case the young corn shrivels and
turns yellow. Their diggings are from 3 to 12 in. long, or even to
24 in., and are always where the drills run. Besides these iniqui-
ties, Starlings also take a great deal of hard corn which is put
down for tame Pheasants, both at the coops and afterwards. At
the same time we must not paint the Starling blacker than he really
is, for he eats insects, as numerous dissections have proved. The
researches of Mr. J. Hammond, Mr. W. E. Collinge, Mr. R. Newstead,
Mr. J. E. Kelso, and Miss L. Florence have established beyond
question that insects may be considered as the Starling's staple food
for more than half the year.

Mr. J. H. Gurney,
The Food of Books and Wood-Pigeons . -- My bailiff has again
dressed his wheat with " corvusine " (see ' Report,' 1911), and I hope
it has protected it from Wood-Pigeons and Rooks, for wheat at
thirty shillings a comb is worth taking care of. Steeping the grain
in brine is held of no use, and some farmers still have an objection to
" corvusine," which, in any case, is not often employed for barley or
oats. The Rook is in little better favour than the Wood-Pigeon.
Mr. B. B. Sapwell, who generally speaks on behalf of the farmers,
writes: "Rooks do much harm to swedes during the winter : they
search the rings for any partially exposed roots, and with their
powerful beaks peck great holes in them ; rain-water settles in these
holes and rots the roots, and the frost gets hold of these exposed
places." It has been truly said that the Rook does an immense
amount of harm, but some amount of good, which must not be for-
gotten. Whatever redeeming qualities there may be in the Rook
and the Starling, there are no two opinions as to the destructive
character of the Wood-Pigeon. In January the Wood-Pigeon is
generally content with acorns, but it is almost the only month in the
year in which some crime cannot be laid to its charge. In February
they pick out the heads of the red clover, which is coming for hay on
the new leys, while in March their presence on the newly-sown barley
is much too frequent to be acceptable. They are not accused, how-
ever, of picking out the grain like Rooks, but are considered to con-
tent themselves, as a rule, with what the drill scatters upon the
surface. In July they are very fond of oats, besides attacking the
young swede crop, which is soon ruined, while in September ripe
elderberries are to their taste, and, later, beech-nuts become the
favourite food. Of acorns I have often found so many and of such a
size as to be astonished that their crops did not burst with them.
The rapidity with which they can digest such hard food is equally
incredible, and it is a saying that a Wood-Pigeon will eat its own
weight in a day ! As far as the eastern counties are concerned, any
increase in this species is not so much due to the killing down of
birds of prey as to the great amount of land which is planted with
green crops, which are greatly to their liking.
As a set-off to the destructiveness of the Sparrow and the
Wood-Pigeon-- and, I am afraid, we must add the Rook--the

the Barn-Owl, or White Owl, as it is termed. The Owl is one of
the seven birds which receive throughout the administrative county
of Norfolk a so-called protection by order of our County Council

stood in a generic sense, I fear the law here is little better than a
dead letter. There is one engine of destruction, the pole-trap, which

Black-headed Gulls, but to the larger species too, which somehow
find it out, and come inland in large numbers, so that it is not
unusual to see two hundred Gulls on a single field, and that even
in mild weather, when there ought to be no shortness of other food.
Whether these Gulls are to be regarded as migrants or as partial
residents is hard to say.

Some five years ago I had a conversation with Mr. Holman
and interested him in the matter of legislating to protect our bird
life. He promised me that he would introduce a Bill to Parliament
for that purpose, and on three occasions the matter w r as mentioned
in the Governor's Speech on the opening of a Session. The great
war intervened, and no doubt has caused the matter to be relegated
to the background.
I would not now revive the question at this time if it were
not that I regard it as even more necessary now, than ever before,
to legislate to protect our birds. After the war food will be required
for man and beast in greater quantities than the world may be
able to produce. Also every country will be in need of increasing
its production not only to feed its people, but to make money to
pay its war charges. Moreover, cattle and sheep will be in more
demand than ever, and anything that will increase the numbers will
be an immense help to any country.
I propose to show that we can increase production of crops

and add to our flocks and herds by protecting our birds. I also
propose to cite authorities to show that the loss from the destruction
of birds in a reckless way entails indirect loss of immense returns
that would be garnered if birds were in normal numbers.
In the United States of America it was estimated by the
Government experts at Washington that the ravages of insects and
rodents, which would have been kept in check by birds in normal
numbers, caused an annual loss of #200,000,000 -- a colossal sum.
The list of losses is given in detail with the birds that
formerly kept the pests in check. In one year in Indiana and
Ohio insects destroyed 2,577,000 acres of wheat, due to an irruption
of insects following upon the almost total obliteration of their
natural bird enemies. The result not only was a shortage in the
wheat production of over 40,000,000 bushels, hut an increase in
the price of flour.
In Pennsylvania an Act was passed giving a bounty on every
Owl or Hawk shot. This was in 1885. After a few years the
Hawks and Owls were almost exterminated, bounty being paid on
180,000. What was then the result? In a few years rats and
mice so increased that in one irruption or plague the farmers of
Pennsylvania lost #962,000 worth of damage to their grain. Needless
to say, the Legislature repealed this Act.
Without desiring to unjustly intrude the subject of bulk-
handling of wheat I venture to say that the farmers of Australia
have suffered in this year more from the destruction of bird life,
which has allowed plagues to breed, than from any old-fashioned
system of handling wheat.
In Australia Hawks are shot at sight where other birds are
spared, being regarded as not only a useless bird but as vermin.
I have seen at Jindabyne for the past ten years great numbers of
small Hawks on the ground, especially in one or two paddocks.
I have puzzled myself as to what attracted them there, until I found
that they were mainly killing and feeding on field mice. I have
shot two or three Hawks which were attacking the poultry, and
I did so with great reluctance because I am sure that for one
chicken taken there were hundreds of mice destroyed. It is,
perhaps, but little known that mice are fairly plentiful in most

pastures and fields in Australia, and unless their bird enemies are
protected they must periodically assume plague numbers.
The cotton crops of the Southern States of America have
recently been threatened with serious damage (in fact, damage to
the extent of #30,000,000 was done in one year) from the cotton
boll weevil. It was proved that the absence of bird life was causing
the weevil plague, and now from bird protective measures the plague
is being eliminated.
The Quail, strange to say, has been found in the Southern
American States to be one of the checks upon cotton boll weevil.
In Jamaica, bird life was being, and, I am afraid, still is
being, ruthlessly diminished. Whether it be from the mongoose
or from the gun the result is the same. One consequence has been
that ticks increased to such an extent that the keeping of most
breeds of cattle has become impossible. In 1909 a deputation of
residents brought this fact before the notice of the Secretary of State
for the Colonies.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
(Concluded from p. 213.)
It is, of course, well known to all of us that many young birds
much more nearly resemble their mothers than their fathers, and
that this is necessary in order to render them inconspicuous when
in the nest or when skulking among undergrowth or on the ground :
as they become adult and vigorous the males cast off this protective
camouflage and appear in full dress, but the young females change
considerably less. On the other hand, when the parents are nearly
alike and the young alone are protectively coloured, as in some of
the Pigeons, the change is necessarily similar in all the young.
Now, if we accept the view that the colouring of the nestling
is of an early ancestral character I think w T e must also admit that,
where the female nearly resembles her young, or where both parents
approximate in general colour and pattern to that of their young,

\0x25A0the character of plumage which they still retain is of far greater
antiquity than that of birds of more specialised and striking
appearance. Of course, in the first case, the male has been
differentiated by sexual selection, and in the second the colouring
has been retained for protective purposes; whereas in the Pigeons
referred to the female has inherited her colouring through her male
ancestry.
Now, if we admit this, would not the result of hybridising
(birds in which the sexes resembled each other with those in which
A spot-breasted nestling Sedge-Warbler.
they differed greatly, tend to produce females with partly developed
male characteristics? If so (and it ought to in my opinion), would
it not throw light upon the process by which the female colouring
was modified so as to resemble that of the male? It would be an
interesting experiment.
As recorded in ' British Birds with their Nests and Eggs,'
I caught a bird in my garden which I concluded was a Thrush and
Blackbird hybrid, the upper parts being deep smoky brown, the
chin and throat white streaked with dull black; the breast in certain
lights showing traces of the true Song-Thrush spotting; the bill,
which was formed like that of a cock Blackbird, was deep orange
with the basal half of the culmen black; the feet were yellowish
horn-brown.

Ancestral characters in nestlings.
I held this bird in my hand while Mr. Frohawk made a,
careful drawing of the head and breast, and this was produced as
a cut in the letterpress of the book (vol. i, p. 22). Eventually I
liberated this specimen, and later I heard a bird singing a quaint,
medley of the songs of both species in my son's garden next door.
Of course, a wild hybrid constantly hearing the songs of both of the
parent species would be likely to muddle them up.
The above hybrid should be easy to breed in captivity, and
an examination of undoubted authentic examples would, doubtless,
be more satisfactory. All the typical Thrushes seem easy to
hybridise, since I not only crossed the Grey-winged Ouzel with a
hen Blackbird, two years running, in a garden aviary ; but some
years ago, as noted in ' British Birds,' a Bing-Ouzel paired up with
a Blackbird and nested in a hawthorn hedge in my garden, the
young remaining about the place for some weeks afterwards ; indeed,
I saw them after the autumn moult.
Although the males of both M. merula and M. houlhoul differ
greatly from their females, the hybrids were interesting, the males
being less black than either species, and having a red-brown patch
on the wing similar in character to the whitish-bordered grey
patch on the wing of M. houlhoul ; the females differed a good
deal, one being much paler than the other, and nearly resembling
the ordinary female of ill. houlhoul.
In the case of the young Bing-Ouzel x Blackbird hybrids,
the band across the throat varied somewhat both in form and width ;
in colour it resembled that of M. torquata in both sexes. I was
told that I ought to have taken these birds and kept them, but
I never interfere with nests built in my garden, nor should I think
of doing so with the mere object of convincing sceptics that I could
recognise so well-marked a species as our Bing-Ouzel : its characters
are very well defined, as every British ornithologist is aware.
My conclusion, therefore, is that the plumage of nestlings
generally is much more antiquated than that of their parents ; that
those nestlings which exhibit the dullest and most uniform colouring
are exponents of the most ancient type of plumage ; that those adult
birds which most nearly resemble their young represent an earlier
type of colouring and pattern than those in which the parents have

been differentiated; and that where the females alone, or in a few
cases the males alone, have retained a general resemblance to the
young, their plumage obviously points to an earlier date than when
both sexes have assumed a well-marked and more striking dress.
These ideas may have occurred to other bird-students, but
I have not seen them definitely expressed in print. Of course,
they have no value in the eyes of the systematise because colour
and pattern may be modified without any great change in structural
characters; but I think they are of interest as an indication of the
continual improvement in the world's inhabitants. Our prehistoric
ancestors probably had little appreciation of beauty in Nature, and,
therefore, it would have been wasted upon them ; but to us who
can fully enjoy it, the glorious colouring of many birds, butterflies,
and blooms is a constant pleasure: so it is a cause for gratitude
that man is not the only living creature who delights in beauty,
for had that been the case sombre colouring might have prevailed
in Nature.
LYNMOUTH BIRDS AND THE WINTER
OF 1916-17.
By T. H. Briggs.
The effect of the winter of 1916-17 on bird-life here was
disastrous. Thrushes especially suffered; excepting one Mistle
Thrush ( Turdus viscivorus), singing on March 5th, not one of the
genus was seen or heard until November 19th, when a Song Thrush
(T. philomelus) was heard, and a Blackbird (T. merula), on the 22nd
and 23rd. During December, however, a few Song Thrushes were
heard and seen, all of which, when I could get near enough to identify
them, were T. philomelus clarkei.
None bred here, although for the last twenty years Thrushes
and Blackbirds have always built in our garden, and reared their
young. Of those found dead in the spring, all died of starvation,
and it was no use feeding them, as our house is close to the sea, and
the Herring Gulls on the water got the food first.
Robins, Hedge Sparrows, and Chaffinches almost entirely

disappeared, although a few of these birds returned at the end
of the year, but in nothing like their old numbers. The genus.
Parus also was decimated, as the Blue Tit (P. cceruleus obscurus )
was the only one of the genus whose young we saw. The Great Tit
(P. major neivtoni), the Cole Tit (P. ater britannicus), and the Marsh
Tit (P. palustris dresseri ), also nested here. Wrens alone did not
seem to have suffered from the winter. The migratory birds do
not seem to have been influenced by the weather, excepting in the
case of the genus Phylloscopzcs, very few Chiffchaff (P. collybita )
being seen or heard, and not one Willow Wren (P. trochilus), or
Wood Wren (P. sibilatrix).
Some migrants were more abundant, Flycatchers ( Muscicapa
striata), for instance, several pairs of which built, bred, and reared
their young broods here. I am also glad to say that last year
I saw more Swallows and House Martins than I have seen for
some years past.
I do hope that in the coming spring it will be found that
some songsters may have survived, and will return and breed here
again, as last spring all the woods round here were absolutely silent
of bird song.

The Editor, the 'Avicultural Magazine,'

Dear Sir, --Referring to your letter of the 9th inst., allow me
to point out to you that a special agricultural and avicultural section
has been formed among the Belgians temporarily living in England,
for the sake of investigating the problems relating to the relief of
these industries.
Under the circumstances, I would very much appreciate the
services of your magazine, it being understood that the members of
our committees will no doubt be very much interested as regards the

tisers in due course as regards the re-equipment of their poultry and

A MONOGRAPH OF THE PHEASANTS.
We have received from Messrs. Witherby &amp; Co. the prospectus
of Mr. Beebee&apos;s monograph of Pheasants. The work is to be issued
in four volumes, with numerous coloured plates, maps, and photo-
graphs. It deals with the Pheasants of the world, their nests and
eggs. Seventeen months' work was expended in the field ; twenty
countries were visited; nearly one hundred species are included and
described. The coloured plate sent is a fine delineation of the
Western Tragopan. The price of each volume is #12 10s.

As announced in our April issue, this pleasant annual function
will be held on Friday, June 28th, at the Zoological Gardens. After
the Council Meeting afternoon tea will be provided for members of
the Society in the Fellows' Pavilion at 4.15.
The bird collection now in the Gardens is of considerable
interest. Mr. Seth Smith writes to say that the Summer Aviary is
stocked with Weavers and Doves, and there is a pair of Southern
Triangular Spotted Pigeons just out of the nest. A Silkie Bantam is
in charge of two newly hatched Red Grouse, the eggs having been
sent from Scotland. There is a White-necked Crane incubating a
single egg.
In view of the manifold activities of the Avicultural Society it
is expected that this gathering will be as successful and enjoyable as
that of last year.

These islands, which lie off the coast of Wexford to the south-
east of Ireland, are distant from the mainland just over three miles,
but are connected with it by a bar or ridge, which is partially sub-
merged and partly tidal, the latter portion being called St. Patrick's
Bridge.
These bars, between the mainland and Little Saltee and
between the two islands, are evidently attributable to the accumula-
tion of shingle and stones at the meeting points of opposing currents
on the west and east of the islands.
The islands are mainly composed of gneissose or foliated
granite, traversed by numerous faults and breaks, which are respon-
sible for the indented character of the coast line. In the large
island the rocks are slightly more varied, and some basic dark green
hornblende rock occurs, as well as a true granite, near the landing
place.
This paradise for sea birds can be reached by rail from
Dublin to Wexford, thence by car to Kilmore Quay, the remainder
of the journey being accomplished by boat.
I visited the Greater Saltee, where the photos which accom-
pany this article were taken, some years ago.

Mr. G. E. Low,
The surface of the ground is gently undulating, frequently
covered with large boulders of local and other rocks. Not much
soil occurs, except in localities favourable for its accumulation and
preservation. What does occur is rather of a gravelly nature and
less clayey than on the mainland. In places on the southern cliff
slopes it is distinctly loamy or sandy, and is much burrowed into by
the numerous colonies of Puffins which congregate there.
I should think these birds outnumber all the other marine
species which breed on the islands combined. So numerous are the
burrows that, in moving along the breeding slopes, one constantly
sinks ankle-deep in the sandy loam of subterranean tunnels.
As we pause to rest on the upper slopes, we get some impres-
sion of the vast number of this species inhabiting the island.
A constant stream of birds descends from the various burrows
to the sea with clumsy flight, their little orange webbed feet extended
behind and appearing to assist in directing them.
At the same time the air is full of Puffin life flying in a wide
circle out to sea and back over the headlands. As the birds pass
over the land the tired ones fall out and drop to earth, eventually
forming large companies. The direction of their flight, so far as I
recollect, was invariably with the hands of the clock, looking from
above, but I imagine this must be largely governed by the direction
of the wind, as presumably they would land with greater facility
.against it.
Their demeanour, as they sit In large battalions, is most
amusing; with gaze full of curiosity fixed on the intruder, the more
flaring ones occasionally move a little closer with quaint waddling
gait, on their feet and heels, in order to get a better view.
As it is possible to approach to quite close quarters, " Tommy
Norie " can easily be caught with a fishing-rod, to the end of which
a fine copper noose is attached. By the exercise of some skill and a
little patience this is slipped over his head, and the astonished and
very much annoyed bird soon finds himself suspended in mid-air.
We amused ourselves for a while at this game, subsequently
releasing our captives.
On the Island of St. Kilda, west of the Hebrides, Puffins are
captured for food in large numbers by rows of horse-hair nooses

attached to a central string, weighted at each end. This is laid on a
rock frequented by the birds, and, as they alight, their feet become
entangled.
I made no inspection of nests. I have had some experience
of dealing with Parrots, and have learnt that it is wise to approach
any bird with some degree of care, even if it is quite light; and the
prospect of meeting a Sea Parrot's beak in a lonely dark burrow,
without warning, did not greatly appeal to me.
Evidences of the presence of plenty of young birds were not
wanting, as parents constantly returned from the sea with small
fish, three or four deep, held in their beaks, and one's pity was
excited for the poor wee fish in the back row, as each new arrival
in front must have meant an additional squeeze for him !
Puffins, as is generally known, are migratory, arriving (in a
fog, according to the legend) early in April and departing with their
young by the end of August. They only lay one egg.
Many other species, including the following, breed on the
Saltees, some in very large numbers : Greater and Lesser Black-
backed, Hei&apos;ring, and Kittiwake Gulls, Razorbills, Guillemots, Cor-
morants, Oyster-catchers, Manx Shearwaters, etc.
As an evidence of tameness, I might mention that, when
engaged in photography, I climbed down to a point of rock on which
several Guillemots were sitting. All but one, which was covering
young, flew away. She refused to budge, and allowed me to stroke
her and even close my hand round her neck.
From this point I could almost touch young Kittiwakes in
nests above my head, and a Cormorant sat on her nest lower down
making very unpleasant faces at me from time to time.
One could very pleasantly devote a week, in the breeding
season, to studying the bird life in this large unwired aviary 1\ x J
mile in extent. My brief visit was limited to a few hours, most of
this time being spent with the Puffins. I must therefore offer an
apology for a very incomplete and indifferent impression from
memory, and I should mention that I am indebted to a friend--
a geological expert--for any references as to the geological formation
of the islands.

By Charles J. Renshaw, M.D.
Our first sojourn was at Dublin, a city well worth a visit.
It was an extraordinary sight to observe the Sea-gulls in the midst
of a city ; but amongst other water-fowl we saw no less than three
kinds. There is an excellent Zoological Garden close to that of
Botany, in which time may instructively be passed.
Our journey led us from Dublin to Galway, and on to Recess,
a station on the line to Clifden. It is close to Lough Glendalough,
in which large pike may be found, trout, and other fish. At Cashel,,
the walk over the hill to the Holy Well is like passing over a bed
of moss, soft in heather and purple in August. A boat can be
hired here for fishing or for a visit to the kelp burners; the burning
of the kelp or thick seaweed for the making of iodine and bromine
pays well, and, in addition, lobsters can be caught and sold. Near
Ballinahinch grow many beautiful ferns, amongst them the holly
fern : the beautiful so-called Mediterranean heath of two colours&apos;
w r as also luxuriant.
As we drove along the coast road to Leenane the cry of the
sea-bird as it flew in close to the billows gave variety : here was
a brilliant hedge of red fuchsia, there a field of beautiful red weed..
Our course took us into a valley surrounded by high mountains ::
hills of sapphire blended with the green of the grass and the purple
of the heather. Life, too, was there: several species of butterfly
flew 7 past us : a large Hawk soared gracefully above. A Kingfisher
flashed past in rapid flight: the shrill whistle of the Curlew was
heard on the mountain as we disturbed him on his feed. The
watefall at the head of Killery Bay had a pretty effect as it bounded
from rock to rock, making a salmon ladder to a rivulet beyond.
On Achill Island the rocks are sublime. The marine fern
was out in its beautiful green, but most difficult and dangerous to
approach: the children, however, scrambled like goats for it. We
p assed the ruins of Mr. Boycott's house. At the sale of his effects
his goats fell to a farmer, but there was no contract to deliver, so
the unlucky purchaser was told to catch the goats. He being unable

number -- anyone ean have a shot at them, and a head of one, if he

[Concluded from p. 234.)
In the zone of the Panama Canal there are so many venomous
insects that the President of the United States (Mr. Wilson), has
issued an order under expert advice prohibiting the destruction of
any wild bird there.
Lord Kitchener, when administering the affairs of Egypt,
issued a Khedival decree forbidding the catching or killing or taking
*of the eggs of any insectivorous birds. The Egret, may it be
mentioned, is a heavy feeder on the cotton worm ; yet it was being
*destroyed in Egypt for its plumes.
In India it was found that dams for irrigation works were
being destroyed by crustaceans boring into the earthworks. There,
too, it was found that the Egret was of enormous value in keeping
these crustaceans in check.
The Egrets in Riverina may yet be wanted for the benefit
of the irrigationist and the farmer rather than for the feather dealer.
The Ibis and other Long-bills or Spoon-bills are voracious feeders
on the grasshopper. On Monaro grasshoppers are a chi&apos;onic curse
with summer, and the Ibis are now comparatively rare for some
reason. I always regard a flock of Ibis on my place as worth a
fair sum of money to me. The misfortune is that the man with the
gun or with the pea-rifle will not only trespass, but will drive away
these birds, after potting one or two for sport (so-called).
I could go on giving instance after instance, and fact upon
fact, to show that the wild or native birds of every country are
there to benefit the farmers, the fruit-growers, and the stock-breeders
but unfortunately, they are destroyed because at times hunger
compels them to steal a chicken or some fruit or because the man
or boy with a gun wants to destroy life.
Mr. Froggatt, our able naturalist, has given many valuable

The &apos;protection of bird life.
addresses on this subject, and he can give evidence that would
show the necessity, on grounds of national economy, to protect our
wild birds.
The sheep-fly is becoming the curse of our great pastoral
industry. Its appearance synchronises with the disappearance of
many of the birds that would keep the fly in check.
I personally have comparatively little loss from sheep-fly, but
all the same I have much trouble in combating it. The Starlings
seem to help to check this plague, yet I know that in other parts
the Starlings are abundant and seem to produce no mitigation.
Investigation on this subject is needed before one can give
any opinion of value. This I do know -- -that on the Snowy River
the insect life that abounds in the air is of the wasp and gnat
species, and these, or some of them, attack blowflies. It may be
said that bird life would destroy these gnats and wasps. So it
happens; yet there seems to be so far no disturbance of Nature's
balance. I am satisfied, too, that the birds prefer the bigger fly
to the swift flying and small gnat.
Rabbit-poisoning is blamed for the destruction of our native
birds. It may be a well-founded blame, yet I am bound to say that
I have seen no dead birds after the poison-cart has been used at
Jindabyne, but care has always been taken so as to bury the baits
well-- using a deep furrow and a heavy covering chain. Dead rabbits
undoubtedly breed the flies, but the offal from rabbits trapped for
market or for skins does the same. Personally, I think that whilst
the rabbits dead and alive have materially contributed to the fly
increase, yet if the bird life of the country were thoroughly protected
we should overcome that increase.
The foxes undoubtedly destroy many birds and have increased
the factors that tend to the extinction of bird life. Still foxes can
be kept down fairly easily if a landowner tries, and the destruction
of foxes should be carried on as part of the day's work.
No effort ever has been made to do the main thing, viz.
to protect the bird life of Australia, and unless it is done this
continent will become a land of plagues that will force attention
to the necessity for obedience to Nature's law preserving the balance
of life in order to permit agriculture and other industries on the

land to be profitably and economically carried on. I need not stress
the subject much further. The immense losses of sheep last year
from blowflies must have cost Australia some millions sterling.
Without doubt the natural enemies of the flies--the insectivorous
birds of Australia--must be looked to as a means to mitigate the
plague. Unless these birds are protected they will continue to
diminish and the plague increase. So with mice destroying grain.
Their natural enemy must be protected or the damage will always
be imminent. The orchardist has many bird friends working for
him, and some bird enemies working against him. The friends
should be known and protected, and even the bird enemies should
be judged charitably before being exterminated.
The legislature could well give time to consider a Bill to
protect our wild bird life.

By Lieut. R. Hamilton Scott.
Altogether, up to the present, I have seen seventy-four different
species which I have recognised, besides several others of which I was
not certain. My first period out here, from September, 1915, to May,
1916, was spent chiefly in the Ypres salient. In this locality I saw
about fifty-nine different birds. I was wounded and came to
England before the Somme battle, and have never had the chance of
seeing that country. I believe that it is a more interesting bird
country than either the salient or where I am now, which is roughly
tnidway between. I have never had the good fortune to see either
Hoopoes or Golden Orioles, which I believe were to be seen in
numbers down there. No bird of particular rarity stands out
amongst those I have seen. I hoped that I might meet some
European birds other than British, but have seen none save the
Crested Lark and one or two doubtful species of Lark or Pipit.
Speaking of European birds, is there a handy book on them ? I
mean such a one as might be brought out here, not a " priceless
copy."
This part of the country is most uninteresting from a bird

point of view. Sparrows (House and Tree), Starlings and Crested
Larks are quite common, Yellow and Corn Buntings are fairly
plentiful, but the commoner British Finches are conspicuous by
their absence. It is months now since I have seen a Robin or Hedge
Accentor, and one rarely sees a Song Thrush or Blackbird. Some
way back, where the country is more wooded, parties of Magpies
are frequent, though not so numerous as at " Wipers," where they
" swarmed" in the autumn of 1915. A solitary Green Woodpecker,
and perhaps a pair of Jays, may be met with. Kestrels seem to
flourish in the trench area, and Little Owls are not uncommon.
Partridges, too, frequent No Man's Land. A pair of Swallows built
a nest on the wood supporting the roof over my horse standings,
and successfully reared a brood of four. Their nest was not more
than 2 ft. above the heads of the horses, but the birds ignored both
men and horses, feeding the youngsters all the while " stables " were
going on.
Here is a note I made at the time of a bird of whose identity I
was not certain : " May 16th.--The song and call-note of a strange
bird heard in the rushes in the swampy ground at Y - ." No bird,
however, was seen, though there seemed a number in different parts
of the marsh.
" May 24th. --Saw one for the first time. A fine bird of a rich
snuff-brown, with lighter breast. Colour not unlike Nightingale,
but appeared a somewhat larger bird. Has persistent and varied
notes. Seems to spend most of its time in the lowest part of the
reeds. May 29th.--Again visited the marsh at V- . There seemed
to be a large number of the Warblers mentioned in previous note.
To-day I was able to observe them more closely. The colour in the
sunshine is a rich snuff-brown, i. e. the back, wings, and tail, the
breast is pale fawn, nearly white at the throat. The birds seen
were perched on the tall dead flower-stems of last year's blooms of
the reeds, and, whilst uttering their short song or calling, they raised
the feathers on the head forming a slight crest. The feathers on the
throat were also raised."
There were a great variety of notes proceeding from the
marsh, and doubtless there were other species there as well. I once
saw a very similar coloured bird, but somewhat smaller, which I

considered was the Common Reed Warbler. The flight of the larger
bird was very straight and gliding, rather like that of the Spotted
Flycatcher. Would this bird be the Greater Reed Warbler
Here is a note on the Crested Lark.
"June 13th.--Closer observation of this species reveals a black
crest and the outer edges of the tail feathers black. There is also,
running across the top portion of the wing, a curved row of black
dots. The breast is also spotted--the centre portion more thickly--
giving the impression of a stripe. The birds which have been seen
closely have either been sitting on the road itself or on the heaps
beside it, and all appeared of a very " dusty " tint. I cannot say
positively, but some similar shaped birds seen flying over some corn
appeared much more ruddy. Whether they are another species 1
am unable to say at present."

AVICULTURAL NOTES FROM THE P.Z.S.

By E. Hopkinson, D.S.O., M.B.
W hen last at home on leave I had occasion to look through
the volumes of the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, and in
the course of so doing came across, as was to be expected, many
papers and notes of great avicultural interest. These seem worth
recalling.
The reference to which I will give the first place has special
interest for me as it has to do with the Gambia, though perhaps it
may not have the avicultural claims of some of the others. On
p. 97 of the 1835 volume we read of a valuable collection of mammals
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.976053657894737" page_id="32704597"  page_num="251" year="" vol="">
on avicultural notes from the P.Z.S. 251
and birds brought home by Kendall, a brother of the then Lieutenant-
Governor of Fort St. Mary and other British possessions in the
neighbourhood. These were described by Ogilby at a meeting of
the Society in July, 1835. Among the birds were Numida rendalli
(described on p. 104), a smaller race of N. cristata, and the Secretary
Bird. The latter is now but a very occasional visitor to the Gambia,
but is, I believe, not uncommon in the neighbouring parts of Senegal,
where the country is more desert-like and more suited to its require-
ments.
The volumes contain numberless breeding records. Of these
an early one is that of Chinese Cranes on p. 369, 1861. Another still
earlier record is that of the successful breeding of Sandwich Island
Geese at Knowsley in 1834.
In the previous year we are told of the breeding of the now
extinct Passenger Pigeon. A pair began to build on April 25th, 1832,
in a tree in their enclosure. The hen was the builder, the cock
collected the materials -- sticks and straw. When he brought these
he " alighted on the back of the female with each fresh supply, so as
not to disarrange any part of the nest which she had formed." The
nest was finished in one day, one egg was laid on the 26th, and the
hen commenced sitting at once. The young were hatched in sixteen
days. The male relieved the female during the incubation period.
Another instance of the breeding of this species is mentioned as
having occurred at about the same time in the menagerie of the
President, i. e. Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby, at Knowsley.
The last living Passenger Pigeons in the Zoo collection were
three presented in 1883. The last of these died in 1889. See note
in the ' Ibis,' 1912, p. 218. The very last survivor of the race died,
after a long life in captivity, only a few years ago in America, I believe
at Cincinnati, but have not the record to refer to at the time of
writing.*
Two examples of hybrid Passenger Pigeon x Turtur risorius
are mentioned (1849, p. 172) as being then in the collection. In the
same place is a note on a hybrid Goura coronata x victorice, which
was hatched on September 24th and lived four days.
Other mentions of hybrids which I noted down were : 1861,

Avicultural notes from the P.Z.S.
p. 44, hybrid Ducks, and 1901, p. 2, the presence in the Zoo of four
hybrid Macaws ( macao x militaris), which were bred at Milan and
were described as the only known Macaw hybrids in captivity.
A note on p. 33 of vol. ii, 1834, gives an early instance of
Humming-birds in captivity. It says that a Mrs. Barnes brought up
from the nest two of the smallest species of Jamaican Humming-
birds. Their food was sugar-water, and they were so tame that they
would fly to and perch on her finger. During the passage to England
one was killed by the cage being thrown down in a storm, and the
other drooped immediately and died shortly afterwards.
In the 1854 volume (p. 24) John Gould described the Turaco
(Musophagci rossce), and showed a drawing and a feather shed by a
bird, at that time alive in St. Helena, in the possession of Lady Ross,
the widow of the late Governor of that island. Another living and
at that time rare bird exhibited by this world-famed bird painter and
writer was a Red-billed Toucan ( Rhamphastos erythrorhynchus),
which came into his hands in 1835. (See 1835, vol iii, p. 21.)
In this volume we also find (p. 79) an account of a Great Auk,
which was taken alive in 1834 off the coast of Waterford, and which
lived in confinement for some months, to be eventually preserved in
the collection of Dr. Buskill, of Waterford. This bird was the subject
of a note by Dr. Thompson, of Belfast, at the Zoological meeting of
June 9th, 1835. According to the ' British Bird List ' of the B.O.U.
(1915), the Great Auk became extinct, as regards the British Islands,
about 1840, this Waterford bird being the last but one to be obtained,
there being evidence to show that a later (and last) British example
was captured on St. Hilda in 1840. Outside the United Kingdom
the last pair were taken alive off Iceland in June, 1844. Eighty skins
and seventy-three eggs are recorded as known to be in existence at
the time of the publication of the List.
Notes of interesting first arrivals are those of (1) the Shoe-bill
\0x25A0(Balceniceps ), on p. 195 of the 1860 volume. This was presented by
Mr. J. Petherick, then Consul for the Soudan, on March 27th of that
year. (2) The Kagu, presented by Dr. G. Bennett in April, 1862
(1862, pp. 84, 107, and a plate, p. 218). (3) The Openbill, first
eceived in 1901 (1901, vol. i, p. 35).

A strange title, perhaps, for an article in an avicultural
magazine ! But I wonder if those who have never done it realise
the wonders of the night. They know the beauties of moonlight,
perhaps, may have even seen the mysterious figure of an Owl flitting
across their path, but what do they know of the dawn and the
wonders that precede it&apos;?
I was on night duty at a Y.A.D. Hospital " somewhere in
Kent " last May, and never shall I forget the joy and beauties of the
early morning. There was a wide verandah running round the
house, and I would slip out every morning to watch the waking
world. Is it a known fact, I wonder, but I noticed the birds always-
woke in the same order ? The first to sound the alarum was a
Lark, who, some time before it was light, would sing a short song,
and then apparently doze off again ; then a Cuckoo in a small copse
near by; after that a pause ; then another Cuckoo would wake
further away--I knew it for another owing to a peculiarity in its
note--followed by a Blackcap; and then a burst of music, as every
bird within hearing broke into his song of praise, as the light slowdy
spread, and gradually the wonders of the mist-shrowded valley came
into view. How those birds sang! Apparently the choir was not
without its leader, for of a sudden it would stop and the choristers
disperse for breakfast, after which every bird was free to sing or not
as he chose. Breakfast never lasted more than half an hour, but the
music was never so intense as before. And so I found one of the
few reasons to be grateful to the authors of this war for showing me
a fresh beauty in Nature. If this meets the e3 r e of any other night
bird, she or he need never be dull if duty ordains a spell of night
work in the month of May.

REVIEW.
THE BIRDS OF BEDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992063696969697" page_id="32704600"  page_num="254" year="" vol="">
We have received a series of photographs of the birds of
Bedfordshire, taken by Messrs. Symonds, of Potton, in that county.
This album is yet another contribution to advanced aviculture, and
a study of its pages is in itself an education.
Turning to the photographs, we note two exquisite King-
fishers perched on a branch over a stream, above whose rapid waters
dangles a leafy canopy. In another picture we see a single bird
basking and watching in the sunshine. Another study shows a
March rookery, with abundant untidy nests in the branches, and the
great birds " blown about the windy skies." We see a Nightingale
perched on a bramble spray near her nest ; a Robin on the ground,
alert and awake, his rounded eye beaming with intelligence ; a portly
Wood Pigeon in an oak ; and a Woodpecker high up on a tree trunk.
In these delightful pages the life of covert and woodland is brought
before us. The shy Reed Warblers cling to the rushes as they
inspect their cup-like nest; the Jay stands for an instant on a broken
stump, tense and still as if stuffed; and the Great Spotted Wood-
pecker pauses on a birch trunk with a writhing caterpillar in his
beak. All the pictures are interesting, and many reach a high level
of excellence.
We would name specially the remarkable study of a King-
fisher rising from the water, jewelled wings aquiver like a giant
Humming-bird ; the pair of Stonechats perched aloft on a bramble,
like sentinels on a watch-tower ; the Woodpecker on the look-out,
his queer head thrust through a hole in a tree-trunk, the very spirit
of the forest ; and the placid, beautiful Turtle Dove brooding on her
nest. Then there are three fluffy, solemn-looking young Kestrels all
in a row, feathered police of the future ; the Moorhen swimming on
the mere; Moorhens " changing duty " at their nest ; and last but
not least the sombre, sleepy Night-jar squatting among the bracken.
Some of Messrs. Symonds' work has appeared in the Magazine,
and all members of the Avicultural Society will readily endorse its
value. G. R.

Dear Dr. Renshaw,-- As to my memoir on the Megapodiidce , I am just now
*expressing it down to Mr. Dudley Le Souef, Director of the Melbourne Zoological
Gardens, who has, with great kindness, offered to make the attempt to have it pub-
lished somewhere for me in Australia. If you would like to say that much in your
magazine, you are quite at liberty to do so. The monograph will print about fifty
*octavo pages, and is illustrated by 44 figures on 21 plates. It describes the habits,
eggs, incubation, osteology, external characters, etc., of all the known mound birds
of the world, including the rare Maleo ; four of tire plates are in colour. I have but
slender hopes that this expensive piece of work will be out in print for at least a
year or two.
Practically I am at the head centre of ornithological activity Irere in America,
and in touch with all the museums in Washington. Should I be able to obtain
any news notes along such lines, pray command me to that end; it will afford me
pleasure to do what I can for you.

Mr. Allen Silver writes: The letters of my friends, Dr. Butler and Mr. Astley
(the latter, to whom I am, at present, indebted for a sight of the Magazine), and
also that by Miss Chawner, interest me with reference to the scarcity or otherwise
of birds. Since leaving hospital I find they are as numerous as usual in Suburbia
(not a great way from Dr. Butler's). The garden has its three species of Tits, two
Thrushes (Song and Mistle), Blackbirds, Starlings, Hedge Accentors, Robins,
Wrens, Greenfinches, Chaffinches, Redpolls, Wood Pigeons, Carrion Crows, Rooks.
Jackdaws, Skylarks, Wagtails. Pipits (Meadow), and Linnets pass over. On
Christmas morning I saw a Lesser-spotted Woodpecker on my largest pear-tree,
which remained some minutes so that I could tell its sex (it being a male), and a
hen Bullfinch, a day or so afterwards, came through. During the last cold snap,
a flock of Wild Geese passed over very low down, apparently making for the coast
waters. This summer in Monmouthshire I saw plenty of birds, and during a brief
s ay in Suffolk recently I saw a pair of Lesser-spotted Woodpeckers, Nut-hatches,
a Hawfinch, a Siskin, any amount of Tits, and several Creepers. Finches seemed
about as usual, but Song Thrushes were distinctly less, as also were Fieldfares
and Redwings. Mistle Thrushes were in full song, and I came across several Pied
and Grey Wagtails, one white, and two or three Kingfishers. Tawny Owls seemed
numerous, and a pair or two of Long-eared were in a plantation near the cottage in
which I stayed. Little Owls seem to have increased almost abnormally the last few
years, and are by no means rare there. Sparrow and Kestrel Hawks were seen,
and several Coot- and Moor- or Waterhen. My friend, Mr. Chas. Row, who lives in
the vicinity, said that he saw the biggest flock of Longtailed Tits he had ever seen
in his life whilst shooting in the woods, and a beater and others told me they seldom
brush " without a " cock " (Woodcock) or two. Snipe are about as usual. Last

winter (1917) from all accounts, killed birds wholesale in that district, and
even Linnets felt it, so that the breeding pairs were less conspicuous; but, taking
it on the whole, nothing has apparently occurred that one could consider disastrous.
Being limited at present to an occasional ride in a vehicle and a short stroll on
crutches, I have been unable to go to the "correct" spots, but quite in or near
the village the birds previously mentioned were generally of frequent occurrence.
I saw and heard Green Woodpeckers repeatedly, and a " rush " of Water Bails were
mentioned to me.
A SPOT-BBEASTED WABBLEB NESTLING.
Dear Dr. Benshaw, -- In my letter published at p. 138 of the Magazine,
mention, amongst other birds which have lost the spotted character in their adult
stage, " many of the Warblers " ; but these birds are everywhere stated as differin
from the true Thrushes in not having the throat and breast spotted in their nestling
plumage (I noted this as the chief distinctive character in my own book on ' British
Birds ! ); well, I have only succeeded in hand-rearing one of our Warblers--the
Sedge-warbler. One example died in its nestling plumage, and one I moulted in
captivity: I preserved the skins of both, and the nestling has dusky spots right
across the front of the breast. I think, therefore, that the statement that the young
of Warblers are devoid of breast-spots requires some modification. It would be
interesting to examine nestlings of other Warblers to see whether the Sedge-warbler
is an exception to the rule. I thought I would make a sketch to show 7 the spotting
on the breast of my nestling Sedge-warbler ; the irregularity of the spots may be an
indication of reversion ; but if so it is none the less interesting. (See p. 235, June,
1918.)
I have three nestling Beed-warblers and their breasts are unspotted.
124, Beckenham Road, Yours very sincerely,
Beckenham, Kent; A. G. Butler.

Mr. C. H. A. Lienau writes : Your Blue Budgerigars must be very beautiful.
I have never seen them nor even heard of there being any in Australia. I have
seen a mention of them in books, but scarcely thought that they really existed.
A few years ago a yellow cock mated up with a green hen, and among other young
ones there were two, one yellow and one green, that only had the markings on the
wings. The rest of their plumage was clear plain yellow and green. These looked
very pretty--at least, I thought so.
In addition to the above I bred early in the season a Zebra-finch Silver-bill
hybrid. This has turned out quite a pretty bird. It more closely resembles the
Zebra-finch in markings, but is devoid of any orange colouring.

WOOD-SWALLOWS.
Our readers will remember the photograph of a White-browed
Wood-Swallow on her nest, the work of Messrs. Lawrence and
Littlejohns, which was issued in our first Anzac number (January,
1918). We now have pleasure in publishing another of this beauti-
ful series, showing not only both parents, hut also both nestlings.
Visitors to the Western Aviary at the Zoo, in former days, often saw
Wood-Swallows in the collection ; their graceful proportions and
pleasing coloration make them very desirable possessions. Concern-
ing another species Mr. Allen Silver has written to us:
" The delightful photo in the January issue, of Artamus sitper-
ciliosus, gave me considerable pleasure, reminding me of a lovely
specimen of A. personatus I once had, whose skin is as perfect in
plumage as in the case of the bird illustrated. It is surprising how
splendid the plumage of this species keeps, even when confined to
comparatively small enclosures. My bird was a great bather, very
tame and cheerful, and cast up pellets of torpedo shape and fairly
large. Somewhere I heard that this was not the case with the ' Blue-
birds,' or ' Summer Martins,' as the Australian lads call them."

Our 10ar aims.
OUR WAR AIMS.
"There&apos;s no reason why we should not have the most popular Magazine
extant, on aviculture in all its branches ."--Extract from Letter to the Editor.
At the Council Meeting held on June 28th the Editor was able
to report to the Council a considerable increase in the popularity and
usefulness of the Magazine. Owing to many able helpers, the Society
flourishes, in spite of the war. Twenty-seven new members have
joined us since November; both the Society's Medal and the Society's
Prize in Literature have been won during the present year. Abroad,
the status of the ' Avicultural ' is everywhere recognised, and our
Magazine is regularly exchanged with leading British and foreign
bird journals; in a list of the great ornithological societies, recently
published by a Transatlantic contemporary, we hold an honoured
place. With all these facts to hand, we may well reflect on our aims
and the best methods of accomplishing them, even in these abnormal
Mines.
First in importance comes our war work--the study of the
food of birds in relation to the crops. This has already been partly
considered, and at a conference to be held later on, the Avicultural
Society will be represented. Here the papers we have already pub-
lished are of considerable value ; aviculture joins hands with economic
ornithology, and journalism with both. Then comes the routine
scientific and popular presentation of bird-study, set forth in the
budget of papers and photographs which month by month find their
way from the Editor's drawer to the letter-boxes of our members.
All these activities require money, and much more of it than formerly,
for their continued progress and well-being.
In order to maintain the high level to which we have attained,
it is necessary to strengthen the financial position of the Society.
This object will be gained if each member will contribute to our
Deficit Fund a small donation--say half a crown, though the Council
is naturally pleased to accept larger sums. AH Donations to be sent
direct to the Publishers, Messrs. Adlard &amp; Son &amp; West Newman, Ltd.,
23, Bartholomew Close, London, E.C.i, and not to the Editor. It will
be a pleasure, we feel, to all our members to help thus in the wide

AUSTRALIAN BLUE WRENS.

<bodyText confidence="0.9974094" page_id="32704613"  page_num="259" year="" vol="">
By C. H. A. Lienau.
I was greatly interested in the article in the May number in
reference to the little Blue Wren.* They are lovely little birds, and
whistle so prettily. We have quite a number here, and several pairs
nest regularly in our garden every season. They are such cheeky
little birds, and hop about on the aviaries, and after whistling awhile
fly off with a shrill chirp, as much as to say " How would you like
to be able to follow me ? "
When I say pairs nest, I feel sure that there are at least
double the number of hens that there are cocks. In one case there
were three nests in the one hedge, and I have watched the one little
cock-bird go from one nest to the other and give each little sitting
hen a tit-bit in turn. The young all hatched at about the same
time, and it was amusing, when the young ones left the nest, to see
the little father hopping across the lawn pursued by no less than
eleven hungry youngsters, all clamouring for a morsel.
Much more uncommon and much more beautiful a bird is, in
my opinion, the Malurus cyanotus, or White-winged Superb Warbler.
They are equally perky, and with the exception of the shoulders, are
a brilliant sapphire blue.

losus), the Bronze Cuckoo (Lamprococcyx plagosus), and the Rufous-
tailed Bronze Cuckoo (L. basalis). All of these species are more
common in the eastern and central districts, during spring and
summer, and occur in the neighbourhood of Sydney, Guculus inornatus
being the nearest approach to a strict migrant, while in very mild
winters a few remain throughout the year, or are absent only for a
short period. Flinder's Cuckoo ( Eudynamis cyanocephala) and
Channel-billed Cuckoo ( Scythrops novce-hollandice) occur principally
in north-eastern New South Wales, but in late summers and in
autumn examples sometimes wander over the contiguous portions of
the State. To this Order also belongs the Pheasant-Coucal ( Cen -
tropus phasianus), locally known as the " Swamp Pheasant," &amp;quot;Swamp
Cuckoo," and the " Lark-heeled Cuckoo." It differs from the true
Cuckoos in constructing a round nest of grass and debris on the
ground, usually lined with eucalyptus leaves, with an aperture on
either side for ingress and egress. The swampy scrubs and brushes
of the northern coastal district are its favourite haunts ; it is, how-
ever, sometimes obtained in the neighbourhood of Sydney, and at
Port Hacking and in the Illawarra district.
The Order Psittaci is fairly well represented in New South
Wales, for out of the sixty species inhabiting Australia and Tasmania
thirty-six are found within its boundaries. In this Order hybrids
often occur, and instances of albinism, partial or total, xanthrochroism,
erythrism, and melanism are frequently met with. Those most
worthy of notice are the different species of the genera Trichoglossus
and Glossopsittcicus in the Lories; Cacatua and Calyptorhynchus in
the Cockatoos; and Platycercus, Psephotus, and Neopliema in the
Parrakeets. Like the Honey-eaters, the hairy-tongued Lorikeets
constituting the Australian members of the Family Loriidse aid in the
pollination of plants and trees, as they feed to a large extent on the
nectar extracted from the blossom of eucalypti and other trees. The
Blue-bellied Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus novce-hollandice), the Scaly-
breasted Lorikeet ( Psitteuteles chlorolepidotus), the Musk Lorikeet
(Glossopsittacus concinnus), and the Little Lorikeet (G. pusillas )
inhabit the coastal and central districts; all but the Scaly-breasted
Lorikeet, which frequents chiefly the north-eastern part of the State,
are generally distributed over these parts. They are at times very

destructive in orchards, especially the Musk Lorikeet. In January
and February, 1896, these birds amounted to a plague in country
districts, and numbers were killed in fruit-trees with sticks and
stones. The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo ( Cacatua galerita ) is familiar
to most bird-lovers in Europe and Britain, as well as in Australia
and Tasmania, for it is in great request as a cage-bird or pet. It is
a remarkably good talker, but is noisy, and, when semi-domesticated,
very destructive to all kinds of woodwork when allowed its freedom ;
in a wild state, in common with the Rose-breasted Cockatoo (C. rosei-
capilla ) and many other species of the Order, it commits great havoc
in grain crops. Except in the extreme portions of the western and
coastal districts, it is generally distributed over the State, as it is at
all times wary and difficult to approach. Precisely the reverse is the
Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus funereus ), somewhat
sparingly distributed in pairs over eastern and central New South
Wales. At Middle Harbour, near Sydney, I have known this species
to be shot in low Banksias. Banks's Black Cockatoo ( C. banksi) is
found in the coastal districts, but not anywhere in the neighbourhood
of the Metropolis; also along the course of the Darling River in
north-western New South Wales. Solander's Black Cockatoo
( C. viridis ) used at one time to frequent the neighbourhood of
Botany, but, of recent years, Port Hacking is the nearest locality to
the Metropolis in which I have known this species to be procured.
It is distributed throughout the greater portion of the coastal districts
and central New South Wales. Black Cockatoos feed largely upon
seeds and kernels extracted from Banksia and Casuarina cones, also
upon the wood-boring larvte of insects. The Red-crested Gang-gang
Cockatoo ( Callocephalon galeatum), an inhabitant of the coastal dis-
tricts and contiguous mountain ranges, is one of the rarest of cage-
birds usually seen in this Order. The Crimson-shouldered Parrot
(Aprosmictus erythropterus), inhabiting northern New South Wales,
and the King Parrot ( A. cyanopygius), distributed throughout the
greater part of eastern New South Wales, are also worthy of notice.

Blue Budgerigars.
BLUE BUDGERIGARS.
By John W. Marsden, F.Z.S.
I am always interested in Dr. Butler's articles, and this month
he refers to Blue Budgerigars. I should like to state a few of my
ideas on their origin, etc., if permitted, in our Magazine. Lately I
have been reading back numbers, and I find in 1900 correspondence
re admitting Canaries into the Magazine (which I should not like i,
and I fear Blue Budgerigars are in the same category.
In an article I sent to June ' Bird Notes ' last year, I said
I bred, after three seasons of selection, from a green hen (\0x25A0S blue,
S green, \ yellow) two very fine blues. Now, it seems to me that
what we should do is to get rid of the yellow in the common
green. If we take the yellow r away from the yellow parts we get
white, and by taking the yellow from the green part we get blue,
because blue x yellow = green, therefore, green -- yellow = blue; so
in using yellow to produce blue I should only use the very palest
and washed-out ones I could possibly get.
As far as I know, the origin of the blue is unknown, but I
think the breeder may have bred an albino, and, in trying to per-
petuate the whites by inbreeding, produced the blues. I may be
wrong, but in any case it seems to me the great thing is to eliminate
the yellow. I cannot help thinking that generations ago the original
colour of the Budgerigar was blue, and the yellow has been developed
as a more protective colour from the sun. Mr. Millsum and the
Rev. J. M. Patterson both agree that blues must be bred and kept
in the shade. In the common greens the nest plumage is more or
less blue, and we know that in all Nature the colour of the young
indicates the original colour of the bird or beast. Then, again, blue
or grey-blue appears to be a primary colour of Nature. Therefore,
it seems quite possible that if Budgerigars w T ere originally blue, the
yellow (a protective colour) came in and produced the green, according
to the rule of the survival of the fittest.
When breeding birds, Mendel's law does not appear to work
out unless the birds are equally prepotent. I should very much like
to know if a pure blue has been bred from a blue and a pure-bred
green ; I have not heard of one. I remember many years ago

Mr. Abrahams showing me the skin of a yellow which he said was
produced by inbreeding, and I think there is no doubt that yellow
was bred this way, but I cannot see that blues are the result of con-
stitutional vigour. I think people who have had blues will agree
with this, and it is much more likely that they are a throw-back to
the original colour, and can only be produced by inbreeding.

Belonging to the Order Limicola, many species will be found
frequenting the sandy beaches and shallow inlets of the coast, also
estuarine areas and contiguous lakes. Among them may be men-
tioned the White-breasted Oyster-catcher ( Hcematopus longirostris),
the Golden Plover ( Charadrius dominions ), the rarer Hooded Dotterel
(.AEgialites cucullata), and the Red-capped Dotterell (JE. ruficapilla).
Near Sydney, about the mud-flats at the mouths of Cook and George
Rivers, and at other parts of Botany Bay, at one season or another,
may be seen the Australian Curlew ( Numenius cyanopus ), the
Eastern Bar-tailed God wit ( Limosa novce-zealanclice), the Marsh
Tringa ( Heteropygia acuminata), and the Grey-rumped Sandpiper
( Totanus brevipes). Further inland are more abundantly distributed,
the Spur-winged Plover ( Lobivanellus lobatus ), the Stone Plover
( CEdicnemus grallarius), the Black-breasted Plover ( Sarciophorus
pectoralis), the White-headed Stilt ( Himantopus leucocephalus), and
the Red-necked Avocet ( Becurvirostra novce-hollandice). In central
and western New South Wales are found the Red-kneed Dotterel
( Erythrogonys cinctus), the Australian Dotterel (. Peltohyas australis),
the Pratincole (StiltiaIsabella), and the Rhynchsea or " Painted Snipe "
( Rhynchcea australis). Latham's Snipe ( Gallinago australis), locally
known to most sportsmen by the name of " Jack-Snipe," a migrant
from Japan, is a visitor at the latter end of August or early in
September, chiefly to the eastern and central districts of the State.
The Order Gavice is chiefly represented by the Marsh Tern
(Hydrochelulon hybrida), the Long-legged Tern ( Gelochelidon macro-

tarsa), more common inland in the central and western districts,
where they breed; the Crested Tern ( Sterna cristata), common in all
the bays and inlets of the coast, and breeding on Cook Island in the
north to Montague Island, which is getting towards the southern
boundary of the State; and the White-shafted Tern ( Sternula sinensis ),
found in the same situations, but more sparingly distributed, breed-
ing in colonies on sand-pits and margins of brackish coastal lagoons.
Fairly common along the coast is the Pacific Gull ( Gabianus pacificus),
while the Silver Gull ( Larus novce-hollandice ) is in evidence in all the
bays and inlets, large colonies of them breeding on Montague Island.
In stormy weather great flocks assemble in grass paddocks contiguous
to the coast, and both species have been observed hundreds of miles
inland. The Pacific Gull is occasionally seen in Port Jackson and
on the Parramatta, and the Silver Gull frequents the shipping in Farm
Cove, on the look-out for sci'aps thrown overboard. It is the most
familiar of all species to ferry passengers in Sydney Harbour.
Between Sydney Heads and Bradley's Head, Richardson's Skua
(Stercorarius crepidatus) is in some years remarkably common.
The Order Tubinares is principally represented by the White-
faced Storm Petrel ( Pelagodroma marina ), the Wedge-tailed Petrel
(Puffinus sphenurus), and the Short-tailed Petrel (P. tenuirostris), the
last being the rarer of the three species, except in some years, when
it appears in countless numbers. The White-winged Petrel (. PEstre -
lata leucoptera), frequenting and breeding on Cabbage-tree Island,
near the entrance to Port Stephens, is of circumscribed range, while
the Giant Petrel ( Ossifraga gigantea ) is occasionally seen.
Although Albatrosses occasionally venture inside Sydney
Heads, and I have observed them as far up as the entrance to the
Parramatta River, New South Wales seas are not by any means a
stronghold of the genus Diomedea , and several of the substantiated
records of the occurrence of certain species on the coast are founded
on a few or single examples. They include the Black-eye-browed
Albatross ( Diomedea melanophrys), the wandering Albatross ( D.
exulans), the Shy Albatross (D. cauta), the Culminated Albatross (D.
culminata), and the Yellow-nosed Albatross ( Thalassogeron chloro-
rhynchus ).
Three species of the Order Pygopodes are generally distributed

paratively very rare, the Hoary-headed Grebe (P. nestor), extremely
common in Western New South Wales, as the Black-throated Grebe

A single representative of the Order Impennes inhabits the seas
of the State--the Little Penguin ( Eudyptula minor). It breeds on
some of the larger islands contiguous to the coast, and may be occa-
sionally seen in Port Jackson, about Manly, the entrance to Middle
Harbour, and Bradley's Head.

Mr. Alfred Thom writes: " Herewith I send further notes on
my Red-naped Lorikeets.
" We were sure we heard young ones in the nest, and at last
I looked in and found one dead, only a day or so old, and no others.
There were no remains of other eggs, though the hen had laid one in
a small cage one day when she looked seedy, and was oiled and put
in a very warm place.
" The cock bites, and one has to be careful in feeding them, as
he goes for you without any fear. They bathed even in the frostiest
weather, generally in the evening, and my aviary gets no sun, so is
very cold. The single hen looks rather unhappy, although she is in
a mixed aviary where she gets plenty of sun, and sees people who
pass in and out of the side door, which interests her.
" I bathed the foot of the Zebra Finch and put a drop of
camphorated oil on twice, and it seems to have quite cured him."

coast district, and the Spotted Bower-bird (Chlamy clod era maculata )
of the drier scrubs and belts of timber and bushes which are dotted
about or intersect the plains of the central and western districts of
the State. The love of the beautiful is always displayed by these
birds in the formation and manner of adornment of their playing-
places, from the primitive bower made by the Regent Bower-bird to
the larger and more compactly built structure of the Spotted Bower-
bird, which is profusely decorated with bones, pebbles, pieces of
glass, fresh-water shells, and seeds ; also, preferably, any bright,
metallic articles, such as nails, capsules, ends of wire, empty metal
cartridge cases, etc., picked up about its haunts or pilfered from
some tent, hut, or dwelling. A single representative of the allied
family, Paradiseidae, in the Rifle-bird ( Ptilorhis paradisea ) inhabits
the northern coastal districts. Its egg is one of the most beautiful
of all the eggs of Australian birds. Equally remarkable, too, is the
Family Menuridaa, all the three species of which are found in New
South Wales. Prince Albert's Lyre-bird ( Menura alberti) occurs in
the extreme north-eastern portion of the State, Queen Victoria's
Lyre-bird (Ilf. Victoria) inhabiting the south-eastern corner, and the
common Lyre-bird i M. superbcc ) New South Wales.
The numerous Family Meliphagidse, or Honey-eaters, over
thirty species of which occur in the State, frequenting chiefly the
forests of Eucalypti, Acacia, Banksia, and Melaleuca, and so well
adapted with their brush-like tongues to secure their food, play an
important part in the pollination of these and other trees and shrubs.
No more beautiful sight could be witnessed by a bird-lover than to
stand in winter beneath some giant " feeding-tree," preferably one of
the Eucalypti, its foliage almost hidden by its large trusses of snowy-
white flowers, and watch the different birds coming and going.
Within a few miles of Sydney one may often see eight to ten species
of Honey-eater feeding on the same tree. At Middle Harbour I
have observed at one time the Fulvous-fronted, White-cheeked,

insects form a large portion of their food, while not a few are
incorrigible fruit-stealers. Among the latter the chief offenders are
the Yellow-faced Honey-eater ( Ptilotis chrysops), the White-eared
Honey-eater (P. leucotis), the Garrulous Honey-eater, or " Soldier-
bird " ( Myzantha garrula), and the well-known Friar-bird, or
" Leatherhead " ( Tropidorhynchus corniculatus), which is very des-
tructive.
The clear, confident, swish-like note terminating in a vigorous
crack of the Whip-bird ( Psophodes crepitans) is more often heard in
the low, dense undergrowth than this wary bird is seen. It inhabits
the coastal districts and contiguous mountain ranges of eastern New
South Wales, and occurs in favourable situations in the outlying
suburbs of Sydney.
To the Family Certhiidse belong the White-throated Tree-
creeper ( Climacteris scandens), the Brown Tree-creeper (C. leuco-
phcea ), inhabiting the open forest-lands and mountain ranges of
eastern and central New South Wales, the Bed Eye-browed Tree-
creeper ( C. erythrops), and the White Eye-browed Tree-creeper (C.
superciliosa), of western New South Wales. The food of these
species, which consists of insects, is obtained chiefly on or under-
neath the bark of trees.
The Family Dicaeidat, with a single representative in Aus-
tralia, has an important action on its flora. The Mistletoe-bird
(Dicceum hirundinaceum) , generally distributed over Now South
Wales, feeds largely on the viscid berries of the Loranthus, which it
passes entire, and thus assists in the distribution of this parasite.
The Order Alectoricles only contains two species. The Aus-
tralian Crane ( Grus australasiana ), widely known all over the
continent as the " Native Companion," at times commits great
havoc, eating the seed on newly-planted grain-fields. The other,
the Australian Bustard ( Eupodotis australis), locally called the
" Plain Turkey," is an inhabitant of the great plains of central and
western New South Wales. It is a most useful bird, feeding largely
upon insects procured on the ground about grass paddocks : ex-
tremely wary, and much sought after for the table.
Of the Sub-class Batitce, one of the two species representing
the Order Casuami in Australia, and inhabiting New South Wales, is

the Emu ( Dromceus novce-hollandice), well known everywhere through-
out the continent, and emblazoned on the Australian coat-of-arms.
This species was first figured in Phillip's ' Voyage to Botany Bay ' in
1789 as the " New Holland Cassowary," and was characterised the
following year by Latham in his ' Index Ornithologicus ' as Casuarius
novce-hollandice, Captain Tench, in his ' Settlement at Port Jackson,'
in 1793, first making us acquainted with its nest, eggs, and young.
Unfortunately its numbers are rapidly decreasing, for does it not
consume grass, thereby endangering the staple product of the State,
break wire fences, and disturb breeding ewes ? -- all unpardonable
offences in the eyes of the pastoralist. Consequently, both birds and
eggs are destroyed in a ruthless manner by men employed for these
purposes; besides, the young birds have other enemies to contend
with in the shape of dingoes.

Mr. C. H. A. Lienau writes :
" The Regent Birds are not very plentiful here now ; they
are most interesting, and those that they have in the Zoological
Gardens here have constructed some wonderful playgrounds. I
really think that the Petilotis &apos;penicillata, or Green Ringneck as it
is commonly known, is by far our most beautiful native songster
among the smaller birds. Of course, the Magpie is easily the best
of the lot. His wonderful flute-like notes ring through the forests,
and can be heard a mile away in calm weather, and yet are not at
all shrill or piercing even when heard at only a few yards' distance.
The Green Ringneck gives us his best song just at sunset. The
notes are wonderfully clear and dulcet, and on a moonlight night
we have heard his song continuously till after midnight, and he
resumes it again at daybreak. As near as it can be syllabalised it
commences 'Won't you drink, pretty creature, won't you drink?'
He is altogether a charming bird, and wonderfully graceful in his
movements."

Society Show, so you will see for yourself. The show is now over ;
I am pleased to say it was a most complete success in every way.
We had 609 entries, which is an easy record. The exhibits, on the
whole, were of a high quality. I got a first and special for the best
Parrot; I won this with a New Guinea White-rumped Lory, and of
all the striking birds he was easily the talk of the show. I got tired
of telling the people what he was and where he came from. Besides
the Lory I showed a Mitchell Lorikeet; he is very nice, but not up
to the Lory; unfortunately he managed to break off the end of his
tail, which put him out of the running. The Masked Parrot is a
very fine tame bird, it ran second at the show ; of course, its not a
patch on the Lory.
The Lory is about half as big again as a Blue Mountain
Lorikeet, and bas such a wonderful blending of various shapes and
colours; he lives chiefly on hemp, sunflower, and fruit. The
Mitchell Lorikeet is a little smaller than a Blue Mountain. I have
got in touch with a man in Hobart, and he sent me a nice little cock
Blue-wing and four pairs of Firetails, all of which are doing nicely."

We deeply regret to report that the incomparable collection
of birds at Villers-Bretonneux has been utterly destroyed in the
recent fighting.
Lieut. Delacour writes : " It was absolutely impossible to get
any bird away. I only know that when the last persons left Villers-
Bretonneux the park was full of artillery and machine guns, and
being shelled very badly. A British Staff Major, who visited the
property later, found nearly all the aviaries blown up and the birds
killed ; some were still alive, but very few--only some big birds such
as Cranes and Ostriches, and some Ducks on the pond. The majority
were killed by shell fire or by starvation. A cock Ostrich before it
died broke the leg of a sergeant."

TROPICAL WILD LIFE IN BRITISH GUIANA *
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.965001433333333" page_id="32704624"  page_num="270" year="" vol="">
Amongst the books which come into the hands of the reviewer
there appear, at ware intervals, works of superexcellent merit, inau-
gurating a new era of research, epoch-making volumes of zoology.
Mr. Beebee and his assistants have given us such a book.
Introduced by a foreword from Col. Roosevelt, this master-
piece chronicles the doings of the Tropical Research Station estab-
lished by the New York Zoological Society at Kalacoon in British
Guiana. Installed in a large two-storied house at the junction of
three great rivers, with a wild hinterland of jungle, the naturalists
set to work to explore this zoological El Dorado, and have chronicled
their results in a volume which rivals the vivid pages of Bates and
Wallace and Waterton. The book is illustrated with a profusion of
good photographs that bring the jungle to one's very fireside, till one
almost hears the shrilling of the tree-frogs and the cries of the Macaws
in the tall mora-trees. Toucan and Trogon, Trumpeter and Tinamou,
Motmot and Macaw fill these pages, together with Doves, Fly-
catchers, Humming-birds, and so forth, till the aviculturist reading
the record sighs in vain for the vanished population of his aviaries.
Two outstanding contributions to science are made by the
writers. First comes an account of the quaint, almost reptilian,
chick of the Hoatzin--perhaps the most interesting of all birds, with
its quadrupedal gait and its uncanny climbing performances, aided
by its fingers and toes. We see the infant Hoatzin crawding on all
fours about the nest; climbing a branch, more like a lizard than a
bird ; helplessly struggling along the ground; or swimming with wings
extended in a basin of water. Then in a section devoted to Toucans

we have an account of the finding of the first recorded egg of the red-
billed species, with a good figure of the egg, and photographs of the
first Toucan chicks ever seen by any naturalist. Very interesting are
these pictures of the hideous little creatures--bald, naked, ungainly,
helplessly squatted on their heel-pads instead of on the soles of their
feet. Next comes an account of various ornithological discoveries,
with details of the nests and eggs of Crake and Ground Dove,
Tyrantlet and Quadrille Bird, Antcatcher and Bush-bird, Manakin
and Honey-creeper, till one seems to have personally undertaken a
bird-nesting foray in the tropical jungle.
Turning to errors, we are surprised to find, on p. 96, the Giant
Cacique ranked as a giant Oriole; had it been styled a giant Hang-
nest it would have been correctly classed--the error being the more
unfortunate, as the species is rightly placed among the Icteridce
in the list on p. 137. We regret to see Icterus chrysocephalus and
I. xanthornus xanthornus also ranked as " Orioles "--a term which
should be restricted to the Old World members of the genera Oriolus
and Sphecotheres* The dead tree in Fig. 48 does not show the
nesting-hole of the Green Aracari or any other Toucan, for it is on
too small a scale for the aperture to be recognised, even with the aid
of a lens. The same applies to Fig. 54, for the blackened knot-hole
mentioned in the text is quite invisible in the photograph. The
account of the nestling Hoatzins includes no reference to the presence
or absence of the pelvic wing, though in so archaic a form one would
have thought that this would have been one of the first characters to
be looked for.
In spite of these drawbacks, the book is a fine piece of work
it represents American zoology at its best, and that is very good
indeed. G. R.

By Hubert D. Astley.
If no one else congratulates me, at any rate I pat myself on
the back at having a brood of five Queen Alexandra Parrakeets
(Spathopterus alexandrce), which have left the nest. There were six,
but the baby of the lot died owing to being too small to reach up to
the aperture of the nesting-box, when the mother no longer went in,
but perched outside to feed them, and so the larger ones evidently
trampled the poor little bird down. 1 had begun to fear that my
stock of these rare and beautiful Parrakeets would die out, for since
I left Benham Valence five years ago, they had not nested ; in fact
there have been no young for certainly six years from the same old
birds. I notice--I forget whether I did so on previous occasions--
that the pink throat of the nestlings extends slightly on the breast
in the form of edgings to the grey-green feathers, which scalloping
does not appear in the adult plumage. The males can be distin-
guished by a patch of dull mauve on the forehead, and by a larger
area of pink on the throat, which is also of a brighter colour than in
the females. The five young are exceedingly vigorous, and the
mother feeds them when I am standing close to them, so close that
their tails brush against my coat. It is astonishing how quickly she
can fill their crops, for so little food seems to be regurgitated at each
feeding.

(&apos;Concluded from p. 192.)
One of the largest Cuckoos in the world's avifauna is the
Giant Cuckoo, also known as the Channel-bill, Storm Bird, Hornbill,
and Toucan. Dr. Leach, of Melbourne, in his ' Australian Bird Book,'
says of it that " it is a northern bird, which very rarely reaches
the southern part of the Continent. Its large bill is characteristic.
Its tail is large and often spread out fan-wise, thus giving a majestic
appearance to the bird. Its call is not pleasing, as it is described by
Gould as a ' frightful scream,' and again as consisting of ' awful
notes.' It lays its eggs sometimes in the nest of a Sparrow Hawk
(not Kestrel), or in the nest of a Magpie, Bell-Magpie ( Strepera ), or
even a Crow. It appears with the first flood-waters, and follows the
rivers from the Gulf of Carpentaria water-shed down to Cooper's
Creek and Lake Eyre" (pp. Ill, 112).
Mr. Wood's mounted specimen of this bird, for animation
and naturalness, is quite perfect. The label on the specimen gives
its range as "Australia, New Guinea, to Flores, and Celebes." If a
second specimen is ever mounted for this Museum, it should be done
with the tail spread in its characteristic manner, as described by
Dr. Leach.*
* [Similarly a figure of the Road-Runner Cuckoo, with tail spread out fanwise, will
be found in ' Bird Lore,' Vol. xvii, No. 1, p. 59. -- G. R-]

An Old Australian Bird Lover,
A couple of Mr. Wood's Pigeons are here introduced ; they
are by no means the best he has done, though they are excellent of
their kind. I shall publish others elsewhere -- perhaps in Australia.
The beautiful species to the left of the picture is a male of the White
Nutmeg Pigeon of Australia, New Guinea, Papuan, and Aru Islands.
It is here represented in an extremely life-like pose, and it is by no
means difficult to imagine its being alive. This also applies to the
superb specimen of the Papuan Imperial Pigeon, to be seen on its
perch to the right. That is a New Guinea species -- a large form,
with a build much like the extinct American Passenger Pigeon.
[We have much pleasure in publishing the photograph
annexed to this paper, demonstrating, as it does, the high level
attained by the American taxidermists. Equally with painting and
sculpture, taxidermy should rank as a fine art, as far removed from
mere " stuffing " as a Penguin is from a Humming Bird. The
wonderful life-like pose of both birds leaves nothing to be desired,
and it is here that the knowledge of living birds promoted by avi-
culture is invaluable. Had so-called " illustrators " always worked from
live models there would never have existed those grotesque figures
which still disgrace the pages of too many books. -- G. R.]

Recently, Mr. J. E. Ward arrived from New Guinea with a
large and varied collection of this wonderful country's birds, each
of them a treasure in itself. To see them makes one long to have
them all in one's aviaries. There were not only a large number of
Birds of Paradise, such as the Great, the King, the Six-wired, the
Magnificent, the Superb, and the Long-tailed, but also six specimens
of the " Blue Bird " species (Paraclisornis rudolphi )--the largest
number ever brought alive out of New Guinea by any collector.
There were also beautiful Parrots of all colours, Pigmy Parrakeets in
blue, yellow, black, and white; different species of Rails (some
looking like Sparrows on stilts) ; gorgeously coloured fruit-eating and
some seed-eating Pigeons not much bigger than Starlings. Further,

some lovely Wrens and other soft-billed birds, New Guinea Finches
of the Nun type, and a new species of Chestnut Finch. The Golden-
crested Bower Birds were worth special mention, and the gems of
the collection were the Long-tailed Kingfishers and wonderfully-
coloured Pittas. Of minor importance, though attractive enough
were the Red-eyed Glossy Starlings, Quails, and Minahs, and various
others I cannot just now remember. Besides birds, Mr. Ward
brought a new species of Wallaby and a collection of reptiles, which,
by their wonderfully vivid colours aroused the admiration of even
those who are less friendly inclined towards snakes and lizards. I
asked Mr. Ward to tell me how he procures his birds, and he was
good enough to do so and give me permission to relate some of his
observations and experiences in the ' Avic. Mag.' This is what he
told me :
Port Moresby is generally the place where the outfit for an
expedition into the interior of New Guinea is procured. A collector s
licence has to be obtained, as well as a special licence for the taking
of Birds of Paradise, dead or alive. The fees for both are about #25,
and the number of Birds of Paradise permitted to be taken are stated
on the licence. As one cannot leave British New Guinea except
via Port Moresby the conditions of the permit are strictly enforced,
and an official counts the birds before they are allowed to leave the
country. Around Port Moresby, in fact within days of it, nothing
of value in birds could be caught. The collecting grounds are far
away, along the Agabung River, the Fly -- or St. Joseph's -- River,
which are reached via Yule Island. As one travels inland there are
localities met with, as in Australia, devoid of natives and birds,
simply because there is nothing to eat for either -- it is desolation.
To cross these districts with a transport of birds, the food for which
has to be gathered on the way, is a very trying matter.
The King Bird of Paradise and the Great Bird of Paradise are
the first to be met with in the sultry river flats, and to obtain them
is comparatively easy. Mr. Ward says the catching of the Great
Bird of Paradise is quite a religious ceremony with the natives, and
although he tried hard during his several visits to be allowed to be
present he never succeeded in seeing one caught. The men whose
job it is to catch them must not eat meat for days prior, besides con-

An Old Australian Bird Lover,
forming to minor regulations. After having absented themselves
from the village the women will carry their food (taro and bananas),
leaving it on the track unseen by the men. The birds are caught in
their dancing-tree with snares, the most favourable method being a
double slipknot placed around a limb of the branch of the tree in
such a way that when the bird gets his foot into the noose the cord
tightens on to it, and releasing itself from the branch leaves the
bird dangling. Another way is to spread a fine meshed net a little
below the dancing birds, which, when frightened, will fly downward
towards the under scrub and thus become entangled in the net.
The Six-wired also dances, and like the Magnificent performs on a
ledge on the ground. The Long-tailed Bird of Paradise dances on
vines which spread from tree to tree, using them in the same way as
children would a swing. The natives, knowing the bird's dancing-
vine, build a little hut or shelter close by, and when the bird dances
and is unconscious of its surroundings they grab it by the tail, the
feathers of which are so tightly wedged into the body that they with-
stand the struggles which follow.
Mr. Ward got his Blue Birds of Paradise 6000 ft. high in
very hostile country, and says the natives there are the most super-
stitious he ever met with in New Guinea. Whilst he was able to
make himself understood amongst the tribes lower down in the Motu
language, a sort of Esperanto in New Guinea, he found here the
greatest difficulties, and even his interpreter left much to be desired.
To make the natives understand the kind of bird he wanted he drew
and painted the Blue Bird, noting the exclamations of the natives
when they saw it. In this wise he learned the native name for it,
being " Manika." He stayed in this village for several weeks, but
neither presents of tobacco, knives, tomahawks, nor the much-valued
of all, " salt," could induce the natives to catch the much longed-for
Blue Bird for him. Eventually, he decided to make use of their
superstition, and coiling a large snake around his neck, walked
through the village. He tells me that the effect of this trick upon
the natives was most comical. The street emptied itself as if by
magic, no native being visible. He then instructed his interpreter to
tell them that the snake was his brother, and that he had decided to
depart but leave his brother behind, and as he had many cousins he

on how Birds of Paradise are caught. 277
would call them all, and the village would be alive with them because
his brother was very angry that they had taken his presents and not
caught him any Blue Birds ! He evidently succeeded beyond expec-
tations, for a day or two after the first pair of Blue Birds arrived,
being followed within a few days by another eleven ! Unfortunately,
the natives are very cruel in carrying the birds they bring in, tying
them tightly by the thick part of the leg to poles with head down-
ward ; when resting they are just pitched anywhere, so that a
number are half or quite dead on arrival. Mr. Ward considers that
the Blue Birds are not at all rare, but being a kind of sacred bird it
is hard to induce the natives to catch them. Other birds, especially
those of bright plumage, the feathers of which they use themselves
in their dancing costumes, they will readily bring in in any number.
In this altitude Mr. Ward also obtained his "Superbs " and " Long-
tails " without trouble. As far as he could observe, the King Bird is
the only one which does not dance or perform in some way. Parrots
and Pigeons are very plentiful, and form the main item on the menu.
The natives catch them with snares and bring as many as required
for small remuneration.
One of the most interesting birds is the Golden-crested Bower
Bird, which is taken in the net. The bower of this bird by description
must be most remarkable. A straight little sapling perhaps 2 ft.
high is selected, and in some way the bird kills it and strips it of
its leaves. Then he will plant in a circle around this little flagpole,
in the shape of a little mound, moss, which in this ever moist and
steamy atmosphere grows very quickly. He will then place a dead
stick from the outer rim of the mound against the upright, and build
a network of little sticks up the upright and the lean-to stick,
leaving an opening on the mossy mound through which he plays.
One of the most common birds of New Guinea is a gorgeously
plumed, long-tailed Kingfisher. Little hoys catch them any time
they want to, taking the half-curled bark of a banana tree, and
fastening a grasshopper into the centre. Two or three inches
each side of it they fix a snare with the noose upright inside the
bark. Having located the bird, they put their trap on the ground
close by, and clapping their hands so as to attract the attention of
the bird, they walk backward away. The bird invariably swoops

down in a half-circle, and if he is not caught on his way to the
grasshopper, he generally finds himself in the noose getting away
from it. To catch these birds, which get their food on the wing, is
one thing, to keep them is another. Mr. Ward, after losing scores
of them for want of live food, conceived the idea of bleaching the
flesh of pigeons--the only meat available--and getting the natives to
hunt up some white grubs, such as are found in decayed wood. He
commenced by tying small pieces of this bleached meat on to the
white grubs. Each day the grub became smaller, the piece of meat
bigger ; eventually there was only the still-moving head and the meat
attached. In the end even the head went, and Mr. Ward was repaid
for his infinite trouble and perseverance by bringing a number of these
lovely birds, living on meat, to Sydney--probably the first seen alive
out of New Guinea.
Altogether, the food question for birds during transport must
have been very trying; in many districts Mr. Ward could only get
green bananas, and the artificial food brought along would go sour
an hour after opening the air-tight tins. Also the trouble he had
with his carriers, especially in hostile country, needs remembering,
and would dishearten anyone less enthusiastic or energetic. On
account of their quarrelsomeness, many of his birds had to be trans-
ported in separate cages ; others would fight through the bars of
their cages and destroy or maim each other, and as the native track
through this endless jungle is but the width of a man, the cages
would bump against any obstacle -- little would it trouble the natives
if these valuable birds suffered or not. From a height of 6000 ft., up
mountains and down paths almost perpendicular, over ridges sharp
as razors with a consignment of rare and valuable birds, eventually
landing them in wonderful condition -- one might say almost ready
for showing---is an achievement of which anyone might be proud.
It is only the few of us--like the writer of this article -- who have
traversed an inhospitable country similar to New Guinea, suffering
the terrors of the tropical jungles, and that scourge of all tropical
countries--malaria--who realise what it means to collect live birds
in the virgin forests. Sick or well, the birds have to be fed and
watered, yet how many of us--the lucky possessors of tropical bird
treasures -- realise what hardship and bodily misery it may have cost
the collector to obtain the specimens we now admire in our aviaries ?

(Caretaker's diary, communicated by Sir Wm. Ingram.)
October 22nd, 1917.--As usual I went out this morning, and I
saw a good many birds on my way. I am watching carefully, but
up to now I have not seen any sign of nest-building.
24th. -- In making my rounds to-day I saw many birds, cocks
as well as hens. They are Hying in pairs ; I take it as a sign that
they are mating.
November 7th.--I made a round of all the roads to-day. I
had the pleasure of seeing many birds wherever I passed. I again
noticed that they are in couples, flying very low; up to now I have
not seen anything of nest-building.
8th.--I saw a bit of stick in one of the hen bird's beak. It
flew away with it. I failed to see just where it went. I shall, how-
ever, keep a sharp look-out about the locality in the hope of seeing
something of nest-building.
19th. -- I made a general round to-day. I met many birds
all where I passed, but they are in couples. I again saw another
bird with a bit of straw in its beak ; it flew with it to a tall tree, and
I lost sight of it. I have also noticed there is a difference in their
cry now.
20th.--In making my rounds to-day I noticed that very few
hen birds are about; in fact, I only saw two for the day. The
cocks are all about, but particularly in their old stand -- the Parrot
apple-tree.
[Note by Sir William Ingram . -- This is the tree where the
male birds assemble to go through their dancing performances. In
New Guinea the Apodas also have one special tree in each district,
where they go through their display.]
21st. -- From early morning I have been out trying to see if I
can locate a nest, but with no success; the hen birds that could guide
me are not about as usual. I take it that they must be sitting.
22nd. -- I made a general round to-day to see if I can come

across any hens, but I again failed. I saw many cocks wherever I
passed.
23rd. -- I saw a few cocks to-day, and one hen ; she had a bit
of grass in her beak, with which she flew away to a tree. I saw no
more.
29th.-- In making my rounds to-day I met as many as nine
cocks, but not one hen.
30th. -- Again to-day I have not seen a hen bird. I met a
few cocks ; even the cocks I notice are not as common as they were
before.
[Note by Sir William Ingram. --After this he reports having
seen no hen until on December 18th he notes having seen one hen
in the act of mating with a cock bird.]
December 19th. -- I saw three hen birds for a very short time.
20th. -- I saw three hen birds to-day but just for a few minutes,
and they were off. The cocks are everywhere.
21st. --I saw another hen mating, the only hen I have seen
to-day.
29th. -- Have been away from the island during Christmas
week.
[Note by Sir William Ingram. -- In New Guinea, judging from
travellers' accounts, Birds of Paradise breed during November and
December, so it seems my Apodas have not altered their habits in
this respect. I think there is little doubt that they are increasing;
as the Apoda only lays one or two eggs in a sitting it is not to be
expected that their number will be added to very rapidly. It seems
strange that up to the present not one of their nests have been dis-
covered. Prom what I have heard, in New Guinea they nest in
trees about 15 ft. from the ground, so it is likely they choose high
trees in Little Tobago for this purpose. My caretaker further reports
that he saw several young ones from January 5th to the end of
February. This is the time one would expect young Paradise Birds
in New Guinea.]

" Le manucode a douze filets."-- Audebert and Veillot on the Twelve-wired
Bird of Paradise.
The colour changes which occur in birds as the result of cap-
tivity are very puzzling ; one might rather call them colour degenera-
tions, for the new hue seems, as a rule, a poor substitute for the old.
Thus one finds that the Nonpareil loses its rich red colour, this being
replaced after the first moult in captivity by orange, or even yellow.
The gorgeous scarlet Ibis gradually pales in captivity; Linnets lose
the crimson patches on head and breast. Such is also the case--in
this country--with that ornithological gem, the Twelve-wired Bird
of Paradise.
The Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise (Seleueides nigricans ) is
remarkable for its amazing beauty. Even in a dried skin the glorious
metallic hues delight the eye of the naturalist, but to appreciate them
fully one must see the living bird. In the adult male the head is
bronze purple, with the throat and mantle bronze green; the wings
and tail are lovely purplish violet. In addition, there are three sets
of the accessory plumes so usual with this group of birds--namely,

filaments, from which the species takes its name. The female, in
contrast to so much splendour, is soberly garbed in brown.
Unfortunately, this brilliant coloration is liable to become
impaired in captivity; the golden yellow Hank-plumes, which in the
wild bird contrast so handsomely with the violet wings, are liable to
bleacb to a dull yellowish white. One would at first be disposed to
attribute this remarkable phenomenon to exposure to light, as a
similar bleaching is seen in museum specimens which have not been
stored in cabinets. It appears, however, that those kept alive by
Heer van Bruijn Morris retained their normal hue; these were at
Ternate in the East Indies, and practically in their native air, so
probably the bleaching seen in Europe is due to lower vitality caused
by change of climate.

Another interesting fact is not generally known: the lovely
violet colour of the icings appears by a gradual change in the feather
and not by a moult. Thus the colour change is strictly comparable
to that of Bishop Birds and Whydahs, where one can trace the
gradual darkening of an individual feather from day to day. The
feather is, indeed, a living entity, an organism to itself--unlike a
claw, which is merely so much horn. A microscopical examination
of a bleached plume of this Paradise Bird would probably show that
the loss of colour is due to the formation of small air cavities, the
air, so to speak, replacing the imperfectly formed pigment in the
finer structure of the feather. At any rate, such changes are known
to take place in the human subject, and thus produce the silvery
appearance of white hair.
Perhaps the first aviculturist to keep the Twelve-wired Bird
of Paradise was Mr. A. A. Bruijn; writing to Dr. Sclater in 1874 he
stated that in his aviary he had four species of Paradise Birds,
including the present one. This was in the East Indies ; next came
Mr. van Bruijn Morris, who in 1883 had a large collection of Papuan
birds, including two full-plumaged males of the Twelve-wired species.
These did very well in confinement, and their brilliant coloration has
already been alluded to.
In Europe the Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise has always been
very rare--in fact, practically unknown to aviculture. The first one
seen in Europe was probably Signor G. E. Serruti's bird; this the
owner presented to the King of Italy, who kept it alive for several
months. On March 19th, 1881, Mr. Win. Jamrach deposited in the
Zoo three Paradise Birds--all species of great interest--namely, one
Twelve-wired and one Eed, together with a Green Manucode. All
were healthy, but in rough condition ; the Twelve-wired lived till
February 8th, 1882, when he died of congestion of the lungs.
Lastly, a fine male example from Salwatti, purchased by the
Zoological Society on June 8th, 1907, adorned the small bird house
in the Gardens till his death in the spring of 1918. The writer
frequently studied this exquisite creature, and it was the greatest
possible pleasure to note his fine condition, amply testifying to the
care lavished upon him. veteran among Paradiseidce, to the writer
at any rate he showed no signs of age ; his demeanour was alert and

inquisitive, and well supported the dictum of those ornithologists who
place the Paradise Birds between the Crows and the Starlings. In
psychical as in physical characters the bird seemed midway between
the two ; in diet--oranges, figs, dates, meal-worms -- he inclined to
the Starling's side ; one wonders if, like a Starling, a Bird of Paradise
could be taught to talk.
Colours of bare areas during life: eye, bright red; lores, dull
leaden ; legs, pale red ; feet, very pale flesh colour; claws, greyish ;
inside of mouth and dorsum of tongue bright emerald green--
perhaps the most amazing tint of all.

A member's correspondent, writing on Uvsean Parrakeets, says :
I cannot allow that hemp destroys their digestive organs ; surely
seed of any sort would not harm the digestive organs of hard-billed
Parrots; a too liberal supply of hemp or sunflower may over-
fatten them, and thus prove fatal. While with me they had daily
a liberal supply of canary seed and a little hemp, also whole maize
and fruit, green food, etc. ; but before I got them they had been fed
entirely on maize. There is an abundance of wild fruits all the year
round in New Caledonia, so I conclude they need a liberal daily
supply of it and green food, which I always gave them.

By E. Hopkinson, M.B., D.S.O.
In a note to a paper by Bowdler Sharpe on a few birds from
the Ellice Islands [' Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' 1878,
p. 274], the Rev. S. J. Whitmee, a missionary in the Pacific, writes
on one of the very last birds one would expect to hear of in captivity
as follows :
" The Frigate-bird ... is domesticated by the natives
(of the Ellice Islands), and when I was there in 1870 I saw

scores of them about the villages sitting on long perches erected
for them near the beach. The natives procure the young birds
and tie them by the leg and feed them till they are tame.
Afterwards they let them loose and they go out to sea together
to get their food and return to their perches in the villages at
intervals."
Some little time back, before I had come across the above, I
had heard a slightly different version of the same from a friend of
mine, much of whose life had been passed in the Solomons, Gilberts,
and other little-known Pacific Islands. In many places he had often
seen captive Frigate-birds, but in one particularly isolated island or
group the natives had got as far as using these birds as postmen !
These islanders were dependent for the little outside trade they had
on very occasional (sometimes at intervals of two or three years)
arrival of trading schooners. These never made the islands under
ordinary circumstances, as they were so remote from the usual
routes and also so poorly furnished with the usual matters of trade,
but would no doubt do so " if sufficient inducement offered," as the
steamer announcements put it. One of the places which the traders
regularly visited happened to include a nesting-site of the Frigate-
birds. It was by means of this that our islanders (I believe they
were part of the Ellice group, but am not sure) communicated with
the outside world. Just before the nesting-season they caught a
certain number of birds to whose legs they tied bladders ; after
which they let them go. The bladders contained pieces of stone,
stick, shell, etc., which constituted the message. This always
referred to the amount of " trade" (copra, pearl-shell, or whatever it
was) ready for removal. As far as my informant knew, no more
personal news was sent, at any rate nothing written, for that was an
art beyond them. In due course the birds repaired to their breeding-
place. Here any would-be visitor caught any bladder-bearing bird
he saw, and no doubt decided from the news thus brought whether
it was worth his while making the journey to their place of origin.
That it would be easy to catch the nesting-birds is obvious, but how
the first captures were managed is by no means so clear. If they
were caught just before the breeding-season, they must then
have been full-winged. This point never struck me till I read the

missionary's note; his were caught young, and tins may have been
the case with the others also, but even so, where were they caught ?
It could not have been at the breeding-place, for then there would
have been no need for the employment of the birds as messengers,
for the message itself could have been left by the catchers, and had a
more certain chance of meeting the eye of the proper recipient. The
whole point of the need for the birds was the remoteness of the
islanders in question and the single breeding-place which was used
by every bird for hundreds of miles round.
Like these Frigate-birds I have wandered far afield. With
them, as I have come to the end of my notes, I will end, and like
them, may I leave a message of the unbounded store of interesting
matter these ' Proceedings of the Zoological Society ' contain ? My
jottings are merely scraps picked up here and there, and there is
plenty of room for further search and a goodly supply of avicultural
titbits, as well as more substantial proverfder, left for others on some
future occasion, when I am once more within touch of libraries and
books. This is written in the Gambia, far away from all such
things, and to that and to the fact that it is based on rough pencil
notes made at home and brought out with me, any errors in the
references given must be attributed. My writing is never very clear
at the best of times, and it was by no means at its best in these
notes, nor has the packing improved their legibility, or, as I should
rather say, diminished their illegibility.

By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
I must revert to a matter which has long interested me, and
respecting which ornithologists disagree. In Darwin's ' Descent of
Man,' second edition, p. 599, the author makes the following state-
ment : " Some male birds . . . become more brightly coloured
in the spring, not by vernal moult, but either by an actual change
of colour in the feathers, or by their obscurely-coloured deciduary
margins being shed."
In the ' Ibis ' for July, 1916, pp. 476-478, I described the

Colour change without a moult.
assumption of summer plumage in Pyromelana oryx, in confirmation
of the late Dr. Arthur C. Stark's and my own published declaration
that in the genus Pyromelana all plumage which does not require
alteration in form and size for purposes of ornamentation gradually
assumes the nuptial colouring without a moult, and I pointed out
that in the example which I was describing, and which died during
the change, a considerable part of the plumage was in a transitional
condition between winter and summer colouring, in many of the
feathers the brown winter colouring, with heavy blackish shaft-
streaks being washed over with the more or less reddish orange of
the summer hue. If feathers are moulted out and replaced by new
ones of a different colour, the change must necessarily be abrupt;
and, as I have argued years ago, when describing the development
of the adult colouring in the Yellow-hilled Cardinal ('Proc. Zook Soc.,'
1903, vol. ii. pp. 350, 351), it would require not one but a constant
succession of moults to represent all the changes through which these
tropic feathers pass.
At the end of my paper the Editor inserts the following note :
" The example of Pyromelana oryx, referred to by Dr. Butler, is now
in the British Museum, and does not, in our opinion, or that of
others who have examined it, warrant the conclusion that the colour-
change is brought about by the absorption of fresh colour by the old
feathers. Both it and other examples, especially one collected
by Mr. Swynnerton, in Pthodesia, in November (reg. no. 1911, 5. 30.
394), show undoubted signs of moult."
Now, nobody has yet called in question the fact stated by
Stark that " the feathers of the lower back, rump, and flanks are
entirely changed by a moult " ; what they, many of them, refuse to
believe is his further statement, " the remaining plumage and bill
becoming darker, owing to a gradual absorption of colouring matter."
(' The Fauna of South Africa,' Birds, vol. i, p. 131) ; yet Stark is by
no means the only careful observer of birds in their native haunts
who has expressed his faith in colour-change without a moult.

THE FEATHER AS A LIVING UNIT.
By Allen Silver.
Concerning the much debated point of feathers being "stop-
cocked " when once complete, one is hardly in a position to make
assertions on the point without having living birds under close exam-
ination. Eliminating colour appearances, variable according to the
aspect in which the bird is viewed or caused by feather arrangement,
how is it that a freshly moulted bird is nearly always paler than it
was before the moult? Allowing time for the full growth of feather
and the slight abrasion which takes place in some cases ; by the
breeding season the colouring is always (if the bird is in health)
appreciably different in tone, including birds which have not a
special breeding dress. How is it that one of the first signs of real
illness and also of prospective moult is dulness, a dulness similar to
that assumed by human hair, which in some cases is peculiarly
noticeable when certain individuals are "off colour"? The birds
may wash and preen, but there is no polish, no tone; and this is
probably due to the fact that at such times mentioned there is a
permanent "cut off." Again, too, I have noticed, apart from
feather arrangement, prismatic, structural, or metallic colouring,
that dead feathers have not quite the tone of those attached to the
living bird, even before one can bring in the argument of rapid
decomposition. My observations on most newly acquired plumages
causes me to describe them as " mealy " in tone, and those about to
be shed, or on sickly birds as dull and toneless, as compared with the
richest period of their growth.

Report of Council Meeting.
Letters of regret for non-attendance from Mr. Astley, Dr.
Butler, Mr. Shore-Baily, Mr. St. Quintin, and Mr. Willford were
read. A letter of thanks from the British Museum, for numbers of
the Magazine presented, was read.
It was decided to subscribe 7.s. 6rZ. to have a notice of the
Avicultural Society inserted in the Official Year-Book of Scientific
Societies.
It was decided that members might bring friends who were
non-members to the annual tea and garden party.
The Hon. Secretary reported that since the beginning of the
current year twenty-six new members had joined, and only one had
resigned.
To meet the increased cost of producing the Magazine it was
decided to ask every member to give 2s. 6d., or more if possible, to
strengthen the financial position of the Society.
The Editor reported that a very satisfactory amount of copy
was being sent in ; unfortunately, owing to temporary reduction of
the size of the Magazine, publication of some of it would be delayed.
The Hon. Secretary was instructed to write and convey to
Lieut. Delacour a vote of condolence on the destruction of his birds
and aviaries during the war.
Dr. J. Iv. Butter (proposed by Dr. Renshaw) and Lieut. G.
Gurney (proposed by Mr. Meade- Waldo), were elected to fill vacancies
on the Council. Mr. Ogilvie Grant retired from the Council, and was
appointed scrutineer, Mr. St. Quintin being elected auditor.
The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to the Zoological
Society for the kind loan of the room.
After the meeting the annual tea and garden party was held,
tea being provided in the Fellows' Pavilion. According to time-
honoured custom, the afternoon terminated with a tour of the
aviaries in the Gardens. The Small Bird House, with its Birds of
Paradise, was inspected, and there was a fine show of Weavers in
the Summer Aviary.

THE TURNING TIDE.
" Prospice, aspice, respice," ran the old Roman saying--" Look
at the future, look at the present, look at the past." In this spirit,
on the conclusion of the present volume with the present number,
the Society may well pause--and rejoice--to take stock of the
situation. The Council is to be congratulated, for at the meeting
last week " eclipse plumage " was laid aside. Once more we go
forward. The size of the Magazine is increased with this number,
and a further addition of pages will be made in due course. " The
worst is over."
Reverting to our proverb, the past is already recorded in
these pages. As for the present, the Editor warmly thanks his
contributors for their most valuable assistance, both with papers
and photographs. The scope of the Magazine has widened, the
influence of the Society has increased, its policy is known the world
over; still truly avicultural in the widest and best sense, it is not
limited to the mere study of cage-birds, but has taken its rightful
place among the zoological activities of the world.
It is very gratifying to note the latest phase in which the
generosity of our contributors is impelling them to defray the cost
of illustrating their articles. In this way they greatly benefit the
Illustration Fund, so that we can increase not only the amount of
letterpress, but even the number of plates in each issue.
The annual subscription to the Magazine will in future be #i
(one pound).

The Counci! request that all subscriptions for the coming year*
now due, be sent in not later than November ist. The subscriptions
should be sent direct to the Treasurer, Mr. A. Ezra, no, Mount
Street, London, W. i--not in any case to the Publishers. The old
rule is now abolished.
The Council and Editor do not receive any salary, and are
busy with their usual occupations. It will therefore much gratify
them and be a real appreciation of their labours if the subscriptions
are sent in promptly. To seize the magnificent opportunities at last
within our grasp early action is imperative.
The future is full of hope--nay, expectation--and crowded
with grand possibilities. On the threshold of a new volume the
Magazine doffs its eclipse plumage--
" As those
Dull-coated things, that making slide apart
Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns
A jewell'd harness, ere they pass and fly."

By M. Pierre Amedee Pichot.
Most wild animals can readily he tamed, but very few have
become reliable domestic auxiliaries, so that one is led to believe
that if our actual domestic stock is derived from the wild fauna of
the globe, the gradual transformation must have begun in very
remote ages, when man was not diverted from the creatures he
reclaimed by social business and necessities. Adaptation to new
surroundings cannot be obtained without perseverance through many
generations, otherwise the experiments die out with the originators
of the scheme, and all the work has to be undertaken anew.
Thus it happens that many animals and birds, naturally
disposed to accept our control and to avail themselves of the benefits
of domestication, have retained their wild character and are still
totally unfit to realise our expectations.
The fact is particularly noticeable in the class of gallinaceous
birds, which seem better disposed than any to join the human com-
munity and profit by civilisation. It is now several centuries since

the Common Pheasant was introduced into England and France, and
though it has been reared in close contact with man, Waterton's
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9835318" page_id="32704661"  page_num="291" year="" vol="">
saying still holds good: " That notwithstanding the proximity of
the Pheasant to the nature of barn-door fowl, it has that within it
which baffles every attempt on our part to render its domestication
complete."
The character of the Eared Pheasants of Manchuria is still
more puzzling. They seem to prefer human society to that of their
congeners. They will find, as soon as hatched, the door of the kitchen
or the servants' hall, and there they will linger the whole day long,
hardly moving out of the way of a passer-by. They never think of
straying far, and keep on the best terms w T ith the poultry; but, all of
a sudden, they are apt to start from their placid composure, and,
without any explanatory cause, assault one of the inmates of the
house, rush after somebody they see passing in the distance, or fall
upon a fowd, which is soon put to death if timely help is not forth-
coming. These fits of mad rage have prevented me from keeping the
Eared Pheasants loose, as I did at first, and I have been obliged to
confine them in a closed aviary by themselves. But more than a pair
cannot be kept together, and even then their courting is so brutal
that the deluded spouse may find that she has caught a Tartar and
have to be removed in a pitiful plight, often beyond recovery. No
wonder that the ancient Chinese warriors decorated their helmets
with the plumes of the Eared Pheasant as a token of their own
pugnacity. The courage of the bird is such that I have seen one
*driving away a cat that was trying to stalk it in the grass.
The Eared Pheasant was introduced into Europe in the
sixties. In 1864 Mr. Berthemy, the French Minister in China, sent
two males and one female to the Acclimatization Society. In 1866.
Mr. Dudley E. Saurin presented some specimens to the Zoological
Society of London, and the same year Mademoiselle de Bellonet
succeeded in raising eighteen birds from a pair which had been sent
to her by her brother, the Secretary of the French Legation at Pekin.
The bird is now well known, as it has spread in zoological gardens
and private collections, and I daresay that it is not necessary to
observe that its so-called ears are no ears at all, but two tufts of white
feathers, which, upturned in the way of a moustache, encircle the

head. But one cannot too much admire the beautiful tail-coverts,
which flow over the back like a mantle, in striking contrast, by their
white colour, with the dark brown plumage of the bird. These
feathers, whose barbs are separate, might easily supplant the so-
called osprey feathers for millinery purposes, and this should be an
incentive for pursuing the domestication of the Eared Pheasant and
" taming the shrew."

CHINESE CAGE BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997998814814815" page_id="32704662"  page_num="292" year="" vol="">
By Fleet-Surgeon K. H. Jones, M.B., B.N.
No one can take a stroll in the native quarter of Hong Kong
or in any of the large native cities of China, and not be struck both
by the number of bird-fanciers' shops, and by the abundance of
cages hanging outside the houses and booths.
We all of us are aware that the Heathen Chinee is peculiar,
and in his bird-fancying he is no less so than in most other ways,
according to Occidental notions.
The Chinese is exceedingly fond of taking his avian friends
for a walk into the country, and often one may meet a middle-class
Celestial strolling along with a small but beautifully-made bamboo
cage balanced on the palm of his outstretched hand, or sitting on
the grass whilst his insectivorous little pet grubs busily for treasures
entomological in the earth exposed by the removal of the bottom of
its cage. In these peculiarities, as in his method of exhibiting single
flowers in solitary vases, it is by no means certain that the man
from Far Cathay suffers by comparison with his Western brother.
Bird-catching must go on to a considerable scale in China, to
judge by the crowds of birds to be found in the bird-shops, and also
by the quantities shipped on board coasting steamers brought to the
south from the north, and sometimes vice-versa. The members of the
crews of the coasting steamers coming down from Taku and other
North China ports have almost always each a private venture in
cage-birds.
Should one chance to travel in a coasting steamer from any
North China port to Hong Kong, one will see on a sunny morning
almost every man of the Chinese crew who is off duty sunning his

birds in the little and often much overcrowded cages on the fore-
well deck.
Of course in a country which supports so large a proportion
of its population in boats, bird-shop junks and sampans are not
unknown, and one may see these ungainly craft simply hung all
over with cages full of Canaries and other feathered songsters.
In addition to the volume of trade in cage birds which flows
along the coast in junks and steamers, a considerable amount also
follows the great rivers in these craft.
At the same time the variety in species seen at the coast
ports is not observable in the interior, where, in Southern China at
any rate, the great majority of cage birds are individuals of two
species --Copsyclius saularis and Zosterops simplex. In some places
various species of Larks are fairly common, and especially is this
the case with Alauda ccelivox. Doubtless native bird-catchers exist
in Far Cathay ; but it is pretty certain that in South-East China,
at any rate, the great majority of non-imported birds are taken as
nestlings, and reared either by the parents or by hand.
It is for this reason difficult to get a Chinese to show to a
European nests and eggs of Zosterops simplex, Copsychus saularis, or
Alauda ccelivox.
Bird-catchers who use clap-nets and call-birds may exist, and
have been said to do so, but the writer never actually saw them.
Trailing a net over the dried-up paddy fields after dark to
capture the so-called Rice Birds (which are really Buntings of various
species) is a common practice. The birds, however, are killed and
sold as delicacies for culinary purposes.
Snares one sees on rare occasions, but they also are to kill,
and flight-nets on mud flats for the taking of Ducks and other wild
fowl are as well known in the East as in the West.
Of all the birds one sees in captivity in Southern China,
perhaps Zosterops simplex (the little Chinese \\ hite Eye) is the most
popular. These little birds ai'e taken from their nests when almost
able to fly, and are placed in a cage not far, as a rule, from the site of
their birthplace, when the parents come to feed them.
These birds become very tame in a very short time, and are
extremely fascinating pets.

Fleet-Surgeon I\. H. Jones,
Almost as popular as Z. simplex is Copsychus saulctris (the
Magpie Robin). These birds are also, as a rule, removed from their
nests before they can fly.
The Chinese spend a lot of time searching for the nests of
this species, with a view to removing the young when sufficiently
grown.
This species has a pleasant song and becomes very tame.
One of these birds, seen at Hong Kong, performed a sort of tumbling
trick round its perch, and also displayed great boldness in making
pretended attacks on its owner.
In a wild state these birds are very courageous, and attack
Blue Magpies and other robbers without fear.
Trochalopteron conorum (the " Wah Mee " = "painted eye
brows " of the Chinese, from its white superciliary stripe) occasionally
occurs as a cage bird at Hong Kong, but apparently does not thrive.
Dryonastes sinensis (the Chinese Babbling Thrush) is not at
all uncommon ; but although the species breeds at Hong Kong it is
not common in a wild state there, and the live-stock dealers assert
that their specimens come from Kwangsi up the West River.
This species has a few mellow, flute-like notes, which, heard
occasionally out in the woods, are rather pleasing. In captivity,
however, the same few notes repeated continually with maddening
persistence very shortly grow wearisome in the extreme.
These birds seem to thrive in captivity, and there is no great
difficulty in feeding them.
Liothrix lutea is a common cage-bird in South-Eastern China,
but in a wild state it is rare, and where the caged specimens so often
seen are obtained is doubtful -- possibly not far from Hong Kong, for
many species are wonderfully local in distribution.
Passer montanus : Tree Sparrows are often seen in the bamboo
cages of the Celestial bird-fanciers, crowded together in astonishing
numbers, and with them are occasionally incarcerated a few speci-
mens of Passer rutilans (the Russet Sparrow). Whether the Chinese
eat these sparrows or what becomes of them is doubtful.
Java Sparrows are very often seen caged in China, and less
often the other local Munias, but the smaller species from the Malay
Archipelago are very common in confinement, and, as they at times

escape, sometimes appear in the woods and gardens as stray
introductions.*
A very common and very favourite cage bird both north and
south in China is the Mongolian Lark, or Shantung Lark as the bird-
fanciers call it ( Melanocorypha mo7igolica).
This Lark is readily tamed, and is a beautiful singer. The
Chinese place the bird in a cage with a small pedestal in the centre,
and on this it sits, dropping its wings and spreading out its tail, to
give vent to its song. The song is very sweet, but compared with
that of a Skylark it is feeble.
Another very favourite Lark is Alauda ccelivox, and, unlike the
last, it is a common bird in the south of China. These birds also
are placed in little cages fitted with a pedestal, on which they mount
to sing.
The Chinese often take these little Larks into the country, and
there, removing the bottom of the cages placed upon the ground,
allow the inmates to pick up insects, etc., from the grass.
At times contests in singing are held between the birds, the
cages being put in close proximity and the inmates encouraged to sing
one another down.
A wild Lark of this species may also challenge a caged bird,
and a vigorous competition be thus instituted.
Cockatoos and various species of Parrots are very commonly
kept caged in Hong Kong and Canton, and now and again escape
into the country-side.
It has been surmised that the King-necked Parroquets
(Palceornis torquatus), now fairly common at Hong Kong, may have
been first thus introduced there. Canaries are also plentiful in the
fanciers' shops and on the bird-shop sampans of the harbour, but
as these birds are not indigenous they do not seem to call for any
special mention.
There are, of course, many species which occur occasionally
as cage-birds in China, but the few above-mentioned constitute the
bulk of those commonly to be met with there.
* One sees some funny strays at Hong Kong. I&apos;ve seen a pink and grey
Cockatoo on a tree in the R.N. Hospital, and I picked up a Mongolian Lark
(Melunocoryplui mongolica ) alive and well on my verandah there. I kept it a
long time in a cage and very tame it was.--K. H. J.

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
It is noticeable that while forms differing only in colour, even
when ranked by us as species, habitually interbreed freely where their
ranges overlap, species differing in structural characters only do
so sporadically. Thus, among our own birds, the Hooded and Carrion
Crows, where they meet in the breeding season, pair indiscriminately,
but the Capercailzie and Blackcock only produce hybrids here and
there.
There seems to be, however, a remarkable exception to this
among the Pheasants of the Kaleege group, where an unbroken chain
of forms, to all appearance due to interbreeding, exists between
the black Horsfield's or Purple Kaleege (Gennceus horsfielcli ) and
the lovely Silver Pheasant ( G. nycthemerus ) of our aviaries. Yet
the nearest member of the group to this, the Lineated Kaleege (Gf.
lineatus), which shows a recognisable approach to the Silver Pheasant
in its coloration, being black below and pencilled above, differs from
it in several structural points ; its crest is narrow and expands
laterally, instead of being full and expanding only vertically ; its tail
is short and almost hen-like, and it is much smaller, only about half
the Silver Pheasant's size.
I have noted another very important difference in the
Lineated Kaleeges bred at the Zoo. The Silver Pheasant is well
known not to get his full male plumage till the year following that
of his birth ; the Lineated bird gets his colour in his first autumn--
indeed, he is nearly in complete male colour long before he is full-
sized, so that he looks rather like a bantam edition of his sire. The
hen Lineated also is as fully crested as the male, while in the Silver
Pheasant the crest of the hen is so short as hardly to be noticeable.
Well-characterised species can exist side by side without
intermixing. A good case of this is seen in the Amherst and Golden
Pheasants, which do not become fused in the wild state, though in-
habiting the same area, owing to the hostility of the Amherst to the
Golden, which it drives from its own favourite localities, according

to P6re David, in his ' Oiseaux de la Chine.' Yet these species can
be crossed in captivity, and the hybrid, as is well known, is perfectly
fertile, showing a close blood-relationship. Now if we compare the
males of these two Pheasants, we find that they could be easily
distinguished by structural characters, even if they were all white.
In the Gold Pheasant the crest is full, and covers the whole crown ;
the ruff is square-tipped, and all the under-plumage disunited and
glassy-looking; in the Amherst the crest is scanty and confined
to the back of the crown, the ruff is round-tipped, and the under-
plumage is close-textured and on the breast scale-like and velvety,
while the ruff and tail are much larger than in the golden bird.
Moreover, the Amherst has in both sexes a conspicuous bare area
round the eye. Thus, although forming a natural generic group,
the two species have good structural differences. As to the meaning
of genera, I should like to quote here what I said in " The Indian
Pheasants and their Allies," published in the ' Indian Forester,'
vol. xxviii, 1902, p. 228 (it is not in these articles as republished
in book-form, with additions, as ' The Game-Birds of India and
Asia '):
" It is often stated, even by high zoological authorities, that
genera have no real existence in nature, but are only the invention
of naturalists for cutting up the numerous species into manageable
groups, the species themselves being presumed to be real enough.
This notion is entirely fallacious. A genus is, or should be, a group
of species, each of which more closely resembles all the other species
of that group than it does any other species outside. This being so,
a genus is just as real a thing as the species of which it is composed,
and this is obvious enough in the rare cases when the separate
species of the whole genus each have a popular name. For instance,
ic would be absurd to admit the existence of the Carrion Crow, our
old friend the Indian House-Crow, the Raven, Rook, and Jackdaw,
and then say that the genus ' Crow,' or Corvus, in scientific language,
which includes all these, did not exist except in the imagination of
naturalists. A ' Crow ' is a big (more or less) black bird of certain
physical attributes, and most people recognise the existence of the
genus before they know the species."

By Lieut.-Col. A. Lloyd.
I have been asked to write a short account of my Indian Grey
Partridge. Sultan has honoured me with his company for over eight
years, and he was brought to England from India a few months
before he was given to me. The first two winters Sultan felt the
cold greatly and used to huddle up to the fire. Now he seems fairly
well acclimatised, but of course needs care ; has constant fires ; even
in summer he mostly has a fire in the mornings. Sultan runs about
the dining- and drawing-rooms in the daytime, and at night goes up
on to the sideboard in the dining-room to roost. When I go to bed
I persuade Sultan to go into his cage, and I take him up to my
room. A piece of flannel is put on the floor of his cage. One night
the parlourmaid forgot it, and Sultan's language on the subject while
being carried upstairs was decidedly unparliamentary. Sultan loves
squatting on my knee and being stroked, and he delights in a fight
with a newspaper crumpled up and pushed backwards and forwards.
Sultan makes the " feathers " fly and crows in triumph.
In summer Sultan enjoys walks in the garden and runs after
me like a little dog ; he takes no notice of Robins and such small fry,
but if Thrushes or Blackbirds venture near him he chases them
Sultan gets very excited if he sees poultry on the common,
swears at them, and has to be kept from dashing after them.
Sultan hardly ever flies, likes running up sloping roofs, and
climbing up inside the creepers on the house. He is afraid of nothing,
wishes to attack dogs, and one day pursued a stoat, which fortunately
did not see him.
Sultan has strong likes and dislikes for people, and never
changes his mind about them, but to some people he is indifferent
and takes no notice of them. He was very fond of one gardener I
had, and spent hours in the garden watching John work, keeping
about a yard ahead of him. The next gardener Sultan hated ; they
could not be in the garden together, as Sultan pecked the gardener's
legs so much that he could not work at all.

Sultan's diet consists of white, yellow, and red millet and
canary-seed, lettuce, and meal-worms. He is very fond of cake, also
of puddings, such as souffee, lemon, etc. ; they must be very hot, and
have eggs in them.
Sultan is clever in finding ants' nests in the garden and enjoys
the eggs greatly.
There is a large box of sandy earth in the dining-room, and
Sultan revels in a dust-bath two or three times a day.
Sultan has only been really ill once; he caught a chill in
June some years ago, and in half an hour he got so weak that he
could only just stagger along. He had three drops of opium, and next
day a couple of doses of syrup of squills, was kept in one room for a
week, a big fire day and night, temperature of room kept up over
80* F.
I said Sultan fears nothing. I forgot aeroplanes. One flew
over when Sultan was in the garden one day; he was quite
frightened, evidently thought it was a mighty bird of prey, and he
scuttled away under a bush.
Sultan sends salaams to all who may read about him ; he still
remains full of life and vigour.

(Concluded from p. 272.)
I also have a brood of Monauls, hatched under a Light Sussex
hen. There were six. One died very suddenly ; I think the hen
injured it. The five lived happily in the garden, until they took
to roosting in the lower branches of a tall cupressus on the edge of
the moat, when one morning, to my dismay, only three ran to my
feet to feed when I whistled. Under the tree I found where one
had been devoured, and by an Owl without much doubt, and of the
other there was no trace. Hastily I lured the remaining three (as
large as full-grown Partridges) into a small poultry-house with a
wire run, into which they walked like lambs, and I tried to encourage
my drooped spirits and my great disappointment by--" Better three
than none."

Congratulatory broods.
In the afternoon of the tragedy I went round at 3 o'clock to
feed them, saw two in the run and one outside! " How on earth-- ? "
At that moment a third walked out of the roosting-house, and then
I realised that the "outsider" was the lost bird, which must have
fled away in the night when the marauder took the other.
It pleased me greatly, for it shows that these splendid
Pheasants have a homing instinct, and it is my intention to leave
them at large when they are grown enough to roost higher, and are
too big for cats to seize upon.
The parent birds are in an aviary.
Is there anything more gorgeous than a male Monaul in full
beauty ? The shimmering copper on the neck, with the emeralds,
sapphires and amethysts which flash on his upper parts, is enhanced
by the deep black of the breast and the chestnut-coloured tail.
The egg of this Pheasant is very handsome. The size of a
domestic hen's, but longer -- a rich buff, profusely spotted with
chestnut.
The young are perfectly easy to rear -- custard for the first four
or five days and then meal.
My birds had the advantage of as much wild green food as
they wanted, and this is very necessary, passing the day with their
foster-mother amongst bushes, where they no doubt found plenty of
insects.
I had hoped for a brood of Ross's Snow Goose. Four eggs.
Two came to nothing, although fertile ; one beautiful gosling which
hatched was squashed in the night by a lumping Light Sussex hen,
and the survivor was pecked on the head by a Jackdaw and succumbed
to its injuries. These goslings are clothed in yellowish-green down,
which is extremely abundant and fluffy. (June.)
The four Monauls (August) are now larger than a common
hen Pheasant, and have their squared chestnut tails, barred with
dark brown, in the place of the pointed feathers of the first plumage.
They have taken to roosting inside a large barn, high up under the
roof on a cross-beam, entering under the barn door, jumping on to a
waggon, and so up from beam to beam. They run every morning to
meet me in the garden.

The Black Drongo, nicknamed the King Crow, has black
plumage and a long forked tail. Binoculars reveal to us that the
iris of its eye is red, giving it a rather wicked appearance. After the
manner of many other Flycatchers it perches conspicuously on tele-
graph-wires and fence-posts. In temper it resembles our Kingbird,
which accounts for the " King " part of its sobriquet, and the books
tell us that it is a valiant tighter of the Crows ; also that its methods
of catching insects and building its nest are such as we observe in
our Kingbird. Of the several cousins of this bird only the White-
bellied Drongo (Dicrurus ccerulescens) was seen. He is a striking
fellow in appearance with the keen contrasts of his colours.
Another bird frequently seen along this first route was the
Indian Roller (Goracias indica). This species, partial to both fence-
posts and telegraph-wires, seems to favour the former. When
perched it is a beautiful sight, but on the wing it is a dream of love-
liness as its greenish-blue colours, mingled with various other shades
of blue, gleam in the sunlight. Its brilliant colouring, together with
its large size, a trifle more than 12 in. in length, makes it a con-
spicuous sight, which is noted by all travellers, no matter how
blind they are to other birds. Since it hunts for its insect food very
much as do our Shrikes there is frequent display of its enchanting
colours. Although sacred to the god Siva, this distinction has not
saved it from the toils of the plumage-hunters, and it is far less
numerous than so useful and beautiful a creature ought to be. It
was my experience to note the species quite often in some portions of
the southern journey, and in diminishing numbers as far as Delhi,
after which none was seen. It is interesting to recall that Mr. Finn
has written that he thinks this species can be acclimatised in
America. It certainly is a pity that the experiment was not tried
upon some such bird instead of the hateful English Sparrow.
The Indian Roller is frequently called a Blue Jay; anent this
slip Mr. Douglas Dewar has this to say : " He is not a Jay at all, but

the misnomer is perhaps a pardonable one, for in more respects than
one the bird resembles the true Jays, and I am told that the European
Roller ( Coracias garrula), a near relative of the Indian Blue Jay, is.
known in parts of Germany as the Birch Jay. American visitors to*
India, however, make no such mistake. You never hear one of them
call the Roller a Jay. They dub him the Surprise Bird, a name which
admirably suits both him and the Paddy Bird."
Along the railway route through Jubbulpore (and occasionally
in other parts of India), two species of birds, both small and green
of plumage, were quite numerous. These w T ere the common Indian
Bee-eater ( Merops viridis) and the Crimson-breasted Barbet (Xantlio-
Icema hamatocephala). A large flock of the Barbet was seen daily-
near my hotel in Delhi, and they were quite plentiful on Mount
Abu. They are rather droll, clumsy-looking little fellows, as one-
would expect to be true of a species closely related to the Wood-
peckers. Their predominant colour is green with sulphur-yellow
trimmings about the head, and with patches of crimson on the
forehead and throat. Unfortunately for the tourists these birds are-
silent during cool weather, and we did not hear their peculiar
metallic notes that have earned for them the nickname of Copper-
smith.
In spite of the brilliant green colouring of the Common Indian
Bee-eater, its gentle mien and fly-catching habits constantly remind
one of the Phoebe, and the impression is deepened when we find
three or four of them sitting closely together on a branch in the-
exact fashion of a brood of young Phcebes. The books say that this,
fondness for each other's society leads them in some places to roost
in large companies; also that they nest in burrows that they dig for
themselves in the banks of the rivers and ravines. Although their
size and colours are similar, yet their slender forms and long central
tail-feathers readily distinguish them from the short-tailed, chunky
Barbets.
The railway journey to Calcutta occupied forty-four hours,
and terminated in the grey dawn of a January day. It was in this-
city that the more leisurely observation of the birds &amp;quot;began. Among
the first birds noted were two representatives of a species not met
with afterward, though it is said to be a common species in winter

throughout the region of the plains. It was a brown bird that
perched on dead twigs and flicked its tail like a Phoebe, being about
the size of that bird, but the shape of its head was shrike-like, as
were its motions when it darted to the ground for insects, therefore
it was with genuine satisfaction I found that afternoon m the Indian
Museum a mounted specimen of the species labelled Indian Brown
Shrike (Lanius cristatus) ; and near it another specimen of a female
Indian Koel ( Eudynamys honorata), which settled for me the
identity of a large speckled bird that was watched for a long time
that morning. It belongs to the Cuckoo family, and arouses interest,
because, true to the traits of its tribe, it lays its eggs in the nests of
other birds.
Besides many interesting glimpses of the industrial life and
customs of the natives, a visit to the banks of the Hooghly River
afforded an introduction to the Brahminy Kite (. Haliaster inches).
Several of these handsome birds were flying over the river; others
perched in the rigging of ships were preening themselves. This is
another species that shows great beauty of colouring when on the
wing, the bright, clear, chestnut-rufous or maroon colour of its upper
plumage contrasting finely with the under parts, which are white,
narrowly streaked with brown ; its head and neck are white also.
This scavenger of the surface of the river was frequently seen to the
westward as far as Benares, gracing now and then the top of a
fence-post by the wayside, from which it watched for frogs and
crabs and other favoured tidbit.

With regard to the Indigo-Finch referred to in the above
paper, it is convincing enough, but by no means so absolutely inter-
mediate as a beautiful example which I left some years ago with the
late Sir William Flower; hoping that, after he had studied it, he
would hand it over to my colleague, Dr. Sharpe, for the Museum
series ; unfortunately it appears never to have found its &amp;quot;way into the
collection.

Colour change without a moult.
The change of colour from young to aclult plumage in Paroaria
was, I believe, regarded as absurd by certain ornithologists ; but that
is certainly not the only group in which startling transformations
of juvenal into adult plumage are effected without a moult. Of
Agelasticus thilius, I purchased what purported to be a pair in 1894 ;
in the autumn the supposed hen died during its change from the
young to the adult male plumage (dissection proved it to be a cock
bird). In this specimen, which I have before me, the general tone
of the plumage is smoky rather than bluish-black as in the perfected
male feathering, a few feathers on the crown still retain partly brown
tips, as also most of those on the mantle ; the wing-coverts and
secondaries still retain their well-defined, red-brown borders ; the
throat feathers have their fringes partly white, but many of those on
the breast are in a transitional stage, some of the fringes being whity-
brown, whilst at the sides, on the lower abdomen, and vent this
colour is prevalent.
All bird-students agree that many birds gain their nuptial
plumage by shedding the tips or fringes of their feathers ; but we
have no right to assume that this is the case with all those which do
not pass through a regular spring moult. Our common Bedstart is
supposed to shed the tips of its feathers ; yet I have a male which
died during the change of plumage, and its colouring is intermediate
between that of winter and summer, but the fringes are not abraded.
Birds in a wild state are far more likely to get the edges of their
feathers rubbed off than those properly looked after in semi-captivity ;
so that if shot with partly abraded fringes to the feathers, they may
incline one to come to incorrect conclusions. In the case of my
Bedstart, two-thirds of most of the feathers of the hind-breast and
abdomen (and not the fringes alone) would have to be sacrificed in
order to acquire the summer colouring by abrasion.
I always like to give reasons for my views, but to those who
do not regard them as conclusive, I do not desire to be dogmatic ;
there is so much to learn and so little that we understand of the
workings of Nature that we can only conclude -- " Magna est veritas
et prevalebit."

By a misfortune without parallel in the history of aviculture,
Lieut. Delacour's collection at Villers-Bretonneux has been utterly
destroyed. The Editor feels that no words of his can adequately

an entire zoological garden of birds. A short account of the catas-

A full account of this grand collection appeared in the
' Avicultural Magazine ' for November and December, 1917, and
January, 1918. It was illustrated with two plates, and is well worth
re-reading. The aviaries were again figured in our issue for April,
1918.

This is an interesting book. Consisting of reprints from the
' Times of India Illustrated Weekly,' the volume before us deals
with a number of dumb companions -- feathered, furred, and scaled.
While all parts of the work are well worth reading, it is with the
bird portion that we aviculturists are chiefly concerned.
The author has the power of writing interesting and accurate
description ; this is seen both in his studies of special individuals,
and also in the field notes of the movements of whole flocks of
birds. Weavers, Golden and Imperial Eagles, Vultures, Crows,
Choughs, Wild Duck, and Cormorant, figure in these pages; we see
the Coucal stalking by the water's edge, and the Tragopan high on
the snowy slopes of the Himalayas. Humour is also to be found in
these pleasant pages, as, for instance in this account of two Baya
Weavers kept by the writer:
" From the date their eyes opened Willy grabbed the stick of
food, as soon as it was put near him, and it had to be withdrawn
forcibly, before stick and all went down his throat, but with Billy it
was different. He opened his mouth very wide and screamed for
his food, and emphasibed his request by shaking his whole head at a

terrific pace. The result was that the stick missed the mouth and
the gruel went all over his head and eyes, and had to be wiped off.
Constant applications of gruel were not conducive to the growth of
feathers, with the result that, long after Willy's head was well
covered, Billy's alternated between feathers and gruel stains."
The author uses both camera and pencil in illustrating the
book, and we especially like the frontispiece, depicting an Eagle in
flight, bearing a Pheasant in its talons. There is also a good photo-
graph of the nest of a Baya Weaver.
The illustrations, unfortunately, are of unequal merit; several
-- apparently enlargements -- being quite indistinct. There are also
errors in the letter-press : judging from remarks on pp. 12 and 36,
the writer believes that the maw of a bird is its mouth, while several
misprints also occur. We do not know what tint " isabeline " may
be, though acquainted with " isabeZZine," so called from Queen
Isabella. The " b four r el " is unknown to zoology, the Himalayan
blue sheep being styled burrhel; it would indeed be interesting to
see a trained Weaver Bird let off a toy " canon," and we can well
believe the statement on p. 24, that " everything hinges on his first
mastery of this secret." G. B.
GAPES.
Mr. Alfred Thom writes :
Speaking of gapes, I notice that Mr. Moody does not mention
the cure of putting turpentine down the wind-pipe with a feather,
which I have always found successful with young chickens.
For diarrhoea, I have found putting small birds for some hours
in my airing cupboard, which is very hot, a very good cure. It is
nearly as hot as the hottest room of a Turkish bath. Often I leave
them in it all night. For egg-binding I also find it very good, even
without anointing.
