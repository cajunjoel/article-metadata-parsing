CAPTIVE BREEDING OF THE LESSER GREEN
BROADBILL
</sectionHeader>

By Ed Lewis (San Diego Zoo, San Diego, California, U.S.A.)
The Lesser Green Broadbill Calyptomena viridis continentis is the most
well known species in the Eurylaimidae family. These are deep forest
dwellers of the Old World Tropics ranging from Southern Burma, Thailand
to Malaysia; Sumatra, Borneo and some of the adjacent islands. Both sexes
have short stout bodies with wide flat bills. The males are iridescent
emerald-green with black above the eye and behind the hind cheek. The
primaries and secondaries are barred in black. There is a short crest that
extends over the long wide bill. The female is similar but more drab in
colour and lacks the black markings.
The Zoological Society of San Diego has maintained Lesser Green
Broadbills in its collection since August 1964. However, it was not until
August 1992 that any attempt at breeding was observed.
This particular pair of Broadbills along with a pair of Pompadour Green
Pigeons Treron pompadora and a single Striated Yuhina Yuhina castaniceps
were housed in an outside enclosure measuring 3.7m x 6m x 3m. The rear
wall is concrete with two doors leading into anti-rooms used as keeper
access. The back 75 centimetres is covered by a concrete roof, while the
rest of the enclosure is covered with 1.3cm x 2.5cm 12 gauge galvanised
welded wire.
The enclosure was rather thickly planted with a variety of tropical flora
with several large Tupidanthus sp. dominating the landscape. Other plants
in the exhibit included Raphis humilis, Cassia sp., and Phyllostachys aurea.
The diet of the birds in the enclosure consisted of a diced fruit mix,
(apples, papaya, grapes and boiled long grain rice), a slice each of banana,
papaya, and avocado, crickets, mealworms Tenebrio molitor, wax moth
larvae Galleria mellonella, soaked Purina Hi-Pro dogchow, and Zeigler
Low-iron pellets. Blair's Super Preen powered vitamin/mineral supplement
was sprinkled on the diet.
During August of 1992 to August of 1993 the Lesser Green Broadbills
nested three times.

Nest 1
On August 21, 1992 at 1630, the hen was observed approximately 2
metres high under the concrete roof in an artificial nest. The nest they
chose was a domed woven basket measuring 18 cm high and 12cm deep.
Shortly after being noticed, the female flew from the nest to perch beside
the male. The male began to "head bob" and vocalise, after which, the
female flew to another perch.
The next morning the hen stayed in the nest until 11.47 at which time
the nest was inspected and one oval white egg was observed. The female
returned to the nest approximately 10 minutes later. At 15.47 the female
left the nest and bathed in the water pan. After fluffing and preening for
several minutes, she began bobbing her head and calling. The male
answered. They called back and forth and changed perches several times.
Twice the male came down to the perch beside the female, both head bobbed
and vocalised. The female opened her mouth towards the male, then
vocalised more and the male flew away. This happened twice within the
hour that the female was off the nest.
On August 23 at 11.30 when the hen left the nest two eggs were observed.
It was decided at this time to minimise all disturbance to the enclosure. On
August 25, video equipment was installed for observation and recording of
the nesting activities.
Through direct and video tape observation, it was observed that only
the female incubated the eggs. The male was never seen at the nest. The
male did, however, continue to vocalise and would occasionally try to
approach the female when she would leave the nest. In contrast to the
period before egg laying, the female was not receptive to his approach and
would immediately fly away.
On September 8, the hen was off the nest at 7.30 the nest was inspected
and 1 chick and 1 egg were observed. There were no eggshell fragments
found in the nest or on the exhibit floor. At 8.49 the female was hanging
on the side of the nest basket feeding the chick.
A second video cameras was installed in order to monitor the food pan
more accurately for the specific food items that were being taken during
the chick rearing process.
The morning of September 9, revealed 2 chicks - one twice the size of
the other. The food pan and the nest were observed for a total of 10 hours
during which time the female was observed feeding the chicks 18 times.
There were a total of 21 visits to the food pan. Eight times avocado was
taken, 5 times fruit mix, 3 times wax moth larvae, once dog food, and there
were 4 visits in which nothing was taken.
Throughout the day of September 10, both chicks were visible and
exhibiting very strong feeding responses whenever the female would land
on the nest. 22 feedings were observed from 07.15 to 18.30.

The next day, however, there was only one chick visible when the female
would feed. The previous day's video tapes were reviewed in detail and
upon very close scrutiny it was observed that at approximately 17.30 the
female seized the smaller of the two chicks in her mouth and appeared to
strangle it. Surprisingly, the chick was not only active and exhibiting a
strong feeding response just prior to this, but also appeared to struggle
against the attack.
After the chick ceased struggling, the hen flew off with the body.
Approximately 30 minutes later the hen returned to the nest and fed the
remaining chick after which she entered the nest and began to brood as
before.
The next three days proceeded with regular feeding and brooding of the
remaining chick. However, on September 14, there was no feeding activity
at the nest. Upon inspection the body of the chick was discovered on the
ground approximately 2 metres from the nest. The video tapes did not
render any new insights into this assumed second genocide.
Reviewing the video tapes of the food pan revealed that the item most
taken during the six days in which the female was feeding the chicks was
avocado. Second, was insects with a preference for wax moth larvae and
mealworms over crickets. The diced fruit mix was third in frequency with
the soaked dog food only occasionally taken. Banana and papaya slices
were not eaten from at all.
Nest 2
April 13, 1993, the female Broadbill was observed building a nest about
1 meter off the ground in a Tubidanthus using strands of Spanish moss
Tillandsia usneoides, bamboo leaves Phyllostachys aurea and goat hair.
The female would carry the material to the water pan and soak it before
taking it to the nest site where she would drape the long strands over the
limb. After there was a large pendulous mass she would hang on the strands
circling around and around probing and tugging as she interwove the fibres.
By the 18th, the integrity of the nest was in question, so the same type
of woven basket as was used previously was placed in the nest mass. The
female was not disturbed by the manipulation. As she continued her own
additions, she eventually probed into the nest basket entrance. It was not
long before she was inside the basket lining it with bamboo leaves.
On April 26, two eggs were observed in the nest. A third egg was laid
on April 28 at which time the female began to incubate consistently, rarely
leaving the nest. When she did leave the nest during the day, she would
usually bathe before returning. This continued throughout incubation.
Since the male was not observed participating in any of the nesting or
chick rearing activities, it was decided to remove him in case he was

interfering in some unobserved way with the chick rearing process. On
May 7, the male was trapped in a catch cage and removed from the exhibit.
After a 17 day incubation period, two chicks hatched on May 14. The
chicks were orange with flat heads and yellow edged beaks. The female
was observed hanging on the side of the nest and feeding the chicks after
eating avocado and fruit mix.
On day 2 it appeared that the chicks were being fed mostly waxworms
and avocado. By day 5, the order of preference for food items was
waxworms/avocado, mealworms, crickets, mega worms, and then mixed
fruit. This remained consistent throughout the rest of the chick rearing
process.
On May 17, the 3rd unhatched egg was pulled and found to be infertile.
On May 21, there was only one chick in the nest. At 8 days, this chick
was becoming more grey in colour with two dorsal feather tracks appearing.
By May 24, the chick was large enough so that it was difficult for the hen to
enter the nest and brood. At 13 days, the pin feathers started to break open
in the scapular, dorsal and rump regions. On June 4, at 22 days, the chick
fledged weighing 51 grams. Its overall colouring was dull green with a
light-grey green breast. Its beak was horn coloured with a black tip and
yellow edges. Pin feathers were still visible on its head and the tail was
very short.
From the onset of incubation the female rarely vocalised, however, at
fledging, the hen very frequently called especially before and after feeding
the chick. The chick, on the other hand, was rarely heard vocalising at any
time. All seemed to be going well until the chick died at 28 days of age
from head trauma sustained from a female Striated Yuhina.
Nest 3
June 10, the male was reintroduced into the exhibit and the two began
to call back and forth and head bob immediately. By June 22 the female
was engaged in intense nest building in the same location as the previous
nest.
In order to minimise the possibility of future mishaps, the Striated Yuhina
and the Pompadour Green Pigeons were removed from the exhibit.
Once again a nest basket was added to insure the integrity of the nest.
However, because the original basket seemed to be too small for more than
one chick, a larger basket was used. This basket was made by forming a
domed basket of Trachycarpus fortunei palm fibres around an inflated
balloon. The fibres were adhered together with 3M super 77 spray adhesive
and the balloon was deflated and removed. The approximate dimensions
of this basket were 25 cm high and 16 cm deep. Again the female accepted
this addition without hesitation and was soon lining it with bamboo leaves.

On July 15, the male was removed from the exhibit and the first egg
was pulled to be artificially incubated.
On July 22, after an 18 day incubation period, all three eggs hatched:
one late morning, one mid afternoon, and one in the evening. The artificially
incubated chick died at 2 days with a bacterial infection. The two chicks in
the nest appeared to do well. At 7 days their eyes were just beginning to
open.
On August 13, one chick fledged at 22 days weighing 54 gms. The
other chick fledged two days later at a weight of 44gms. The hen continued
to feed the chicks until they were approximately 49 days old. At 70 days of
age, the chicks were taken from the exhibit and placed in an off-exhibit
holding enclosure. The weights of the young were 70 gms and 62 gms.
The two birds were sexed by size and weight. The larger, heavier bird
being a female, and the smaller, lighter bird a male. This was later
determined to be accurate by adult plumage.
Summary
Even though this is far from a consistent breeding programme, I would
like to offer the following as a summary of important information gathered
from this particular pair of Lesser Green Broadbills:-
1) Manipulation of the nest is possible to ensure better integrity.
2) The male does not participate in incubation or chick rearing and
may be a source of disturbance to successful chick rearing. Thus it is
recommended to remove the male after incubation has begun.
3) Preferred food items during chick rearing are avocado and wax worms
with mealworms, crickets, mega worms and mixed fruit. Occasionally
soaked dogchow was also taken.
4) Eggs were laid every day for a clutch of 2 - 3.
5) Incubation is 17-18 days. Incubation begins with the last egg.
6) Chicks fledge at 22 - 24 days of age and are not independent until
they are approximately 7 weeks old.

BREEDING THE TOUCAN BARBET AT THE TROPICAL
BIRD GARDENS, RODE
</sectionHeader>
<subsectionHeader confidence="0.411584">

The Toucan Barbet Semnornis ramphastinus comes from western
Columbia and central Ecuador. It is one of the larger Barbets being 20 cms
long. It has a heavy bill (hence its name) that is yellowish green with a
black tip. Forehead, crown black, black crown bordered laterally by a broad
white stripe. Feathers of the hind crown elongated so as to lie over mantle,
shining black (also note cock's are longer than hen's). Sides of head, ear
coverts, sides of neck, throat and breast blue-grey. A broad band of scarlet
across the breast this colour somewhat staining the centre lower breast and
upper abdomen (ours have turned yellow). Back olive brown with greyish
wing and tail.
It has long been one of those birds that are much sought after.
Importations are infrequent. Winged World are credited with the first
breeding in Great Britain in 1972, and this was reported in the Avicultural
Magazine. As far as I know the following account is the first success since.
Mike Curzon has told me that as these birds occur in the hills, a tropical
house is probably not the best place to keep Toucan Barbets. As we have
no tropical house here at Rode the birds have had plenty of fresh air and
our variable English climate.
Early in the spring of 1993 Rode were offered three Toucan Barbets, a
cock and two hens, with one of the hens dying later in 1993 for no apparent
reason. These birds had been part of a confiscated consignment and H.M.
Customs and Excise sold to Rode the Toucan Barbets. Since that time the
colour of the parents has faded somewhat. The three Barbets were kept
inside for two weeks and sorted themselves out into a pair and an odd hen.
Their food is generally banana, apples, grapes, some meat and seasonal
fruit which goes into the food mixer. Live food was almost ignored as was
Orlux softbill food! Their food was dusted with SA37 vitamin supplement.
In 1994 the birds nested and although a long time elapsed no youngster
appeared. Their accommodation from the start was an aviary, 3m at the
back and the front having six sides none of which is the same measurement
ranging from 89 cms to 139 cms. There is a shed on the western side (the
aviary faces south) being 83 cms high x 28 cms deep x 58cms long with a
shelf half way up for feeding. The shed is 49 cms off the ground. The
aviary has laurel and flowering currant (golden leaf variety) with a grass/
earthem floor.
Early in April there was a lot of calling, the cock hooting, then the hen,
then the cock and so on. Excavation took place in a newly installed log.

On 16th April both birds were quiet and it was thought that the hen must
have laid. I would only keep looking to see that all was well and not
interfere with the nest. On 13th May I noticed that more food was being
taken. Incubation was done mainly by the female. Mating wasn't observed,
and I saw no material being taken into the log. Nest inspection didn't take
place and will not be done until we have further successes. By 19th May I
could hear a chick in the box. Food intake was increased. When I went
into the aviary the cock would call the hen out of the box. When offered
live food (mealworms) she returned to the box. All went well and on 25th
May a single chick fledged. It was smaller than its parents with dark eyes.
The parents eyes are red outside with a black pupil. The young bird was a
duller colour than its parents. There was a small pony tail and it has
moulted into a cock.
The hen nested again so the youngster was taken away and put in an off
show aviary where Donald Risdon used to keep a few favourite birds. As
the bird grew older live food intake was reduced and more fruit eaten. At
the time of writing (November) live food in minimal.
He particularly liked bright red-coloured fruits like strawberries and
cherries, but also took raspberries and blackberries, It would have been
interesting to have had winter fruits like holly berries at the time of nesting.
At first the parents bathed a lot but now they prefer to sit in the rain.
They appear to drink little if anything. Nectar has not been offered. They
enjoy peanuts and sunflower seeds in the winter only. They took elderberries
from bushes planted outside their aviary. They would catch live food when
it entered their flight. They took some of the plague of wasps that were
here at Rode in this summer of 1995. The only other occupant in the
aviary was a single cock Grey Francolin, which subsequently died. The
nearest aviary contained a pair of Red-winged Starlings. The youngster
roosts, incidentally, in a finch-type next box i.e. half open fronted.
The Toucan Barbets are very popular with all our visitors, but especially
with those who are envious of us having a pair. The major problem with
the bird is the limited number that are imported. We would very much like
to hear from anyone who has or knows the whereabouts of other Toucan
Barbets so that a concentrated breeding programme can be undertaken.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE BREEDING OF THE
WRINKLED HORNBILL AT CHESTER ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.940667605263158" page_id="56260965"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
By Roger Wilkinson, Wayne McLeod, Darren Langford
and Roger Merry
Wrinkled Hombills Aceros corrugatus occur in the coastal lowland
forests of Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo. They are now extinct or close to
extinction in peninsular Thailand and scarce in Borneo. Whilst still
relatively common in Sumatra, they remain under threat from logging and
deforestation (Collar et. al. 1994, Kemp 1995). Of seven species of
threatened Hombills listed in the 1990 IUCN Red Data Book, only the
Wrinkled Hombill is held in European collections and should be a priority
for conservation breeding (Wilkinson 1992).
Chester Zoo received a pair of Wrinkled Hombills on 21 December
1986. These were confiscated birds received on loan from HM Customs &amp;
Excise. The pair were housed for their first winter in the Tropical House,
then moved to larger quarters in the Bird House where their aviary measured
6.2m x 3.0m x 5m high. The Hombills were provided with a nesting
barrel 100cm high x 68cm diameter with an elliptical entrance hole 21cm
high x 17 cm wide positioned just above the widest part of the barrel. The
barrel was filled with freshly composted bark.
In 1990 the birds made their first breeding attempt with the female
sealed in the nest barrel by 30 June. The female removed surplus bark to a
level just a few cms below the nest entrance and sealed the entrance with a
mixture of clay, faeces and food. During the early part of incubation the
male provided the female with clay to complete this task. She emerged on
7 September without any sign of eggs or chicks.
In late April 1991 the female again began sealing herself inside the
nesting barrel and completed this task in early May. From observations of
increased feeding activity it was suspected that eggs were hatched in the
middle of June but on 15 July two dead naked chicks were found thrown
out of the nest, one partly decomposed and the other more recently dead.
On 26 July the female broke out of the barrel ending this second nesting
attempt.
The nest barrel was then modified in the winter of 1991/1992 by the
addition of a removable side panel to permit keeper access if required. In
mid-June 1992 three chicks were hatched. One of these was thrown out of
the nest at less than a week old, and the two others survived until 1 August.
The Wrinkled Hombills nested earlier in 1993, and a chick that hatched
around 4 May was found dead on 21 June. Nest inspection then also revealed
an addled egg which measured ca. 58 x 37 mm. In both 1992 and 1993 the

chicks were well grown and estimated as six to seven weeks old on death.
A post-mortem on the 1993 chick indicated pneumonia resultant from a
pasteurella species as the cause of death.
The Wrinkled Hombills diet at this time comprised a variety of fruits
including diced apple, pear, tomato and grapes sprinkled with insectivorous/
meat mix, soaked Zoo Food A, and, whilst feeding chicks, large numbers
of garden snails which the adults took in preference to other food items.
Because of concern that these snails may not have been disease-free, it was
decided to discontinue their use for future breeding attempts.
Over the winter of 1993/1994 major changes were made to the nesting
barrel by the removal of most of its top and the addition of a "chimney"
structure of similar size to the barrel to form an escape- or funk-hole for
the female if it became necessary to inspect the nest during her incarceration.
These changes followed the recommendations of Poonswad et. al. (1987)
and have more recently also been suggested by De Ruiter (1994) and Kemp
(1995). This may have unsettled the hombills as for the first time in five
years the birds showed no inclination to breed in the summer of 1994.
The birds were moved to new and warmer quarters in the Tropical
House in autumn 1994 where the newly constmcted aviary measures ca.
6.0 x 4.0 x 5.3m high. A nest barrel was obtained that had its opening
slightly below the widest part of the barrel. This was designed to permit
the female to easily void her excreta outside the nest. The barrel was fixed
on a supporting framework then encased in a concrete material to simulate
a tall rainforest tree. The barrel measured 85 cm high x 60 cm at its widest
diameter, with an entrance slit of 25 cm x 13 cm wide some 3.4m above
the ground.
On 6 March 1995, both male and female Wrinkled Hombills were seen
spending time inside the nest barrel. By 22 March the female was spending
all her time inside the barrel and had almost completed plastering up the
nest entrance. The hombills were offered a variety of fruits including apple,
pear, banana, tomatoes, grapes and occasionally honeydew melon and kiwi
fmits, soaked Zoofood A and also locusts, pink rats and large morio worms
throughout this period. Fresh figs and avocado pear were also offered but
refused by the hombills. The diet was supplemented with SA 37, Stress,
bonemeal and powdered cuttlefish. On 3 April, the male was first noted
eating pink rats and by 1 May the large quantity of live food being taken
(15 pink rats, 35 large locusts and two handfuls of morio worms) indicated
that chicks were being fed. The appetite of the birds for live food became
difficult to meet as the amount of animal food was increased daily.
By 30 May, the birds were taking 70 pink rats, 40 large locusts and
four handfuls of morio worms in addition to fmit. On 2 June, the bills of
two chicks were first seen reaching up to take food from the female. The

male always fed the female directly and she then regurgitated the food to
the chicks. This was extremely laborious and time consuming as the male
would fill its throat pouch swallowing the food items one at a time and
then fly up to the nest barrel and individually regurgitate each item before
passing it to the female. Observations on 18 June, suggested that there
may be three chicks in the nest and this was confirmed on 1 July, when
three chicks were seen begging from the female. On 11 July, after one
hundred and eleven days in the nest the female finally emerged with three
well grown youngsters. At that time it became evident that in fact there
was a fourth chick and the final chick fledged on 14 July. The youngsters
appetite for animal food continued after fledging but this was gradually
reduced as greater and greater quantities of fruit were fed. One youngster
broke its upper mandible as a result of flying into the enclosure wire. Rapid
veterinary intervention was then necessary to rejoin the pendant tip to the
main part of the bill. The bird soon recovered and was one of the first
chicks to begin to feed itself. No chicks were seen to attempt to feed
themselves until over a month after fledging and two were still being fed
by their parents in early December, nearly five months after leaving the
nest.
On fledging, all four chicks resembled the adult male in having white
neck and facial feathers. In the smaller adult female these feathers are
black. Adult males also differ from the adult females in having larger,
more brightly coloured bills and yellowish, rather than blue gular pouches.
One of the four chicks was clearly larger than its nest mates and some four
months after leaving the nest it also showed development of an orange
casque. This proved to be the only male of the brood. There are presently
more unpaired females than males in Europe so we must hope this ratio
may change in future breedings.
Successful captive breedings of Wrinkled Hombills have now been
reported from a number of collections including Miami's Metro Zoo, New
Orleans Audubon Park and Zoological Garden, and Kuala Lumpur. The
first European breedings were at the private breeding station of Vogelpark
Walsrode on Mallorca in 1992, then at the breeding centre of Palmitos
Park on Gran Canaria in 1993 (Low, 1994).
The normal clutch size for Wrinkled Hombills is two to three eggs.
Four clutches from the same female at Audubon Park were all of three eggs
(Sigler &amp; Myers, 1992). Successful captive breedings that have been
reported all indicate one or two chicks being reared. This is the only case
to our knowledge in which four chicks have successfully been reared.
Keeping up with the huge appetites of the youngsters by providing unlimited
quantities of live-food may well be the most important factor in the captive
rearing of Wrinkled Hombills. Chester Zoo's success is believed to be a
first breeding in the United Kingdom.

BREEDING THE BLACK CRESTED GUINEAFOWL AT
BIRDWORLD

There has been confusion for what seems quite a long time as to where
the Black-crested Guineafowl should be placed taxonomically in relation
to their own family. It was previously considered that the genus Guttera
and other species was split into two distinct groups, the Kenya Crested
Guineafowl G. pucherani and the other species recognised as simply Crested
Guineafowl G. edouardi with morphological variations. The genus is now
best considered to form a single species with well marked subspecies
(Elliott). Five subspecies are now recognised.
The subspecies kept at Birdworld is G. pucherani edouardi native to
Eastern Zambia, Mozambique to North East South Africa, four specimens
of which have been with us since late 1992. Initially the two pairs were
kept separate and housed in aviaries next to each other though there was
no direct contact. This was done primarily because we were unsure of how
aggressive pairs would be if they were mixed. The diet given to these birds
consisted of a dish of Pheasant pellets, and added to this is chopped fruit, a
ration of soaked Avi plus softbill food, minced beef, and live food and
vitamins.
In July 1993, however, the pairs were moved to a new under cover
flight and allowed to run together. They proved to be quite tolerant and
were left as a group throughout the winter and the 1994 season. This
provided a minimum level of interaction between the birds which was hoped
might lead to breeding, but unfortunately this was not to be. The two pairs
did move as a loose flock, but within this the pairings were easily
recognisable, with cocks staying relatively closer to their own hens and
vice versa.
By May 1995 it was thought reasonable to try another move and so this
time the birds were moved into one of our large, grass floored Hombill
flights. Extra feeds were given to the Guineafowl in the form of whole
water melons and aubergines put in to the flight to allow them to feed a
little more naturally. Peanuts were also scattered in the aviary three
afternoons a week and a few handfuls of mealworms thrown in each evening.
All offerings were equally well relished.
Within fifteen days of being in the new aviary three eggs were picked
up from a ground scrape hidden in a tangle at the base of a old ivy stand.
They were taken to the Incubation Research Station, where they were cleaned
and incubation commenced. One more egg was found the day after
(12.06.95) after which there was a ten day break before one more egg was

produced. Then four days later a run of four eggs were laid with two days
between each. Each egg was incubated as it was picked up, which produced
a staggered hatch.
The incubation period averaged 25 days and was relatively straight
forward being similar to the incubation of their long domesticated cousin
the Helmeted Guineafowl and culminated with 88% hatchability from 100%
fertility. Of the nine eggs produced their measurement averaged 5.82cm
for length, 4.36cm for width and 47.17 grams in weight.
The rearing of the chicks was also quite simple as they hatched in close
succession to each other and therefore each chick had company with which
they could feed and rest. This is far more natural than chicks being reared
singularly. The chicks by nature of their production were started as two
distinct groups, four in each. Both groups were firstly placed into a small
wooden rearing box 30cms x 45cms x 38cms high with a dimmer controlled
60 watt bulb for heat.
Food given at first was a dry game bird rearing food, finely chopped
fruit and white mealworms. The mealworms were offered with tweezers
initially, but this tended to cause a panic between the groups and therefore
was stopped. This meant we did not see the chicks feeding. The food was
indeed being taken, particularly the live food which was dropped into the
boxes at intervals throughout the day.
After a week or so, because of the limited space in the rearing boxes, we
moved the birds into heated cages, which measured 75cms cubed. This is
a normal procedure for us when rearing Pheasant types, but usually the
move is only made when chicks are three to four weeks old. Even at this
young stage the four chicks in each group coped well and remained in the
same accommodation until they were four weeks old when, because of their
increasing size they needed to be moved again.
At six weeks old the eldest group of poults, which seemed relatively
slow growing compared to Pheasant poults of a similar age, were moved
once more into an on show flight accompanied by a pair of Rufous Treepies
Dendrocitta vagabunda.
A young Peafowl chick of a similar size was also mixed with the group
of Guineafowl with no adverse reaction from either species. Two weeks
later the second group were mixed with their older siblings, again with no
obvious problems. However after two days of apparent harmony, one of the
youngest group was found dead. It seemed unlikely that the Treepies would
have killed a bird of such a size though the poult certainly bore the marks
of their feeding behaviour. It was noticed after watching the group for a
while that the perpetrator was in fact the young Peafowl which was seen
pecking at the head of another small Guineafowl. Removal of the Peafowl
solved this problem, and all was well again for a further six or seven weeks.

The real problem occurred at this stage from intestinal worms and
although they were treated regularly, we could not, it appeared, control
reinfestation. Food was increased to try and combat the infestation and
although the birds had good appetites, the problem could not be controlled.
Three birds were lost before the medication began to work and as an extra
precaution the remaining four were moved back inside and given additional
heat. These remaining birds outwardly appeared well for a short period
before two more were lost from another reinfestation of worms.
Two birds, both cocks, survive and like their siblings look fit and well,
though we will need another good season to produce hens if we are to
create new unrelated groups.
As youngsters these Guineafowl moved naturally like small flocks,
moving to food or cover or simply investigating whatever took their interest
as a group. They retained their juvenile appearance in so far as their heads
remained striped, until fifteen or so weeks though the body plumage came
through with the white spotted blue feathering of their parents from three
weeks.
A small number of the Crested Guineafowl are still present in various
UK collections. The main problem, however, being that those present are
remnants of old groups and unfortunately differing sub species from our
own. Birdworld would therefore be interested in hearing from any keepers
of G. p. edouardi who would be interested in swapping for new blood so
that this sub-species can be propagated successfully in years to come.

breeding did not occur until 1992 when one chick which hatched was parent
reared but did not survive. In 1993 a chick did survive to adulthood. Due
to parental neglect, this chick was pulled for hand-rearing. Similarly in
1994, two more chicks were hand-reared after their parents abandoned
them, and in 1995 when four abandoned chicks were hand-reared. As of
yet, the reasons as to why the parents are not properly rearing their young
are not clear, but this has led to the discovery of less intensive hand-rearing
methods.
In the wild, Flamingos are generally weaned at about the time of fledging
at 75 days (Ogilvie, 1986). In captivity however, hand-reared young have
tended not to be weaned until much later. San Antonio reported one chick
hand-reared in 1981 was not weaned until it was 126 days old (Kunneman
and Perry, 1990). Similarly, the first chick hand-reared at NZP was not
weaned until it was 95 days old. However, the two chicks pulled for hand-
rearing in 1994 and all four of the 1995 hand-reared chicks began self
feeding anywhere from 21-26 days of age, and by 31 days of age, were
completely weaned.
All chicks pulled for hand-rearing were tube fed the diet developed at
the San Antonio Zoo. None of the chicks were younger than six days old
when removed from their parents, so feedings were initially made four
times a day beginning at 7.00am and ending at 5.30 pm. All chicks were
weighed prior to the first feeding of the day to monitor weight changes and
to ensure that daily weight gains did not exceed 10%. A consistent weight
gain in excess of 10% can lead to leg and wing deformities.
Regardless of age, food was made available to a chick as soon as it was
pulled for hand-rearing. Chicks, even at six days of age will investigate a
bowl of food out of curiosity. They are unable to filter feed at this age, but
will pick up and eat food items offered. In addition to the tube feeding,
chicks were offered the same pelleted diet that the adult flock was fed.
Although the adult birds were being fed Ziegler's Flamingo breeder at the
time the chicks were pulled for hand-rearing, the chicks were offered the
maintenance diet (Ziegler's Flamingo Fancier) which has a lower calcium
and protein content. Too much calcium or protein can lead to growth
problems. Dry pellets were offered but the chicks preferred the pellets
slightly moist as it appeared easier for them to pick up. Fresh water was
available at all times.

At two weeks of age, hand feedings were reduced to three times a day,
beginning at 7.00am and ending at 3.00pm. Pelleted food was still available
to the chick at all times. At the first sign of self feeding, anywhere from 22
days to 25 days, the mid-day feeding was eliminated. Over the next two to
three days, one hand feeding per day was eliminated so that generally three
days after first observing the chick first eating on its own, the chick was
weaned.
Once the chick was no longer receiving hand feedings, its weight was
still monitored daily to ensure that it was indeed consuming enough food
to maintain itself. It was also important to monitor weight to ensure that
daily gains did not exceed 10%. If a chick had lost weight, hand feeding
would have been resumed. However, once a chick began eating on its own,
it always ate enough to acquire the needed weight gains and the resumption
of hand feeding was not necessary.
Once weaned, presentation of the food become of utmost importance.
Food was placed in a crook which was placed in water in a small cement
pool. Fresh water was maintained in the pool at all times. The chicks tend
to dribble water onto the food after eating, so the food must be replaced
several times a day to maintain the correct consistency so that the chick
can pick it up.
Early weaning of Flamingo chicks seems to be facilitated by rearing
several chicks together. The single chick reared in 1993 was raised by
itself. Six Green-winged Teal Anas crecca were placed with the bird for
company, but weaning did not occur until the chick was 95 days old.
Even though early weaning was not expected in 1994, the two chicks
had food available to them from the day they were removed from the flock
at ten and six days respectively. The older chick was first observed eating
on its own at 29 days and at 32 days was weaned. The two chicks were
always together in their enclosure and this seemed to influence the younger
chick. It began self feeding at 23 days and was weaned at 25 days of age.
Encouraged by the early weaning of the 1994 chicks, the 1995 chicks
were also provided with food upon removal from the flock.
The first chick pulled for hand-rearing was weaned at 28 days, and the
second chick was weaned at 25 days. The third and fourth chicks were
weaned at 31 days and 28 days respectively.
Early weaning has not posed any health or growth problems for any of
the six chicks that have been weaned by one month of age. While the
hand-rearing diet developed by San Antonio Zoo is designed to feed a chick
from day one until weaned, chicks at NZP developed no difficulties
associated with discontinuing the hand-rearing formula at an early age.
Even though the chicks have been with their parents the first six to
fourteen days of life, they accept their caretakers soon after removal from
the flock. Once hand rearing is eliminated and contact is greatly reduced

(except for daily weighing) the chicks gradually decrease interactions with
the staff. They are released back into the flock at three months of age and
accept the adult birds readily. No apparent imprinting problems have been
noticed. Perhaps the biggest benefit to be gained from early weaning is the
reduced manpower need to hand rear the young.

BREEDING THE FULVOUS-BREASTED WOODPECKER
AT BIRDWORLD

We acquired our pair of Fulvous-breasted Woodpeckers Picoides macei
early in 1994 and at this time the pair were already mature with the female
showing a heavily bared brood patch possibly from previous breeding
attempts.
The pair were first housed in one of our Lorikeet aviaries, these being
fairly indestructible compared with other wooden framed aviaries. A few
horizontal perches were placed into the flight, but the birds predominantly
used upright logs which were attached to different sides of the aviary.
A straight forward softbill meal was fed to the birds each morning,
comprising chopped fruits, soaked Avi plus softbill mix, minced ox heart
and a few regular mealworms. All the food was minced and given a light
dusting with vitamins.
A single nest box measuring 30cms x 20cms x 20cms and lined with a
mix of dry peat and wood shavings was put up on the side of the flight
toward the back where it would be slightly sheltered. This box was used
mainly for roosting in, though the female spent many hours of the day
perching inside with only her head showing at the entrance.
By June 1994, the female still carried the bared brood patch which was
cause for a little concern as feathers were not showing any signs of growing
back. However on inspecting the nest box two eggs were found so it was
deemed that the pair must be quite settled and fit. The eggs having a very
thin shell allowed us to see instantly that they had been incubated for some
time, but showed no sign of fertility and hence were removed from the box.
No further breeding activity was noticed in 1994 and with the onset of
cold weather and the female still only partially feathered, it was deemed
prudent to move the birds into one of our Tropical House aviaries to over
winter, with every intention of returning them back to an on show flight
the following spring.
With a full moult being behind them the pair embarked on a new season
very early. Their nesting box which had been moved with them was checked
towards the end of February and found to have two fairly well developed
eggs inside. Unfortunately it appeared that the chicks had been eaten by
the hen nearly as soon as they had hatched.
The nest and indeed aviary, being off show was left as undisturbed as
possible, during the subsequent weeks. Feeding and cleaning the only
activities that would regularly upset the birds. The nest box was checked
once a week so that we could be sure if, and when, the eggs had been

produced and thus gauge an approximate hatch date. Live food was
increased in quantity and variety around the time the eggs were due to
hatch in an effort to prevent any further infanticide. Despite these efforts a
further six clutches of three eggs each were lost. The last having been seen
a day before hatching and left for just one more try. When we checked on
the hatch day, two had been devoured leaving a single infertile egg. It was
at this stage we decided to try hand rearing.
This is a situation that we had tried to avoid, having failed on every
attempt at hand rearing Woodpeckers in the past. On the 16th May, seven
days after the first egg had been laid, clutch eight was removed from the
nest and taken to the Incubation Research Station for artificial incubating.
Of four eggs measured in 1995 the average length was 21.34mm, the
width 15.99mm and the weight 2.767 grams. The shell thickness is a mere
twelfth of a millimetre. Incubated at a constant 37.5 degree C, the eggs
were turned automatically 96 times over each 24 hours, with an additional
5 turns given by hand during the day. Humidity was set at 84 degrees F.
(55% relative humidity) until the chicks pipped in to the air space of the
egg, when they were moved to a hatcher with maximum humidity and a
constant 36.5 degrees C. The whole incubation period was 10 days,
culminating in a tiny, blind and bald chick. The first chick hatched on the
19th May and was fed within hours of emergence. Kept in a moist brooder
set at 36 degrees C., the chick was fed every hour on mashed, skinless
cleaned maggots and mealworms mixed with tiny amounts of vitamins.
Begging responses were strong and plenty of food was taken. Feeding
stopped at eleven on the first night and resumed at seven the following
morning by which time the chick appeared very week and soon died. The
frustrations carried on as the second chick came and went almost as quickly
as the first. The third and final chick was treated similarly, but feeds were
spread out to every two hours. This was tried because we may have
previously been feeding them too much too soon and after all the chick still
had residual yolk to absorb. All was well with this method, at least for
three days when this chick was also lost. So far the mystery of rearing
woodpeckers from the egg remain a problem and will have to wait until
next year before it is tried again.
The ninth clutch we decided to try with an idea we had learned from
breeding the Yellow-fronted Woodpecker Melanerpes flovifrons in 1994
and that was to add a number of rotted logs into the aviary to encourage the
pair to produce their own nest chamber. Also as they seemed to be so
favourable to the nest box we thought of changing that too. In order to
allow the birds to build their own chamber the box was filled tight with a
mixture of wetted peat and bark chippings and after watching for a while
the male was having great difficulty removing any of the filling. A rethink

led to hollowing a chamber through the peat and chippings to a lOcms
diameter and about 23cms deep. This new chamber was then filled tight
with dampened wood shavings so the chamber depth could be designed by
the pair. Work began almost instantly, with the male pulling out wood
shavings from the box entrance till late in the evening. Within a few days
the shavings were removed leaving just the soiled chamber walls which
dried solid in the subsequent days.
Four eggs were seen on the 12th June and were obviously being sat
tight by the female as three could be seen to be fertile and close to hatching.
The nest was checked daily whilst the hen remained undisturbed and by
the 14th June one chick was seen in the box with mother and appeared to
be strong. Only the infertile egg accompanied the chick in the nest, there
was no sign of the other chicks, only broken shells.
Again the nest was checked each day to watch the chicks progress and
on each inspection it was a pleasure to see the chick become a day older
and growing well. Live feeding was kept up and increased daily, mainly
with mealworms and cleaned maggots, but occasionally crickets. Little
was observed as far as feeding was concerned, both parents were quite
nervous about entering the nest if they were being watched. However,
toward the latter part of the rearing, perhaps when the chick as becoming
more insistent, the parents could be observed from a distance. Still it was
difficult to see exactly what was happening, although the chick grew fast
and appeared, by early July to be about big enough to fledge, there was no
sign of the parents encouraging the youngster out. On the 9th July the
chick had indeed fledged and was watched in the afternoon being fed by
the male on a wall below the box.
The chick, so far as its plumage indicates, is a young hen differing
slightly from her mother by showing a slightly smaller mandible and slightly
shorter tail. Within a few days from fledging the new hen flew well with
its parents climbing strongly up logs and on the wire. She was not seen to
return to the nest box after fledging.
We would be grateful for information on hand rearing Woodpeckers
from any birdkeepers who have been successful with this challenge and
also if there are available Fulvous-breasted Woodpeckers in the UK for
exchanging blood lines.
As described above the Fulvous-breasted Woodpecker Picoides macei
was bred by Birdworld in 1995, and this is believed to be the first success
in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in Great Britain
or Northern Ireland, or of any other reason that would disqualify this claim,
is asked to contact the Hon. Secretary.

THE MEADOW PIPIT
By Rob Taylor
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9904202" page_id="56260935"  page_num="21" year="" vol="">
The Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis, at 5%in (15cm) long, is the smallest
of the Pipit family. Unlike the Redstart, featured in my last article, it is an
ideal subject for anyone breeding British softbills for the first time. The
British Bird Council's Softbill breeding programme takes account of this.
When I am approached, as secretary of the programme, by inexperienced
breeders asking for help to start with Redstarts, I advise them to gain
experience with Meadow Pipits before taking on anything so difficult.
Some fanciers are attracted by birds which are spotted and ticked while
other prefer brighter coloured birds, like Yellow Wagtails, Redstarts and
Wheatears. The " spotted and ticked " brigade need look no further than
the Meadow Pipit. The best description I can imagine is that it is like a
miniature Song Thrush. Anyone who likes Song Thrushes will love Meadow
Pipits.
The fact that Meadow Pipits are resident softbills means that their
requirements - housing and dietary - are easily met. There are no problems
of acclimatization or falling in a moult just as the breeding season is about
to begin. They can be housed as pairs in outside flights the whole year
round and there is no fighting between sexes. They are tough little birds
and once the first breeding season is over they go willingly to nest in
subsequent years. An added bonus is that they have, on average, three
nests of chicks each year. This gives a much greater chance of rearing
young than does a single brooding of the Redstart. One Wiltshire member
to the BBC has a line-bred family of Meadow Pipits that can be traced back
for five generations without the introducing of new blood. This
domestication has already brought about a noticeable increase in the size
of the individuals being produced.
Compared with some of the more difficult softbills, Meadow Pipit's
housing needs are not difficult to cater for a 2.7m x 1.8m flight is quite
adequate for a single pair and a larger enclosure could also house a breeding
pair of hardbills, such as Siskins, Redpolls or Twites. Breeding success
has been achieved in smaller flights and even large cages, though it would
take extensive experience on the parts of both the fanciers and the pair of
Meadow Pipits concerned before cage breeding is even attempted.
The Meadow Pipit is a moorland bird and so the closer the enclosures
resemble a small piece of Exmoor the happier I am. They are planted out
with grasses, both moorland and ornamental, heathers and a few small
firs. Although they are ground birds they require roosting quarters. I
provide these by fitting a slatted shield about 30cm below the flight roof.
Into the slots I wedge fir branches, bracken and heather. Some of my pairs
have preferred to nest at this height rather than on the ground.

TAYLOR - MEADOW PIPIT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997335068181818" page_id="56260936"  page_num="22" year="" vol="">
In between the grasses, firs and heathers small patches of bare earth are
left, where horse manure and grass cuttings can be placed to attract winged
insects. All that remains is to provide flitting posts; rotting tree stumps
and old fence posts, and flat stones. These offer vantage points from which
flying insects can be taken. No matter what one thinks of barbed-wire,
observation shows that most birds seem to enjoy perching on it. In
consequence, I have, at times, strung a piece of old barbed-wire across an
enclosure. The overall effect of grass clumps, firs, heathers, posts, stones
and even wire, is very natural. An uncovered roof is essential to keep the
enclosure fresh. A sudden squall of rain brings out many insects which
Meadow Pipits take eagerly.
Nests are built from dry grasses, with those of the finest texture being
used to form the lining. Animal hair is sometimes used to add a finishing
touch. Hidden among the heathers or built into the side of a grass tussock
nests are very well camouflaged. Four to six eggs are laid and these have
the appearance of miniature Blackbirds' eggs. The incubation period is
13 to 14 days. Meadow Pipits are very good parents and, in my aviaries,
invariably rear their own young, unlike my Redstarts which are always
hand-reared. It is a lovely sight to see four or five young Meadow Pipits
sitting on a post, still being fed by their parents.
Feeding is as undemanding as housing. Any good brand of proprietary
insectivorous food can form the basis of the diet. There are several on the
market. Into this I mix grated cheese (12mm cube for each pair) and a
similar amount of crumbled sponge cake. These additions, as well as adding
variety, make the proprietary mixture go further and help to keep down the
feeding costs. Twice a week a separate dish containing sweet biscuit (I use
rich tea) reduced to crumbs with the back of a fork, is offered and this is
taken with great enthusiasm. A pinch of small mealworms completes the
out-of-breeding season diet. Being residents, Meadow Pipits nest early
and so buffalo worms are offered from March onwards. The amount of
small mealworms is increased at the same time. If the enclosure is arranged
as described, the occupants will spend a lot of time on the ground, where
they will find plenty of live food.
The major problem to be faced with Meadow Pipits is a small one:
discovering which are cocks and which are hens - sexing. In appearance
the sexes are identical and so it is their songs that must be used for
identification. Once full breeding condition has been reached, the cocks
cannot help but sing, but in the lead up - which is the time that the
identification needs to be made - they can be shy; stopping singing as soon
as you approach their enclosure. I am fortunate that the lounge of my
house looks out onto the flights and so I can sit, unobserved, and watch my
Meadow Pipits behaviour through binoculars. That small difficulty apart,
the beautiful Meadow Pipit is an ideal subject for anyone considering taking
up breeding British softbills for the first time.

The Red-faced Liocichla Liocichla phoenicea has four races that come
from the Eastern Himalayas, Assam, North-west Thailand, S.W. China
and Northern Indochina. No colour plate has appeared in the Avicultural
Magazine, but the bird is illustrated on plate 23 of the Birds of China by
R. Mayer de Schauensee. It is approximately 23 cms. It is the only babbler
with sides of head and neck crimson, upperparts olive brown with centre of
belly olive. The tail is dusky olive, barred black at bottom. The colouring
when in breeding condition is wonderful to observe, but when not breeding
the birds can become drab in appearance.
It was early in 1987 that this bird appeared in any numbers on dealers
lists quite often with the Red-winged Laughing Thrush and the Red-tailed
Laughing Thrush. Our pair were exchanged for a pair of Rode bred Spreo
Starlings in late spring 1990. They couldn't be visually sexed and still
cannot except that we know which is the hen as the cock is slightly larger
in our pair.
They were housed in what is termed the bottom Peacock aviary being
approx. 6.25m x 6.25m x 2.5m high with a shelter at the back. The aviary
contained Elms and Berberis bushes and their fellow inmates were a pair
of Splendid Starlings, Schalow's Touracos and Grey Peacock Pheasants.
Their food consisted of mixed fruit, minced beef, spiked apple, Orlux
insectivorous mixture and the odd mealworm, plus any live food that they
caught in the enclosure.
The birds spent the winter of 1990/91 in this flight and nothing appeared
to be happening when on August 15th a single fledged chick was seen sat
on a front perch with its parents. By 1st September it was independent.
The aviary was searched to see where the nest had been. As the parents
had a habit of sitting in the bushes nothing was suspected. The nest was in
a clipped elm 1.2m above the ground, built on the outside twigs. It was IE-
shaped mainly built with grass lined with fine grass and moss.
Early in November it was surgically sexed by Andrew Greenwood and
was found to be a hen. It was kept inside during the winter and is now at
Paignton Zoo with one of their cock birds.
Once again during the winter of 1991/92 the parents were wintered
outside but they had access to their shelter. On 12th May the birds were
observed building a nest with grasses etc. We do not interfere with the
birds when the nest is difficult to observe, but on Friday 5th June three
eggs were seen. Five days later on 10th June 2 chicks were seen in the

nest. This nest again being in the middle of the aviary towards the back. A
single chick fledged on 3rd July and on 10th July it was taken inside where
it somehow managed to cut its foot and it had to be treated.
Another single egg was seen on 16th July with a chick being seen on
31st July when it was seen perching with its parents either side making a
tremendous amount of noise. This year when they had young we threw
mealworms, some crushed crickets and wax moth larva onto a patch of
grass where they had to be quick to beat the other inmates which in 1993
were a pair of Greater Hill Mynahs, Pink-crested Touracos and Grey peacock
Pheasants. The Pheasants were removed and a single chick was reared.
So 1991 produced a single bird reared with 1992, producing two. This is a
first breeding here at Rode and maybe we thought it was a UK first breeding
until, we read of the account in Foreign Birds by G. Massey Vol 58 no3.

Register of Birds Bred in the UK Under Controlled Conditions
for the Years 1991 -1994.
This annual register for 1994 published by the Foreign Bird Federation
is the tenth. Each year the numbers increase but still a lot of breeders both
public and private will not send in their returns. Once again Barry
Hammond of the Mealworm Company is the sponsor.
There are numerous UK first breedings including Yellow-faced Mynah,
Black-backed Fruit Dove, Red-Tailed Amazon and Roadrunner.
Birds of Prey are poorly represented considering the numbers offered
for sale in Cage and Aviary Birds. Cranes are better represented but there
must be a lot more Doves being bred than are recorded. Parrots make good
reading and for this the Parrot Society must be thanked for allowing their
members breeding records to be included.
Touracos in 1994 provided seven different species but in small numbers
despite the efforts of the International Touraco Society to stimulate interest.
Five species of Hombills was the best so far for this family. Laughing
Thrushes are proving to be ready nesters and it is encouraging to see the
Yellow-throated being bred.
Seedeaters are proving popular and not only the Australian where over
2000 Gouldian Finches are recorded. The Blue Waxbill group of breeders
must be pleased with their efforts especially getting 26 Violet-eared Waxbills
and 49 Purple Grenadier Waxbills to independence. A final mention of 25

PINK SPOTTED FRUIT DOVES

By J. Vella
In October 1992 my husband and I went to the East of England show at
Braintree, Essex. It was the first show we had attended and we were not
looking for anything in particular. However, we were drawn towards one
stand, which was displaying several pairs of Doves and Pigeons.
Our aviaries consist mainly of ground dwelling Quail, Partridge and
Pheasants, and we were fascinated by a pair of Pink Spotted Fruit Doves
Ptilinopus perlatus. Thinking they would make a colourful addition to the
upper area, we brought them.
Once home we fed them on chopped fresh fruit and Universal food.
Apple, banana and grapes formed the basis of their meal each day, with
other fruits of the season. We do not give them sharp citrus fruits - such as
orange or pineapple and they themselves have decided they are not keen on
blackberries. Their favourite fruits, by far, are bananas and cherries.
In winter when fruit is scarce, and expensive, their diet is supplemented
with dried mixed fruits which have been soaked overnight. They have a
preference for plain fruit, so we no longer add Universal, and something
they really enjoy - as a treat - are glace cherries.
The next year 1993 we didn't expect them to breed, as the cock bird
was rather immature. So in early spring we introduced them to their new
quarters a 1.8m x 1.8m x 1.8m outdoor flight where they lived happily
together all summer. In late October they were moved back into the covered
aviary, still a 1.8m x 1.8m flight, to protect them from the frosts.
As this flight is a little more secluded it was decided to leave them there
for the summer of 1994, in the hope that they might breed. They were
provided with several flat baskets, so that the hen could make her own
choice, and she soon laid her first egg.
We had been advised that fruit doves only lay one egg and that both
birds take equal turns to incubate it. The next morning the hen was sitting,
and she continued to sit for most of the time only leaving the nest to
relentlessly chase her mate. She chased him to such an extent that at one
stage we really thought she would kill him. He would not take his turn to
sit, and after a week, she left the nest completely. We candled the egg and
found it to be infertile. This behaviour continued all summer, but with
both birds now talking turns sitting. Unfortunately not one egg was fertile.
That winter, although still in the same aviary, they were moved to a
small 1.8m x 0.9m unit nearer the heat source, as the frosts were severe.
Despite their confined space the hen began laying again in February of
this year (1995). As this time she made no attempts to sit we removed the

egg, only to have her lay another a few days later. Then, one day, there
were two eggs. The problem solved, we had two hens.
We were fortunate enough to obtain a surgically sexed cock bird and, in
March, we introduced him to the hens in the hope that they might form a
breeding trio. However, the cock paired with the older hen and they objected
to the presence of the younger bird. She was removed to the flight next
door. Unfortunately, as yet, we have been unable to obtain a mate for her.
Our pair soon chose a nest basket and laid the first egg. They took
turns at incubating it but, unfortunately, with only hours to hatching they
left the nest. Although the egg was cold we placed it in our incubator and,
against all odds, the next morning it had hatched.
Now we had a problem of how and what to feed it. Never having kept
Doves before we made many telephone calls for advice, but no one could
help. We therefore tried to crop feed the chick with pulped fruit, but sadly
after 4 days it died.
Soon our hen laid again. By the seventeenth day we were both nervously
checking every few hours, making sure the nest was still attended. On the
morning of the eighteenth day an empty shell lay on the floor. Hopefully
she was now sitting on a healthy chick.
Every day we expected to find a chick on the floor, dead, but our fears
were unfounded and the doves proved to be excellent parents.
It was twelve days later that the youngster emerged from the safety of
the nest. It was a perfect miniature of the parents, minus the pink spots.
This came as a surprise to us as we had been expecting the fledgling to be
almost fully grown like a Racing Pigeon.
Both parent birds fed the chick and it grew very quickly. Their fruit
was now being diced finely in preparation for the chick to feed itself. It is
now thirteen weeks old, and almost as big as its parents.
We are hoping that the chick is a cock bird so that we can pair it with
our single hen next season.
Although the weather has now turned cooler, and the days are shorter,
our pair have mated again, and they have been incubating for four days.
With luck we may have another Pink Spotted Fruit Dove chick this season.

The Victoria Crowned Pigeon Goura victoria is one of three species
which comprise the genus Goura. The other two species are the Blue-
crowned Pigeon Goura cristata and the Maroon-breasted Pigeon Goura
scheepmakeri. Briefly, the differences in coloration can be summarised as
follows: the Blue-crowned Pigeon is completely blue with maroon bars on
the wings and a frothy blue crest, Scheepmaker's Crowned Pigeon has a
maroon breast and white crest which looks like spun nylon fibres, while
the Victoria-crowned Pigeon has a maroon breast and a crest like a blue
doily with semi-circular fronds tipped with white. The Crowned Pigeons
come from the islands of New Guinea.*
A single bird (DNA sexed as female) was obtained from Rex Merritt
(an English importer) in October 1994. This bird was part of a consignment
which had come from the Wildlife Breeding Centre on the Philippines.
Viewing the group, the majority of the pigeons rushed away from visitors
to the far side of the holding area, this particular female however not only
strode purposefully towards them but directed an enthusiastic welcome
apparently towards the visiting shoes. In this procedure, which must form
part of the courtship ritual, the bird bows its head touching its forehead on
the ground and utters a hollow booming sound, while fanning its tail.
Beeton's Book of Poultry and Domestic Animals (cheap edition),
published at an unspecified date in the nineteenth century has some
interesting comments on the Crowned Pigeon. "They are easily tamed,
and in the East Indies are frequently kept in a farmyard, among the ducks
and geese. They have all the habits of the common little pigeon, and bill
and coo like the most ordinary 'runt'. The cooing, however, is a trifle
more violent than that of the English species. Indeed., M. Bourgainville
relates that his sailors were greatly alarmed on hearing it, for the first time,
in the wild and unfrequented spots of some of the islands visited by him,
apprehending that the mysterious sounds proceed from tribes of lurking
savages lying in ambush, presently to fall on them and devour them."
While Derek Goodwin in Pigeons and Doves of the World believed that
only the male engages in this booming behaviour, and Brian Coates in the
Birds of Papua New Guinea is unsure whether it is a determinant of sex,
successful breeders confirm that both sexes bow to each other, although the
males may be a little more vocal about it than the females. In the case of
this particular female who is extremely tame and was obviously hand-reared
the bowing is stimulated by shoes the heavier and more masculine in style

the better. Probably there is some kind of association between shoes and
the handrearer.
Although doves and pigeons are generally regarded by aviculturists as
amongst the least intelligent species, observations of this particular bird
does not support this. At the time of purchase, it was too cold for the
pigeon to go directly outside, and so it was simply released into the house
where it had to confront three dogs, various people and other birds.
Initially it was much alarmed, took off, flew round the living room and
landed on the top of the bookshelf three metres up the wall. However, in a
remarkably short time - within a week - it had adjusted to the dogs (who
ignored it) and while not initially seeking their company (as it later did) it
would walk past them raising its wings in a defensive gesture common to
all pigeons.
During those first few weeks although the bird ate well and appeared
lively it did suffer from enteritis, with droppings which were runny and
green. Although a specimen sent for analysis tested sensitive to a number
of antibiotics, there was not actually much response to any of them.
Eventually the condition seemed to clear up without any medication apart
from the addition of a probiotic to the food. Although some kind of bacterial
infection was present, the symptoms seem to have been a response to the
stresses of a new situation. This assumption is supported by the fact that
when the pigeon was eventually moved to an outside aviary, precisely the
same thing happened.
The Victoria Crowned Pigeon proved to be very sensitive to change
generally. Since it was too big to confine to a cage, it was during its life
indoors, free to wander through the sitting rooms, hall and kitchen. Once
familiarised with the routine it sought company, preferably human, but
dog if no human alternative was available. This meant that mornings were
generally spent in the kitchen where the bird food was being prepared.
The Pigeon would peck happily around on the floor picking up random
bits of seed and fruit, disregarding its own dish until after everything else
had gone. Once activity in the kitchen ceased, it spent most of the rest of
the day in the sitting room with the dogs, wandering around, or perching
on the back of chairs. At night it roosted always in the same place on the
back of the sofa ignoring the television. This routine was followed everyday,
however a large piece of plasterboard which was left in the hall against the
banisters was sufficiently strange to make the bird remain in the sitting
room without attempting to cross the hall to the kitchen. It ate and drank
nothing since the food and water dishes were in the kitchen and only when
the plasterboard was removed after a couple of days could it be persuaded
to venture out again.

As the months of winter passed, the Pigeon became increasingly
territorial and aggressive. While it appeared tolerant of, even responsive
to, the dogs and was never seen to attack them, it had no hesitation in
pecking repeatedly the legs and feet of less favoured household inhabitants.
It is difficult to know what aroused this aggression as it seemed fairly
inconsistent. Certainly bare feet and sandals provoked it, and it did not
seem to matter whose they were. It would seem that these birds are
stimulated by immediate visual impressions and are unable, as a parrot
would be, to recognise individuals as entities apart from their clothing.
Any attempts to push it away or shut it out of the room was met on these
occasions with raised wings and pecks on the hand.
The bird seemed to identify with the dogs more fully as time went on.
It followed them around, roosted nearby where they slept in the day and
even "played" with the puppy. These games involved picking up and
shaking the end of the dog's lead while the puppy tugged at the other end,
and running after and carrying away a little ball when it was thrown.
It was difficult to assess how much of this was intelligent behaviour.
The large red eyes of these birds are constantly watchful, but how much of
the interaction with the rest of the household is consistent with actual
awareness is difficult to say. Certainly the Pigeon, like all animals responded
to routine and appeared to resent alterations to it. When, for instance, it
was shut out of the living room during a tea party, it paced about outside
the door for over an hour. There is no doubt that it sought and enjoyed
company and when left alone would patrol up and down as stressed animals
do booming repeatedly and disconsolately.
Although the diet of these pigeons is basically one of seeds, (com, small
seeds, sunflower, hulled peanuts and safflower), they also enjoy fruit -
particularly diced apple - and some egg food. Vegetables, cooked or raw
and grated are thrown around but rarely seem to be eaten. Livefood also is
largely ignored. As is the habit of pigeons, the seed is flicked from side to
side as the birds hunts through it for some favoured morsel. This pigeon
drinks very deeply, and rather than simply taking drops it is possible to see
the level in the water bowl reduce as the bird takes in the liquid.
When finally transferred to an outside flight prior to pairing (two birds
of this size indoors was one too many) it spent much more time on perches
than on the floor of the flight. Like many floor walkers these birds have
delicate feet and are susceptible to frost bite. It was not until a mate was
obtained for it that it actually spent any time on the floor, roosting at night
on a perch.
These large pigeons appear to have soft fringed feathers on the chest
and neck, but all parts of the plumage, both back and front, are very resistant
to water, even heavy rain just rolls off them as if they were waterproofed

and neither the crest nor the body feathers show signs of saturation although
they may feel damp. Having said this, the birds are moved inside during
wet and cold nights. This involves placing an arm against their legs at the
back so they step on it and can be thus transported from their regular
outside perch into a house. They have never roosted inside by themselves.
J.G. Wood quoted in Beeton's Book of Poultry describes a bird from the
Zoological Gardens sunning itself. "They have a quaint habit of sunning
themselves upon the hot pavement of their prison, by lying on one side,
laying the head flat on the ground, tucking the lower wing over them, and
spreading the other over their bodies, so as to form a very shallow tent,
each quill feather being separated from its neighbour and radiating round
the body. Sometimes the bird varies this attitude, by stretching the other
wing to its full extent, and holding it from the ground at any angle of 20&apos;
degrees or so, as if to take advantage of every sunbeam and every waft of
air. While lying in this unique attitude, it might easily pass at a little
distance, for a moss covered stone, a heap of weathered leaves or a ragged
tree stump, with one broken branch projecting to the side". I have never
witnessed this behaviour, although sun bathing is common in ground
pigeons like the Bleeding-hearts and Golden-hearts.
These birds although very large and somewhat clumsy have never shown
any aggression to the other birds which share their aviary. However this
does not necessarily mean that they do not possess a forceful and at times
dominating personality.

BREEDING THE SPLENDID STARLING
By Stewart Pyper

<bodyText confidence="0.989726078947368" page_id="56260945"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
The Splendid Starling Lamprotornis splendidus is the largest and the
most beautiful of the short tailed Glossy Starlings. It extends in range
from Nigeria across Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Congo, Angola
and into Northern Zimbabwe. It is said not to be a common bird, but it is
very vocal, appearing to be able to mimic certain noises. It is a very large
Starling approx. 30cms in length.
The bird is difficult to depict in a colour illustration. The colour plate
in Vol 88 No. 4 (1982 - Softbill issue) although depicting the general shape
of the bird with its very distinctive white eye ring does not show the correct
coloration. The male's plumage is almost all metallic so when the bird is
caught in the sun its chest and throat can be seen to be purple, becoming
bluer as you move down to the belly. The females are generally smaller
with the purple being blue. The birds greatly enjoy calling. The cock puffs
up his throat feathers and at times his call seems almost alike a human
voice.
The Splendid Starling was first bred in the country by Raymond Sawyer
at Cobham in 1976. The Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode bred them in 1987
and Leeds Castle are also said to have been successful. It is believed that
our late President, Jean Delacour, had the first world breeding in 1974.
The bird has never been common in captivity. It is mentioned in the
Avicultural Magazine in 1925 and not again until 1975. The first time that
most members will have seen the species is at Cobham in the collection
kept by Ruth Ezra and Raymond Sawyer.
I was very interested in this Starling and hoped that one day the
opportunity to own and breed them would occur. In 1985 Rex Merritt, a
member of the Society, imported approx. 14 birds. Mike Curzon, a director
at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode told me of them and I asked for two
pairs if possible as he was having the same number. On 3rd December
they were collected and put into an indoor flight 1.6m x 1.2m x 1.8m
where they spent the winter. The food at the importer had been mainly
pellets and crumbs. I offered Orlux softbill food plus some Claus, fruit in
season and some mealworms. This they readily took to. There was a dish
for bathing and this was extensively used for the first few days.
Around Christmas I had time to study the birds and came to the
conclusion that all were hens. They all looked very similar. There was no
sign of purple on the throat or breast but all would enjoy calling. Rode had
the bad luck to loose a cock from their two pairs so we had a single cock
and six hens between us. In 1986 a few more Splendid Starlings were

imported but mostly in pairs. I know of a single male being obtained by a
sharp eyed exhibitor who spotted it amongst a group of Purple Glossy
Starlings at a dealer's premises.
In April 1986 the four Splendid Starlings were put into an aviary 3.7m
x 3.7m 1.8m high with an open fronted shelter at the rear. The aviary had
been rebuilt in the early Spring. Over the years this is what has happened
to the birds

The cock has only got its right eye. Whilst with Raymond Sawyer it
had young but the chick and its mother were killed with the male losing its
left eye. What did this is not known, but I knew it was a fertile cock. These
birds do appear to be long lived as my original hen had been with me for
over eight years when she reproduced. Raymond Sawyer's first breeding
pair had been with him for over 12 years before they bred.
Over the years the birds have generally had the same flight especially
the original hen. Some time has been spent inside in the Winter but with
the generally milder winters in recent years the birds have spent most of
their time outside. Christmas 1993 brought bad weather and the birds
were brought indoors where they spent over three months until put out at
Easter 1994. I believe that if there are prolonged cold spells their feet
could be affected.
Nesting had taken place in 1992 and in 1993 eggs were produced. 1994
saw the birds choose an alternative box. The birds in the aviary in 1994
were an old pair of Mountain Witch Doves, three Chestnut-tailed Sivas
and a single Meve's Starling. Food was still generally the same except that
Claus was only used infrequently, and nowadays not at all. It became
expensive and difficult to obtain. Sometimes Bogena and Haith's
insectivorous foods are offered as well. Waxmoths are given at times. A
home made nectar is available and is now taken every day.
The aviary has a Yew bush which is cut back each year.There are 2 nest
boxes, the one chosen being at an angle of 60 degrees from the vertical
40cms x 20cms x 20cms with a 5cm hole. A short perch is fitted near the
rear entrance hole to help entering. Coconut fibre, grass (both fine and
coarse) plus some feathers were carried into the box by both birds and a
dish shaped nest was made.They enjoy, as do a lot of the Glossy Starlings,

pulling small green leafs from any plant in their aviary. Sometimes a few
branches are put in during the early summer so that they can continue with
this habit, and some of the leaves or shoots are taken into the nest box. It
served its purpose because two eggs were laid by 6th June. My father
established this by feeling them. Incubation is believed to be 17 to 19 days.
These two eggs were not removed for observation but the eggs from 1993
were looked at and found to be typical Starling i.e. blue with brown markings.
They were not measured. On Wednesday 20th June when the birds were
being fed in the morning the cock was seen to take mealworms to the nest
box. Suspecting that young had hatched my father supplied more during
the day. A supply of mini mealworms had been brought in anticipation of
an attempted breeding.
Over the next few days mealworms were taken to the nestbox. By careful
listening it was thought to be two chicks. A torch was used to look into the
box via the entrance hole and a single chick could be seen although it
sounded like there were still two in the nestbox.
On Sunday 10th July the first youngster left the nest, with its mate the
next day, which points to the eggs being laid on successive days. Waxmoth
larvae were also being given before they had left the nest. Their proud
parents looked after them. They could fly very well and thankfully we had
no cloud bursts to cause problems. Their water dish had been an upturned
plastic dustbin lid which had fresh water every other day. When the chicks
left the nest the water was reduced in case this caused any problems. How
often do we hear that water causes the death of newly fledged birds?
I was interested to observe what the youngsters would be. One was
quite a bit larger than the other like its parents. Cocks are generally thought
to be the larger and very soon the purple feathers of the cock's front could
be clearly seen. This was seen within a month. The other was a hen.
The parents and their young lived together with no further attempts at
breeding. The young cock went to the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode on
Saturday 11th March 1995. The young hen was put in an aviary with other
birds but could be seen and heard by her parents when calling. A cock is
required for her. In 1995 nest building was minimal and breeding did not
take place. The young cock at Rode mated with their breeding hen but no
young were hatched. My pair were brought in at Christmas and have spent
the winter indoors being put out on Sunday 14th April. Their breeding
nest box has been replaced with a similar sized box and hopefully they will
reproduce later this summer.

BREEDING THE RED-BILLED BLUE MAGPIE AT THE
TROPICAL BIRD GARDENS, RODE
By Mike Curzon
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994804972972973" page_id="56260948"  page_num="34" year="" vol="">
The Red-billed Blue Magpie Urocissa erythrorhyncha is a well known
bird in aviculture. It was first bred in 1914 at Lilford Park (A.M. 1916:70),
and it has been bred numerous times since. There has been no colour plate
in the Avicultural Magazine. The bird is about 66cm overall in length of
which about 46cm is accounted for by the tail. The basic colourings are
black, blue and white against the red of the bill, legs and feet making a
conspicuous contrast. Sexes are similar but size can vary in some pairs.
The birds come for the Himalayas, Assam, Burma, North Vietnam and
China: there are 5 races. Jean Delacour told me that he saw them in and
around Peking when he was in China between the world wars.
In recent times Boehm bred them in 1960 at Trenton, New Jersey USA.
Charles Everitt (A.M. 1960:226) describes this breeding of the Occipital
Blue Pies presumably referring to the Himalayan race. 5 were reared and
Everitt asked if this had been recorded before. Also Everitt was attached
by the cock which scared his forehead.
The Red-billed Blue Magpie has in the past been kept at liberty in some
of the larger collections. Although we have successfully kept several species
of Macaws at liberty I have deep reservations about trying this out with a
Magpie. It would probably stray and be killed by being shot. The problem
of people misusing their guns will continue to be with us all. There is a
note in the Avicultural Magazine (1970:38) from one of Donald Risdon's
oldest friends, Ken Norris, on his escaped Red-billed Blue Magpie. The
bird (his cock) escaped in June and was recaptured in mid November. Ken
had not seen the bird during that time, but it had moulted and was perfect.
He had obviously "lived off the land", and enjoyed himself.
The Red-billed Blue Magpie has always been a popular bird with our
visitors here at the Tropical Bird Gardens, Rode, as it moves around it's
aviary. It has been bred on numerous occasions over the last thirty years
being easy to feed and hardy. They must be kept on their own or with birds
that can defend themselves. If other occupants were to nest the Magpie
might be tempted to eat the eggs or the young.
The reason for this article is about a very prolific pair, the young of
which have been exchanged or sold to various collections over the last four
years. Red-billed Blue Magpies are well known birds in avicultural
collections both private and public. They are hardy, long lived and stand a
good chance of reproduction. They do best in large flights. For the keeper
of a small collection who had a collection of small birds I wouldn't suggest

putting these birds in an adjoining aviary as they would be frightened.
The subjects of this article have a large flight being 23 metres long and
10 metres deep and averaging 5 metres high. They share it with a pair of
English bred Secretary Birds. The Magpies are able to be seen in all their
splendour as they glide along from end to end. &apos;There is a shelter at one
end approx. 3.5. metres off the ground, where they could go if they wished.
It was thought that they might make their nest there; but no, they decided
to build it at the opposite end approx. 4 metres above the ground. It is a
typical Magpie nest looking unsafe, but doing its job.
Generally four or five eggs are laid on alternative days. Incubation is
done by both with the hen doing the greater percentage of this. It is about
12 days. This does vary a day either side but regular inspections are not
welcomed by the parents. The young have in addition to their parents
normal food, hard boiled egg (mashed) and day old chicks. Just before
they can fly at 3 weeks, they are taken away. By this I mean the eldest, so
if there are five young, there can be an eight day difference. All birds are
then finished off hand reared, but this is relatively easy as they readily
accept food and grow well. They are not small birds at this stage of
development and you could feed them with almost anything. We use minced
beef with pheasant starter crumbs, Orlux insectivorous mixture and hard
boiled eggs. This is rolled into little balls and eagerly consumed. Approx,
feeding times are 7.00am, 8.00am, 11.00am, 1,00pm, 3.30pm, 5.00pm and
9 - 9.30pm.
The young are a dull version of their parents without the long tail.
Already this year there is a single independent youngster and at the time of
writing (Monday 19th June 1995) they are down on eggs again. From
1992 until the present 32 have been reared. The birds are surgically sexed
in the autumn by Andrew Greenwood. The largest nest has been five and
of this the most of one sex has been four. Over the years cocks and hens
have balanced out.
The reason for hand rearing has been the presence in the aviary of the
Secretary Birds. In 1992 the first youngster left the nest, flew down and
was pounced on and killed. The other four were then removed and this is
the reason for removing them when the eldest chick is about 21 days.
The young when reared are kept in an open top brooder with some heat
being provided at times, e.g. if early in the year before the weather becomes
warm and/or hot. It was hoped to establish a second pair in a smaller flight
with one of our cocks and a hen from Paulton Park, but the hen died earlier
this year for no apparent reason. A replacement is being obtained this
autumn.

The Yellow-fronted Tinkerbird Pogoniulus chrysoconus is a small
African Barbet with a general distribution from Senegal to North-western
Ethiopia, Uganda and Zaire. There has been no colour plate in the
Aviculutural Magazine. Its size is approximately 1 lcms. A brief description
is a yellow forecrown, a lemon yellow rump with a yellowish edge to some
feathers including a huffish yellow belly. There are also white, black and
buff colours all combining to make a rather starker coloured bird in
comparison to some of its more gaudy relatives. The male's bill in our pair
is thicker and the yellow on the bird is more intense than the female when
in breeding conditions. When they are out of breeding conditions they are
alike.
There appears to be no previous references to the Yellow-fronted
Tinkerbird in the Avicultural Magazine. Its close relative, the Red-fronted
Tinkerbird is mentioned when it was imported in 1930 and in the wild in
1958. It was in the late 1980's that a small number of Tinkerbirds were
imported but no breeding reports have been published.
Our birds were purchased from a dealer in the Spring of 1993. Their
accommodation consists of an inside flight 1.8m wide x 3.6m long x 1.8m
high at the front increasing to 2.25m at the back. There is a sloping roof. It
is block built onto an old brick wall and half the front is glass. The roof of
the inside is corrugated perspex. In winter the temperature is maintained
at between 50* to 55*F. On occasions in winter there is a supplementary
light from 6am to 8pm on a time switch. The birds have fought but now
with more cover this no longer occurs. The cock was taken away in order to
reduce his condition. On to the back brick wall is a double breeder and he
was put in this for some time. This cage acts as a release cage for new
birds.
Some of the plants inside include Plumbago auriciata (Cape Leadwort)
a good climber which goes all the way to the roof via a log and cuts off
about a third of the flight: Datura (Angels Trumpet) and Cassia corynbosa.
Other occupants at the time of nesting were pairs of Rodensingus,
Lavender Finch, Femando-Po Mannikin, Black-naped Fruit Pigeon, Cape
Dove, 4 Red-headed Tits, a hen Roulroul Partridge and a single Chestnut-
flanked Zoestrop. The Roulroul always roosts next to the night light and
therefore gets some extra warmth as this is on all the time.
The birds also have access to a large landscaped flight, the dimensions
are 3.6m x 3.6m x 2.25m high, which has been well planted with many
different shrubs, grasses and ferns. This gives the birds a more interesting

environment, which in turn we hope will encourage breeding. There are
also many a large logs (potential nest sites), and a small shallow pond
which is situated on the top of a walled raised border, planted with dwarf
shrubs and ground cover plants.
Some of the plants used are:-
Lonicera nitida "Baggesens Gold" - a good shrub for nest cover.
Viburnum davidii - a small evergreen shrub which copes with light
shade.
Photinia x Fraseri "Red Robin" - large laurel like shrubs, the new growth
is red.
Chosiya temata "Mexican Orange Blossom"- medium sized with
fragrant white flowers
Matteuccia struthioptiris "Ostrich Feather Fern" - has beautiful feathery
fronds (leaves).
The foods available were grapes and soaked sultanas (cut very small),
apples, bananas, Orlux insectivorous mixture and mealworms. Obviously
in the summer other livefood would enter the aviary, especially earwigs.
This summer was very hot and we were plagued by wasps which in fact eat
the mealworms at times.
The previous year (1994) the Tinkerbirds had played at nesting, spending
a great deal of time burrowing into a lime log. This lime log is quite soft
being 60cms x .25cms diameter. It is 23cms from the roof to the top of the
log. Halfway along the underside is the entrance to the nest. This hole had
been dug in 1994. Other suspended logs were burrowed but only for about
5cms. Could they have been searching for grubs or perhaps practising ?
We are certain that there was a failed attempt early in the summer of
1995, when both birds went missing for some time. During July another
attempt was underway. They were the dominant birds in the flight when
seen. There were extra mini mealworms given and on Sunday 6th August
there were 3 Tinkerbirds in the inside flight. The young bird was a paler
version of its parents especially its yellow colouration. Since the bird fledged
the Red-headed Tits now are the "top dogs" and incidentally each morning
these Tits drink from the nectar dish.
We will not be splitting the log to examine the nest. The log was roughly
positioned north to south. You are able to put your finger in the hole for
about 2.5cm before it turns right. It was not easy to find a suitable lime log.
There is a bigger log in the outside flight. After 6 weeks the youngster was
removed into a small 1.2m x 61cm x 1.8m high flight inside where it lives
with a pair of Grey-checked Parrotbills which have been brought inside
from their flight for the winter. Incidentally the young bird is a cock.The
Parrotbills built a nest in a Buxus sempervirens "Common box" 30 cmsfrom

the ground. It was washed out in a rare summer thunderstorm for 1995.
A few further points are that we never saw the birds mating and have
never seen an egg. They dislike rain as they go inside but will stay outside
in drizzle. An adjoining aviary had a pair of Blue-crowned Hanging Parrots
that reared a single youngster and a hen Yellow-winged Sugarbird.
Early this year (1996) another youngster fledged. The parents used the

The young birds are being sent to London Zoo. If any member knows of
other Yellow-fronted Tinkerbirds please could they contact us here at Rode.
As described above the Yellow-fronted Tinkerbird Pogoniulus
chrysoconus was bred by M &amp; N. Curzon in 1995 and this is believed to be
the first success in this country. Anyone knowing of a previous breeding in

This was the society's third visit - the previous years being 1986 and 1991.
Despite the long hot dry summer the lawns had a touch of green about
them as it has rained on the Thursday evening. There were a few drops of
rain in the morning but we had a lovely warm afternoon.
Before describing the birds a few notes must be penned reference the
rest of the collection. There are approx. 200 tortoises of various forms
from the small to the large giant tortoises. It is believed to the most
comprehensive in the country, perhaps even in Europe. They have access
to heated indoor shelters. The heat comes from lamps which helps to
maintain the temperature in inclement weather. They have a varied diet
and several have successfully reproduced, Ken was able to point out that if
certain vitamins are not available or are consumed in too great a quantity,
it effects the shell. There are various mammals including Morai and
Wallabies. Recently Ken has added a new large paddock. The gardens are
always a joy and there are various greenhouses, one of which is devoted to
ferns. Of historical interested to members there is a Pamianthe handed
from Major Pam to Alfred Ezra OBE, to Raymond Sawyer to Ken Dolton.
Four members to whom the Society owe a great deal.
It is Parrots that Ken is best known for. Altogether there are 121 aviaries
all having various types of shelters. Amongst the birds noticed were
Hyacinth, Scarlet, Military and Buffon's Macaws, various Cockatoos,
including a magnificent pair of Leadbeaters. There were Australian and
Amboina Kings, Lesser Vasa Parrots, Blue-throated and Queen of Bavaria
Conures, plus a varied selection of Australian Parakeets. Lories were well
represented including Duyvenbode's, Stellas, and Blue Streaked. Many
species had bred and some pairs still had young with them. Having a large
number of flights, Ken is able to keep a selection of singletons in case of
emergency. It is always a pleasure to see Thick-billed Parrots for which
Ken was awarded the Society's Medal in 1969 for the first breeding in
Great Britain. Numerous Amazons were seen including Yellow- naped,
Green-cheeked and Double Yellow-headed.
There is a large selection of waterfowl including all seven species of
Swans, There were also Crowned and Demoiselle Cranes, As always time
was short to do the collection full justice. Out thanks to Ken and Mona for
allowing us into their beautiful home and gardens.

Three species of birds considered "lost" have been rediscovered recently
in Indonesia. In May 1995 the Invisible Rail Habroptila ( Rallus) wallacii
was observed by an Indonesian ornithologist in a sago swamp on the island
of Halmahera. Second in August 1995 two British ornithologists
successfully rediscovered the Lampobathong Flycatcher Ficedula bonthaina
in south Sulawesi. Finally a Caerulean Paradise Flycatcher Eutrichomyias
rowleyi was recorded on Sangihe island (see item later in News &amp; Views).
The latter species was believed extinct while the other two are rediscoveries
of species not seen in the wild for a number of years.

A study of the Scaly-breasted Merganser Mergus squamatus has been
carried out at Xiao Xingangling mountain in north eastern China. The
mountain is one of the main afforested areas in north eastern China and is
an important breeding area for the species. The Scaly-sided Merganser
was frequently seen some years ago along the Tan Wang river and its
tributaries, the Cue Ulan, Ann Tea and Yong Cue rivers. Numbers have
been drastically reduced with deforestation, illegal hunting and human
disturbance given as the main causes. Suggestions have been made that a
nature reserve be established in the Yong Cue river area as this now seems
to be the main breeding area.

Since August 1995, the Danish Ministry for the Environment has
financed the Khao Nor Chuchi project in Thailand. It is working with
villages to demarcate their land holdings in order to define boundaries
between cultivated areas and forest, and to help establish the marketing of
green vegetables which are in demand locally and in the larger towns. A
conservation management board has been set up which will bring together
all appropriate officials to consider in detail conservation and development
activities at the site. Khao Nor Chuchi is one of the few locations where
the highly endangered Gurney's Pitta. Pitta gumeyi is still to be found.

Since 1988 Birdlife International has run a collaborative Recovery
Programme with the Government of Seychelles and the owner of Fregate
Island to conserve the endemic Seychelles Magpie Robin Copsychus
sechellarum. The species reached a low of 17 birds some 6 years ago.
After the implementation of a series of measures numbers have risen to 60,
most of which are still found on Fregate, the largest rat- and cat-free island
in the Seychelles.
However, on 11th September 1995, a single brown rat was discovered
and subsequent details reveal that a small colony is now established. A
programme is now being undertaken to eradicate the rats in-situ. If this
fails more drastic measures will be adopted, even to the point of holding all
birds in captivity until all rats have been destroyed.

Many members will remember the Programme for Belize started in the
late 1980's with the aim of raising money to buy and then to manage an
area of rainforest in northern Belize. Over 20,000 people worldwide
supported the undertaking and the goals are well on the way to being met.
The success has led to the formation of the World Wide Land Conservation
Trust which now, not only continues to oversee the efforts in Belize, but
has also instigated two new projects; one on the Osa Peninsular, Costa
Rica and the other on Danjugan Island in the Philippines. Further
information can be obtained from W.W.L.C.T., Blyth House, Bridge St.,
Halesworth, Suffolk, IP 19 8AB.
Despite an embargo on exports to Iran, efforts by government officials
and international researchers cleared the way for two Siberian Cranes Grus
leucogeranus reared at the International Crane Foundation's headquarters
at Baraboo, U.S.A. to be sent to Iran to bolster the western flock of this
endangered species that has for two decades clung to a population of between
eight and eleven birds. Only two other flocks are known, one that winters
in India may be reduced to a single pair while the Chinese population of
around 3000 winters on the Yangtze river.

The article by Dr. Karl Shuker (A.M. 1992:27) on the attempted
introduction of Tinamou on to Brightlingsea marshes at the turn of the
century made interesting reading. The family as a whole was well
represented in U.K. collections with between eight and ten species
mentioned in various articles published in the Avicultural Magazine around
that time.
Interest in this group has waned since then and until recently only the
Chilean Nothopmcta perdicaria was present in the U.K. breeding in several
collections. Vigour certainly seems to have dropped away in recent years
and the introduction of new blood is vital if the species is to be maintained.
Three other species are presently in the U.K., Crested Eudromia elegans
and Red-winged Rhynehotus rufescens are kept at Beale Park while the
third, kept privately in Norfolk has yet to be identified.

male Thick-billed Parrot Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha which was the
remaining one of the pair which I obtained from San Diego Zoo in 1966
died in February this year.
This bird had been totally blind, first with cataracts and then the eyelids
closed altogether for the last two years, but it had no difficulty in finding
food and water in his aviary and in his cage in the bird room in which he
lived for the last two months of his life.

The San Diego Zoo has a pair of Javan Rhinoceros Hombills, housed in
an enclosure at the base of Sun Bear Forest. They have also been successful
in breeding these rare birds - five chicks have hatched since May 1992.
This success was probably due in the large part of the care the keepers took
in providing the birds with just the right nesting cavity, in which the female
sealed herself up contentedly, just as in the wild.

The University of York Exploration Society's expedition to the Sangihe
and Talaud islands in August, September and October of 1995 was very
successful. The Expedition was put together by Jon Riley from the University
of York and the area was suggested by Birdlife International.
The team consisted of five students from the University of York and
five students from the University of San Sam Ratulangi (Manafo, Sulawesi),
along with two aviculturists from the United States. The aims were to find
and check the status of a number of endemic species that are considered
rare and/or endangered as well as to do transects and point counts on the
islands to check the avifauna and forests.
One of the members of the team saw the critical endangered Caerulean
Paradise Flycatcher, the third time it has been seen in 100 years. Also on
Sangihe the nominate race of the Red and Blue Lory Eos h. histrio was
seen and which was thought to be extinct. 6 birds were seen and from a
former trapper it was learned that possibly a total of 30 specimens of the
Lory remain in the area. The Sangihe Hanging Parrot and the Elegant
Sunbird which are considered endangered were seen in the southern part
of the island where they are locally common.
On Karakelong, the largest island in the Talaud's, the sub-species of
the Red and Blue Lory talautensis was found to be more numerous than
originally had been expected. Also a single Grey Imperial Pigeon D,
pickeringii was seen and it was a pet of one of the trappers we spoke with.
We were also able to confirm that the Talaud Kingfisher Halcyon enigma
which was formerly thought to be a sub-species of Halcyon chloris is indeed
a full species as both species were seen in the same habitat.
Three of the most common birds in the Talaud's were the Black Sunbird,
the Pacific Swallow, followed by the Grey-sided Flowerpecker and in fourth
spot the Tree Sparrow.

writes Nick Atchinson in the January issue of Australian Aviculture. The
article emphasises the importance of diet in maintaining these birds in
captivity. Chopped fruit on its own is not enough. The birds have access to
Wombaroo Lorikeet and Honeyeater food that they drink from a bowl. Trials
using an imported fruit eating bird pellet have proved successful and will
be incorporated into their regular diet soon.

In September 1995 I visited Le Jardin des Oiseaux Parc Omithologique
de Spay situated 10 kms south of Le Mans off the N23 in Northern France.
The Parc covers 6 hectares and claims to have 150 species. How long the
Parc has been opened was not displayed, but it appears to be expanding
from a rather small base. Certainly there could be more aviaries and they
could be arranged more tastefully.
Various forms of ornamental and domesticated fowl roamed around.
There was a single Emu, pairs of Rheas and Crowned Cranes, plus 3
Demoiselle Cranes. Various Ducks and Geese were present, plus pairs of
Mute and Black Swans, the cock of which appeared to be very aggressive.
Generally the ponds needed to have clearer water.
Parrots were well in evidence. Lories included Red-collared, Blue-
streaked, Chattering and Green-naped. There was Stanley, Mealy and
Golden-mantled Rosellas. Pairs of Orange-winged Amazons, Lesser
Sulphur-crested Cockatoos and Peach-faced Lovebirds were seen. No
Macaws were to be seen and the same applies to Owls. Some of the Parc is
a wood and this could be ideal for Owls.
Amongst the Softbills seen were Emerald, Spreo and Purple Glossy
Starlings. Livingstone's and Violaceous Touracos, Indian Hill and
Indonesian Mynahs. There were Bank and Pagoda Mynahs, plus a Rosy
Pastor. Four Red-billed Blue Magpies had an aviary to themselves but it
would be better if it was larger. Pairs of Black-throated and White-throated
Laughing Thrushes were seen. I was pleasantly surprised to see a single
Laminated Hill Toucan in an outside flight with a heated shelter with the
heat on. The aviary was in the wooded section so in the autumn/winter
period it obviously copes well with the weather.
There was two large walk through flights based on the Nissen hut design.
One of these aviaries had various small seedeaters, Doves including Green-
winged and a beautiful Red-collared Whydah, plus some of the
aforementioned softbills. Each of these aviaries had a small shed where
the birds could be fed or go inside in bad weather. There was hardly any
nesting sites and both aviaries could have done with better vegetation and
planting. The aviaries looked bare.
Looking at the birds being fed there was spiked fruit but the chopped
fruit looked too big to me. No livefood was seen at all. Pellets were much
in evidence but I didn't see any softbill food. The nectar given to the
Lories had chopped fruit floating on top.
A new very high aviary was under construction, perhaps for Ibis, Egrets
or Storks. Certainly the gardens could be improved with a little thought
and planting of some new shrubs and trees. For the public more aviaries
containing a greater selection would enhance the Parc and provide better
value.

to be rather poor in 1995. Most of the Parrotlike aviaries had a shelter
where the birds are fed and where their nest box is always in view of the
public. Several birds needed mates which in most cases ought not to be
difficult if this was Britain. Perhaps in France it is not so easy.
The Parc is open every day from 9.30 until dusk. Cost of admission
was 30 francs (about #4). There was a small cafeteria and benches to sit
on. We were there from 9.30 for almost 2 hours and were the only visitors.
If you are in the area a visit ought to be considered to see what progress is
being made.

will. This money has been put into the Society's general account. Your
council, and in particular Mike Curzon who had worked with Donald Risdon
for over 30 years, wanted to do something to ensure that his memory would
not be forgotten. Donald was at his death a vice-president and had been a
member for 59 years. He was a great supporter of the Society in many ways
including contributions to the Avicultural Magazine.
It was decided that an annual award be given for the best article to
appear in Avicultural Magazine. Members at the end of each year will be
asked to contact the secretary to advise their choice. The council will then
consider and adjudicate. The first year is to be 1995 and therefore members
are asked to send in their choice. Length of article is not important as a
single page can contain a wealth of new information. The seven talks
given at the Centenary Celebrations are all eligible as individual articles.
Overseas articles are, of course, included.
The award for 1995 is a painting by council member, Malcolm Ellis.
Please show your appreciation for all the Donald did for the Society by
taking part. It is also hoped that this annual award will encourage more
contribution, to your world famous magazine.

Amazona rhodocorytha AT PALMITOS PARK
by Rosemary Low
The three Amazon parrots endemic to south-east Brazil are currently
considered to be endangered, as are the endemic conures and the two
endemic Touit parrotlets. Of the three Amazons, only the Vinaceous
Amazona vinacea is regularly bred in captivity. The other two, the Red-
topped or Red-browed A. rhodocorytha and the Red-tailed A. brasiliensis
have never been well represented in collections outside Brazil.
A. rhodocorytha has several common names, therefore I prefer to use
the scientific name, to avoid confusion. Whichever name one chooses,
there is no denying that this is a very beautiful bird. The head coloration is
variable; the shade on the forehead and crown is a soft orange in some; the
feathers of the pileum (top of the head) are plum-coloured and green in
most birds. The feathers of the nape and mantle are margined with plum
or grey. The cheeks and throat are also variable - usually they are a soft
and pleasing shade of blue, but are green washed with the same shade of
blue in some birds. The lores are yellow. Generally this yellow extends
downwards on to the throat in females, whereas in males it is restricted to
the lores.
There are three other features which add to the beauty of this Amazon.
One is the pink tinged upper mandible. Then there are the eyes, which are
large and appealing, and lack the aggression of so many Amazons. Finally,
there is the tail, which is beautifully marked with red. This species is
about 36cm (14in) in length and weighs in the region of 430-460g. One of
our females weighed only 375g and the largest male weighed 465g.
On the subject of weight, it is important to note that this Amazon in
particular, easily becomes overweight. The quantity of fattening foods,
such as sunflower seed, must be restricted. A diet which is high in fresh
fruits and vegetables is recommended. All fruits are relished with orange
the favourite. Carrot is also greatly enjoyed.
This Amazon is found in one of the regions most ravaged by deforestation
- with more endangered endemic species than almost any other area of the

world. The forests of the south-east coast of Brazil have been replaced
largely by sprawling cities such as Rio de Janeiro. A. rhodocorytha is
already extinct in that state and occurs now only to the north in Espirito
Santo and Bahia. With a population estimated at only 2,500 it is one of the
most endangered parrots of continental South America.

A. rhodocorytha is one of the most beautiful of the Amazons
There is a local demand for this species as pets and as recently as a
decade ago they were even sold as food. It is rare in captivity outside
Brazil. Strangely enough, perhaps the only country in which it has been
bred consistently, albeit in small numbers, is in the UK. Pairs were made
up from a very small number of birds imported at different times, perhaps
mostly single birds which came in on ships. I know of several such birds
which were bought in pet shops from people who had no idea what they
were.
A studbook has been established for this species - an important step in
securing the survival of this Amazon in aviculture, as breeders are few and
birds are widely scattered. I strongly urge all fortunate enough to keep this
Amazon to contact the studbook holder, Roger Sweeney, at Loro Parque,
Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife.

Palmitos Park is a member of this studbook and in the year of the
studbook's formation, the first rhodocorytha chick hatched. The larger
Amazons, with the exception of the Double Yellow-head A. ochrocephala
oratrix , are not easy to breed. The Mealy A. farinosa is seldom bred - and
the Mealy and rhodocorytha are very much alike in temperament.
Compatibility is extremely important. Only two of our five pairs attempted
to breed. Hopefully this situation will be corrected, as all the pairs are due
to be introduced into a new complex which features an enormous aviary in
the centre. There they will be able to fly for some months each year and
choose their own partners.
The two pairs which attempted to breed are undoubtedly the most
compatible. One female laid two clutches last year, the first of two and the
second of three eggs, all of which were, sadly, infertile. They measured
40.2mm x 31.8mm and 42.7mm x 32.8mm (first clutch), and 41.8mm x
29.5mm, 43.9mm x 31.0mm and 42.5mm x 32.0mm (second clutch). The
male and female used to be housed in adjoining cages with different partners.
In September 1992 each spent three weeks trying to preen the other's head
through the wire, so the following month they were put together. No eggs
were laid until last year when the female laid her first clutch at the end of
April.
The other pair is one of the most compatible pairs of Amazons I have
ever observed. They are not housed with the other Amazons. The front of
their suspended cage was by my kitchen window and the back of it
overlooked my bathroom window. They are inquisitive and liked to see
what was happening in my kitchen. My Yellow-fronted Amazon A.
ochrocephala sat on her stand by the kitchen door and watched them daily
and often joined in with their chortling calls. They provided me with a
tremendous amount of pleasure, with their cheery vocalisations and constant
displays of affection towards each other. The male's frequent imitations of
a hen about to lay, suggest that he was reared where there were chickens
running about.
The extreme affection which the male and female demonstrate towards
each other is so unlike that of many Amazon pairs. They spend hours
mutual preening and often preen each others' heads simultaneously. They
can also be seen vent-preening - an activity which is not common in
Amazons (unlike cockatoos, for example). They often play together, hanging
from the roof of their cage. They swing by one leg and with the free foot
grasp the foot of their partner. This affectionate behaviour is seen throughout
the year. Before the breeding season, for several weeks there are prolonged
sessions of copulation which can occur at any time of the day. Less tame
pairs of Amazons usually mate in the early morning and probably also in
the late afternoon, when there is little disturbance.

In 1992 the female's eggs were infertile. In mid-February 19931 watched
the female crouching to invite copulation, but it was two weeks before the
male was seen to respond. His initial attempts were unsuccessful, as he
obviously lacked experience. However, by 6th April the female was
incubating two eggs, both of which proved to be fertile. The chick in the
first egg died not long before it was due to hatch. On 29th April I found
that the other egg had been opened by the parents. At first I thought this
was due to inexperience, as this is not uncommon with Amazons. However,
it was soon obvious that the chick could not hatch unaided. The inside of
the egg was very dry. I placed it in a hatcher with high humidity and the
chick hatched the following day. As soon as I saw it, I knew it would not
survive. It looked unhealthy and dehydrated, and lived only three days. A
bacterial infection was suspected.
In 1995 the first egg was laid 22nd April. It was enormous - probably
the largest Amazon egg I have ever seen. I inspected the nest daily for the
next five days or so because the female left the nest quite frequently. It
seemed that one huge egg was to replace two normal ones! When she
started to incubate in earnest she became aggressive and nest inspection
was impossible for some while. When I could look, I was surprised to see
a second egg. The first hatched on or about 20th May. When the female
left the nest on 22nd May I suspected that something had gone wrong.
Sadly, inspection revealed a dead chick with the upper mandible removed.
I suspected that the female had killed it due to inexperience but the injury
could have occurred after the chick died. It was impossible to tell.
I was very disappointed but determined the same fate should not befall
the next chick. I took the other egg, which was pipping, and immediately
placed it in a hatcher. Also in the hatcher was a Pesquet's Parrot Psittrichas
fulgidus egg. On the evening of the next day both chicks were calling
loudly. Next morning, 24th May, I was greeted by the sight of two beautiful
chicks both of which weighed 18g. There the resemblance ended. The
rhodocorytha had yellow down on the back and nape only; the Pesquet's
was covered with white down.
I hand-reared the Pesquet's but the rhodocorytha was put straight out.
I was fortunate in that one of our most reliable pairs of Amazons had hatched
her first chick two days previously. This was a pair of Finsch's A. finschi
which, in the past, I regularly used to feed Hawk-head Deroptyus
accipitrinus chicks along with their own (until the age of three weeks) and
to foster other Amazon species (even to independence).
That day or early the next, the second Finsch's chick hatched; the third
hatched on 28th May. They were then feeding four chicks. It was to their
great credit that every chick was equally well fed. The rhodocorytha was
so large I feared the smallest finschi chick might have to be removed but
this was not necessary.

I weighed the chicks when I could but after a few days the male clearly
showed his disapproval of this by rushing aggressively to the nest entrance.
I was therefore apprehensive about weighing them very often and gave up
my hope of regularly weighing the rhodocorytha. By the time the chicks
were four weeks old they filled the interior of the nest-box and the female
entered only to feed them. In spite of the fact that nest inspection was
carried out from the service passage where the birds could not see me, they
always knew as soon as I opened the nest inspection door. On most days I
had little more than a glimpse of the chicks before the male came to voice
his disapproval.

There is a real danger of displaced aggression as such times, i.e. the
parent cannot attack the source of the danger, so he attacks the nearest
chick instead. The information I recorded on the development of the
rhodocorytha was therefore sparse.

Partly due to a lack of handling and perhaps also due to a natural
wildness, the rhodocorytha was too difficult to handle after this age.
By eight days old its feet had become grey, at 10 days the lower mandible
was grey at the base and at 13 days the chick was ringed with an 11mm
ring. The chick seemed large for its age and very solid. At 15 days the
lower mandible was darker at the base and the eyes were slitting.
At 21 days the ears and eyes were wide open. At 25 days the chick was
large and sturdy and weighed 44 lg - and had already exceeded the adult
weight. The feet were large and very strong. Most of the wing feathers,
except the primaries, had erupted, also the thigh feathers. The head was
still bare, with feathers just about to break through the skin. At 28 days
there was a blush on the forehead where the red feathers were growing
beneath the skin. The tail feathers were through the sheaths, and were
about 5mm long.
The young Amazon feathered up very quickly; less than two weeks
later it was fully feathered but had a shorter tail. By then the beak had the
pinkish tinge of a adult. It left the nest on 18th July at the age of 55 days.
I was surprised to see it perched confidently on the food tray at the front of
the aviary with its foster parents. The three Finsch's Amazons left the nest
on 14th, 19th and 21st July.
All four young ones could sometimes be seen in a line on the perch at
the back of the aviary. They were all in perfect feather and quite beautiful.
Throughout the rearing period, they has not given me a moment's concern.
Every year this perfect pair of birds rears its young thus - plus any foster
chicks added to their nest. Their only small fault - and this occurs solely
out of concern for the safety of their young - is their behaviour when someone
passes the aviary after the young have fledged. Because they are not tame,
a person is seen as a threat to their young. Therefore, not being able to
attack the person, they lunge at the nearest youngster. However, no harm
has ever occurred.

The rearing food consists of the normal mixture of seeds, fruits,
vegetables, cooked maize and beans. Fresh corn is given when available
(on average, every other day during the rearing period) and each day they
get a homemade rearing food consisting of carrot, hard-boiled egg and
wholegrain bread, They eat everything offered.
It was a long wait to rear our first rhodocorytha - making it all the more
satisfying. Others with this species have also had to exercise patience.
However, I believe that events in the decade to come will see this species
more firmly established in aviculture. In view of its precarious status in
the wild, it is extremely important that this should be so.
The above article was written while Rosemary Low was Curator of the
breeding centre at Palmitos Park. The park has since been sold and the
breeding centre is no longer in operation as such. However, the pair of A.
rhodocorytha are still there and had two chicks in the nest in June 1996.
Rosemary Low has returned to the UK to live and is concentrating on
writing and looking after her collection of lories.

INVERMECTIN IN THE TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY
MITES
by Deirdre Gibson

<bodyText confidence="0.999515054054054" page_id="56260995"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
A pair of East African Superb or Spreo Starlings Spreo superbus , in
apparently good condition, were obtained during mild weather at the
beginning of November and put straight outside. Two weeks later night
temperatures fell sharply and they were seen to sneeze occasionally. They
were brought inside, where the male rapidly got worse.
Dry sneezing in the absence of mucous and other respiratory or ocular
implications is a classic symptom of lung mites. This may go on to include
a loud whistling wheeze or a dry cough. The connection between the onset
of cold weather and the appearance or recurrence of symptoms was obvious.
This had also happened with a Gouldian Finch Chloebia gouldiae which
was kept outside in an unheated greenhouse, built against the house window.
It too had appeared healthy, but after a few cold nights, the bird's respiratory
whistling could be heard indoors. This finch successfully responded to
dichlorvos (Gibson, 1978).
The pair of Spreos were placed beneath an 18.6% dichlorvos pest strip
for two periods of a week, with a week in between. This made no difference
whatsoever. A tracheal swab from the male confirmed that it did indeed
have mites which were not speciated. The female continued to sneeze only
very occasionally.
Some ivermectin was obtained but no specific information was available
for its use in the treatment of birds - only the dose for cattle (amounting to
0.2mg/kg) was given in the package insert. All doses in this article are
given in the customary mg/kg and refer to the actual amount of ivermectin,
not the liquid being administered. It should be noted that in some articles
doses are given in micrograms, which may be misread and cause confusion.
The male Spreo, weighing 70g, was given various doses, from 0.14 up
to 1.07mg/kg, with no effect. Then six doses of 1.8mg/kg were administered
over 33 days, also with no effect. Because handling the birds brought on
increased and quite severe respiratory distress, all the above doses were
injected into mealworms, which were then fed to the birds. The innards of
mealworms are under high pressure and injecting them successfully takes
a little practise. I inject the larvae slowly over several seconds, then withdraw
the needle very slowly and wait to make sure none of the dose comes back
out. Alternatively, the tail can be nicked off the mealworm, which
depressurises it, but it also shrinks, leaving less room for the dose.
It is easier to dose birds directly, but if this method is used, it is important
to get well past the epiglottis. It is also important to avoid touching the

tongue, for like a lot of medicines, ivermectin tastes foul. For this reason,
birds will not eat mealworms which have leaked and may remain suspicious
of them for up to 12 hours or more.
Things had reached to serious stage with the Spreos. The male was
sneezing between two and five times in succession about every three minutes.
The 69.5g female was not so bad, though her rate of sneezing had also
increased. Belatedly, some House Sparrows Passer domesticus and
European Starlings Sturnus vulgaris were caught for dosing experiments -
something which should have been done at the beginning. All of these
were dosed directly down the throat, using a lee syringe. The two European
Starlings were each given 21.5rng/kg. This did not slow them down in the
least and they took off at high speed two days later.
The House Sparrows, all males weighing between 26 and 28g, were
given doses ranging from 13.17-76.92mg/kg - the latter being 385 times
greater than the dose recommended for cattle! One female was left untreated
to monitor feeding, etc. The bird given the lowest dose was visibly
unaffected, but scarcely ate. Twenty-four hours later, it was given a further
15.25mg/kg (total 28.42mg/kg) and within three hours looked very ill. It
sat fluffed-up on the perch or on the floor, usually with its eyes shut and
shivered occasionally. Ivermectin does not clear the system within a day,
the half-life being 22-28 hours in humans (though no doubt less in birds),
so the symptoms were due to the accumulation of about 20-22mg/kg. This
sparrow hardly ate at all during the two days of dosing but on the third day
recovered completely - eating well and flying against the bars. Along with
the female, it was kept for a month then released, still in good condition.
The others given single doses ranging from 38.5-76.92mg/kg, all showed
the above symptoms, except that one did not fluff-up. None appeared to be
any better or worse than the others, in spite of the wide dose range. Like
the first bird, they were all fine one day after treatment and took off rapidly
when released three days later. The Spreos were then treated with more
confidence. After the earlier months of futile treatment with increased
doses up to 1.8mg/kg, the male's symptoms disappeared the day after a
single administration of 5mg/kg. The female, which had become much
worse by that time, did not respond, and needed 7.2mg/kg, after which her
symptoms disappeared overnight. It was then the end of March and the
pair went on to have three nests of chicks in the summer. At the end of the
year they were still free of symptoms.
Other birds on the premises (which came originally from China, via
California) included a 17g Siberian Blue Robin Erithacus cyane with a
slight infection, judging from its sporadic and light sneezing. This bird
was eventually, in March, given 14.7mg/kg. Like the male Spreo, it did
not respond to many lower doses given over a four month period. Although

the symptoms abated, it recommenced sneezing lightly and infrequently at
a friend's place about three weeks later (the exact time was not recorded).
A female Scarlet Minivct Pericrocotus flammeus, with several problems,
was neither affected nor cured by 11.7mg/kg. Its sneezing finally abated
when it was given 15.6mg/kg, though, it became ill for a day, just like the
sparrows, and sat with its eyes shut and threw-up its last meal. This bird
died from other causes soon afterwards.
In the meantime, a letter from the manufacturer, Merck, confirmed that
no 'official' information was available on the use of the product for birds
and because of this would make no recommendations for Ivomec (its trade
name for ivermectin) in this regard. In spite of this, ivermectin is used in
veterinary surgeries around the country to treat respiratory mites, often by
the 'spot' method. The absorption of this chemical is about the same,
whether given by intramuscular, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection,
oral dosing or even by skin spot treatment. So in cases where it is not of
dire necessity, injecting birds is too traumatic and quite reprehensible
treatment. Merck supplied information from a book by Cambell which
quoted some papers on mites - an interesting one being that of Grimm and
Centurier, 1986, who found that the airsac mite ( Cytodites nudus ) was
only knocked-out in pheasants by a dose of 50mg/kg.
Some reasonable conclusions can be drawn from this very small trial,
the most worrying one being that there is a very resistant (to both ivermectin
and dichlorvos) strain of respiratory mites. It is puzzling that birds from
divergent sources should have such resistant mites, but these could have
been picked-up in a government quarantine station or a dealer's premises.
Apparent cures cannot be assumed by the immediate cessation of
symptoms. The mites can be suppressed by subclinical doses of medication
and symptoms ameliorated temporarily, so a follow-up of at least one month
is prudent. The breeding success of birds is not affected by 7.2mg/kg of
ivermectin and probably not by any sublethal dose (neither was breeding
affected by dichlorvos). The point at which small birds weighing 16-33g
become visibly affected by ivermectin is plus or minus 15mg/kg. Although
higher doses make the bird ill, recovery is complete within one or two
days. Ivermectin has a very wide safety margin for birds. Even a massive
dose - 385 times the cattle dose - is not lethal.

BREEDING AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE NORTHERN
CARDINAL
</sectionHeader>

Cardinalis cardinalis (formerly Richmondena cardinalis) is probably
the most popular and well-known of the New World passerine species. In
most general ornithological literature, Cardinal, was formerly used as a
substantive name for it. Other names include Common Cardinal, Virginian
Cardinal, Red Cardinal and Scarlet Cardinal. In the USA it is also known
locally as the Redbird and Cardinal Redbird.
The New World Emberizidae has been the subject of much taxonomic
revision and debate. C. cardinalis is often included in the Cardinal-Grosbeak
group in the subfamily Cardinalinae (formerly Pyrrhuloxiinae and
Richmondeninae). Gruson (1976), Howard &amp; Moore (1980), and Walters
(1980), gave the group separate subfamily status within the family
Emberizidae and Clements (1981) also listed them with the Emberizidae.
De Schauensee (1970) included the genus Cardinalis with some 53 genera
in the family Fringillidae .
The first breeding in the UK was probably in 1834. Since then it has
been bred quite a number of times, although it would appear that few
breeding reports have been published in the UK. One of the most detailed
accounts is that of Gjessing (1956), who bred them in Norway. My account
describes some aspects of the breeding and behaviour of captive C. cardinalis
between 1971 and 1977 in southern England.
This species is approximately 15-24mm (6-9.5in) long and sexually
dimorphic. The bill is large and the male's is red in colour. The head crest
is well developed and the entire plumage is red, except for a black patch at
the base of the bill. The female's bill is a paler shade of red than the
male's. Her plumage is light brown or yellowish brown, paler below. There
is a faint flush of red on the head, wings and tail, and sometimes on the
under-tail coverts. There is geographical variation in colour and size, with
some 18 races recognised, depending on which taxonomic list is consulted.
Distribution, introduced distribution and habitat
Canada, central and eastern USA, Mexico, south to Guatemala. The
Northern Cardinal has since the turn of the century extended its breeding
range northwards into Canada. It first nested there in 1901 at Point Pelee,
Ontario. The species breeds now in Ontario and southern Manitoba. It

has also been recorded in Quebec, southern Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia.
In the USA a mixture of races have been introduced into south-western
California. They inhabit woods, parks, gardens, cultivated areas, swamps,
cane breaks and semi-desert regions. Other successful introductions have
taken place in Bermuda and the Hawaiian islands. In Bermuda it was once
common, but in rural areas numbers have declined due to urbanisation and
loss of cedar forest. It is established on all the larger Hawaiian islands. It
is regarded as a nuisance because of the damage it causes to fruit (Long,
1981).
Breeding
Aviary birds in the UK usually start nesting in April or May. A breeding
pair I had, built their nest and laid in late May for five consecutive seasons.
Captive birds will rear three broods. In the wild three or four broods are
reared sometimes. The cup-shaped nest is made of thin twigs, weed stems,
grasses, bark fibres, vines and rootlets, and sometimes paper and rags, etc.,
and lined with rootlets, fine grasses and hair. The site is variable, though
usually in a shrub or vine tangle. The nests built by my birds were deep
cups, consisting of a few twigs, dried grasses and stems, lined with finer
grasses and once, a small amount of dried moss. The site was always in a
clump of cut gorse hung up in the aviary. On many occasions the same
nest was relined and used again for the next brood.
The female plays the main role in the building but I have often seen the
male carrying material to the nest site. The ground colour of the eggs is
white or slightly greenish and they are speckled and spotted, and have
small blotches of medium to dark brown, rarely reddish brown and paler
purple or grey. The many clutches laid by one female in my aviaries were
consistently a very pale bluish colour, sparsely spotted with brown and
ashy brown concentrated at the larger end. The clutch size is 3-4, rarely 2
or 5.
Incubation is carried out by the female but the male has been seen
covering the eggs for brief periods, when the female is off the nest, feeding
or bathing. The incubation period is 12-13 days. The nestlings have orange
skin and blackish-grey down. The gape is red and the gape flanges cream
coloured.
The female broods the chicks very closely for the first five to six days.
The young are fed by both parents. The chicks leave the nest as early as ten
days old, at which stage they have little or no tail growth but have short
crests. The chicks can reach the top perches in an aviary, but their flight is

limited and perching uncoordinated. The female will lay the next clutch
within eight to ten days, sometimes less, after which the male will undertake
most of the feeding of the first brood. The female has been seen to feed
them when she leaves the nest and the young will roost close to the nest
while she is incubating. On several occasions I have seen the chicks sitting
and standing on the female's back while she is sitting. The male and
female will feed the first brood at the nest during the incubation of the
second clutch. The young can feed themselves about 14-16 days after leaving
the nest. They can be left in the aviary until the second brood has hatched,
after which the male will sometimes begin to harass them (Trollope, 1992).
The young are fed almost exclusively on livefood for at least the first
eight to ten days. I gave them a mixture of mealworms and pupae, cleaned
small maggots, house crickets and stick insects of various sizes, as well as
the usual seed mixtures, soaked seed and greenfood. The 'commercial'
livefood was supplemented with livefood that I collected to give them the
variety which is so essential. The adults will sometimes feed the young on
a softfood mixture and they are very fond of tomatoes, apples, peas and leaf
buds.
In six of the seven breeding seasons recorded, reproduction progressed
without incident, until the young were independent of their parents. At
this stage, at least one young bird died. A curious feature of these mortalities,
was that the survivors always proved to be males. By contrast, the young
died when fledged during the seventh year. It was a very poor year for
collecting 'wild' invertebrates, which because of the greater variety would
have been superior to the limited commercial livefood available at the time.
Behaviour
Nesting and copulation are preceded by courtship feeding, when the
male approaches the female with an insect or other choice morsel, which
she often solicits with a begging posture with shivering wings. Sometimes
the pair will just touch bills before courtship feeding, and the female having
accepted the offering, will feed it back to the male. The nuptial display
consists of the male chasing the female while singing loudly. When she
perches, he approaches her with his crest erect, and the head and neck are
swung from side to side (during which the male continues to sing), and the
head is sometimes lowered then raised. The male will also elongate his
body and slip sideways along the branch towards the female. This posture
and movement is often followed by copulation, sometimes after courtship
feeding.

These cardinals are avid sunbathers and rain-bathers. During heavy
rain I have seen them perched near the top of a heavily-leafed shrub, singing
loudly, preening themselves and rubbing their plumage on the wet leaves.
When I put ant pupae in the aviary, they would &apos;ant' for some time, rubbing
the adult insect through their plumage and often ate the ants as well as the
pupae.

BREEDING THE LAUGHING KOOKABURRA

The Laughing Kookaburra Dacelo novaeguineae which measures about
42cm (16Viin) long is the largest member of the Kingfisher family coming
from Australia and must be one of the best-known Australian birds. It has
a stout body, an enormous head and a relatively short but powerful bill.
When it raises its crown feathers the head appears even bigger. The upper
mandible is dark and the lower mandible is horn-coloured. Youngsters
have a uniformly dark coloured bill. The head is creamy white with a
brown stripe along the top. The back, wings and tail are mainly various
shades of brown and grey. The lesser wing-coverts are marked with light
blue. There is also some blue on the lower rump, which is more noticeable
on my male. The underparts are buffy cream. Those of my male are darker
than those of the female.
This species has been kept in captivity for over 100 years. London Zoo
is credited with the first breeding in the UK in 1905. Until Australia
introduced an export ban in 1960, it appears to have been exported quite
frequently. By the end of the 1970s it was kept in only a few collections.
Most were in zoos. However, during the 1980s several of these collections
started to breed Kookaburras. The price fell from #1,200 (approx. US$ 1,800)
to about #300 (approx. US$450) for a pair of surgically sexed youngsters.
Surgical sexing has played a considerable part in this success, as it has
with many other species of birds. I had always wanted a pair but the price
put them out of my range. In 1988, The Tropical Bird Gardens at Rode
reared a single chick which was sexed and found to be a female. It is tame,
but has the habit of jumping on peoples' backs when they least expect it to.
More were bred later and towards the end of 1992, my friend Mike Curzon,
a director of Rode, asked if I was interested in two females? I said, I was,
but needed time to provide suitable accommodation, as they cannot be kept
with smaller inmates. My father had for many years kept a small stud of
light yellow budgerigars, but had difficulty acquiring fresh blood and decided
to part with the remaining birds. His birdroom flights were dismantled
and an aviary was built which measures 2.10m x 4m x 2.1m high (6ft lOin
x 13ft x 6ft 6Vi\n high). Attached to it is a shelter 2.1m x 80cm (6ft lOin x
2ft IVim) built from concrete blocks, for roosting and where the birds are
fed. The shelter has a corrugated plastic roof, partly covered because there
is a street light above it. The aviary floor is half sand and half 16mm
(approx. Vim) limestone chippings, which make it easy to maintain. There
is a 75cm (29Vim) circular dish for bathing.
The birds were put into their new accommodation on Saturday 29th
May 1993 and settled in immediately. They were offered chopped day-old

chicks sprinkled with SA37 vitamin supplement occasionally. A mouse is
given to them from time to time and they have had a frog which they found
difficult to digest. They eagerly consume mealworms. At first softbill food
was sprinkled on the chicks, but was soon discontinued as they appeared to
remove it. At times a few sliced grapes are given by hand and are eaten.
In 1993, a male was bred at Rode and Mike Curzon asked to swap it for
one of my females. This took place Saturday 17th November. I kept the
female which was bred at Rode in 1988 and when the young male was put
in with her, they took to each other immediately.
Their name is well deserved. They have a long, loud call and when one
begins the other generally joins in. They throw back their heads and stand
almost vertically on their perches. Their calling arouses the interest of
people walking past outside. One couple were reported to have told their
friends that they had heard Kookaburras calling and thought they were on
holiday in Australia! In the summer they call early in the morning and
unless one has sympathetic neighbours, or none at all, they are not birds to
keep in a built-up area, where their owner could be inviting trouble.
My two can instantly be distinguished from each other, as the male is
smaller and has a darker head and a duller coloured breast than the female,
which has a ring on one leg. The male is not as tame as the female, he will
accept food from the hand but cannot be stroked. The female enjoys this at
times, but can give a sharp bite. She dislikes my hat and on various occasions
has flown at my head with the intention of attacking it. When the hat is
offered to her, she will refuse to part with it for several minutes, until
finally it becomes too heavy for her. John Meeke, who used to work at
Rode, said that at times Kookaburras will fly straight at a person's head for
no apparent reason. I have not found this to be the case with my birds. The
male will at times crash about. In 1995, he developed the habit of flying at
the wire netting and attacking the wooden fence panel behind it, always at
the same point, where there is now a small hole. Even the female has been
seen doing this.
Both enjoy the sun and will stretch out one wing at a time when
sunbathing. This is usually done on a perch, but occasionally on the floor.
When bathing they get really wet and at times have difficulty flying back
up onto the perches. They will sit out in the rain with similar results
sometimes. At first I was concerned but soon came to accept this as a
regular occurrence. In the winter I keep an eye on them, as they will
sometimes take a bath after the ice has been broken and fresh water put
into the dish.
Their shelter is not heated and therefore is not frost-proof. Most
Kookaburras do not have access to a heated shelter and this does not seem
to create any problems, such as frost-bitten toes. Their food freezes
sometimes, but fresh food is put in about 7am each day.

There are two plant boxes in which I hoped to grow some foliage to
help screen the wooden panel at the back of the aviary. Only partial success
can be reported, as at times they pull out some of the grass. A honeysuckle
has at present remained in place for about four months. Mint has grown
on the floor in one place, as they seem to dislike the taste of it. A clematis
proved great fun and was pulled about until all that remained was a root,
and this too was pulled out.
When planes go over both birds sit very still looking up at them. Hot
air balloons caused panic at first, but this may have been more to do with
the fact that as the gas is released there is a loud hissing noise, especially
when the balloon is low down.
Rode loaned me a nest-box and a replica was made of plywood. It is
30.5cm square x 38cm deep (12in square x 15in deep), with an entrance
chamber 15cm x 10cm x 91.5cm deep (6in x 4in x 3ft deep). It has a 4cm
(Wiin) landing area. An upturned turf was put inside the box, which was
screwed onto a pair of brackets fitted to the side of the shelter. The box is
1m (39in) above the ground and faces west. Upon the box being installed
both birds inspected it and over the next two weeks most of the earth was
removed, after which the female soon started to spend a lot of time inside.
Mating was not observed by me, but was observed by my father. I have
subsequently witnessed mating and on two occasions saw the male hold
the female's head in his bill. It was hoped that eggs would be laid and sure
enough, 10th May 1994, the first egg was seen, followed by a second early
in the evening on the 12th May and a third two days later. The female
became very protective and when anyone entered the aviary would fly
around, and on one occasion, landed on my father's head and attacked his
hat, just as she had done to me on various occasions. The eggs, which were
white, were not checked to find if they were fertile and were not measured.
As the male was under 12 months old, there was some doubt as to whether
they would be fertile.
Incubation was undertaken by both birds, with the female doing the
major portion. The 6th June an egg shell was seen on the aviary floor
beneath the nest-box. The 9th June more egg shell was removed. I had
been told that when there were young, I needed to cut the day-old chicks
into very small pieces to make it easier for the young to digest them. The
food, which was dusted with SA37, appeared satisfactory and consumption
increased. When the parents were off the nest, from outside the aviary we
could see two chicks and noticed how ugly they looked. Their growth
appeared to be satisfactory. When both parents were in the box with the
young, it must have been very crowded. On the evening of the 26th June,
I was amazed to see there was a third youngster. The young male had done
his job well. Generally the female roosted with the young in the box.

On the 9th July the first youngster left the nest, followed at two-day
intervals by the others. The weather was dry and the water dish was soon
partly emptied. The young had a tendency to thrash around but no damage
appeared to be done. They were independent by the 31st July, 21 days after
the first youngster had left the nest. The youngsters were, as expected,
smaller versions of their parents, except that the buffy cream was very dirty
looking and their bills were all brown. The young were taken to Rode on
Saturday 13th August, as a buyer had been found for them. The adults
were then mine.
The female seemed very annoyed by the removal of the young. The box
was taken out to be cleaned and a week later was put back with a new
upturned turf, and although it was immediately investigated and some of
the earth was thrown out, nothing further happened in 1994.
The winter of 1994/95 was mild and events in 1995 unfolded as follows :-

Third egg seen.
One of the earlier youngsters was
removed and sent with one of Rode's
youngsters to Abbotsbury Swannery,
Dorset.
Egg shell seen on the ledge of the nest-box.
Two chicks seen.
Third chick seen.
The three chicks seem to be growing okay
- they are very near the entrance to the nest-
box. The food intake appears to be
satisfactory. It is the hottest day so far and
the parents are not brooding the chicks. My
father sprayed the nest-box. Wasps are a
particular pest, as they appear to be eating
the cut-up day-old chicks.
All appears to be going well. The young
bird from the first brood was seen carrying
food into the nest-box.
The three chicks appear to be growing
satisfactorily.
I saw all three chicks.
All appears to be going well. It has been a
very hot week.
The first wet day for over nine weeks.
The first youngster is out of the nest.
The second youngster is out of the nest.
The third youngster is out of the nest.
The birds are sold.
Summing up, I have had great pleasure from my Kookaburras. The
fact that the female of the pair was hand-reared has not presented any
problems over imprinting. To have bred eight youngsters has been the
icing on the cake for me. Their food may not be to everyone's taste, but
they are certainly interesting birds, perhaps more so in the case of my pair
because the female is reasonably tame.

BIRD WATCHING IN BRAZIL

<bodyText confidence="0.987534157894737" page_id="56261007"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
Brazil is the largest country in South America but it does not have the
greatest number of bird species. This honour is held by Colombia which
has the advantage of including the extra habitats of the Andes within its
boundaries. However, Brazil does have the dubious distinction of a longer
list of threatened species. This, in part, is the result of deforestation on the
eastern Atlantic seaboard, where remnant forests now hold so many of the
country's threatened species.
Among the birds of Brazil are many presently or previously held at
Chester Zoo, so it was with particular anticipation that I arrived at Rio de
Janeiro with four other birdwatchers in July 1992. We headed for Brazil's
only mountainous region which is situated some 150km north-west of Rio
and is now protected as the Parque Nacional do Itatiaia. There we spent
four days birding the tracks from the lower forests, through cloud forest
and above the tree-line into the thin air of the paramo. The forested areas
were the hardest to bird, and while the tracks gave good opportunities to
see the larger and more conspicuous species the smaller grovellers needed
to be encouraged to show themselves by playing tape-recordings of their
calls.
That was how such elusive birds as Large-headed Flatbills Ramphotrigon
ruficauda were persuaded to come out into the open in response to the
apparent intruder calling in their territory. Other species were first located
by ear and then searched for. Swallow-tailed Manakins Chiroxiphia caudata
only gave away their presence by their distinctive calls. These gorgeous
birds were surprisingly difficult to see in the shadows of the thick bush
vegetation.
More conspicuous were the many species of tanagers. These included
Diademed Stephanophorus diadematus, Black-goggled Trichothraupis
melanops, Golden-chevroned Thraupis ornata, Green-headed Tangara
seledon, Burnished Buff T. cayana. Brassy-breasted T. desmaresti and Gilt-
edged T. cyanoventris. Several Red-breasted Toucans Ramphastos dicolorus
and a pair of Saffron Toucanets Baillonius bailloni (both species considered
'near-threatened') were among the many avian highlights.
Birds restricted to this small montane area of Brazil include the Itatiaia
Spinetail Schizoeaca moreirae, a small brown bird found only in the short
moorland-like habitat above the tree-line. Birds of the cloud forests included
the handsome and local Black and Gold Cotinga Tijuca atm. The cotingas
are a beautiful and fascinating family which includes cocks of the rock,
bellbirds and umbrellabirds - some of the most spectacular species in the

world. David Snow's excellent book, The Cotingas, is not only a classic
and a joy to read but includes some stunning plates. One bird illustrated in
the work is the tiny, Goldcrest-like, Kinglet Calyptura Calyptura cristata ,
which is known only from a few museum specimens collected in the vicinity
of Rio de Janeiro and the nearby Serra dos Orgaos. The Kinglet Calyptura
has not been seen this century and is almost certainly extinct.
Leaving such an excellent area as Itatiaia was difficult - but made easier
by the knowledge that our next birdwatching was to be in that tremendous
wetland, the Pantanal which borders on Bolivia and is a five-hour flight
from Rio de Janeiro.
The Pantanal was outstanding. Within a few hours of arriving we saw
a group of four Greater Rheas Rhea americana, then a pair of Red-legged
Seriama Cariama cristata, before we stopped for the first of many Jabiru
Jabiru mycteria. A pair of these huge storks stood, unperturbed by our
camera clicking, beside a tiny roadside pool. The wealth of birds was
astonishing with 'Chester Zoo Specials' including a trio of Bare-faced
Curassows Crax fasciolata and two Sun-Bitterns Eurypyga helias. The
night was spent at Hotel Poussada Pixaim, where our room mates included
mole crickets and two frogs. Next day we set off down the 240km dirt
track known as the Transpantanal Highway. More than 50 Jabiru, 11
Maguari Storks Ciconia maguari and numerous Wood Storks Mycteria
americana , plus spoonbills and many kinds of ibis and herons were seen,
as was an astonishing total of 34 Southern Screamers Chauna torquata.
The Pantanal is seasonally flooded and our visit was made in the dry
season when waterbirds were concentrated in the remaining wet areas
alongside the elevated highway. Familiar birds included Blue-fronted
Amazons Amazona aestiva and Toco Toucans R. toco. More unusual birds
included the amazing Red-billed Scythebill Campylorhamphus
trochilirostris - a rather drab, brown bird with a very long, curving red bill
- and the shy Sungrebe Heliornis fulica. Five Chestnut-bellied Guans
Penelope ochrogaster (now included in the Birdlife International checklist
of threatened birds) appeared briefly, as did the more numerous Common
Piping Guans Ahurria pipile and Chaco Chachlacas Ortalis canicollis.
Halfway along the Transpantanal Highway we arrived at a small kiosk
set in a grove of palm trees. An old lady hobbled across from a derelict
cottage to open the 'shop' and we were offered either a warm beer or cold
coke. This was the area where we had been told the Hyacinth Macaw
Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus had occasionally been seen. The Hyacinth
Macaw was really the one bird I had to see whilst in Brazil. I searched the
ground beneath the palm trees and found palm nuts that had been opened
by a clean bite across their top. Surely this was the work of Hyacinth
Macaws...but the nuts looked old rather than fresh and the trail appeared
cold.

My companions were more concerned with getting to grips with the
challenges posed by the grovellers and skulkers, and thus we entered the
swamps, drawn on by the ventriloquial calls of an elusive Undulated
Tinamou Crypturellus undulatus. On returning to the drinks kiosk the old
lady told us she had heard Hyacinth Macaws calling while we were away
conducting our fruitless search for the tinamou. That was more than I
could take and I set off walking along the road, cutting into an area of tall
trees where I suspected the Hyacinth Macaws might be hiding. Excited
calls preceded the birds flying-off across the road in full view, much to the
delight of my companions.
From within the trees, I could see only trees. My disappointment was
not to last, for within a short time I had excellent views of two pairs of
Hyacinth Macaws - and a pocketful of the palm nuts they had been eating.
These were later identified by John Dransfield of the Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew, as fruits of the palm Attalea maripa. These fruits are incredibly hard
but the macaws are adept at biting them open to secure the small fatty
seeds inside.
I then relaxed, enjoying the rest of the day's birds which included Yellow-
naped Macaws Ara auricollis. Hundreds of caiman were seen in pools
beside the road and these were most concentrated in the deeper water crossed
by bridges. The last of the many rickety bridges over water channels along
the Transpantanal Highway was in total collapse. We had no choice but to
pay the extortionate price of 150,000 cruzeiros (nearly #20 or US$30) to
have ourselves and our vehicle rafted to the other side. It was a case of
either that or returning in the dark over 200km back along the dirt road.
There was only one hotel at Porto Jofre at this far end of the road and that
monopoly allowed them to charge a million cruzeiros for two rooms shared
between seven of us. Our room was also occupied by leeches, several frogs
and a scorpion.
The next day was also outstanding with early morning views of an
Undulated Tinamou glimpsed between clumps of dense undergrowth. Four
Bare-faced Curassows, five each of Sungrebes and Toco Toucans, and a
total of 13 Hyacinth Macaws were seen as well as concentrations of waterside
birds including 25 Maguari Storks, dozens of Jabiru and hundreds of Snail
Kites Rostrhamus sociabilis. Other common raptors included Roadside
Buteo magnirostris, Savannah Buteogallus meridionalis and Black-collared
Hawks Busarellus nigricollis. Two more days in the Pantanal added further
sightings of many of these birds, including more Hyacinth Macaws. New
birds included Great Homed Owls Bubo virginianus and White Woodpeckers
Melanerpes candidus.
On the return journey we again stayed at the Hotel Poussada Pixaim
and allowed ourselves a little time to photograph the rather tame Yellow-
billed Cardinals Paroaria capitata and Silver-beaked Tanagers

Ramphocelus carho feeding on discarded food. A pair of Jabiru Storks
nesting close to the hotel were unusual in that the female had a completely
red head, totally lacking the black coloration shown by all of the hundreds
of other Jabiru we had seen.
After a late night celebrating our birding successes on the Pantanal we
forced ourselves out of our beds before 4am in order to get a good start for
the journey to Chapada. The open back of the jeep was wet and cold as we
drove through the rain up country to Chapada. It was still raining when
we arrived to find hundreds of cars full of sleeping occupants after the
previous night's annual carnival. Others still walked around the streets
with bottles, some still singing wrapped in blankets.
We found a hotel out of town and breakfasted before beginning to search
for birds. Soon we had forgotten the rain as through the mist we began to
find some excellent birds including flocks of Blue-headed Parrots Pionus
menstruus, Peach-fronted Aratinga aurea and White-eyed Conures A.
leucophthalmus, a Blue-crowned Motmot Momotus momota and the
exquisite Dot-eared Coquette Lophornis gouldii, a tiny hummingbird with
remarkable facial frills. Birds were watched catching the insects disturbed
by an army ant trail and these included a female White-backed Fire-eye
Pyriglena leuconota, Large-billed Antwren Herpsilochmus longirostris and
both Saffron-billed A rremonflavirostris and Pectoral SparrowsA. taciturnus.
Aviculturists would perhaps have been more taken by the brightly-coloured
Swallow Tanagers Tersina viridis and Purple-throated Euphonias Euphonia
chlorotica, but like ourselves might have had difficulty deciding whether
the toucans we saw were Yellow-ridged/?, vitellinus culminatus or Cuvier's
R. tucanus. Both look identical but the former croaks while the latter
yelps. These just remained silent!
That night we returned to Cuiaba, then the next day flew over burning
forest to Alto Floresta. There, on the southern edge of the Amazon, we
enjoyed our first views of Chestnut-fronted Macaws A. severa and saw our
only Hawk-headed Parrots D empty us accipitrinus fuscifrons of the trip.
These, unlike the Hawk-heads at Chester Zoo, were of the Brazilian race,
distinguished by their browner foreheads. Because of the ban on the export
of Brazilian birds, these are rarer in aviculture than the nominate form.
Also here were other really exciting rainforest birds including Spangled
Cotingas Cotinga cay ana. Bare-necked Fruitcrows Gymnoderus foetidus
and Paradise Tanagers T. chilensis.
The next day involved some relatively easy birding as we walked a
number of trails cut in the forest behind our hotel. A flock of 10 Crimson-
bellied Conures Pyrrhura rhodogaster were seen. This is a bird previously
kept at Chester Zoo, the breeding of which in 1976 was a UK first. Our
birds were later sent to Rotterdam Zoo to join their breeding group. Although
an extreme avicultural rarity, the Crimson-bellied Conure is presently

considered to be safe in the wild. It was, nonetheless, extremely gratifying
to see such a beautiful bird in its native range. Other brightly-coloured
birds included Turquoise Tanagers T. mexicana and their yelping calls
betrayed the identity of a group of Cuvier's Toucans. The real highlights
were two White-browed Hawks Leucopternis kuhli (a very uncommon bird
confined to Brazil and Peru and listed by ICBP as near-threatened), and
excellent views of an Amazonian Pygmy Owl Glaucidium hardyi. The
latter species was described only recently and our individual responded to
the playback of its distinctive calls by flying to investigate the 'newcomer'
in its territory.
The next stage of our journey involved taking a small boat along the
Teles Pires River (a tributary of the Amazon) and then up along its smaller
source - the River Cristalino. That journey was excellent and we were
rewarded with good views of Swallow-winged Puffbirds Chelidoptera
tenebrosa, Swallow-tailed Kites Elanoides forficatus and White-banded
Swallows Atticora fasciata.
The 'jungle lodge' at the end of this boat trip was our base for the next
four days. Trails in this area were thick and seeing birds was very difficult.
Nonetheless, some really good birds were found including such 'zoo' birds
as Blue and Yellow A. ararauna and Scarlet Macaws A. macao, Amazonian
Umbrellabirds Cephalopterus ornatus and Dark-winged Trumpeters
Psophia viridis. Blue and Yellow Macaws were watched prospecting for
nest sites in dead palm trunks and a pair of Blue-headed Parrots roosted in
a tree hole close to our night quarters. A series of wooden slats were nailed,
ladder-like, up this tree to the height of the roost hole. Presumably this
was a regular nest site from which chicks were regularly 'harvested'. Brazil
does not permit export of its birds so I suspect the chicks would have been
sold locally.
Other parrots seen in these forests included Orange-winged Amazons
A. amazonica, White-bellied Caiques Pionites leucogaster and Painted
Conures P. picta. Mammals seen included three tapirs swimming down
river and a group of Black Spider Monkeys. The exhilarating experience
of being woken at 4am by the surrounding wall of sound created by chorusing
Howler Monkeys was incredible. So intensely deep and loud was this dawn-
chorus that it could be felt as well as heard. Working the trails and striking
into the forest off the trails produced a large number of 'difficult' birds
including many species of antwrens and such celebrated obscurities as
Snethlage's Snethlagea minor and Zimmer's Idioptilon aenigma Tody
Tyrants.
Arriving at the tiny airstrip for our return flight to Cuiaba, we found
our small aircraft surrounded by armed guards. With sirens blaring a Brink's
van raced across the runway and very heavy crates (gold was panned locally)

were loaded into the plane. A gun-toting guard accompanied us on the
flight to Cuiaba. This was the most awful flight I have ever experienced.
The whole journey was spent travelling through smoke-filled air from
burning rainforest. The scale of deforestation and land degradation was
greater than I had expected. Brazil was then burning and destroying 8.5
million acres of rainforest each year.
Species presently considered 'safe', including Crimson-bellied Conures,
really are only as safe as the forest areas they inhabit. The forests are vast
beyond belief, but so it would appear is man's greed. Zoos like Chester
now have to concentrate their captive breeding programmes on those species
immediately endangered, but must educate their visitors to the fundamental
problems of habitat destruction.
The following day we revisited the area south of Chapada and scored
where we had previously failed in seeing Red and Green A. chloroptera
and Blue-winged Macaws A. maracana, and Burrowing Owls Speotyto
cunicularia. The scenery in the area around Chapada dos Guimares was
outstanding with high inland cliffs and waterfalls and the sight of Red and
Green Macaws winging their way across a forested canyon can only be
described as magnificent.
Another flight that evening (our itinerary was extremely tight!) took us
to the ultra-modern capital of Brasilia whose city plan is in the shape of an
aeroplane. We had only one morning available to explore Brasilia National
Park. An excellent couple of hours in this cerrado habitat were spent
watching Yellow-faced Amazons A. xanthops and finding a pair of the
increasingly scarce Cock-tailed Tyrants Alectrurus tricolor (a small
flycatcher in which the male has a tail shaped like a cockerel's).
A late afternoon flight took us to Vitoria on Brazil's Atlantic coast.
The Atlantic rainforests now exist only as remnant patches having been
reduced to 4% of their original area and hold some of the world's most
endangered birds. Two areas of particular importance are the privately
owned Linhares Forest Reserve and the nearby Sooretama Forest Reserve.
The CVRD Linhares Reserve is owned by the Campanhia Vale do Rio
Doce (CVRD) and was set up 40 years ago to supply timber for railway
sleepers. The enlightened attitude of this major company in preserving
this area, promoting field research and setting up on-site captive breeding
facilities can only be commended.
A visit to the CVRD breeding facilities showed the success of their
captive breeding programme for the Solitary Tinamou Tinamus solitarius.
Unfortunately their captive pair of the highly endangered Red-billed
Curassow C. blumenhachii had not been successful. Only 200 of these
birds are believed to remain and it was certainly one of the species we most
wanted to see at Linhares.

Our first morning's survey was rewarded with the sight of one male
and two female Red-billed Curassows as they walked up and across a forest
trail at the far end of the reserve. This was followed by a brief encounter
with one of the world's rarest primates, the Woolly Spider Monkey. The
area proved very productive and after several days our species inventory
for this reserve included Rusty-margined Guans P. superciliaris ,
Reichenow's Blue-headed Parrot P. m. reichenowi , Red-browed Amazons
A. rhodocorytha, White-eared Conures R leucotis and my target bird, the
Blue-throated Conure R cruentata. A pair of the latter species has been
kept at Chester for several years but although eggs have been laid (and in
1991 and 1995 chicks were hatched), success still eludes us for this important
species.
Other memorable birds seen at CVRD Linhares included Bare-throated
Bel)birds Procnias nudicollis , White-crowned Manakin Pipra pipra and a
tiny hummingbird, the Minute Hermit Rhaethornis idaliae. Perhaps most
unexpected of all was a beautifully marked Yellow-footed Tortoise deep
inside the forest.
Another welcome surprise was a Red-rumped Agouti which quickly
ran across one of the forest tracks. The closest we came to seeing the regal
Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja was to poke a stick at the carcase of a Maned
Three-toed Sloth which it had killed the previous day. A Brazilian
ornithology student researching the feeding habits of the parrots at Linhares
had watched the Harpy Eagle attacking this unfortunate sloth and clearly
enjoyed recounting how close the eagle had been to him. The awful feeling
an avid birdwatcher gets on being told in detail about birds he has missed
is difficult to describe - we certainly had been 'gripped' on this one!
The visit to Sooretama Forest Reserve was all too brief. Having spent
longer than we expected at Linhares, we only had one morning at Sooretama
but succeeded in getting many telescope views of at least two male White-
winged Cotingas Xipholena atropurpurea. These, like so many other
Atlantic forest birds, are highly endangered through the destruction and
fragmentation of these forests. An unexpected bonus was a Rufous capped
Ant-Thrush Formicarius colma which performed for us by giving stunning
views in the open before again disappearing into thick forest vegetation.
Leaving Sooretama, we drove to Santa Teresa where we hoped to be
able to see a good selection of rarer hummingbirds. Our destination was
the former home of the late Professor Augusto Ruschi, a world expert on
hummingbirds who is now commemorated on one of Brazil's banknotes.
We were delighted to be allowed onto the veranda of his widow's house to
watch and photograph the wild hummingbirds attracted to the nectar feeders.

A total of 15 species were seen including the magnificent Black Jacobin
Melanotrochilus fuscus, Brazilian Ruby Clytolaema ruhricauda Violet-
capped Woodnymph Thalurania glaucopis, Glittering-throated Emerald
Amaziliafimhriata , and an exquisite Frilled Coquette L. magnifica. Similar
to the Dot-eared Coquettes we had seen earlier at Chapada, this tiny
hummingbird was elaborately coloured and sported fancy facial frills.
Darkness forced us to leave and we headed back to Vitoria. The next
day, my last in Brazil, we caught a flight to Rio de Janeiro. A couple of
hours to spare in Rio were occupied by taking a taxi to Tijuca National
Park. There, below the statue of Christ, we had excellent views of the
normally secretive White-eyed Foliage-gleaner Automolus leucophthalmus
and saw Red-necked Tanagers T. cyanocephala. On leaving Rio I relaxed
on the plane by counting up my tally of over 470 bird species seen in a
hectic three weeks. The finer identification points of many of those birds I
have already forgotten, but the Brazilian experience will remain forever. I
wish I could guarantee the same for the future of Brazil's many rare and
threatened birds.

1 (C.K.) decided to study the Grey-headed Olive-back Nesocharis
capistrata because of the inadequate investigations in the field by Bates
(1930), Chapin (1954), and Serle (1940), the sparse information about it
in a more recent report from Zaire by my colleague and co-author (Brickell,
1960), and the correspondingly vague information about this species in
captivity.
The olive-backs - there are three species - are characterised by their
rounded wings, medium length tail and sharp-pointed bill, with a slight
hook on the tip of the upper mandible. They are possibly most closely
related to the crimson-wings Cryptospiza spp.

Neville Brickell's photo gives a good idea of the Grey-headed Olive-
back's appearance. Descriptions of it have been given by a number of
authors and further comment here is therefore unnecessary, except to note
that in worn plumage the green feathers may very well appear to be darker
and the wing tips yellower, giving a somewhat streaky effect. Alternative
names for this species include White-cheeked Olive-back and White-cheeked
Waxbill.

It is found in coastal West Africa from Gambia and Benin, through
central Nigeria and Cameroon to north-eastern Zaire, extreme south-western
Sudan and south-western Uganda, There it frequents savanna bush, riparian
woodland near swamps, forest edges and clearings. N.B. found that no
more than five birds formed a family group. They foraged among the
leaves of plants in a rather warbler-like way, feeding on seeds and include
in their diet, those of wild figs and grasses. Small insects, notably ants and
caterpillars, and also small snails have been recorded as forming part of
their diet. In three separate observations, N.B. never saw them feeding on
the ground, although they are said to do so.
The nest described by Chapin appears to be the only one found to date.
Three metres (9ft 7in) above the ground in a thick bush, it was constructed
of grass stems and dry weeds and measured 18cm (Tin) from top to bottom,
with the entrance hole rather high up. The fact that it was unlined, suggests
it was unfinished.
Prior to 1995, Grey-headed Olive-backs were available occasionally to
local aviculturists here in South Africa, but unfortunately were very
expensive and needed to be acclimatised carefully after being released from
the quarantine station. Recently I (C.K.) managed to obtain four from a
local dealer and decided to house them together in a small aviary with
single pairs of Purple Grenadiers Uraeginthus ianthinogaster, Cordon-bleus
U. angolensis , Red-faced Crimson-wings Cryptospiza reichenovii and Green
Twinspots Mandingoa nitidula. They were housed together until the end
of the non-breeding season, which is from June until October in South
Africa. Close observations on the Grey-headed Olive-backs during this
period revealed that I had three males and only one female.
The aviary measures 33m x 1.5m x 1.8m high (lift x 5ft x 6ft high).
One side only is covered with mesh. The sleeping quarters are covered
with corrugated asbestos to reduce heat during the summer and the flight
is covered with clear corrugated perspex to allow the light to penetrate.
The only living plant life is an indigenous terrestrial fern which is restricted
to the flight area. Beneath the sleeping shelter is Khaki Weed Tagetes
minuta, which originates from South America. It produces an unpleasant
odour and is dried and then packed tightly together beneath the roof. Its
vernacular name is derived from the 4 kakies\ the British soldiers who
introduced the seeds which contaminated the hay imported for their horses
during the Boer War.
In December one male became extremely active, carrying grass and
displaying to the only female. It was not long afterwards that a nest was
being constructed of fern fronds, which had earlier been offered to the
other aviary occupants, and was lined with teff grass. The entrance was
situated at one side with a funnel attached. With the assistance of a torch,

I was later able to observe that three white eggs had been laid on alternative
days. It was at this stage of incubation that the breeding male became
aggressive towards the other two males, but not wishing to disturb the pair
unduly by removing the spare males immediately, I hoped they might tolerate
his aggressive behaviour for a little longer. Unfortunately, the decision
was disastrous, as both spare males died within a few days from severe
pecking on their foreheads.
Both pairs shared the incubation and the feeding of the nestlings. I
provided mixed millets, with additional Japanese millet and manna, plain
canary, rape, niger, paddy rice (soaked overnight), seeding grasses
(Eragrostis and Panicum spp.), germinating Japanese millet, locally
manufactured Avi-plus Canary rearing food, to which was added finely
grated apple, and there was a constant supply of mound termites. They
were also provided with finely grated cuttlefish bone, shell grit, beach sand
and charcoal.
Three young left the nest. They differed from their parents in having
the entire head including the nape a darker shade of grey and the back and
wings more greyish and less olive. The breast and belly were a darker
grey, and the flanks reddish olive. The bill was whitish with a greenish tip.
The pair went to nest a second time. This time only two of the three
eggs hatched. The incubation period was 15 days, calculated to the day the
second egg hatched. The nestling period was 23 days, calculated to the day
the second chick left the nest. The third egg, which was addled, measured
16mm x 12mm.
At the South African National Cage Bird Association Conference in
late July, Chris Koen was awarded the Gold Medal for the 'Breeding of the
Year'.

THE BLUE-THROATED MACAW EEP SCHEME
</sectionHeader>

by Roger G. Sweeney
The Blue-throated Macaw Am glaucogularis was practically unknown
both in the wild and in captivity until as recently as the early 1980s, when
a small number began to appear in captivity. The first breeding was recorded
in 1984. Subsequently an increased number of wild-caught birds entered
North American and European aviculture, until the trade was curtailed
when the species was placed on Appendix 1 of the CITES convention.
Captive breeding has continued to increase, particularly in North
America where it is now well established. The European population which
formerly comprised of a handful of wild-caught birds imported in the early
1980s, has grown as a result of captive breeding and from captive-bred
birds imported from North America.
Until very recently the wild population had not been studied and little
was known about it, except that it was centred upon the Department of
Beni in central Bolivia, where very little exact data had been collected
regarding its status there. It had always been thought that the wild
population was small due to natural constraints, such as the availability of
suitable habitat, with an estimate of 2,000 birds being circulated. The
trapping of wild birds undoubtedly reduced this figure, but to what extent
was uncertain. Even its exact range remained undefined.
It was not until 1993 that a team of Bolivian biologists funded by the

documented the approximate range of the Blue-throated Macaw in the wild.
Since then the same team of biologists from the Bolivian 'Armenia'
organisation has continued to study this species and in 1995, funded
principally on this occasion by the Loro Barque Foundation, carried out an
extensive survey to establish the true status of this species. The results
were shocking. After extensive field surveys it was estimated that the
remaining wild population of Blue-throated Macaws probably numbers less
than 100, restricted to the Beni region of Bolivia. Always considered to be
extremely rare, the Blue-throated Macaw must now be recognised as perhaps
the most threatened of the large macaws.
A proposal to form an EEP (European Species Survival) scheme for the
Blue-throated Macaw was officially submitted by Loro Barque in early 1994
and approved later the same year. Loro Barque achieved the first captive
breeding of this species back in 1984 and has been breeding it ever since,
and has built up a sizeable number of birds which belong now to the Loro
Barque Foundation. Elsewhere in Europe, five other zoological collections
also keep the Blue-throated Macaw, but only one of these has so far been
successful in breeding this species. A substantial number of Blue-throated
Macaws are maintained by private keepers and some have been successful

in breeding this macaw. However, encouraging such private keepers to
participate fully in the EEP has proved difficult and the history of many
individual birds is difficult to establish because of poor record keeping and
because many individual birds have entered Europe from North American
aviculture.
At present no regional programme exists for the Blue-throated Macaw
in the USA or any other geographical region, other than the European
EEP. It has therefore been proposed that the existing European regional
studbook should be extended into an international studbook for the Blue-
throated Macaw.
The first edition of the European regional studbook, up until the year
ending December 1995, was produced in June 1996. It has become clear
that a number of private keepers of this species would be willing to
participate in a European studbook, but would not be willing to sign their
birds over to a full EEP scheme commitment. Therefore the studbook
includes data on all known birds, but concentrates data analysis only on
birds which are part of the EEP population, whose histories have been
recorded more fully and are committed by their owners to remain within
the boundaries of the programme. The first section, therefore, is presented
as an historical studbook, listing all known birds that could be traced,
whether they were part of the EEP or not. It lists 74, but it is hoped that
this figure can be amended upwards in future editions, if more data is
forthcoming from private keepers. The second section concentrates on the
EEP population and is a current report on existing EEP birds. It documents
37 Blue-throated Macaws which are committed to the EEP population, all
of them held in zoological gardens. A demographic and genetic analysis
of these birds follows. The conclusions reached in this first studbook are
that for many European birds which were hatched in North America, an
accurate history of their parentage still needs to be ascertained. Also many
more of the population's founder birds need to become reproductively active.
The studbook ends with a report from Alan Hesse, the project coordinator
for 'Armonia', who is leading the field survey on the Blue-throated Macaw.
Two years after approval for the EEP was granted, the following points
have become clear. Progress has been slow in trying to encourage private
keepers to participate in the programme and in trying to gain accurate data
about the history of many birds bred outside Europe. The Blue-throated
Macaw has the potentiality to breed successfully, but the limited success
achieved in Europe so far, indicates that it has to be managed more carefully
if the population is to be viable in the long-term.
Clearly, far more birds of a greater diversity of bloodlines need to become
reproductively successful, if the population is to grow in a balanced fashion.
Most of all, it has been realised for same years that the establishment of a
self-sustaining captive population is advantageous for conservation reasons,
but it is only with the most recent disturbing report from Bolivia that the

LAST CHANCE TO DECLARE SPIX'S MACAWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9993455625" page_id="56261020"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
It is the last chance for any remaining holders of captive Spix's Macaws
Cyanopsitta spixii to declare them to the Brazilian Government for inclusion
in the globally managed population. The wild population of Spix's Macaw,
the world's rarest bird, was reduced to a single male by a combination of
pressures including habitat loss and removal of birds from the wild for the
captive trade. Taking the most pragmatic route forward in the best interest
of this species' conservation, in 1990, the Brazilian Government formed
the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix's Macaw (CPRAA),
and issued a Decree which invited all holders of this species to enter their
birds into a globally managed population.
Holders in Brazil, the Philippines, Spain and Switzerland have declared
their C. spixii and have complied with the management recommendations
of the committee, in particular to pair individuals to promote breeding and
retain genetic diversity, and to release an adult female in March 1995, to
pair with the wild male.
During the past five and a half years, an intensive programme of
protection, habitat restoration, environmental education and community
involvement has been in operation in north-eastern Brazil, where the wild
male and released female live. This programme has been financed
principally by the Loro Parque Foundation (a member of the committee),
overseen by the Brazilian Institute of Environmental and Natural Renewable
Resources (IBAMA) of the Ministry of Environment.
Although the globally managed captive population is breeding and
increasing, it remains small and would benefit from the addition of more
founder individuals. Therefore, the Brazilian Government has issued a
further Decree which permits any holders of hitherto undeclared captive
Spix's Macaws to enter them into the managed population. This must be
done by 30th October 1996. After this date, the Brazilian Government will
no longer permit the voluntary declaration of any captive Spix's Macaws
which have remained outside the globally managed population, and will
work with the relevant authorities to confiscate any undeclared birds as
and when the opportunity arises.

Three species have successfully reproduced for the first time at London
Zoo in 1996. A White Woodpecker fledged in July, 2 Bali Mynahs have
been reared from two pairs received from Jersey Wildlife Trust last year,
and a Black-faced Ibis chick hatched in an incubator in early July after the
adult female died on the nest of egg peritonitis. The second egg in the
clutch was infertile.
The zoo's Red-billed Hombill pair also bred, but the male died shortly
before the eggs were due to hatch so the clutch was taken for artificial
incubation. One egg hatched and the young bird was reared without
problem.
Recent arrivals include 2 Yellow-fronted Tinkerbirds (both bred by
M. &amp; N. Curzon at Rode), 1 male Plumbeous Redstart (bred at Chester
Zoo), 2 Magpie Robins, 2 Shama Thrushes, 2 Black-necked Aracaris,
1 Sulawesi Mynah, 1 Abdim's Stork, 2 female Hyacinth Macaws (from
Birds International in the Philippines) and 3 Silver-throated Tanagers. Most
of the Passerines are species that have been recommended for management
by the Zoo Federation's Passerine Taxon Advisory Group. We are very
keen to obtain more Silver-throated Tanagers, should anyone know of odd
birds anywhere.

THE PRESIDENT'S GARDEN PARTY 1996
by Stewart Pyper
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.970652634146342" page_id="56261025"  page_num="86" year="" vol="">
On Sunday 19th May almost 90 members and their guests travelled
from various parts of the country to view the marvellous collection of birds
kept by our President, Miss Ruth Ezra, and Vice-President, Raymond
Sawyer, at Cobham, Surrey. They must surely have one of the finest private
collections. It includes not only birds, but tortoises and other reptiles, and
various mammals, plus a wonderful collection of trees and plants, including
a selection of succulents.
What gave us all particular pleasure was to see Raymond in fine spirits
after his major operation last Autumn. It may not have been appreciated
by all those present that it was our 21st annual visit. The first was in 1976.
I wonder how many of us have attended all 21?
The weather in May was variable, being generally cooler than usual,
and the afternoon mirrored this. During tea there was a tremendous
downpour of rain, but there were also some sunny spells. Raymond believed
that most plants were up to a month behind in flowering and this combined
with an earlier than usual visit meant that it coincided with the
rhododendrons being in full colour.
The walk around the garden was not as long as usual due to the fact
that a Demoiselle Crane was sitting. However, we saw thicknees, Red-
crested Touracos and Island Thrushes in the garden aviary. In the paddock
range of four flights we saw Keas, Kookaburras, Satyr Tragopans, lutino
Princess of Wales Parrakeets, and a Blue Whistling Thrush. The latter was
separated from its mate as they had started fighting. For those of you who
do not know them, these birds can be killers. Those who bypassed the
'Jewel Cage' missed seeing various Gouldian Finch mutations (not to
everyone's taste), Red-headed Parrot Finches, Painted Finches and a pair
of Quail Finches.
The flock of flamingos on the lake had not yet started nesting but various
ducks and geese were sitting, 'Emma', Ruth and Raymond's tame female
Stanley Crane was roaming free. The lakeside aviary houses Scarlet Ibis,
Masked Plovers, Giant Spotted Laughing Thrushes and I counted at least
four Azure-winged Magpies.
Most of the collection is housed in a variety of aviaries to the rear of the
house. What is known as the 'Waterfall Aviary' contains a magnificent
pair of Blue-bellied Rollers, and hopes are high that they will breed. Other
birds in the aviary include Royal or Golden-breasted Starlings, Hoopoes,
Grandalas, White-capped Redstarts, and Avocets which were nesting. As
last summer was so hot, it presented problems for the Grandalas, as they
disliked the long, hot, dry days. The adjacent flight contains Green Wood
Hoopoes and a female Violaceous Touraco which will attack the female
keeper, if she enters the aviary.

Blue-faced Honeyeaters have nested and hand-rearing was being
attempted, because in the past eggs had disappeared. The pair of Choughs
appear to be two females, as nine eggs have been laid but none have been
fertile. A Magpie Tanager which has been at Cobham for sometime shares
a flight with Red-winged and Red-tailed Laughing Thrushes, and a pair of
lutino Princess of Wales Parrakeets.
The tropical house is always admired, as much for the plants as for the
birds, which can sometimes be difficult to see. Among those I saw were a
pitta, Long-tailed and Lesser Green Broadbills, Black-chinned Yuhinas,
Splendid Sunbirds, and a Golden Bush Chat.
Three Carmine Bee-eaters occupy a flight which has a host of succulents
tastefully arranged on the floor. The range of six heated indoor flights
contain a flock of Red-headed Tits, Fukien and Greater Niltavas, Roulroul
Partridges, a Banded Pitta, Paradise Tanagers which have hatched young,
Blue-naped Chlorophonias which have also hatched young, White-throated
Bee-eaters, Mrs Gould's and Scarlet-chested Sunbirds, various flycatchers,
a Golden-headed Quetzal and a Rhodospingus Finch.
One of three flights which are covered over house a pair of Bartlett's
Bleeding-heart Pigeons which have nested and a pair of Black-cheeked
Woodpeckers, which may have had young in their nesting log at the time
of our visit. The two main aviaries, as I call them, and the adjacent flights
contain Splendid, Emerald and Violet-backed Starlings, pygmy geese,
Livingstone's Touracos, more Avocets, Black-necked Stilts, various laughing
thrushes, Philippine Hanging Parrots which were nesting, Stella's Lories,
grosbeaks, Toco Toucans, a Rufous Motmot, and many more birds, including
various fruit doves.
A pair of Cardinal Lories reminded me immediately of its near relative
the Yellow-streaked Lory.
Following the usual delicious tea, taken inside by most people because
the weather was changing, our Hon. Secretary and Treasurer, Geoffrey
Greed, thanked our hosts for their kind hospitality. Ruth and Raymond
donated all the monies from the ticket sales, amounting to over #630.00, to
the Society's funds, for which we are all most grateful. Whilst we were all
together our President presented medals for first UK breedings to five
members who were present:-

Elliot's Monograph of the Hornbills
</title>
<author confidence="0.634415">
Dutchman Jan Gerard Keulemans (1842-1912) was undoubtedly one
</author>
<bodyText confidence="0.992846259259259" page_id="56261027"  page_num="88" year="" vol="">
of the best bird artists of his era. In 1868 he came to England to illustrate
such journals as Ibis and the Proceedings of the Zoological Society. His
beautiful plates which adorned Elliot's Monograph of the Bucerotidae or
family of the Hornbills must have created much interest when the book
was published in 1882. At that time little was known of the natural history
of this group of birds. Indeed, the information on some species in this
book is exceeded in length by the list of synonyms for that species. Anyone
today who needs solid information will refer to Alan Kemp's informative
and readable The Hornbills (Oxford University Press, 1995).
A facsimile of Elliot's original book has been published in Germany by
Fundace f Verlag. Additional pages at the end of the book provide scientific,
German and English names in use today, distribution maps and a list of the
names used by Elliot alongside recent nomenclature.
After waiting two years for its publication I have to admit to being
disappointed. The small page size 8Vfcin (21cm) x lOin (31cm) has resulted
in some of the plates being slightly cropped. In a book which costs #170
this is not pleasing. Indeed, I complained to the bookseller and was told
that I could return the book. I then realised that I could not bear to be
parted from Keulemans' exquisite plates so I placed the book on a stand
and open it at a different plate daily. I feast my eyes on the Red-billed
Hornbill about to pick a beetle off a tree limb or on the pair of extraordinary
Fantee White-crested Hornbills.
This is not an easy book to use as there are no page numbers. It is
definitely for the lover of hornbills and of birds portrayed in fine art, rather
than for the seeker of information. It can be ordered from specialist natural
history booksellers, such as Wheldon &amp; Wesley Ltd., Lytton Lodge, Codicote,
Hitchen, Herts. SG4 8TE, England. Tel: 01438 820370/Fax: 01438 821478.

A Guide to...Pigeons, Doves and Quail
The eighth in its A Guide to... series, Pigeons, Doves and Quail
reinforces Australian Birdkeepefs aim to publish 'high quality, informative
literature for birdlovers'. It is solid with information, and with useful and
beautiful photographs. Immediately apparent from the text is the fact that
the author, Danny Brown, has substantial practical experience. Indeed, he
has kept 32 of the species described and consistently breeds 22 of them -
and he is only in his mid-twenties!
As a veterinary nurse currently studying veterinary science, he can
write with authority about every aspect of his subject. The text is weighty
and impressive. It commences with detailed information on housing,
feeding, handling, 'reproductive manipulation' (artificial incubation), hand-
rearing, choosing stock, diseases and administration of medications. In
the second part of the book the author discusses every species of pigeon
and quail available in Australian aviculture. The detail is remarkable and
extends over three to four pages for each species, and includes photographs
of excellent quality - three or more for each species and almost all of them
in colour. More than 160 colour photographs make this book a valuable
identification guide as well as adding greatly to the readers' enjoyment.
The text includes valuable information on the natural food of each species
and the correct diet for captive birds. Notes on breeding are also extensive.
Concluding the information for each species, Danny Brown acknowledges
the help of various aviculturists who have supplied information which has
helped to form such a comprehensive text. However, the fact that he draws
extensively on his own experience is very apparent. As an example, he
recommends that Bob white Quail chicks which are being artificially reared
should be kept on a floor covering of turkey starter crumbs. This is because
they are apt to ingest sand, sawdust, newspaper or similar floor coverings.
Although this book was written primarily for Australian aviculturists,
and some of the species of Australian pigeons are not available abroad, this
in no way detracts from the usefulness of the book. No one with an interest
in pigeons can fail to find much of value and interest within its 184 glossy
pages.
It is available from Owl's Nest Bookshop, Birdworld, Farnham, Surrey
GU10 4LD, England. UK price #16.95. In Australia it costs A$29.95,
plus postage, from Australian Birdkeeper.

Hybrid Ducks - A contribution towards an inventory
Thirty years ago, when I joined The Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge as a
warden, one of the pens that most fascinated me was the one devoted to the
trust's 'mistakes' or hybrids - the progeny of unintentional and certainly
unwanted breedings. It was great fun trying to work out the respective
parentages.
As I became involved in the more vital business of breeding rare species
and keeping them pure (viz. the fate of the White-headed Duck in Spain
through the invasion of Ruddy Duck genes) my interest dwindled. Hybrids
are something of a freak show or of purely academic interest. To be fair,
Eric and Barry Gillham, the authors of this attractive and well written
little softback book (104 pages including 16 of colour photographs) do not
claim otherwise.
'Trainspotters', waterfowl specialists and those interested in nature's
oddities will find this a meticulous and useful contribution to their library.
This book is available from B.L. Gillham, RO. Box 563, Wallington,
Surrey SM6 9DX, England. It is priced #14.00 plus #1.00 p&amp;p (#2.00
overseas).

ANOTHER WORLD FIRST FOR SAN DIEGO ZOO
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9647564" page_id="56261030"  page_num="91" year="" vol="">
The world's first captive-bred Crowned Eagle Stephanoaetus coronatus
has hatched at San Diego Zoo. The female is only four years old and it was
thought she might have been too young to breed, while the male was believed
to be possibly too old. To stimulate breeding activity, keepers built a nest
before the birds were paired and additional nesting material was left in
their aviary. Remarkably, they started building immediately upon being
introduced. By Christmas they had completed a massive nest measuring
some 2.4m (8ft) across. The female laid an egg in March and the pair took
turns to sit. Incubation lasted 52 days and the eaglet hatched 22nd April
1996.

Captive-reared 3-5 months old Malleefowl Leipoa ocellata failed to
survive beyond 104 days, when experimentally released into Yathong Nature

introduced Red Fox. It accounted for at least 50% and may have accounted
for as high as 92%. Twelve older Malleefowl released into the reserve
fared better - three of them survived beyond 15 months. Foxes, habitat
clearance and fragmentation, habitat degeneration and changes to fire
regimes are considered to be the main causes of the overall decline of this
species. Details of the experiment were published in Emu, Vol. 96:32-41.

will be teaching at the Universidade Estadual Paulista (State University of
Sao Paulo) in Brazil. It has 775 faculty and students members and the
main research is ecology and natural history of the biodiversity of the
Atlantic forest.
The main problem in conservation biology in Brazil is finding qualified
people to continue long-term research projects, management and
environmental education. The Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP)
is contacting several young Brazilian researchers with PhDs from abroad
that could help train more qualified researchers and students in Brazil.
Libraries are essential for research and are a main priority for the
Universidade Estadual Paulista. Unfortunately, Brazilian universities are
critically short of money to subscribe to journals and buy books. Mauro
Galetti is seeking someone willing to donate a subscription to the Avicultural

NOTES ON HAND-REARING A TAWNY FROGMOUTH AT
THE OKLAHOMA CITY ZOOLOGICAL PARK
</sectionHeader>

The Oklahoma City Zoological Park had since May 1986 exhibited a
single male Tawny Frogmouth Podargus strigoides in a cage approximately
8ft x 8ft x 12ft (2.4m x 2.4m x 3.6m). Because of the difficulty in securing
a female frogmouth, it was not until 1990 that the male was paired with a
young female from San Antonio Zoo.
Although the pair was not often observed perching together, it was
evident that there was no aggression between them. The male appeared
much larger than the female and there was some concern for her safety,
especially in view of the fact that the female was a hand-reared bird weighing
347.5g, and the male, at 550g, outweighed her by approximately 63%.
While the two were largely sedentary during the day, after several weeks it
was obvious that they were active during the hours of darkness, for the
limbs and substrate showed signs of the birds' nightly activities, which
eventually began to include nest building. A small bowl-shaped wire
platform with sphagnum moss, located in the middle of the exhibit on a
stout perch, was selected by the birds. Initially, two eggs were laid and
incubation by the male during the day commenced immediately.
Unfortunately, the flimsy nest consisting of a few twigs and leaves did not
prove sufficient to cushion the eggs and both were found broken in the next
three days. The decision was then made to remove the next egg and attempt
to hand-rear the chick.
On 17th May 1991, a further egg was laid. It was removed and placed
in an incubator at a temperature of 98.5*F (36.9*C) and the wet bulb at 84-
85%. On the 29th day, the egg pipped properly and hatched normally on
the 30th day. The chick was allowed to dry for 24 hours and then placed in
an infant care isolette at a temperature of 90*F (32.2*C), where it seemed
comfortable. The chick was covered with long white down which turned
grey over the next few weeks. Initially, the chick was offered bits of finely
chopped pinkies at 8.00am, 11.00am, 2.00pm, 5.00pm and 8.00pm. It
accepted these readily as well as %in (7mm) crickets which were offered

once a day. The food was sprinkled with Vionate powder. The hand-
rearing was fairly uneventful with the bird increasing its food intake
gradually over the seven week hand-rearing period and weigh gain was
fairly steady as indicated on the accompanying graph.

After the first two week period the temperature of the isolette was reduced
gradually by approximately 5*F (2.8*C) until it reached room temperature
on approximately 16th July 1991. At this time, the bird weighed 197.9g
and was being offered whole pinkies, crickets with the legs removed and
chopped mice. On 18th July 1991, the bird was transferred from the isolette
to a brooder-box equipped with perches, food and water, and hand-feeding
continued until it was eating on its own on 31st July. The bird began flying
on the 23rd July, during hand-feeding sessions, and care had to be taken to
prevent it injuring itself. Later in 1991 it was sexed as a male and sent to
Riverbanks Zoo.

Of all the Australian finches, the Gouldian Finch Chloebia gouldiae
has the most pronounced breeding cycle. Failure to understand the needs
of the species can often lead to disappointing breeding results.
Before placing the birds in their breeding quarters, one should ensure
that both the male and the female are in full breeding condition. It is usual
for females when in breeding condition to have beaks which are almost
black in colour. However, this is not always so, as I have had females go to
nest and successfully rear young with little or no colour change to their
beaks. More obvious signs are when a female is seen to become 'heavy'
around the area of the vent, with a pronounced rise to the rump and with
the tail held in a downwards position.
The females of many Australian finches, when eager to nest, often lay
eggs on the floor of the cage, even when they are housed alone or with
others of the same sex. I have never experienced this with Gouldians,
although females which have already reared two rounds of chicks and have
then been placed in resting cages (see later), will occasionally lay one or
two eggs immediately after being removed from their breeding quarters.
Males in breeding condition usually have an almost white beak, with
only the tip coloured. When eager to nest, males continually hang on the
bars of their cage, calling almost continuously to the females. The latter
will usually answer them.
Pairs should be placed in their breeding quarters at the same time, or
alternatively the male can be placed in the breeding cage a few days before
the female is introduced. Under no circumstances should the female be
placed in the cage before the male, otherwise she may prove so dominant
that the male will never assert itself and mating will not take place.
Nest-boxes should be placed in position before the birds are introduced
to their breeding quarters. Gouldian Finches can prove to be poor nest
builders, many pairs rarely taking any material into the nest. Because of
this, the boxes should first be filled with soft hay into which one has pushed
one's fist to make a nest hollow.
Some pairs may add material to the nest and because of this, a certain
amount of soft hay should be placed on the floor of the breeding cage. Under
the nest-box is the ideal place to put it as this will help prevent the material
becoming soiled with droppings. The type of hay used is most important.
Gouldians appear to move about in the nest, especially during incubation and
if short pieces of hay are supplied, these, due to the movement of the birds,
often become so brittle that eventually they cover the eggs, thus causing the
pair to desert their eggs. I always supply pieces at least 23cm (9in) in length.
It is also important to supply hay which is as fresh as possible.

One day old Gouldian Finch chicks. Note the type of hay used in nest building.
Gouldian pairs in peak breeding condition will usually go down to nest
within 14 days of being placed together. Mating usually takes place in the
nest (I have yet to observe a pair mating from a perch). Although either
one or both birds may spend a certain amount of time in the nest soon after
egg laying has commenced, actual incubation will not commence until the
final egg of the clutch is laid. Both birds share incubation during the hours
of daylight, however, only the female incubates during the night period
and it is rare to find a male which remains on the nest overnight. If it does,
then one can almost guarantee that it is not actually incubating.
The eggs take between 12-14 days to hatch and when the chicks are ten
days old, the parents cease to brood them. If one intends to fit closed-rings
on the chicks, then this is the time to do so, as well-fed Gouldian chicks are
ready at ten days old. The chicks leave the nest when they are approximately
25 days old. When they are one month old, I always remove the nest-box,
otherwise the parents may attempt to go to nest before their young are fully
weaned.
The chicks should be seen to be feeding themselves by the time they are
five to six weeks old. They can then be removed and placed in 'growing
on' accommodation. If the breeding cage is then thoroughly cleaned and
the nest-box (which should have been cleaned when it was removed earlier)
placed in position again, the breeding pair should commence their second
clutch within a week or so.

Gouldian Finch chicks at 9 days old.
The Gouldian is the only Australian finch from which I remove the
nest-box between each clutch. If the nest-box is left in position, there is
every possibility that the second clutch of eggs will prove infertile, due to
the breeding pair being unable mate properly because of interference from
their chicks.
When breeding pairs have successfully reared two rounds of chicks, the
sexes are segregated and housed in 1.8m (6ft) cages to rest and moult.
Gouldians will breed successfully in roomy cages or in aviaries.
However, they should be housed in the latter only during the warmer months
of year and even then, the nest-boxes should always be placed in the shelter.
When breeding, Gouldians require the temperature to be not less than 18*C
(64*F). If kept at lower temperatures, there is a possibility the chicks will
succumb, due to the parents ceasing to brood when the former are ten days
old. Non-breeding birds can be kept at lower temperatures, but even then
I would not recommend the temperature be allowed to fall much lower
than 15*C (59*F) - especially during the moult - if the birds are to remain
fit and healthy.
Gouldians revel in heat. On hot summer days the temperature in my
indoor birdroom may reach as much as 30*C (86*F). In spite of this, I have

yet to witness a Gouldian Finch which has shown any signs of stress when
experiencing such high temperatures.
My breeding cages, which are of the box-type, i.e. enclosed on all sides
except for the front which is fitted with a conventional style punch bar cage
front, are 91cm x 41cm x 41cm (36in x 16in x 16in). I consider this to be
the minimum size for successful breeding. One can of course use larger
cages if one so wishes. All are painted pale green on the inside (I use vinyl
emulsion) and black outside with the cage fronts also painted black (one
can use either blackboard paint or black emulsion). White cage fronts, or
those left unpainted make it difficult to view the inmates. The overall
length of each of my cages is in fact 1.8m (6ft). During the breeding
season a plywood divider is placed in the centre. Out of the breeding
season, the dividers are removed and the cages then prove ideal for young
birds or resting adults. I would recommend than no more than ten birds
are housed in a 1.8m (6ft) cage.
The basic diet consists of white and panicum millet, plus plain canary
seed. These seeds are fed in separate bowls rather than given as a mixture
as I find that not only does this avoid waste, it also means that breeding
pairs which may be partial to a certain type of seed, can take such seeds
more quickly and thus feed their chicks more readily. Mineralised and fine
oyster shell grit is available permanently, as is cuttlefish bone. A piece is
placed in a clip attached to the cage front and breeding pairs are supplied
with flaked cuttlefish bone. Every other day a small amount is placed on
top of the grit. The shells from hens' eggs are also supplied regularly.
These are first placed in boiling water and allowed to simmer for about 15
minutes, after which they are removed and allowed to thoroughly dry out
before being stored in a screw-top jar ready for use. I find that Gouldian
Finches prefer these shells to be offered in fairly large pieces rather than
being broken into small fragments (as I do for my other Australian finches).
Any pieces which have not been eaten within a few hours are removed
from the cage and discarded.
Gouldian females are particularly keen on charcoal granules and these
are permanently available in a small bowl on the cage floor. Adult pairs
with chicks are supplied with sprouted seeds regularly each day. Weaned
chicks are also offered these seeds until they have moulted into full adult
plumage. I use 50/50 budgerigar mixture, as I find this far superior to
foreign finch mix as usually the latter contains large amounts of panicum
millet, which proves almost impossible to sprout. Certain pairs may be
persuaded to take a proprietary brand of egg-food which obviously proves
beneficial to the chicks. Spray millet is permanently available and
greenfood, such as freshly washed lettuce leaves, is supplied twice a day to
pairs feeding chicks and weaned chicks in immature plumage. Non-
breeding birds are offered greenfood every other day.

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE BEHAVIOUR AND CARE
OF THE CHINESE PAINTED QUAIL

For almost 15 years, I have been involved in aviculture. After reading
a magazine article about 'Button' Quail, I became interested in raising
these birds. Of course, I soon found out that the article actually referred to
the Chinese Painted Quail Excalfactoria chinensis. I did extensive research
at university libraries trying to find out everything I could about these
fascinating little birds. This led me to articles in the Avicultural Magazine
by E.G.B. Meade-Waldo (1898), C.J.O. Harrison (1968, 1973),
C.J.O. Harrison, et al. (1965), J.J. Yealland (1962), and G.E.S. Robbins
(1979).
From earlier times to the present, my experience with these quail has
been very rewarding. I have over the years kept records of the behaviour of
my Chinese Painted Quail. Here I would like briefly to share my observations
of what I consider to be contrary or unexpected behaviour by these birds
and some of my experiences caring for them.
One of the more interesting aspects involved one of my silver females.
On a number of occasions, she would give the tid-bitting call. Her male
partner in the same cage would stop and look at her. I cannot say if he was
confused or merely pausing. To date, she is the only non-male to enunciate
this call. In contrast, I had a silver male (brother of the aforementioned
female) which would give a call of high-pitched notes in rapid succession.
This is the same call I have heard many times coming from my female
quail when they were incubating eggs and their male partner came near.
Another silver female (the mother of the aforementioned female and male)
had been plucked down the middle of her back by another quail at the
breeder's home where I bought her. After pairing her with my oldest silver
male, she proceeded to do the same to him in the very same way. A third,
normal-coloured female, was expert at aiming for the small door to her
cage. The door was about two-thirds of the way up from the bottom of the
2Vift (76cm) high cage. If I left the door unlatched, she would judge the
opening perfectly and hop out of the cage. I have a silver male which likes
to ring a little bell suspended on a wire attached to his cage. He jumps up
on his little platform where he can reach this bell and pecks at it to ring it.
I have talked with breeders who have had a great deal of trouble with
females that will not brood their eggs. Over the years, I have been fortunate
in that most of my females have brooded their eggs. In fact, one broody

female raised three hatchlings all by herself. In other cases, I have assisted
the female with her duties.
In terms of caring for them, I have seen many health conditions
manifested in my little birds. I would like to recount some of these conditions
and the treatments involved in trying to keep my quail in top shape. With
the females, I have had to be vigilant in making sure that they consume
oyster shell or calcium supplement to offset the constant egg laying that
occurs.
The very first female I had died as a result of insufficient calcium,
despite being fed this supplement, as well as a superb diet. Upon
examination by a veterinarian, she was found to have reduced bone mass.
She was losing weight and not metabolizing calcium because this was
going to producing the eggshells. In addition, the female was not
metabolizing nitrogen. Consequently, she was accumulating nitrogen in
the form of ammonia in her body. The ammonia acted as a toxin which
caused her death. Her behaviour belied her condition, for she acted normally
and produced perfect eggs. I only discovered this problem because I found
her in her cage with a broken wing. Since then, I have had another female
which laid well-developed eggs and two which produced thin-shelled eggs.
All three died as a result of becoming egg-bound.
More recently, another female was acting lethargic and had, I discovered,
a swelling in her abdomen. Over the previous few months, I had noticed
that the female, which was only a little over one year old, was laying eggs
with thin shells. I decided that she had an impacted oviduct. I gave her an
antibiotic which reduced the swelling considerably but not entirely. I read
in a veterinary manual that peritonitis may result from an impacted oviduct.
After I tried for about two weeks to remedy her situation, she died.
In isolated instances, I have had quail infected by pox via mosquitoes,
infected by Capillaria , and develop tumours. The Capillaria infection
was in most instances treated successfully with an anthelminic drug.
Whenever I have had a quail develop a bacterial infection, treatment with
various antibiotics has produced recovery. Whenever I have a sick quail,
initially, I place the bird in an isolated, comfortable setting, with a heat
source. I feed the bird an electrolyte solution to remedy dehydration and a
soya-based baby formula to increase calorific intake. Subsequently, I feed
the bird a peanut butter/commeal crumbled mixture which also has vitamin
and mineral supplements added. I have also found that small, whole, cooked
peas are an excellent dietary supplement.
I would like to conclude by mentioning my two male quail which would
be considered to have been elderly birds. A short time prior to its death,

one developed cataracts and therefore could no longer see its food. The
other ate only mealworms for the last two and a half months of its life. It
had stopped eating seeds and was losing weight, however, when I offered
mealworms, it chose these as its means of subsistence. Both males lived to
be about six years old. Neither was interested in crowing during the last
few months of their lives, despite being active, happy, little birds.
Chinese Painted Quail are some of the nicest birds to raise. Their
interesting behaviour and calls are a constant source of delight. Because of
their diminutive size, their health problems are not always easy to treat.
However, it is well worth the effort to keep and raise these wonderful little
birds.

THE RED-BROWED AMAZON PARROT EEP SCHEME
</sectionHeader>

The Red-browed Amazon Parrot Amazona rhodocorytha is endemic to
Brazil, where it is found in a narrow strip along the eastern coast. It is
found in the state of Alagoas and from Bahia and eastern Minas Gerias,
south locally to Rio de Janeiro. Its preferred habitat is generally lowland
humid forest, although it has also been recorded at altitudes of up to 1,000m
(3,280ft) in undisturbed forests. Most reports refer to this species being
located mainly in primary forest, with little sign that it can adapt to areas
which have suffered large scale disturbance.
The primary threat to its survival comes from long-term habitat
clearance. A trade in wild-caught birds existed in the past, but Brazilian
national legislation has now stopped any trade in the exportation of these
birds from Brazil. A local trade in nestlings for sale as pets has continued
in recent years but only in very small numbers and this is also being more
tightly controlled now. Probably the most clear need for in situ conservation
of this species is to secure the protection of some of the key regions of its
habitat. The most important region, Bahia, is protected now but other
parts of its range are still vulnerable to disturbance. The Red-browed
Amazon measures about 36cm (Min) in overall length and weighs about
450-480g, making it one of the largest Amazona species found in mainland
South America. The coloration of this species is particularly beautiful. As
with most Amazona species the main body plumage is green, with the most
striking feature being the lovely head coloration. The forehead and crown
are red, and the cheeks and throat are blue. Between the red of the forehead
and blue of the lower face is an area of yellow which covers the lores. The
extent of this yellow is highly variable, some birds have only a few yellow
feathers, while others have all the lores and the top of the cheeks completely
yellow. In our experience of a large number of these birds, the amount of
yellow varies from bird to bird and is not an indication of sexual dimorphism.
The Red-browed Amazon was only ever exported in small numbers
and has always been rare in aviculture. The captive population in Europe
is therefore based on only a small number of founder birds, which have
been in captivity for many years. Only a very small number of these have
reproduced during this long period of captivity. The small number of founder
birds which have bred, have done so consistently for several years, but
have produced a first generation population which is very closely related.
These first generation birds were sold by the main private keeper who was
breeding this species, often with little information about their exact
parentage. As these birds have passed from keeper to keeper, often a new

bird has been purchased in the belief that it is unrelated to its new owner's
other birds, when in fact the new bird is just as closely related as those
already in the new owner's possession. Indeed, most current first generation
pairings are of birds from the same parents. With the founder population
showing little breeding activity despite many years in captivity and with
only a few first generation birds being reared, in most cases, paired to a
clutch-mate, the future for this species in captivity was not very hopeful.
When the results of a survey of Amazon parrots in European zoos were
analysed to see which species were most important for captive population
management, the Red-browed Amazon was a clear choice. Loro Parque
was the obvious institution to coordinate an EEP (European Species
Survival) scheme for the Red-browed Amazon, because of the large number
held in the collection owned by the Loro Parque Foundation. A proposal to
form an EEP for the Red-browed Amazon was presented early in 1994 and
approved late in the summer of the same year. The first step was to identify
more clearly the captive population in Europe which could be included in a
managed population. All known holders of this species identified in the
European survey and also private keepers were sent studbook registration
forms and by early 1995, the first edition of the European regional studbook
was produced for the year ending 31st December 1994.
The first edition listed 71 Red-browed Amazons in collections willing
to allow their birds to be included in the EEP. Several more private keepers
also made initial contact but have proved slower to commit to full
membership of the EEP scheme. When reviewing the population, it was
clear that a great many founder birds were held in zoological collections
which had failed to breed them. Also, several collections held only single
birds which were important founders. Moving and pairing some of these
would prove to be difficult. Some were placed with zoos by national
authorities after they had been confiscated, and were therefore subject to
restrictions covering their movement to other countries. Also, as so few
were being bred, no collection had surplus birds, but rather wanted to add
to their collection, and nobody was willing to move a bird they already
held. If the EEP scheme was to succeed the most important thing was to
initiate breeding by previously unproductive founder birds.
The emphasis was again on Loro Parque, which at the time held 25 of
the population's birds, and also Palmitos Park, which held 12 birds. They
had to stimulate breeding by their birds. The other European collection
which held a substantial number, Walsrode, with 12 birds, had already
bred successfully from them in 1993 and 1994.
In the early months of the 1995 breeding season at Loro Parque we had
already taken the initiative and placed about 20 of our Red-browed Amazons,
those which showed least interest in courtship and breeding, into a large

communal flight cage. Along the back wall of this, nine breeding cages
adjoined each other: they measured 3m (9ft 9in) in length and had a nest-
box at the far end. Very close attention was paid to the behaviour of the
birds in this communal situation, even though we did this before the start
of the breeding season, to reduce to a minimum the chances of aggression.
Actual aggression was not a major problem, but we did note that two or
three birds seemed to be intimidated by these circumstances. After a few
days they had to be removed from the communal flight cage and were kept
separately and given mates later after the main pairing exercise had been
completed. Carefully, birds which showed pair-bonding behaviour were
separated from the group and the result was that in 1995, Loro Parque
recorded its first breeding success with the Red-browed Amazon, with five
chicks being reared to independence, from two different bloodlines. At the
time of writing this, in early July 1996, a further 13 chicks are being reared
at Loro Parque and we feel confident of increased success over the next few
years. Meanwhile, at Palmitos Park, a first time success was also recorded
in 1995, when a single chick was reared by foster-parents. This was
described by Rosemary Low in the Avicultural Magazine , Vo 1.102, No.2:
49-55. In June 1996, there were two chicks in the nest there.
In the two years since the Red-browed Amazon Parrot EEP scheme was
initiated and the European regional studbook formed, several formerly
unproductive founder birds in the population have started to breed. Over
30 Red-browed Amazon chicks have been bred successfully in 1995 and
1996 within the EEP population, 18 of these at Loro Parque. The growing
number of young being produced will increase the opportunities to move
and exchange birds to form unrelated pairs and, hopefully, bring all known
founder birds into a potential breeding situation.
The second edition of the European regional studbook will he produced
early in 1997. I strongly urge all those with Red-browed Amazons, who
have not already been in contact with me, to consider cooperating with the
EEP scheme. This will enable the population of first generation birds to be
paired to unrelated partners and the future of the European captive
population to become established. Given the uncertain prospects for this
species in the wild, an established and well-managed captive population
must be considered of great conservation value for the future.

Introduction
The Loro Parque Foundation (Loro Parque Fundacion (LPF)) is a non-
profit making, non-governmental organisation based at Loro Parque in
Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, from where it operates on an international
basis to promote the conservation of parrots, the environment and sustainable
development. A fundamental element of this is to encourage responsible
aviculture to realise its tremendous potential to contribute to conservation
of threatened species of parrots. As a member of the IUCN, the world
conservation union, the LPF adheres to consensus guidelines for the best
conservation outcomes for combined in-situ!ex-situ programmes. In
particular, the donation by Loro Parque of the world's largest and most
diverse parrot collection to the LPF has bestowed the latter with a heightened
responsibility to support in-situ conservation action. Thus, as a major donor
to field projects, the LPF now forms part of a growing movement among
zoological parks and within aviculture to help underpin the conservation
of species within their natural habitats, as recently summarised by Hutchins
and Conway (1995).
The LPF inherited the support provided to some long-term conservation
programmes from that given previously by Loro Parque, particularly in the
period 1987 to 1994, the year that the LPF was created. Given the specialised
interest of Loro Parque in the Psittacidae , the LPF has continued to focus
on conservation work that involves species within this family, especially
the more threatened forms. Thus the conservation and welfare needs for
parrots are dealt with by the LPF in accordance with what are accepted as
priority issues by the broader conservation community. Through Loro
Parque, the LPF participates in cooperatively managed captive breeding
programmes, for example being the coordinating entity for the Amazona
rhodocorytha and Ara glaucogularis EEPs (European Species Survival
schemes). Both of these involve zoological institutions and private breeders
who understand the conservation advantages to the species in question, as
well as the advantages to aviculture in general which can result from proper
management of captive populations. Where reservations have been
expressed (for example Beissinger and Snyder, 1992) about the current
viability of certain conservation options for parrots, in particular sustainable
harvesting and captive breeding, the LPF encourages aviculture to contribute
to the efforts to substantially improve the latter.

The LPF approach to conservation is intended to integrate the needs of
people and parrots, by encouraging local community initiatives which bring
permanent benefits through wise use of the local environment. The LPF
focuses on parrots because they are good indicators of the health of the
environment in which they occur and, because they are very noticeable,
charismatic birds, parrots can be very effective as 'flagships' (Dietz et al
1994) to attract more assistance to projects which integrate natural and
human rural communities with environmental safeguards and economic
improvements.

An essential part of the process in encouraging people to care for the
environment is to inform them of the benefits that will result. Using parrots
as environmental emblems, the LPF directly supports grassroots community
education programmes in countries where parrots occur. It also strongly
assists with the continuous development of the education programmes based
at Loro Parque, which use the animal collection as an educational resource.

Also based in the countries where parrots occur, the LPF finances
comprehensive field projects which produce the information for conservation
management and for local communities to use for improved land and natural
resource use. Ecological studies, parrot population monitoring,
reintroduction, protection measures and defining habitats for preservation
and extractive uses are all essential components of these projects.

<bodyText confidence="0.99084925" page_id="56261053"  page_num="110" year="" vol="">
In cases where parrot species have become seriously depleted in the
wild state, LPF organises and participates in coordinated programmes to
establish and maintain sufficient populations in captivity as a safeguard
against their extinction. Thus it incorporates the avicultural dimension,
while working to help parrots recover in the wild state.
ITaining and Research
Using the parrot collection at Loro Parque as a valuable resource, the
LPF provides excellent opportunities for dedicated people from around the
world to gain very effective experience in parrot care and conservation, as
well as for researchers to make discoveries which will assist this process.
Again, it utilises the wealth of information that the responsible avicultural
community can provide.

(International) Committee for the Recovery of the Spix's Macaw (CPRAA),

Halmaheran parrots, Indonesia
This island in the north Moluccas is home to no less than nine species
of parrot some of which, like the White Cockatoo Cacatua alba and
Chattering Lory Lorius garrulus, are globally threatened. The LPF has
funded a comprehensive species and habitat survey, implemented by Birdlife
International and the Indonesian Directorate General of Forest Conservation
and Nature Protection. By careful attention to the scarcity of some species
in forest on ultra-basic substrate, and the decline in bird densities above
700m (about 2,300ft) altitude, preliminary results form a strong case for
the gazetting of 350,000ha (about 865,000 acres) of prime habitat as a new
national park, and recent representations to the Indonesian Government
could, with the support of the World Bank, result in the establishment of
this protected area.

aviculture and the management of threatened parrot species in the wild,
particularly those with very small populations. The reintroduction of birds
from captivity to the wild is a problem issue until we have more knowledge
of cryptic diseases such as PDD. Currently there is no known way of
combating this disease which is spreading and becoming a global problem.
The disease has now been recognised as infectious, probably with a viral
causative agent, and no birds with confirmed PDD have survived. In the

The Bolivian NGO, Armonia, is funded by the LPF to census the
population of the highly threatened Ara glaucogularis, and develop
conservation management measures involving local people. The latest
reports from Armonia indicate an alarming situation with may be fewer
than 100 individuals remaining in the wild, while habitat destruction
continues and the illegal removal of young from the nests is a persistent
threat. With continuing support from the LPF, Armonia will increase its
positive working relations with local landowners to curb habitat loss and
improve protective measures. At the same time it will continue the census
work and to develop its educational programme for the local people of
Beni, the native region of this enigmatic species. With such a high profile
within aviculture, this is a species which responsible aviculturists can really
help in no small measure.

The range of projects illustrated shows that the LPF exists first and
foremost to help prevent the extinction of highly threatened parrots. It
works with highly motivated and well-organised people where the problems
need to be tackled, and links these with aviculturists who want to increase
their contribution to the conservation of the species that provide them with
so much enjoyment. The total of US$208,000 (approx. #140,000) support
to projects during 1996 can make a real difference, but these funds are
always hard-won and there is a constant search for ways to diversify our
sources of income.
Loro Parque is a constant supporter of the LPF, in particular with its
donation of the entire parrot collection of some 2,500 birds. As a way to
supply the demand for parrots from a captive-bred source rather than from
the wild, the breeding surplus from the parrot collection provides the LPF
with one means to secure income for direct in-situ conservation projects.
The LPF and Loro Parque carefully monitor sales of surplus birds to ensure
that direct use of the funds for in~situ conservation remains compatible
with cooperative breeding programme agreements and the welfare of all
birds. Thus, the LPF is moving ahead to make an effective contribution to
the conservation of parrots in the wild state, and to try to ensure that the
role of responsible aviculture in this regard can be enhanced.

The Chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax is a star! This is not just my
opinion but that of many other ornithologists, biologists, conservationists
and aviculturists, including the late Susan Cowdy (doyen of Bardsey Island
birds) who has recently been so tragically taken from us. I counted Susan
a friend - even though I had met her only twice, at Chough conferences.
She was one of the first and few conservationists to enthusiastically support
our efforts to re-establish the Chough in Cornwall, in south-west England,
partly through a captive breeding programme.
What follows is in part a summary of my PhD thesis - The Feeding
Ecology of the Red-hilled Chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax in West Wales
and the Feasibility of Re-establishment in Cornwall - written at Glasgow
University. I hope it might be useful to all those who are not prepared,
reasonably enough, to tackle the original 100,000 words!
The original massive and rapid decline of the Chough in Britain was
anthropogenic (begun by man). An east to west retraction had begun by
the 19th century; there is a good correlation between longitude and dates of
local extinctions. Persecution - direct and indirect - and a modernising
post-industrial Revolution agriculture, followed by rural depression
(resulting in ever less coastal grazing), profoundly damaged the long-term
survival of this always scarce and rather sedentary epigaeal invertebrate
feeder.
Why did it disappear from England and not from Wales, Scotland,
Ireland and Britanny on the French Atlantic coast? For a start, England
has no agrarian island refuges combining sympathetic farming practises
within a natural sanctuary. Islands provide the greatest length of multi-
aspected coastline relative to landmass. The next best is a heavily indented
remote coastline with abundant exposure aspects and headlands - such as
is found in Ireland.
I approached the ecological feasibility of re-establishing the Chough in
Cornwall from a dual perspective: 'What were the habitat factors which
caused Choughs to disappear from Cornwall and not Wales?' and 'Do any
significant differences still exist?'. In other words, could Cornwall support
a viable population today if Choughs were 'miraculously' to reappear? One
might ask the same question of Mauritius and the Dodo.
I spent a year assessing background habitats in west Wales and Cornwall
(in all 200 1km squares of coastal and inland habitat including Chough or

ex-Chough habitat but also a lot which was not and never had been Chough
habitat) field-by-field down to a resolution of a single pixel (20m sq),
measuring and recording in full detail any feature that represented 20% of
a pixel, including all botanical species, their distribution and height etc.
Other landscape features recorded and categorised were physical topography,
watercourses, hedges and boundaries. Historic change was examined via
the Tithe maps of the 1840s, which were compared (crude as they were) to
the present day mapping.
Essentially, the differences which were significant 150 years ago (as a
result of local remoteness and agricultural practices) no longer exist. Yet
West Wales is still able to support Choughs, albeit at a low level compared
to farther north. And of course Wales still also has its island sanctuaries
like Skomer, Ramsey and Bardsey.
So what do Choughs need? Although traditional extensive pastoral
agriculture - combining rough-grazing, permanent and maritime grassland
with arable elements in autumn and winter - is very important,
approximately three-quarters of feeding time being spent on the cliffs
(ranging from 57% at Cemaes, north Dyfed, to 94% in the south). Old/
permanent grassland (of which of course there used to be far more) forms a
transitional zone between the wild cliffs and modem agriculture. When
included as cliff complex, usage rises to 85%. In the south, where there is
very little if any old grassland, the proportion does not change, while at
Cemaes - with an 'upland' agriculture - 'cliff' usage increases to 20%.
I first assumed this was due to the quality of the adjacent agriculture:
i.e. more time was spent feeding on the 'better' farmland in the north.
However, when I investigated foraging success, I found that not only did
Choughs in the south spend more time feeding on the cliffs, they were also
more successful there (in terms of time and effort expended per food item
found) than on the 'good' agriculture farther north. This also correlates
with better reproductive success in the south.
This is only explained if it is not agriculture quality which governs
Chough habitat selection but cliff quality. To the south, the general aspect
of the cliff-line is south-west, compared to north-west in the north. The
exposure effect with a south-west aspect is greatly increased, with far less
cliff scmb, and further improved where grazed slopes roll down to low
vertical cliffs rather than where high rocky cliffs are thickly clothed by
scmb.
So, a high-quality cliffscape is top of the list - its presence will
compensate for a non-sympathetic agricultural hinterland. But where cliffs
are less suitable, the adjacent agriculture becomes crucially important, and

relies much on extensive farming combining heavy rough-grazing and
permanent pasture. 'Untidy' or eccentric farming (e.g. traditional farming)
is particularly valuable.
But I was interested in a much finer analysis of habitat than these broad
categories. For example, usage of bare earth was 28%. It is often said that
Choughs require short-grazed maritime grassland, and yet usage of this
habitat was only 5%. Short grass merely allows access to the substrate.
Nearby vegetation is of course necessary to provide food for the invertebrate
prey. The optimum habitat is pockets or zones of bare earth amongst a
healthy and diverse vegetation.
An excellent example of such is where human pathways cut through
natural vegetation on a cliff top. These are much used by Choughs in West
Wales which, like Cornwall, has quite heavy tourist traffic. So, by identifying
component structure, it is possible to enrich and finely tune habitats. And
it cannot be assumed for example that tourism is necessarily damaging -
something often claimed by opponents of Chough re-establishment. Human
usage of cliffs is heavy for only a very small proportion of the day, during
one brief season after breeding, and therefore, for very few hours of the
year. At other times, wildlife has exclusive use of these pathways.
By live sampling, faecal analysis and observation, study of the Chough's
diet revealed the year-round importance of beetles (in all their life stages)
and, to a lesser extent, tipulid 'leatherjackets', and a seasonal dependence
on other invertebrates, notably ants. As first suggested by Susan Cowdy,
ants are the major factor in nest-site selection. Although large numbers
are seen to be taken, their remains were never found in adult Chough faeces
when there were young in the nest, proving exclusive selection for feeding
to chicks - in the form of a bolus.
Another significant discovery was that earthworms and cereal grains
are interchangeable as a source of winter bulk protein: Choughs take one
or the other but rarely both. Cereal grain is probably preferentially selected
due to lower collection costs (it is gleaned off the ground surface) but if
unavailable, as in pastoral areas, earthworms are an important substitute.
In terms of prey-species diversity/abundancy, land-use, and, given that
sufficient habitat is available, I have few doubts that the Chough can be re-
established in its ancestral haunts along the Cornish cliffs. One can never
be sure of anything in life but providing no existing population is
endangered, re-establishing lost species is truly, to use the term used by the
NCC (Nature Conservancy Council) in its 1986 Corporate Plan, 'creative
conservation'. Certainly no harm can come of the attempt.

A healthy viable population of Choughs in Cornwall would be good for
Welsh Choughs and for the remnants surviving in Brittany for there would
undoubtedly be some genetic exchange - as confirmed by the vagrants
which still turn up in Cornwall (100km (62 miles) away across the Bristol
Channel; Brittany is roughly as far away again from Cornwall). It is asking
too much to expect enough Choughs from Wales to arrive in the same bit of
Cornwall at the same time, but it would be nice if, when Welsh or even
Irish wanderers did arrive in their English brotherland, they were greeted
by a Chough speaking in a totally foreign accent.
To this end, a breeding programme is now underway which has the
support of all registered keepers of Choughs in the UK. Like most corvids,
Choughs are not easy to breed successfully in captivity, they have a complex
social structure, varying from region to region. This needs to be understood
better and related to the captive situation. Rearing from captive produced
eggs is the only available option as a source of stock since it is not possible
at present for various reasons to use the wild surplus which exists in parts
of the Chough's very wide Palearctic range.
Providing Operation Chough can produce a viable founder population,
the broad plans for release have been worked out. We have identified suitable
sites in terms of quality and extent of habitat (historic nesting sites should
still exist) under sympathetic ownership. With goodwill on all sides,
Choughs can be re-established in England: the sort of goodwill displayed
by The Rare and Endangered Birds Breeding Centre at Paradise Park, Hayle,
Cornwall, when it offered to fund my research for three years.
It is still very unusual for 'zoos' to fund primary ecological fieldwork,
but it is essential to understand a species' ecological needs and their
availability before launching into a release programme. The vision shown
by Mike Reynolds (Director at Paradise Park) in sponsoring my research
should be applauded by all wildlife scientists who are seriously interested
in creative conservation.

The family of finches (Fringillidae) is a typical, species-rich, systematic
unit of Passerine singing birds, characterised by a special, well-developed
voice organ. The order Passeriformes comprises more than 5,100 species
of which the finches are generally described as 'seedeaters' in worldwide
ornithological and avicultural literature. These birds are considered one of
the dominant groups which came into existence in the Miocene Period,
about 20-30 million years ago, at a time when seed-forming plants were
developing.
Some species quickly colonised much of Europe including the Siskin
Carduelis spinus and Common Rosefinch Carpodacus erythrinus. Others
live only in Eurasia, e.g. the White-winged Grosbeak Mycerobas carnipes,
or within a small part of that territory, like the Japanese or Masked Hawfinch
Coccothraustes personatus.

The 'big' Grosbeak, actually the Caucasian Great Rosefinch C. rubicilla ,
is an Asian species which is available only rarely for our breeding
programmes. There is no information in avicultural literature about its
captive breeding. In the wild the species occupies a territory extending
from the Caucasus, via the central Asian mountains, to the Altai, Himalayas
and Tibet to eastern Nan-shan. It is a biotope occurring in the Alpine zone
up to the perpetual level of snow. In winter it descends to the cover of thick
vegetation. The nominate race C. r. rubicilla , is found only in the Caucasus.
Another race, C. r. kobdensis, lives in the Alpine zone of the central Altai.
Its plumage is red of approximately the same hue as the Caucasus race.
The least intensively coloured of the races is C. r. severtzovi. The colour of
the male's head, neck and breast is reddish-cinnamon, shading to a paler

pink on the back and tail. Light-coloured spots on the neck, head and breast
are larger than in other races.
After the autumn change of 'overcoat', birds are deeper and richer in
colour. In the spring the hue becomes lighter and more intense. In captivity
Carpodacus species lose their intense crimson-red colouring very quickly,
because the intensity of that colouring depends on consumption of the green
parts of plants, as well as unripe fruits which contain a great amount of red
pigments. Carotene, an artificial red colouring, is given to some species of
Carpodacus (e.g. the Mexican House Finch C. mexicanus ) which are bred
more frequently in countries where breeding programmes have been
established.
The grey and brown shades dominate the entire plumage; there are
oval silver spots on the head, neck and breast. The lower part of the body
is grey-white, and the wings and wing-coverts are grey-brown. The female
is grey-brown with a slight pink tinge which usually disappears in captivity.
Juvenile males have similar colouring until the first autumn moult.
I purchased a pair of C. r. severtzovi three years ago. The birds came
from Kazakhstan. They do not nest there, only wintering in this locality -
especially in the vicinity of Alma-Ata and the Aksu-Dchabagli reservation
(Kovsar, 1988). According to their hue it was possible to establish that
they belonged to the central Asian form of severtzovi. The birds were very
shy and remained in the rear of the aviary which was covered in and sheltered
from behind and both sides. The dimensions of the aviary were
4m x lm x 2m high (13ft x 3ft 3in x 6ft 6in high). It was thickly overgrown
with wild raspberry bushes and young maple saplings. Sunflower seeds
and husked oats were the basic components of their diet. However, the
birds pecked at the green parts of plants and bushes so that all vegetation
was totally devastated during that summer. Of all the Asiatic species I
have ever bred, these birds fed mostly on green vegetation and they destroyed
plants as quickly as lovebirds do.
In addition to the sunflower seeds and husked oats, I also used to feed
them on hemp and flax seeds for which they had keen appetites. Rape seed,
millet and unhusked oats were eaten in small quantities. Every day they
were supplied with an egg food enriched with various multi-vitamins and
minerals. Once accustomed to this mixture they consumed it regularly and
I believe it helped maintain the birds in good condition throughout the
year. Whortleberries were a favourite item of food which 1 provided fresh,
frozen and dried - I soaked them in water for 12 hours before feeding.
Despite sufficient quantities of fresh and green foods, the male lost its deep
red-crimson colouring very quickly (within three to four months). During
the second year it got a slight red and pink tinge on its head and breast.
It is clear that these Alpine birds can be wintered in an outdoor aviary
with an area at the back covered as described. Food is provided in this
area. On the other hand, it was clear they did not like the hot seasons,

during which time they sheltered from the sun in thick, low-growing
vegetation. During summer an outbreak of scabies was diagnosed; it was
caused by Cnemidocoptes mites.
Only the Alpine and Siberian birds were disease-ridden. In addition to
the Caucasian Great Rosefinch, only the White-winged Grosbeak and
Pallas's Rosefinch C. roseus were affected. Hypothetically, we have to take
into account several initiating factors. One may be the fact that Alpine and
Siberian species are less resistant to some diseases because they do not
occur in the climate zone of their country of origin. If they are bred in
captivity under warmer conditions, common infections would cause serious
health problems due to their weak immunity. In addition, the Alpine and
Siberian air is cleaner and does not harbour as many infectious particulates
as that in milder zones.

At the end of March the male began to sing from a high vantage point
in the aviary. A quiet, melodious chatter was interspersed with short
whistles. In spite of the fact that the birds were in good condition for
breeding, they did not mate, nor did they build a nest during two breeding
seasons. At the end of the second summer the female fell ill with scabies.
After medication with Skabicid the disease did not occur clinically. However,
the entire body was probably affected because the bird continued to languish
up to total cachexia. The male died a year later with similar symptoms
after repeated treatment with Skabicid, Neguvon and Tylan.
The breeding of C. r. severtzovi in captivity has not been researched
yet. Only a few individual birds have ever been imported and therefore
their reproduction in captivity must be extremely rare. We expect better
contacts with breeders in the countries of origin of this race in the future
and hope this may lead to more frequent importations of these birds.

These notes are about the birds and plants (and some other creatures)
in our large garden in Durban, Natal, South Africa. Our lasting impression
of Durban was of the year-round plethora of flowering shrubs and trees and
these contributed in no small way to the variety of birds and butterflies on
the property. The limiting factor to the plant life, and therefore to some
extent the bird life, was salt spray, for we were just a short distance from
the beach.
The property was situated at the highest point of a seaside ridge and the
tallest things visible from downtown, were our two large Norfolk Island
Pines Araucaria heterophylla. To the front was the sea, while the back
overlooked a small valley. When the Brazilian Tibouchina was flowering,
the sea of purple and pink which covered the far slope of the valley created
an unforgettable view. At the bottom of the valley was a wild, bush-covered
park. Later, a golf course was built on half of it but it remained ecologically
friendly.
The lot was enclosed at the front and back by walls, bordered with
Hydrangeas on the street, or seaside, and by a line of heavily-berried Pepper
Trees Schinus molle on the inland side. Both ends were demarcated by a
thick Brazilian Cherry Eugenia uniflora hedge. Half of the area was left
completely uncultivated, with paths mowed through the long grass. The
front bore the brunt of the salt-laden, southerly gales, but the downhill side
at the back was more sheltered, creating several distinct micro-climatic
areas.
Numerous trees, included the aforementioned Norfolk Island Pines, date
palms - with fruits edible only to birds - mulberries, guavas, papayas
(pawpaws), two very large flame of the forest Erythrina spp. and an 18ft
(5. 5m) Ficus elastica - the potted Rubber Plant of more miserable climes.
There were also several wild or accidental trees, such as the 'lucky bean'
with its decorative but poisonous black and red seeds, as well as a fair-
sized strangler fig. A Natal Plum Carissa grandiflora provided tasty fruit
as well as an impenetrable thorny haven for nesting birds.
Flowering shrubs and plants abounded. Notable were large coastal aloes,
said to grow only within the salt spray, a clump of giant Strelitzia and thick
stands of ginger with very tropical-looking flowers. Frangipanis Plumeria,
Oleanders and 10ft (3m) Poinsettias added further colour and there were
numerous vines, including edible passion fruit. Banana plants were liberally
sprinkled around but their roots were invariably eaten through by Mole

Rats, causing the plants to crash over if anyone leaned against them. All
these, yet the salt spray limited the number of species which could be grown
there!
On moving in, the first birds we saw were the human-tolerant residents.
The most obvious was a pair of Indian Mynas Acridotheres tristis. These
are a widespread introduced nuisance, just as they are in Hawaii. They also
have a foothold on Madagascar and are found on other islands between
Africa and India, They did, however, keep sparrows away from the garden.
The mynas came down, along with a few other birds, every time bread was
put out, which was quite often, as we found it coarse and barely palatable
because it contained a high percentage of maize flour.
The male myna was easily recognised on account of its noticeably darker
head and bigger wattles. The pair foraged solely in the garden and included
in their territory the strip of Hydrangeas between the wall and the roadway.
They nested in a hole above an upstairs window of the stone-built house
and usually raised two broods a year. Although they laid four or five eggs,
they seldom succeeded in raising all of the chicks to maturity. Often, one
of the brood would be limping because of rickets and during one particularly
dry year, only a solitary chick survived. Because of the relentless drought
(we arrived midway through a ten year one) insects were not always plentiful
so, in spite of objections on ecological grounds, we fed the adults on bread
every day one season and they produced four broods and a total of 15 young
fledged.
Every summer the newspapers contained stories of 'vicious' mynas dive-
bombing children who passed too close to the nest - just as they published
tales of 'vicious' Vervet Monkeys threatening players on the local golf
course.
The mynas earned our grudging admiration as they swaggered around
in charge of their territory and chased away larger doves. Our back door
was always left open, and they became so bold that they took to coming in
to raid the dog's dish and sometimes flew right into the kitchen. We went
off them when, on one of these kitchen forays, on the way out they snatched
up our daughter's pet Dwarf Chameleon and fed it to their chicks. A Death's
Head Hawkmoth, a bat with a 1ft (30cm) wingspan and snakes were among
other creatures which came in through the back door.
Other obvious garden residents were the doves. Every morning we
were awakened by the pleasant 'cooing' of a pair of doves calling from
their warming perch in the Rubber Tree. In the summer, this unfortunately
meant a 4.15am reveille, for no one in South Africa had the wit to introduce
daylight saving time. The doves were among the five species that vied for
the bread hand-outs and they all became relatively tamer so much so that
the dog, whose hobby was chasing things, often came close to catching
them.

Two pairs of the large Red-eyed Doves Streptopelia semitorquata nested
in the heavily-spiked date palms at opposite ends of the garden. When
coming and going from the nest, they made a 'meow' so like that of a cat,
that it was a long time before we found that it emanated from the doves. In
the breeding season, the males developed a powder blue patch on the back
of the head and neck, one bird being particularly brightly marked.
A pair of the smaller Laughing Doves S. senegalensis held the ground
between the two pairs of Red-eyed Doves. They all bred at any time of the
year but especially during the winter. Both species built only in spiky
plants, S. senegalensis using thorny Bougainvillea , sparsely-spined lemon
or the unassailable Natal Plum. The nests were the usual flimsy collection
of twigs, yet unlike some others, they were never blown down. On these
rimless platforms, the plump squabs were sitting targets for Boomslangs,
the local highly poisonous tree snakes, the males of which are green and
the females brown.
Although normally vegetarian, both species of doves ate 'white ants'
(termites). The opportunity to do so arose four or five times a year, during
the amazing termite irruptions. In spite of the tirelessly repeated statement
that these insects only swarm after rain, the local termites did so day or
night, without regard to the weather or season. In areas of perhaps half a
square mile (1.30km sq), millions would simultaneously emerge from the
ground. When this happened during the day, birds and lizards threw caution
to the wind and settled on roadways to gorge themselves on them, and the
doves were always present at these feasts. As cars were usually unable to
pass by while the termites were flying, the roadway diners were never in
too much danger. When the swarms emerged and flew round the street
lamps in the evenings, large bats replaced the birds and big toads took the
place of the lizards. One night thousands of termites came up inside the
aviary and the birds ate so many that they could barely get off the ground
for the next week. The termite swarms are a boon to aviculturists, for a
bucket can be filled in a minute or so, and the contents frozen and used
later.
More retiring, but seen at feeding time, was the resident pair of Black-
eyed Bulbuls Pycnonotus harbatus. One always kept watch while the other
hopped clumsily on its short legs to the food hand-out. When they were
not feeding on bread crumbs, they could be seen gorging themselves on the
little dates, with the improbably large stones. Or, they could be seen
desperately trying, unsuccessfully, to swallow the Brazilian cherries, which
were too large for them to swallow whole, or eating large numbers of unripe,
spiny Castor Oil Ricinus communis berries, blissfully unaware of castor
oil's reputation! Bulbuls were the only birds to eat these.
The Black-eyed Bulbuls usually raised their brood of two chicks in the
Pepper Trees, probably because the small red berries were a convenient

source of food, as were the Lantana berries below. The broods were always
successful, save for the odd loss to a tree snake. The old nests of not very
securely anchored fine grasses, were always blown out of the trees when
the gales came. This bulbul has a rather miserable, limited call of three or
four notes.
The fifth species to come for the bread was that accursed, cosmopolitan
nest-pirate, the common House Sparrow Passer domesticus - enough said!
The above were year-round residents, whereas a number of others came
to nest in the garden, some doing so regularly. Prominent among the latter
was a pair of weavers, either Ploceus velatus or P. cucullatus, which in
spite of usually being colonial nesters, returned every year to nest by
themselves in the same palm by the kitchen door. This triple-trunked tree
with wicked 4in (10cm) spines, was shared with one of the pairs of Red-
eyed Doves. Many of the palm fronds collapsed while still green and had
obviously been eaten through. One day, when standing beside the tree, we
heard chewing sounds and on digging into the stem with a screwdriver,
found a number of huge Rhinoceros Beetles.
The male weaver always built several nests and slept in one of them. A
more substantial nest was made for raising a family, one with a 6in (15cm)
long, loosely woven, downward pointing tube, with the nest chamber at the
top. Construction was of fine, 12-18in (30-46cm) long strips, neatly peeled
from the edge of a palm leaf and hung from the tip of a frond by a few
knotted strands. The nest chamber was lined with down and grasses but
the tube was unlined. All the nests lasted until the fronds fell (which they
did annually) and until this happened, it looked as if there was a small
colony of weavers present.
The kitchen was on the first floor at the back of the house, on a level
with the top of the palm, and the birds could be seen entering the nest.
This was done by flying quite fast towards it, then turning upwards. At the
last split second, the wings were folded and the feet drawn up, and the
momentum usually carried the bird to the top of the tube.
When displaying to his mate, the black and yellow male hung upside
down beneath a nest and flapped his wings. Apart from a buzzing call at
this time, the pair was quiet, in great contrast to the very noisy weaver
colonies in the area. After breeding, the male lost his black and yellow
plumage and the pair hung about with some companions, but were never
away from the garden for long.
In the late winter or early spring (there was not much difference between
the two) the leafless Erythrina trees burst into flower. Their spectacular
large scarlet blossoms attracted many birds which gathered to partake of
the nectar. There were the bulbuls and, rather surprisingly, also the mynas
and occasionally the doves. The most regular feeders were the sunbirds -
and the weavers!

The garden was the centre of the very large territory needed to provide
fruit for a family of six to ten Speckled Mousebirds Colius striatus. They
were plain, dull brown, with no speckling. The much-repeated suggestion
that the name mousebird comes from the fact that these birds 'creep around
like mice' is, in my opinion, ludicrous, for neither of these creatures creep.
There was an annual race between us and the birds to harvest the
exquisite Natal plums. Every day they would peck a test hole to check if a
fruit was ripe, so usually we had to content ourselves with half-eaten, though
still delicious fruits. The birds also competed with Vervet Monkeys for
bananas, guavas and papayas. While the monkeys struggled unsuccessfully
to carry off large ripe papayas, throwing sprigs to distract our enraged
dogs, the mousebirds sat calmly on the fruits, in all sorts of gymnastic
positions and gorged themselves. The monkeys always came back later to
carry away the papayas once the birds had reduced them to more manageable
sizes.
The mousebirds also ate the Pepper Tree berries but never ate anything
very hard, unless one includes the dates, which they swallowed whole,
stones and all. They ignored the cherry tomatoes which grew in wild
profusion, leaving the monkeys to make off with the unwanted produce.
The Brazilian cherry (which has no connection with our northern cherries)
has an astringent quality and, like the Natal plum, can be eaten only when
it is fully ripe. It is an acquired taste to which we became addicted. This
fruit also appealed to the mousebirds which ate large quantities of it. As a
single small tree held about 6,000 cherries though, the loss was not
noticeable. Another favourite was the Lantana berry. This introduced pest
ran riot on every piece of unused ground and a large patch grew just over
the back wall and provided a bonanza for many birds. As the greater part
of the mousebird's diet was made up of introduced plants, we wondered
what they used to eat before these were brought to South Africa. When
fruit was out of season, a year-round staple was papaya leaves. In captivity,
mousebirds in Canada ate large quantities of Weigela leaves. When we
tasted papaya leaves, we found that they have an awful, bitter taster just
like the Weigela.
The habits of the wild Speckled Mousebird are virtually identical to
those noted for the Blue-naped Mousebird C. macrourus living in aviaries.
Like the latter, they are silent, save for an alarm call. Sand-bathers, they
were only once seen to make use of water. After some flowers were watered,
they spread their wings and wiggled about on the wet flowers and leaves.
Oddly, this behaviour was also recorded only once in the aviary.
The Speckled Mousebirds nested in the Natal Plum and sometimes in
the 'cherry' hedge or the Pepper Trees, where their ten day incubation
period did not prevent predation by Boomslangs. No doubt tree snakes had

an influence in the development of this short incubation period, just as
their presence must have pressured mousebird chicks to leave the nest well
before fledging and clamber about among the foliage. The mousebirds,
along with the Laughing Doves, seemed to suffer most from predation by
Boomslangs. Though this may simply have been because their nests could
easily be seen from the kitchen windows and their predation was therefore
more easily witnessed. These pencibslim reptiles could glide through the
hedge with remarkable speed and grace and though thorns did not seem to
bother them, the nests in the spiky Natal Plum bush were less troubled than
others. The mousebird chicks' habit of leaving the nest prematurely, meant
that they often had to be rescued, and it was not uncommon for Speckled
Mousebirds to be kept as pets.
The dull, greenish-grey Cape White-eyes Zosterops pallidus were near-
permanent residents. A pair always nested among the lower branches of
one of the Norfolk Island Pines. Like the mousebirds (and as noted in the
aviary), the chicks invariably left the nest several days before they could
fly. This often resulted in them being caught and kept by children as 'pets'.
However, unlike the frugivorous mousebird chicks, the insectivorous
Zosterops chicks soon died.
When, during the breeding season, a path was being cut in the grass
below the pines, the parents' alarmed whistles caused the landscape to
explode with chicks fluttering in the air, then disappearing out of sight
again, at which point the mowing was stopped. The white-eyes sometimes
pecked small holes in the fruit to sup the juice but could scarcely penetrate
deep enough to do any real harm and preferred to feed where the fruit had
already been damaged by the Colius. Otherwise, they ate quantities of
Lantana berries and, of course, insects. Their flimsy, cobweb-bound nests
were always the first to be blown out of the trees.
Incorporating our grounds in its large territory was the Black-collared
Barbet Lybius torquatus. The dual calling of these attractive red-faced
barbets is a well-known sound. The loud call is started by the male and
finished by the female. However, we are sure we heard a single male,
which had lost its mate, make both calls - perhaps the only time this has
been noted! They always called from a concealed position and stopped if
they thought they were being watched. They use a most unbirdlike little
growl to communicate at close quarters. Their saw-toothed bill is used like
a can-opener to tackle tough fruit rind etc.
Nest-boxes were put up all over the place, but the only occupants ever
seen were an occasional surprised little snake and geckoes. Ignoring the
boxes like the rest of the birds, the Black-collared Barbets enlarged a rotten
area in a small avocado tree. It never fruited because of the salt-laden air,
while others produced fruit just a short distance inland. The entrance tunnel
to the nest was l 3 Ain (4.5cm) in diameter and l 3 Ain (4.5cm) long. Half of

this length projected as a lip above the chamber, which was pouch-shaped,
814in (21cm) deep below the lip, with an average width of 3 1 Ain (8cm).
The width was governed by the fact that the nest was in a limb barely 4Wn
(11cm) across. The nest chamber came to a rather abrupt, natural point,
filled to a depth of lin (2.5cm) with rotten wood dust. Three white eggs
were laid and the chicks were fed mostly on large insects, gathered from
the foliage of nearby trees by the parents, who hunted together and kept in
constant contact with each other. These shy birds were never seen to forage
on the ground and they never left or entered the nest if they suspected
anyone was in the vicinity.
Occasional Nesters
One summer, the drought broke, though only temporarily, as usual.
The grass immediately sprouted and reached 3ft (92cm) tall and there was
a heavy crop of seeds. There was a corresponding influx of seedeaters into
the area, one of which was the Common Waxbill Estrilda astrild. This
little bird built in the grass at the foot of a small guava tree, in the unmown
part of the garden. The grapefruit-sized, tightly constructed nest had a
complex, closed entrance of interlocking grass stems. This was situated at
the top and resembled the tuft of fibre on the end of a coconut. If disturbed,
the female exploded out through this, pushing the stems apart as she went.
They immediately closed behind her and it was a mystery how she managed
to get back in, for the stems would not part, unless pulled open.
On the side of the nest, near the top, was a little opening, leading to a
tiny chamber - a so-called cock's nest. But the male was never seen in this,
no matter how often it was examined, in fact, the male was never seen at
all. The entrance to the main nest could even have been via this side
chamber, through a reverse grass-lock. The complicated entrance was likely
an anti-snake strategy, with the dead-end side entrance perhaps a further
attempt to frustrate these reptiles.
The six eggs all hatched and the chicks soon filled their private little
nest chamber until eventually only two would be uppermost at any given
time. Maybe at this stage the female slept in the annex. Anyway, the
system worked, for none of the chicks were smothered and all fledged
successfully.
Several species of sunbirds were frequent visitors, especially to the
winter-flowering, long-tubed, red aloe flowers. Juvenile sunbirds spent all
winter in the garden. Most days, one of these streaked, greenish birds
could be seen hunting assiduously for spiders along the lower branches of
a Norfolk Island Pine. They proved impossible to identify and always
disappeared before getting their adult colouring.

As spring approached, the young males began to make courtship flights.
They rose from a pine branch and with their beaks pointing skyward,
spiralled up for ten to 15ft (3m-4.6m), before stalling and returning to the
same perch. We were never sure whether this was just for practise, or if
one of the watching, identically garbed birds was a female.
Once only, a Black (or Amethyst) Sunbird Nectarinia amethystina came
to nest. It made three attempts to hang its pendulous home from the bottom
branch of one of the Araucarias. The unpredictable southerly gales - up to
90mph (145 km per hour) on occasions - were the reason for sunbirds not
breeding in the garden, for their hanging nests needed a sheltered
environment. Three times the nest was blown down, before the bird 'wised-
up' and built it at the back of the aviary.
The 1 Sin (46cm) long structure hung by only two or three slender grasses
which were interwoven with others to hold the tiny globule nest, suspended
1ft (30cm) below. The delicate little nest chamber was made from plant
down, bound with cobwebs. It had a side entrance with the merest entrance
platform and tiny awning. Grasses hung underneath and tapered off in a
mirror image of the top. The whole structure swayed wildly in the slightest
breeze but the female remained unperturbed and continued to sit tight.
The intricate nest was only 5ft (1.5m) above the ground but the female
refused to be flushed, so that the proceedings could be monitored more
easily. The two white eggs soon produced two chicks. These were fed on
very small soft-bodied insects, mostly spiders, and nectar. The female, a
single parent, endlessly brought food, regardless of our presence and the
young fledged without trouble.
The Lantana, although over the back wall, was still on our property.
The ground fell away steeply there so the wall was built on the top of the
bank, rather than on the property line at the foot. This sheltered bank was
covered with rocks as an anti-erosion measure and was consequently home
to skinks, geckoes, snakes and small birds.
A neat globular nest appeared one day, only 1ft 6in (46cm) up in the
Lantana tangle, below the Pepper Trees. The outside was made of fresh
leaves and it blended in well with the weeds and creepers. A small entrance
was situated near the top, unfortunately facing downhill, which meant it
could not be observed easily. So well camouflaged was it that it was a
wonder that it could be seen at all. The builder proved to be a Tawny-
flanked Prinia Prinia subflava. This long-tailed, greenish yellow, warbler-
like bird has a wide distribution stretching from Africa to south-east Asia.
It is very secretive and its rapid, loud 'buzz' was often heard while it
remained unseen. Because of this and the inaccessibility of the nest, nothing
further was noted other than the fact that the chicks, in spite of living
immediately below a tree snake route, were safe in the enclosed nest and
all got away.

The non-nesting species could be divided into local and seasonal
residents and rare visitors. Every winter, a holiday-making pair of Fork-
tailed Drongos Dicrurus adsimilis showed up. These handsome,
streamlined, jet black birds entertained us with their flying displays. They
would soar to a great height, then come rushing downwards in a steep dive,
only to pull out just before hitting the ground. These air show aerobatics
were not just confined to the breeding season as sometimes thought - the
birds performed them out of joie-de-vivre. The 'FI6s' of the bird world,
they were such confident fliers that they chased crows for fun, striking
these considerably larger birds on their heads and backs, until the marauders
took the hint and left the area.
The attraction was our beehive which the drongos perched above and
picked-off 12-15 incoming bees per meal. It is likely that the drongos knew
that homing bees carried honey. That these were 'African killer bees' did
not bother them and the number they took made no discernible dent in the
6,000-7,000 strong hive. The bees were wonderful honey producers, which
continued to work during rain showers, moderate winds and even on glorious
moonlit African nights. However, they had disconcerting habits - noises
annoyed them, as did just about everything else. Anything black drove
these belligerent little insects into a fury. Our black Doberman cross bitch
soon learned to avoid the area around the hive altogether after she had
been pursued into the house, yelping and covered with angry bees, while
our fawn Bullmastiff was ignored.
Not only were the drongos the sole exception to their colour prejudice
but they managed to instil a fear into the occupants of the hive which
nothing else could. When they were hunting, the hive was quiescent. The
bees inside would not fly out, while those which were out tried to sneak
back as unobtrusively as possible, with many electing to sit quietly on nearby
vegetation, waiting for the danger to pass. How the bees knew about the
drongos was a mystery and if anyone needs a subject for a doctoral thesis,
here it is.
Every winter, bee-eaters turned-up in the local park. Each would sit on
an exposed branch overlooking open ground where it could see, pursue
and capture its prey, then glide effortlessly back to knock the insect senseless
on the same perch from which the bird had taken off. It was amazing the
distance at which hapless flying insects were spotted and the pursuit never
failed. Occasionally, a Little Bee-eater Merops pusillus - a winged 'work

back wall. After a quick snack it would leave, for in spite of the bees, the
area was not open enough for it.
A lone male Natal Robin (or Red-capped Robin-Chat) Cossypha
natalensis arrived every winter, and was almost certainly always the same
bird. As is often the case, its subdued but matching attire of slaty blue and

burnt orange was more attractive than a gaudy jumble of clashing colours.
Its seasonal arrival was odd, for resident Natal Robins lived in a patch of
woods just over a mile (IV 2 km) away, so it probably came from inland. C.
natalensis always delivers its excellent song from thick cover. It is a
contender for the title of our favourite African species, as we like robins/
thrushes because of their singing ability and general manner, and it was
the only one of the robins ever to visit us.
The last of the winter birds was a once-only (Red-shouldered) Glossy
Starling Lamprotornis nitens. This is one of the very few birds which we
saw in our garden that was already familiar to us before we arrived in
Africa. Not from the immediate area, this species became increasingly
common SOmiles (80km) inland in the dry uplands. A typical starling in
habits, with eyes the colour of old piano keys, this one spent two days
poking around a cavity in a big flame of the forest tree. Finding the hole
already occupied by a bush baby, it soon moved on. A Klaas's Cuckoo
Chrysococcyx klaas with a heavily barred white front and with a green
back with orange spots, stopped by in the summer, but never called, foraged,
or showed up with a mate.
A pair of Yellow-billed or Black Kites Milvus mi grans patrolled the
valley each summer. Several times a week one of them sailed serenely over
the property on motionless wings, steering delicately with its long forked
tail. It never landed and did not even slow down to examine the carrion
left to tempt it, so what it ate remained a mystery to us. Small birds were
never troubled by its presence.
A conspicuous Brown-hooded Kingfisher Halcyon albiventris often
came to hunt, sitting every time on the same exposed branch of a pine,
from where it sallied forth to catch skinks and geckoes. This dingy-looking,
lOin (25.5cm) long species, like all kingfishers, seemed much bigger because
of its huge head and bill. It is often found far from water and lives on
reptiles, locusts and other such prey.
On a nearby house lot, a bulldozer cut away part of a bank to level the
site and left a sandy, vertical face and, within two days, two pairs of Sin
(13cm) long Malachite Kingfishers Alcedo cristata began to tunnel into it.
Although there was a small stream in the park with hundreds of released
guppies, the two pairs did nearly all of their hunting in adjacent gardens.
This species is normally very retiring and keeps to dark, thick cover, Peering
into our dense Natal Silverleaf bush, the only indication of the bird's presence
was the flash of its coral-red bill - about two-fifths the length of the body
- as it disappeared.
Yet another consumer of lizards (it was tough being a lizard on our
property) was the handsome, white-breasted, black-backed Fiscal Shrike
Lanius collaris, so-called because magistrates wore white shirts and black

cloaks. The male shrike would sit on the gable of the house and whistle its
loud, pleasant song for 20 minutes at a time. Never shy, it came down
while we sat in the garden and, using its heavy, wickedly-hooked bill,
snatched-up skinks and grasshoppers. Oddly, in spite of the fact that it was
with us most of the time, we never saw a mate. Perhaps it nested in a
nearby garden.
Even shyer and more unobtrusive than the Black-collared Barbet was
the Red-fronted Tinker Barbet (or Tinkerbird) Pogoniulus pusillus.
Commonly heard but rarely seen, and then only as a flash of yellow among
the high branches, the persistent 'tonk, tonk' of this bird was one of the
sounds of the summer. This wary black and yellow bird (with a red forehead)
merged with the sun-dappled foliage and could easily have nested in or
around the property without being spotted.
Once, at the far end of the garden, a little bleat was heard coming from
a dense bush. It sounded all the world like a goat kid, but investigation
proved the maker of the sound to be a bird. It was some time before we
knew that the Bleating Warbler Camaroptera brachyura was there at all.
This drab little bird, cocked its short tail like a wren and was so shy we
never saw it outside of its beloved bushes.
The largest species to actually land in the garden was the Hadeda Ibis
Bostrychia hagedash. Its long, curved, red-lined bill was just right for
probing, backwards between its legs, down the sloping cricket burrows.
They were about half the length of the ibis's bill and the heavy, slow-moving
crickets were easily extracted. All facing the same direction like sheep, the
ibis would move forward in a tight group, scouring the ground for the
crickets. The Hadeda has adapted well to the intrusion of people and forages
on open ground, such as sports fields, in the suburbs. They remain extremely
wary though, and if watched for too long, even from a distance, will take
off, uttering their harsh cries as they do so. These woodland ibis roosted in
the nearby park where they were always being disturbed in the middle of
the night, probably by a mongoose. The Hadeda (with the accent on the
'ha') is one of the few birds to clearly utter its name and we would be
awakened by their raucous cries 'ha ha, ha dee da', followed by a few
sleepy 'ha ha's', as the birds settled again.
All our small birds were thrown into a panic by crows, unless that is the
drongos were present. We were occasionally visited by the Pied Crow Corvus
albus. Black, with a white collar and breast, it seemed to be an accident
prone species, for about 15 could be seen at any one time at the local Center
for the Rescue of Wildlife (CROW). Maybe because they are so big (20in
(50cm) long), they are found more easily. One such bird, with an irreparably
broken wing, was given to us by a well-meaning worker at the center. We
took it reluctantly and set it on a hurriedly constructed feeding platform in

a lucky bean tree. The bird remained both wary und belligerent, ungratefully
stabbing the hand that fed it, and its incessant 'cawing' had a depressing
effect on the surrounding birdlife. After a week, this constant uproar
attracted two other Pied Crows which 'cawed' encouragingly enough for
the invalid to leap from the tree and hedge-hop away. By the time it was
traced the following day, the kindly lady in whose garden it had stopped
had already rushed off with it to CROW. Nobody at the center recognised
the former inmate and, needless to say, we never said a word.
One Sunday morning we were awakened by a haunting call of seven or
eight loud, slow, deliberate notes, delivered on a descending scale and
repeated over and over again. Looking out of the window, we beheld a
magical sight. The whole valley was blanketed by a white mist. Only the
garden was free of mist and the house had become a lonely ship on a
becalmed sea. The sole sound that eerily quiet morning was made by a
'rain bird', aptly named because it becomes vocal after rain. The latter was
so infrequent that we had never heard the bird before, although it had been
spotted once in the park. The mist had given it the courage to leave its
familiar dense cover and travel round the gardens. Burchell's Coucal
Centropus superciliosus, to give it its more prosaic name, suddenly appeared
from over the wall and began to toy with a piece of paper. This gave us a
rare chance to observe this evasive bird, which measures 17V^in (44cm)
and has a white throat, rufous back, barred rump, long tail and, above all,
a heavy, curved bill and fiery red eyes, contriving to make it look like a
cross between a hawk and a pheasant. When it tired of playing with the
paper, it slipped silently into the mist and was neither heard nor seen again.
Our last local bird, but one which passed so high overhead that it barely
qualified, was the White Pelican Pelecanus onocrotalus. A small colony
lived on a large pond about two miles (3km) away. Nearly every day, a
flock of six to eight flew by on their way to fish in an estuary about 25 miles
(40km) up the coast. In spite of looking top-heavy with a bill half the
length of their body, these pelicans were wonderfully elegant in the air.
Pet birds
Birds in this category were surprisingly common, with the easy living
in the area contributing to their survival. The calling of a neighbour's
Cockatiels attracted a multitude of others of every imaginable mutation.
Where were they coming from? About three miles (5km) away there was a
vegetable oil factory. There they pressed peanuts for the oil and left a huge
pile of crushed nuts lying outside. This attracted hordes of pigeons and
anything between 20 and 40 Cockatiels each day, along with other birds,
including a few parrots. In spite of such large numbers, there were never
any reports of Cockatiels nesting in the wild. Probably their commercial

value meant that they did not remain free for long enough. Once we found
a young boy hanging precariously some 12-13ft (3.7~4m) up in a Norfolk
Island Pine, with a white Cockatiel keeping one branch ahead of him.
Two African Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus showed up at different
times, each spending two days in the garden. Both were very wary and sat
on top of a baited cage but refused to enter it - one of them shouted abuse at
us in Afrikaans. They were remarkably fit and took off flying high, fast
and direct. We had more luck catching Budgerigars. These trusting birds
invariably entered cages, or sat on our hand. They were not strong fliers
and never travelled very far. Usually they were claimed by distraught little
girls. Much stronger on the wing were the Peach-faced Lovebirds Agapomis
roseicollis. Nearly all of them were fairly tame yet nobody ever claimed
them, probably because they flew fast and far. The result was that we often
had a colony of up to six living in the big Erythrina tree, with some leaving
only to be replaced by newcomers. This species, called the Rosy-faced
Lovebird in South Africa, is found wild in Namibia, on the other side of
the continent.
Our own pet bird was a broody Silky hen. Just two weeks after we got
it, the bird was found to be crawling with mites. These were quickly removed
by submerging the bird in a basin of very hot water, with only the tip of its
bill being held clear. Much relaxed after this, it was given two newly
hatched chicks to care for and strutted around proudly, fussing over its
instant family and bending seeding grasses down for them - the first we
knew that hens did this. Unfortunately, only two weeks earlier we had
rescued the tall, skinny and still starving young Doberman from the pound.
She quickly gave in to temptation and we came home one day to find her
eating the Silky, while the hen's hysterical chicks ran up and down outside
the driveway gate.

THE SOCIETY'S VISIT TO CHESTER ZOO
by Stewart Pyper

On Saturday 13th July the Avicultural Society visited Chester Zoo for
the first time since 1967. The Curator of Birds, Dr Roger Wilkinson, who
members know from his articles in the Avicultural Magazine , arranged the
invitation which the Society was most grateful to accept. The weather was
dry with the temperature rising after lunch.
The collection of birds at Chester is probably the most extensive of any
zoo or bird garden in this country. Certainly its breeding successes in
recent years have no equal. Chester Zoo has at present a total of 26
Avicultural Society Certificates of Merit for UK first breedings. As is
expected nowadays conservation is very important and Chester participates
in a great number of breeding programmes.
There is a varied collection of cranes. Two pairs which particularly
caught my attention were the Wattled and Black-necked Crowned Cranes.
The latter allowed close observation and I thought their charcoal black
feathering very attractive. More pelicans were expected shortly, although
part of their enclosure has been lost to the new monkey house. Owls are
well represented in the collection and we saw young Spectacled and Snowy
Owls. In some of the owl enclosures it seemed strange to see red hot pokers
growing. A pair of Mauritius Kestrels have a spacious flight to themselves.
Roger is very proud of the 'Europe on the Edge' aviary which covers
some 2,000sq m (21,500 sq ft) and contains species, such as, European
Black Vultures, Waldrapp Ibis and White-headed Ducks.
Parrots have for many years been a speciality at Chester Zoo and good
breeding results have been achieved. Among the species we saw were
Blue-throated Conures, Derbyan Parrakeets, Greater Vasas, Blue-throated
Macaws, Green-cheeked Amazons, Blue-eyed Cockatoos, Musschenbroek's
and Duyvenbode's Lories, and White-tailed Black Cockatoos. Humboldt
Penguins have bred well but there is concern that too many collections now
have only stock related to that at Chester.
While walking around one realises how spacious Chester Zoo is - it
covers over 100 acres (40ha). There is a monorail for those who wish to
use it and enjoy an alternative view of the zoo.
From a personal point of view I found the softbills quite outstanding.
We viewed perhaps the only pair of Blue-winged Kookaburras in the country
and mudded-in Wrinkled Hombills within a few days of leaving the nest.
At least two young had been seen at the entrance. Chester achieved the
first UK breeding with this species in 1995. A Royal or Golden-breasted
Starling had been reared and Shamas and Plumbeous Redstarts had also
bred successfully. A pair of Lilac-breasted Rollers presented by our member,

Dr Martin Bourne, had nested successfully and we saw four independent
youngsters. However, the male had killed his partner during the rearing
and had therefore to complete the task on his own. Roulroul Partridges,
Luzon Bleeding Heart Doves, Lesser Green Broadbills and Channel-billed
Toucans were all in perfect condition.
Roger is disappointed that neither the Great Indian or Rhinoceros
Hombills have reproduced - each has a spacious compartment of their own.
The female Great Indian has been mudded-in and Roger believes there
have been chicks. The female's bill is rather rounded at the tip so perhaps
she has problems feeding the chicks properly! A pair of Ferruginous Pygmy
Owls, despite being in a darkened flight, have been a disappointment, as
only infertile eggs have been laid. Finally, as I was leaving, I was shown
some off-show rearing pens housing Satyr Tragopans, some parent-reared
and some which had been hand-reared which were awaiting departure to
other collections.

GREY PARROT LIKELY TO DISAPPEAR FROM KENYA

Owing to continuing forest destmction and the resultant loss of nest
sites, probably fewer than ten Grey Parrots Psittacus erithacus survive in
the Kakamega Forest in western Kenya, according to the recently published
Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania. The Grey Parrot was formerly
fairly common and widespread in both the Kakamega and Nandi Forests.
Small numbers of Red-faced Lovebirds Agapornis pullaria can still be
found in bushed grassland and cultivation along the Uganda-Kenya border.
This species too was formerly more widespread in western Kenya, where it
used to be found from Mt Elgon south to Kakamega and Nyarondo. The
number of Splendid Starlings Lamprotornis splendidus has declined
drastically due to extensive deforestation and the Purple-crested Touraco
Tauraco porphyreolophus chlorochlamys is becoming increasingly rare in
south-east Kenya, and there are no recent records of it from northern
Tanzania. The introduced Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora, formerly common
on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, is found now in small numbers only
on Pemba Island.

This year Paradise Park, at Hayle, Cornwall, has opened a major new
feature called 'Parrot Jungle'. Four large aviaries measuring up to 14ft
(4.3m) high have been constructed to the very high specification needed
for macaws and cockatoos. Housed in them are Palm Cockatoos Probosciger
aterrimus, Blue-throated Macaws Ara glaucogularis, Red-tailed Amazons
Amazona brasiliensis and Toco Toucans Rhamphastos toco. Bamboo, tree
ferns and elephant grass have been planted to enhance the tropical
atmosphere of the area. Further aviaries will be added in the second phase
early in 1997.
New species for Paradise Park include Cape Parrots Poicephalus

Although many Humboldt Penguins Spheniscus humboldti have been

which helps the incubating birds to remain dry and prevents the chilling of
the eggs. At the time of writing there were five eggs in the nests, so more
young may hatch later. A collecting box in the park has this season raised

South Africa though birds are not stolen for monetary gain or as a way of
obtaining rare species. Private collections and bird gardens are being
targeted at night and the birds taken just a short distance, before being
plucked, roasted on a make-shift wood fire and eaten by, it is said, poor,
unemployed local people.
Peafowl, ducks and geese have been taken, pigeons, including five
Nicobar Caloenas nicobarica and two Nutmeg Pigeons Ducula bicolor,
francolins, guineafowl, eight Chinese Painted Quail Excalfactoria chinensis,
and even an African Grey Parrot Psittacus erithacus . Neville Brickell of
the Avicultural Research Unit there wrote to say that during the past 12
months, 45 birds have been reported stolen in KwaZulu-Natal Province.

OVER FIFTY ECHO PARRAKEETS RAISED
The World Parrot Trust based at Paradise Park continues to raise funds
for parrot conservation and welfare. Support has continued for the
endangered Echo Parrakeet P. echo on the island of Mauritius, including
making the arrangements for a visit by Andrew Greenwood to advise the
Jersey Wildlife Trust team headed by Carl Jones. Working with the
Mauritius Wildlife Trust, over 50 Echo Parrakeets have now been raised.
The 'Parrot Action Plan' was given a boost by Ruud and Ria Vonk from

donation of #1,000 (about US$1,500) for this vital project to co-ordinate
parrot research.
Plans for a 'Parrot Sanctuary' at Paradise Park have been announced.
Further accommodation is required so that the many birds offered to the
park can be taken in and housed. These are often pets which have for
many years lived in unsuitable cages, often without seeing another bird.

BLUE QUAIL BECOMING RARE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984956538461538" page_id="56261085"  page_num="142" year="" vol="">
Although the Common and Harlequin Quail Coturnix coturnix coturnix,
Coturnix c, erlangeri &amp; C. delegorguei remain fairly common in East Africa,
the smaller Blue Quail Excalfactoria (or Coturnix ) adansonii is now only
a rare intra-African migrant. It used to breed near Kitale and at Eldama
Ravine, and has bred on the Ngong Escarpment in Kenya. Recently,
however, there has only been a few scattered records of it there during the
rainy season, mainly in the Mara Game Reserve. In northern Tanzania, it
is known now only from the Mkomazi Game Reserve. Though it is thought
that it may still breed on Pemba Island, off the coast of north-eastern
Tanzania. As it is so like the Chinese Painted Quail E. chinensis, so much
so that it is sometimes treated as a race of it, the Blue Quail must surely be
a bird for which it would be relatively easy to institute a captive breeding
programme!

Neville Brickell has written from South Africa to report the first breeding
there of the Broad-tailed Paradise Whydah Vidua orientalis kadugliensis
by Peter Greenaway, a member of the Natal Bird Breeder's Society. The
pair were housed together with a few waxbills and Serinus species in an
aviary measuring 8m long x 3m wide x 1.8m high (26ft long x 9ft 9m wide
x 6ft high). In its natural habitat this whydah uses the Melba Finch Pytilia
melba citerior as its brood host, but in Peter Greenaway's aviary the host
species was the Red-faced Pytilia P hypogrammica. For this rare first
breeding he was awarded a Certificate of Merit by the South African National

RARE PARROT SIGHTED
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986598842105263" page_id="56261086"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
A Birdlife International and Indonesian Department of Nature
Conservation expedition which was evaluating boundaries for a new reserve
to protect the forests of the remote Kelapat Mada Mountain range on the
island of Burn, saw a Black-lored Parrot Tanygnathus gramineus , a species
of which there had only been one reported sighting during the last 70 years.
Members frequently heard large parrots calling at night on the mountains
and are confident that they were this species. If they are correct, it will
confirm suspicions that the lack of records is due to the fact that this parrot
is nocturnal.
The expedition also succeeded in finding two species which were
previously known only from museum specimens collected in the 1920s.
One of these being the Madanga or Rufous-throated White-eye Madanga
ruficollis. It found no signs of the Blue-fronted Lorikeet Charmosyna
toxopei, which has remained virtually unknown since its discovery in 1926.
In 1980 it was reported to be common in plantations and secondary forest
in Teluk Bara. Since when, a Manchester University team and this
expedition both tried for several weeks to find it in the area, but failed.
According to local residents it can be found at inland sites and in some
years appears close to the coast.

In conjunction with Donald Bruning, PhD, Chairman and Curator of
Ornithology of the Wildlife Conservation Society, Ms Drue Bauer is
gathering information about captive Cape Barren or Cereopsis Geese
Cereopsis novaehollandiae for a proposed studbook. Because of the
Australian export ban there is a limited gene pool of Cape Barren Geese
living outside Australia. Collecting information on the captive population
will help co-ordinate breeding management to ensure future generations of
this unique and beautiful species.
The assistance of owners/holders of this species is of utmost importance.
They are asked to determine as accurately as possible the hatching date,
location and parentage of each bird. Even approximate dates and locations
can be helpful. They are also asked to provide details of any deceased
birds, including the date and, if possible, the cause of death. Historical
data will be included in the completed report, the first issue of which will
be sent to all respondents. Owners/holders are asked to complete an
Information Questionnaire for each goose. They may ask for as many
forms as they require or simply have one from which to make the required
number of photocopies. Copies of the Cape Barren Goose Studbook
Information Questionnaire are available from The Avicultural Society (when
writing please state how many forms you require and enclose a stamped
addressed envelope) or direct from Ms Drue Bauer, Studbook Keeper, 57770
722nd Road, Plymouth, Nebraska 68424, USA. Tel: 402-656-3202. Any
additional information is welcomed and can be included on a separate sheet

THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE BLUE-
RUMPED PARROT Psittinus cyanurus AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99461670967742" page_id="56261092"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
by Roger G. Sweeney
The Blue-rumped Parrot Psittinus cyanurus occupies its own monotypic
genus with its closest relatives being the Philippine Guaiabero Parrot
Bolbopsittacus lunulatus and the parrots of the genus Psittacella which
are unknown in European aviculture. The Blue-rumped Parrot measures
just 18cm (Tin) in length and seldom exceeds 85g (not quite 3oz), making
it one of the smaller species of Asian parrots. The male has a greyish-blue
head, with a red upper mandible and a brownish-red lower mandible. The
female has a brown head and a greyish-brown bill. Young birds still in
immature plumage have a green head and generally green body plumage.
However, the green head feathers of most juvenile males have a slight blue
wash, giving an early indication of their gender.
The range of this species covers mainland south-east Asia, from Thailand
through Malaysia to Borneo and Sumatra, Indonesia. Three regional races
have been described (Forshaw, 1989) but the differences appear to be
marginal. The Blue-rumped Parrot is most commonly reported as being
seen in pairs r small groups of adults in their favoured habitat of lowland
forest and woodland, sometimes also being found in orchards and
plantations. At the end of the breeding season, young birds are generally
more gregarious than the adults and can be seen flying in large groups and
often feeding communally in oil palm plantations, which are in fruit soon
after these birds have fledged.
The small size and quiet nature of these birds make them suitable for
keeping indoors in countries with a temperate climate. At Loro Parque the
subtropical climate of the Canary Islands means that our birds remain outside
throughout the year, one pair on exhibition and two pairs in our off-exhibit
breeding centres. The pairs housed in the breeding areas are accommodated
in suspended cages which measure approx. 3m x lm x lm (9ft 9in x 3ft 3in
x 3ft 3in), while the pair on exhibition are housed in a large conventional
aviary which allows the birds access to the floor. The Blue-rumped Parrot
is however very rarely found low down in the aviary, preferring instead to

spend practically all of the time on the highest perches available.
The diet of these birds is as follows:-
Morning feed at 7.00am:- A salad which contains items such as apple,
pear, papaya, tomato, orange, kiwi fruit, prickly-pear, alfalfa, beetroot,
lettuce, carrot, pepper and other seasonally available fruits and vegetables
(most of them diced). A second smaller dish contains a commercial dietary
pellet. During the breeding season a special supplement cake is baked
fresh each day at Loro Parque, and a few pieces of this are added to the
food dish which contains the dietary pellet.
Afternoon feed at 7.00pm:- Seeds such as millet, hemp, niger, sunflower
(just a small amount), safflower etc. and some cooked beans, such as mung
and black-eyed beans, to which are added lentils and cereal grains, along
with pine nuts and peanuts.
All drinking water is purified by first being chlorinated then passed
through a reverse osmosis machine which is equipped with an ultra-violet
light sterilisation unit. Bathing water is provided daily by showers which
are built into the design of every aviary in the park.
Despite having been in the collection at Loro Parque for many years,
successful breeding was not recorded until the current 1996 breeding season.
Towards the end of May, we noticed that copulation was taking place much
more frequently between the two birds on exhibition, and that the female
was starting to spend a lot of time inside the nest-box. The latter measures
45cm x 21cm x 21cm (17 3 Ain x S^in x 814in), with an 8cm (3V^in) entrance
hole. Wood shavings are used as the sole nesting medium.
When the female began to spend extended periods in the nest-box, more
regular nest inspections were carried out and it became clear that the female
was in the process of preparing a scrape in the wood shavings. When the
nest-box was inspected on the 10th June, we found that one egg had been
laid. A week later the clutch had increased to four eggs. Only one hatched.
This took place on the 6th July. The three unhatched eggs measured as

On first viewing the chick in the nest-box, I was instantly reminded of
the newly-hatched chicks of the Guaiabero Parrot, the progress of which I
had followed carefully when breeding this species three years earlier. The
newly-hatched Blue-rumped Parrot had pink skin and lacked natal down.
Some reports have stated that Blue-rumped Parrot chicks have a few strands
of natal down on their backs which are often lost during the first few days

after hatching. The chick described here was already dry and active by this
time and no natal down was present. The chick seemed well cared for by
the female, which seldom left the nest-box even when it was being inspected,
so it was left to be parent-reared. On all subsequent occasions when the
chick was observed in the nest, it had a full crop and seemed to be developing
well.
However, on the 30th July I observed the female outside the nest-box
and was concerned about her stance and movement. The bird was captured
and examined by one of the Loro Parque veterinarians and returned to the
aviary for further observation. By the afternoon our concern had grown
and so, regretfully, the female was recaptured and taken to our clinic facility.
At the same time the chick was removed to our nursery department to be
hand-reared. It weighed 66.8g. The following morning the accompanying
photograph of the chick was taken. In the nursery it continued its
development without any problems. It was fed with Pretty Bird hand-
rearing formula (18% protein and 12% fat). By the 23rd August the chick
was fully feathered and almost weaned. The weights recorded for the chick

The natural fledging age of this species has been reported as being six
weeks (42 days) and the adult weight 85g (Low, 1992). Adults at Loro
Parque have weighed between 75g-83g (average 78g). It is not known
what degree of natural variation there is in the body weights of wild birds
from different regions of the species' range. The chick's growth rate while
in the nursery was comparatively slow when compared to that of other
species, but considering that it had already achieved in the region of 85%
of its expected adult weight (when compared to the average adult weight
records) by the age of 24 days, then the slower growth in the second half of
its development is not surprising. The chick began to be weaned at the age
which would have been expected, had it remained with its parents, and
after weaning its weight settled to that of the adults weighed at Loro Parque.
The Blue-rumped Parrot has been imported into western aviculture on
several occasions during recent decades and on each occasion the birds
generally adjusted well to captivity, living for many years. There was though
no consistent breeding success. Indeed the opposite has been the case,
with very few breeding successes ever being documented. If this species is
to remain in aviculture for future generations to enjoy, a much better
understanding is needed of its requirements and consistent breeding must
be achieved.

The Pink-throated Twinspot Hypargos margaritatus may also be known
as the Rosy or Verreaux's Twinspot. It is about 5in (13cm) long and the
male and female are visually sexable. The male's crown, nape, mantle and
wings are russet brown. The face, sides of the neck and chin, down to the
breast are pinkish mauve, with the lower breast, flanks and belly black,
with pinkish white spots. The lower rump and upper tail-coverts are dark
pinkish mauve and the tail is black, washed with wine-red. In the case of
the female, the pinkish mauve of the head and breast is replaced by pale
grey, and the spots on the underparts are white. A juvenile, on leaving the
nest, was observed to have earth-brown upperparts with a russet tinge, a
pale pinkish rump and a narrow black band at the base of the tail. The
underparts were greyish-brown.

those of the better-known Peters' Twinspot H. niveoguttatus but, as a rule,
inhabits drier habitat. Its call is like that of a firefinch, a trilling 'tit, tit

An oval-shaped nest, consisting of leaf ribs and skeletons, mixed with
leaves, inflorescences and spiders' webs, lined with palm fibre, and with a
side entrance 4-6cm (Wi-lVrin) in diameter, observed in the wild, was
sited at the base of a palm frond. The nesting season is given as January in
northern KwaZulu-Natal. Incubation and nestling periods in the wild are,
apparently, unrecorded.
The first captive breeding was recorded in 1968, by a German
aviculturist, R. Burkard. The nest was built in a half-open finch nest-box,
placed in an exposed position in the aviary. The clutch consisted of four
eggs, from which three nestlings were reared to maturity. My (C.K.)
breeding of this species in South Africa is the only other known record.
The pair were housed in an aviary measuring 3m long x 1.2m x 2.1mm
high (9ft 9in x 4ft x 6ft lOin). A sheet of flat asbestos was used as a roof
covering for the purpose of giving privacy to these shy, delicate birds. For
extra seclusion about 70% of the ground area was covered with Feather
Grass Pennisetum villosum and a single Southern Mountain Bamboo

Arundinaria tesellata. As a nest site, a large dried-out exotic shrub was
suspended from the aviary roof. Fortunately, the pair found it to their
liking and were soon observed constructing a nest of Teff Grass Eragrostis
tef which was lined with Natal Redtop Rhynchelytrum repens and finished
off by the addition of a small protruding platform no more than 3cm (FAin)
in front of the entrance hole.
Four eggs were duly laid, of which three hatched after an incubation
period of 14 days. At ten days old the nestlings were fitted with closed
rings and registered with the Natal Bird Breeder's Society. Burkard (1968)
described the mouth markings as 'consisting on 3 black spots on a yellow
area of palate; the gape tubercles are blue, the rest of the mouth and the
tongue reddish'. The fledging period for my birds was 20 days.
The diet of the adults consisted of Japanese millet, including spouting
seeds, mixed millets, with the addition of canary seed, cultivated wild grass
seed and a daily supply of mound termites. Avi-Plus Canary Rearing Food
was fed to them daily during the breeding.

One of the biggest challenges in a mixed species aviary is ensuring all
birds consume adequate amounts of nutritionally appropriate diets. Here
we describe the results of an eight day feeding trial conducted in a mixed
species exhibit at the Wildlife Conservation Society, Bronx, New York.
The study was performed with three main objectives:
1) to document dietary preferences,
2) measure daily intake of nutrients for comparison with estimated
requirements,
3) determine the economics of food wastage.

Apart from garnishes, other specific foods (mealworms and peanuts)
used for management purposes were offered in limited quantities during
the course of this study. The birds were fed twice daily, using a total of
seven food pans placed at varying heights in the exhibit. All food offered
and any remaining was weighed for an eight day period. The types and
amounts of food offered to the entire group during the course of this study
are listed in Table 1, diet assignments by species are given in Table 2.
Intake and Nutrient Composition of Diets
Estimated maintenance energy requirements (in kcal) were calculated
from body weights using equations for passerines [((115 kcal)W 075 ) x 2 x
number of individuals] or non-passerines [((74 kcal)W 075 ) X 2 X number
of individuals] where W is body weight in kilograms (Robbins, 1993). Total
kcal requirement for the entire group was determined by summing individual
species (Table 2). Actual body weights based on animal records were used
for most of this calculation, except estimates (Dunning, 1993) were used
for the Black Drongo and Red-winged Laughing Thrush.
Measured consumption of diet ingredients is shown in Table 3. Nutrient
composition of diets offered versus consumed (Table 4) was determined
using the Animal Nutritionist software program (N-Squared Computing,
Silverton, OR), with human metabolizable energy (ME) values used to
estimate calories in produce items. Actual digestibility (metabolizability)
of various produce items has not been determined for birds. Because of the
simpler digestive anatomy of most avian species and shorter residence time
of food in the gastrointestinal tract, it is likely that human ME values
overestimate the calories that would be provided to bird species consuming
the same diet items.
Clearly, certain items were highly preferred and consumed almost
entirely (peanuts, mealworms [management foods, not considered regular
diet ingredients], grapes, blueberries, and vitamin-E seed). Softbill Fare(R)
and soaked dog kibble appeared the least preferred diet items regardless of
time of feeding. Apples and chopped kale were consumed in moderation.
A total of 637g dry matter (DM) was offered to this exhibit group daily
(1712g as-fed basis), with 369g DM consumed (1070g as-fed basis).
Approximately 40% of the diet (DM or as-fed basis) was discarded daily.
Dry matter intake (DMI) amounted to 13.0% of total body mass (2.839 kg)
of the exhibit group.
Diets offered were high in soluble carbohydrates (CHO), and overall
met nutrient requirements established for adult domestic poultry (see
Table 4), the most complete avian model available. However, the overall
nutrient composition may be marginal for reproductive or rapidly growing
chicks of some species. Birds selected diets that were somewhat lower in

<bodyText confidence="0.999386357142857" page_id="56261101"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
protein and fat, and higher in CHO, than offered. Calcium (Ca)
requirements of breeding chickens (3.78% of DM), an indeterminate layer,
likely greatly overestimate the Ca requirements of any of the species in this
study although no detailed requirements are available. The Ca:P ratio of
the diet consumed by birds in this study, 1.27:1, is within suggested ranges
(1:1 to 2:1; Robbins, 1993). Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E were
consumed in quantities well above estimated requirements, but no apparent
health problems have been linked to excessive levels of these nutrients in
our collection. Because vitamins A, D, and E are synergistic and
antagonistic (Olson, 1984), it may be prudent to evaluate all three in ratio
with respect to each other (100:10:1, A:D:E). We also evaluated iron content
in the diet, as excess dietary iron it has been suggested may cause problems
in starlings as well as hornbills (Dierenfeld et ah, 1991), and found it to be
within suggested limits (&lt;200 mg/kg DM).
Total kcal offered (2215; see Table 4) to this exhibit group during the
trial averaged 220% of estimated requirements. Quantified intake indicated
1291 kcal consumed, or 128% of calculated energy requirements. As a
general guideline, we attempt to develop diets that contain 130-150% of
total estimated calories to minimize potential selection of nutritionally
imbalanced items while at the same time providing a 'cushion of safety'
for unknown energetics of birds.
From this study it is apparent that we could reduce waste while still
providing palatable, nutritionally balanced diets initially by simply
eliminating or decreasing least preferred items. However, limit-feeding
preferred items identified is also an important consideration. Peanuts and
mealworms are excessive in fat and deficient in calcium, and
unsupplemented fruits such as grapes and blueberries contain very little
protein and are also poor sources of calcium. These nutritionally imbalanced
foods should be offered in limited amounts to minimize potential problems.
We attempt to offer such items as 'management foods' for enticement,
medicating, censusing, etc., and limit calorie intake of management foods
to no more than 20% of total estimated needs. The calculated kcal estimate
of 1005/day for this group (see Table 2) would thus allow approximately
200kcal from management foods. In this trial, the mealworms and peanuts
provided 59kcal while garnishes (soaked kibble, horsemeat, and chopped
kale) provided 286kcal offered (Table 5). Thus 345kcal were offered as
management foods or 34% of estimated needs. However, the birds actually
consumed only 147 kcal from these foods or 11% of estimated needs because
they wasted much of the soaked kibble from the am and pm diets (Table 5).
On average, the birds consumed less food, but more total calories (higher
energy content in food items) during the daylight period (when active)
than during the night even though food was available for more hours

following the afternoon feeding. A majority of energy supplied during the
day was from dry foods - avian pellets (approximately 46% of total kcal)
and supplemented seeds (coated with vitamin E and calcium carbonate;
20% of total kcal). A nutritionally balanced (to the best of our knowledge)
supplemented produce salad supplied a further 20% of kcal consumed.
Thus 86% of dietary energy intake was provided by only three food items.
From the data collected, energy requirements for birds eating certain
diets can be calculated and compared with actual energy intake. The MIXED
diet (bird salad + softbill diet), SOFTBILL diet (softbill diet, horsemeat,
and soaked dog kibble) and PELLET/SALAD diet (Avi-Pels(R) + bird salad)
all contained at least one food item in common. Table 5 shows that
approximately 700 kcal was consumed from these three diets daily. In this
study, the MIXED diet eaters (Fairy Bluebird, Golden crested Mynah, Red-
winged Laughing Thrush, Sooty-headed Bulbul, and Gaudy Red-fronted
Barbet), had an estimated energy requirement of 206 kcal/day. The Black
Drongo, a SOFTBILL diet eater, was expected to need about 42 kcal/day.
The Bulwer's Wattled Pheasant, which ate PELLETS/SALAD, should have
needed 381 kcal/day (Table 2). Thus these three sets of birds would have
had an estimated energy requirement of 630 kcal/day which would have
been met by the combined ingredients in the diets consumed. The three
Indian Pygmy Geese, consuming crumbles and supplemented seeds, required
a calculated 134 kcal per day. These diet ingredients, as eaten, provided
248 kcal thus energy requirements for this species were underestimated, or
other birds consumed the remainder. The pair of Northern Pied Hornbills
needed a calculated 242 kcal per day; 278 kcal was provided by the fruits
consumed.
Economic Considerations and Dietary Recommendations
Intake and preference data resulted in an economic evaluation of
approximately US$1.04 (roughly 65p) per day in wasted food (see Table 5).
A preferred diet item, bird salad, contributed approximately one-third of
the cost of wastage, while a less preferred commercial product (Softbill
Fare) comprised almost half the daily wastage (US$0.47 (roughly 29p)).
Specific recommendations from the single study include:-
1) modification of current low-iron softbill diet and/or identification,
and testing of a new product for the feeding programme
2) decrease amount of bird salad offered to this group by one-quarter
to minimize wastage
3) eliminate soaked dog kibble as a management food in this exhibit
group
4) ensure that management foods supply no more than 20% of measured
calorie intake daily

Which aviculturist does not want to be remembered for something special
in recording keeping and perhaps breeding some rare species at least once
in his or her lifetime - something which has not hitherto been achieved by
anyone else? It has been my good fortune to have this happen several
times and one of the rarest species I have ever kept is a small and beautiful
species, Severtzov's Tit Warbler Leptopoecile sophiae.

Closely related to the Goldcrest Regulus regulus and Firecrest R.
ignicapillus the weight of these tiny birds does not exceed 5-7g. My birds
came from the vicinity of Alma-Ata, where they winter. Otherwise, they
live and breed in the sub-alpine zone where forest gives way to dwarf pines.
In Kazakhstan they are found only in the Tan-Shan mountains and
Dzchungar Altai.
In A Field Guide to the Birds of the USSR (Flint, Boehme and Kostin),
the plumage is described as '...softly feathered and Huffy'. Colouring is
best described as exquisite - the crown is cinnamon-brown with a violet
tinge, neck and back grey, wings and tail black-brown, throat, breast, flanks
and rump violet-blue, abdomen cinnamon. There is a clearly defined light
brown eye-stripe. The female is duller with a grey-brown undersurface.
It is clear that my birds were captured by netting. It surprises me how
they were able to survive a long plane journey from Tashkent to Prague,
and then to Bratislava. It may be something of a miracle they survived
bearing in mind the speed of metabolism of insectivorous birds.
Despite the fact that the friend who sent them to me fed them on the
smallest mealworms, the male cowered and was soft-feathered when released
into his quarantine cage. 1 immediately installed an infra-red lamp which
conspicuously increased the environment temperature.
The bird was fed only on the wingless form of Drosophila melanogaster
and the smallest mealworms. Although it improved within a few days it
was never completely healthy and died two months after arrival. We cannot
comment on the reproduction of these birds in captivity for it is considered
a great success if they survive for more than half a year.
Because of their very small body weight it is not feasible to initiate any
therapy because disease develops quickly into an acute form. Then the
birds stop eating and this signifies impending death because of their fast
metabolism.
They need a continuous supply of food and are particular about diet and
temperature. As a result, these coloured beauties have almost certainly
never been bred. Moreover, they are also rare in the wild and their import
into Europe or elsewhere is extremely rare and sporadic. They arrived in
Slovakia only on this one occasion. I consider excellent conditions of
transportation, diversity of diet, strict hygiene of the breeding facility and
quality of air as very important elements in small tit breeding. It is only
with such conditions that these delightful birds may be bred .

BREEDING THE SINGING STARLING Aplonis cantoroides
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.975350525" page_id="56261108"  page_num="161" year="" vol="">

The Singing Starling Aplonis cantoroides measures about 18cm (Tin)
long and is the only Papua New Guinea red- eyed glossy starling with a
fairly short, square tail. The sexes are similar. Adult birds appear entirely
black but in the sunlight have an iridescent dark oil-green colouring. The
iris is bright red or orange-red and the bill, legs and feet are black. They
have a tuneful whistle compared to most other starlings. Immature birds
are dull brown with whitish underparts streaked with dark brown. The iris
is brown, later becoming lighter until the final adult colour is attained.
This species is very similar to the Philippine Glossy Starling A.
panayensis but there are one or two subtle differences. Probably the most
notable being the longer throat hackles possessed by A. cantoroides. In its
natural habitat in Papua New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and other
islands - extending to the eastern Solomon Islands - the Singing Starling
appears mainly around coastal areas, right up to the forest edge but rarely
into the forest itself. It can be seen singly, in pairs or large post-breeding
flocks. It nests in tree cavities, on cliff faces, and in the roofs of houses,
etc., and where sufficient nest sites are available nests colonially, with several
pairs occupying the same tree or house roof. Some co-exist within colonies
of the Shining, Metallic or Colonial Starling A . metallica. Nesting material
usually consists of dried grasses and fibres. Two or three pale blue, brownish
speckled eggs appear to be the normal dutch. They are very active birds
and are known to feed on a variety of fruits, including papaya, Capsicum
frutescens and the fruit from the Arecaceae, plus a few flying insects.
My two extremely flighty birds were obtained 10th May 1992 and the
following morning were introduced into a 4m x 2m x 1m (13ft x 6ft 6in x
3ft 3in) flight, which had the rear top, back and sides covered to 1m
(3ft 3in) They were the only occupants. It has a shingle floor covering
and an ornamental bird bath placed conveniently at the end of the flight to
enable the water to be changed regularly. Three large apple tree branches
were placed in the flight to provide a variety of perching. At the covered
end, I hung a 38cm x 25cm (15in x lOin) nest-box (with a hinged lid), into
which was placed dried grasses and coconut fibre.
These birds had previously been fed on some type of softbill food but,
not knowing exactly what it consisted of, I gradually introduced them to
the mix that I use for all my softbills. It contains eggs, wholemeal flour,
soya flour, honey, sultanas, a proprietary egg food, cheese, beef dripping,
peanut butter, castor sugar and a yeast extract. Apple, pear and mealworms
were also introduced. The mix I prepared was readily taken, as was the
apple, but not the pear or mealworms.

After a few weeks they settled down and were soon in perfect condition.
They loved to bath several times a day - but only in fresh water. When the
sun shone, it made their colouring even more iridescent. While watching
them during an extremely warm day, one was observed displaying. It
squatted on the perch with its wings partially fanned and fluttering very
fast. Whilst doing this, its tail was being fully raised and lowered very
slowly. It then began to sing quite melodiously - not the usual down(TM)
slurred 'teyeww' - and finished off with what could best be described as a
throaty rattle. Meanwhile the other bird started the wing fluttering,
accompanied by a little song and, just prior to copulation they stood close
together with their heads thrown back and their beaks almost touching.
This ended with both birds looking over each other's shoulder, with their
cheeks almost touching. As they had been fitted with split rings of different
colours it was possible to sex them at the time of copulation. Obviously,
the one which had done the majority of the displaying was the male and it
was also noted that each bird's song was slightly different. The whole
performance was repeated three times within about ten minutes.
It was noted that they took turns of approximately 15 minutes in the
nest-box. They would each come out to feed, have a bath, then perch in
front of the nest-box and appear to be tapping it. This seemed to be a
signal for the bird inside to come out. Occasionally, they would both come
out and then return to the nest-box together. Early in June, while topping-
up the fruit-fly culture, I noticed that both birds were out of the nest-box.
This gave me the opportunity to take a quick look inside. They had made a
tidy nest with the dried grasses and coconut fibres and there were three
pale blue eggs with brownish speckling confined mainly to the widest end
of the eggs.
Later, after an empty egg shell was found on the floor of the flight, a lot
of activity started taking place. The male hawked insects - possibly fruit-
flies - on the weeds, which by then covered the entire floor to a height of
about 1m (3ft Sin). He was also taking one or two mealworms. If a
particularly large mealworm was chosen, he would take it up to the highest
perch and thrash it against it. After which he appeared to swallow it and
fly straight back to the nest-box to feed it to the female, presumably by
regurgitation.
Later some mealworms were cut into small pieces, but these were totally
ignored. Pear, by this time, was being eaten and the apple completely
ignored. At this stage, I decided to give them some waxworms and later
one or two were missing. With so little information available about their
feeding habits everything was by trial and error.
The birds continued to ignore the apple, but were by then taking nearly
half a pear. Again, only one or two mealworms were being taken and
about the same number of waxworms. It was also noted that the female
appeared to be taking longer turns in the nest-box. For a short period of

time all the softbill mix, pear and mealworms were removed and a dish
containing a couple of slices of pawpaw (papaya) and a few waxworms was
introduced to see if they would take either of them. During this time they
were seen sitting on the top of the fruit-fly bin and judging by their snapping
actions were, presumably, taking some of the fruit-flies.
After about an hour the dish was inspected and it was found that they
certainly had a distinct liking for pawpaw but the waxworms remained
untouched. The dish containing the softbill mix, into which I put 15 small
waxworms, plus the halved pear, some chopped apple and the remainder of
the uneaten pawpaw was returned to the feeding station. Still the
performance at the nest-box entrance continued and the female still appeared
to be taking longer turns inside. As so much seemed to be going on, I
decided it would be easier to keep in the birdroom, a daily record of the
happenings. So, from then on, detailed records were kept of the amount
and variety of food offered and the amount actually taken. This was done
by weighing it all on an electronic scale. Details of the times of feeding,
the outside temperatures and weather conditions, both mornings and
evenings, were also recorded. I found that on average the two birds were
consuming 35g of softfood each day, plus 85g of mixed fruits, consisting of
apple, pear, pawpaw and grapes. Later elderberries became a firm favourite
but mango and kiwi fruit were ignored. All this time there still appeared to
be no real enthusiasm for mealworms and the waxworms were now being
totally ignored. To try to encourage them to take mealworms, each day
several were thrown on to the floor. All these changes in their eating
habits seemed to be building up to the hatching of the chicks.
Towards the end of the month the sieve on top of the fruit-fly culture
was getting rather messy, so I decided that the whole lot would have to be
taken out to be cleaned. On doing so, dozens of mealworms were discovered
underneath the container, so obviously they were not eating as many as I
had thought. Whilst in the flight I decided to look inside the nest-box;
hoping that this would not put off the adults. There, huddled in the right-
hand comer alongside an unhatched egg, were two black, reasonably well-
feathered, open-eyed chicks, with light coloured beaks. The chicks appeared
to be approximately 6cm (almost IViin) in length. I guessed that they were
about ten days old, but with the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge
gained from the second clutch, now know that they must have been older -
they were probably about 14-15 days old.
By the next day the chicks were calling so loudly that they could be
heard from about 20m (65ft) away. From then on, naturally enough, food
consumption increased. The softfood intake almost doubled and fruit had
to be provided twice a day. Small amounts of mealworms were also being
taken. Both adults took turns to feed the chicks and to keep the nest free of
faeces, though it appeared that the female put in that little extra effort.
During their rest-periods both adults took the opportunity to bath and preen

<bodyText confidence="0.999488113636364" page_id="56261111"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
but this came to an abrupt end as soon as the chicks started calling.
The 4th July (American Independence Day) was chosen by the chicks
as the day they made their first appearance in the outside world. They just
launched themselves into the flight and flew to and fro as though they had
been doing so for years. The most striking thing was how big they were -
they were about two-thirds the size of their parents. The back and wings
were a darkish-brown. The chin to the abdomen appeared to be a fawnish
colour with dark brown streaks. The eyes were dark brown and the beak a
light fawn with a creamy coloured gape. The tail was a straight, square-
shaped affair, albeit a little on the stumpy side.
Everything carried on as normal for a few weeks, until it was noticed
that the adults were going through the same performance as before, prior
to laying. However, they continued to be first-class parents. On the 14th
of the month an egg was discovered but I was not sure whether it was the
egg left over from the previous clutch. Three days later there were four
eggs in the nest, therefore, one had to be an old one. The first of three
chicks appeared on the 19th. It was completely bald and had its eyes closed
(they took approximately 14 days to open). The immature starlings were
still living in the flight and the adults continued to feed them on demand.
It was noted that although the immatures' eyes were still mainly brown,
they were definitely changing to an orange-red and this in turn, it was felt,
could have been a stimulus to the male to start gently harassing them. Of
course, a more logical reason could have been the maintenance of the new
brood. This situation went on for a couple of days, so when all the chicks
of the second clutch had hatched, I decided - with some trepidation - that it
was time to move the by then self-sufficient immature starlings to a flight
adjacent to that of their parents.
A nest-box, similar to that in their previous flight, was placed undercover
at the rear. The feeding dishes were all of the same type, as were the
drinking and bathing arrangements. After a flighty entrance they found
everything they required in a matter of minutes and by late evening had
settled down quite nicely. The following day and for about a further week
the weather changed dramatically. It alternated between light drizzle and
heavy rain but they all carried on quite normally.
On the 14th August, the first of the second clutch left the nest, with its
two siblings following the next day. By the time the decision was made to
move the second round of immature starlings, the weather broke once again
and we had continuous bad weather for about a fortnight but, 15th
September, they were moved and like their predecessors, went into their
new accommodation quite happily. Between them the five immature birds
devoured about 60g (2oz) of softfood a day, plus a selection of chopped
fruits (apple, pear, pawpaw, grapes, elderberries and pomegranate). By the
end of the month the need to keep daily records was considered unnecessary
but any changes, however slight, were recorded. The adults were still in

their own flight and looked immaculate and a week later, a third clutch of
eggs was discovered in the nest but these were never hatched.
Early in November one of the immature starlings was found dead in the
flight - its death was, I assumed, caused by the plague of cats that we suffer
from in this area. When the eldest of the immature birds was caught up, it
was noted that a patch of oily-green feathering was breaking through around
the lesser and greater wing-coverts and another patch was running down
the back, from the nape to the rump.
Ten months later, my immature birds had still not moulted into adult
plumage. They remained in perfect condition, as did the breeding adults
which had, incidentally, just laid two eggs and were in the process of rearing
one chick. I have found it extremely difficult to find anything specific
about these most delightful little starlings, but by this time felt far more
confident knowing I had a year's experience and a folder full of notes to
which to refer and, hopefully, add to.
At 21 days old, the chick was found dead at the bottom of the flight.
This really was a bad start to the season but then again, was it too early for
them to make a start in such cold and changeable weather? Should I have
split up the pair until the weather became more reasonable? Should I have
simply removed the nest-box from autumn to spring? These are good
examples of not knowing what to do and learning from your mistakes.
Something that was new to me, was to see one of the immature birds
flying around with a piece of hay in its beak and trying to pass it through
the netting to one of the adults. Is this a sign that it was in breeding
condition? Do immature birds pair-up and breed? Apparently, they do
pair-up in Papua New Guinea, but it is not known whether they breed.
After a year the first immature starlings still had not achieved their full
breeding plumage but were certainly getting the very dark oily-green colour
on their mantles. In fact, it was almost 15 months before the first one
attained adult plumage. By this time the breeding pair had two more
fully-fledged chicks. So, once again, everything was about to happen for
the third time, but I now knew that I could handle it all with much more
confidence.

A BIRD IN THE DOVECOTE IS WORTH TWO IN THE
BUSH

It is hard to believe that in the recent past a regular supply of fresh meat
was a rare occurrence. The luxury of a fridge or a domestic freezer was
unheard of and there were not the techniques available to preserve food for
long periods after its production. The name of the game was self survival
centred on home grown produce and the availability of seasonal treats from
nature's larder.
In medieval England the manorial unit was governed by a strict set of
laws and rights which filtered down from the lord to the lowly cotter,
ensuring that the landed gentry derived maximum benefit from their tenants.
This enabled them to develop a lifestyle in which food production methods
generated a supply of fresh meat all year round and provided a welcome
relief from salted beef. In most cases this included the provision of fish
such as carp and eels reared in stew ponds and other alternative systems
including deer parks and rabbit warrens. Without doubt however the most
numerous and popular choice of meat was that of the humble pigeon,
cultivated and lovingly cared for in purpose built houses.
The right to keep one of these special houses was limited by law up
until 1500 and clearly restricted the privilege to manors and ecclesiastical
fiefs. This feudal right was attached to the role of the baron, abbots and
lords of the manor and was latterly extended to the parish priest. This
might explain why the dovecote at Dunster in Somerset is thought to be
contemporary with the church (c. 1150) according to the church guidebook
(9th edition, 1966). The social importance placed upon fresh meat was
highlighted by Olivier de Serres in 1600 in his book on agriculture and
husbandry, when he wrote: ' No man need ever have an ill provisioned
house if there but be attached to it a dovecote, a warren and a fishpond
wherein meat may be found as readily at hand as if it were stored in a
larder. Certainly a vast pigeon and rabbit pie is a most useful standing
dish in a country house both for members of the family and for chance
droppers in, and then if properly managed there will always remain
somewhat to sell over and above what is consumed at home\
The importance placed upon the Culverhouse and its feathered
inhabitants naturally afforded status to the bird as well as the building. A
common misconception amongst the peasantry was that the Lord's voracious
pigeons were responsible for damage to their crops. Most of this predation
was presumed rather than proved because the birds picked up only spilled
grain and fed primarily on weed seeds and on small molluscs. However
such was the power of the landed classes that in the reign of Edward II
(1314-1315) the taking of a bird was punishable under a Law of 7.

The feral pigeon of today is descended largely from the original dovecote
inhabitants bred extensively in the medieval period. These birds are assumed
to have originated from the Rock Dove Columba livia. Throughout its
history this humble bird has been valued for a number of domestic and
social purposes ranging from the practical to the sublime. As an example,
in the medieval period a widely recommended remedy for baldness involved
mixing the bird's dung with watercress and applying it to the scalp in the
form of a warm ointment. Perhaps even more distasteful was a remedy
endorsed by Pliny during the Roman period (P. &amp; G. Hansell), whereby its
blood was said to cure bloodshot eyes. A live one cut in half and applied to
the soles of the feet was said to cure melancholy or madness. It was a
remedy which would surely have confirmed madness rather than cured it!
The versatile pigeon had a variety of uses other than its primary table
function. Each by-product produced from the birds, ranging from the
feathers to dung, was of great value. Surplus plumage was used to stuff
pillows and beds and was thought to extend the life of the lucky recipients.
Similarly the dung was perceived as a valuable commodity, an interesting
contrast to the modern day menace of pigeon droppings in city centres. In
Kent, for instance, one cart load was said to be worth at least ten times that
of any other dung, and even the tanning industry found it an aid to softening
leather.
The pigeon was also exploited for its sporting value. Many dovecotes
provided quarry for the mediaeval field sport of falconry whilst in recent
centuries they delivered the entertainment for shooting matches. However
their main resurgence into the sphere of domestic social life has been through
the sport of pigeon racing and fancying which is still a popular pastime as
we approach the millennium. Who would have ever thought that single
birds would exchange hands for the vast sums that they do today, on an
international, as opposed to parochial level?
The British Isles displays a multitude of dovecotes, columbaria or 'culver
houses' (Culver is Anglo-Saxon for pigeon) dependant upon your preferred
choice of name. The Jacobean traveller, Fynes Mary son is noted for stating
that: 'no kingdome of the Worlde hath so many Dove-houses\ Certainly
their form and colloquial style is varied and diverse, ranging from the
humble Cornish structures to the elaborate and flamboyant cotes of
Oxfordshire and the Home Counties. It is estimated that by the 17th century
there were 26,000 such structures in England alone, with a figure nearer
30,000 for the whole of the British Isles. With an average of 700 nesting
holes this would mean that approximately 20 million pigeons were being
reared in these purpose built houses. In the Duchy (of Cornwall) however
we have only about 100 references to dovecotes in the county although we
can assume that there were probably many more.
The most common style of dovecote comprises a circular tower although

you can also find square and rectangular forms. These narrow at the top to
leave an access hole or louvre (also called a glover) usually covered by a
slate or cupola to keep out driving rain. The arrangement of the roof varies
in shape and design according to custom and available materials. In
Cornwall most of the dovecotes are made from slate stone and have corbelled
roofs (a 13th or 14th century feature of English cotes) although a magnificent
granite example survives at Bussow Vean near Towednack. The walls are
usually of dry stone construction and can be unusual in that some contain
'through holes' allowing direct access to the interior. This is a unique
feature to the Duchy with only one other similar example in west Wales.
The location of the building was an important consideration and some
were placed a great distance from the main house to avoid the birds pilfering
from the garden. Conversely however others abutted the property and it
would appear that a primary consideration was the availability of water
and shelter. There was a general feeling in the medieval period that
disturbance or noise would upset the pigeons and encourage them to leave
the cote. Great pains were therefore taken in selecting suitable sites.
Access to the dovecote is through a low stepped wooden doorway which
prevented vermin from entering and retained any dung. Inside the nesting
holes are arranged in alternate courses. They usually begin at a suitable
height above ground level and in some cases, such as at Lamorran, possess
shallow slate sills. Unlike those outside of Cornwall, most of the nesting
holes are rectangular in plan, some with a slightly splayed interior, although
classic 'L' shaped examples ('so that your bird sits dark and private ' Hansell,
P.J.) exist at Rosteague and in the remnants at St. Michael Penkevil.
Interestingly, the average number of nesting holes per cote (about 250) is
considerably smaller than that in the rest of the country, where 500-1,000
is more usual. However this in itself can be misleading when calculating
the number of birds. There appears to have been a general assumption that
three nesting holes were required for every two pairs of breeding birds.
The feral pigeon is an active and productive bird which mates for life.
Each pair within a dovecote could be relied on to breed for up to seven
years and were capable of producing at least two squabs (unfledged young)
every six weeks. These grew quickly and could attain 11b (453g) in weight
within three weeks, thus testifying to the richness of 'pigeon milk'. This
half-digested food produced by the adults was incredibly cost effective,
when one considers that most of their diet was accrued from the wider
countryside. Indeed, only a small amount of grain was fed to them by their
owners to encourage them to return to the cote and to supplement their diet
in poor weather. However, there is some evidence that in parts of England
artificial food was prepared by 'professional chewers', who partly ground
grain for the delectation and delight of their feathered friends.

The unsuspecting squabs were usually harvested at four weeks of age,
prior to the development of their pin feathers and the desire to fly. This
avoided the birds gaining flight muscles and ensured that they were at
their most succulent when presented at the table. Such a management
regime meant that a pair of birds laying two eggs at a time were capable of
producing 14 squabs a year. When you extrapolate this to the average size
of an English dovecote (with up to 1,000 holes) about 200 squabs a week
could have been produced. However, in a Cornish context (with 150 - 250
nesting holes per cote) perhaps 30 - 50 squabs would be more realistic.
The general day to day maintenance of a dovecote rarely required a
full-time employee. Great care was however taken in settling the birds
into their new home and they were usually confined inside for a short while
to avoid them straying. This also allowed them to pair and mate,
strengthening the bond between the birds and the building. Stock was
procured from some distance away, even from as far afield as France, to
lessen the chance of the pigeons returning to their old lofts.

The Halwyn dovecote was first recorded in a written deed dated 1347
The interior walls of some dovecotes in Cornwall were clearly
whitewashed although one can imagine that the birds themselves might
have contributed to this aspect of building maintenance. Access to the
nesting holes was gained by means of a 'potence' (derived from the French
term for gallows) which must have been a technological boon in its day. A
stout central pole was carefully pivoted from above and below, and ladders
could subsequently be attached to lateral arms. This enabled all the holes
to be cleaned systematically whilst providing the option for further
attachments such as alighting platforms. These encouraged birds to mate
within the cote. Regrettably no original examples survive in Cornwall
although a classic example call be viewed at Dunster in Somerset.
In Cornwall it would appear that a certain amount of superstition
developed around the dovecotes and their ability to trap wayward spirits.

A reference by T.W. Cleave (O.C. 1937) to Trevanion Culverhay near
Wadebridge noted that nine of the nest holes in the second row had been
carefully blocked in. He summarised that these were at the level of a kneeling
person&apos;s head and that the closed holes might represent the ' the custody of
exorcised spirits&apos;. This unusual statement appears to be backed up by
Charles Henderson (Essays, 1935), who made reference to the vicar at
Penwame in Mawnan, who along with fellow 'ghost layers' (ghost busters!)
was active in the 18th century. They apparently used whips to drive the
evil spirits into the holes before carefully sealing them.
A classic example of a Cornish dovecote at Tintagel. It has
small slate stone walls and still retains its original louvre.
The North Cornwall Heritage Coast and Countryside Service has recently
been involved in a restoration project on a dovecote at Halwyn, near St.
Issey. The structure is the oldest known cote in Cornwall and was referred
to in a deed dated 1347. It now stands as a semi-circular ruin and has been
carefully stabilised with a special grant through English Heritage&apos;s
Monument Management Fund. The work was undertaken by a local mason
with support and help from the landowners and a number of bodies in the
North Cornwall area. In addition to this fine example there are two others
which are worthy of mention. The first (also restored recently) is at
Trevanion near Wadebridge and the other, which still retains its original
louvre, is in the vicarage garden at Tintagel.

CHESTER ZOO BIRD REVIEW 1996
by Roger Wilkinson

<bodyText confidence="0.978478" page_id="56261121"  page_num="174" year="" vol="">
Highlights of the 1996 breeding season at Chester Zoo were our first
successful breedings of Pink Pigeon Columba (Nesoenas) mayeri and Blue-
throated Conure Pyrrhura cruentata. Other important breedings included
Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis, West African Crowned Cranes
Balearica pavonina pavonina , Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis,
Wrinkled Hornbill Aceros corrugatus. Red-fronted Macaws Ara rubrogenys,
Lilacine Amazons Amazona autumnalis lilacina. Green-cheeked Amazons
Amazona viridigenalis, Cuban Amazons Amazona leucocephala , Blue-eyed
Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica, Yellow-throated Laughing Thrushes
Garrulax galbanus and Bali Starlings Leucopsar rothschildi. Not to be
forgotten was the rearing of a record 25 Humboldt's Penguins Spheniscus
humboldti in the summer of 1996.
Exciting new arrivals at Chester Zoo in 1996 included White-naped
Cranes Grus vipio, Masked Plovers Vanellus miles miles , Orange-fronted
Fruit Doves Ptilinopus aurantiifrons. Green Wood Hoopoes Phoeniculus
purpureus , Red-winged Laughing Thrushes Garrulax formosus. Blue
Whistling Thrushes Myiophoneus caeruleus, and a handsome male
Spangled Cotinga Cotinga cayana. Less exciting to look at but
conservationally important newcomers were pairs of Meller's Ducks Anas
melleri and South Georgia Pintails Anas georgica.
The White-naped Cranes, a sibling pair, came to us from Jersey Zoo.
We shortly expect to receive from Whipsnade an important but old wild
caught male to pair with the young egg-laying female. Whipsnade's male
is under-represented in that he only has one surviving youngster. Although
he has not fertilised an egg for ten years we have agreed to try him with our
young female for perhaps a couple of seasons in the hope that a change of
scenery and mate might prove re-invigorating. We are facing the opposite
problem with our Red-crowned Cranes Grus japonensis. Since 1991 they
have bred every year with a total of nine chicks now bred from this pair.
The majority have proved to be females and it is already difficult to find
unrelated males to pair with these youngsters. The EEP breeding
programme recommends slowing down or terminating breeding by this
pair and we are now looking to the future in seeking to establish a pair of
rare Siberian Cranes Grus leucogeranus at Chester. After several years
without breeding we are happy to again report breeding West African
Crowned Cranes Balearica pavonina pavonina. Two chicks were hatched
and foster-reared by bantams in 1996. Because of our past experience of
sibling aggression between recently hatched chicks, each crane was hatched
under its own bantam foster mother. When the oldest chick was 17 days

enclosure along with their bantam fosters. This proved successful and
after another month the bantams were removed.
The Sun Bitterns Eurypyga helias built a superb nest and despite the
fact that both birds are believed to be over 25 years old, eggs were laid.
However, despite calcium supplementation all were soft-shelled. New
research on Little Black Bustards (Korhaan) Eupodotis afra has indicated
that the white-winged form, previously considered a race, should now be
treated as a full species, the White-winged Black Korhaan Eupodotis
afraoides. Although we had fertile eggs at Chester in 1996, none hatched
and our male died in the winter. We now have two females, mother and
daughter, and would like to hear from anyone who could offer a male,
perhaps in exchange for one of the females.
Crowned Plovers Vanellus coronatus again reared chicks. We are
grateful to Raymond Sawyer for the pair of Masked Lapwings and to Dr
Martin Bourne for a pair of Blacksmith Plovers Vanellus armatus. The
Masked Lapwings now grace the floor of the aviary holding one of our
pairs of Tawny Frogmouths Podargus strigoides. Although four Tawny
Frogmouth chicks were hand-reared in 1995, only one chick was hatched
in 1996 and this failed to survive. Two White-faced Scops Owls Otus
leucotis, two Spectacled Owls Pulsatrix perspicillata , three Snowy Owls
Nyctea scandiaca and five Barn Owls Tyto alba were reared. After several
years with no sign of breeding from our Great Grey Owls Strix nebulosa it
was decided to have these surgically sexed. Our 'pair' proved to be two
females so we are now looking to exchange one of these for a male. The
Ferruginous Pygmy Owls Glaucidium brasilianum laid fertile eggs but no
chicks were hatched.
Our pair of Congo Peafowl Afropavo congensis laid four clutches in
1996. The first two clutches were taken for artificial incubation. One
chick hatched from the first clutch but died at three days old. Two chicks
which hatched from the second clutch were fostered to a bantam and one
was successfully reared. Three chicks were hatched from the third clutch
under their natural parents but none survived. A fourth clutch was hatched
under a bantam in November and these have been photographed each week
in order to provide a photographic record that may assist the ageing of wild
chicks by field researchers in Zaire.
One Edwards' Pheasant Lophura edwardsi and three Satyr Tragopans
Tragopan satyra were parent-reared. A further three Satyr Tragopans, six
Golden Pheasants Chrysolophus pictus , a Red-legged Partridge Alectoris
rufa and a Bare-faced Curassow Crax fasciolata were reared by hand or
under fosters. Grey-headed Chachalacas Ortalis cinereiceps hatched a chick
in the free-flight area of the Tropical House but this was not reared. Blyth's
Tragopan Tragopan blythii and Mountain Peacock Pheasants Polyplectron
inopinatum laid for the first time but neither hatched chicks.

Every breeding season begins with high expectations further heightened
when courtship and nest-building are seen. Such highs are always followed
by lows when either eggs are not laid, eggs prove infertile or fail to hatch
or chicks hatch but die during rearing. We came close to breeding from
our pair of Blue Crowned Pigeons Goura cristata when a chick hatched in
the incubator and fostered under Java Doves Streptopelia risoria survived
for five days but died before we were due to switch it to a commercial hand-
rearing diet. We artificially incubated and subsequently hand-reared a
Nicobar Pigeon Caloenas nicobarica. This was the first pigeon we have
successfully hand-reared from hatching. Not all our hand-rearing was
successful however, a Scarlet Ibis Eudocimus ruber chick (the first to be
hatched at Chester) was lost at three days old.
Fourteen Waldrapp Ibis Geronticus eremita were parent-reared.
However, we are still trying to determine the conditions necessary for our
Humboldt's Penguins to consistently parent-rear. Only two of 12 chicks
hatched in July and left under their parents were reared to independence
whilst of 23 taken for hand-rearing in April and May, all were reared
successfully. Two pairs of penguins laid repeat clutches in November, of
these to date, four have hatched (and been left with their parents) bringing
the number of hatchings this year to a record 39. Twenty youngsters have
already travelled to Jurques, France, to establish a new zoo colony. However,
again success has bred its own problems arid it has been suggested that
Chester's penguins are now over-represented in other zoos. As such it is
likely that for 1997 at least our policy will be to only rear chicks under
their parents. Hopefully we may obtain some under-represented genetically
important stock from elsewhere and then concentrate our efforts on breeding
from them.
Six Caribbean Flamingos Phoenicopterus ruber ruber and three Chilean
Flamingos Phoenicopterus chilensis were reared successfully in 1996. Since
1990 our Chilean flock has increased by breeding from 28 to the present
42. Over the same period the Caribbean flock has increased from 42 to 55.
In that time totals of 21 Chilean and 28 Caribbean Flamingos have been
reared at Chester but the recent higher adult mortality of the Caribbean
Flamingos has counter-balanced their greater birth rate.
Hawaiian Geese Branta sandvicensis , Red-breasted Geese Branta
ruficollis and Emperor Geese Anser canagicus were all allowed to rear
their own youngsters. Other successful waterfowl breedings included Black-

Chester achieved the first UK breeding of the Pied Imperial Pigeon
Ducula bicolor in 1964 but breeding was not repeated at Chester again
until this year when two chicks were reared by one of two pairs in the free
flight area of the Tropical House. The parents were bred at Paignton Zoo
and had made numerous unsuccessful attempts at breeding since their arrival
at Chester in 1991.
Other pigeons bred included Speckled Pigeons Columba guinea , Rock
Doves Columba livia , Crested Bronzewings Ocyphaps lophotes. Common
Bronzewings Phaps chalcoptera and Diamond Doves Geopelia cuneata.
Luzon Bleeding Heart Pigeons Gallicolumba luzonica and Superb Fruit
Doves Ptilinopus superbus hatched chicks but this year none were reared
successfully.
Three Blue-eyed Cockatoos Cacatua ophthalmica were hand-reared and
a fourth parent-reared. Vogelpark Walsrode now joins Rotterdam Zoo,
Paignton, Paradise Park, Tierpark Berlin and Loro Parque as collections
receiving birds from Chester to assist the European Studbook programme
for this rare cockatoo. We were fortunate to be able to exchange one of our
male White-tailed Black Cockatoos Calyptorhynchus latirostris for a female
from Rotterdam Zoo. Although not as colourful as the Red-tailed Black
Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus magnificus we made the decision to favour
latrirostris in that the latter is presently of greater conservation concern.
Calyptorhynchus latirostris , recently upgraded from a race of
Calyptorhynchus funereus to a species in its own right, has given us
considerable naming problems. Although latirostris and funereus are still
popularly grouped together as White-tailed Black Cockatoos, the most recent
Birdlife International checklist of endangered birds refers to latirostris as
the Slender-billed Black Cockatoo, restricting the name White-tailed Black
Cockatoo to the closely related baudinii. This has caused some confusion;
latirostris has a stumpier bill than baudinii and is also referred to as the
Short-billed Black Cockatoo or Carnaby's Black Cockatoo. Hopefully these
name changes will soon be sorted out but until then it is safest to always
use the scientific name when referring to these black cockatoos.
We were very sad to lose our male Palm Cockatoo in 1996 and are
currently seeking a new partner to join the female which showed every
sign of breeding, spending lengthy periods in the nest until the death of her
partner. A mate has now been found for our female Red-vented Cockatoo
Cacatua haematuropygia and other new arrivals include a female Kea
Nestor notabilis from New Zealand. This bird formed part of a group
recently imported into the UK thanks to negotiations by the European
Studbook Keeper at Bristol Zoo. Our previous female was earlier in the
year moved to Bristol's Kea colony where she was delighted to re-encounter
her previous mate. Partner choice is important in birds and lovelorn parrots
can stubbornly ignore the choices made for them by breeding programme

computer dating. Red-fronted Macaws Am rubrogenys again reared five
chicks in a single brood and one Blue and Yellow Macaw Am aramuna
was bred. Two Thick-billed Parrots Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha and a
Yellow-naped Macaw Am auricollis were hatched but unfortunately were
not reared. We were more successful in breeding two Blue-throated Conures
Pyrrhura cruentata , four Slender-billed Parrakeets Enicognathus
leptorhynchus , three Derbyan Parrakeets Psittacula derbiana , three Greater
Vasa Parrots Coracopsis vasa and one Eclectus Parrot Eclectus roratus
vosmaeri. Lories presented a particular problem in 1996 in that most were
either not in pairs or in recently established pairs. We have recently received
two Mount Apo Lorikeets Trichoglossus johnstoniae and are looking
forward to working with this species in 1997.
Four species of touraco are held at Chester and all four were bred in
1996. Two White-cheeked Touracos Tauraco leucotis and two Violaceous
Touracos Musophaga violacea were parent-reared and two Red-crested
Touracos Tauraco erythrolophus and one Schalow's Touraco Tauraco
schalowi hand-reared. Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator again
reared two chicks to make a total of 17 youngsters reared by this pair since
their first breeding in 1989. However the African Grey Hornbills Tockus
nasutus epirhinus which had been so successful in previous years, this year
failed to rear chicks from two nesting attempts. The Great Indian Hornbills
Buceros bicornis again nested unsuccessfully and at the end of the year a
new female, on loan from Avifauna (Holland) was received and has been
introduced to the male. The re-pairing of the Rhinoceros Hornbills Buceros
rhinoceros in 1995 did not lead to any breeding attempts in 1996 but we
remain hopeful for 1997. Last but not least the Wrinkled Hornbills Aceros
corrugatus reared one youngster in 1996. Nearly six months after fledging
this is still being fed by both parents and has not shown any inclination to
become independent.
Lilac-breasted Rollers Coracias caudata were bred for the first time at
Chester in 1996. Four chicks were reared but the female parent killed the
male shortly before the chicks fledged. She then continued to rear the
chicks and showed no aggression towards the Congo Peafowl sharing the
aviary. Red-billed Blue Magpies Urocissa erythrorhyncha reared their own
chicks but although eggs were laid no Choughs Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax
or Azure-winged Magpies Cyanopica cyana were reared.
Superb Starlings Spreo superbus and Asian Glossy Starlings Aplonis
panayensis reared chicks and one Royal or Golden-breasted Starling
Cosmopsarus regius was successfully hand-reared. Ten Bali Starlings
Leucopsar rothschildi were bred from one pair by a combination of parent
and hand-rearing. After several years of unsuccessful breeding attempts
by the Yellow-throated Laughing Thrushes Garrulax galbanus it was
decided to remove eggs for artificial incubation and attempt hand-rearing.

This proved successful with three chicks being hand-reared from the eggs.
Other softbills bred in 1996 include Plumbeous Redstarts Phoenicurus
fuliginosus, White-ramped Shamas Copsychus malabaricus and Pekin
Robins Leiofhrix lutea. We have small groups of both Pekin Robins and
Silver-eared Mesias Leiothrix argentauris in the tree-flight of the Tropical
House and were surprised when the chick reared by the mesias proved to be
a hybrid between these two species. No breeding association was noted
between Silver-eared Mesias and Pekin Robins and only mesias fed the
hybrid chick.
Mexican House Finches Carpodacus mexicanus again reared youngsters
in the finch flight but although Gouldian Finches Chloebia gouldiae and
Cordon Bleus JJraeginthus bengalus both hatched chicks none were reared.
Two Java Sparrows Padda oryzivora fledged in the Tropical House at the
year end. It may come as a surprise that the Java Sparrow Padda oryzivora
is now listed as a threatened species. Massive population declines in
Indonesia have been attributed to over-exploitation for the cage bird trade.
Hopefully their wild populations may recover with the reduction in trade of
wild caught birds which captive breeding should be encouraged to replace.

Three species bred at the zoo for the first time in 1996: Black-faced Ibis
Theristicus melanopis, White Woodpecker Melanerpes Candidas and
Rothschild's Mynah Leucopsar rothschildi , a species which has been in
the collection since 1982. A Red-billed Hornbill Tockus erythrorhynchus
was hatched and hand-reared, and has now joined the zoo's Events Team.
The waterfowl collection has been revised and widespread Eurasian
species have been replaced with threatened ones such as Marbled Duck
Marmaronetta angustirostris and Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca.
A major new exhibit due to open in May 1997 will be on the Mappin

THE SOCIETY'S VISIT TO FLAMINGO GARDENS AND
ZOOLOGICAL PARK

On Saturday 21st September, the Avicultural Society visited Flamingo
Gardens and Zoological Park at Weston Underwood, Nr. Olney, Bucks. It
was the Society's first visit to the park, which is owned by Christopher
Marler, who was recently elected a Vice President of the Avicultural Society.
It was a beautiful early autumn day and with almost 50 members and friends
in attendance, it was obvious that those present appreciated visiting this
venue.
In recent years small portable metal aviaries have appeared on the market
and these house an expanding collection of Australian parrakeets, lovebirds
and Ring-neck mutations, including a beautiful flock of 15 lutino Ring-
necks. The wall aviaries house the softbill collection, with many interesting
species, including Royal or Golden-breasted, Emerald and Long-tailed
Starlings, White-crested, Red-winged and Black-throated Laughing
Thrushes, touracos and toucans. Christopher Marler showed us around
and pointed out the various exhibits and told us many interesting little
stories concerning them. The striking American Bald Eagle was a centre
of attention and he proudly explained that 17 young have been parent-
reared since he achieved the UK first breeding with this species in 1986.
The park is home to the Pelican Trust and the collection includes two
beautiful groups of White and Pink-backed Pelicans kept full-winged in
100ft x 12ft high (approx. 30.8m x 3.7m) aviaries and are seen at their best
when having the freedom to fly. The breeding group of Greater Flamingos
was also admired. The waterfowl collection which is known the world
over, has many unusual breedings to its credit and has always held centre
stage in this varied collection. The park is also home to a large number of
peafowl and varieties of domesticated poultry. Although birds form the
bulk of the collection, there is also a number of impressive animals, including
American Bison, Congo Buffalo, Yak and white wallabies.
Members were honoured and privileged to be allowed to see Christopher
Marler's private museum and art gallery. The pictures are mainly originals
and generally of birds. Christopher has had mounted several of the choice
birds which he has kept over the years. These include both Scarlet and
Orange Cocks-of-the-Rock, three Royal or Golden-breasted Starlings,
Azure-winged Magpies and a selection of parrots. There are also two small
glass cases, one of which contains among other species, a Lesser Bird of
Paradise and the other a collection of choice South American nectar-feeders
and softbills. Most imposing is a third cabinet, which came from a private
house and must be over 125 years old. This houses all the British gamebirds
of the 19th century - and a Bob White Quail!

Anyone with an interest in the Lonchura will, I am sure, have been
aware for sometime that Robin Restall was in the process of writing a book
on these birds. That publication was eagerly awaited is something of an
understatement as of all of the titles published during the past few years,
Robin Restall's book has to be one of the titles I, as a bookseller, have
received the most enquiries regarding its publication date. It appears it
took the author five years to write the book. When one takes into account
the wealth of detail included in the text and that he also illustrated the
book, I am not in the least surprised that it took the time it did to complete.
The actual title is in fact Munias and Mannikins and it is published by
Pica Press at #28.00. There are some 264 pages with 16 coloured plates at
the front of the book and 64 plates at the rear. The 16 plates are of perched
birds painted in 'field guide' style, depicting every known plumage. For
quick easy identification purposes, these plates are ideal, showing details
of adult and immature plumage and in certain cases, first-year plumage
also, of all known species and races. The 64 colour plates (at the rear of
the book) are measured drawings of individual birds showing plumage
differences. The detail in these plates is outstanding and each plate will, I
am sure, be pored over time and time again by Lonchura enthusiasts. The
numerous line drawings found throughout the text are a delight. Indeed I
find them as interesting as the colour plates. Many of these drawings show
behaviour patterns never before illustrated or described. Distribution maps
are also included.
The detailed text (for each species and race) includes field characters,
status (in the wild), habitat, habits and behaviour, food and feeding, call-
notes, song, courtship and display, breeding, conservation (where applicable)
and descriptions of adult males and females, plus notes on juvenile plumage.
In the chapter Natural History of Munias and Mannikins, the author gives
a brief overall view of the genus Lonchura. When discussing the nesting
habits of these birds, Goodwin (in Estrildid Finches of the World , 1982) is
quoted as offering the hypothesis than many estrildids not presently known
to do so, may occasionally make use of other species' nests, The author
mentions that he personally has found only one example of this practice,
namely in Bali where the White-headed MuniaL. maja had taken possession
of the nest of a Streaked Weaver Ploceus manyar. Van Someren (1956) in
Days with Birds - studies of habits of some East African species , described
how the Rufous-backed Mannikin L. bicolor nigriceps takes over old weaver
nests in which to roost. Van Someren also described how Silverbills L.
cantans will take over old weaver nests and rear young in them.

It is obvious that Robin's book will remain the definite work on the
Lonchura for many years to come. Indeed I cannot see it ever being
superseded. With such a wealth of detail, it would no doubt prove difficult
to even find new information for a second edition.
For anyone with an interest in munias and mannikins, the book is a
must. The information (both in the plates and the text) on the many races
will prove invaluable to the aviculturist who wishes to identify the birds in
his or her possession and will hopefully enable many breeders to pair like
to like. For those who import Lonchura species, the book provides all the
information required for correct identification.

This must be the book for all wishful 'Grus gurus', concerned for crane
care and with their propagation in captivity. Though published and printed
in 1996, it is of interest to the reviewer to note that the Foreword was
written by Sir Peter Scott, way back in 1988: he died in 1989. One cannot
help but wonder how much of the contents he saw before agreeing to the
use of his name!
However, little appears to have been lost by this delay; it just emphasises
the time it takes to assemble people and material to put together a book of
this kind. Included is information on topics such as reproduction physiology,
artificial insemination, incubation, rearing and behaviour management, as
well as essential priorities for the long term, including genetic management
and record keeping. Not that its interest is exclusively on maintenance in
confinement; there are sections dealing with the status of all 15 species in
the wild, with useful distribution maps and interesting sections dealing
with re-introductions. There are 13 chapters which include Crane Biology,
through to Ecology, Status and Conservation.
However, this is a manual. With the names of staff and research officers
from Patuxent Wildlife Center and the International Crane Foundation,

Baraboo, Wisconsin to the fore, one is right to expect a wealth of well
recorded practical experience and research. It is tempting to pick the book
up and attempt a one sitting read, but that would be a mistake, there is too
much to digest.
Inevitably this production has an American bias. There appears to be
little reference to experience in Britain or continental Europe with the
exception of that at Walsrode. There are tables for example for ambient
temperatures at which warm climate cranes should be moved indoors and
supplied with supplemental heat. So, if you keep Sarus or Wattled Cranes,
they should be brought indoors at -20*C, and given heat at -30*C in the
case of the Sarus Crane, and at -40*C in the case of the Wattled Crane -
thank goodness for the equable British climate. Both species of Crowned
Crane are treated equally, with the recommendation that they are kept in
and given heat from 0*C, whereas we in Britain tend to give only Balearica
pavonina special consideration in winter.
The chapter on chick rearing includes much of use including the
mitigation of foot and toe deformities. New to me is the thought of exercising
chicks by swimming. Swimming, being less stressful to most chicks,
requires less time than walking for similar benefits. There are also some
useful observations which may have a practical application to even small
time keepers of cranes. It is generally acknowledged that for a pair of
cranes to be successful in breeding the male should be conspicuous by his
larger size and obvious dominance. Under &apos;Behaviour management' a tip
given for those who have a pair of cranes where the male is on the small
side and is deferential to his intended breeding partner is to build mounds
of earth on which he can stand - his dominance can thereby be increased.
There are useful appendices particularly the one on equipment, but again
it is mostly of American origin e.g. incubators, with no mention of two
well known British manufacturers, transponders, sexing labs, suppliers of
rings - sorry bands - in this case both North American and British.
'Cranes' will reside alongside my Walkinshaw, 1973 and Johnsgard,
1983. Though essentially an avicultural manual it complements and updates
my knowledge on the status and conservation of cranes worldwide too. It
is a most welcome addition to the book shelf of the zoo professional and
serious birdkeeper alike.

<bodyText confidence="0.994203933333333" page_id="56261131"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
The Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis has become the latest
endangered species to become the subject of an international studbook. A
petition to extend the existing European regional studbook was made
following the 1996 meeting of the Taxon Advisory Group for parrots at the
annual EAZA/EEP meeting held in France at the end of June. Currently a
regional studbook for Europe, coordinated by Loro Parque, has been run as
part of the EEP scheme for the Blue-throated Macaw. The application for
the international studbook was made jointly by Roger Sweeney, the Curator
at Loro Parque and Alan Hesse, the biologist coordinating the current field
conservation work for this species in Bolivia. The application received
official endorsement by both the IUCN/SSC and the IUDZG-WZO. Every
aviculturist who keeps this species should ensure that their birds are
registered, so that for the first time a clear idea can be obtained of the true
status of the Blue-throated Macaw in captivity. It is feared that the wild
population may now number only 100 birds or less.

<bodyText confidence="0.99832975" page_id="56261131"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
Following his successes with the Pink-throated Twinspot Hypargos
margaritatus and the Grey-headed Olive-back Nesocharis capistrata , Chris
Koen has now succeeded in breeding the Long-tailed Rosefinch Uragus
sibiricus. The pair showed no interest in breeding when kept in an aviary
with various similar sized finches. It was not until they were moved to a
large cage that they nested. Their first attempt was unsuccessful, but three
months later, from a clutch of four eggs, one youngster was raised. The
incubation and fledging periods were both 13 days.

BIRD WORLD HAS NEW OWNERS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.978246555555556" page_id="56261131"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
Birdworld at Farnham, Surrey, has new owners. Opened to the public
15th June 1968, it was for the following 28 years up until the time of the
sale run very successfully by the Harvey family. The bird collection and
the 28 acre site have been bought by Denys E. Head Ltd., a family company
which owns the garden centre adjacent to Birdworld. Mr Roger Head, the
company's managing director was quoted as saying: 'We plan to continue
developing Birdworld as the most prestigious bird park in the country.'
Rob Harvey will have a continuing involvement with Birdworld in a
consultative capacity.

TRACKING BUSTARDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993546222222222" page_id="56261132"  page_num="185" year="" vol="">
Cooperation between the United Arab Emirates and Kenya and Tanzania
will help provide a valuable insight into the habits of two species of East
African bustards, closely related to the Houbara Bustard Chlamydotis
undulata , the traditional quarry of Arab falconers.
Following a visit to East Africa by members of the National Avian
Research Centre (NARC), a project is underway to track Kori Bustards
Ardeotis kori in Kenya, and plans are being made for a study of Denham's
Bustard Neotis denhami jacksoni in Tanzania.
Two Kori Bustards captured and fitted with satellite tags during the
visit to Kenya are being tracked by the NARC in Abu Dhabi, and information
about their movements is being relayed back to the National Museum of
Kenya. The birds were netted at night after being dazzled with a powerful
spotlight, and the opportunity was also taken to collect blood samples which
are being analyzed by NARC staff in the UAE.
Following the work in Kenya, Professor John Cooper, Programme
Director at the NARC (and a member of the Avicultural Society), went to
Tanzania for talks with wildlife organisations and the universities at Dar
es Salaam and Sokoine. It is hoped that a six month pilot study into the
status of Denham's Bustard will result from the talks and that, as in Kenya,
the work will be a collaboration between the NARC and local institutions
and individuals.
Proposals to establish links between the NARC and East Africa were
first made two years ago, and aimed at using the NARC's expertise at
satellite tracking to monitor movements of Kori Bustards in the great Rift
Valley of East Africa. Battery-powered transmitters are attached to the
backs of birds and the information collected by satellite yields valuable
data about their migration and breeding patterns.

ALF 'TIMBER' WOODS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9915254" page_id="56261133"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
News of the death of Alf Woods on 26th August 1994 was, perhaps as a
result of an oversight, not included in the staff obituaries in the Zoological
Society of London Annual Report for that year. As a result his death passed
unnoticed by his former colleagues and older members of the bird keeping
fraternity who remember him. His death came to notice earlier this year
because it was thought that he was about to celebrate his 90th birthday. It
would also have been 40 years since he retired from the zoo in 1956 - on
the grounds of ill health. Prior to his retirement, 'Timber' as he was almost
universally known, was Head Keeper of the Bird House. In 1954, he
participated in the 'Zoo Quest to Sierra Leone', and hand-reared the first
White-necked Picathartes or Guinea Rockfowl Picathartes gymnocephalus
ever brought alive to Europe. He will also be remembered for allowing
'Baby', the famous Great Indian Hornbill Buceros bicornis , which lived in
the Bird House for 32 years, to perch on his arm and gently take a grape
from between his teeth.

NEW ACCOMMODATION AT LORO PARQUE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99697230952381" page_id="56261134"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
In recent years the exhibition area at Loro Parque has seen an extensive
modernisation of the aviary accommodation housing the world&apos;s most
complete collection of parrots, which now has more than one million visitors
each year.
In 1993, all of the Amazona species together with the Pesquefs Parrots
Psittrichas fulgidus and Hawk-headed Parrots Deroptyus accipitrinus were
provided with new larger cages of an improved design. The following year
was one of rapid development and saw several more areas of aviaries rebuilt,
with the Pionus parrots, caiques ( Pionites ssp.), Aratinga conures and
cockatoos all rehoused before the III International Parrot Convention was
hosted at Loro Parque in September of that year. Further work continued
in 1995, when the Brotogeris parrakeets, Enicognathus conures, Thick-
billed Parrots ( Rhynchopsitta sp.) and all the smaller macaws were provided
with new aviary accommodation.
In 1996, the Asian parrots and parrakeets were relocated on land
leading to the Dolphinarium. This included the fig parrots, Psittacula
parrakeets, Tanygnathus parrots and shining parrots ( Prosopeia spp.). Other
building work in 1996 has been largely dominated by the construction of
the new breeding station on a plot of land situated some distance from Loro
Parque, which was purchased and donated to the Loro Parque Foundation.
This new breeding area will initially have about 350 breeding cages, ranging
in length from 3m (9ft 9in) to 12m (39ft), and will be the first phase of the
plan to relocate the majority of the breeding station to this new site, thereby
allowing future expansion of the public area of Loro Parque.
With the breeding station nearing completion, the time has again come
to move forward with the modernisation of the public area of the bird
collection, this time concentrating on the collection of Australian parrakeets.
The new development will provide 26 aviaries to display a variety of
Neophema, Psephotus, Platycerus, Polytelis, Barnardius, Aprosmictus,
Alisterus and Purpureicephalus species. These new aviaries will be situated
on the site of the old aviaries and an adjoining area not previously utilised.
Work should begin in late November and be completed before the end of
1996, thereby providing the collection of Australian parrakeets with new
accommodation before the start of the 1997 breeding season.
As with all the redevelopment of aviary accommodation which has
taken place in recent years, the building of the new aviaries for the Australian
parrakeets is designed to provide them with more flying space, more sunlight
and a quieter environment, and with rows of plants between the aviaries.
Plans are also in the pipeline to rehouse the African species and for a large
aviary for Keas. The aim is to maintain the high standards at Loro Parque
and to provide visitors with as complete an insight as possible into the
Parrot family.

Robin Restall, author and illustrator of the recently published Munias
and Mannikins, reviewed in this magazine, is now working on two new
books, also to be published by Pica Press in the UK and Yale University
Press in the USA. The first will cover the New World sub-family Cardinalinae,
that is the cardinals, saltators, grosbeaks and Passerina buntings. The second
will cover a group of New World emberizids, Sporophila, Oryzoborus,
Catamenia, Tiaris, Loxigilla and Loxipasser. These handbooks will contains
as much original personal observations (written and illustrated) as possible,
and, like the munias book will show every known plumage in colour. This
means adult males of every race, and females, immatures and moults where
distinct. There will also be a set of measured drawings of many individual
birds. The distribution maps will show political boundaries, major river
systems and probably key elevations.
Robin lives in Caracas where he has a large garden aviary and a small
outdoor birdroom. He has a few Sporophila and Oryzoborus at the present,
and is travelling extensively to make comparative field observations about
these birds, many of which occur in Venezuela.
He would very much like to build a network of people interested in any
of the species that are in the two groups described above, to exchange
experiences, news and views. If you have seen Munias and Mannikins, you
will understand how avicultural experience can provide invaluable insights
into behaviour, and thus contribute to and enrich a handbook on birds. Every
correspondent will be respected, and every contribution will be fully
acknowledged in the printed work. Any aviculturist who corresponded with
Robin during the development of the munias book will vouch for the fact
that this is a give and take offer.
