Iii presenting the tenth annual volume of the Avicultural
Magazine, the second of the new series, it is with much satis-
faction, mingled with a feeling of relief, that we are able to
announce that, in spite of many difficulties, the high standard
attained in the last volume, lias been maintained in the present
one.
It was found that the funds of the Society did not admit
of our giving a coloured plate with each monthly number,
unless we reduced the quality of the illustrations, which we
considered most undesirable. We have therefore issued eight
coloured plates, and all have been of the highest quality. Our
artists, Messrs. Gronvold and Goodchild, have admirably
accomplished the work entrusted to them.
Besides the coloured plates several good black and white
ones have been published, and no monthly number has been
without at least one good plate, coloured or otherwise. Messrs.
Newman and Meade-Waldo very kindly defrayed the entire
cost of the plates which accompanied their respective articles
in the April and July numbers.
As regards the coloured plates for the next volume, we
have invited members to suggest suitable subjects, and several
good suggestions have been received, which are being carefully
considered by the Executive Committee.
Some sixty new members have joined the Society this
year, and our membership is now above four hundred; so that
in spite of some having deserted us, we may say that our Society
is very flourishing.
This year we have had the pleasure of electing as an
Honorary Member Dr. F. DuCane Godman, D.C.L., F.R.S.,
F.Z.S., &amp;c., President of the British Ornithologist's Union, whose
devotion to ornithology is well known.
New members have joined us from India, the Argentine
Republic, New Zealand, and other distant parts, so that our

connection with abroad is well kept up; while members of older
standing, who have returned from abroad, have contributed
articles relating their experiences.
Last April we had to announce, with much regret the
resignation of Mr. Reginald Phieeipps from the &quot;post of
Honorary Business Secretary, which he had most ably held.
He has been one of the chief helpers of the Society since it
commenced its career ten years ago, both by his literary and
pecuniary contributions. We hope that we may soon have some
more of his very interesting and instructive articles in our
agazine. The office of Hon. Business Secretary has been filled
by Mr. T. H. Newman, F.Z.S.
At the Animal Meeting of the Council, held in June it
was found necessary to revise the Rules, which were thought'to
be inadequate to the present state of the Societv, The matter
was very carefully considered, and we believe that as amended
they will tend towards better and smoother working of the
Society than heretofore.
The sale of the Magazine to non-members for the past
year compares favourably with other years, and our Publisher
who is responsible for all numbers sold to the outside public'
. COntmUeS ' both by bri "g&amp;gt;ng the Magazine before the general
notice, and by ably managing all such other business as falls to
e lot of a Publisher, to be of great service to the Society.
The finances of the Society have this year caused some
anxiety owing to our desire to keep the present volume up to
e highest standard. In order to prevent a serious deficit we
decided, as before mentioned, to have only eight coloured plates
year and to start a fund to help towards the illustrations,
ii** fUnd baS beeu most generously supported, and up to the
moment of writing ^28 10s. 6d. has been received. We take
this opportunity of heartily thanking those members whose
liberality has set the Society once more on a firm financial basis
and who have shown by their ready response that they have the
welfare of the Society at heart. We hope that next year bv
increase of our membership, the financial position of our Society
may be placed on an even firmer footing ; and we would ask all

Report of the Council.
our members to do their best to make the Magazine known, and
to introduce new members.
The past summer has been an exceedingly genial one, and
we are not surprised to note that several of our members have
done well in breeding rare and interesting birds in their aviaries.
A word of especial praise is due to our esteemed Honorary Mem-
ber, Dr. Albert Gunther, M.D., Pli.D., F.R.S., &amp;c.. for having
succeeded in breeding the Red-backed Shrike. We believe that
there is still a considerable field for study offered by the more
interesting British and European birds, which are liable to be
somewhat neglected on account of the very proper desire to keep
the less known foreigners. At the time of writing we hear that
Mrs. Johnstone has a fine young Touracou, which is being most
carefully tended by its parents, and we look forward with pleasure
to the article which is shortly to appear on the subject in our
pages.
Finally, we would sincerely thank all those members,
whether officers or otherwise, who have worked so well for the
Society and its Magazine ; we are especially indebted to Mr.
Arthur Gill for his kindness in giving Post mortem reports,
and in handing over, for the benefit of the Society, the fees he
receives for sending replies by post.

are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such

Unless the candidate shall, within two weeks after the publication of his

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996206631578948" page_id="32958586"  page_num="Page 18" year="" vol="">
The Medal may be awarded, at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account to the Business Secretary, for publica-
tion in the Magazine, within about eight weeks from the date of the hatching
of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where
the young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly
independent of their parents.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full, so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of award-
ing the Medal is under consideration.
The parents of the young must be tli ebona fide property of the breeder.
Any evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only disqualify the
breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance, but will
seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently advance
for the breeding of the same or other species.
In every case, the decision of the Committee shall be final.
Tbe Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as circumstances will permit.
The Medal is struck in bronze, and measures 2J inches in diameter.
It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing
e gg s , and the words " The Avicultural Society--Founded 1S94." On the
reverse is the following inscription : " Awarded to (name of donee) for
rearing young of (name of species) a species not previously bred in captivity
in the United Kingdom.

THE RUFOUS-BELLIED NILTAVA.
Niltava sundara.
Ey Russell Humphrys.
In the Avicultural Magazine for November, 1902, a short
account was published of the male bird, illustrated in this
month's number. Privately imported by one of our members,
it came into my possession in the early summer of last year, and
has, up to the present time, always been the picture of health
and condition.
Although it is always difficult to draw definite conclusions
from one example, it seems obvious that Niltava sundara is not a
particularly delicate cage bird. In comparison with our British
Flycatchers it is practically hardy. During the recent summer,
the subject of Mr. Grouvold's beautiful plate has been placed
outdoors all day, and has, during that time, successfully accom-
plished his second moult without the least apparent incon-
venience. The moult has each year been completed by the end
of July, and the bird in song again during August.
In the previous article published it was stated that Niltava
sundara warbled agreeably, reminding the writer forcibly of the
Red-backed Shrike; this has been subsequently confirmed,
although perhaps the notes of the former bird are stronger and
more varied. A voracious appetite for soft fruit and a marked
partiality for all live insects are the chief characteristics of his
diet.

NESTING OF THE WAXWING IN CONFINEMENT.

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The Waxwing (.Ampelis garrulus ) has always been a
favourite of mine, although, until I discarded all food of a
farinaceous nature from it's diet, I never succeeded in keeping
this bird long in satisfactory health. That I have now hit off a
suitable regime is I think proved by the fact that I have, in a
garden aviary, a pair of Waxwings in splendid order, which have
twice hatched young this last summer.
So much interest has always attached to the breeding
habits of this charming inhabitant of northern forest lands, and
so much mystery, until Mr. Wolley's discovery,* that I may
perhaps be pardoned for describing in some detail my birds'
operations, even though under very artificial conditions.
On May 24th, I first noticed these two birds feeding each
other (or rather the one which afterwards turned out to be the
cock feeding his companion), and going through other perfor-
mances suggestive of a wish to go to nest. I did not take this
very seriously until I found that they were driving some other
individuals of the same species, and showing so much excitement
that I nailed the head of a spruce tree to one side of the aviary,
and suspended an orchid basket dressed with yew twigs from the
roof, supplying such materials as are said to be used by the wild
bird, except that at that time I had not any of the long tree
lichen, or Old Man's Beard, a supply of which arrived from
Scotland too late to be of any service.
To my delight 011 June 16th, I saw one of the Waxwings
go into the swinging basket, and, by moving its body and wings,
shape a hollow, as if for a nest. The other three birds were
looking scared, and sitting on a low branch near the ground,
so we removed them.
Next day the pair had carried material (grass bents) into
the basket, and the nest looked more compact, and had assumed
a more definite shape. This went on for the next few days, the

birds becoming exceedingly bold and tame, and by the 22nd the
nest was apparently complete, a considerable amount of pieces
of dried shepherd's purse, chickweed, fine rootlets, and dead grass
having been accumulated, and a lining made of feathers and
rabbit's fur.
I should add that by this time we had seen the birds pair
more than once, and were able to say for certain that one which
had been badly mauled by a brown owl through the wires of the
aviary, and still carried a mark where the feathers were perman-
ently disarranged, was the female.
The male's " show" was all this time very beautiful. With
crest fully erect, and wings and tail spread and drooping, he
would hop round his mate as she sat crouching on a branch with
a mealworm in his beak, as it were tantalising her, and exhibit-
ing his lovely plumage to the best advantage, before he dropped
the gift into her expectant mouth. The notes of the birds did
not differ during the nesting period from the ordinary twitter
heard at other times.
On the 23rd of June a high wind, from an unusual quarter,
spun the hanging basket round, and seemed to upset the birds ;
for they transferred their attentions to the spruce tree, into which
we fixed a Mistle Thrush's nest as soon as we saw that they were
neglecting the first nest. On 27th they were lining the Thrush's
nest with feathers. We then ventured to examine the nest in the
basket by means of a small mirror fastened to a stick, and to
everybody's huge delight a beautiful egg was seen. I need not
say how carefully this was blown, and it was immediately
sent up to our Hon. Secretary for inspection, who had all along
showed much kind, interest in my birds' proceedings.
On the 28th in the early morning the male was sitting in the
nest, and this was the only occasion when we saw him there. On
the 30th June the hen began to sit steadily. On that day I saw
her, after chasing the male (for food ?) go on again, arranging
herself so that I felt sure that she had a clutch of eggs under her.
On the 14th of July the male was noticed to be very bold, and
excited, jealously driving off any other birds (Bearded Tits). O11
the next day young birds were seen being fed. The period of
incubation may therefore be taken as fourteen days.

Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
All went well for the first few days, from July 14th, the
hen (alone) taking mealworms out of the pan, killing them, and
presently disgorging them into the throats of the three young.
But, sad to say, on the 17th, a change took place. The parent,
instead of delivering partly-digested or crushed mealworms,
kept dropping freshly-killed ones into the mouths of the young,
which seemed unable to swallow them. They let the worm drop
into the bottom of the nest, whence the hen would pick it up,
and very patiently repeat the process eight or a dozen times
before she gave it up, and went off to the pan for a fresh supply,
only with the same result. Chopped mealworms, and selected
small ones, and some small caterpillars were provided, and were
taken up to the brood by the parent, but it was no good, they
were not swallowed. Meanwhile my man could see that the young
were getting visibly weaker. So, as the old birds were very tame,
he thought the only chance was to give them a little help by
hand. At intervals of an hour he offered them fresh ants' eggs,
fresh egg yolk, scalded sultana raisins, but chiefly soft white
mealworms that had just changed their skins. But there was
great difficulty in getting the nestings to swallow even the
smallest morsel; and, when they did get anything down, it was
nearly always thrown up again.
On the 18th, the little ones were dead, and there was a
clear egg left besides, making up the usual clutch of five,
(counting the egg left in the first nest).
The throats of the young after death seemed swollen, and
slightly inflamed. What can have caused this I cannot imagine.
It is true that on the day on which the young were first seen to be
amiss the heat was great (max. in shade 75 degs.) And as the
nest was within a couple of feet of the glass roof, the hen bird
felt it much, for she brooded the young with her mouth open.
But I cannot think that excessive heat alone, all the surround-
ings being perfectly sweet and wholesome, could induce an
inflammatory throat affection. However, as a precaution, the
glass over the nest was removed, and some perforated zinc put
in its place.
Five days after the dead bodies of the little birds were

removed the pair relined the nest; and on the 25th July the hen
was sitting again on three eggs. Perhaps the strain upon the
birds of the second nest so late in the season, and when the
monlt was due, was too much ; for only one young one was
hatched this time, the other two young dying, after chipping the
shells. On the evening of the same day my man, having reason
to think that the young bird was not being fed, removed it and
placed it under the care of a Yellow-Hammer, which he happened
to know was just hatching. Here it seemed to be doing satis-
factorily until Friday (it was hatched on Sunday August 9th),
when it was found to have swallowed a horsehair from the lining
of the nest. There were five inches within the body of the poor
little thing, and, though the hair was drawn out with all possible
-are, the operation was a severe one, for the hair (from the
ictiou of the gizzard ?) was twisted into a spiral, and came up
with difficulty. The nestling seemed much exhausted, and it is
tot to be wondered at that it was found dead next morning.
I am glad to say that the old birds have completed their
noult, and seem perfectly sound and well. I shall of course try
o alter their treatment somehow on the next occasion, if I am
ucky enough to have another nest.
I should have said that, perhaps stimulated by their com-
&amp;gt;anions' example, two of the other trio were seen feeding each
&amp;apos;ther, and also carrying nesting material; but, though we gave
hem every opportunity, nothing came of it in their case.
It is perhaps exceptionally interesting that, owing to the
light blemish above described, my female bird can always be
istinguished from her mate. Otherwise I confess that I can
\0x25A0*t see a *y difference either in the general plumage, or even
a the ornamental, waxen appendages, or golden feathertips,
&amp;apos;etween the two birds.

Aviculturists have hitherto enjoyed but few opportunities
of studying Birds of Paradise in captivit5 r : indeed the rare
occasions on which living specimens have arrived in Europe may
almost be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Many years ago two examples of the Lesser Bird of Paradise
(Paradisea minor) were brought home by Mr. A. R. Wallace.
The Twelve-wired species (Seleucides nigricans) has once been
exhibited at the Zoo, and the Great Bird of Paradise (P. apoda)
was represented there last summer. In 1901 I saw a fine adult

apoda in Liverpool, the only survivor of several which it had
been attempted to bring over. Abroad, a specimen of P. apoda
was exhibited in the Berlin Zoological Gardens in 1899. This
list is but a meagre one at best, so that the following notes on
the young P. minor living at Amsterdam may be interesting.
At the time of my visit the bird was apparently about
three years old, and was just completing moult. The head was
partly covered with minute prickly brownish feathers and partly
with pale creamy feathers of a velvety texture. There were no
long floating plumes springing from the sides of the body as in
the adult, but the long wire-like rectrices were already apparent
as two slender filaments in the centre of the tail. Since Birds
of Paradise are usually studied from dried skins only, it was
interesting to note the colour of the various structures during
life. The iris was pale gamboge yellow ; the beak and feet
leaden colour, the latter being faintly tinged with pink. The
tongue was also leaden colour and quadrifid (not bifid) at the tip,
each of the two rami into which it was split being themselves
also minutely bifurcated. The roof of the mouth and posterior
edge of the palate were beset with spiny elevations, probably to
assist the bird in holding its food.
This specimen was fond of basking in the sunshine like a
Glossy Starling and sat almost upright on its perch, with its head
turned to one side, and the wings extended and drooping as if to
present as large a surface as possible to the sun's rays. It was
very ill-tempered, and on being approached kept up a most dis-
agreeable croaking like a spoilt child that does not wish to be
meddled with. The Dutch keeper said that it had already been
three years at Amsterdam, so that its temper would probably
grow worse with age : it continued to make its unpleasant noise
almost the whole time that I stood by taking notes, and was
ready on the least provocation to recommence its efforts. The
bird appeared to be in excellent health. It was very fond of
mealworms, and was also fed on chopped hard-boiled egg,
grapes, carrots and dates.

Leptoptila jamaicensis.
By Miss R. Alderson.
(Continued from p. 397, Vol. 1 ., New SeriesJ.
Three days after the first young Violet Dove had left the
nest, the second one followed. For some hours it had been
getting restless, and late in the afternoon it descended in safety.
This second bird (which I take to be a hen) was smaller in size
than the first young bird, and whiter on the forehead. I had a
thick bed of straw put down in one corner of the aviary just
below the nest, and an L shaped piece of floor boarding 11
inches high enclosing it. This protection can be made in two
separate pieces, the ends shaped so that after being fitted
together they can be held by a single nail; made in this way, they
are more convenient for storing away in the winter. I find these
\0x25A0cribs splendid for keeping young birds in safety when they first
leave the nest. The cribs should be a good size, say 4ft. by 3^-ft.
For the further protection of the baby Violet Doves, I
also put an empty box in one corner of the crib with a small
doorway at one end. They were fond of retiring in here and
nestling in the hay inside, and by just raising the lid I could
always see if they were all right.
It is a good plan to always put a thick layer of straw
under a dove's nest directly the young birds have hatched. It
will be a great protection to them when they leave the nest, as,
if they fall heavily on to a hard floor on their first attempt to
venture out, it&amp;apos; may cause a broken leg or wing. During the
past summer, before I adopted this plan, I had a fine j^oung
Half-collared Turtle fatally injured in this way.
Photograph No. 1 (see last number) was taken when the two
young birds had just left the nest. Their colouring was as
follows :--Fyes brown ; forehead, throat and breast, whitish drab ;
back and wings chocolate brown, with chestnut spots on the
wings (like the spots on a Necklace Dove); under parts white;

on the Nesting of the White-fronted or Violet Dove. 29
outer feathers of tail white; remainder of tail grey brown ; legs
dirty flesh-coloured ; length between six and seven inches.
The old birds took the greatest care of their young ones,
and "Bessie" would sit on the straw in the sun with a baby
dove on each side of her. Strangely enough I don't remember
ever seeing the young birds being fed. The eldest I first noticed
pecking seed when it was a month old.
On July nth we had a most terrible storm with thunder,
lightning, and a torrent of heavy rain. I hurried down to the
aviary fearful for the safety of the young Violets, and to my
surprise found the young cock thoroughly enjoying himself and
spreading out one tiny wing to catch the rain. Both young
birds got very wet but took no harm.
The spots on the wings had almost disappeared by July
21st, and ten days earlier I had noticed the sheen coming on
the neck of the elder young one--and a few days later on the
second also. The violet patch also began to show, and by the
end of July there was not really very much difference between
the old and young birds.
The latter quickly learnt to come to me for bits of peanuts,
and were as fond of this dainty as their parents. It was by
using this inducement that I managed (on August 1st) to take
photograph No. 3. The bird in the foreground is "Narcissus,"
that 011 the right (and also in photograph No. 2) is the young
cock.
I find Doves, Quails, and even small birds delight in cut-up
peanuts, and I think they are a very wholesome addition to their
usual diet. I cut up my own nuts at first, but it took up a good
deal of time. Later I found they could be procured from
Messrs. Armitage, seed merchants, Nottingham, ready ground,
for 4/- per stone, carriage extra. I now buy the nuts by the
stone and use them regularly.
The Violet Doves nested again but failed to hatch their
eggs. I think the young ones were partly to blame as they
would keep returning to the nest. Since then the Doves have
again nested and had two eggs, but, as I am writing this from

home, I do not know how they have fared. * Both the old birds
are in fine condition, though their plumage has got a little worn
with both sitting on the nest together.
When pleased, the Violet Doves have a habit of raising their
wings and quivering them very rapidly: the young birds soon
learnt to do the same, and it was a pretty sight to see all four
birds with their wings in motion when I threw them down some
peanut.
Before I close I may just add how very useful I have found
Tibbs' Ouinella for young birds just out of the nest. Often when
they first come out they take a chill, which quickly changes to
internal inflammation ; the young one becomes very relaxed and
possibly lame in one leg, and if not seen to soon droops and
dies_for the parents will not tend an unhealthy bird ; I have also
found this remedy very effectual with other young birds. Full
directions are given with the medicine, and the birds do not
seem to mind drinking it. Though it is not well to handle
young birds, a careful watch should be kept on them when just
out of the nest, so that any mischief may be checked in time.

"Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,
Land of the mountain and the flood."
The lovers of our British wild birds who dwell in the
southern parts of our islands are probably well acquainted with
a number of species which come as visitors from Autumn to
early Spring, but which depart with the advent of the breeding
season and travel northward to regions where they bring up
their young. Some of these species push so far North, even into
unexplored regions around the Pole, that their nesting habits are
very imperfectly known or even entirely shrouded in mystery ;
* On returning home I found that the Doves hatched their eggs, but the young birds
soon died. My bird man tells me that they looked as though they had been crushed, so
possibly they were smothered by the old birds sitting together on them.--K. A.

but there are others which do not entirely desert the British
Islands, but leave some of their number in the North of Scotland
where they lay their eggs and rear their broods.
It was with the object of seeing some of these winter
visitors to the South in their Summer homes that my brother
and I journeyed northward last May to spend a fortnight's
holiday in Sutherland. When the long train journey was over
there were yet more than 20 miles to be covered by coach before
our destination was reached. This was through a country of very
varied scenery. Lofty mountains, still capped with snow ; swift
salmon rivers running through rocky and well-wooded straths;
bleak water-sodden moors ; lochs, some small and nestling on the
shoulders of the mountains, others more extensive and dotted
with birch-clad islets ; all these presented features unfamiliar to
the dweller in the South, and gave promise of affording a
Summer home to many interesting species of birds.
A good deal of our time was spent in trout-fishing on the
beautiful lochs of West Sutherland, and so it was with those
birds which haunt the lochs that we became most familiar.
We very soon found that we were not alone in our attempts to
beguile the wily little trout. We had a most conspicuous and
very successful fellow fisherman in the Black-throated Diver
(Colymbzis arcticus). A pair of these fine birds were to be seen
on most of the larger lochs of the neighbourhood, and very
handsome they looked in their smart Summer plumage, quite
different from the more sober-coloured dress they wear during
their stay in southern waters. We found two nests of this
species, each containing a pair of long-shaped, olive-brown eggs,
dotted with a few black spots. In both cases these had been
laid on tiny islets in the lochs, and were placed in shallow
depressions, scantily lined with moss and weeds, only a few feet
from the water's edge.
A good deal has been written about the position of the
Divers and their allies the Grebes, when on land, so we
determined to watch one of these birds leave the water and go to
her eggs, and so settle the question for ourselves. This, how-
ever, we found to be no easy matter, for the birds -were so shy
that they would not approach the nests while we were in sight.

Rav. F. L. Blathwayt,
One day, however, we had more success. Knowing of a pair
breeding on a small hill loch which only contained one islet, we
determined to creep up very quietly in the hopes of seeing one
of the birds on land. The excitement of that stalk was very
great. A long detour was first of all necessary ; and then we
crawled to the top of some rising ground, overlooking the loch,
and crouched behind a pile of rock, which much resembled a
Dartmoor ' tor.' Over this shelter we raised our heads inch by
inch, and soon saw the Divers on the water near their island
home. They evidently had no knowledge of our approach for
we had not waited a minute before one of them, probably the
female, swam towards the islet and settled down upon her eggs.
Two strong pairs of field-glasses were " glued " upon her as she
left the water, and so every movement could be clearly followed.
She scrambled awkwardly over the stones in the shallow water
and then crossed the five or six feet of turf between the margin
and her eggs by shuffling along on her breast, using her legs and
feet to propel her much as she would do in the water, and
never once standing upright. There was nothing graceful about
the performance, and it was pretty evident that the bird was not
at all at her ease on land. On reaching her nest she raised her
breast slightly and took a few seconds arranging her eggs com-
fortably beneath her before she settled down. We then showed
our heads over the rock and expected she would leave the eggs at
once. Her mate gave a hoarse croak of alarm, but the sitting
bird appeared afraid to move at first, and kept twisting her head
about in all directions as if uncertain what sort of danger
threatened her. When we advanced towards her she shuffled
awkwardly off her eggs, scrambled hurriedly along on her breast
towards the water and instantly dived, coming up again in the
loch at some distance from the islet. After watching this bird on
the land, it seemed to us that it would have been quite impossible
for her to sit up erect, in the way in which this class of birds
may so often be seen set up in cases or represented in pictures.
The other pair of eggs we saw were placed on a very small
islet in a much larger loch, and were laid so close to the water
that a slight rise would certainly have covered them. A few feet
away was a nest and eggs of the Greater Black-backed Gull

(.Larus marinas), and also two or three nests of the Common Gull
(Larus canus). We had misgivings as to the safety of the Divers'
eggs when we saw the Black-backed marauders standing only a
few feet off them, but apparently they had no hostile intention,
as the Divers' eggs were safe when we visited the islet a few days
later. It seems that there must be some sort of etiquette among
different species of birds breeding in close proximity. These
large Gulls are noted for their partiality for eggs, and yet these
three species were dwelling on this tiny islet, apparently in
perfect harmony.
It will be gathered from what has been written above that
the actions of the Black-throated Diver on land are anything but
graceful; but in the water quite the reverse is the case. The
bird is beautifully adapted for an aquatic life, and, except when
incubating or flying in the air, probably never leaves the water at
all. When alarmed, these birds sink their bodies and swim
rapidly along with the water rippling over their backs, and
scarcely any part of them but the head and neck showing above
the surface. They dive repeatedly, and stay a long time beneath
the water, often reappearing far away from the spot where they
vanished. The dive is not always a distinct forward plunge, as
is the case with the Diving Ducks, but, especially when alarmed,
the birds seem merely to bend the head and neck into the water
and so sink out of sight, scarcely leaving a ripple upon the
surface.
The Divers, though they have some difficulty in rising
from the water, fly well and very rapidly. We often saw a pair o.f
them circling high over the lochs while we were fishing. They
carry their necks stretched out in front and beat their wings
quickly, the mode of flight resembling that of the Ducks, but
they have a curious appearance in the air in consequence of the
wings being placed far back in their bodies. Just before the birds
descend to alight on the water, they set up a harsh quacking
noise, uttered very rapidly, but resembling somewhat the
quacking of a farmyard Duck. As the birds dash down very
swiftly into the water their note is somewhat drawn out, and may
be represented by the words " Ouarra-quark," " quarra-quark,"
the accent being on the last syllable.

Rev. F. L. Blathwayt,
These birds were a constant source of pleasure to us, and
often while fishing we would lay down our rods and watch their
habits through our glasses. The bird-life around us was in fact
so interesting that the weight of our creels, when we started for
home, was often far less than it might have been.
In the mornings, as we tramped over the water-sodden
moors towards the loch, for the day's fishing, the rippling wail of
the Curlew (Nttmenius arqucita), and the clear call of the Golden
Plover ( Chctradrius pluvialis ) could be heard on either hand.
Suddenly a Grouse ( Lctgopus scoticns) would blunder up,
covered with confusion, almost under our feet, and shout to us a
hurried but unavailing " Go-back " "Go-back," as he skimmed
over a shoulder of rising ground. Then a little black-breasted
Dunlin ( Tringa alpina) would spring from the side of some tiny
pool, with a harsh " cree," and dart away to the loch-side,
uttering while alighting on the margin, a long-drawn trill
sounding like a rusty electric bell.
As we crunched over the boulders and shingle to the little
stone jetty where the boat was moored, the startling double cry
of the Greenshank ( Totanus canescens ) or the mellower note of
the Redshank (71 calidris) would ring out over the water, as the
birds gave the note of alarm to all the dwellers on the loch.
The Gulls then (. Lancs canus ) would rise in a cloud from their
nests on the islands, and wheel in circles overhead amid a
medley of querulous and musical cries, the harsh croak of the
Greater Black-backed Gull, and the 'how-how-how ' of his
lesser relative ( L. fuscus) helping to swell the chorus.
As the gillie bails the rain-water out of the boat, we &amp;apos;watch
a pair of Common Sandpipers ( Totanus hypoleuais) flitting with
mournful, long-drawn cries, from stone to stone, anxious for the
safety of their young, which are doubtless crouching among the
pebbles at our feet. Suddenly the shrill 'wh&lt;?&lt;?you' of a Drake
Wigeon (Mareca penclope) sounds from above as the smart little
fellow comes to have a look at us, and warns his comrades that
we look dangerous. His sombre-coloured mate is doubtless
nesting on one of those lovely birch-clad islets, the buds of the
trees cow just showing pinkish-brown over the silver stems, but

here and there, where they have burst, veiling them with a
green smoke. O11 one of these islands we land for lunch after
the morning's fishing is over.
Above us, in a low birch tree, is a nest and eggs of the
Hooded Crow ( Corvus cornix), whose crafty owner thinks, no
doubt, that here she may escape the vigilance of the keeper.
The plaintive silver chime of the Willow Warbler (_. Phylloscopus
trochilus) and the melancholy chirping of the Reed Bunting
{Emberiza schceniclus) remind us of more southern regions;
presently, as we walk over the ground studded with pale
primroses and golden marsh-marigolds, up springs a Duck from
a russet patch of last year's bracken. No, she is not the Wigeon,
but a Common Wild Duck {Alias boscas ). That is our verdict as
we watch her with our field glasses while she hurries away, and
the eight greenish eggs she has left add weight to our decision.
But Wild Ducks' nests we have often found in the South, and we
want to see the Wigeon's nest, so the boat is taken across to the
next islet, and we proceed to search carefully all likely places.
Suddenly there is a flutter at the foot of a birch tree, and a small
dark-brown Duck bustles up and speeds away across the loch.
' That's the Wigeon, anyhow,' we exclaim in delight, and our
glasses soon shew us that we are not wrong. Rooking at the
eight eggs, we see they are quite different from those of the
Wild Duck we have just seen. There is no trace of green about
them, but they, are of a clear creamy-white, and make a beautiful
picture as they nestle snugly in a deep cup of dark smoky down,
with light centres and whitish tips.
But it would take too much space to write of all the
feathered inhabitants of these beautiful pieces of water. Among
the reeds and grassy tufts, or 011 the open pebbles near their
margins, the Redshanks, Curlews, Snipe, ( Gallinago ccelestis ) and
Lapwings ( Vaiiellus vulgaris&amp;apos;) were busy with their nests or
young. There, on a stone, sits a Cormorant (JPhalacrocorax
carbo ) satisfied with his meal of trout. Near the shore swims a
Red-breasted Merganser and his mate ( Mergus serraior), and
overhead, to the accompaniment of cackling cries, flies a ' skein '
of grey Rag-geese (. Anser cinereus), visitors from a distant loch

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
near the sea, where they nest on islands among the tall rank
heather. And then, just to add the finishing touch to the
scene, a magnificent Golden Eagle (Aqiiilci chrysaetus ) sweeps
overhead from his eyrie among the mountains, and looks
proudly down upon the loch as though to assert that he holds
sway over all.
And so our day on the loch is over. The 'zulu,' and
' grouse-and-claret ' flies have done their work, and some three
dozen spotted trout, averaging three to the pound, lie in our
basket. But though we have derived some pleasure, through
arousing some latent instinct, while pitting our skill against the
natural shyness of the little fish, yet we have secured a far more
lasting joy from watching, without harming*, the birds of that
beautiful loch in the far-away Highlands of Scotland.

I will not weary our readers with the many notes I made,
day by day, of the manner of the feeding by the parents, but
some must be given, as they may be of help to others in the
future. Here again we seem to see how birds do learn and profit
by experience. With the first young, the parents carried (or
appeared to) the mealworms to the nest--though I could not see
what happened at the nest--now they did not but fed from the
crop. Writing in September, just after popping a morsel of
egg-flake into the little tot's mouth, I realize how tiny that
mouth still is, how small the morsel must be that I offer, how
fingers are useless and how the morsel must be given at the point
of a pair of the finest tweezers; and then I consider how tiny
that mouth must have been when the bird first emerged from the
shell and how absolutely unsuitable as food is a lumbering meal-
worm. But mealworms, a limited supply of cockroaches, and

later some live wasp-grubs, were everything in the way of insect
life I was able to obtain. Only quite small cockroaches were
eaten, for Mesias seem to have but little idea of breaking up food ;
and, as is so often the case, they would not carry the tiny ones.
They had, moreover, the curious habit of nipping and killing
usually every cockroach and mealworm supplied, though not
otherwise touching them. After a while, both for themselves
and the young bird, they preferred the larger wasp-grubs, not
touching the small ones which looked too much like gentles ; and
artificial food they would not touch except occasionally some
biscuit water-sop. I notice, too, how inferior the young Mesia's
powers of swallowing are compared with, say, a young Shama's
of the same age. Wasp-grubs are too fattening as a sole food ;
a garden of earwigs, woodlice, ants, etc., would be of priceless
value when such a species as the Mesia has to be reared.
On August 18 there was a great disturbance in my next-
door neighbour's garden. The Virginia creeper from the house
beyond spread very thickly over his house, and he decided that it
must go. The large stems were sawn through where they
commenced to trespass, the whole mass fell into the garden, and
six men commenced to drag it bodily away. The thick foliage of
my own garden completely sheltered the Mesias--and yet they
deserted their offspring and disappeared. The disturbance was
soon over, and they re-appeared on a perch above my head, the
male kissing the female after his manner. Then he went to the
nest, fed the young one from the crop, and brooded it. In this
instance neither of the birds had been near the food dishes for
several minutes, and yet the male fed from the crop as a matter
of ordinary course. Their mode of doing this was instructive.
The parent would hold its head down for several seconds, with
the mandibles very slightly parted, repeating the operation
several times, regurgitation being sometimes but not always very
marked. I am positive that there was some secretion which ran
out of the crop, or came out from it, and which more or less
lubricated any insect that had been previously swallowed. On
one occasion, while the male was thus feeding, a tiny cockroach
" came up," as if by mistake, for he instantly checked himself,
re-swallowed the cockroach, and then again lowered his head.

On a later occasion, I found him doing all he could to induce the
young bird to swallow a mealworm carried in his bill, but he
signally failed ; I watched him for about half-a-minute, when he
swallowed the mealworm himself. After a pause, he regurgitated
and fed successfully. On another occasion the female took up a
small cockroach, maudibulated and swallowed it. She then
flew to a piece of bare ground, a wet mound, and pecked about,
the only food visible being a few stray Indian millet seeds. Then
she hopped about the boughs, slowly getting nearer to the nest,
as if to allow time for digestive work of some sort before she
finally fed the young bird, the regurgitating movements being
very apparent.
At first the male seemed to wish to monopolize the
youngster; and when the female came to feed she would peck
him without stint, though not spitefully, as if to teach him how
to act. After they had got into good working order, the following
was the mode of procedure. One parent, ready to feed, would
approach the nest with a whispered twitter; the sitting-bird
would come off; the new comer, perched at first on the edge of
the nest but, later, on one of the supporting twigs (was this
change just a matter of intuitive instinct, or the result of thought
set up by appreliensiveuess of weakness in the upholding bands?)
would feed the young one, and then would suddenly " flop " on
to the nest with a single movement. In due time the other bird
would return, and the same routine would be followed. I think
I may say that, although so assiduous in his attentions, the male
was rather more inclined to be rough and off-hand, the female
being tender and more gentle ; and she acted the part of nurse
with great care.
I have referred to the temporary desertion of the young
bird by the parents on an occasion when there was no cause for
fear. It was on that day that I first heard the alarm rattle,
which was sounded very briskly indeed by the male. Just a
week later, as I was dressing, I again heard him sounding an
alarm. I peeped out of the window, not a cat was to be seen,
and all looked quiet. But the old boy was rattling away with
might and main, the Blue Wren was uttering his little alarm-
cry, and many birds were clattering. I hurried down, rushed

into the aviary--and saw a sight which absolutely sickened me.
In the reserved aviary there still remain two upright posts, relics
of a long-disused gymnasium. Composedly and unconcernedly
there was sitting on the top of one of these posts a Burrowing
Owl. My old father Owl is an Owl of good parts, splendid after
mice; and there was not a bird in that aviary, including and
especially the Quails and Hemipodes, that he would not readily
strike and drag down into his Inferno - and he was down belozv
then. The aviculturist with insufficient accommodation lias
many difficulties to contend with which are unknown to his
brother in the country. I had thought that I had securefy
blocked up the Owls' subway into the far aviary, but by clever
engineering they had got the better of me. The actual bird on
the post was the son and heir to the lower regions hereabouts, a
very enterprising youth but too young and inexperienced to do
much harm, and really he seemed to be the only one that had got
through. As I darted for the net I glanced at the Mesias' nest,
and noticed that the mother was sitting as tight as glue. Poor
little man; hitherto (like other rackety boys, he had a way of
getting into difficulties) I had handled him so lovingly and
gently; and his amazement and consternation were great when I
whipped him up without ceremony, seized him anyhow, any-
where, my one thought being to bundle him out of the aviary as
quickly as possible. A little later the male Mesia came to the
nest to feed, but the mother would not move, and did not
uncover her darling until quite a considerable time afterwards.
On August 23, a fine afternoon, noticing both birds off
the nest, I peeped in, and there were one young bird and one
egg, the latter more or less 011 the top of the bird. On the 26th
I peeped again, and took the egg, which was on the top of the
young one and must have been a great nuisance ; and yet the
parents had not sufficient gumption to remove it. This egg was
practically a counterpart of the one already described, but it was
a little longer, the spots were more red, and there were a few
very sparsely scattered over the egg generally.
I could not fail to notice how squat the young bird lay at
the bottom of the nest, and how it did not rise on the approach of
the feeding parent. Not infrequently I observed the mother

Mr. Reginald Phieeipps,
examining it with manifest solicitude, and I felt something must
be wrong; and days passed by and it still remained in the nest.
But an enemy brought matters to a crisis --a little way that
enemies have of helping us by over-reaching themselves.
On the morning of the 30th, as I was taking my bath,
I observed three cats on the roof of the aviary. With a garden
syringe and so convenient a supply of water, on throwing up
the window, I speedily and with much valour repelled the
invaders. While dressing, I noticed that the young Owl already
referred to, who was on the perch close to the nest, was bobbing
and rolling his head about, evidently much interested in what
was going on thereat. When I came down, the parents at once
betrayed that the young bird had flitted, and I soon found it in a
damp hollow in the ground some three yards away. Rain was
threatening too, so I placed it in a nest of hay in a box, under a
shed--for the poor little creature was a cripple (rickets?) and
nearly helpless. After breakfast I found it about four yards
farther on, in a sheltered spot, so there I left it until the
afternoon. Then I arranged a larger open box with high sides,
hay covering the bottom ; and this was the youngster's home up
to the day of its death. The box was raised on a pedestal; and
during the day when fine it was placed in the open, at other
times under the shed. The fattening wasp-grubs were telling on
its health, so I endeavoured to shorten the supply, hand-feeding
it when I could spare the time with egg-flake, etc., dipped in
diluted fluid magnesia.
On the day that the young bird left the nest, and for a day
or two afterwards, the parents uttered several new little calls
and whispers as, with wasp-grub in bill, they endeavoured to
coax it to follow them up into the trees ; and from that day, and
for several days afterwards, I would hear a low plaintive call-
song of four notes, "Come Dearie do " ; but the poor little chap
was unable to raise itself sufficiently from the ground to enable
it to make a start with its wings.
Nest No. 5, commenced by the male on the evening of
the day that the young bird left its nest, is close to where No. 3
was, and is in a " hand " at the edge of the holty, well concealed,

especially above, but in the full light of the afternoon sun. The
birds have had enough of the Owls and gloom, of tossing
billows and nests of doubtful stability, and long for a little
brightness and warmth. It is not suspended, but fixed in the
"hand," and firmly lashed to each of the holly "fingers"
coming up around it. These latter come up so close to the nest
as to render unnecessary any such cables as held No. 2 (and.
doubtless No. 1) in position. From the remarkable manner in
which these birds so securely fix their nests, one feels inclined
to suppose that their ancestors must have been in the habit of
nesting in localities where storms and hurricanes were not
unusual. From the look of the female 011 September 7, she was
then about to lay.
And now I must bring this long account of the nesting ot
the Silver-eared Mesia in the rain of H.M. King Edward VII.
to a close--a very long but really only a skeleton account, for a
book might easily and not unprofitably be filled with the story of
this interesting species alone. The young Mesia died at 5 p.m.
on the 7th September, apparently from apoplexy, but it has not
lived its little life in vain, for it has taught us the plumage of the
species in its first feather; and surely its parents have set us an
example of patient perseverance under difficulties and dis-
advantages, and how to vary and adapt our work as circum-
stances may require day by day, and to do our work well, how-
ever adverse the circumstances under which we may have to
strive.
On the 7th, after the death of the young bird, a very low
mournful six-note wail came up occasionally from the Mesias'
aviary.
But joy came in the morning, at any rate to the Mesias,
for soon after dawn the light-hearted male was issuing his usual
invitation to that hopeless boy--and in the afternoon, for the fifth
time, the female commenced to sit, presumably upon one egg, to
be followed by a second in the morning.
Immediately after its death, I forwarded the body of the
young Mesia to Mr. Frank Finn, who most kindly furnished the
accompanying Report. I may briefly state that, during life, the

Mr. Reginald Philupps,
eyes were very dark, and the legs, feet, and claws varying
between light flesh-colour and light yellow; but all the
brightness of the latter passed away with their owner's life.
" One may most easily describe the very interesting Mesia
fledgling bred by Mr. Phillipps by saying that in its general
colouration it strikingly resembles a cock Blackcap, Sylvia
atricapilla , and shows very little of the characteristic beautiful
colouring of its own species. The general hue above is smoky
drab, with a well-marked black cap ; the ear-coverts are silver-
grey as in the adult Mesia, and the quills have light outside
borderings, dirty cream-colour on the early primaries, passing
into ochre - yellow on the secondaries. The smoky drab
colour extends on to the breast and flanks, but the throat and
centre of the abdomen are dull cream-colour, the throat
verging slightly on yellow. There is a slight wash of olive-
green on the back of the neck. Such little of the tail-feathering
as has grown is dull bl.ack like the inner webs of the quills.
The under tail-coverts are dull brick-red. The bill is dull flesh-
colour, horny at the tip and gape, and the legs, feet, and claws
dull flesh-coloured also. The iris has apparently been brown.
"This colouration is evidently not quite normal, as the
parents themselves when I saw them some time ago struck me
as having faded much in the same way as the Liothrix does ;
their beaks also were very pale, whereas the Mesia's beak should
be bright gamboge-yellow.* The bird in the Parrot-house
has still the bright hues of plumage and bill proper to the
species, so that warm housing would seem to tend to retention of
the colour in this bird.
" The black cap of this young bird is remarkable,
inasmuch as Mr. Oates {Fauna of British India , Birds, Vol. I.,
p. 244) says that ' the young have the crown yellowish at first,'
Relying 011 this, I stated in my article on the Mesia in the
Feathered World of January 7th, 1900, that the young had not
the black cap.
" This evidently is not an invariable rule ; and I have
noticed in India, where I had exceptional opportunities of

studying young birds, that the young plumage is in many
species decidedly variable, especially in respect to head-
colouring. Thus, in the Paradise Flycatcher, Terpsiphone
paradisi, the young is said at once to have a black cap ; and so it
has sometimes; but I have also seen it with the cap chestnut
like the back, and it varied in birds of the same brood. Again
in the Bank Mynah, Acridotheres ginginianus, the head of the
young is described as drab ; but I have also seen many specimens
in which the head was black as in the adults, although not so
deep and rich in tone. In the Blue-cheeked Barbet, Cyavops
asiatica, also, the young usually show the red and blue
colouration of the adult's head in a fainter form ; but this is
variable ; and I have seen specimens where these tints were
hardly apparent.
" It is thus evident that we must be prepared to recognize
a good deal of discrepancy in the colouration of young birds,
even in those bred in a wild state. I have seen it stated some-
where that the most vigorous young birds are those which tend
most strongly to an adult colouration ; but in the case of the
present youngster this cannot be said, as it was a weakly bird--
and no wonder considering the season.
"We must be careful not to attribute its dull general
colouration to inheritance of an acquired character--the fading
of the plumage of the parents. For obviously the same causes
which have dulled their colours have acted on the young bird
also from its very birth.
At the same time it gives us some idea of the extreme
rapidity with which a 'local race' maybe formed when mem-
bers of a species get into a different environment. Although
it must be again borne in mind that differences such as
characteiize local races may often be seen in individuals of the
same wild species living side by side ; and also most aviculturists
must have noticed that in captivity and under the same treat-
ment some individuals will assume abnormal colouration and
others retain their hues," Frank Finn.

conclusions ; and may not sex have something to do with the

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
differences in the colour of the caps? It may be unlikely, but it
is not impossible. It is not quite to the point, but one cannot
help thinking of the red-brown cap of the female Blackcap and
of her young, the difference between the sexes being shewn in
the cap at a somewhat early age. My young Mesia was almost
certainly a male, and the colour on the wings developed steadily
as the feathers grew until a day or so before death, when
deterioration set in. When it left the nest, the nuchal collar
was not visible, but later it was very apparent --R. P.]
Supplementary.
The foregoing having been crowded out of the October
Number, I may as well complete the story of nest No. 5.
As already stated, the female commenced to sit on the
afternoon of September 8. On the 10th there was a terrible gale
with torrents of rain ; the foliage which protected the nest was
blown to ribbons, and a part of the aviary above the sitting-bird
was wrecked. If the sitting-bird kept to her nest all the night,
as presumably she did, she had the full force of the gale and the
rain right in her teeth, without any protection whatever. I11 the
morning, she looked very much washed out; but the two birds
went on with their duties as if a gale with bucketsful of rain was
quite too ordinary a matter to be worth talking about; neverthe-
less the male seemed much concerned at the exposed state of
the nest. O11 the 14th, the sitting-bird came off for some wasp-
grubs, and I slipped round and found three eggs in the nest.
The male caught me, and came up with a loud and menacing
"quit, quit, quit."
There was very little singing during this nesting-time,
probably owing to the cold and moult. They freely came off
the nest, too, when I approached the aviary, and cried out
loudly if I did not give them wasp-grubs--but my stock became
exhausted.
On the 22ud and following days they were feeding a young
bird, but not once from the crop that I could see. Why this
-change? Perhaps the moult had something to do with it! Or

was it simply that, having got into the habit of feeding the last
young bird with wasp-grubs--which had to be carried and given
whole--they had learned a bad lesson, and continued to carry
and feed with the whole insect ? And this is not unlikely, for I
noticed that when I brought in a pan of mealworms, no matter
how many there might be, should there be a white one (new
skin) it was immediately picked out, doubtless from its similarity
in colour to the wasp-grub. Thus it would seem that we may
teach bad habits to our birds.
They would take a mealworm, hold it under one foot,
gradually shorten it working from the head, and then carry it to
the nest and present it as it was to the youngster.
Towards the end of the month, for several days, they were
greatly disturbed by a large noisy dog being introduced into the
next garden, and both birds frequently left the nest to cry at the
enemy.
On the 2nd October it dawned upon me that for two or
three days the male had given up sitting. I had been too busy
to watch, and am not sure when he deserted.
He was in full moult; and I wondered if he found it too
cold to sit on the nest, and so the female had taken up his work
iu addition to her own. I did not see the female leave the nest
once until the morning of the 3rd, when I found the nest
deserted.
There were two eggs in it, but I could not find any trace
of the young bird. I suppose it had died and been removed;
the male was too wise to sit on the two clear eggs, and eventually
the female (also in full moult) had likewise given them up as
hopeless. From early morn and all day, on the day that the
female ceased to sit, a mournful four-note song or call was often
uttered, and is still occasionally heard. Poor little creatures :
five nests--and not a single young bird reared to reward them
for all their toil and labour.--R. P.

The name of W. E. D. Scott is very well known to
ornithologists, not only in America, where he holds an important
official post in the Princeton University, but throughout the
ornithological world. Professor Scott occupies a somewhat
unique position amongst ornithologists, for besides being a
cabinet worker he is one of the greatest field-naturalists in
America, and an aviculturist. It goes without saying therefore
that a full account of his life and many and varied adventures
in the pursuit of ornithology is bound to be of considerable
interest; and we can only say that the book before us is one of
the most interesting that we have ever read. The author has
travelled to many little-frequented parts of North America, as
well as to Jamaica, often spending many months, or even years,
in his far-off collecting-grounds.
Although Professor Scott has been a collector all his life,
it can be truly said that the killing he has done has been done
in the cause of science. He recounts with horror the shocking
waste of life that has taken place to gratify tl insatiable greed
of fashion. When a } r outh he learnt to skin fnd stuff birds, as
every collector must do unless he can afford Jthe luxury of a paid
taxidermist to accompany his wanderings, and on one occasion,
being anxious to obtain emplo}'ment, he entered the shop of a
dealer in plumes, and asked for a job. The proprietor set him
to work to skin a number of small song-birds, which he did so
rapidty and well that he was engaged at #6 a week. Three
months were spent in this shop, during which he skinned from
one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty birds each day,
these being brought in by the local gunners each morning, and
consisting almost entirely of bright-coloured song-birds. These
skins were delivered to dealers on cards which held four each,
there being three cards in a box.

At the end of three months Mr. Scott decided to leave the
shop and seek to obtain employment elsewhere, and before very
long he was engaged to take charge of the natural history
collection of the newly-formed museum of natural history
connected with the School of Science at Princeton, from which
has long since grown the Princeton University.
Of the habits of birds observed during his many wander-
ings, Mr. Scott tells us much that our members will read with
intense interest. He viewed with the keenest delight the sight,
never to be forgotten, of vast colonies, or "rookeries" of Herons
and Egrets, breeding along the coast and lagoons of Florida, but
he discovered with dismay, six or seven years later, that the
whole of this "thing of beauty and priceless value, a never
ceasing panorama of action suggesting emotions of a profound
nature--all this was wantonly destroyed." The ladies who wear
the fashionable sprays termed "ospreys" and "aigrets" have
little idea as to how these are obtained. Let them listen to Mr.
Scott:
"The time when the several kinds of Herons, known as Egrets,
wear their decorated plumes is coincident with the nuptial season.
Then nature adds to their charm and beauty these superb decorations.
They are worn only for a brief period, perhaps six weeks or two
months altogether and during all this interval the birds are busied in
mating, in nest building, in incubating their eggs, and in rearing and
feeding their young. It is a comparatively easy thing to disturb birds
and to drive them-'av&amp;apos;ay at the period of nest building. Even when
the eggs are laid, the old birds will often abandon them if slightly
alarmed. When the helpless young are in the nest nothing short of a
catastrophe will induce their desertion. The parental instinct and
affection is now strongest; the perpetuation of kind, the great
. achievement of all life, is about to be accomplished. The consumma-
tion of that end, on which is based the strongest and most fundamental
of animal passions, is about to be fulfilled. This is the time and season
chosen by the plume hunter for his harvest. Now he realizes that the
cries of the young birds, hungry in their nests, will surely bring the
parents back at short intervals, no matter how frequently disturbed and
frightened away. To accomplish his object more surely he avails
himself of modern contrivances for killing. The almost noiseless
Flobert rifle, with its tinj&amp;apos; charge to speed the fatal ball, the gun whose
report is hardly louder than the snapping of a twig, is his weapon.

in a few moments, ami then the next pair are dealt with in the same
way. Continuous work of this kind from daylight to dark results in
two things, a vast pile of carcasses of the dead parents, stripped of their
beautiful plumes, and thousands of young birds left to starve to death
in misery in their nests.
"Such was the scene that I saw repeated over and over and over
and over again on my journey southward. Not only were the Heron
rookeries dealt with in this way, but on one large island I counted
scores upon scores of dead Brown Pelicans, stripped of their plumage,
and in the trees overhead were countless nests, which at the time of my
visit contained the bodies of young birds. Flocks of Buzzards slept,
gorged, on the naked limbs hard by, attesting to the horrible slaughter
by the countless dead they left untouched."
But enough of this sickening storjq we advise all our
readers to peruse the book if they want a treat, especially let
them read carefully the chapter entitled "A Naturalists'
Vision," for Mr. Scott is a most enthusiastic aviculturist, with
some four or five hundred birds which are kept under constant
observation.

some months, and quite equals the former volumes in excellence.
Mr. W. L. Sclater is alone responsible for it, although the late
Dr. Stark's note books were at his disposal. The present volume
treats of 183 species included in the orders Picarice, Psittaci,

Sir,--I n answer to Mr. Phillipps' query I regret to say that I am
bound to include dried egg in my condemnation of egg food.
Septicaemia, as occurring in its various forms in birds, is a very large
and interesting subject, and covers too much ground to be traversed within
the limits of one or two short papers. Unfortunately I cannot, for more
than one reason, well duplicate my articles in both the Avicultural Maga-
zine and Bird Notes , but those who are members of both Societies may
with Hamlet begin to realize by the time they have finished them, that
there is something more in heaven and earth than is yet dreamt of in their
philosophy.
At present, owing to the want on their part of "much more inform-
ation, they have no grounds open to them for criticising, since there is
indeed much that is outside the purview of those who have only
experience to guide them. For instance, the experience, not of one
only but of many centuries, seemed to teach that the proper treatment in
cases of phthisis consisted in stuffy, closed up rooms, and opiate cough
mixtuies. A little microscopic investigation has however been of consider-
ably mote practical value" than all that experience--in spite of the
opinion of one of my annotators to the contrary--inasmuch as not only has
it taught us to recognize the potential germs of the disease in air and food
and the effect of their development upon a receptive soil, but it has also
demonstrated the correct method of meeting them to their ultimate
discomfiture.
It is however not my intention to waste time on discussions with
those who are not equipped with anything beyond " experience," which, as
I have already pointed out in my original article, is common to all, and
which, as though to show its true value, only succeeds in leading us all to
different and often erroneous conclusions in these special matters of bird
treatmeut * W. Geo. Cresweee.
Sir,--H aving read Dr. W. G. Creswell's article under this heading,
I must acknowledge that I have not suffered the shock that he anticipates,'
-excepting that we are asked to accept as a fact that egg food is positively
dangerous as an article of diet for birds, without the slightest explanation
as to how this conclusion has been arrived at. That egg is a favourable
medium for the reception of various kinds of germ life has been known for
years, taking for granted that Dr. Creswell is correct in his statement
that egg food (not fresh and sweet I presume) does contain Bacilli which,
when received into the alimentary track of a bird, will sometimes produce

enteritis, this by no means proves that enteritis cannot be produced by any
other means or agents.
Cannot it be produced by copious draughts of cold water, wet or
frosted green food, bathing in cold weather and remaining wet too long so
that a chill is contracted? The first and second are frequent causes in
horses and cattle, and why not in delicate birds ?
Because the Bacillus of Typhoid has been found in oysters and this
disease has occurred after the consumption of same, is no one to eat
oysters? I think it is by no means an unreasonable surmise that many
oysters containing similar Bacilli have been consumed and yet have not
produced any bad symptoms. If egg food is as dangerous as Dr. Creswell
suggests, it is a wonder that the many hundreds of fanciers and aviculturists
have any birds left, as there are doubtless tons of eggs used annually. If
we are to eat nothing which contains germs I am afraid our diet list will
become very small.
The microscope is positively indispensable in pathological research,
and it is well to know that certain foods are more genial to the micro-
organisms which cause disease than others, but we must not lose sight of
the fact that there has been provided an immunity, excepting under
certain conditions, by which the higher organisms can repel the attacks ot
the lower forms. For instance the Bacillus of tetanus is frequently, if not
usually, present in the alimentary canal of the horse, but excepting under
certain conditions he suffers no inconvenience from its presence.
My experience, as well as that of others, is that seed eaters are more
subject to enteritis than insectivorous birds, and, inasmuch as the latter
would eat possibly a dozen times as much egg food as the former, it is
strange to find the Doctor stating that this (egg) and this alone is the offend-
ing diet which has done so much harm. Take, for instance, such birds as
Storks, etc., that live on garbage such as decomposing fish and such like, I
should think they must eat Bacilli by the million. If I can keep' a freshly
imported soft-billed bird for a month I consider him safe from enteric, and
do not remember losing oue after that time. I have used egg in one form
or other for years, and have no reason to complain of losses from enteritis,
and unless reliable data, drawn from facts, can be produced, I should not for
one moment think of abandoning its use. Many are the fanciers, grey and
bent with years, men not necessarily scientific, but experienced and
observant, who have succeeded in keeping some of the most delicate ot
soft bills in perfect health for years, aud the staple food has been egg.
Facts are stubborn things. What greater authority or more successful
exhibitor have we than Mr. H. J. Fulljames ? Who could bench a bird in
better condition ? His experience tells us that egg is good, and the
" Century Food," his recipe, is composed largely of this ingredient, aud I
have used it with the utmost success, aud can strongly recommend others,
to use it. I am quite willing to run the risk of the attacks of the Bacilli.

That seini-decomposing egg is injurious lam willing to admit, but what
other form of animal matter would not be equally injurious if decomposition
had commenced.
Many give their soft bills scraped meat. This should be quite fresh.
That mealworms given injudiciously are likely to cause serious effects in
some birds is beyond dispute, although Dr. Creswell evidently doubts it.
The cliitinous covering to mealworms is very indigestible to some birds, and
will produce swelled feet, fits, and even death in some cases. I do not want
to suggest that Dr. Creswell's theory that septic enteritis may be caused by
egg food is incorrect, but am of the same opinion. I also think that to
imagine that to refrain from the use of egg food will mean a perfect
immunity from the disease, is unreasonable and far from having been
proved.
Will Dr. Creswell give his opinion as to why enteric (septic enteritis)
is more common amongst hard billed than soft-billed birds as I have before
suggested ?
I have the pleasure of knowing a member of our Society who has a
Flame-shouldered Marsh-Troupial, fully 15 years old, in perfect health and
feather, that has been fed largely on egg food; for 14 out of the 15 years
the Bacilli have been endeavouring to destroy him. Unhappy disappointed
Bacilli !
And last but not least : Should aviculturists generally survive the
shock, it will no doubt have disastrous effects on those whose living
depends on the sale of this commodity, which is rather a serious matter.
Prove first beyond doubt, and I shall be with many others ready to
accept it as fact. Arthur Giuu, M.R.C.V.S.
Sir, --I have read the article " On the influence of diet on the Avian
Death Rate." My hobby was to find out the length of time that Waxbills
and the smallest finches could live in confinement, and in one of the cages
I kept between thirty and forty birds. Part of the diet given was
" Hofmeier's Preserved Yolk of Egg," and as my birds throve for nearly
nine years before the cat disposed of the lot, I certainly should not cease to
give this article of diet--but perhaps Dr. Creswell is writing of fresh
eggs, and I have had no experience with this as part of the diet of the
smallest foreign finches. W. T. Catueugh.

ill batching one youngster out of two eggs--it lived for three weeks only.
No further attempts at breeding were made in 1902.
I11 mid-April last, however, intending to carry the birds with me to
England, to my surprise aud pleasure one of the biscuit-tins contained four
eggs. Needless to say the pair of Conures responsible for these had no
sea-voyage.
While in England, I learned one egg again had hatched, and, after
slow growth at first, the youngster, I find 011 my return to Jamaica, has
made a perfect-conditioned bird not easily recognised from its parents.
A little more than three weeks back, the frequent visits of the birds
to their bedroom made me suspicious, aud investigation showed another
clutch of four eggs which were undergoing incubation; these were as
usual white, and a trifle smaller and more obtuse than those of the common
Barbary Dove. Of these eggs--despite the shaking caused by a hurricane--
two hatched on consecutive days, a third after three days interval, and the
last two days later. Thus, so far as appearances go, a further quartette of
health} 7 cage-bred Aztec Conures may be announced.
Soaked Canary seeds seem to be my birds' most useful diet when
breeding ; very little other food is looked at. The elder brother (presuming
it is a male), although well able to shift for himself, still shares the family
nursery.
To sum up :--my experience with the Aztec Conure teaches me that
it is decidedly interesting, neat, if not gaudy, not very noisy yet easily
taught to say a few words--a parrot near by being the instructor. Its
appetite is moderate--except when chewing wood comes in ; and altogether
it is deservedly a favourite.
Because of the birds' little failing for splinters, their cage is lined
with wire-netting; and, in explanation of its curious shape, I should add
that it is one of eigh t forming an octagon round a tree-trunk. In a similar
cage, opposite the Conures' ' back-door,' it may be stated that a pair of
Cockatiels are now incubating their three eggs.

ruin staring you in the face ; mice one can catch and bear with martyr-like
fortitude, but cats-
Then I bought a very fine pair of Nonpareil Buntings, expecting to
breed, but the fates willed otherwise. No sooner did the cock bird see a
rather smart little German hen, than he must commence to make fierce love
to her, ending in the pair having a nest with four eggs; meanwhile the hen
Bunting, deadly jealous, tried to woo the truant back, and pulled the
Canary's tail out for a Jezebel, the cock bird retaliating by scalping her,
and so died a valuable bird; the most aggravating part of the business
being that the Canary deserted the eggs a few days before they were due to
hatch out, the young in the shell being well formed.*
My greatly-admired Gouldian hen died on the nest just when my
hopes were rising to the highest degree possible, and after telling interested
friends I was likely to breed Gouldian Finches in an unlieated garden
aviary, but alas-! My hen White Java behaved in a similar manner.
The Egyptian Quails dashed and tore their heads at night trying to fty to
the moon, and died in consequence.
But enough of tragedies! The Zebra Finches are my only con-

even Dr. Butler throws cold water over one, telling me they multiply so

Sir, -- I believe this has very seldom been successfully accomplished,
so I think it may be interesting if I describe the successful rearing of two
fine young birds. They were hatched out on 23rd August, and are now--
17th September--fully fledged and flying strong. I have had the old birds
many years and they have always nested three or four times during the
summer, but the young ones--generally three in number--have always
disappeared on the third or fourth day after hatching, and I only once
found a body with the head bitten off. I have tried giving them an aviary
all to themselves, and also taking away the cock, but the result was always
thesame. This time the hen built a small slight nest in a dead yew tree
inside the wooden shelter, and laid three eggs; it was a quiet place except
for other birds who crowded the tree, and I feared would disturb her, but
she sat very tight, only seeming shy of being looked at. We made up our

minds that the want of a sufficient supply of insect food was the cause of
our failures, so we supplied them with mealworms, caterpillars, centipedes,
etc., about six ever}&amp;apos; hour, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. for the first week. The birds
came very close and asked for food, and a worm or insect was dropped one at a
time, and the cock and hen both took them, and fed the young immediately,
only taking a circuitous road to the nest to prevent our knowing anything
about it. Three were hatched out, but one was not so strong as the others
and died in a few days, and I removed the body. The young birds are very
tame, and one shows a little red on the wings, and the other has nearly
white wings.
Our other nesting successes this year are two broods of Californian
Quail, and one of African Quail; the latter laid seven eggs in a hole in the
ground, which I protected by placing a chair over it, as it was very wet and
rough weather. She hatched three, and one died when a few days old ; the
other two are now a month old, nearly as big as their parents and delight-
fully tame playful little things; we reared them chiefly on small earth
worms, and a little soft food, bread, etc. I opened the crop of the one that
died and found some white millet not cracked, and I thought that might
have caused its death, so withheld seed from the others till they were three
weeks old. I should say that I shut the mother and chicks up in a coop as
the cock seemed likely to illtreat them, and have only just let them out,
and the whole family runs about together and seems very happy.
I have also any number of Zebra Finches, and as many nestlings still
in two nests ; and my Australian Crested Doves have hatched two pairs, and
the hen is sitting again. Also Redrumps and Budgerigars have done pretty
well, but I should think on the whole it has not been a good nesting year.

Sir,--C an you advise me as to the feeding and treatment of an Indian
Oriole. I purchased him in the Spring from a dealer. He was then in full
plumage but tailless, and the dealer told me "he had removed the stumps
of the tail feathers to make them grow again quicker." The tail has never
come again, though there have been two or three small feathers, which
quickly dropped out. The bird has been a long time now in the moult,
and is nearly bare of feathers under his wings and breast. He is fat and
lively but there is not a sign of feathers coming. I feed on a well-known
insectivorous food, mealworms and bananas, which is the only fruit the
bird will touch. The cage is large and stands in a room with other birds
not heated. I fancy perhaps the bird needs more heat. He is very fond of
bathing. When I first got him he had red mite, but is now free from the
pests, as I washed him in quassia water, and now never see a sign of them.
He is tame and can be handled. M. M. Hamilton.

The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Hamilton:
Your bird, although apparently well, is not so. He is unable to grow
feathers owing to the want of those elements necessary for feather production.
I should certainly change your food. Try " Century Food " instead of that
you are using. I do not wish to detract from the value of the food you are
getting, as I know it to be very good, but I have frequently found a change
of diet work wonders in such cases. Give a few drops of Parrish's chemical
food in the water and keep the bird in a warm room. I shall be glad to
hear the results in a fortnight. Arthur GiUh.
THE RAIN QUAIL.
[The following account of the nesting of a pair of Rain Quails,
Coturnix coromandelica, belonging to Miss Appleton, and the rearing of a
chick which was hatched under a Bantam, has been forwarded to us by
Mr. Archibald SimpsonJ.
Miss Appleton obtained a pair of adult Rain Quails at the beginning
of March of the present year, which were turned into an outdoor aviary
containing a miscellaneous collection of Waxbills, Finches, Mannikins,
Budgerigars and Canaries. The aviary consists of a lean-to shed of the
loose-box type, with an outer flight of about 16ft. by 12ft.
Within a fortnight the lieu bird made a nest under a heap of dried
bracken in the inner portion of the aviary and in due course nine eggs were
deposited. These she deserted, as a result I am afraid of a natural desire
on the part of the owner to satisfy her curiosity as to how matters were
progressing. Within a day or two the bird laid again, this time in a hollow
in the sand about one foot away from the first nest, and again she deposited
nine eggs, which she promptly deserted on being disturbed. Within
another week she had formed another nest in the outside flight, under a
heap of willow shavings which had been thrown down to furnish nesting
material for the smaller birds, and her faith in the "power of nine" being
still unshaken, she again laid this number of eggs.
In the meantime Miss Appleton had procured a broody Bantam,
under which she placed the first two clutches in the hope that some of them
would hatch out; but at the end of three weeks there was no result. It
was then decided to transfer the third batch to the Bantam, and the result
was that two chicks were hatched on or about the 18th June, one of which
died on the 24th ; and the other is now a strong healthy bird almost the size
of the mother. Meanwhile this prolific bird had laid fourteen more eggs in
the last nest, which Miss Appleton kindly sent to the writer, who requi-
sitioned the services of a foster-mother without success.
I have only to add that, some few days before the last egg was laid,
the cock Quail managed to escape into the open country, and has not since
been seen. I strongly suspect he resented the manner in which his wife

Sir, --What would you consider the best food for Aurora Finches to
rear their young upon ? I have a hen sitting. She hatched a brood of four
or five, but, I am afraid, has not brought them up, though at times I think
the cock feeds them. I cannot get at the nest though it is in a cage. When
the hen sat on her first lot of eggs I had a supply of fresh ants' eggs from
Germany, which both birds ate very greedily, and since then I have always
put in small mealworms and a little "Century food," as well as small
cabbage caterpillars, which however were never plentiful, and the usual
seeds. J. Moerscheee.
The poliowing reply has been sent to Mr. Moerschell.
I should think your treatment of the Aurora-finches could hardly be
improved upon: and, as Dr. Russ, who successfully bred the species, has
not told us what food he prepared for the young; there is no means of
knowing whether he treated them differently from his other Ornamental
Finches when breeding.
One thing you do not mention which is generally useful--grass in
seed plucked in the fields and hedgerows. A. G. BuTEER.
PECTORAE RAILS.
Sir, --I have had in my aviary for from two to five months a variety of
birds, among others two Pectoral Rails, St. Helena Waxbills, White
Bellies, Grey Java Sparrows, all living together in apparent friendliness, but
about ten days ago we discovered the Pectoral Rails devouring the body of
a St. Helena Waxbill, which was still quite warm, and which they had
evidently killed. Since then they have killed and eaten a Java Sparrow and
a White-belly. I shall be glad to know if Pectoral Rails are generally
found to be dangerous to other birds, as it is curious that I should have had
them so long without their doing an}&amp;apos; damage. I have fed them on bread-
crumbs, a mixture of different sorts of grass, and sometimes barley meal,
and they have also eaten the millet and canary seed put for the other
birds.
Lately I have also given them mealworms, which they much delight
in. Would the mealworms give the Rails a taste for animal food?
Louisa Feieding.
The following reply was sent to the Lady Louisa Feilding:
I have never kept the Pectoral Rail, but have had several other
species which I have always found harmless among other smaller birds.

The Rails are, however, largely if not entirely insectivorous, and it is
probably lack of animal food which has developed this tendency to-
cannibalism.
Apart from a few mixed seeds, I give mine hard-boiled eggs, ants' eggs
in equal parts and a little scraped raw meat.
I would suggest giving yours scraped raw meat and hard-boiled eggs
and stopping the mealworms, which. I am afraid, acting as a stimulant, may
have been the inciting cause.
Cannibal propensities, however, once acquired, are difficult to-
eradicate, and should they still continue to prey on the smaller birds I fear
the only remedy will be to place them in an aviary by themselves.
J. Lewis Bonhote.
[We found this species dangerous with very small birds. It is very
fond of scraped raw meat, also cockroaches and other insects.--E d.]

It is important that a record should be kept of the arrival of rare
importations of foreign birds into this country, and the Editor will be very
pleased to receive communications from members who have received any-
thing of especial rarity. Several interesting birds have recently reached
this country, which have seldom been imported before ; among them we
may note several examples of the Red-collared Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus
rubritorques) and Brown's Parrakeet, from Australia, while the formerly
rare Bathilda ruficauda has been imported in immense numbers. South
American birds have been brought home somewhat freely, and one con-
signment contained the rare Orange-billed Tauager (Saltatorauraniurostris),
the small Brown-throated Cardinal ( Paroaria cervicalis) and the interesting
Oven-bird (Furnarius rufus).
From India, our member Mr. E. W. Harper has lately brought the
Gold-fronted Finch ( Metoponia pusilla), the Grey-winged Ouzel ( Merula
boulboul) and the Great India Weaver ( Ploceus megarynchus).

The Society's Medal has been awarded (September Number, pp. 366
and 377) to Mr. Leslie Seth-Smith, for having bred the Rain Quail, Cotnrnix
\0x25A0coromandelica.
An account of an egg of a Rain Quail belonging to Miss Appleton
having previously been hatched under, and the young Quail reared by, a
Bantam is now published. The Members of the Executive Committee are
unanimous in their opinion that the Society's Medal should not be awarded
for a bird bred under such conditions ; and it goes to Mr. Leslie Seth-Smith.
accordingly.
The Society's Medal has been awarded to Mr. St. Quintin, for having
bred and fully reared three young of the Ruff and Reeve, Pavoncellapugnax
(October Number, p. 400).
It is with extreme regret that the Executive find themselves barred
from awarding a Medal to the same gentleman for having bred two examples
of the Demoiselle Crane, Anthropoides virgo (October Number, pp. 390 and
40S). It has been pointed out that in a curious old work in the Zoological
Society's Library entitled Portraits of Rare and Curious Birds, zuith their
descriptions , from the Metiagery of Osterly Park in the County of Middlesex,
by " W. Hayes and family," and dated 1794, the Demoiselle Crane is figured
in colours, and it is stated in the text (page 4) that " The subject of this
plate, with several others, were hatched and reared in the Osterly Menagery."
Nevertheless Mr. St. Quintin has the credit for being the only person of the
present generation who has succeeded in breeding and fully rearing this
interesting species.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heathy
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
Bullfinch. (The Countess of Harewood). Haudreared. [It was much
emaciated and very anaemic. The strain of moult no doubt was too
great for it; this was followed by an inability to assimilate food, and,,
although it fed, it practically starved. Parrish's Food, in the early
stages, given in the drinking water, might have saved it].
Bulbul, Superb Tanagkr. (Mrs. Noble). [The Bulbul died of con-
gestion of the lungs. In all probability it was freshly imported and
contracted a chill. I am no advocate for keeping birds in a warni
humid atmosphere, such as one gets in a conservatory. The Tanager
died of acute inflammation of the bowels].
Lavender Finch. (The Hon. M. C. Hawke). [You give no particulars.
The cause of death was apoplexy. It w T as a cock].
Pintail Nonpareil. (Mr. B. Mason). [It died of broncho-pneumonia,
Parrish's Food was no good to him, but the glycerine might to a certain
extent relieve him. Some people ridicule medicaments in birds' drink-
ing water, but this is because they do not understand the management
and treatment of the lower animals. To give a bird medicine, fill the
drinking vessel to a certain mark ; note carefully the amount that the
bird takes on two or three consecutive days ; then add the medicine in
a proportion that will give the required dose in the average quantity
consumed, and, if the bird drinks more freely than usual, remove the
drinking vessel periodically, but if it does not drink so freely increase
the medicine in proportion. To catch up and administer medicine to a
nervous bird (for most birds fear being handled) is courting disaster].
ROSELLA ParrakeeT. (Miss Willatt). [Died as a result of a ruptured
blood vessel on the brain. This was not sufficient to kill immediately..
The inability to fly was consequent on the pressure caused by the clot
of blood on the brain. It was a cock].
Grey Parrot. (Rev. J. C. B. Fletcher). [Acute enteritis was cause of
death. Nothing could have been done to save it].
Bronze Mannikin. (Mrs. Robertson). [Death was caused by concussion
of brain, and was possibly caused by flying against some obstacle in an
attempt to escape liis persecutor].
Parson Finch, hen. (The Hon. Mrs. Carpenter). [Bird died of pneu-
monia. It was undoubtedly caused by chill].

Beack-headed Nun. (Mrs. Robertson). [Your bird died of dysentry.
All unnatural evacuations are deleterious and likely to produce disease
and even death in other birds which may partake of food tainted with
such. It is a difficult thing to explain the germ theory of disease in
language easily understood by those who have uot studied it, and, as I
always endeavour to make the result of my examinations as clear as
possible to the members of our Society, I am sure you will excuse me
going farther with detail, but I should certainly advise all such cases to
be at once isolated. This is a contagious disease, and I would certainly
disinfect cage, etc. that the bird has used].
\0x25A0Cock Cordon Br,EU. (Capt. Horsbrugli). [Apoplexy].
Madagascar Lovebird. (Miss Hamilton). [Bronchitis].
Budgerigar. (Mr. Archibald Simpson). [I have been consulted on
several occasions as regards Budgerigars dying in numbers in other
breeders' aviaries. If you will catch up all your young birds about ten
to twelve weeks old, you will find many inordinately fat whilst others
are emaciated. I find from experience this is a very critical period in
the Budgerigar's life : hence the low price of young birds. When I go
over mine, they are the yellow variety, I separate the thin from the fat
ones. The fat ones I feed chiefly on canary seed, whilst the thin ones
get canary, millet, and hemp, and by this means I lose very few. Your
bird died of apoplexy. Am glad to hear your birds had no soft food,
as this is quite unnecessary].
White Jackdaw. (Lady Lilford). [Pneumonia was cause of death, and
I am afraid the bird has been ill longer than you anticipate].
Cordon Beeu, cock. (Mrs. Noble). [It had a large blood clot on the
brain, from a ruptured blood vessel. Should you have any more birds
die, send them on to me, as I shall be only too pleased to assist you.
Many of the more delicate Waxbills die about this time of the year,
especially when the weather is bad].
Tudgerigar, cock. (Miss Tate). [Died of pneumonia; it was an im
mature cock bird].
Pekin Robin. (Mr. Moerschell). [Pneumonia].
I regret that two or three cases, including one from Mrs. Noble and
one from Mr. Rothera, had to be destroyed, owing to mv having met with
an accident which incompacitated me for several days, but I am now able
to attend to my duties. ARTHUR GILL.

Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
"Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. \V. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that 'No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The &amp;apos;Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
' Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos; The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth,
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought ahout
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by
G. E. Lodge enhance the value of the volume."--The Shrewsbury Chronicle.

The Feathered World -- 1 The book is beautifully got up and printed, and should
command a ready sale, not only on that score, but for the information
given by the author, who knows his subject."
The Ibis --" Mr. Setli-Smith sends us the first number of his new book on Parrots
in captivity, which will, no doubt, receive great support from our
friends the aviculturists. It is nicely printed and got up, and contains
four well-drawn coloured plates by Mr. Goodchild, besides some figures
in the text. Full particulars concerning the habits of the birds in
captivity are supplied."
Bird Notes--" A new work from Mr. Seth-Smith's pen is sure of a welcome
from all lovers of foreign birds, and we can assure our readers that
' Parrakeets ' will fulfil their highest expectations, and if they are
wise enough to become possessors of it, it will always occupy an
honoured corner in their bookcase.
" Most of the illustrations are by Mr. H. Goodchild, and are of a
high degree of excellence.
"'Parrakeets' will, undoubtedly, be the standard work on the
subject, for aviculturists."
Subscribers names will be received by the Publisher,

The latest achievement in Ornithology
from a letter from Mr. J. PARKINSON,
NATURALIST,
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October joffi, iqoi.
" Youi! Traveller was right in saying that the three nests of
Parrots which I have reared were brought up on your ^Esthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young&amp;apos; ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE" of Dec. 4th
Says-"Mr. Parkinson lias apparently solved the problem of
Parrot-rearing, which lias troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

THE WHITE-THROATED THICKHEAD.
Pachycephala gutturalis.
Through the kindness of our member Mr. Norman B.
Roberts, we are enabled to present to our readers an illustration
of this fine Australian species.
Dr. Sharpe enumerates no less than eighty-eight species
of the genus Pachycephala in his " Hand List," some fifteen
only of which occur on the mainland of Australia, the rest being
distributed over the surrounding islands.
Writing of this genus, Gould remarks:--"Their habits
differ from those of most other insectivorous birds, particularly
in their quiet mode of hopping about and traversing the
branches of the trees in search of insects and their larvse :
caterpillars constitute a great portion of their food; but
coleoptera and other insects are not rejected."
In forwarding us the accompanying picture, Mr. Roberts
writes: " I am sending you herewith a drawing of the White-
throated Thickhead, Pachycephala gzitturalis . It is not a rare
bird, but one, I believe, which has never yet been imported to
this country. There is however no reason why it should not be
as easily kept as many other birds of a similar nature.
" It has much to recommend it, being strikingly handsome,
lively, and the possessor of a very melodious voice.
" It is closely related to the Shrikes, and is a first cousin of
the so-called Yellow-breasted " Robin," which has been brought

over to this country from Australia during the last few years.
It inhabits the same country as this " Robin," and could be quite
as readily obtained. The specimens from which the drawing has
been made came from the banks of the River Murray, in New South
Wales. These birds are quite numerous in that locality, as also
are their near relatives the Rufous-breasted Thickheads (P.
rufiventris). In the latter species the cock has the yellow of the
underparts replaced by a beautiful chestnut, and the green of
the back, wings and tail, by slate grey, whilst the black and
white of the head and throat remain unchanged. The females
of the two species are almost alike."
The White-throated Thickhead is found throughout
Eastern and South Australia and in Tasmania. Gould writes:--
" It is rather abundantly dispersed over the forests of Eucalypti
and the belts of Acacia, among the flowering branches of which
latter trees the male displays himself to the greatest advantage,
and shows off his rich yellow breast as if desirous of outvieing
the beautiful blossoms with which he is surrounded.
" The stomach is very muscular, and the principal food
consists of insects of various genera, which are sought for and
captured both among the flowers and leaves as well as on the
ground.
" It is generally met with in pairs, and the males are more
shy than the females. It flies in short and sudden starts, and
seldom mounts far above the tops of the trees.
"The voice of the male is a single note, seven or eight
times repeated, and terminating with a sharp higher note much
resembling the smack of a whip."
Mr. A. J. Campbell, in his splendid work, tells us that
the nest is cup-shaped, and " composed chiefly of shreds of
bark and fine dark-coloured twigs, neatly lined inside with finer
twigs, rootlets, and sometimes portions of fine grass, and placed
usually a few feet from the ground in a thick bush in a gulley, or
in a scrub near a stream. Dimensions over all, about 5 inches
by 2 ij- inches in depth ; egg cavity, 2 % inches across by inches
deep."
The eggs, according to the same authority, are " oval in

shape, occasionally roundish oval; texture of shell fine, with a
glossy surface; colour, yellowisli-white, speckled particularly
about the upper quarter with spots of dark brown or amber,
intermingled with duller markings which appear as if beneath the
surface of the shell." ... A clutch consists of two or
three eggs.
Apparently this species occasionally breeds before the
males have attained their full plumage, as the following note,
also from Mr. Campbell's book, shows :--" One nest I noticed at
Dandenong Creek, near Bayswater, 22nd October, 1898, containing
a pretty set of three eggs, which were ' shepherded' by a pair of
birds both in grey plumage. This prompted my curiosity, not to
mention the sweet solicitous notes of the birds, so I left the
home untouched. On visiting the locality about a fortnight
afterwards, the same pair of birds were seen in charge, therefore
it is evident that the male birds of this Pachycephala occasionally
breed before they attain their beautifnl yellow breasts and pale
white throats."
In these days, when aviculturists think nothing of keeping
the most delicate species of insectivorous birds in captivity, there
is no reason why the handsome Thickheads should not be kept,
and let us hope that some enterprising importer will give us an
opportunity of studying them alive in our aviaries.

THE SMALLER RED-HEADED CARDINALS.
Paroaria capitata a 7 id P. cervicahs.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
When I imported an example of P. capitata in 1893 the
late Mr. Abrahams informed me that it was the Yellow-billed or
Brown-throated Cardinal, that it was an extremely rare bird and
worth about ^3 ; indeed he assured me that he should have no
difficulty in obtaining that price for so good a specimen.
In 1873, as Mr. Wiener informs us, the Zoological Gardens
purchased a pair of these Cardinals, which about that time were
imported now and then, " but have lately disappeared again

from the market." That statement was published many years
ago, how many I cannot sa5 ,r definitely, as the book is undated ;
but I should think about twenty-two years in all probability.
The very similar P. cervicalis to which, as I pointed out in
my " Foreign Finches in Captivity," the name Brown-throated
was better suited than to P. capitata , appears never to have been
recognised as being imported until the present year; when our
Member, Mr. James Housden, was fortunate enough to secure a
fairly large consignment, from which I obtained two pairs.
At the recent ' London and Provincial Ornithological
Society's ' Show at the Crystal Palace, Mr. Housden exhibited a
pair, and Mr. Storey (I think) a third example of this species, to
which, however, Mr. Swaysland awarded no prize ; as, he told
me, the species used to be imported as freely as the Common
Pope, and he considered the plumage of the exhibited specimens
very inferior to that of a Pope-Cardinal on the same bench.
As there is no record either in Dr. Russ' very complete
work--' Die fremdlandischen Stubenvogel,' or in any of the
published Zoological Society lists, of the importation at any
time of P. cervicalis ; and as it is impossible, if it were ever
imported as freely as P. larvaia, that it could have failed to
reach any of the European Zoological Gardens, and so find a
place in Dr. Russ' work ; one can only explain Mr. Swaysland's
statement by that very natural peculiarity of human memory
which tends to exaggerate facts with the passage of years, and by
the second fact that somewhere between the year 1873 and
perhaps 1878 a certain number of the very similar P. capitata was
being imported.
That these two supposed species were not recognised as
distinct by dealers, is evident from Mr. Abrahams' observation
that my bird was " the Yellow-billed or Brown-throated Car-
dinal," and that such a keen observer of the slightest colour
differences as Mr. Abrahams was, should not have distinguished
two related birds so large as these Cardinals, is I think sufficient
to make us carefully examine into the characters upon which
they have been separated.
It must be borne in mind that when the twelfth volume

on the Smaller Red-headed Cardinals. 65
o the British Museum Catalogue of Birds was published, there
were only two skins of P. capitata and two skins of P. cervicalis
in the collection. The specific differences in the key amount to
this, that P. capitata is said to have no black on the upper man-
dible and the legs yellow; whereas P. cervicalis is said to have
the upper mandible black and the legs blackish.
Now, in the first place the legs of P. capitata when
living, are flesh-pink, and the yellow which appears in the legs
after death is due to natural discoloration ; in the second place
the legs of P. cervicalis are also flesh-pink in life and only the
younger birds show any appreciable quantity of leaden grey on
the front, whilst the amount of this colouring varies considerably
in individuals.
In the second place the blacking of the upper mandible,
as shown in the plate of the Museum Catalogue, only extends
from the tip along the culmen and tomium. In one of my four
examples this blackening has disappeared from the beak with
the exception perhaps of a faint line along the culmen (which
doubtless will disappear later) whilst it varies in extent in all
four specimens.
When characters usually associated with youth are not
only seen to be extremely variable in individuals but to disappear
with advanced age; what is one to do? But there is another
point-- P. capitata has a black throat, whereas P. cervicalis has
the throat brown with reddish bases to the feathers : that looks
like a good character; only my most advanced bird, in addition
to its almost perfectly yellow bill and flesh-pink legs, has
acquired a black throat.
I am afraid, therefore, that the supposed adults of P.
cetvicalis are actually P. capitata in imperfectly matured
colouring, and that the young male of P. capitata in the Museum
is a variation in which the blackening of the beak and legs has
not been developed, or else has been lost before the head and
throat have acquired their adult colouring.
If it is possible, as Dr. Sharpe suggests, that P. cervicalis
may merge into P. gularis, although the illustration in the

Mrs. Johnstone,
Catalogue shows several marked differences ; surely one may
wonder where one shall look for satisfactory characters
whereby to separate the Brown- throated from the Yellow-billed
Cardinal.

Polyielis melanura.
By Mrs. Johnstone.
The Black-tailed or Rock Pebbler* Parrakeet is not very
commonly known, although I expect it is familiar to the greater
number of aviculturists by coloured plates, or perhaps by
personal experience in their aviaries. Mr. Campbell tells us it
.is a common species in South Australia, its native home, and
that it is generally to be met with in the interior provinces or the
vicinity of permanent water.
The cock is most lovely, and for those who are un-
acquainted with this species I add a short description :--
The head, breast, rump, upper and under wing coverts
are bright canary yellow, back greeny yellow, a bar of soft
bright rose colour across the centre of the wings ; flight and tail
feathers dark navy blue and black, beak deep rose colour. In
my bird the tail feathers are very long, the centre one measuring
ten inches, the whole bird nineteen inches. They are exceedingly
gentle, and I have never seen any of mine in the least disagreeable
to the others. They could, I am sure, be trusted with any bird,
however small and pugnacious. The hens are good layers and
sitters : both my hens, before I obtained a cock, laid five eggs
and sat the usual time. I did not take them as one hen at least
had paired with a Pennant Parrakeet. They would be very
useful, I am sure, to place eggs under when the rightful owners
declined to sit; they seem so anxious to nest, and I only regret
that I was not able to obtain more than one cock. Mr.
Campbell, in his Nests and Eggs of Australian Buds, says:--
* This species is a frequenter of rocks and pebbles bordering- rivers, commonly
breeding in the cliffs; and I am very glad to see that Mrs. Johnstone gives the correct,
instead of the corrupt and meaningless spelling of the familiar name generally used in
this country.--R. P.

on Breeding of the Rock Pebbler Parrakeet.
"Mr. W. White, Reedbeds (South Australia), whose roomy
aviary contains many beautiful Parrots, has a handsome Black-
tailed Parrakeet which has reared several clutches of young
Cockatoo Farrakeets. As soon as they were hatched by their
proper parents they were handed over (evidently by mutual
consent) to the Polytelis."
My pair commenced nesting early in April, and what I
noticed very particularly was the very quiet way they set about
it. There was none of the screaming and fighting which
Rosellas, Pennants, and Barnards invariably indulge in (unless
they are separately housed), but the hen quietly slipped into an
unoccupied tree-hole, the same tree by-the-by the Leadbeater
Cockatoos had previously reared their family in, and there she
remained, sitting very closely, and totally ignoring the frequent
efforts of the Pennants and Rosellas to displace her.
The eggs (five) are very similar to other Parrakeets' eggs,
round and pure white.
The young were hatched in the usual time, but remained
a good deal longer in the nest than the Barnards or Rosellas, a
week or ten days at least; and for some days before they flew
their little soft heads were constantly to be seen at their window,
until one, anxious to see more of the fascinations of the world,
fell or was pushed out, and lay frightened and helpless on the
grass. He was quite unable to fly or even perch, and crawled
away to some logs to find a safe hiding place. The remaining
two tumbled out--I cannot say flew--two days later, and for
some days were equally helpless.
And now comes the weak point in my pretty birds'
character; the hen, although a good nester and sitter, was not
an energetic mother; the cock totally ignored the entire family,
with the result that two out of the three young birds died.
In a small aviary this would probably not have happened ;
my aviaries are large ; it would take a certain amount of exertion
on the part of the parents to find and feed three youngsters who
were themselves incapable of running after the old birds ; added
to which the nights were cold and the days very wet; and so,
being unable to fly, they caught a chill and quickly succumbed.

68 0 ?i Breeding of the Rock Pebbler Parrakeet.
One of the youngsters that died was an undoubted
cock, the other a hen; the remaining one I try to think is a
cock; he is a dark yellow-green bird and has bright under
wing coverts, which seems hopeful.
I was glad when the young bird was seen at the seed
trough, as his plaintive demands for food were most distressing,
the old hen feeding only occasionally. The cock never at any
time took any interest in the young ones ; he sat as if stone deaf,
and took no notice of the hungry baby, who got as near him as
possible and begged for food. He generally shuffled off, and
evidently thought his family a great nuisance. I am glad to say
the survivor was strong-minded enough to take the matter into
his own hands, and is now quite capable of fighting his own
battles.
I must add that these birds are quite hardy, and will
winter well in a cold house. Mine have never been in a heated
aviary and are in beautiful condition, unlike the handsome King
Parrot which, unless kept warm in the winter, is very apt to go
into a decline.
[Note: --Mrs. Johnstone's birds commenced to sit about
May i, and the young were first heard on June 3. The first
young bird left the nest on July 12, and was followed by the
others two days later.
It has been indirectly notified to us (on September 9--
some two months later than required by the Medal Rules) that
a pair of Rock Pebblers belonging to the Rev. B. Hemsworth
nested on the ground (of their aviary ?), and laid two eggs, one
of which was hatched on May 4. The young one, a female, is
stated to have been fully reared and to be doing well, and is
perhaps the first that has been bred in the United Kingdom.
No account of the case, however, has come to hand,
neither has any communication been received from Mr.
Hemsworth; and the Honorary Secretary's letter of inquiry
remains unanswered. The Society, therefore, is debarred from
considering the case in connection with the Medal.]

PALACE.
The recent bird-show at the Crystal Palace, although by
no means remarkable for the number of exhibits in the foreign
classes, contained a few birds which were of very great interest,
some of these being the first of their kind to appear on the
show-bench. It is not easy to say positively which was the
rarest bird. Mr. Hawkins' Lagonosticta niveiguttata (a species
we hope soon to figure in this journal), and Dr. Hopkinson's
L. rufopicta are two rare and beautiful Firefinches, the former
being especially worthy of the attention of aviculturists. The
Great Indian Weaver (.Ploceus megarhynchus , Hume), shown by
Mr. Theobald, is probably the first of its species to appear at a
bird-show, although several specimens were on view at Earl's
Court during the summer of 1902. It appears that only some
twenty specimens of this large form have been recorded alive
or dead.
Amongst the Parrots, the most notable, so far as rarity
was concerned, was Mrs. Johnstone's specimen of Tanygnathus
everetti , catalogued as " Violet-backed Parrot." I believe this to
be absolutely the first and only specimen of this species that has
ever reached this country alive.
The Red-collared Lorikeets (Trichoglossus rubritorques&amp;apos;)
shown by Mr. Hamlyn belonged to the second consignment of
this fine species to reach this country. They were in very rough
plumage. Mr. E. W. Hawkins is to be congratulated on his
very perfect pair (the best we have seen) of Varied Lorikeets
{.Ptilo sclera). Their lovely condition speaks well for the
suitability of the food he gives them, which consists of honey
and fruit for the most part.
Dr. H. Lister's beautiful specimen of the Banksian
Cockatoo (Calyptorhyzichus banksi) was perhaps the most
striking bird in the show ; we do not remember to have seen one
of its kind at the Palace before.
Mr. Housden exhibited a pair of the Brown-throated

Cardinal ( Paroaria cervicalis&amp;apos;), and Messrs. Thwaites and Lloyd
sent a very nice specimen of the Crested Himalayan Bunting
(.Meloplms melanicterus&amp;apos;), a well-known species, but one that we
never remember to have seen on the show-bench before.
The class for Tanagers contained several gems. Mr.
Frostick sent an absolutely perfect specimen of the shrike-like
Magpie Tanager ( Cissopis leveriana ) and another which looked
like Tanaora palmarum, Mr. Housden the rare Yellow-billed
Tanager ( Saltator aurantiirostris) , and Mr. Townsend a Tricolor
( Calliste tricolor ) and a Yellow Tanager (C. /lava&amp;apos;). A very
perfect Blue Sugar-bird ( Dacnis caya?ia ) was shown by Mr. J. A.
Swan.
Mr. Russell Hutnphrys' magnificent Rufous-bellied Niltava
Flycatcher (figured in our last number) was quite perfect; and
it would be hard to imagine a more beautiful bird.
Amongst other birds, less noteworthy than the above, but
still of some rarity, may be mentioned Brown's Parrakeet
( Platycercus browni), the Tui Parrakeet ( Brotogerys tui ), Yellow-
Sparrow ( Passer luteus), Rufous-tailed Grassfinch ( Bathilda
rudcauda). Red-faced Finch ( Zonogastris melba), Wiener's
Waxbill (. Pytelia afro), Black-rumped Bicheno Finch ( Stictoptera
annulosa ), Parrot-finch (. Erythntra psittaced), Pintail-Nonpareil
(A. prasina), Desert Trumpeter Bullfinch (. Erythrospiza
githaginea ), Blue-winged Chloropsis ( Chloropsis hardwickii ),
Superb Tanager {Calliste fastiiosa ), Andaman Starling (Poliopsar
andamanensis), Red-headed Hangnest (Amblyrhamphus holoser-
iceus&amp;apos;). Aracari (Pteroglossus torquatus&amp;apos;), and Yellow-backed
Why dak (Coliopasser macrurus&amp;apos;).
It is not the intention of the present writer to criticise the
judging, except to remark that most of the rarest exhibits were
absolutely ignored, and in one or two cases the leading awards
were bestowed on quite common and comparatively worthless
birds. D. S.-S.

1903. The only birds seen on the journey down to Marseilles
were great numbers of Magpies in the fields about the railway.
Leaving Marseilles about one o'clock we steamed through
large flocks of what were, so far as I could judge, Common
Guillemots; after that my attention for the best part of the
twenty-six hours voyage was fully taken up with the rolling of
the ship, all the same I noticed a good many Lesser Black-
backed and Black-headed Gulls flying round. When about five
miles from Algiers, a small brown bird flew round the ship,
which may have been blown out to sea.
Next morning was beautifully sunny, so I went out to see
something of the birds which could be heard chirping from my
bedroom window. The Common House-sparrow was, of course,
in evidence but I thought he looked cleaner and brighter than
his British relative. Every now and then a pretty little
Warbler, probably of the Wood or Garden species, would fly
down to the long flower spikes of Montbretia, and peck off a few
of the insects inhabiting the flame-coloured flowers, which, by
the way, in this fertile land grows to a height of seven feet,
whereas at home it does not reach much over two. Some
old olive trees, well covered with ivy, were the home of a large
colony of Blackcaps ; such pretty little birds, rare with us in the
North of Ireland, they were here to be seen flying in and out and
fighting all day long. Behind the hotel was a rather badly-kept
vineyard which had great attractions for those butterfly-like birds
the Goldfinches, as Mr. Gurney, in his Rambles of a Naturalist,
very aptly styles them. They were alwa}&amp;apos;s to be found
feeding in large flocks on the seed-plants along with Green-
finches, larger and brighter in colouring than our species;

Linnets, Algerian Chaffinches, Serin-finches, Starlings, Black-
birds, Thrushes, Wrens, and Wagtails. At the maiket I noticed
Barbary Partridges, Quails, Woodcock, Snipe, Pheasants,
Woodpigeons, Green and Golden Plover, Teal, Larks, Thrushes,
and Blackbirds. In the Rue Constantine there is a fairly good

taxidermist's shop where I got three skins made from birds
I bought in the flesh. They were Barbary Partridges, Barn Owl,
and Kestrel. They cost about two francs each : very different
from the prices one would pay in England,, and the work was
neatly done too. In the shop I saw a Gallinule, Booted Eagle,
Hoopoe, Nightjar, Bee-eater, and Jay, also some Bitterns and
Cranes. I bought a Black-winged Kite, set up as if killing a
Bee-eater, for seven francs.
On the 3rd of March we reached Bougie, a pretty little
seaport with some splendid cliff scenery not far from the hotel.
Here we first saw Egyptian Vultures feeding on a large rubbish
heap close to the sea.
These particular birds did not strike me as being so
repulsive as one is generally made to believe Vultures are.
With the aid of my glass I had a splendid view, although I could
not get so near as some Arabs who were working in the rubbish
heap close to them : when I tried to approach they all rose, some
going to the trees, others circling round and flying off towards
the mountains. Round the splendid cliffs near Cap Carbon,
which are about 1000 feet high, I often saw a pair of the larger
Hawks circling; Ravens too were plentiful. One day, down
near the sea, I had the pleasure of watching for some time the
movements of a Rock Thrush as it ran over the rocks.
Mammals were scarce ; one day I saw a mongoose quietly
trotting across the road. Porcupines are said to be common in
the scrub; a skin of one hung in the salon of the hotel, said to
have been killed near Bougie. Their quills were used for taking
snails from their shells at lunch: a first rate tip for those who
like snails.
On the way to Biskra we passed through a great variety of
country; near the sea one notices rich red soil, then the railway
mounts up into small pine forests ; finally, after passing through
great grass plains, it enters the great Sahara desert close to
Biskra. Large numbers of Storks were seen close to the
line ; they have their nests on the trees, and when one gets
away from the tree country they build on the farm houses*
sometimes two on one roof. On one of the salt lakes we noticed

Mr. W. H. Workman,
a large flock of Black and White Ducks, but they were not close
enough for us to make out the species; small waders were
running about the shore, and farther on we passed a flock of
Cranes running away from the train.
Between El Ouerra and Biskra we passed large Hawks,
probably Buzzards, quartering the fields. At Biskra birds were
scarce ; I noted a Harrier, Swallows, Blackbirds, Sparrows, and
Redstarts in the Public Gardens ; at the Officers' Club were some
beautiful Dorcas Gazelles caught in the desert close by ; they
were quite tame and I got some good photos of them feeding.
Constantine, with its wonderful gorge i,oooft. deep running three-
quarters of the way round the town, was our next stopping
place; here up near the Jewish Cemetery I am nearly sure I saw
a Hoopoe, but have omitted it from my list. On the 16th we took
a walk through the gorge which is full of birds; numbers of
Lesser Kestrels were flying backwards and forwards, in and
out of their nesting holes in the great cliffs ; here and there one
would meet a group of Egyptian Vultures sitting about the places
where the town sewage flows into the river, waiting for some
delicate morsel that might chance to pass that way. This
brought the Vultures down much in my estimation, as the smells
in that gorge were quite beyond description. About the middle
of the gorge I noticed, along with the Jackdaws, a flock of dark
brown birds in size and appearance very like our Jackdaw, but
of quite a different colour. I thought at first they might be
young birds, but Dresser makes no remarks on any of the
Jackdaws having brown young ; I should be very pleased if some
reader could give me information on this subject. Dresser's
Manual of Palceardic Birds is a first rate book, and often decided
a species for me by its clever descriptions. I strongly recom-
mend it as a most useful and portable book. In the market I saw
Ringed Plover, Sandpipers, Quails, Larks, Blackbirds, Thrushes,
and skins of wild cats, badgers, mongoose, and jackals.
On the 17th we reached Hanmiam Meskoutine, to my
mind the most beautiful place visited by tourists in French North
Africa; here one sees the third hottest spring in the world
flowing over what appears to be a still waterfall composed of
glittering white lime deposited by the spring which in different

places conies bubbling out of the earth at a temperature of
203* Fah ; quite hot enough to boil eggs or vegetables.
Here, in the fields close to the hotel, were numbers of
Goldfinches, Dusky Bulbuls, Vultures, Buzzards, Barbary
Partridges, and other birds. While I was there a civet cat was
caught in a trap and put in a cage to be taken to Germany. the
poor thing looked very unhappy and would eat nothing. They
are very destructive to fowls. Another day a lynx and a jackal
were brought in by a hunter. When walking thiough the fields
I often came across the diggings of wild boars; the hotel
people had a tame wild pig which had been caught young close
to the house. Tortoises were common.
Our last stopping place in North Africa was Tunis, where
I noticed very few birds, it being much more of a town than the
other places we had visited. The Flamingo was conspicuous by its
absence, although some guide books will tell you otherwise. I
was told by some people there that to see them we would have to
travel about 100 miles inland. I visited the naturalist in the
Rue Al-Djazira, No. 19, and bought some skins.
At the Carthage Museum I saw a number of Ostrich eggs
dug up intact from the ruins of ancient Carthage ; some had a
network pattern on them, others were quite plain, with a large
hole in the end surrounded by six smaller ones.
As everyone knows, North Africa is in the Palsearctic
region, so that the common birds one sees every day are just like
our British species, aud in my list I have only a few that are not
known in the British Isles.
Of the books published on the birds I could only get a
few, they are as follows:--Gurney's Rambles of a Naturalist,
Dixon on Algerian Birds , Canon Tristram's Great Sahara , and
some articles in the Ibis, and German Journal of Ornithology.
Before I left home I enquired about bringing a gun, but was told
so many stories about the trouble I should have in getting it
through, that I decided not to take one, for which I was very
sorry afterwards, as I found the French had no objection to any
person bringing one fowling piece with their luggage, as long as
there are no cartridges; the licence costs about 30 francs in
Algeria.

PARRAKEETS*

<bodyText confidence="0.975621272727273" page_id="32958698"  page_num="Page 76" year="" vol="">
With the present number Mr. Seth-Smith concludes his
interesting work on the Parrakeets suitable for aviculture.
From the point of view of the ordinary aviculturist the
parts increase in interest with every successive issue. There
will be a very general regret that the work has come to an end.
But as Mr. Seth-Smith has already found that fresh information
and one new importation have rendered an appendix necessary,
may we not hope, that a few years even will render an enlarge-
ment, or, at any rate a continuation of the work, necessary ?
In this number we are at the opposite pole from the
earlier ones. There is much to be said against the Conures as
cage birds--not a little against the Eorikeets ; but who can say
anything against New Zealand Parrakeets, Turquoisines, and
Nymfihici ?
All we can wish is that Mr. Seth-Smith could have told us
more about them--about Nymphicus for instance. Why does
this bird live so short a time in captivity ? Why does it not do
as well as the Cockatiel ? Nor do I very well understand why
the Ground Parrakeet ( Pezoportis ) was never imported. I have
not only never seen it, but with the exception of the Zoological
Gardens, I have never even heard of any one having kept it.
If I may find a fault with the present part, it is that we
have not been given a coloured plate of this bird and of Geopsit
tac 7 is, which also I have never seen. But I do not think night
Parrots suitable for aviculture, and doubt if they would live long
caged.
Talking of plates, I have a criticism to make. Much as I
admire Mr. Goodchild's drawings, the plate of Cyanorhamphus
u?iicolor is misleading as to its size. Look at auriceps and it;
would not one say they are of the same size from the plate ?
Yet auriceps is smaller than novce-zealaiidicz, while unicolor is

very much larger. And from my recollection I should say
unicolor was not so yellow a green as here depicted.
Mr. Seth-Smith's work is valuable, not only because he
tells us what aviculturists have found birds require, but also
their habits in a wild state. The aviculturist wants to know both.
Sometimes the knowledge may help him in treating the bird
when ill.
While on the subject of health, one may be permitted to
regret that as the book was written with a view to birds in
confinement, Mr. Seth-Smith has not given us a chapter on
Diseases and their treatment. He may have felt that we know
too little for him to venture on ground necessarily so empirical,
but it is from everybody adding their mite of experience that we
may hope to arrive at any sure knowledge of how to keep our
birds in condition. I am always hoping that some day the
Pasteur of feather picking and French moult may arise. But
till then--till some man will devote himself to the scientific
investigation of the causes of these two plagues of the Parrot
keeper, everyone should bring his quota of experience to the
common stock.
Bast, but not least, there is a capital index. Works of
reference--and this will be a work of reference--are useless
without one, but this one seems to be unusually thorough,
thereby doubling the value of the work.
In conclusion, while cordially recommending Mr. Seth-
Smith's well got up book to any one who wishes to make a start
in the all too fascinating pursuit of aviculture, let us hope that
either Mr. Seth-Smith will himself embark on some of the
larger species of the family Psitlacus, or else inspire some one
else to follow in his footsteps and do it. The Short.tailed
Parrots--even the Amazons alone--would not prove less
interesting.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES TO BIRDS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996368945945946" page_id="32958700"  page_num="Page 78" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In Mr. Gill's report on Mr. Mason's Nonpareil in our November
number I note that lie makes some remarks on the above subject. I may
say en passant that the "some people" could not have been intended by
Mr. Gill to refer to myself, though I plead guilty to being somewhat in
accord with the views that he was evidently alluding to.
Mr. Gill says that "some people" do not understand the treatment
of the lower animals, and then goes on to give us his own plan of giving
medicine to a bird. For " two or three consecutive days " we are to carefully
note the amount of water the sick bird takes and then we are to add to the
average amount daity consumed (ascertained by the above method) the
proportion of medicine that will give the required dose. In order that the
bird's whims and fancies may not defeat us, we have then to watch
whether the bird drinks more freely or less freely than heretofore, and either
to take out the water glass from time to time, or else to add more medicine
as occasion may require. This is to a certain extent an improvement on
" giving a course of iron by dropping an old knife in the well," but it
seems to involve the necessity for constant supervision of the patient, which
I am afraid would hardly be possible in the case of most people who have
daily duties to perform.
But given that this question can be satisfactorily arranged, what I
want to know is whether, if the case is one that medicine can benefit, is it
wise to delay its administration for three days while we are deciding the
capacity of the bottle that is to hold it ? Such a measure of expectancy
would not commend itself to us in the case of a sick child, and taking into
accouut the difference between a child and a bird with regard to both size
and longevity, the delay of a day means several times more to the latter
than the former.
Mr. Gill goes on to say that " to catch up and administer medicine to
a nervous bird.is courting disaster." In this I perfectly agree with
him, and I should think everybody else does likewise. I certainly cannot
call to mind that I have ever seen or heard such a course recommended,
and should have thought it was needless to warn us against such a
practice.
I may add that I hope to shew later on that the very obvious
difficulties that exist in the way of administering remedies to sick birds are
of not much practical account.

THE INFLUENCE OF DIET ON THE AVIAN DEATH-RATE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991575" page_id="32958701"  page_num="Page 79" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I feel that for once I must break through the rule I have laid down
for myself of not discussing scientific matters with those who have not
studied them sufficiently to warrant their taking upon themselves the
role of critic. But since a letter appeared in our magazine last month over
Mr. Gill's signature, and ascribing to me a position which I have never
taken up, and which indeed I should be deterred from taking up by ordinary
regard for my own reputation, I am perforce compelled to say something in
answer.
No one among my lay readers who has intelligently read the " Story
of Bird-Death " as far as it has gone, or even my short article in this
magazine, can for a moment believe the statement or implication that I
have ever said that egg is the only cause of septicaemia as occurring in cage
birds. No one who is an expert in bacteriological pathology (which is
alone recognised to-day in those cases which are either known or suspected
to be due to the action of micro-organisms), and who has read even one page
of any of my articles ( wherever the)&amp;apos; have appeared) would for a moment
realize that I could say such a ridiculous thing. Apart from numerous other
indications in Mr. Gill's utterances from time to time, his very implication
that I have said such rubbish is a proof that he has never read with intelli-
gent appreciation either my articles or those of any other writer on micro-
organisms and their effects. Even supposing he had only had the opportu-
nity of seeing my very short paper in the Avicultural Magazine i or Sept,
which by its own internal evidence can be seen by any unbiassed reader to
be referring to ordinary cage birds only, it is difficult to account for his
having written what he has. And when we consider that being a member
of the Foreign Bird Club Mr. Gill has had the opportunity of reading
month by month the " Story of Bird-Death," his statement that "we are
asked to accept as a fact that egg-food is positively dangerous as an article
of diet for birds, without the slightest explanatio?i as to how this conclusion
has been arrived at " (the italics are mine), can only be palliated by the
assumption that his memory is so bad that he has already forgotten the
instalments that appeared in Bird Notes so short a time back as September
and October last.
Mr. Gill's letter simply bristles with evidences of his entire inability
to grasp the salient points of my argument; for instance I have never
anywhere said that enteritis cannot be produced by any other means than
through the agency of egg-food; neither have I at any time ever given any
person the right to assume that "to refrain from the use of egg-food will
mean a " perfect immunity " from the disease. I have been particularly
careful not to convey any such absurd impressions in my articles, and to
invent and then father upon me such opinions can only be regarded as
outside the bounds of legitimate argument or criticism.

Correspondence, Notes, etc.
I note that Mr. Gill asks me some questions. He will find them
answered in some articles I sent to the Editor of Bird Notes last August,
and which will appear in November, December, and January. (The Novem-
ber issue will have been published before this letter is in print). It is true
that these papers are very sketchy and incomplete, but they were only
designed to help my layman friends ; still they are at Mr. Gill's service, and
they may perhaps help him to understand what I have already written,
while at the same time giving him a little information on the subject of
comparative immunities. One of the questions however I may answer
now, although I should not have thought it necessary to explain to him
that when he talks of the enteritis produced by cold water, frosted food,
bathing, etc. he is talking in the language of long ago, when we supposed
such causes acted directly, whereas we now know that the effect of cold is
merely to lower the resistance of the individual against the attacks of a
micro-organism which would otherwise have left him unscathed.
There are man}&amp;apos; points in Mr. Gill's letter which very temptingly
invite attack, but for the present I will resist the temptation. There is
however on page 51 a minor error that perhaps he would like me to correct.
Septic enteritis is not the same thing as " enteric." This term is usually
employed to designate enteric fever, or as we used to term it--typhoid
fever, and septic enteritis is, as the French say, quite another pair of
sleeves.
In conclusion, I must say that up to now I have been much exercised
in my mind to understand why Mr. Gill should have undertaken the task
of attempting to criticise me. But I now wonder no longer, for I have just
referred to his report of necropsies in the October number of the Avicultnral
Magazine. I see there that without bacteriological investigation he is able
to definitely say in two cases of acute inflammation of the liver that the
disease was not infectious; also that a case of enteritis was not of the
contagious (sic) form. Seeing that neither of my pathologist friends, nor
myself, are able to perform this miracle I must, I suppose, recognize that I
have met my master.
W. Geo. Cresweee.
[We do not for one moment doubt that Dr. Creswell is perfectly
right when he tells us that yolk-of-egg is infected by septic bacilli more
readily than most substances, and we fully appreciate the value of his
discoveries, but we know very well that if captive birds, which are fed to a
large extent upon this substance, are kept properly clean, its ill effects will
not be apparent, and the birds will live for years in perfect health.
We are quite sure that very few aviculturists will discard egg-food
when they have proved, by years of experience, that it is the most useful
ingredient in insectivorous food mixtures. We are well aware that Dr.
Creswell regards mere experience as of next to no value, but we are

content to be numbered with those whom he is pleased to consider " are not
equipped with anything beyond 'experience.' " We have yet to learn that
Dr. Creswell has had much experience himself in keeping any but the
hardier birds, and, until he can show that he has been successful with
delicate insectivorous birds without the use of egg in any form, we are
content to continue to use that which every experienced civicultmist has
proved to be good.
We cannot see that anything can be gained by prolonging this
discussion, so it must now close.-- Ed.]

HOMING INSTINCT IN PENNANT'S PARRAKEET.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997833870967742" page_id="32958703"  page_num="Page 81" year="" vol="">
Sir, --The following experience with a Pennant which escaped may
interest some of those who keep Parrakeets, and proves that it is not
always hopeless to get them back if by chance they should get away.
A cock Pennant which I had only had two months was rather wild,
and, when anyone entered the flight, would fly backwards and forwards from
end to end so rapidly that some care was required in getting inside. This
pen contained a cock Barnard and some young Golden Pheasants, and I
sent my brother one morning to feed them as he had previously done so;
but, on entering, this Pennant made a dash towards the door, knocking off
his hat, and flew into some trees close by. The door of the pen is 6ft. by
2 ft-, an d m y brother 5ft. nin. So there was no great amount of space.
After reporting the matter we went to look for the bird, and I must
saj I felt vety little hope of getting him again. Bnt I had a recollection
of aremaik about some bird not being so likely to return as some of the
Broadtails in Dr. Greene s " Parrots in Captivity " (which book by the way I
sinceiely wish he would continue as the text is interesting and instructive
to read and the illustrations are the best I know of, my bird being the
image of the illustrations and colour quite as intense). Mr. Pennant was
not far off, and on whistling his call he kept answering; then we lost sight
of him for some time, and in the meanwhile had shut the other birds
inside their house, throwing open the aviary door with a long string
attached so that if he did return we could close the door from a distance,
keeping ourselves out of sight. I tried to locate him with a field glass, but
could neither see nor hear anything when, on looking round, lo and behold
he was on the aviary, but at the opposite end. trying to get to some Rosellas
and another pair of Pennants, and also the end of the string was that way.
So we made a wide flanking move to watch him from a distance, when, on
reaching the spot, what was our delight to find him inside his own com-
partment. A pull at the string, and he was once more secure.
I attribute the success in recapturing the bird to his not going right
away in the first place, and either answering his call or else his being able

to hear the other birds ; but evidently he knew his own pen. He has been
much quieter since his experience of liberty.

YELLOW BUDGERIGARS.
Sir,--A pair of Yellow Budgerigars came into my possession last
April. Later on in the year I came across a cocoa nut husk that had been
hidden away for years. This was hung in a small cage as an amusement
for them to nibble. As the opening to the husk was small, I noticed after a
time they had bitten away more than an inch, but it had been taken off as
straight as if it had been sawn. Then a few days after they took possession
and cleaned out a lot of the inside lining of the husk.
I kept a daily'- chronicle of their doings.
On the ioth September I heard a twittering, and a few days after
there was a shell at the bottom of the cage. Often both birds were in the
husk. All went on peaceably until the 28th September, when I found the
hen chasing the cock all over the cage. I thought it was to encourage the
young to make an attempt to fly. About 11 o'clock there were cries of
distress, and the hen had pinned the cock down in a corner. I had to
choke her off to make her loose her hold. The poor cock's mouth was
bleeding, part of the left cere pecked away, and the right shoulder
smothered in blood. He was put into another cage, and lay at the bottom
as if about to die. He was ill for some days, and I was afraid I should have
lost him, but he is now picking up again.
Their only young bird was a solitary female which flew out for the first
time on October the 9th. It was rather fainter in colour than its parents,
but almost as large as the mother.
I have never put Budgerigars up for breeding before, and I would not
have troubled you with this, but that I thought it must be an exceptional
case for a hen bird to suddenly assault the male and nearly kill him.

MARKING RINGS FOR PARRAKEETS, &amp;c.

Sir, --I think a word of warning as to the danger of ringing Cocka-
tiels with the ordinary metal ring (that is opened to clasp the leg and then
closed again) may be of use. I have met with three cases in which the
birds had accidentally pulled at the ring until they had caused one end
to overlap and in some way had got them so tight as to cause a serious
injury and much suffering. In one case the leg was cut to the bone, and it
was with very great difficulty I got the ring off. It was so embedded
in the flesh that I had to snip it off bit by bit with a strong pair of
nail scissors. In a second bird the tight pressure had turned the foot
quite dark coloured; and, in the third bird, the ring had in some way been
worked over the hind toe (which was almost cut in two) as well as the leg.
The birds must have done it themselves out of pure mischief, as, in
the case of my Doves, the rings stay on for years without in any way
injuring the birds or causing them discomfort. It is really necessary in
some way to mark young birds, and if any member can tell me of a safe
ring for Cockatiels, etc., I shall be very grateful.

DOVES EATING WORMS, &amp;c.

Sir, --In reference to Dr. Butler's query in the October No. of the
Magazine as to whether it is the hen alone of the Columbce which feeds on
insects and worms, I have found that both sexes enjoyed a little change in
this way from their seed diet.
My Bleeding-hearts eat both mealworms and small earthworms, and
the White-fronted or Violet Doves, and also a Necklace Dove enjoy a few
mealworms now and then. I have about twenty kinds of Doves, and I find
that ground biscuit (fancy lunch) and ground peanuts are very helpful for
keeping the birds in health. It is quite amusing to see how the Doves
are on the look out for their biscuit and nut each morning. I keep each
article in a separate vessel, and the nuts especially are much appreciated.
The fact that it is very seldom indeed that I lose an adult Dove proves, I
think, that the diet suits them ; and not only this but they never seem ill
and always look in good condition with their feathers " tight" and glossy.
I have not found my three Tambourine Doves very interesting so far.
They are beautiful little birds, two cocks and one hen. They spend nearly
all their time in the shelter, but come out sometimes into the flight
towards evening. They greatly enjoy sitting out in a heavy shower of rain.
These Doves have never nested with me, though I now and then hear the
cocks cooing, and once I saw one carrying a twig in its beak.
The ground nut is sold by Messrs. Armitage, Seed Merchants, Castle
Gate, Nottingham, in two sizes. The largest size (sifted) is the best for Doves.

HEN SHAMA ; THE GREAT RACKET-TAILED DRONGO.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99906587804878" page_id="32958706"  page_num="Page 84" year="" vol="">
Sir, --You will be glad to hear I have succeeded in getting the hen
SliSnia; it is only about two-thirds the size of the cock; are they always a
good deal smaller ?
Also I, rather rashly I am afraid, had a Drongo sent at the same time,
fascinated by the account of your "Puck" in Greene's Favourite Foreign
Birds; but now I am rather alarmed by being told that they are very
delicate and need exceptional care and warmth. I can quite understand it
at first, as it is a scarecrow, though even now a taking bird; but will it
really need greater warmth than, say, the Shama, when once it gets a little
more clothed ?
I should be much obliged if you could give me a few hints as to
feeding. I am giving it Dr. Butler's soft food mixture, with as many
insects as I can, and mealworms, also fruit, especially grapes, and a
little cooked meat; at present it does not seem to eat much except what is
given in the fingers, but then it only came last night. Would it be safe to
spray it a little to help it to get clean ? Its feathers are shocking, and it
seems to have no undergrowth.
Richard H. Widmot.
The following reply was forivarded to the Rev. R. H. Wilmot.
Speaking of the two birds in captivity, there is no basis on which one
can form a comparison between the Drongo and the Shama, excepting that
they both may make delightful pets. The latter is not " delicate," and if
neither over-exposed nor over-fed will live without giving trouble for a long
time. The Drongo, on the contrary, requires a good deal of careful
treatment if you wish it to live in good condition more than two or three
years.
A long time has passed since I wrote the story of Puck, who was
rather exceptionally nervous and timid. I have had three Drongos since
those days; and the species is no longer an 'uncommon visitor to this
country.
The Great Racket-tailed Drongo ( Dissemurus paradiseus not Chibia
hottentotta, the Hairy-crested Drongo, a very different bird), which pre-
sumably is the kind you possess, must be liept warm. In summer it will be
all the better for a little outdoor life, especially when it can fly; but it can-
not stand our cold springs and autumns, and needs shelter and watchful
attention in such a summer as we have now had; and when it falls into
moult in the autumn, not only must it be kept indoors but artificial heat is
usually desirable, often necessary. It requires much more warmth than
the Shama, if it is to last.
But the real difficulty with the Drongo, to speak plainly but not
prettily, is " Stomach." I11 this and in many respects it is remarkably like

that much abused and greatly misunderstood bird, the Cuckoo in captivity,
another charming pet if properly managed, which it rarely is. The Drongo
will not hop about and pick up tiny specks of food and grit, though when
it has full wings it will greatly help by catching flies and winged creatures.
If one could supply it with insects all the year round it would be different,
but one generally has to fall back upon meat. Let this be triturated as
much as you like, it is not altogether suitable, and sooner or later you are
faced with indigestion ; and to add to your difficulties it will then swallow
large stones, nails, anything it can get hold of in its endeavours to allay
the terrible craving within--and occasionally it kills itself. It is this
condition of body in the captive Cuckoo that causes it to greedily devour
nestling Canaries, etc., which has given rise amongst ignorant persons to
the supposition that the species is by nature carnivorous.
The Drongo is an insectivorous not a frugivorous bird. In the wild
state it feeds on insects, whose wings, etc., seem to act as " food dispersers."
Perhaps it rarely touches green-food or fruit, but it does (again like the
Cuckoo) in captivity. Not as food, but as medicine place a grape or two
within reach of your bird, and also a few dry half-withered non-poisonous
leaves.
A Drongo out-of-feather like yours should be kept in a long low box
cage, with no high perch. A low one should run along the front and
another a little higher along the back with a slanting stick joining
the two, so that it can readily sidle up and down. It cannot hop about
like the Shatna, and is often excitable and nervous, and requires
a good deal of patient management. If you can get the bird to descend
to the lower perch for its food and to take a sufficiency of it there (some
are much worse than others) place the dishes within easy reach, for it will
not readily go on to the ground, although a specimen in full feather
occasionally will. If you are not careful, it will fall into the ways of
the spoilt Cuckoo, and will expect you always to hand-feed it; therefore do
everything you can to make things easy for it to help itself. If necessary,
have a shelf fixed near the higher perch, upon which to arrange the food-
dishes. You must see that it does take food regularly, for it is too weak to
be played with; moreover, the more regularly it takes its food, a little at
a time, the better for the digestion. It may starve itself if not looked after.
Feed, according to the season, on cockroaches, earwigs, chafers,
woodlice, spiders, flies, beetles, grasshoppers, grubs, almost any living
creature you can lay your hands on. Naked nestling Canaries and
Sparrows would form a valuable change. Also baby mice (cut up if
necessary) would help. Mealworms are rather indigestible, but you must
give some if you cannot get anything better.
Your Drongo will probably not touch the soft-food mixture. Never-
theless always provide some, and on the top place egg-flake (large), a little

cooked meat most carefully scraped, a bit of plain biscuit crumbled, etc.
The latter may also be offered in the form of rather dry sop.
You should be very careful about spraying your Drongo in its present
condition, but little by little yon must get it clean. A very little spray in a
warm room may encourage it to preen what feathers it has--but a chill
might be fatal.
A little sulphate of iron, in flakes, placed occasionally in the drinking
water may be beneficial. If placed conveniently, the Drongo would
probably wash its face in the water-glass, but do not let it wet itself too
much yet.
vScatter a little common white millet seed at the bottom of the cage.
It may pick it up for grit instead of something injurious.
A female Sliama is smaller than the male, and the tail is not so long
and sometimes much shorter; but a good hen Shama is by no means so
very small. Both males and females vary in size, song, and other details,
partly according to age, but more so perhaps according to the part of India
from which they come. Reginald Phillipps.
THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
The fine new aviary near the Elephant-house is now practically com-
pleted, and should prove a source of interest to aviculturists next summer.
Whether the money expended upon this aviary has been wisely used seems
doubtful. Foreign birds which are less hardy than Gulls or Waders need
more shelter than is provided by the foliage of a few trees even dirring a
fairly warm summer in our climate, and should next summer be anything
like that of 1903, we fear the new aviary will prove to be a great failure.
If, instead of erecting this huge exposed aviary, built as it is on the north
bank of the Regent's Canal, the same money had been spent in the
erection of a range of smaller, properly sheltered, aviaries, with wire-
netting of small mesh, it would, in our opinion, have been far better.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. No
replies can be sent by post.
Californian Quail. (The Lady Dunleath). Has been in aviary several
years. [Ruptured blood vessel in the right lung caused death. Your
feeding was quite correct].
Pekin Robin, hen. (Mr. S. O'Reilly). Fed on soaked dog biscuit,
Abrahams' Food, mixed sometimes with bread, or potato, currants,
apple, and ants' eggs. [Your feeding is all right excepting for the
crushed dog biscuit, which I have yet to be convinced is good. I
would not use it as I should prefer fresh meat if I gave meat at
all. The dessicated meat is very indigestible. Congestion of lungs
caused death]. -
Madagascar Lovebird. (Miss Tate). Found dead. Has been out of
doors since April. Seemed perfectly healthy. [Your bird had a
fractured skull. I should be inclined to blame either the cock
Redrump or the Rosella. All my reports are sent in on the 16th of
mouth prior to publication of Magazine].
Chiloe Wigeon. (Mr. A. Cummings). Put into aviary 9.30, found dead
in pond at 2.30. [There was a severe injury on top of skull under which
there was a large blood clot, the pressure of which caused death. It
was a female].
Grey Waxbill. (Lady Carnegie). Apparently quite well yesterday.
Found dead this morning. Had been several months in aviary.
[Apoplexy was cause of death].
PlTTA. (Mr. Reginald Phillipps). Arrived very weak, wings drooping, and
in a state of irritability I have noticed only in dying birds. Careful
nursing only caused temporary improvement. [Acute inflammation of
liver and bowels was cause of death, nothing could have saved it. It
was a hen]. --
Long-tailed Grassfinch, lien. (Mr. T. N. Wilson). Had it some
months with five others of same species, Gouldians, etc. They have
been quarrelling amongst themselves lately. [Concussion of brain
caused death]. -
Snow Bunting and AvadavaT. (The Hon. M. C. Hawke). Found
dead. [I should say something had frightened them, as the cause of
death in each instance was concussion of brain caused by direct injury
to the skull].

Crimson Bishop. (Miss Woods). Found dead. Apparently healthy day
before. [Apoplexy was cause of death],
Pekin Robin, hen. (Mr. J. Watson). In perfect health yesterday, found
dead this morning. [Bird was excessively fat and apoplexy caused
death].
Budgerigar and Madagascar Lovebird. (Miss Tate). Both new
comers. [Both birds died of concussion of brain. The Budgerigar
was a young hen. Neither of these birds require artificial heat as
they are quite hardy].
Weaver. (Mr. Chas. L- Rothera). [Bird died of congestion of lungs.
Many thanks for kind remarks].
OranGE-Feanked Parrakeet. (Miss Showed). Found dead. [Apoplexy
was cause of death. These birds being usually so tame, take but very
little exercise, and being rather heavy feeders are prone to apoplexy if
given as much food as they like].
White Java .Sparrow. (Mrs. M. Sherston). Has been ailing some days.
Has had difficulty in getting up to the top perches. Had been sitting
for ten days. I took eggs away and put her in a cage in a warm room.
[Your bird died of a liver disease of long standing].
Cordon Beeu. (Mrs. Noble). Found dead. [The bird had a fractured
skull, caused by direct injury].
Red-headed Gouedian Finch. (Mrs. Johnstone). Appeared quite well
the day before it was found dead. The aviary is over-run with mice.
[The bird died of concussion of the brain caused by direct injury
to the skull. My advice, re mice, is do mot try to keep them out, but
wire off a small space where they come into the aviary and always
keep a break-back trap in the run ; you then destroy the vermin instead
of keeping them out of one place to do^possibly more harm in another].
Grey WaxbieE. (Mr. Yewdall, Leeds). Kept in outside aviary. Other
birds in aviary are Mannikins, Lovebirds, Cardinals. [Bird died of
concussion of the brain. I should suspect Cardinals or Lovebirds. I
think our winters are very trying to such delicate birds].
Beue-winged Lovebirds. (Miss Tate). In outdoor aviary. Found dead.
[Bird died of acute congestion of lungs. I have usually found this
species very delicate and should advise artificial heat. Am very glad to
assist you].
Virginian Nightingale. (Miss Shepherd). It was hatched in aviary
last May. Has never been noticed to ail anything. All right last
night, found dead this morning. [The bird was apparently healthy in
every respect, and I can only suggest death was due to nerve shock,
possibly caused by a fright].

THE
BIRDS OF TENNYSON,

Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late laureate&amp;apos;s works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literarv interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that 'No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which'the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of ! The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkin Watkins
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennvson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post,
"'The Birds of Tennyson' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

THE SUMMER OR CAROLINA DUCK.
sEx sponsa.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
It is a curious fact that in several cases genera comprising
beautiful and remarkable species contain only two of these ; and
examples may be found in the two Peafowls, the Amherst and
Golden Pheasants forming the genus Chrysolophtis, and the sub-
ject of the present article and its ally the Mandarin Duck (sEx
galericulatd). These two members of the genus AEx differ con-
spicuously from other Ducks, uot only by their short high bills,
crested heads, and long broad tails, but by the unusual shape of
the wing, which is unlike that of any other Duck. In the Ducks
generally the inner secondaries, commonly and conveniently
called tertiaries, reach nearly--sometimes quite--to the ends of
the primaries ; while in the Summer and Mandarin Ducks these
feathers are quite short, so that the primaries are largely exposed,
and the general form of the wing is like that of a Pigeon. The
colouring of these primaries, silver-grey on the outer web and
dark on the inner, with a steel-blue tip to this, is also unique
among the Anatida. They are small birds, only about the size
of the Wood Pigeon.
With regard to the distinction of the two species from each
other, there is of course no possibility of any difficulty with the
males; Japanese art, if not observation, has made everyone
familiar with the Mandarin's chestnut whiskers and wing-fans,
both of which are wanting in the Carolina, whose extreme rich-

Mr. Frank Finn,
ness of colouration, however, makes great amends, and is well
rendered in Mr. Goodchild's beautiful drawing.
The females of the two species are very much alike at first
sight, but there are two unfailing methods of distinguishing
them ; in that of our present subject the wing lining is pencilled
black-and-white, and the bill invades the face-feathering at the
sides in a point, while in the Mandarin Duck the wing-lining is
plain drab, and the face-feathering meets the base of the bill
almost in a straight line. Moreover, the Carolina is a heavier
bird and more level in its carriage and lower on its legs than the
Mandarin as a rule, although one of the latter species I had this
spring distinctly resembled the former species in this respect.
She also usually shows a strong gloss of green and purple on the
upper surface, which is lacking in the Mandarin Duck, and has a
wider white eye-ring. Both the white on the face and the gloss
on the plumage increase with age, and the former may so extend
as to meet above the bill.
The Carolina Drake in undress does not resemble his Duck
by any means as closely as the Mandarin, which, except for
retaining his orange feet and usually more or less of the pink on
his bill, is almost indistinguishable from her. He loses his
crest, it is true, but still retains his white throat-marking, and
shows a clear grey tint on the sides of the face, so that he is
always readily distinguishable. Young Drakes wear this undress
plumage as soon as they fledge, and so can be distinguished at
once. The fact is a remarkable one, and together with what I
have observed in other species, leads me to believe that the
"undress" plumage of modern Drakes represents what was
probably the full-dress of their less highly-evolved ancestors.
This plumage of the Carolina Drake appears to be very
little known ; Miss Hubbard mentions it in her valuable book on
Ornamental Waterfowl, but does not mention it as appertaining
to the young Drake, and I only observed it recently in three
young birds bred in the L,ondou Zoological Gardens. Neither
the old Drake in undress nor the young one in first plumage is
described in the volume of the British Museum Catalogue deal-
ing with the Ducks, and in the Bird Gallery at South Kensington

an undoubted Mandarin Drake in undress is, or was when this
was written, set up to represent that phase in the Carolina.
I ought, by the way, to explain why I use this latter name
for the Summer Duck. It is simply because "Summer Duck"
is only the book-name of the bird; to Waterfowl-keepers, both
in England and France, it is usually known as the Carolina
{Carotin in French), and under this name it constantly appears
at shows. In its native home of North America it is called the
Wood-duck, but this name has not gained currency over here.
It has a wide range in the United States, but is becoming
terribly rare owing to reckless shooting, and as it does not go far
north to breed, is in a fair way for extinction.. When unmolested,
it is willing to be familiar with man, and, being a tree-builder,
can be conciliated by means of nesting-boxes, the more so as it
haunts inland localities and narrow waters more than most
Ducks. Its natural breeding-places are in holes in trees, and it
displays a strong perching proclivity and great skill in threading
its way among trees and branches on the wing, the ease of its
flight, like the form of its wings, being comparable to a Pigeon's.
The young, which, owing to their sharp little claws, are
*excellent climbers, are allowed to fall from the nest, which they
do without harm, being so small and light.
The Carolina Duck has been known familiarly to European
aviculturists far longer than the Mandarin, having bred freely and
been well distributed early in the last century, when the latter
was still scarce and dear. Under these circumstances, Carolina
Ducks were often sold with Mandarin Drakes as their proper
mates, but in spite of this no hybrids were ever bred--a most
remarkable fact considering the close alliance of the two species.
Of late years, however, if I recollect aright, a hybrid was bred by
\0x25A0one of our members, which did not live to attain maturity. This
was a great pity, as, if a male, it would in all probability have
been a very beautiful bird, and of a beauty quite unique. I
should recommend anyone who is trying for the cross to use the
reverse mating, putting a Carolina Drake to a Mandarin Duck
a match which has probably seldom been tried. Some years ago,
it is true, there were on the Northern Pond of the Zoological

Mr. Frank Finn,
Gardens a pair of Mandarins and Carolina Drake, with which
latter the Mandarin Duck was mated, but they do not seem to
have bred. However, in difficult crosses there is nothing like
making frequent experiments, and now that Carolinas are dearer
than Mandarins, there is ample opportunity for such.
In disposition and habits the Carolina, as seen in captivity,
is much like its Chinese alty ; being active and hardy, much
attached to its mate, and well able to defend itself against even
larger species. The two species of ALx, although usually averse
to alliance, agree well together, and the Drakes admirabty set off
each other's beauty. The Carolina, however, is less active,
restless, and excitable than the Mandarin, and the Drake does not
"pose" in the laughably self-conscious manner of that species.
His note is also quite different, resembling, to my ear, the word
" An -nie" as called out with an exasperated inflection by an irate
matron to her errant offspring. He would seem also to be more
affectionate than the Mandarin Drake, for M. G. Rogeron, whose
book " Res Canards " is, for character-study, the best avicultural
work I have ever seen, has on more than one occasion known him
to die of grief for the loss of his mate. He also, according to
this gentleman, has the habit, unique, I believe, in the Duck
family, of calling the Duck to take any special delicacy he may
find in the shape of a worm or small fish; although it must be
admitted that, if she does not hasten, the temptation to swallow
the tit-bit will prove too much for her husband.
For breeding Carolinas in captivity the most suitable nest-
ing-place is a hollowed stump with a little duck-ladder leading
to the cavity ; but other forms of covered nests will also serve, the
stump being of course the most natural. If the Duck can have
liberty with her brood on a piece of water safe from rats, crows,,
and predaceous fish, and well supplied with natural food, she
may be left to manage her own family, artificial food being added
in the shape of meal and dried flies thrown on the water. But if
artificial rearing is desired, the Carolina's eggs should be set under
a steady light hen (such as the Silkie-Pekin cross), while the Duck
herself may be allowed to try her luck with Wild-Duck's or Call-
Duck's eggs. The young Ducklings which are being reared
artificially can be best managed, according to M. Rogeron, in

sunny pens under cover; for the first fortnight they are very
delicate, and should not be allowed to get wet; care should also
be taken to see that they feed well, egg-and-bread-crumbs, dried
ants' eggs, duckweed, and chopped calves' lights being provided.
When well started they are very hardy, and as adults do as well
as any Ducks. As two Ducks may be run with one Drake, and
as several sets will live together or with Mandarins, it will be
seen that a large number of these birds can be reared with proper
attention, so they will more than pay their way, especially as
the}^ are now about ten shillings apiece dearer than Mandarins.
The climbing propensities of the young need to be guarded
against, and even the adults when pinioned will climb several
feet of wire-netting if they mean to get out of their enclosure,
though they are on the whole much more ready to keep within
bounds than Mandarins.
It is, I think, a great pity to pinion these beautiful birds
at all, since the operation disfigures them more than other Ducks,
owing to the fact that so much of the primaries is normally
visible. If they have to be kept in an enclosure it is better to
stretch netting over this and leave them the use of their wings,
putting up a few dead boughs as perches; while on a large piece
of water every attempt should be made, by breeding from the
tamest birds, to establish a homing strain.
In conclusion, I would urge those aviculturists who are in
a position to breed these birds to do what they can to save this
lovely species from the fate which awaits it. The market is now
entirely supplied by captive-bred birds : indeed, one of our lead-
ing Waterfowl dealers told me some time back that, far from
getting any supplies from America, he would send birds there if
he could get them--none being then on sale. Now, I am glad
to say that the New Zealand Acclimatization Societies are bestir-
ring themselves afresh in the matter of birds, and I recommend
any who care for the preservation of beautiful species to do all
in their power to facilitate, by exchanges, the introduction of the
Carolina into New Zealand, where it would have, as a species, a
new lease of life. The Mandarin is already there, though only as
a captive ornamental bird as yet; but it can be readily obtained

from China. 4 &amp;apos; So that it is the Carolina which should have the
preference as a subject for acclimatization at present; and although
the export of most of the native New Zealand birds, some of
them very desirable, is now prohibited, I have no doubt that, if
exchanges could be established between the Acclimatization
Societies and aviculturists here, permission could be obtained
for the export of a limited number. In this way Carolina
breeders could do an inestimable service to aviculturists at large,
and I for one should be very happy to do anything I could to
help in establishing communication between New Zealand and
an} r of ourselves.

By Capt. Boyd Horsbrugh.
I enclose a few notes on birds I observed in the Western
Transvaal during two years spent in constantly moving from
place to place in the country lying between Mafeking, Zeerust
and Rustenburg in the northern part, and Kimberley, Klerksdorp
and Bloemhof in the southern. I was at the time absolutely
without any book on S. African birds, or my notes would have
been very much fuller.
The first bird I had was a j 7 oung Meyer's Parrot
(.Pceocephcilus meyeri) which was given to me by an old Dutch
vrouw : I carried ' George ' from pillar to post for a matter of 13
months; bj^dayhe shared a stout w&amp;apos;ooden box about 12 inches
square with a Ground Squirrel (Xerus capensis) belonging
to my servant, and they both slept as close together as possible,
and were the best of friends. The Parrot, when I first got him,
was only just out of the downy stage and had to be fed for some
time by hand. Later on he learnt to feed himself and saved me
much bother. O11 arriving in camp, the box was opened, and the
strangely-assorted couple had a good square feed of Ouaker-oat
porridge with lots of brown sugar, the more sugar there was the

better they liked it. After that they ran loose about the tent and
the waggon till dusk, occasionally taking a mouthful or two out
of a mealie- or maize-cob. When night came they were both
returned to the box. I left this bird with a lady in Mafeking,
and was very grieved some time afterwards to learn that he was
accidentally drowned in a bath, while the poor Squirrel died of
apoplexy--too much sugar I fear.
At various times I had nine of these Parrots, one of which
I still have and which is alive and well and slowly changing into
the adult plumage and getting the golden forehead of maturity;
I kept a keen look-out for any other sort of Parrot, but saw none.
These little birds are quite common in the Magaliesberg, north
of Pretoria, and most days, while there, I saw what were
evidently family parties of five or six individuals; they do not
seem to go in larger flocks, and are only found where there are
plenty of trees. The Boers often keep these small Parrots as
well as one of the Glossy Starlings, these being the only species
I saw in captivity. There should be no difficulty in getting some
of these Parrots imported, and I can assure members of the
Society that they are most desirable little birds with very
engaging manners and a great deal of character. The bird I
have now lived in Mafeking for some months loose about a
house, and slept on the foot of one of the servants' beds every
night.
Another little bird I noticed in Bosliof (O.F.S.) was the
Red-headed Finch (Amadina erythrocephala). Round the windows
of the Dutch Church in Boshof were some dozens of mud-nests,
built in the style of our familiar House-Martin by a little Black
and White Swift, which very much resembles the House-Martin.
Numbers of these nests were appropriated by the Finches, and I
often noticed them visit the yard where I was staying, to get
feathers for upholster}&amp;apos; purposes. I did not see them making
any nests for themselves, so I presume they found the eviction
plan, worked on the unfortunate Swifts, answered better and was
less bother. I saw no Red-headed Finches in the Transvaal,
although I kept a careful look-out for them.
In the Magaliesberg I saw numbers of the Grey Waxbill

and the Cordon Bleu,* aud nearly every time I went through the
thick bush country between Zeerust aud Rustenberg I noticed
some of the rare Violet-eared Waxbills. The two former generally
visit farm yards and gardens, but the Violet-eared I usuall}&amp;apos;
noticed in the bush itself. I have written to my brother, who is
in Pretoria, and hope he will some da}&amp;apos; - be able to send some
Violet-ears, etc., home to me.
Of the many Weavers, the Yellow-shouldered (Sitagra
capensis ) is ubiquitous ; every little pond where reeds or willows or
long grass grow has its colony, and in the breeding season the
males are very conspicuous in their bright black and yellow dress
as they chase each other slowly with their extraordinary flapping
flight, like that of a large weak-flying moth. The Red Caffre-
fink (Pyromelana oryx) inhabits the same sort of places and has
just the same manners and customs. I saw their purse-shaped
nests in hundreds along the Marko River, and they were
feeding in the oat-fields after the breeding-season in the fashion
of Sparrows at home. They also looked very much like
Sparrows at that time of the year.
All round Kimberley, and to the east of the railway line
between that town and Mafeking, there were great numbers of
the White-browed Weaver (Ploceipasser mahali).
This bird has quite different habits to the two preceding
species. It builds an untidy sparrow-like nest of grass, with very
little weaving in it. I have never found them except in acacia-
thorn trees, and generally at a good distance from -water. Dr.
Butler, I think, in his notes on South African birds, accuses it of
a sweet song ; it certainly has a song, lots of it, in fact it never
seems to stop, but every other note of sweetness is preceded by that
whizzy noise mixed up with an imitation of a heavy chain being
shaken violently, that all Weavers seem to delight in ; this song
it starts well before dawn, and as for quarrelling-. I once got
into camp after dark, aud after my supper wrapped a kaross round
me and laydown under some acacia- or wait-a-bit thorns, full of
nests of the White-browed Weaver. This was during the

breeding season. They kept me awake half the night talking to
each other or swearing at me, I don't know which ; and, as soon
as it got grey dawn, a pair, locked together and fighting like
bull-terriers, fell with a thump and a flutter near by, and went at
it hammer and tongs, making the feathers fairly fly. When nearly
exhausted they flew off, only to be imitated by various other pairs
of combatants. I doubt if I have ever met a more quarrelsome
little bird.
The Sociable Weaver Bird (Philcelerus sodas) I saw
breeding once, a nest about the size of half an average haystack,
riddled with holes, out of which the birds were swarming as we
passed. The tree was a big acacia-thorn and I had no time to
investigate it. I saw aifother nest the following year, on the top
of which the Boers had hidden very nearly two tons of maize
and pumpkins. When I reached it it had been set on fire by
some zealous yeomen, it being part of their duty to destroy any
food supply of the enemy. As this was not the breeding time no
great harm was done, but while I watched it burn a snake
came tumbling out of it, to be quickly followed by another, so
that birds'-nesting in Africa is not without its risks.
The Tong-tailed Whydali (Chera progne) is to be seen
everywhere, and the male bird with his peculiar floating flight
always reminded me of the males of the Red and the Yellow
Caffrefink, to which of course he is nearly related. There is
no reason why C. progne should not be freely imported; in the
Western Transvaal there must be thousands and thousands.
Some days, on an eight-hour march, there was never a minute
when there were not at least half a dozen in sight.
In some parts of the Magaliesberg another sort of Whydah
occurred, a sort of fawn-coloured bird with two very long pin-
wire-like tail feathers. He is not shown in Dr. Butler's " Foreign
Finches in Captivity," but I saw a nice specimen in the Western
Aviary in the Zoo a few weeks ago. In these same mountains I
often saw a bird which I now know to be the Pied Babbling
Thrush (Crateropus bicolor) ; it had the same sort of habits as the
"Seven Sisters" of India; about a dozen get into a bush and
make a fearful racket, and, at the last minute, when you are a few

feet off, tumble out of it and go off, looking as if they had only
just learnt how to fly.
A bird that seemed to be quite as attractive as the well-
known Shamah of India was the Cape Robin ( Cossypha cajfra).
It was very familiar in the Colony, and I found a nest on a
drawing-room mantelpiece of a deserted house. The hen bird sat
on her eggs until I almost touched her. This species struck me
as being a near relation of the Shamah and the male is very
handsome.
I saw in the bush-veldt plenty of the large Black and
White South African Long-tailed Shrike ( Urolestes mela?ioleucus );
they always went in parties of six to eight, and sat on some
vantage ground like the top of a high tree, and answered each
other with a loud and penetrating note.
The lovely Natal Bush-Shrike (Laniarius auadricolor ) I
only saw once : it looked like a spot of flame in the tree and was
busily engaged in mobbing a Pearl-spotted Owl ( Glaucidium
per latum).
The Backbakiri {Laniarius gutturalis ), a very handsome
pale green bird with a yellow bib edged with black in the male,
was exceedingly common everywhere that there was a bit of
plantation, and their loud ringing call of five notes, two of which
are uttered by the male and three by the female, but so run into
one another that you could almost swear it is one bird, can be
heard at Cape Town and every station almost to Mafeking.
If a fire started in the grass among the bushes the
African Drongo usually turned up in force to have a good feed
off the unfortunate insects that were obliged to move ; they were
very often accompanied by the South African Roller.
Although the Wattled Starling (Dilophus carunailatus) was
said to be very numerous, I never met with it, but I believe it
only turns up in certain years. The Common Spreo (, Spreo
bicolor) which looks just like a Common Starling with white vest
and under-tail coverts is enormously common. It nests in holes
in banks and such like places and roosts out of the breeding
season, like our Starling, in reed-beds. The Cape Glossy
Starling (A my dr us morio) I found nesting in holes in a rocky

cavern on the Malmain River ; I had to swim through another
small cave first, which was tenanted by scores of loathsome
bats, which smelt abominably and flew into my hair in their
fright, and then came to a large cavern in which I got a nest of
this bird as well as a couple of just fledged Speckled Pigeons
(Columba phceonota).
These Pigeons are very easy to tame. At a German
missionary's I saw a small flock that had complete liberty and
were nesting in boxes under the verandah roof just like tame
Pigeons. The missionary told me he had pies of the young
squabs at frequent intervals.
A very nice little bird, quite common near Mafelcing,
and also near Kimberley, was one of the Finch-Larks; the
species I was not quite certain of and cartridges were too
expensive to waste on birds of its size, but dozens could
quite easily be caught. The Cape Long-Claw (Macronyx
capejisis~), like a Lark with a } r ellow bib and a cry like a young
kitten, was common everywhere in the Colony.
The Cape Dove (CEna capejisis ) and the Cape Turtle-Dove
(Turtur capicola ) are to be found in every cattle-kraal in the
country. In Cape Colony I have seen the latter in dozens.
One species of Hemipode, with a breast spotted like a
Thrush, is not uncommon between Zeerust and Mafeking;
probably it is Turnix hottentotta. I have often seen it flushed by
a screen of scouts several times ; each time it flew a shorter
distance and finally squatted ; and once I put my hat over a
squatting bird and examined it before turning it loose. The
first bird I saw looked like a sport or variety of the Common
Quail which I was out shooting at the time. They look quite a
light cream colour when flying, and I was very disappointed
when I shot it and recognised it.
The only other birds I got of interest were three j^oung
Pearl-Spotted Owlets ( Glaucidiumperlatum ). A native found them
in the downy stage in a hole of a tree, and gave them to me. I
fed them on locusts, grasshoppers and bits of birds, and finally
gave them to the Pretoria Zoological Gardens, where I believe
they all died from a surfeit of raw meat.

DOVE.
By A. G. Butler, Pli.D.
In a paper published in the Magazine for October, 1903,
pp. 397--399, I recorded some unsuccessful efforts to breed
Tympanistria, both in and out of doors ; the only result
attained being the construction of nests and production of
infertile eggs in the bird-room. I now have to note a slight
advance in the programme, resulting in the hatching and partial
rearing of one nestling.
At the end of September I thought it wise to catch my
Doves and restore them to their indoor aviaries, a task which,
with some little personal mishaps, I safely accomplished.
Within a week the Tambourine Doves were quite
reconciled to the change from their freer life, and began to
examine their old nest-basket; shortly afterwards the cock bird
resumed its song, which I had never once heard whilst it was in
the open,* and by about the 23rd of October the first egg was
laid, and the birds began to take turns upon the nest as in the
summer. O11 the 10th of November I found the chipped half of
an egg-shell upon the floor, and knew that a youngster must
have been hatched. For three days the hen only left the nest
for a hurried meal once or twice in the day, the cock being
almost equally attentive, but sitting ]:&amp;gt;artly on the edge of the
nest-basket, partly over the hen.
Whether the combined attentions of both parents were too
overpowering for the young Dove, or whether they were more
anxious to keep it warm than to feed it regularly I cannot say ;
but, on the morning of the 19th both parents had left the nest,
and showed no inclination to return to it; therefore I examined
the nest, in which I found one partly feathered youngster and an
addled egg.
* Hoo, hoc, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, ug-gitg-gug-uggle, ugglu, uggle, is a vague
representation of it; the hoo is repeated more and more rapidly until it becomes a mere
guttural rattle.--A. G. B.

on more Attempts to Breed the Tambourine Dove. ioi
As I do not consider it probable that the young of the
Tambourine Dove at the age of nine days has hitherto been
described, I think it may be interesting to describe it:--The
skin, where not feathered, is of an ash-grey colour, the crown of
the head sparsely covered with straggling sandy-coloured hairs,
the neck and sides of breast below clothed with half-developed
whity-brown downy feathers, those of the breast with broad
ill-defined subterminal blackish transverse bands ; the flanking
feathers of the abdomen are also downy, but pure white ; all the
feathers of the wings and tail are of a bright coffee-brown
colour with broad subterminal irregular transverse black bands ;
the bill is black with bone-yellowish tip ; the feet dark horn
brown, becoming almost black on the toes; the claws reddish
horn-colour. I was too late to note the colour of the iris.
In the description of the immature young in the Museum
Catalogue the only approach to the above colouring is in the
secondaries, which are said to have rufous bauds towards the
tips; I think therefore that this very early plumage, which,
though less sandy in aspect, vaguely reminds one of Pallas'
Sand-Grouse, may have some significance as an indication of the
ancestral colouring of the Doves: Mr. Seth-Smith tells me
that the same general appearance occurs in the very young
nestlings of other species; and, even in a much more developed
nestling of Phlogcenas sent to me by Miss Alderson, there is an
indication of subterminal dusky transverse bars on the brown-
tipped steel-bluish feathers of the upper parts.
I believe my Doves are contemplating another attempt
now, which will, it is to be hoped, be more satisfactory ; but in
any case each phase of the plumage of this or an)^ other bird
when described, is one further detail added to the life-history of
the species, and therefore not time wasted.*
* The doves sat steadily for about six days, and then I found a broken egg on the
floor: on examining the nest I discovered nothing therein.--A. G. B.

FOREIGN BIRDS AT THE DECEMBER BIRD-SHOW
AT THE CRYSTAL PALACE.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997034787878788" page_id="32958738"  page_num="Page 102" year="" vol="">
The recent Bird-show, held on the Sth, 9th, and 10th of
December, is a new institution as far as the Crystal Palace is
concerned, and it certainly gives promise of eclipsing the
older established shows, held in the Autumn and early Spring.
The December Show was held by the London Cage Bird
Association, the National British Bird and Mule Club, and
the Foreign Bird Club, and to the latter body belongs the credit
of having made the Foreign Bird Section what it was--the
best collection that has been brought together at the Crystal
Palace for the last three or four years; and I may here remark
that the compliment paid by the Council of the F. B. C. in
sending free passes to the Members of the Council of the
Avicultural Society was much appreciated.
The Judging of the Foreign Section was done by very
experienced aviculturists, and the general opinion seems to be
that it could hardly have been carried out better than it was.
Space only permits of our mentioning the most notable exhibits
in the Foreign Classes.
Amongst the Parrakeets, Mr. Hawkins' fine pair of
Varied Lorikeets obtained first prize, the second going to a good
pair of Kings. Mr. Hamlyn sent a good specimen of the rare
Red-collared Lorikeet {Trichoglossus rubritorques), Mr. Hawkins'
a Tui (. Brotogeiys tui ), Messrs. Thwaites and Lloyd a Rock
Pepler or Black-tailed Parrakeet ( Polytelis melanura), and Mr.
Osbaldeston a Malabar Parrakeet (. Palceornis peristerodes), a species
seldom seen. There were several other good birds in this Class.
Dr. Lister sent his Banksian Cockatoo, but it did not look
so w r ell as at the last Show.
The Class for Doves and Quails was a failure, only three
lots being present, though there were eleven entries. The onlj r
birds worth noticing were a pair of Wonga Wonga Pigeons
belonging to Mr. Housdeu. but they were hardly in Show form
and were sent in an unsuitable cage.

The Weaver Class contained a specimen of the rare Ploceus
megarhy?ichzis, sent by Mr. E. W. Harper.
In the Class for the rarer Waxbills and Grassfinches, Mr.
L. W. Hawkins, as usual, showed the best birds, amongst which
may be mentioned a Vinaceous or Masked Fire-finch (. Lagonos -
ticta vinacea or L. laruata .),* a Spotted Fire-finch (L. rufopicta&amp;apos;),
and a pair of Black-rumped Finches ( Stictoptera annulosct). Mr.
Osbaldeston sent a pair of Parrot-finches ( Erythrura psittacea),
and a fine Crimson-finch (. Neochmia phaeto 7 i). There were several
pairs of Masked, Tong - tailed, Rufous - tailed, and Gouldian-
finches.
Messrs. Thwaites and Lloyd sent their Indian Crested
Bunting ( Melophus melaiiicterus ), and Mr. Boswell Frostick a fine
pair of Desert Trumpeter Bullfinches (.Erythrospiza githagined).
The Class for Tanagers, Sugar-birds, and Zosterops was
well filled, the most notable birds being a Magpie Tanager
(Cissopis leveriana ) sent by Mr. Theobald, a Tri-colour (Calliste
tricolor ), a Yellow (C. flava ), and another which nobody seems
to be able to identify, f shown by Mr. Townsend. Mr.
Osbaldeston sent a Blue and Black Tanager, Mr. Swan a White-
capped Tanager. Two Blue Sugar-birds (Dac?iis caya?ia), acock
and hen, sent by Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Swan respectively.
The Class for Crows, Pies, Starlings, etc., contained a
Bobolink, a Hunting Cissa, Purple-headed and Green Glossy
Starlings, an Andaman Starling, and a fine pair of Blue-bearded
Jays.
The Class for Hybrids consisted of three exhibits, the
only birds worthy of note being a very interesting pair of hybrid
Parrakeets, bred from a Redrump and a Rosella. They were
exceedingly beautiful birds, showing much more of the Redrump
* I am not certain which species this is, but I may state that these little Fire-
finches are more often imported than is generally supposed; I once picked out six from
a lot of common Firefinches in a dealer's shop. A lieu of this species was shown by
Mr. Franz as a hen "Australian Fire-finch."
t This bird is the same that appeared at the October Show, which, in my notes in
this journal last mouth I said looked like Tanagra palmarum. In the much better
light at the recent Show however, it was evident that it did not belong to this species,
and I think it is more likely to prove to be either T. cana or T. cyanoptera.

This beautiful crested Tinamou, scientifically known as
Calodromus, Calopczus, or Eudromia elegans, inhabits Western
Argentina and Patagonia. The Zoological Society has possessed
it on many occasions, and it has bred in the Gardens two or
three times. I am not aware, however, of any complete account
of the nidification of the species having been published in this
country, but in the Bulletin de la Societe Nationals d'Acclimata-
tion de France for October, 1903 (for a copy of which I am
indebted to our Honorary Member, Dr, P. L. Sclater) appears
a detailed account by M. Dulaurier, of the nesting of this
species in his aviaries. He tells us that most of those imported
arrive in bad condition, and it is difficult to acclimatise them;
but after several fruitless attempts he at last obtained some.
To keep them in good health the author found that it was
important to give them plenty of green food such as young
grass and groundsel. During the Spring the male frequently
uttered his piercing cry of two or three notes; he also became
very excited, following the hen and keeping an eye on the
shelter, under which she layed her eggs, and covering them
carefull} 7 after each laying. He alone undertook incubation and
the rearing of the young.

eggs were laid that it was found necessary to give the first twelve
or fifteen to a domestic hen, the remainder being left with the
male Tinamou. The hen did not sit well, and several died
when young.
In the Spring of 1903, M. Dulaurier tried two males to the
one female, and he considers that three might have been better
still, as the female lays a fresh clutch to each male.
At first the two cocks fought and pursued the hen who
laid thirteen eggs, but neither of the males would sit, and the
eggs when placed under a domestic hen were found to be clear.
One male was then removed, and the hen paired with the other
and laid six eggs, upon which he immediately commenced
to sit. The hen was then allowed to be with the other cock, and
laid another clutch of eight eggs, but this cock was disturbed
by some Tragopans and did not hatch.
We are told that the young Tinamous can be reared in the
same way as young Pheasants.
The fact of the female pairing successively with two males
seems to me to be of very great interest. The subject of
Polyandry in birds appears to have been somewhat neglected
by ornithologists, but I am much disposed to think that it may
take place more often than is supposed in species, in which the
male performs the duties of incubation and the rearing of the
3'oung. *
In an account I gave of the breeding of Turnix tanki
(.Bulletin of the B. O. Club. Vol. XIII. p. 72), I remarked that
the female, after laying her clutch of three eggs, took no further
notice of the nest, but went about "apparently in search of another
husband." I am much inclined to believe that had there been
another male available she would have paired with him and laid
a second clutch, which he would have incubated. I have
noticed moreover in the case of theTataupa Tinamou ( CrypUirus
tataupa), that when the male is sitting the female often calls.
She is not wanted any more for the first clutch, and it seems
probable that she would, if she could, go off and find a second

mate, to whom she would lay a second clutch of eggs, which he
would proceed to incubate. At any rate M. Dulaurier has
shown that Calopezus elega?is is polyandrous in captivity at least,
and the subject is one that ought to be taken up by aviculturists.

The six young Black Swans hatched at the end of last
month are mostly still alive and doing well; a marvellous instance
of the hardiness of this species, considering that the parent pair,
which hatched two young (which were lost) in the middle of
April, have only a small un grassed paddock and a mere round
basin of a pond. The Black Swan evidently shares the
adaptability to confinement so characteristic of Australian
birds as a whole.

HAMPSHIRE.
The following very interesting story of a pair of Ring-necked
Parrakeets (Palceornis torquata) is the substance of a lecture delivered in
Lancashire by the Rev. H. P. Edge, Rector of Stratfield Turgiss, in
Hampshire,1 It was printed in the Hants, and Berks. Gazette , of September
12th, 1903, and has been brought to our notice by the President of this
.Society, who has obtained the Author's permission for its publication in the
Avicultural Magazine.
" Since the pair in my possession became mine they have never had
an hours illness. They are 'never sick,' and 'never sorry,' are 'as
hardy as Pigeons,' as 'docile as dogs,' and as faithful as Jonathan. During
the inclement weather experienced in January last they were housed in a
thatched coach-house, and were as serene and joyous in their surroundings
as they are in the month of June, when at liberty, and free to roam wherever
they choose. Their food consists of hemp seed, sunflower seed, melon
seed, fruit, soaked bread, etc., but under no circumstances is animal food
permitted. The subjects of this paper were about two months old when I
bought them. Though I have had them, now, for more than five years, I
have not seen the cock drink water more than half-a-dozen times, and then
only on hot, sultry days. The hen frequently drinks in the summer time,
and occasionally has a bath--which is provided for her--but I have never
yet seen the cock bird perform any ablutions in a bath, and yet the plumage
of both is perfect--as close and as glossy as that of any game cock in
'fighting feather.' It has been suggested that they bathe in the river
'Loddon' close by. I question it. In showery weather, however, they
perform the most fantastic evolutions in the trees. First depending from a
spray by one claw, they then spread out their tails and wings to receive the
moisture, very much after the fashion of Fantail Pigeons, though the
fashion of the Parrots is decidedly more graceful.
" By the way. I have a pidture before me of one of these Parrakeets
holding a morsel of food in his right claw. A friend observed to me, two
years ago, that some writer on the habits of birds had stated that the
Parrot tribe rarely or never used the right claw to convey food to the beak.
After being supplied with this piece of information, I have narrowly
watched my two birds, and never yet seen them utilize their right claws.
The left are invariably used.
" I11 the summer after my return from India in 1898, the cock and lieu
were placed in a large, though roughly constructed cage, which was
unfortunately, in the day time, placed in the open air, and, at night, as a
rule relegated to a coach-house which has a thatched roof. One morning a
hue and cry was raised that the cock had escaped from his quarters and

was flying about in the drive. The whole of that day was spent in
endeavouring to coax him back, but without avail, and he spent the night
in the trees. Next morning, however, owing to the pangs of hunger, he
allowed himself to be caught, and returned to bis domicile. Shortly after
this a friend of mine came to stay at Turgiss who persuaded me to let both
birds out of the cage, in order that they might exercise in the open. They
disported themselves for some time in the trees near the house and then
betook themselves to some elms in the glebe, keeping up a continual
screeching until nightfall--obdurate to all blandishments. Then bedtime
came, and with it--no end of self-reproaches for mv temerity in granting
them their freedom. About four o'clock next morning, however, I heard
their well known cries in the garden, and to make a long story short, after
the whole strength of the establishment had been enlisted, they were
decoyed into 'sanctum.' After this, the} 7 were allowed their liberty once
or twice a week--little difficulty being experienced in securing them in the
evening. At length in June 1S99 they were suffered to roam at their own
sweet will, without being caged at all, until the end of the following
October. They slept sometimes in an apple tree, sometimes in a chestnut,,
but most frequently in one of the elms, and I noticed they never chose
the same tree for two successive nights.
" During the period of four months' absolute liberty, they presented
themselves regularly, about 6 o'clock every morning, at a certain window,
where food was always awaiting them. They were fed again at 10.30, in one
of the fir trees, and then finally for the day at 5.30. At first, when uncon-
ditional liberty was accorded them, they confined their attention to the
garden and the drive ; but, by degrees they cultivated a more extensive
knowledge of their surroundings--flying sometimes for a distance of four
or five miles, but always returning home about 5.30 in the evening.
"At the end of October, 1S99, chiefly because shooting is in full swing
for the following month, they were recaged, and not suffered to roam,
again until the Spring of 1900.
"Their daily habits, at this juncture, are much as follows. They are
fed in their cages, which stand in a coach-house, about 8 o'clock in the
morning. At 10 o'clock they are released. Directly the cage doors are open
they exercise for about 10 minutes--flying very often at a great height in the
air, and at a great speed: then after swooping down, in a graceful manner,,
on to one of the trees, they come to me for half-an-liour's chat, or indulge-
in a little love making.
" They have unlimited space at their disposal--twenty acres of glebe,
a large area of arable and grass land, and a noble park in which is some
of the finest timber in England, ' and nobody says them nay.' I have heard
it said that the flight of the Parrot is swifter than that of any other bird.
Having daily opportunities, at this season, of comparing the flight of my

&quot;birds with that of Pigeons, Martins, Swifts and Hawks, I unhesitatingly
say that the four species just enumerated are 'not in it.' The Parrots
' have it ' by a long chalk. They are not accustomed to keep on the wing
for any great length of time; but they go at an astonishing rate, and
'chatter all the way.' I11 clear, cold weather, they rise to great heights
--quite as lofty as that at which the Swifts ordinarily fly--and then make
for a certain point. The cock and lien fly close together.
" Though the birds in my possession are fully paired, and admirable
friends when at liberty, yet experience proves that it is undesirable for
them to&amp;apos; occupy the same cage. Consequently they have separate cages.
There is ample and exalted precedent for all this. The fact is the cock is
somewhat tyrannical. He keeps his ' Missus ' in first-rate order. Outside
he is a perfect angel.
" One of the prettiest sights is to see the cock feeding the hen. This
takes place either on the grass or on the branch of a tree. The prelude to
the fact is exceedingly graceful. First the cock advances toward his mate,
and retires, then again an advance is made, and then a retrograde move-
ment, and, then, arching his neck above that of his wife, the two beaks are
united.
"I have never taken much pains to make my 'specimens'
accomplished linguists. The conditions under which they are kept
preclude their becoming apt orators, though both of them do " orate." If
you want a Parrot to become a great talker, you must keep him iu a small
cage, and cover him up a good deal, until he has learnt the lesson you are
desirous of instilling. So with Canaries and other song birds, I believe.
But I am quite content with them as they are. Oddly enough, however,
the hen is a more proficient linguist than the cock. Sometimes she will sit
on the branch of a tree or the sill of a window--looking at herself in a
glass--and repeat, with evident satisfaction, all the short sentences she has
ever learnt.
" Half a mile from my house my Churchwarden and his wife and
family reside. My feathered friends are very fond of visiting at Yew Tree
Cottage; in fact, when the cock and hen have exceeded their ordinary time
for roosting, I always charge the former with 'gallivanting with Mrs.
Taylor.' Well, there is always a plentiful supply of fruit at this house in
the summer, and in the autumn a plethora of holly&amp;apos; berries and haws, to
both of which they are partial. One day I called at Yew Tree Cottage, in
\0x25A0company with ' Bill,' a fine bull terrier. We had been preceded by the
two Parrots which were busily employed iu devouring holly berries.
Directly Bill and I appeared on the scene down flew the cock-bird at my
feet from the holly bush, and looking up in my face in a sagacious manner,
*exclaimed twice, ' Well, here's old Bill! ' He never used the expression
before, and has never used it since.

Rev. H. P. Edge,
"There is one question with which I am invariably confronted, after
chronicling their habits, and it is this -- 1 Don't the other birds molest them
when they are out of doors?' When first they were at liberty, they w'ere
often pursued by Starlings, Chaffinches, and, of course, Sparrows, although
their most persistent persecutors were a pair of Barbary Doves, which bred in
the fir trees, but now not a single bird resents their introduction to North
Hants. Nay, some of the song birds, such as Blackbirds and others, such as
Starlings, offer them distinct adulation; if it be that ' imitation is the
sincerest flattery.' I have heard a Starling imitate their cries to such a
nicety that, for a moment, I have been deceived. A Blackbird last year
imitated them, too, with such good effedt that both the cottagers and
the children observed the fact. All birds imitate more or less and I think
that ornithologists will agree with me when I say that Thrushes, for
instance, in districts where the Nightingale abounds, catch, to a large
extent, the notes of that songster, and that hence the song of a Hampshire
Thrush is possessed of greater volume and sweetness than that of a
Lancashire Thrush.
" These Parrots of mine readily make friends with those for whom I
have affection, and as readily avoid those whom I don't care about. For
some they have a distinct aversion. I know of one lad in particular whom
they can't abide at any price. Directly he appears they set up a discordant
note, and flee away, terrified. Strange to say, my two dogs can't endure
him either.
" 'Jack' and 'Jill'--for those are their names--though strangely
enough I never address them by their names--have little or no fear. For
cats they have the most supreme contempt. I once saw them feeding off a
plate on the lawn with three cats, and, when probably those quadrupeds
displayed a vulgar greed, drive them all away.
" I have two of the finest bull terriers in England--a dog and a
bitch--' Bill' and ' Loo.' Both these Parrots have a fond admiration for ' Bill,'
They will fly' on to his back--which is permitted, but when they proceed to
examine his toes, 'Bill' is a little resentful. By the w ay, 'Bill' is very
jealous of them.
" These birds may be said never to appear to better advantage than
when rollicking in an apple or gambolling in a plum tree at the beginning
of September, but the spectacle ' after the feast ' is such as to evoke strong
language from even the most pious and patient of gardeners. Not content
with my own apple trees, like children, they ' think everybody else's bread
is better than their own,' and persist in paying flying visits to all the
orchards round, and devouring, or rather wasting the fruit. It speaks
volumes for the kind forbearance of my neighbours when I add that never
yet have they been ill-treated, and but seldom interfered with. The
question of acclimatization, therefore, is an open one. They are delightful

pets, but terrible marauders, and tlieir introduction in large numbers into-
England might be a curse and not a blessing.
"A number of Cockatoos were turned out in a park in Hampshire
some years ago, and the project proved successful, but they were all shot,
eventually, by first one Cockney sportsman and then another.
"My Parrots will fly after me along the roads, and across the fields, for
a couple of miles and more--now hovering above my head, now flying on to
my shoulders, now on to an oak tree, now on to a fence, then on to the
ground at my feet--chattering all the time. Last October, in company with
a friend, I called upon the Vicar of a neighbouring parish, who lives two
miles distant from me. Our homeward journey lay through a beautiful
copse--' Cattle Copse '--where are ' cedar and pine and fir ' and
'branching' hawthorn, the deciduous trees at that time gorgeous in
autumn attire. All at once, if you please, out flew the two birds from a
hawthorn bush where they had been feeding. They had no doubt followed
my friend and me--unknown to us--for a couple of miles, and were await-
ing our return. Mutual salutations over, they then accompanied us home
--now on our heads and shoulders, then at our feet. Sometimes they would
allow us to get ahead for some distance and then enjoy the fun of catching
us up.
" At the beginning of last February they visited a neighbouring
Rectory--a few miles off. Having entertained the school children, who
were enjoying their dinner time, for half an hour or so, they started for
Turgiss. I happened to be walking by a footpath, through some fields,
midway between my house and that which the Parrots had been visiting,
when, all at once, I heard the well-known chatter. There, at a great height
in the air were the Parrots. They recognized me and the bull terriers at
once, and then made the most delightful swoop down, and settled--one on
my right and the other on my left shoulder.
" Between Rectory&amp;apos; and Church twenty acres of glebe and two large
fields intervene. On a Sunday morning, after service is over, they are
almost invariably holding sentinel in one of the trees which surround the
house. Directly I pass through a wicket gate, they are ' ware of it ' and fly
to meet me, across the glebe, in an abandonment of delight.
"Some naturalists have been of opinion, I believe, that birds have a
sixth sense. The probability is illustrated in this way. A camel dies in the
desert. No Vulture was near when the death struggle took place, but
the body of the poor creature is not long without company. Presently
a dot is observed in the sky. This gradually comes nearer and nearer and
proves to be a Vulture. Well it is argued that it is highly improbable that
the bird could either see or smell the carcase of the camel, and that hence
there is some undiscovered sense peculiar to birds. Now if I go away from
home for a day or two, and return late in the evening, these birds

know perfectly well that I have returned long before they either see
or hear me the following morning. I know that they are cognizant of my
return by the peculiar noise they make. It is said that the sense of smell in
Parrots is accentuated. Well it may be, but I hardly think this is the
solution. It is impossible that they can see through half-a-dozen brick
walls--unless, as Mr. Samuel Weller said at the famous trial, they had a
magnifying glass of extra million power. I am inclined to think that
there is something in this 'sixth sense.'
"Of course it goes without saying that their five years' sojourn in
Hampshire has not been without vicissitudes. On one occasion, they had
flown about three miles from my house, and were resting on the branches
of a tree. Three men, who were working near, were endeavouring to catch
them, when, fortunately, a friend of mine happened to be passing on his
bicycle and observed what was being done. Leaving his machine in the
road, he went to the men and rebuked them. They desisted, and Jack and
Jill reached home in safety.
"A duplicate of this affair was enacted close to our Church a month or
two after what has just been related transpired. Three strange workmen
were uniting their efforts to catch them, when a parishioner at work in a
neighbouring field took in the situation, left his work, and expostulated with
the would-be poachers. To their credit, be it said, they relinquished their
intentions, and again Jack and Jill flew home once more.
"During the summer of 1902, there were many indications that my
birds would set up house-keeping. Again, so early in the season as the
beginning of March last year, everything pointed in that direction. The
hen tried two or three times to make her way into the thatch which covers
the barn, but the project has so far been abandoned.*
"More than once, I have been asked-- 1 Do you ever carry anything
about with you, in order to induce these birds to follow you ? ' In Paris--I
have never seen the sight in London--I have often seen in one of the
squares there half-a-dozen Sparrows settle on the arm of a man, and evince
no fear. Some people will tell you that the man has something in his
pocket by which he attracts the birds, as rats are attracted by oil of aniseed.
I do not believe it for a moment. I certainly do carry one commodity but
only one, and that is love--'and perfect love that casteth out fear'--but I
carry nothing else. It is all comprehended in that word."
* If Mr. Edge were to have some suitable nesting boxes or hollow logs fastened up
in the trees the birds frequent, there is little doubt that the Parrakeets would breed
successfully, and a brood of young- Ring-necks, reared in the open, would be a delightful
sight.--E d.

Sir,--I t may interest some of your readers to hear some account of
the past year's nesting season in my outdoor aviary. When I left for
Scotland on August 19th the following birds all had nests and were sitting
in the bushes outside the building. A pair of Golden-breasted or Zebra
Waxbills. The young ones were just hatched when I left and now three
young ones are flying about, pictures of perfect healLli and plumage.
In the first nest of Cordon Bleus there were four young ones, but one
wet night they&amp;apos; were all drowned. After I left they built again, hanging
their nest, made of dry grass, to the four fronds of a common fern. They
brought out two young ones, one of which died last week. The other is
very well and just beginning to show the cock's red patch on its cheeks.
The Orange-cheeked Waxbills also made a nest and brought out
some young. I can't tell exactly&amp;apos; how many as they were hatched after I
left home. I think there must have been three.
The Common Grey African Waxbill built under a stump on the
ground ; the nest was just like a ball made of fine grass and lined with
feathers--it was almost impossible to find the opening. They reared three
or four, but again I cannot tell the exact number. My man saw the young
birds of both of these nests after they began to fly&amp;apos;, but did not count them.
I have also ten young Saffron Finches flying about, several Zebra
Finches, and two young Bullfinches, the parents being a German cock and
English hen. The young ones, both cocks, are magnificent.
My Nicobar Pigeons, which I have had for four years, adopted a
young Grey&amp;apos; Ring-necked Dove two or three days after it was hatched, drove
away the parents and brought it up. About the same time they made a
rough nest (which they had never done before) of sticks and laid one egg.
They did not sit on it, but adopted the Dove instead. I put the egg under
a common Pigeon, hoping it would hatch, but it was clear.
My&amp;apos; pair of Red-headed Gouldian Finches hatched, in October, two
young ones in a travelling box cage which was hanging on a branch. Just
as they were beginning to feather, a Half-moon Parrakeet got in, pulled
both out and killed them ; it was most unlucky, he must have slipped in
unnoticed through the door.
I think that in spite of the wet summer I have reason to be satisfied.
I have now brought in and put in the conservatory&amp;apos; aviary for the
winter, one pair Scarlet Tanagers, one Green Bulbul, two Gouldian Finches,
four Cordon Bleus, and a Pin-tailed Nonpareil ; the latter is now in most
glorious plumage, having moulted perfectly outside. I got him in Paris last
March and he has been out ever since, but I did not know whether he would

stand our winter. Next year I hope to be able to give a more accurate
account of the young birds as I have recently entered in a book every bird
I have, and mean to enter all purchases, sales, and deaths, so that there can
be no doubt in future as to the number of young birds reared. I enclose a
list of my birds, but if it makes this letter too long, pray omit it.* Outside
in the Park I have one Rhea, one Common European Crane, and one
Flamingo. These are out all the winter and are shut in only at night in
their shed. I should feel much obliged if any of your readers could advise
me where to get Flamingoes and their probable price.

SPONGE-CAKE FOR INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS.

Sir, --Will you be so good as to tell me your opinion of ordinary
sponge-cake as a food for soft food eating birds ? I have several birds:
Wliite-cheeked Bulbuls, Pekin Robins, etc., that have been fed for some
time on a mixture of bread, biscuit, preserved egg, ants' eggs and dried
flies, equal parts, of which they ate a considerable amount, but lately I
moved them into another aviary where, amongst others,were some Tauagers
which were supplied with sponge-cake; now they will eat nothing but the
sponge-cake so long as there is any, and if there is enough they do not
touch the other mixture. Do you think that the sponge-cake alone is
sufficiently nourishing for them (with a little fruit) or ought I to remove
the sponge-cake and so make them eat the other ? At present I have
removed the Tauagers and give them a little sponge-cake. Also is sponge-
cake with fruit a sufficient diet for the Superb Tanager? it was what I was
recommended, and I have never seen it touch the other food.
Richard H. Witjmot.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Wilmot:
I believe that sponge-cake or Madeira cake is excellent, as a change,
for Insectivorous birds.
This food should contain a large proportion of egg, which is generall} r
regarded as the most important item in foods for insect-eating birds; but,
as a matter of fact, I believe that the colouring of sponge and Madeira
cakes is largely due to saffron.
It is certain that Insectivorous birds are not much affected by the
absence of ants' eggs or dried flies from their food; for I have tested them
for six months at a time, when ants' eggs have been scarce in the market;
but to deprive them of egg would I believe soon be fatal, unless something
equally nutritious could be substituted.
Therefore, as the quantity of egg in these cakes is doubtful, I should
advise yon to give, both to your Tauagers and the other birds, either Grade

HYBRID ;-NUTMEG FINCH X SILVER BILL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998658428571429" page_id="32958751"  page_num="Page 115" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- For the past three years I have kept Silver Bills, Zebra Finches,
Nuns and similar small birds practically in a wild state, they having access
to a flight of over 100 ft. long, about 50 ft. wide, and 12 ft. high, with plenty
of growing shrubs and fruit trees to nest in.
Along with these smaller birds I keep a few large ones, such as
Cardinals, Virginian Nightingales, Tauagers, &amp;c., and have found in this
sized aviary that the larger birds do not molest the smaller ones, but allow
them to breed freely, and I have successfully reared nest after nest without
trouble; and even now as I write (November 7) I have two nests of young
Zebra Finches in the open (nests in peach trees growing against a wall),
while another young brood of four are flying about fed by their parents.
In Jill}' last my stock of Nutmeg Finches dwindled down to one cock
bird, owing chiefly I believe to their getting into my fish-ponds for a bath
and being drowned. I noticed that this single bird appeared to be on very
friendly terms with the Silver Bills, but thought nothing of it until I saw
him apparently feeding young in a Silver Bill's nest; and, to my delight,
shortly afterwards I saw three young birds flying about which were certainly
a cross between the Nutmeg and a Silver Bill.
Not having heard that such a cross had been obtained before, I wrote
to our Honorary Secretary on the subject, and at his request now submit
particulars of the young birds. Their general appearance and actions are
very similar to those of the Silver Bill, but with the markings and colours
of the Nutmeg distinct upon their forehead, chin, throat, and foreneck,
while the beak is neither so light in colour as the Silver Bill's, nor so dark
as the Nutmeg Finch's.
the Nutmeg markings continue right along under the wings, getting
more distinct over the lower part of the back and rump; while the tail
feathers, instead of partaking of the golden-bronze colour of the Nutmeg,
have turned to almost a jet black since the moult.
In size the hybrids are rather larger than a Silver Bill, but stouter in
body and build; while the one I have before me now has one pure white
feather among the primaries of the left wing; the eyes are slightly larger
and bolder than the Silver Bill's. *
H. B. Rabbich.
Is not this a new hybrid?--R. P.

What is a small Tanager I bought in Genoa the other clay ? The size
of a Superb Tanager but slimmer, blue crown, ami Venetian-red cheeks and
nape; body, &amp;c., green. Hubert D. Asttey.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Astley:
I should think there can be little doubt that your bird is the Festive
Tanager (Calliste Jestiva) : the lesser wing-coverts are said to have a slight
orange bar across the tips which you do not mention, but your bird may be
a female, which is a little duller in colouring than the male.

The following reply has been sent to a Correspondent in reply to a query:
I have always found the best food for Saffron-finches when breeding
to be crumb of stale household bread 2 parts, crushed sweet biscuit 1 part,
yolk of egg and ants' eggs, of each 1 part, slightly damped.
I reared Ribbon-finches (Cutthroats) without trouble upon Abrahams'
Insectivorous bird-food without any admixture: they threw one young one
out of nests which contained uneven numbers; but probably these were
dead before they were removed. A. G. BUTTER.
THE GREY-WINGED OUZEL: COVERING SINGING BIRDS:
THE CALCUTTA ZOO.
Sik,--I was very interested to see * that a Grey-winged Ouzel had
been imported safely to this country. I know these birds well in Kashmir,
where they breed almost on the snow-line. I bought one in Srinagar,
paying nearly the equivalent of a sovereign for it, a large price, but it is
extremely difficult to get natives to part with a good singing-bird or a
talking Mynah.
The bird I bought was in a small dome-shaped wicker cage, covered up
with a cloth, and sang beautifully. Nearly everything is done by Easterns
the opposite way to Europeans. Here we cover a cage to stop a bird sing-
ing, there they uncover the cage to stop singing. Later on, however, I put
the bird in a large cage which was never covered, and he sang beautifully.
I took him to India from Kashmir; and during the lovely "winter" in the
North West Provinces, which is warmer than any days we have had this
summer in England, the bird never sang a note and seemed to feel the cold.
I took him to Calcutta when we went there, and during the hot weather--
and it was desperately 7 hot--the bird sang without ceasing from 5 a.in. till
6 p.m.
The native who had him before me fed him entirely on sattoo, which

is a species of powdered hemp I think, mixed with ghee (clarified butter).
This was squashed into a small jar about three inches high and was of the
consistency of soft cheese, and was only renewed once a zveek. The bird
was in lovely feather and as fat as could be, although he did not eat as
much as a Robin. I fed him on chenna, ghee, bread crumbs, an occasional
scrap of banana and shreds of meat, and earthworms ; and his particular
delicacy was to be given one of the enormous snails which abound in Fort
William, Calcutta : he would spend the whole day digging it out. The bird
was very tame.
I gave him away to the Calcutta Zoo, on leaving India, and he was
very well the last time I heard of him. He fed very freely while with me,
and drank and bathed a lot.
The curious custom of keeping singing-birds in the dark seems
universal in India. A friend of mine had the best singing Sliama I ever
heard. He had had it for years, and during the first few years it was never
uncovered. One day, however, the cover was accidentally left off, and he
found the bird singing hard, so after that the poor little fellow sang in the
sunshine instead of the darkness.
You will hardly credit it but 1113- friend assured me that this Sliama
was fed exclusively on lice. An old native came dai^ with a tin of these
awful vermin, not only for this bird but for various other Shamas in the big
houses round.
I wish I had brought a GreA&amp;apos;-winged Ouzel home. In case aii} r of
your readers should think of sending for one or two, please note that it is
called " Kostura " in the East. They are the loudest and most varied
"Whistlers" of any bird I know.
The Calcutta Zoo. is a splendidly run place. The bird aviaries are
lovel}% all of them with a large circular outside fight, grass, running water,
stones and trees.
The baboo in charge is a most interesting and highly educated man,
and a very keen naturalist.* He has travelled he told me to nearly every
Zoo. in Europe to pick up hints, and the result is that he is gradually&amp;apos;
making the Zoo. there as perfect as it is possible to be.

The earliest records I can get are from the "Irish Nationalist" of
1893, when six were shot, in 1S94 one was shot and one caught alive, and in
1902 another bird was shot. This brings us up to date 1903.
In October one was shot near Lurgan.

<bodyText confidence="0.948525263157895" page_id="32958754"  page_num="Page 118" year="" vol="">
Referring to the Rev. C. D. Farrar's " Record " which was published
in our October Number, at page 407, the following communication has been
forwarded to us by our Member Mrs. Oswald Webber:--
The aviary has been formed by wiring in a portion of a verandah
round my home in Yorkshire, on the south side. Beyond the protection
afforded by the wall of the house and the roof of the verandah, it is quite
open. The finches (African Firefinclies) were turned in, to the best of my
recollection, in the spring of 1889. Before long they built--as far as I can
remember the nest was placed on a ledge in the roof, but how it was con-
structed I cannot remember.
I believe only one egg was laid, which was duly hatched, one young
bird appearing, which flew about the aviary with its parents.
Towards autumn the three birds, one by one, disappeared, escaping
through the meshes of the wire. The young one might have been about
four months old. T. WEBBER.

I picked up in the garden yestei&amp;apos;day a Bee-eater in a very emaciated
condition ... it was alive and did not attempt to move, but died during
the night. I have made a very rough outline of it and named the colours.
The measurements are correct--natural size. Can you identify it !

We are indebted to Captain Shelley, author of " The Birds of Africa,"
for the follozving reply:
The bird is Dicrocercus furcatus (Cat. B.M. XVII. p. 42). Here Sharpe
recognises two species. Reichenow (Vog. Afr., II., p. 315) separates the West
African form as D. chrysolaimus (Jard. &amp; Selby).
I have to invent English names for nearly all the African species. A
good generic name for the three species is "Swallow-tailed Bee-eaters";
and for the specific name I would suggest the pi-efix of Nile, Senegal, and
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.4332595" page_id="32958755"  page_num="Page 119" year="" vol="">
Natal, thus :
D. furcatus -- Nile Swallow-tailed Bee-eater.
D. chrysolaimus -- Senegal Swallow-tailed Bee-eater.
D. hirundineus = Natal Swallow-tailed Bee-eater.

The two northern forms are distinguished from D. hirundineus by the
blue forehead, but to indicate this character would make the English
name too long. G. E. Sheeeey.

I11 the last number of this Magazine we stated that this discussion
must close, and we do not intend to reopen it; as, however, our note at the
foot of Dr. CreswelPs letter may have been rather misleading, we publish
the following extract from a letter received from that gentleman :
The point I emphasize is not so much that " yolk of egg is infected by septic bacilli
more readily than most substances," (although this is probably true), as that when infected,
and when at the same time exposed to the high temperature of a bird's organism, it renders the
descendants of the original infecting bacilli more active in throwing out their special toxins
and therefore more virulent and deadly than those which are commonly met with apart frojn the
influence of egg food.
Dr. Creswell also asks us to correct a printer's error in his last letter
(P. 80, line 30): instead of " Seeing that neither of my pathologist friends,"
read " Seeing that neither any of my pathologist friends," &amp;c.

chronic indigestion].
Hen Kkdrump Parrakkkt (Mrs. Williams). [I should suggest giving the seeds mixed, as

not usually supplied to them in confinement, as I get many of them sent me for
examination in this very emaciated condition.
The Cutthroat had a fit, which was the cause of her paralysis. She died of starva-
tion. There was not a particle of food in her. Your aviary affords quite sufficient
protection for such hardy birds as this and the others you mention. Thanks for kind

St. Helena Waxbill (Captain B. R. Horsbrugh). [Apoplexj&amp;apos; was cause of death. Bird
was very fat].
Bullfinch, hen (Mr. N. S. O'Reilly). [The bird died of fractured skull. The left eye was
dislocated and the feathers above this eye were removed which gives me the idea it
must have flown very hard against the wires, and the beak gone through so the eyes
received the impact. I should watch any doubtful birds as the back of skull was
knocked in which might have been caused by another bird before death ensued from
injury described].
Pii.eated Finch (Miss West). [Broncho pneumonia was cause of death].
Spice Bird (Mrs. Robertson). [Your bird had an apopletic fit just before losinguse of legs,
as the old blood clot was to be seen. The pressure of this on the brain caused
paralysis; another similar fit was cause of death].
Zebra Dove (Miss Ivens). [Jaundice was the cause of death].

THE
BIRDS OF TENNYSON,

Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not alreadv
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' I&amp;apos;he Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it '
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech. '--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos; The Birds of Tennyson.' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge." - Pall Mall Gazette,
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennvson's
poetry, from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manuei. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the gieat influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

GUILDING'S AMAZON PARROT.

<bodyText confidence="0.99638664" page_id="32958769"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Chrysotis guildingi.
By the Honble. and Rev. Canon Dutton.
I have been asked to write a short notice to accompany
the plate of Guilding's Amazon, and so I tell what I have been
able to gather.
I have wished to have one ever since first making the
species' acquaintance at the Zoo, but more on account of its
rarity than for any charm the bird exhibited beyond that of
beauty. To my way of thinking, and I expect I am not singular,
for every one who sees mine leaves the other birds to admire it,
it is the most beautiful, as it is the most distinctive of all the
Amazons. The browns, the yellows, and the blues of the wing
make a superb combination of colour, and the black is singularly
soft in its effect. One asks oneself why has one particular
Amazon departed from the universal green of the family to adopt
brown and yellow in the place of green and red ? Is the
colouring of the island of St. Vincent, where alone this bird is
found, such as to make brown and yellow protective there? The
island of St. Lucia has its own special Amazon ; Dominica has
two, but they do not abandon the green foundation of the family
plumage.
The plate makes it unnecessary to describe the bird's
colouring, but I may as well give the dimensions from the British
Museum Catalogue; which are, Total length about 17 inches,
wing io'6, tail 6-4, bill 1-5. From this it will be seen that it is
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.987893289473684" page_id="32958770"  page_num="Page 122" year="" vol="">
122 The Honble. and Rev. Canon Dutton,
the next largest Amazon to Augusta , whose length is given as 19
inches. It is considerably larger than Versicolor , though the
length of that is 16-5 inches. The tail, it will be seen, is rather
long in proportion to the bird.
The size of the bird is a drawback to it as a pet, as it must
have an unusually large cage, but that does not much matter, as
it is not a bird one often can acquire.
And, indeed, now after the eruptions in St. Vincent, every
one who possesses one says, " Mine is the last of its species." I
know of five " last of their species." One in the Zoo, one
belonging to a lady, my own, and two in the island of St.
Vincent. I had an opportunity of buying one two or three
years ago, but its character was not attractive, and I let it pass
into the hands of Mr. Jamrach.
But the eruption took place since then. If I was to have
it at all, I must " hurry up," and being told that a lady wanted
to sell one which talked, and was " tame and attractive," I
bought him.
His linquistic attainments were not asserted to be more
than " Maud," " Mother," and " Margaret." I can't say that I
ever heard him say even these, but my parlour-maid stoutly
averred that one morning he greeted her with " Hullo, Joseph ! "
which is his name. Nor can I say that with me he has been
" tame and attractive." He sits in a morose lump all day, hardly
eating, and only occasionally climbing about his cage. He gives
one the impression of a bird on its way to become nocturnal, for
he does his eating at night. He cares for nothing special, except
perhaps sponge cake soaked in tea, which he has at five o'clock,
but even that he does not eat with the greed the Versicolor and
Blue-faced Amazons show. And only for that one moment in
the day does he lay aside his readiness to ''go for" me. He
won't look at a peanut; and apples, which I was told he liked, he
hardly ever touches. But I rather think he is a bird of marked
character, and that he will not forgive being separated from his
mistress.
She told me she had had him five years: that these birds
are shot with cork, which stuns without injuring them, and

on Gziilding&amp;apos;s Amazon Parrot. 123
that the native who brought this to her said he had never seen
one in such young plumage. She also told me that he had been
devoted to a small Amazon which one day poisoned itself with
parsley, and that he moped so after its death that she had the
greatest difficulty in coaxing him to eat. That he loved his
liberty (with a cut wing) in the garden, and was very destructive
to the orange trees. He seems to me to feel cold, so he can't
have his liberty at present, and if he is not goingto make friends,
I don't see how he ever is to have it.
He was fond of his mistress, made friends with the English
cook, and was devoted to a black servant. I should have sup-
posed that he declined to make friends with a man, but he shows
no signs of caring for my parlour-maid. I can only suppose
that his heart has been so often "torn with partings " that he
now declines to let it take root any more. He does not care
twopence for the Versicolor or the Blue-fronted Amazon, is
tolerant of the Blossom-heads and a Grey, and was only roused
by a Blue-bonnet. That did really rouse him to fury. He
dashed at the bars of his cage nearest it, and dashed towards me
whenever I approached his cage. And curiously enough, its
presence caused him to go nearer sounds like speech than he
ever uttered before or since. Whether he supposed it to be a
hawk or what, I don't know, but he never got reconciled to its
presence. He is said to be afraid of children, but I have not
brought any to see him. It is rather singular that the " last of
its species" belonging to a lady in Loudon shows the most
unmeasured terror at the sight of a child. She tells me its eyes
start out of its head, it gasps for breath, and that you can hear
its heart beat. That one was at first morose, but has taken the
most dog-like devotion to her, though still savage to all the

Of the two " last of their species" still remaining in St.
Vincent, I am told one, belonging to Mr. Frazer who was him-
self destroyed by the eruption, talks, and that the other is a good
talker. So I suppose they can talk. The "last of its species"
in the Zoo seems to me as morose as mine, which is however a
much finer bird. But if these birds are never reared from the
nest, but only obtained by shooting, there is some excuse for

Mr. Russell Humphrys,
moroseness. Yet the Augusta I had, which was obtained in that
way and is now in the Zoo, is the most friendly of birds, and
learnt to talk readily.
However there is one set-off-- Versicolor , though devoted to
me, won't learn a word, and is intolerably noisy. Guilding's, at
least, is silent, and hardly ever makes a sound.
If he ever should determine to make a friend of me,
perhaps he might do great things. One can always conquer
Grey Parrots and Amazons--at any rate of the larger kinds--by
soundly cuffing them. But I don't want to make the bird afraid
to bite me, but glad to see me. So I still wait. Ret us hope that
" tout vient a-point a qui sait attendre " will come true in this
case.
A RAMBLE IN CEYLON.
By Russell Humphrys.
It is 6 a.m. and a typical July morning as we emerge
Irom the rest-house at Kaltura, and. finding a dilapidated trap
previously ordered in readiness, we prepare ourselves for an
exceedingly uncomfortable journey. Our destination is a patch
of jungle some eight miles away, and our equipment consists of
a butterfly net, collecting box, and a pair of powerful field
glasses. For the first few miles all goes well, the road being
excellent, and passing through the most luxuriant tropical
scenery, the eccentricities of our native driver and his antiquated
quadruped pass unheeded, but on leaving the main road and
striking up a rough bullock path towards the scene of our
intended operations, the entire absence of springs combined
with a seat consisting of a plank of banana wood necessitates a
halt, and we proceed on foot leaving our Jehu delighted at the
idea of spending his day after his own fashion, under the friendly
shade of a cocoa-nut palm.
As we tramp along the side of a large paddy swamp alive
with various aquatic birds, numerous White Egrets ( Herodias
alba ?) are observed usually associating in small flocks of from
ten to fifteen ; they are wary, and the ground being devoid of
cover we are not allowed a very close inspection. Yellow

Bitterns ( ArcLetta sinensis ) and Chestnut Bitterns (Ardelta cinna-
momea ) are also plentiful, and a single Purple Heron ( Ardea
manillensis&amp;apos;) was flushed by our Cingalese attendant. On a
broken bough overhanging a tank a pair of White-breasted King-
fishers (. Halcyon smyrnensis&amp;apos;) were on the look out for their
breakfast, and a little Blue Kingfisher ( Alr.edo ispida ) was hover-
ing over the water, his plumage glistening in the sunshine like
some strange jewel. As we leave the paddy swamp and strike a
native track into the bush, a Red-vented Bulbul (Molpastes
hcemorrhous&amp;apos;) flits across our path uttering shrill notes of alarm,
and after a short search a fully fledged young bird is discovered.
The bait is tempting and a hot chase ensues, which ends un-
successfully from our point of view. Violent exercise in a
temperature of one hundred and something in the shade is not
conducive to good temper ; so smothered in insects of all sorts
and descriptions and prostrated by the heat, we call a halt and
seek solace in a whiff of tobacco. A few moments later we hear
again the musical notes of M. hcemorrhous and the plaintiff call
of their hungry offspring, and are witness to an exciting chase
by both old birds of a particularly fine example of Pompeoptera
criton*, a most beautiful butterfly of black and golden hue. For
perhaps thirty seconds the issue hangs in the balance, but the
combined efforts of the parent birds are eventually successful and
P. criton is brought fluttering to the ground. But such a large
and luscious mouthful is not to be disposed of in a moment, and
ere the coup-de-grace is administered the tables are turned, a large
green net appears upon the scene, a contingency evidently quite
unexpected as, with crest erected and uttering loud cries of in-
dignation, the cock bird endeavours to escape with his prize still
struggling in his beak. But the warning cries of his spouse and
young, combined with the close proximity of the green net,
cannot be ignored, so with a final note expressive of the most
supreme anger the prize is dropped aud subsequently transferred,
luckily practically uninjured, to our collecting box, much to the
delight of our Cingalese attendant, who had suffered more or less
severely conjointly with the writer in the pursuit of " Red-vent
junior."
Probably P. darsius; P. criton inhabits the islands of Batchian and Gilolo.--A. G. B.

Mr. Russell Humphrys,
Our glasses are now employed carefully searching the
neighbouring trees, with the result that numerous tiny Sun-birds
(Arachnechthra minima) are discovered busily employed search-
ing the palm leaves for minute insects--a somewhat similar Sun-
bird but larger, we take to be A. ceylonica ; both species were
plentiful and quite easy to approach. A familiar cage bird in the
English bird market is the Green Bulbul ( Chloropsis jerdoni),
here we observe him at home amidst natural surroundings, and
very beautiful he is. His bright grass green plumage matches
so closely the surrounding foliage as to render detection very
difficult. Another species we observed in this localit)&amp;apos; - was the
Black-capped Bulbul (. Pycnonotus melanicterus ) a bird entered in
our field notes as the Black-crested Yellow Bulbul ( Otocompsa
fiaviventris) ; to an untutored eye the similarity between the two
birds a short distance away is our excuse for the error. Several
examples of the latter bird have been in our possession at
different times, but as Oates and Blanford make no reference to
the occurrence of this bird in Ceylon we conclude it must have
been the former species. Another Bulbul observed, of a dull
olive green plumage, was not identified ; we noted it as being
possibly P. htteolus.
As we emerge from thick bush into a clearing a Drongo
(.Dicmrus ater ) is sitting motionless on a rotting palm stump,
swooping down at intervals to return with some insect to his
perch, and there devour it at his leasure. It being now mid-day
and our collecting box more than half full, we select this spot as
a suitable halting ground and prepare to refresh the inner man,
and afterwards enjoy a short siesta as far as mosquitoes and flies
innumerable will allow.
Reader, during the interval, and while the remainder of
our little expedition are enjoying a well earned repose, we will
borrow the winged sandals of Perseus and journey some
hundred and fifty miles to the hills inland, and alighting in the
neighbourhood of the Botanical Gardens at Peradeniya, at an
altitude of some 1600 to 1700 feet above sea level, continue our
wanderings.

our path, and we hear his companions cooing on all sides. A
pair of Spotted Doves ( Turtur suratensis) are flushed beneath a
clump of giant bamboo, and we catch a glimpse of a small bird
of brilliant black and yellow plumage, but it is not identified. A
family of Wood Swallows (Arlamus fascus) have taken possession
of a dead bough and sit huddled together uttering their peculiar
plaintive call ; occasionally one of their number takes a short
flight in pursuit of some insect, but always returns to nestle close
up to his companions. Here for the first time we note the active
little Ceylonese Loriquet ( Loriculus indicus ) associating in small
flocks of from eight to a dozen birds ; they are very busy and
very noisy, climbing about the tops of the palm trees. We note
that these birds evince a marked partiality for the higher forest
trees.
On the smaller flowering shrubs we notice numerous nests
of the Ceylon Munia {Miinia kelaarti ) but the ones examined
were empty; they were untidy structures composed of dried
grass, not unlike the nest of the Tree Sparrow ( Passer montanus) y
and from the fact that the birds were busy building again we
concluded that we were too early for eggs, or else like the
Sparrow they nest consistently for three or four mouths of the
year, repairing the old nest each time a fresh clutch is laid. In
an area of some thirty square yards upwards of a dozen nests
were discovered, and from the fact that the Nutmeg bird {Munia
punctularia ) was noticed to be equally busy carrying about nest-
ing material, and quite as excited when the nests were examined,
it is possible that the large untidy bundles were the joint efforts
of both species. Another small bird that we noticed plentiful in
the locality was the Ceylon White-eye {Zosterops ceylonensis), in
its movements closely resembling a small Titmouse busily
searching for minute insects.
As we scramble down a steep bank towards the river a
soft mellow note, strangely familiar, greets our ears; we
" cudgel " our brains, where have we heard that note before ?
Visions of the Western Aviary at Regent's Park rise before us,
and we have it--a Barbet,--but although we search diligently
we cannot discover the bird who must have been close at hand,

for we heard him utter his hoarse guttural notes of alarm, and a
few moments afterwards the call is repeated in the distance.
Along the river bank we note the Bee-eater ( Merops viridis )
plentiful in this particular locality ; and a Drongo who, on being
disturbed, displays a conspicuous white rump, we conclude to be
Dicntrus lencopygialis. Close to the banks of the river where the
vegetation was thickest a dull brown Warbler was plentiful; it
was not identified and only seen in this particular locality. The
Ceylon Grackle (Ezilabcs ptilogenys) was also fairly numerous, and
afforded a welcome contrast to the ubiquitous Common Mynah
(.Acridotheres melanosternus) who was en evidence everywhere.
As the afternoon is now far advanced, and twilight in the
tropics of short duration, we will by the aid of our sandals,
transfer ourselves back to the camp, and prepare for the return
journey to Kaltura. A Cingalese brings into camp a young
Snake Eaglet ( Spiloniis melanolis) sewn up in a native basket, its
head protruding from one end, its legs, tied tightly together,
from the other. It was subsequently liberated, placed in an
improvised cage and fed on scalded raw meat and insects. In a
few days it regained the use of its legs and improved rapidly,
and when last seen was on its way to join a collection formed by
an enthusiastic planter on a hill station.
Soon we leave the jungle-clad hills behind, and repass the
paddy swamps on whose placid surface the rising moon is
already casting a silvery sheen, the Egrets and Bitterns have
vanished, Night-jars fly noiselessly overhead, and the bull frogs
are awakening. A few miles farther and we hear again the dull
roar of the surf ceaselessly beating the palm-fringed shore, and
know that we have nearly completed our journey. The soft
notes of the Dyal Bird (Copsychus saularis) are not yet stilled,
and a pair of Brahmitiy Kites ( Haliastur Indus&amp;apos;) are hawking
along the water's edge as we enter the rest-house very tired and
very dirty, but our collecting box is full and our hearts have been
gladdened by the sight of such bird life as does not fall to our lot
every day, so after a bath and substantial meal we smoke the pipe
of peace with all mankind.

The Malabar Thrush, or, as it is now commonly called.
The Idle or Whistling Schoolboy, inhabits the Nilgiri Hills in-
Madras, and is a remarkably handsome and interesting bird,
only a little larger than the English Blackbird, and of a dark
blue-black all over, excepting the forehead and wing-butts,
which are a light cobalt blue. Its nest is made of dry thin roots
and grass, and is generally built on ledges and in dark caves
near little mountain streams, as its food consists of snails, land
crabs, and tadpoles, which inhabit shady and damp spots ; and
thus it can obtain a livelihood more easily.
The Idle Schoolboy's whistle is very human, in fact it is
exceedingly like that of an idle schoolboy wandering through the
woods whistling no particular tune. I have heard some people
assert that its whistle is like that of an organ, very rich and
mellow, but this I cannot vouch for.
The young birds are very difficult to rear, being very
delicate, and require to be fed 011 worms, land crabs, and tad-
poles. The only person I have ever known who has reared them
is a coffee planter in the Nilgiris, where these birds are
numerous ; and he taught them to whistle tunes beautifully with
the help of a flageolet; among other tunes he taught them
"Merrily danced the Quaker's wife" and "Ehren on the
Rhine," which they whistled very well, much to the astonish-
ment of everyone.
He has taken a great deal of trouble with these birds; and
I believe, when they were quite young, he had to sit up several
nights with them to keep them alive.
In the early rains up here (Ootacamund, Madras
Presidency), if you walk along any wooded road or path, you
will hear the Idle Schoolboys singing all around.

This handsome Australian Mannikin, although it has been
known amongst us for several years now, seems to be surrounded
by a certain amount of confusion in the minds of many avicul-
turists as well as bird dealers.
This species and the Chestnut-breasted Finch are often
confounded together though they do not bear very much resem-
blance to one another. Even at the Zoological Gardens, where
one expects the animals to be correctly named at least, a pair of
Munia pectoralis which have been placed with some Parson-
finches in the Insect-house are labelled as " Chestnut-breasted

finches (. Donacola castaneithorax )." * It is to be hoped therefore,
that the cut here given, although the attitude is none too
characteristic, will enable those of our members who do not
know the species to identify it without any trouble.
The Pectoral or White-breasted Finch is an illustration of
the extent to which some Australian species, practically unknown
a few yeai&amp;apos;S ago, have recently been imported comparatively
freely. When Volume XIII. of the British Museum Catalogzie
was written in 1890, this species was represented in the National
Collection by one skin only. In May 1896 a single specimen
was exhibited at a bird-show in Brighton, and this was probably
the first time that this species was exhibited alive in this country,
and marks the commencement of its career as a subject for British
aviculturists. Since these first examples appeared these birds
have continued to come over, though only in small numbers and
at varying intervals. The present writer has possessed altogether
some six or eight specimens, but it is curious that all except
one appear to have been males, this sex being apparently much
more numerously imported than the other.
These birds appear to be hardy and easily kept in health
on a diet of canary and millet seed, though grass in flower is
appreciated and should be supplied when obtainable. I am not
aware of any case of this species breeding in captivity being on
record, though I have seen the pair I now possess carrying bits
of grass in their bills, which may indicate the possibility of a
nest at some future date, if all goes well. I must confess that I
have found these birds uninteresting even for Mannikins ; they
are, as a rule, shy birds, and when any one is in sight they hide
away in the thickest cover they can find. They apparently
possess no song whatever.
Gould gives no notes regarding the habits of this species
in a wild state, for it was only known to him, and first described
by him, from two skins procured by Mr. E. Ding of the " Beagle."
The Calvert Expedition to the North West in 1896-7, met with a
few of these birds, which were shy and difficult to approach. In
* X may here mention that a Parrot-finch (.Ery thrum, psittacca) in the Parrot-house
has been labelled as Efythrura ptasina.

Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens.
the Appendix of his book Nests and Eggs of Australia?i Birds ,
Mr. A. J. Campbell writes " The eggs are long ovals in shape;
texture fine ; surface without gloss; colour white, with the
faintest bluish tinge. A pair from a clutch of four, taken by Mr.
G. A. Keartland, in North-west Australia, measures in inches :
(i) -62 x -43, (2) -6 x -42. The nest was the usual flask-shaped
structure of grass, lined inside with finer material, and was
situated in a bush about ten feet from the ground. Date, end of
February, 1897."
Munia pect oralis appears to be confined to the North-West
of Australia, and it is noteworthy that several species from this
out-of-the-way region have recently come into the English Bird-
market ; I may mention Ptilosclera ^ersicolor, Platycercus browni,
and Trichoglossus rubritorques.
The Pectoral Finch may be thus described : Adult male.
Upper parts lavender-grey, the wings rather more brownish and
spotted with white ; the tail blackish brown ; throat, cheeks and
ear coverts black with a purple sheen, and speckled with minute
white feathers, on the chest a band of black feathers, very
broadly tipped with white, so that the black is hardly visible ; a
line of pale vinaceous buff from the eyes runs down the side of
the neck ; underparts vinaceous buff, the sides being ornamented
with white spots, each spot being edged with a fine black line
above and below ; under tail-coverts more or less spotted with
white; bill lead-colour. The adult female resembles the male
except that the black on the breast shows more distinctly, the
white spots being much smaller. D. Seth-SmiTh.

Tytler's, or the Andaman, Parrakeet is confined to
the Andaman Islands where, according to Hume, it is very
numerous. It is very closely allied to the Nicobar Parrakeet
(P. nicobarica ), and very possibly specimens may have been
previously imported but mistaken for that species. The example
now at the Gardens is recorded as new to the collection.

During May, 1902, I had my first aviary built. Nothing happened
beyond a pair of Doug-tailed Grassfinches making nests in various places,
without the least idea of laying in them. The rest of my birds consisted of
a cock Bearded Reedling, and the survivors of one dozen mixed foreign
finches, which are nearly all hens except two cock Silverbills.
After bringing my birds indoors for the winter, I exchanged one of
the Silverbills for a hen. On December 22nd I found two broken eggs had
been thrown out of the sleeping box on to the floor of the cage which
contained these birds. The hen continued to lay until September 28th,
except when rearing young, and began laying again on November 26th, and
another egg on the 30th, so now she has laid in every month throughout
the year except October.
While in a cage the birds have never succeeded in hatching a single
egg. They would sit for a day or two and then let the eggs get cold.
There was a young bird nearly ready to hatch on February 16th, the day on
which I had to take them back to Fast Hoathly. Plenty of cuttle-bone,
old mortar, and pounded-up uncooked egg shell was supplied, but the eggs
were very brittle and the yolk could be seen from any part of the shell.
The birds were very timid, especially the cock, who used to dash in and
out of the nest-box and make little holes with his claws in the eggs,
spoiling nearly all.
I could find nothing much about the actual nesting of this species in
any of my books, except that the usual clutch of eggs seems to be six or
seven. During their aviary life they did better but wasted a large number
of eggs, and only reared three young birds.
Towards the end of the season I discovered their mode of nesting.
The hen laid two eggs on consecutive days and incubated them immediately.
This I found out during their cage life. After an interval of four or five
days she laid two more eggs, and probably more later on. I have seen both
young birds and eggs in the nest together, but they have disappeared sooner
or later. When the most forward birds have left the nest, never more than

two in my case, what might have been others are only dried up eggs or
dead birds, owing probably to their heavier and older companions having
trampled them to death.
The last brood consisted of one bird, which left the nest on the 15th
of September, and a much younger bird, which I did not discover until
the 16th, with only the tail and wing-feathers just showing. It must have
hatched out later than the first bird, probably from the second pair of eggs.
I found it when cleaning out the nest-box, after the others had flown. The
parents seemed to forget it after that, and the next morning I found it dead
in the nest, probably from cold as there was plenty of food in the crop.
Observations were not easy to take, because I had other birds nesting
close by at the same time.
The chief reason of their not rearing more was, I think, the dirty
state into which their nests got. Some of them seemed to leave the nest
before they could fly properly, and died from exposure during the nights of
last summer. I lost a brood of Long-tailed Grassfinches through a dirty
nest. I pulled all the hay out of their second nest, when the young were
about half grown, and left the parents to reline it, which they did, and all
went well. But these birds are not so timid as the African Silverbill.

Of Bengalese in the aviary my experience has been small, my birds
having been kept almost entirely in cages, where their quaint little ways
showed to great advantage.
During the spring and summer each pair occupied a separate cage,
where they nested with more or less energy and success ; and in the winter
the cocks lived together in one large flight cage, and the hens in another.
They were the smallest birds I possessed at that time, and their white
colouring and gentle ways made them seem too fragile to rough it in the
aviary- among stronger birds.
When Bengalese first arrive in this country they seem rather
delicate: six I bought this summer all died within a few weeks, probably
owing to the cold and damp, as four of them at least appeared to be quite
healthy at first.
When once acclimatized they are fairly hardy, and a high temperature
is not at all necessary to their well-being. My bird-room was between 45 0
and 55 0 in winter and the Bengalese, even in cages, were quite happy. A11
odd lieu, who is still out in my garden aviary, looks bright and cheerful even
when the grass outside is white with frost. Their habit of all crowding into
one sleeping box at night must help to keep them warm. I have seen seven
cocks pack themselves into one cocoanut shell night after night, although

a similar shell hung empty close by. The entrance hole was quite small,
and when five birds were in it seemed impossible for the others to find
room ; but though it generally took them quite a quarter of an hour to get
settled all were safely stowed away at last. I cannot think that any of them
could have found room to move leg or wing all night.
It seemed to me that separating the cocks and hens during the
winter, and giving them rather small sleeping boxes was the best way of
preventing that bad habit to which Bengalese seem specially prone, viz.,
sitting in the nest box for a day or two at a time, with or without an egg as
excuse. Birds that start the season with this failing never seem to lay a
full clutch of eggs, or to sit steadily.
Another difficulty with Bengalese is to persuade them to eat soft food
of any kind. I like all my birds to eat soft food occasionally, it is such a
help in case of illness, and young Bengalese are all the better for it when
first hatched. My birds seemed to feed their young ones on it almost
entirely during the first week of their lives, aud then they gradually
decreased it in favour of white millet.
Bengalese make capital parents, and it is very seldom that a nestling
dies. Four seems to be the usual number in the nest, though I have had as
many as six. When newly hatched the young Bengalese is the tiniest little
thing imaginable--a little pink moving morsel; it lies on its back with head
and legs feebly waving, and it seems marvellous that its parents can manage
to feed such a wee mite.
By putting together birds of different colours I have had chocolate
aud white, fawn aud white, and pure white young ones in the same nest.
These notes have spun themselves out to such a length that I can
only allude to the quaint little song and dance of the Bengalese, which are
not the least of its attractions as a cage-bird.

COCKATOOS.
In my account of the foreign birds at the Crystal Palace Bird Show
(page 69), I mentioned the Banksian Cockatoo being a decided rarity,
seldom seen at bird-shows. Soon after the appearance of these notes,
however, I received a note from Mr. Hamlyn, the well-known dealer in live
animals, informing me that a client of his at Chelsea had several of these
birds flying loose in a large aviary and suggesting that I should go and see
them, which through the courtesy of their owner, Sir Charles Eawes-
Wittewronge, I have since had the pleasure of doing.
A large space outside Sir Charles' studio is wired over with strong

netting; there is a wooden structure, sadly gnawed about, for the birds to
shelter in, and the ground is covered with rough grass. In this huge aviary
are a number of Cockatoos, from the common Rose-breasted (Cacatua
roseicapilla) to the rare Black Cockatoo of two or three species. When we
entered this enclosure Sir Charles extended his arm and called, and down
swooped the most imagnificent Cockatoo I think I have ever seen, and
alighted on its owner's shoulder. This was either the Great-billed Cockatoo
(Calyptorhus macrorhynchus) or the Western Black Cockatoo (C. stellalus),
the latter T am inclined to think. These Black Cockatoos seem to be some

of the most affectionate of Parrots. This one was devoted to its owner, and
allowed him to do anything with it, appearing never so happy as when
allowed to be on his shoulder. I noticed also in this enclosure another
which was evidently the Yellow-eared, or Funereal Cockatoo (C. funereus).
On leaving the outer aviary I was conducted into the studio where
there was an invalid. This was another apparently of the same species as
the very tame one, but showing a number of the brownish feathers of
immaturity. Sir Charles tells me that he finds these Cockatoos very
delicate at first, though when acclimatized they do not seem to feel the cold.
This one had been very ill the day before, but appeared to be recovering
when I saw it.
In ail inner room, fitted up with cages and aviaries and heated by
hot-water pipes were several more Cockatoos of different kinds. Another
black one, smaller than the others was apparently an immature C. banksi.
It was remarkably tame, and an altogether delightful bird. It flew on to
my arm and climbed over my shoulders and rubbed its large beak against
my ears. I was very much struck by the extreme gentleness of these
Black Cockatoos, they seem to be the gentlest and most affectionate
of Parrots, rarely, if ever, using their powerful bills as weapons of offence
or defence. Amongst Sir Charles' other Cockatoos in this room were three
Gangas ( Callocephalon galeaium), two males and a female.

An extremely interesting article by Heer F. E. Blaauw,
C.M.Z.S., on the breeding of some of his Waterfowl at Gooilust
during 1903, appears in the current number of the Ibis. No less
than seven rare species of Geese hatched and reared broods
during the year, these consisting of Cereopsis ( Cereopsis novce-
hollandice ), Sandwich Islands ( Neochen sandvicensis ), Magellanic
(Chloephaga magellanica&amp;apos;), Black-banded (C. dispar), &amp;apos;Ashy-headed
( C. poliocephala ), Ruddy-headed (C. rubidiceps) and Snow ( Chen
hyperborejis). A female Maned Goose (Cheno?ietta jubata) laid two
eggs, which were placed under a common hen which hatched
them, but unfortunately killed both chicks, and a clutch of eggs
laid by a Ross's Snow-Goose ( Chen rossi ) were destroyed by
vermin. A pair of Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccbiator ) reared a
brood of six. Heer Blaauw gives very interesting notes on the
colour of the young of each species, and the following paragraph
strikes us as particularly interesting :--
"In former years I have repeatedly bred young birds
from a male of the Blue Snow-Goose ( Chen ccerulescens) and a
white female of Chen hyperboreus , when the results of the union
have invariably been Blue Snow-Geese, and not specimens
intermediate in plumage between the two forms. This year a
pair of these Blue Snow-Geese (the result of a mixed union) has
bred, and the result has been a brood of four young, all
recognisable at once as true Blue Snow-Geese."

FURTHER NOTES ON CAROLINA DUCKS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999647256410256" page_id="32958787"  page_num="Page 139" year="" vol="">
Sir, --In answering the queries of one of our lady members, I hope
that the additional information, as she suggests, may be of use to others
also; hence my excuse for again intruding with one of my Anatine
favourites. As to the probability of a pair of Carolinas breeding in a wired-
over enclosure twelve feet by six, I can only say that Mandarins will breed,
according to the Hon. Rose Hubbard, in an even smaller space; and
Carolinas used to have the reputation of being better breeders, so that
success is quite possible with these also. It would, however, be better in
such a case to clip one wing, if they are not already pinioned, and let them
out during the day, especially as a shallow weedy pond is available. They
should, however, be gently driven in at night, and fed only at this time;
nor should they be let out till fairly tame and used to their surroundings.
If care is taken they are not likely to stray, unless perhaps about the laying
season, when the}&quot; are apt to get restless, though less so than Mandarins.
The drying up of the pond in summer would not matter, as a very small
tank is enough for ducks like these. It should be placed in their enclosure;
a pan or tub a yard across and a foot deep will do, if some fresh water is
put in daily and the whole emptied out every week or so in dry weather, to
prevent the water getting too foul. A large bath sunk in the ground will
be found to answer excellently. The pond should be seen to, if possible,
when the birds are outside the enclosure.
The enclosure can be made either over grass or shrubs; in the latter
case a turf should be put in every day or so. If a bit of the pond can be
enclosed this would be a very good thing to do ; it might be deepened at
this point, so as to retain more water.
Food should be any small grain--wheat, barley, buckwheat--given
in a trough of water; maize and hempseed may be added in cold weather.
While the birds are confined in the small enclosure a few earthworms or
small snails (about the size of peas) may be given daily.
As to their being bred to profit, this ought certainly to be the case if
a good breeding pair be secured, as food and housing cost little. They are
quite hardy, and a big hutch or kennel littered with straw or moss-litter is
all they need for shelter. To breed a number it is better to have two ducks
to one drake.
In conclusion I may say that our member Captain Boyd Horsbrugh,
A.S.C., has kindly written informing me that a brood of Mandarin-Carolina
hybrids was hatched at the .Stephen's Green pond in Dublin, but unfortu-
nately all, he believes, were killed by a terrier. He does not know which
was the male parent. This at any rate shows that the cross is not so very

HYBRID MUNIAS.
Sir,--I should feel greatly indebted to you if you would kindly tell
me whether there is a known wild hybrid between Munia inaja and M.
atricapilla ; and also whether this cross has been reared in captivity.
I see that in the Avicultural Magazine of June, 1902, Mr. Harper
advertises such a wild hybrid. And in his notes on the Crystal Palace Show
in the Magazine for March, 1903, Mr. Seth-Smith says there was a white-
headed Mannikin with a black throat, which might have been taken for a
hybrid between M. maja and M. atricapilla, but which he believed to be
the Javan form Munia ferruginosa. Is it possible that Munia Jerruginosa
is a cross ? or is it a known species ? I bought two of these birds last July :
they appear to be very fond of each other and always sit side by side, but
so far they have shown no inclination to nest.
D. Hamilton.
The folloiving reply has been sent to Miss Hamilton :
It is quite likely that wild hybrids may exist between Munia maja
and Munia atricapilla, but I thought it strange that Mr. Harper should
advertize such a hybrid, as it could hardly occur in India.
On looking up the advertisement, which was published in July (not
June) 1902, I find that it relates to a hybrid between Munia malacca and
M. atricapilla.
Dr. Russ speaks of the hybrid between M. maja and M. atricapilla
(he calls it M. sinensis) as having been obtained in captivity.
Munia ferruginosa comes from Java, and I believe that M. atricapilla
does not; the British Museum certainly records no examples from that
island: the indistinctness of M. ferruginosa as a species is generally
admitted: it has occasionally been received in the German bird-market in
some numbers ; but, up to 1879 Dr. Russ had not heard of its having been
bred, nor have I heard of a case up to the present time.
A. G. Butler.
[We believe that several examples of M. ferruginosa were received
by dealers shortly after, or at the same time, as the single specimen above
referred to was shown at the Crystal Palace.--E d.]
FEATHER-PLUCKING.
The following reply has been sent to a member&amp;apos;s query :
The cause of feather-plucking in Parrots is well-known ; but when

the habit is once acquired, I believe it is practically incurable unless the
bird can be turned loose in a large open-air aviary.
I think it probable that the varied interests of aviarv-life would
occupy the thoughts of the bird with something more sensible than per-
petually denuding itself; and the comfort of clothing would be more
appreciated in the open air, than in the warmth of a dwelling-room or a
conservatory.
Feather - plucking results from two causes -- incorrect feeding, or
insect-pests: both produce irritation of the skin, to alleviate which the
bird tears out its feathers.
The most certain means to adopt to induce a parrot to pluck itself is,
to give it any kind of animal food. Bird-lovers frequently imagine,
because parrots can be taught to talk, that they may be fed like human-
beings; so they give them milk, butter, cheese, eggs, chicken-bones, fish,
flesh, and fowl.
Another form of food which generally produces vomiting and laxity
in parrots (excepting Lories, Lorikeets, and other honey-feeding parrakeets)
is sop: this frequently results in skin - irritation and feather-plucking.
When breeding, however, it is admitted that soft food, such as bread
scalded with hot water and then pressed as dry as possible, assists these
birds in rearing their young.
A third error in feeding is, to supply advertized mixtures of strange
seeds to all kinds of parrots indiscriminately. Those who know anything
about these birds are well aware that each group requires its own proper
mixture; that to give the same seeds to a Budgerigar, a Lory, a Broadtail,
a Grey Parrot, or a Macaw, is to invite both disease and death.
In " parrot mixtures " the most prominent seeds are pumpkin, melon
or vegetable marrow (which can contain very little nutriment), hard maize,
the germ or bud of the coming plant being the principal part which is
eaten; prairie-grass, sometimes sold under the name of "sorghum" though
it in no way resembles millet; and sometimes sunflower seed. The idea of
the men who make up those strange combinations seems to be that any
large seeds will answer for parrot-food. Feather-plucking is frequently the
result of using these unnatural mixtures.
Insect-pests frequently result from the regular use of covers, to draw
over the cages at night: it is to the use of these that I have to attribute the
unsightliness of my own Grey Parrot, so that I speak from bitter
experience.
I think it possible that, if when a parrot first begins to pluck itself, a
little fluid magnesia is stirred into its drinking-water occasionally, and its
diet is strictly attended to ; the irritation may pass off before the habit of
plucking out its feathers has been formed; and thus it may be cured. I
have heard of such cases.

THE LITTLE LORIKEET.
Sir, -- I enclose a rongli water-colour drawing of a Parrakeet. I wish
you would be good enough to identify it for me. Is it the Little Lorikeet,
Glossopsittacus pusillus ?
The specimens I have were obtained at Goombargana, N.S.W. The
birds were always in immense flocks feeding on the honey from the
blossoms of the Eucalypti , generally so high up as to be out of range of
my collecting gun, and were therefore somewhat difficult to obtain.
Norman B. Roberts.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Norman Roberts :
The Parrakeet is the one you suggest--the Little Lorikeet, Glossopsit-
tacus pusillus. Although a common enough species in New South Wales,
South Australia, and Tasmania, I am not aware of any living specimens
having been brought to this country. There is no doubt whatever that it
would be :io more difficult to keep in health than the Varied Lorikeet
(.Ptilosclera versicolor ) which has now been proved to do well in captivity on
a diet of sweetened sop, or hone)', and fruit.
The Little Lorikeet is said to be almost always found in company
with the Musky Lorikeet (Glossopsittacus concinnus), and to be practically
identical with that species in its habits. It is the smallest of the Lorikeets,
measuring only about 6 |inches in length.

Sir,--I see Mr. Catleugli's experience with a hen Budgerigar trying
to kill her mate.
Many years ago a hen Budgerigar I had did precisely the same thing,
and, if I recollect, tried to murder the young, too. It caused me to give up
breeding them, for I could not say when the avicidal mania might come on,
and I could not be always watching them.
I recollect that with the first pair of Blossom-heads I had, the
husband was always dreadfully hen-pecked until the breeding season came
on, then he asserted his authority, and kept his wife in order.
In Mrs. Johnstone's interesting communication about breeding the
Rock-Pebblers, she talks of the inability of the King Parrot to stand
cold. My experience is that the King Parrot is more impatient of the
atmosphere of a room than that of cold. I11 fact all the Broad-tails seem
to me fairly indifferent to cold, but then I have never kept the northern
forms.
The endurance of cold by Parrots is a rather interesting subject: it
seems to be settled by species rather than by habitat. No doubt a large
number of species of Parrots could stand our climate if they had perfect
liberty.

A GOOD HEATING APPARATUS FOR BIRDROOMS, ETC.
One of the best and simplest forms of heating apparatus for small
aviaries or birdrooms that we have seen was that exhibited by Mr. J.
Dewliurst, of 52 Northern! Road, West Kensington, at the recent Crystal
Palace Bird Show. It consisted of wrought iron flow and return pipes,
connected to a small conical copper boiler which is heated with a Bunsen
gas burner. The boiler has a casing of iron or copper, from the top of
which a small pipe carries off the fumes. There is no heating so good as
that of hot-water pipes, and Mr. Dewhurst's apparatus is the simplest form
of the application of this system that we have seen, and one of our
members who has tried it informs us that it is perfectly efficient. It can be
fitted in any room in a few minutes. The price is #2 10s. with zinc tank
and iron boiler casing, or ^3 with the same in copper.

The following reply has been se?U to a member&amp;apos;s query :
The best food for a Jay consists of crumb of stale household bread,
powdered sweet biscuit, yolk of egg, ants' eggs, and dried flies, thoroughly
mixed together and slightly damped; or, if you wish to save the trouble,
' Century Food' Grade 2, with a little yolk of egg in flake added, and about
two parts of crumb of stale household bread to one of the food, will
answer the same purpose.
Ouce a week a cubic inch of raw beef minced, should be given in
addition to the staple food ; also any mice, young sparrows, or sparrows'
eggs when you can get them ; cockroaches or other insects and their grubs,
spiders or centipedes.
Crack-nuts are much appreciated, or green peas when in season; also
small fruits or banana.
Too much butcher's meat is bad, though fur and feather in the form
of mice and nestling birds (which are natural food) do good, and help to
keep this and the other Crows in good plumage.
I am speaking from experience; as my two Ja}\s (English and
American) are always in perfect health and plumage excepting when in
moult.
The cage for a Jay cannot be too large, as it is an active bird and very
playful ; it also likes to bathe daily.

Will Bower-birds live in an aviary ? If so which species is recom-
mended ? Are they dangerous to other smaller birds ? What should they
be fed on ?
Louisa Feieding.
The following reply has been sent to Lady Louisa Feilding:
If they are properly fed, there is no difficulty in keeping Bower-birds
in an aviary; but during the winter, it must be an indoor one and
moderate^ warm.
I do not think you can improve upon the Satin Bower-bird: I have
had a pair since September 1899 which is now in perfect health and
plumage, the cock never having had a day's illness; the hen however was
ill for three days some months ago, but recovered rapidly after a dose of
castor-oil.
As I keep my birds by themselves in a small aviarv, I cannot speak
from experience as to their behaviour towards small birds; but Mr.
Phillipps tells me that they do not seem to trouble about those much
smaller than themselves, though they dispute rather fiercely with others
more nearly of their own size.*
They should have some soft food : (' Century Food ' would be as
good as any), also plenty of fruit--oranges, ripe pears, or grapes, being
favourites; and insects in some form; cockroaches they like as well
as anything else : they are moderate eaters.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Red-crested Cardinal (Miss Sturton-Johnson). [Apoplectic fit caused the inability to
fly, the wing being partially paralysed by pressure on the left side of brain caused by
extravasated blood in this region. The brain mischief was the cause of death. It
was a cock].
Saffron Finch, cock (Mr. G. C. Porter) [Your bird died of a fractured skull which was
no doubt caused by flying against something hard. Am very pleased to assist you
as far as I am able].
Pope Cardinal (Capt. Rice). [Apoplexy was the cause of death. These birds can do with
plenty of exercise, and should not have many mealworms if confined in a cage].
Pintail Nonpareil (Mr. Picard). [Your bird died of inflammation of the liver. It is
difficult to assign the cause. It may be from chill, although it is difficult to say how
this was contracted].
St. Helena Waxbill (Rev. R. H. Wilmot) [The bird was much emaciated, the cause
being a large tumour in the abdomen].
Mocking Bird (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). [Bird died of concussion of the brain, and there
were several marks of old injuries about the skull and wings. I have had Mocking
Birds all the winter in outdoor aviaries which never seemed to suffer inconvenience
from the weather].
Hen Zebra Finch (Capt. B. Horsbrugh). Died of inflammation of oviduct as a result of
inability to lay the egg].
Budgerigar (Miss Appleton). [Your bird was badly injured on left side of breast and
left leg. It had wasted a good deal owing no doubt to pain].
Red-crested Cardinal (Miss D. Sturton-Johnson). [Your bird died of apoplexy. There
was one extravasation on brain of a few days standing, and one quite recent which
no doubt was immediate cause of death].
Hen Cordon Bleu (Mrs. Barber). [Death was due to haemorrhage of the lung].
Cock Bloodrump Parrakeet (Mrs. Fogg Elliot). [Bird died of pneumonia].
Brown-throated Conure (Miss Sturton-Johnson). [Your bird died from injuries on
side of head. The skull was fractured. It is annoying to lose birds, but one must
never be surprised at such occurrences in a mixed aviary. Some birds that are quiet
for months seem to develop the bullying propensity suddenly, and if successful at
first will sometimes do considerable damage before detected. I have experienced
this with a cock Cockatiel and a cock Californian Quail.

THE
BIRDS OF TENNYSON,
BY
WATKIN WATKINS, B.A.Cantab.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.977859714285715" page_id="32958797"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate&amp;apos;s works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that 'No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the 'feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelitv with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it '
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song&amp;apos; into literary
speech. '--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos; The Birds of Tennyson.' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare. Bvron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in daintv lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
1 here is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

THE
BIRDS OF TENNYSON,

WATKIN WATKINS, B.A.Cantab.

Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Raureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to " The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the &amp;apos; feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech.''--The Globe.
" Rovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos; The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number &quot;of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Rodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" * The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by
G. E. Rodge enhance the value of the volume."--The Shrewsbury Chronicle.

THE SPOTTED GROUND-BIRD.
Cinclosoma punctatum.
{Cat. B. Brit. Mus. VIZ., p. 332 ).
By Reginald Phillipps.
I have been asked to write about Cinclosoma; and as I
am probably the only person in this country who has ever kept
a specimen of the genus alive there is no escape, notwith-
standing that some years have elapsed since my bird lived--
and died ; happily my notes are pretty full.
It was in the afternoon of the 8th July, 1899, that a bird*
arrived, with a letter offering me an "Australian Rock-Thrush."
The name " Rock-Thrush" was associated in my mind with the
Pied Rock-Thrush, Monticola saxatilis, of which I had, and had
had, many examples, and I was vexed that so common a species
should be sent to me. However, on uncovering the box, quite
a different bird was exposed to view. It seemed familiar, but
somehow I could not just manage to get my tongue round the
name; nevertheless it appeared an innocent kind of thing, so
I accepted and placed it in a six-foot cage in my dining-room,
and, drawing up a chair, sat down to study it.
In outward appearance there was nothing startling about
the little stranger, but it was decidedly interesting. Of about
the size and shape of a Turtle-Dove, it had rather a long fan-
shaped tail, a slender black bill, and short pale-flesh-coloured
* I heard later that a pair had started from Australia but that the female had
been "buried at sea."--R. P.

legs and toes. Its various parts, taken by themselves, reminded
me of just so many different species, but when put together
they produced a bird which differed from each and every of
them.
The bird was half crouching on the sand, head, body, and
tail nearly in a straight line, but with the tail-end tilted up the
other depressed ; and thus it remained exactly where I had placed
it, and as rigid and motionless as if it had been a wooden Dove
out of a child's Noah's Ark. The top and back of the head were
brown washed with slate, this colour occupying the whole space
between two much lengthened white superciliary streaks, but on
the forehead and behind the ear-coverts the slate was more
pronounced. The chest, right across from side to side, was
rich blue-slate, and I thought of the Californian Quail, but, on
recollecting that the latter has a crest, I decided rather upon the
Chinese Quail. On the hind cheeks, however, there was a
conspicuous oblong patch of white, and the throat was jet black,
pointing to the familiar Chinese Jay-Thrush, Garrulax chinensis.
But as my eyes wandered over the upper parts, and I gazed 011
the rich red-brown feathers each with a central streak of darker,
I recognised the Alpine Accentor.
On examining the under parts, I found that the blue-slate
chest was sharply bounded below by a thick irregular, or perhaps
double, band of large oval black beads, below which came an
unspotted abdominal region of dull cream, strongly suggestive
of the Sand-Grouse ; but the unspotted centre was bordered by
very thickly spotted flanks, the rich colour of which was un-
mistakably that of the Fieldfare.
I had proceeded thus far with my examination when,
wishing to inspect the bird from a different point of view, I
mechanically reached out my hand in order to give it a twist
round, when it suddenly started up, and marched along the
length of the cage with a gait and movement there was no
mistaking, and with impatient annoyance I ejaculated -- A
Pheasant ; but as the creature stalked solemnly back, each
movement of leg accompanied by a chuck of the tail, just the
wooden toy with movable tail going click click as by clock-work,
I exclaimed with increased bitterness--A cheeky Weka Rail.

on the Spotted Ground-bird. 15 1
Alas for the fallibility of human judgment, for as the bird settled
down and began to peck about I saw that it was a Dove.
All this time my wooden friend had kept to the ground,
declining some quite low perches which I considered it ought to
have perched upon; roosting time came, however, and it
promptly Slew up to the highest perch, along \0x25A0which it ran with
the nimbleness of a squirrel, and I shouted with joy--A Touraco.
Instinctively I glanced downwards but, alas! instead of the
semi-zygodactyle foot I saw three long toes forward and one
backwards, with large blunt thick strongly curved claws; and it
had too a straight slim bill, absolutely diverse from the short
thick bill of the Touraco.
That night I had to retire and confess myself beaten, and
also during the following day. It certainly did occur to me that
"Ground-Thrush" might have been intended and I flew to
Geocichla --but Geocichla did not respond. However, on the
second day, while turning over the leaves of Wood's " Birds," I
came on a capital wood-cut of my friend. The value of illus-
trations in a work on Birds was fully demonstrated.
The species is called by Wood, The Spotted Ground
Thrush or Ground Dove, and the former of these names is, or
was, applied to it in the Natural History Museum. Thi&amp;apos;s bird is
not a Thrush, and is remarkably uu-Thrush-like. The generic
name "Ground-Thrush" has been very commonly accepted for
birds of the genus Geocichla*, and to apply it to Cinclosoma is
confusing and senseless ; names should be used which are appro-
priate and convey a definite meaning. In Campbell's Nests and
Eggs of Australian Birds the name of " Ground-bird " is used
for this genus, and should be adopted in this country.
Let me turn to the Rev. J. G. Wood's " Birds," p. 343, and
quote a few words :--
" Australia possesses a curious and valued specimen of this
group, which is popularly called the Spotted Ground Thrush, or
Ground Dove.
A coloured plate of a rare and handsome member of this genus is ready, and will
be published very shortly.--R. P.

" This bird is found throughout the greater part of Aus-
tralia and Van Diemen's Rand, and on account of the delicacy
of its flesh is greatly prized by both natives and colonists.
Being always attracted by certain localities, it may be easily
found by every one who is acquainted with its habits. Unlike
the generality of birds, it cares little for trees or bushes, and
seldom is known to perch upon the branches, preferring the
tops of low stone-covered hills, or rude and rocky gullies, having
a decided predilection for those which are clothed with grass
and scrubby brushwood. The spaces between fallen trees are
also a favourite haunt of this bird.
"The Spotted Ground Thrush is no great flyer, taking to
wing with much reluctance, and seldom voluntarily raising
itself in the air except to fly from one side of a gully to another.
When it does take to flight, especially if alarmed, it rises with a
loud fluttering noise, and proceeds through the air in an irregular
and dipping manner. To compensate, however, for its imperfect
power of wing, its legs are well developed, and render it an
exceedingly fast runner, so that it is able to conceal itself with
great rapidity as soon as it finds cause of alarm.The
flesh of the Ground Dove is remarkably good, and when the bird
is fat it meets with a ready sale, and is generally disposed of to
the game-dealers together with the painted quail, as it arrives
and leaves at the same time with that bird.
" The voice of the Ground Dove is not very sweet, its cry
or song consisting of a low piping whistle."
It will be observed that when Wood wrote, less than fifty
years ago I fancy, the Spotted Ground-bird was common and
well known--now it is rare. For over three years I have been
endeavouring to obtain another specimen--but in vain. Mr. P.
Peir of Sydney wrote to Mr. Carrick on the 9th June last as
follows " Two days after you left Melbonrue I dropped on to
something rare in the soft-bill line, viz. a Spotted Rock-Thrush
. At the present time he is in perfect health and condition,
having had nothing to eat but yolk of egg and mealworms, of
which he will consume at a frightful rate. I hope he will be
alive when you come back as I am sure you could win in the

rarest bird class at the Palace with him. The plumage is not
gaudy but very fine. He is as large as a Turtle-Dove.
When feeding, the tail is carried open like a fan and erected in
the same manner as that of a Peacock." From what I noticed of
the defenceless nature of the species, I feel that it is doomed to
extinction. The only hope of its being saved rests on the large
extent of country over which it is spread--" Tasmania and South
Australia, as well as the whole of the eastern portion of the
continent as far as the Wide-Bay district" (Mus. Cat.); " S. and
E. Australia, Tasmania." (Hand-list, IV.) ; " It inhabits the
forest country, heavy and open alike, from South Queensland to
South Australia and including Tasmania." (Campbell). Such a
wide range gives the bird a chance, at any rate for the present,
though its habits as described by Wood are against its pre-
servation. It will be observed that Mr. Peir also calls it a
" Rock-Thrush," a name not mentioned by Mr. Campbell, and
which should not be accepted any more than those of Ground
Thrush and Ground Dove.
Wood says--" The spaces between fallen trees are also a
favourite haunt of this bird." I think he is mistaken. The
bird is timid and watchful in the extreme, detects the approach
of man long before the man is in sight of the bird, and at
once dashes off to fallen tree, log, large stone or rock, or other
raised thing on the ground, behind which it stoops for the
purpose of concealment, becoming the wooden Noah's Ark bird
already mentioned. Being itself so low on the ground, it seems
to think that if it can only get behind something it will not be
seen. When running to shelter also it seeks to follow every
depression in the ground, and to take advantage of every slight
mound or rise in the ground behind which to steer its course.
Many a time, on peeping through a window into the garden
aviary, I have seen my bird feeding in the open, whither from
preference it would always resort; but no matter how cautiously
I might attempt to open the door, the bird would have
disappeaied, and would invariably be found behind something
lying casually on the ground. It would never go on to the top
of anything of the kind, nor rest on a stone as figured by Wood
or on a mound.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
Wood says--"It cares little for trees or bushes, and
seldom is known to perch upon the branches." Campbell tells
lls --&lt;&lt; i have seen it perched on thick limbs of trees about forty
feet from the ground." Gould, I am told, figures the female on
a low perch. The latter I feel must be an error. I never saw
my bird perch in any bush or on a low perch. During the day it
usually kept strictly^ to the ground; but when, ditring the day, it
did mount to a perch, it invariably went up to the highest perch
in the aviary, nearly nine feet above the ground, being very fond
of some long poles, along which it would run with considerable
fleetness, or walk as on the ground. After close watching, I
formed the opinion that it sought these high perches in order to
get more sun. If it chanced to be in a tree, it would instantly
crouch and become motionless on the approach of any one. It
is quite in keeping with what I saw of my bird that it should fly
on to " thick limbs of trees about forty feet from the ground."
I venture to lay stress on the word " thick."
My bird never roosted on the ground but invariably on a
high perch, whether in cage, birdroom, or garden. It went to
roost early, and seemed to select a thick limb just where it
branched from the trunk ; it slept in a crouching attitude,
usually with the tail level with or above the level of the bod}?-;
in a large tree, on a thick bough and close to or actually pressing
against the trunk, it would be practically invisible.
It seemed to be utterly defenceless, and never attempted
to defend itself from the other birds, of which it was much
afraid. Concealment seemed to be its one idea, deeply rooted
in every fibre of its nature, the posture being almost always that
which I have already described. It did not actually squat after
the manner of Snipe, Quail, &amp;c. ; these sit low with legs ready
to spring into the air and seek safety in flight. Such a position
would not suit the Ground-bird, who holds itself ready to display
a?id run. Stooping low, head and forepart low, the hind-end a
little up, it remains so still that often birds would go close up
without appearing to notice it. Ret me here quote from some
notes written while the bird was still alive:--" When the bird,
crouching in the thickest shelter or most shady shadowy spot
he has been able to run to on the appearance of an enemy

in the hopes that his general russet appearance above may save
him from detection, finds the foe right on him, for not until the
last moment will he move, then, and not till then, does his tail
suddenly ' go off.' With such startling quickness is the tail
raised perpendicularly, sprung into a full fan in the face of the
intruder, closed up and let off again, that it is really alarming to
any creature not expecting it; it is like the sudden explosion
of a bomb under one's feet. The white tips to the tail feathers
moreover give a curious flashing fireworks effect to the whole
performance in the shade of the forest; the body of the bird also
is to a certain extent invisible behind the fan--he endeavours to
hide himself as it were behind his own tail. The suddeuess of
the whole movement is invariably successful, the startled foe
bounding off in one direction as from a venemous snake giving
Cinclosoma an opportunity of scuttling off in another. As a rule,
if the ground be not too open, he runs off straight like a rat.
But I have seen him when taken off his guard, and attacked
unexpectedly and unprepared in the open, run off in a frantic
zigzag course, the speed being so great and the rapid and
frequent changes from the straight line being so abrupt that, not-
withstanding his short legs and closeness to the ground without
which such a rapid zigzag course would be impossible without an
upset, his body swayed sideways, right and left and left and
right, just like a racing omnibus, a sight often to be seen in
London in olden days."
The tail of my bird, which was a male, greatly fascinated
me. It consisted of twelve feathers, the four* central very
lightly, the remainder broadly, tipped with white. As a rule
the feathers were kept closed, so that the white tips were in-
visible and did not betray the bird, the upper surface of the two
central feathers, practically the only ones to be seen from above,
being brown, the remainder blackish. On certain occasions the
tail, fully expanded, would be raised until perpendicular like
that of the Peacock. It was not usual, as might be inferred from
Mr. Peir's letter, for the bird to expand it whilst feeding. In
my garden it never fed with expanded tail. It expands the tail

for the purpose of scaring its foes, as has already been described.
Doubtless it expands it also as a courting posture, and perhaps
as an ordinary display like a Peacock. When it spreads the tail
while feeding in the presence of a human being, it is from ner-
vousness, a kind of instinctive action to keep him off. I under-
stand that Mr. Peir's bird was kept in a cage so that it was
compelled to stand its ground. After a time my bird became
tame and friendly, and perhaps occasionalh&amp;apos;- expanded his tail as
a display to me--but this too was in a cage.
I have not done with the tail yet. The colour and pattern
of the under, of the display, side differ from the upper. Mr.
Gronvold has taken an infinity of trouble in his endeavours to
bring the expanded tail into his excellent illustration, and to
shew both the pattern on the under tail and the distinctive
markings of the female which are in the fore-parts of the bird.
But he has never seen the bird alive, much less the display; and
to sketch a posture accurately from a verbal description is
practically impossible. And even the pattern on the under side
of the tail can hardly be seen in a dried faded skin, as a skin is
stiff and hard, cannot readily be opened, and if opened does not
shew the feathers evenly as in the living specimen. I have never
seen a female and do not know that it does raise and expand the
tail--though probably it does when alarmed ; and the pattern on
the female seems to be less distinct than on the male. It must
not be supposed that because two females appear in the illus-
tration that the species is polygamous.
The following is the description of the under tail taken
from the living male:--The outer web of the outer feather on
each side is black, basal portion of inner bright slate, the black
from the outer web slanting across and occupying the apical
portion, but tipped with white. All the other feathers are bright
slate, with a subterminal band of black and tipped with white.
Taking the under surface of the expanded tail as a whole, the
bright slate forms a solid and slightly pointed arch. This is
surmounted by the arch of black with its shaft support (outer
web of each outer feather) on each side right down to the base,
the whole structure being crowned with white. I observe that I
have not made any special note of the part taken in the display

by the handsome under tail-coverts. Speaking from memory,
they droop over the vent and are not raised, but on this point I
may be wrong. Neither in the Museum Catalogue nor in any
work that I possess do I find any reference to the remarkable
coloration of the under side of the tail and the still more re-
markable uses to which it is put. Mr. Peir gave a description of
his bird, and referring to the tail says--" The tail is brown with
white tips and all white underneath." This is very strange ;
perhaps "slate" was written, and "white" is a transcribers
error. At any rate it shews that he observed the great difference
between the upper and under sides.
My Spotted Ground-bird was a very quiet amiable in-
offensive creature, but needed a good deal of attention; to some
extent a cross-tempered Spotted Bower-bird was the cause of
this ; it would have got ou much better in an aviary of smaller
birds. For some little time after being introduced into the
garden the posture assumed was head down tail up. As long as
it was in the garden it continued to rush for shelter on the
approach of any one, but gradually ceased to elevate the hinder
parts.
When strolling about it often looked Dove-like, and some-
times like a diminutive hen Pheasant; but there is nothing of
the Dove about it. Although keeping near shelter it liked to
*come into the open and bask in the sun or peck about. If on a
bright day it should go up to a high perch in the open, if
disturbed it would sometimes drop into the nearest thicket
almost as stone-like as the kittle Owl. It seemed to be able to
fly very much better than might be supposed from Wood's
account, being quite clever on the wing amongst the trees.
The wings are short and rounded.
I never heard my bird utter a sound in the garden. When
being fed in a large cage it would utter a very soft low whistle,
audible only to those quite near. Campbell says that it has a
peculiar whining or whistling note, presumably the same note
given in a louder tone.
The species is chiefly if not wholly insectivorous. I
occasionally saw my bird pick up seed, but a captive bird will

Mr. Reginald Phiixipps,
often pick up a stray seed instead of grit. The formation of
the bill is suggestive. It is straight and slim, the lower mandible
being springy. The two mandibles, until pressure is applied,
meet only at the tip so that, when an insect is seized, there is
great pressure at the end, not onty enabling the bird to cleverly
seize and firmly hold its prey, but also to subject it to such
pressure as quickly to kill it.
In captivity there is difficulty with the food, for my bird
did not take kindly to artificial mixtures of any kind. Tiny
cockroaches and mealworms it would take only too freely, but
having once taken a mealworm it would hardly touch am 7 thing
else, and it eventually died from the effects of a series of fits.
When I heard how Mr. Peir fed his Ground-bird I felt that it
could not live ; and writing later to Mr. Carrick he says:--
" Referring to your remarks about Mr. Phillipps' anxiety to
obtain a pair of the Spotted Ground-Thrush, kindly inform Mr.
Phillipps that I am sending him the specimen I possess, and
which I mentioned in a previous note " ; but in a further letter
he says :--" I came home to get the Spotted Ground-Thrush to
take down to the steamer on day of sailing and found it dead.
It was in perfeet condition, and Mr. G. examined it and like me
is mystified as to the cause of death ; its head was bent back on
to the tail as if it had had tetanus." The too free mealworm diet
unquestionably caused the poor bird's death. If I should ever
succeed in obtaining another, I would endeavour to dispense
with mealworms altogether, and feed it in the plainest manner.
Live ants, fresh ants' eggs, earwigs, spiders, woodlice, &amp;c., would
probably suit the bird well, but these are practically unobtainable
in London. It needs, also, more exercise than as a rule it is
possible to give it in captivity.
Although always roosting in a tree, a point not mentioned
by any writer, all the members of the genus seem invariably to
nest on the ground. Campbell says of the Spotted Ground-bird's
nest:--" Open or cup-shaped; somewhat loosely constructed of
strips of hard grey outer bark, dead leaves, and sometimes grass ;
lined inside with finer materials--bark, grass, &amp;c. ; placed on
the ground in a depression or hollow, sheltered by a stump,
fallen branch, stone or tussock, in forest country. Eggs .--

Clutch, two usually, three occasionally; oval or lengthened in
form; texture somewhat fine; surface glossy ; colour, dull-
white, spotted and blotched with olive or umber and light or
dull-grey, the markings being usually thickest at the larger end.
.The season commences with the early breeders in
August or September, finishing with the late ones in December
or January. Between these extreme dates probably two broods
are reared." Wood sa3^s--" The young are able to run almost
as soon as they leave the egg, and in two days their bodies are
covered with a soft black down like that of the young water-
hen." Can any one support this assertion from personal
knowledge of the genus? How remarkably different from the
Lyre-birds, of which the Ground-birds sometimes remind me !
Some of the colours of this species seem to fade after
the death of the bird, notably that which I have called "slate"
in my sketchy reference to the plumage, the Museum Catalogue
generally substituting the word " grey" or ignoring it altogether.
But it had a very real existence while my bird lived: and Mr.
Peir, when describing his own bird, used the word rather more
freely but occasionally preferring "lavender" and "lilac." I
must also draw attention to a large and very conspicuous patch of
bright blue-black (sometimes it looked pure but deep blue) on
the shoulder and adjacent feathers (wing-coverts), the former
set off with bold round white spots, the latter with less round
white tips. Mr. Peir says--"The whole of the wing-coverts are
a shiny black of very fine lustre spotted all over with pure white.
The sexes are different; and the adult female is thus des-
cribed in the Catalogue :--" Similar to the male in general appear-
ance, but easily distinguished by the orange-rufous patch on the
hinder cheeks extending some distance along the sides of the
neck, and by the ashy throat and dull whitish chin replacing the
glossy black throat of the male ; the grey chest-band is present,
but is somewhat paler." The length of the bird is about io
inches, and the colour of the iris "watery-black" or, as the
Catalogue has it, "very dark lead-colour."
My story is long and rambling, but the spotted Ground-
bird is an exceedingly interesting subject; and neither before
nor since have I possessed any bird at all resembling it.

THE AUSTRALIAN BRUSH-TURKEY.
Catheturus lathami.
By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
Surely amongst all the wonders of the ornithological
world there is nothing more strange than the family of the
Megapodiidae, in which we find the parental instinct, so con-
spicuously strong in the Avian Order generally, reduced to
vanishing point.
When we consider that the Megapodes and Brush-Turkeys
are content to leave their eggs to the sun-warmed sand, or to
the fermenting mass of vegetable debris, we are reminded of
their Reptilian ancestors of long past geological ages, and one
is almost tempted to suggest that these strange habits, depart-

ing widely from those of all other birds, have been transmitted
unaltered to these descendants inhabiting certain islands of the
Malay Archipelago, of the South Pacific, and parts of the
continent of Australia.
The Australian Brush-Turkey, Catheturus iathami, is the
best known of this family in European collections, as a living
bird. It seems to be hardy, and easily kept. A newly-imported
pair came into my possession in January, 1903, in good health
but of course travel-stained, and in broken feather. They
rapidly improved during the next three months, in an unwarmed
shed, supplied with a variety of seeds, grains and nuts, and well
bedded down with dry leaves and sand. On April 25th, I turned
them out into a large enclosure. In the afternoon of the follow-
ing day I found the male excavating a sort of trench on a bank
under some large Scotch firs, a yard long, a foot wide, and some
ten or twelve inches deep. I watched him for some time, and
thought that he was hunting for insects and worms; but, by the
next day, he had collected a heap, three or four large barrow loads,
of dead leaves, and debris, on the spot where the trench had been.
He was quite tame, and went on scraping at a few yards distance,
merely leaving off to chase away any other bird that came too
near, and returning to his task. This went on without inter-
mission for some three weeks, in all weathers. On a wet day
the poor bird presented a pitiably draggled appearance, as his
heavy tail got much in his way, as he kicked the soaked rubbish
up the slopes of the rapidly accumulating mound. The energy
displayed was remarkable, especially when taking into con-
sideration that the bird had been confined in a small shed, after
a long voyage; and for many months had had no opportunity
for exercise.
I soon had to enclose the mound and the two birds within
some wire-netting, for the male became very aggressive, fiercely
chasing off other birds, even male Capercailzies. Indeed I more
than once saved one of these from an ignominious defeat. The
Brush-Turkey used to chase a Capercailzie, and easily overtook it.
He then used to give a tremendous thump with his heavy foot,
making the feathers fly from the back of the fugitive; and
evidently this form of attack proved very demoralising to the

162 Mr. W. H. St. Quintin,
larger bird, who never turned, but fled at his best pace. The
female was always getting out of the enclosure, climbing up
the bushes, and dropping down on the outside of the fence.
The male was a rough wooer, and ran his mate about in a most
unkind fashion. I sometimes thought that he intended serious
mischief, but after hemming her into a corner, he would throw
himself down before her on his chest pushing out his head and
neck to exhibit his coloured wattle. Then the female, after
getting her wind, would suddenly race swiftly past him, and
gaining a yew tree, would jump from bough to bough till she
gained a perch some twenty feet up, where she remained safe,
while he went back to his labours.
When the mound had attained the height of about five
feet, with a diameter of twelve or fourteen, he seemed satisfied,
and was generally to be found mounting guard upon the top,
only striding down in rather a stately fashion to meet me, with
tail swinging and wattles displayed ; and returning to his post
after consuming the monkey-nuts, or hempseed, or other delicacy
that I generally brought with me. We supplied him with mown
grass from the lawns, and rough herbage, while he raked every
scrap of loose material together off a space some thirty yards in
diameter round the mound.
His challenge was strikingly like the distant bellow of a
bull ; and when he emitted the sound, the wattle on one side of
his neck was distended to the size of a small melon.
On May 17th, I found the Brush-Turkeys much excited,
the male was running up and down the wire-netting, with
wattle full}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; displayed, every now and then dashing off to the
top of the mound, then back to the hen (unfortunately at that
time outside the enclosure) trying to tempt her to it. A friend
and I tried to let her in, and of course the male being the bolder
of the two got out, and then followed a desperate chase! The
hen ran for her favourite tree, and for the first time I saw him
follow her off the ground, displaying his wattles. I could see
that the hen was not seriously alarmed, and here of course I
ought to have left them, but for the sake of other valuable birds
I was obliged to get him safely back into the enclosure ; and left

her outside, up the tree. We found 011 visiting the mound that
there was an open trench on the top, say two feet by one foot, by
one foot deep, evidently to admit the hen for laying, and the work
of the male alone which is interesting. The heat of the interior of
the mound at this time was very perceptible to the hand, though
I regret that I did not test it with the thermometer. (Von.
Rosenberg found that the thermometer marked 93 deg. Falir. in
the interior of the mound of another species of Brush-Turkey,
Talegallus fuscirostris, while the surrounding atmosphere was
only 85 in the shade. Workers of incubators will recollect
that the temperature required to hatch the egg of the domestic
fowl is 104 deg. Fahr.)
And now the female began to moult and the chance of
eggs for the season passed away. It seems highly 3 &quot; improbable
that in such a miserable summer any chicks could have survived,
even if the mound retained its heat sufficiently long for the
incubation period. At the Zoological Gardens last summer a
young bird, I learn from Mr. Thomson, did leave a mound, but
did not live long. But some forty years ago chicks were reared
in Regent's Park. They looked after themselves directly they
left the mound, the parents taking not the slightest notice of
them. They could fly at once, and went up to roost at night,
and grew so rapidly that in three months there was very little
difference between the old and young birds.
My birds are in fine order now, and the male already
seems inclined to go to work, but I hope that breeding operations
may be deferred till the end of April at earliest; so until that
time I shall supply no material.
I hear that our fellow member, Mr. Capern, has more
nearly approached success, for eggs were found in a heap raised
by his birds ; but probably the low temperature of the season
accounted for their failing to hatch.
With regard to the food for young birds, Gilbert found
that a newly hatched chick of Duperrey's Megapode fed at once
on bruised Indian corn. I should offer custard, ants' eggs,
soaked seeds and grain of various sorts, and raisins and any
available fruit, also small earthworms.

SHOW.
A few years ago the only cage-bird show held during the
year at the Crystal Palace was the " Great National," at the end
of January or beginning of February ; then the foreign bird
section, as a rule, was well worth going a long way to see, which
can hardly be said of the show held from January 29th to
February 2nd last ; but when it is remembered that two large
shows had been held in the same building within the preceding
three months it was hardly to be wondered at that one saw
practical!} 7, nothing that one had not seen at the Palace before.
The show, so far as foreign birds were concerned, was certainly
not up to the average, and not to be compared with the one held
in December last.
I11 the Parrakeet Class, Mr. Hawkins' Varied Lorikeets
{Ptilosclera versicolor) were again conspicuous, though one of
them appeared to the writer to be somewhat out of sorts. Of
course they took the first prize. Second came the only bird we
do not remember to have seen before on the show-bench, namely
a Red-bellied Conure (Pyrrhura vittata), well shown by Mr.
Osbaldeston. Like most of the Conures, this species is fond
of uttering a most ear - piercing and irritating shriek. There
were other good birds, such as Kings, Red-wings, Pennants,
and Swainson's Lorikeets, but nothing else of any rarity.
Amongst the large Parrots, Dr. Lister's now famous Banksian
Cockatoo was again the best bird. There were three Macaws
and several Amazons and Greys.
In the Class for rarer Waxbills, Mr. Hawkins' three rare
Firefinches, Lagonosticta niveiguttata , L. vinacea and L. rufopicta
were conspicuous. There was also a Bicheno-Zebra Finch
hybrid, and Mr. Osbaldeston's Crimson-finch (NeochtJiia phaeton)
was one of the finest of its kind we have seen. A Red-headed
Finch (Amadina erythroccphala ) was also worth notice. Mr.
Frostick sent a good pair of Trumpeter Bullfinches (.Erythrospiza
githagineal) and Mr. Hawkins a couple of Olive Finches (PhonP
para olivacea ).

MY AVIARY.
By C. Castle-Sloane, F.Z.S.
A short account of my new aviary may be of some interest
to our members ; it is 48ft. long and 32ft. wide. The houses are
built of brick ; and the roof is formed in two parts, the back part
being higher than the front, so as to allow sufficient light for the
cage birds which are kept on a shelf at the back. The roof is a
raftered one, match-boarded with felt and zinc above, which is
painted green ; it makes it warm in winter and not too hot in
summer. The flights are constructed of iron standards, the
wirework being light straight wired bird lattice (not the ordinary
wire netting), attached to iron standards, fixed in brickwork
which goes all round, making a shelter for the birds when they
are on the ground, the latter being paved with large flags, which
is quite as good as cement, if not superior ; as the latter, if not
properly laid, is apt to crack and break up ; and should you have
fountains (which I have) it is far better to pull up the flags to
see to the pipes, if necessary, than to break up and repair the
cement.
Planted in the flights are weeping willows, laurels, briars.

etc., and I have four fountains, one in each compartment, round
which I put stone-work, ferns, primroses, etc., and groundsel for
the birds.
To see the fountains in full play in the summer with the
birds flying through the spray and others bathing in the basins,
is a pretty sight. The rain-water from the roof is collected into
a tank which is placed inside the aviary, and this supplies the
fountains. Half of the top of the flight is covered with
duroline, the same material as was used on the roof of the Royal
Aquarium. Each flight is 15ft. by 12ft.
Dividing the flights from the houses is a wall about 4ft.
liigh with 6ft. of glass above it, making the total height 10ft.
There are two windows, which can be opened or closed as
desired, in each compartment. Strawson's patent glazing is
used, 110 putty being needed, and any of the panes can be
replaced in a very short time; in fact, if necessary, in the
summer time the whole of the glass can be removed, thus
leaving the aviary open in front. The doors are half glass and
half wood ; all the glass is protected by wire netting on one side.
Firs and other branches are hung up, the Doves and other birds
taking full advantage of them. The seed is supplied in tra3 r s
and Abrahams' seed hoppers.
Each house is 12ft. by 11ft., divided by wirework (light

bird lattice, straight wired), whilst at the back, the whole way
\0x25A0along, dividing the houses from the passage, the same wirework is
used, All the doors are opposite to one another, and no wooden
*or brick partitions are used. The birds can therefore see anyone
who enters the aviary, and are not frightened as they would be
af opaque partitions had been used.
A small greenhouse is first entered before the six feet
passage can be reached, this being divided from the aviary by a
door which prevents any stray bird escaping.
A 2ft. 6in. shelf runs along the length of the brick wall at
the back for the cage birds, and underneath this are kept the
various bins for storing the seed, etc. At the far end of the aviary
is the rain-water tank above referred to, which supplies the
fountains ; and from a tap one can obtain water for the other
birds. The tank is placed inside to keep the water from
freezing and to take the chill off. The aviary is heated by a stove,
the pipe of which runs straight up causing a splendid draught;
and the joints being air-tight, fumes are prevented from escaping,
and the aviary is kept in a nice temperature during the frost.
I have to thank Dr. Butler and Mr. Wiener for their
valuable suggestions as to the design of this aviary, which I
liave taken full advantage of.
Among my collection of Doves I have Red Mountain,
Wine, Rufous,White-fronted (which have bred), Smith's, Spotted,
Pigmy, Geoffroy's, Scaly, etc.
I am in hopes that my Weavers will turn out successful.
In another compartment I have a collection of British birds, and
*on the shelf I keep my special pets such as a Malabar Green
Fruit Sucker (which feeds from your hand), Yellow-winged
Sugar-bird, Scarlet Tanager, etc.
To make the aviary more attractive to bird and man it is
-surrounded with rose-beds and other bright flowers. The air is
very fragrant, owing to a belt of pine trees which in the
summer give a partial screen to the birds and in the winter
keep off the east wind. The aviary faces South.

The first series of Notes on Cage Birds (18S2) seems now to be a
decidedly scarce book, and we doubt whether many of onr members
possess copies ; it contains, however, some very interesting records of the
achievements of British aviculturists of some twenty-five years ago. The
various letters are mostly signed by initials or noms-de-plume, and no dates
are given. One writer tells of the arrival of a fine and healthy stock of
the Swift Lorikeet ( Lathamus discolor), several of which he himself kept
and found that they lived well on a diet of seed, boiled rice sweetened
with honey or sugar, and green food, though they appeared to do equally
well on seed alone. When shall we have an opportunity of studying this
beautiful species again ?
Another writer tells of the unsuccessful nesting of a pair of Carolina
Conures ( Conuropsis carolinensis), a species which, unfortunately, appears to
be fast approaching extinction. I11 going round his aviaries one morning
Captain Nicholl discovered an egg in a corner behind a dead stump of a
tree, which he describes as about the size and colour of a pigeon's. The
following morning there was a second, and on the next two mornings a
third and a fourth.
" During the time the eggs were being laid the cock Carolina did not
go near the nest, but, from the fifth day, he, together with the hen, sat
continuously. The two birds never left the nest, except to feed, for three
weeks, not even moving -when their food was brought to them in the
morning ; so I fully expected to see, some day, young birds instead of
eggs, but I was disappointed, and, 01: examining the eggs found they were
all addled."
Again referring to this interesting collection of letters on avicultural
matters, we find an account of the successful breeding in captivity of
Swainson's Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus novce-hollandicz), which makes the
second authentic instance we are aware of, of young of this species being
reared to maturity in this country ; the other being the now well-known case
at Blackpool.* The pair of " Blue Mountains" were kept in a small aviary
of which they were the only occupants, and their owner remarks:--"For
nesting, I had a box 14m. long, gin. high, ioin. wide, into which I fitted a
cork spout, the length of the box ; at one end a hole was cut, and all round
covered with cork. The first indication of nesting commenced in February,
and in about twenty-one days I heard the young were hatched. At the end

of five weeks they forsook the uest. In June the old birds laid again, but
whether the cock assisted the hen in incubation I cannot say for certain,
having but little opportunity of watching their doings, but I am tinder the
impression he did."
Little is known regarding the nesting habits of the Varied Lorikeet,
so that the following note which we extract from the January number of our
esteemed contemporary th &amp; Emu will be read with interest:--
" It may interest ornithologists to hear thatl saw two broods, three and
four respectively, that were taken from their nests--hollow spouts in trees, I
understand--about the 15th September ; they had been in hand a week
when I saw them, and the oldest lot would, I should think, just be able to
fly a short distance had they had their liberty. They appeared to differ but
little in their plumage from adult birds, excepting that the red crown was
entirely wanting ; three individuals, though, showed the first indications of
it by a narrow baud of red across the forehead. They were thriving on a
mixture of oatmeal and honey. These birds were obtained on Cambridge
Creek, some 30 miles north of Richmond township, Flinders River, North
Queensland.--Fred. L. Berney, Richmond (N. Q.)"
Another writer in the last-mentioned journal gives the following note
*on the Painted Finch {Emblema picta ) :--
"I caught a number of Painted Finches in the M'Donnell Ranges by
snaring them with a single horsehair, but for some unaccountable reason
they all died with the exception of one within 24 hours. I obtained all the
uative grass-seeds and had the ordinary shop-seeds as well, took every
possible care of the birds, but they died so rapidly that I gave them up in
despair. The single bird I brought down to Adelaide, and it is thriving in
the open-air aviary. There was a nest not ten yards from my fireplace when
I left the camp. The eggs are white, and the nest, the coarsest of any Finch
I know, one peculiarity of it being that a number of pellets of clay are used
in the foundation. I watched the nest built from the first stick. Small
sticks were used more than grass, and the nest is much smaller than
that of any of our ordinary Finches. Horace J. Page, Mitcham (S. A.),

The Philippine Hornbill was presented to the Zoological
Society by our member Mrs. Johnstone, and is the first example
of this rare species received by the Society. The Blue-rumped
Parrakeet has not been represented in the collection for some
thirty years. It is a somewhat uninteresting-looking bluish-
green bird, which feeds, Mr. Davison tells us, "on the small
gummy flowers of a plant that always springs up where forest
has been felled and burnt. It goes about in small flocks of
fifteen or more, and is not at all shy or wild."

DIAMOND FINCHES, YELLOW SPARROWS, ETC.
Sir,--C an yon tell me of any means of both preventing and curing
baldness in Diamond Sparrows ?
Another member has sent me a Diamond hen to see whether change
of place, food, etc., will help her. She is very bad, the feathers gone from
both head and neck, making her look exactly like a Vulture, and she has
been in this condition for some time. Would warmth or cold be best for
her ? She has been, and is, in an indoor aviary, but mine in which she now
is, is in a conservator}&amp;apos;, warmed at night.
One of my own Diamonds, who has reared nestlings this year, also
shows signs of the same trouble the last few weeks. They are not
together.
Can you tell me the difference, if any, in the appearance of cock
and hen Golden Sparrows?
I bought mine in the summer from a dealer who had several, some
with white, some with black beaks. He told me they came from California,,
and the colour of the bill was the distinguishing mark of sex.
I, of course, bought a '' pair," hoping they might nest, but now both
bills are black. I suppose the white bill must have been a young one. Is
there any difference, or are the sexes alike ? They are so shy that it is hard
to watch them at all, but one or perhaps both sing a loud sparrow-like
song or twitter.
I am hoping in the spring to have an outdoor aviary, a very simple
one, more for summer use than anything else, but with plenty of bushes.
Could I put Pileated Finches there ? And would it be any use having
Weavers among small birds such as Bichenos, Lavenders, etc. I have never
but once had a Weaver on account of their bad character, but if there was
any chance of their nesting out of doors I should like to try them. Are
they hardy enough to remain out in the winter?
My indoor space is limited to two aviaries, one holding Biclieuos,
Waxbills, etc., the other Gouldians, Longtails, Masked Finches, etc,
Though we have so little room we generally get some broods during the
year, but our luck was bad last year : only two Gouldians, two Diamonds, a
dead Biclieno nestling, and a nest of Longtails. The Cordons built a
pretty nest, laid one egg, and sat most carefully, but nothing came of it.

The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Howard Williams:

Finches " (Praclitfinken as the Germans call them). Either the bareness is
due to one bird plucking the other under the pretence of preening its
feathers, or some error in feeding has brought on a disease known amongst
bird-keepers as " surfeit."
The cure for the former is separation, and a change of partners after
the plumage has recovered; the treatment for the latter is--cage the
patient by itself; for one day only dissolve five grains of Epsom salts and
five grains of chlorate of potash in a wineglassful of warm water, and give
the mixture as the day's drink ; supply plenty of green food, but otherwise
feed as simply as possible.
Warmth is best for the recovery of feathers.
You could turn out Pileated Finches in the summer; but, whatever
you do, don't trust Weavers with any little finches which you value (I have
tried them with disastrous results); sooner or later the weaker birds will
be found with their heads completely skinned and their backs bare and
bleeding.
I only tried with Fire-Weavers, sometimes called " Bishops," but the
species of Hyphantornis or Ploceus would be worse if possible.
Both Golden and Yellow Sparrows differ considerably in the sexes,
the upper parts of the female being pale brown.
A. G. Butler.
A WHITE-TAILED WHYDAH.
Sir, --That intrepid Italian traveller, Major Casati,&amp;apos;during his sojourn
in Equatoria, met with a variety of the Whydalis, of which I am unable to
find an account in any of the ornithological works to which I have access.
He gives it the name of Mandolougo and states that in the Mambetta
country it is held sacred, and it is regarded as a crime to kill it.
It is caught by nets and two long zuhite feathers are plucked from the
tail after which the bird is allowed its freedom.
The feathers form part of the regalia of the king, and a severe
punishment is inflicted upon anyone who attempts to infringe the
prerogative.
Has this bird ever been imported to this country, and if so under
what name ?
Archibald Simpson.
Sir.--O 11 receipt of the above letter I wrote to Mr. Simpson to inform
him that I knew of no Whydah with white tail-feathers ; but that I would
communicate with Captain Shelley the author of the " Birds of Africa," who
would certainly know whether such a bird had been recently described.

There is no other Weaver-bird with white tail-feathers. The species
ranges over Eastern Equatorial Africa, between 6* S. lat. and il* N.
lat. or from the Usequa country to Shoa. No native name has yet been
recorded for the species. I should not be surprised if the chiefs use the
four buffy-wliite centre tail-feathers as ornaments, but this has not yet
been published."
To this I append the following remarks :--
I11 the Museum Catalogue the four central tail-feathers are
described as straw-coloured&amp;apos;, and, as you only mention two long white
feathers in the tail, I was unable to recognize the species ; but you will see
that, if the accouut is authentic, this must be the bird intended. It has
never been imported alive.

FOOD FOR NESTLINGS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997837" page_id="32958833"  page_num="Page 173" year="" vol="">
Sir,--F or some years I have been giving my birds, both foreigners
and Canaries, hard boiled eggs and breadcrumbs during the nesting season.
Year after year, the death rate among the nestlings has been very high in
spite of all my care. Believing that this was due to adulteration of the
bread, I have substituted this season Spratt's Dog Biscuit finely powdered,
and the result has been most satisfactory.
One of our members told me some time ago that he had reared a
nest of hybrids on this food, and as I had already proved its value for
newly-hatched Pheasants it seemed worth while to try it.
At first the birds did not like it at all, but finding no other soft food
in the aviary they took it as their young ones hatched, and fed the nestliugs
on it. They did not, however, seem to eat much of it themselves, and
perhaps this is one reason why I have had so few invalids this summer.
My four Canary hens have fully reared 32 strong young birds, a pair
of Ribbon Finches have reared nine young birds since September, and my
White Java Sparrows have three strong young ones nearl} 1, ready to leave the
nest. The Ribbon Finches lost only one young bird in the nest, and this
was the only one hatched in their second nest. Two fine young cocks died
about a fortnight after they left the nest, and No. 9 flew before her flights
were strong and was drowned in a heavy rain. The others are all hens but
one, and seem strong, healthy little birds. Two pairs of Zebra Finches in
the aviary have eaten the same food with apparent appreciation, but though
they seem to enjoy life very much are by no means keen on undertaking
the cares of a family. Rough nests have been built but no eggs laid. I

cannot, however, blame the food for this, as three pairs last year behaved
in a similar manner. My three young Javas are almost entirely grey,
though their parents are pure white. This seems a usual thing with these
birds. E. Brampton.

THE MANDARIN DUCK.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9991924" page_id="32958834"  page_num="Page 174" year="" vol="">
In reply to ait inquiry, the poliowing letter has been forwarded to Mrs.
Roberts, of Tasmania.
I am very glad to be able to help any one in raising Mandarins, but
am sorry to hear Mrs. Roberts has such trouble in getting a drake. Has
she tried the Melbourne Zoo ? or are there no steamers running from
Chinese ports to Tasmania ? They have these birds in Australia I know. If
she cannot get one there, it would not be difficult to send one out if some
one would care for it on the way, as the Mandarin is easy to get and bears
travelling well.
The ducklings are best left to be hatched and reared by the mother, if
a pond abounding in natural food and protected from vermin be available.
If not, the eggs can be given to a small motherly hen, and the young
reared in a pen or covered run. If in the former, the sides must be
smooth, as these ducklings can and will climb like rats. For food they
need hard-boiled egg and bread crumbled together, with duckweed and
small worms, or, in default of the two latter, chopped lettuce and minced
tender raw meat. Bread-and-milk should be avoided, as, though good for
other ducklings, milk is unsuitable for these. A sunny place is good for
them in Europe, but in Tasmania they would no doubt need to be guarded
against too much heat. They&amp;apos; are also liable to suffer if allowed to get wet
in captivity&amp;apos; during the first week or two, but here again a warm climate
would no doubt make a difference. If well cared for at first, tliey r are not
hard to rear in confinement, but of course they' would have a better
chance in freedom. I am sorry&amp;apos; I did not say anything about rearing
ducklings in my additional notes on Carolinas,* but the above may
perhaps be of use. They ought to take up both species for acclimatization
in Tasmania ; and, if they could get Mandarins direct from China, as I
believe they&amp;apos; do in Australia, these would be better stock to start with for
either turning out or breeding from than European specimens bred in
captivity. Frank Finn.

on the ground. After sitting for three days she deserted the nest, but they
have now made another one and have two eggs. The eggs are pure white,
about the size of those of Gouldians. The Pectoral Finches also have a
nest, the hen sits for hours and is then off for hours, so the egg--they broke
all but one--will come to nothing. Two of my hen Gouldians have died
within a week, they would go on laying. Do you think that Gouldians bred
in Europe would be more likely to breed in the summer ? The cock
Gouldians are in splendid condition, and so are the young birds bred last
autumn.
Portugal. R. S. Vivian.
The following reply has been sent to tl/rs. Vivian:
I doubt whether the fact of Gouldian Finches being born in Europe-
would prevent their trying to breed in the winter.
Australian Grass-finches seem to be ready to breed at all seasons,,
whether they have been newly imported or have been born here.
As Gouldian Finches seem to be exceptionally liable to egg-binding,
it would be better to keep them caged and without nesting material during
the winter.

Sir,--I was obliged, some months ago, to locate my pair of White-
eared Conures in a small garden aviary by themselves owing to their
pngnacious habits, and they have now started nesting ; the hen sitting
most attentively on four eggs in half a cocoauut husk placed in a small
box. The birds are being fed on canary seed, millet, hemp, and sunflower
seed, with a little ripe apple or other fruit daily, and I am anxious to know
if, in the event of young being hatched, you could suggest any addition to
this bill of fare.
Also would you kindly say if there is any instance on record of these
birds having been successfnllv bred in captivity.
D. Morse.
The following reply was sent to Mr. Morse:
It is a great pity the birds did not wait until warmer weather, as I am
afraid there will be little chance of rearing the young, if they should hatch,
unless it should be exceptionally mild. The only addition that I can
su gg es t to the food you are giving is soaked stale bread, which, most
Parrakeets take to readily and appreciate much when they have young to

Of course, groundsel and chickweed are excellent, if obtained fresh
in the spring and summer, but I should hesitate to give them at this time of
year even if obtainable.
White-eared Conures have frequently laid in captivity, and there is at
least one case on record of young being hatched, but not reared. I know of
no case of succeessful breeding, though as the species is not rare I think it
is very probable that young birds may have been reared, but there is
apparently no published record of such an event.
D. Seth-Smith.
CROSSBILLS.
The following reply was sent to a member&amp;apos;s query :
I don't see why Crossbills should not breed in an aviary with some
Scots fir boughs, or a young tree or two with bushy heads and well-
leaved boughs. They are very early breeders. There is no time to lose.
I certainly never heard of young being reared in captivity. I should
think the}'' will certainly be fed for the first fortnight at least on insect food.
I suppose the indispensable meal-worm would be required, if young were
hatched ? Also any small caterpillars that could be obtained. I wonder if
anybody in difficulties with newly-hatched insectivorous birds ever tried
small silk worms ?
My White-winged Crossbill was not destructive in the wood and wire
aviary in which he was over a year. But I recollect that the common
bird in a cage was very restless, and twisted the wires out of place. In an
aviary plenty of fir cover (Scots fir and larch) might keep them occupied.

HYBRID MUNIAS.
printer's error.
An unfortunate printer's error crept into the note under the above
heading in our last number. Dr. Butler is made to say " the indistinctness
of M. ferruginosa as a species is generally admitted," whereas what he
wrote was " the distinctness of M. ferruginosa as a species is generally
admitted."

Last year the Committee ventured to try the experiment
of issuing twelve coloured besides many other plates (which was
rendered possible by the great generosity of the Honorary
Business Secretary and Mrs. Phillipps), and a really beautiful
volume has been the result ; but the experiment was hardly
successful from a financial point of view. In the present
volume, therefore, it is proposed to give about eight coloured
plates besides perhaps a few uncoloured, so as to reduce the
expenditure to the amount of the Society's income. It must be
remembered that even eight coloured plates is a greater number
than has ever before been issued, with the exception of last year.
But although the Committee is resolved on economy, the needs
of future volumes will not be in any way neglected, and coloured
plates will be in readiness for the new year by the time the old
shall have expired.
We may take this opportunity to urge all members who
have not yet paid their subscriptions (which should have been
paid before the first of November last), to do so at once, so that
their names may not have to be struck off the list; and we would
also remind members how greatly they can help the Society and
improve the Magazine by introducing new members.
Referring to the Rules governing the Post Mortem Exami-
nations, it will be noticed that if a reply is required by post a
fee of 2/6 must be sent with the bird. We should like to
mention that Mr. Gill very generously hands this fee over to
the funds of the Society.

Each bird must be forwarded, as soou after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Indigo Bird (Miss St. Ouintin). [Your bird died of apoplexy. A11 exceptionally extensive
extravasation of blood on the brain].
Zebra Finch (Mr, H. B. Rathborne). [Your bird died of acute enteritis].
Tanager (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). [Your bird died of acute pneumonia, but the last attack
was evidently very acute as shown by refusing food and dying so quickly].
Red-legged Partridge (The Duchess of Bedford). [Apoplexy was cause of death. It is
by no means uncommon to see healthy birds attack one that is injured or in a fit].
-Californian Quail (Mrs. A. K. Connell). [Your bird died from heart failure. It was a
mere frame, the emaciation being extreme. There was extensive tubercular deposit
in the mesenteric glands].
Zebra Finch (Miss H. K. O. Walker). [Death was due to inflammation of the oviduct caused
by a ruptured soft egg, the outer covering&quot; of which being - retained set lip the inflam-
mation referred to. If this had been diagnosed and carefully removed with a small
pair of forceps she might have recovered].
Cordon Bleu and Zosterops (Miss E. E. West). [Your bird died of pneumonia and in
all probability your suggestion as to the cause is correct. Reply sent by post, fee 2/6,
received with thanks].
Waxwing (Mr. W. II. St. Quintin). " I have lost several during the last few weeks, some
three or four like this one newly-imported, but previously I lost two I had in my
possession over twelve months. Symptoms: drooping for two or three days and in
some cases scouring. Fed on ants' eggs, potato and a little preserved yolk of egg,
currants and sultana raisins. I generally give my Waxwings wild berries, elder, and
hips and haws, but there have been none this year. It points to some defect in feed-
ing or damp I think." [The post-moriem of your bird reveals no disease further than
general wasting and consequent anaemia. The pale coloring referred to is the result
of debility. Your opinion as to defect in feeding is doubtless correct. I have kept
many Waxwings, but with an opposite experience to yours. Mine were fat as butter
and all died in perfect plumage in a fit. I never lost one through wasting. I think
that owing to the want of natural food in the form of berries, etc., some more fatten-
ing food would have helped them. Doubtless, those lately imported were too far gone
before you received them. I certainly think the bad weather has had something to do
in keeping back birds already debilitated and prevented them from accommodating
themselves to an unnatural diet].
Masked Firefinch (Mr. N. B. Roberts). [Pneumonia].
Masked Finch (Mrs. Howard Williams). [Your bird died of a direct injury to the heart.
It had evidently swallowed a very small pin, which had penetrated the oesophagus
and the point was touching the heart, and there was a large blood clot in the thoracic
cavity].

" Many as are the volumes which have heeti written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson," Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist (as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins&amp;apos; pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the 'feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--

than add to their possessions a copy of 'The Birds of Tennyson.' by Watkiu Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number &quot;of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette,
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson&amp;apos;s
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also &quot;find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume --those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly lie observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song - birds. Excellent illustrations by

At page 147 of Vol. V. of the British Museum Catalogue
of Birds, Mr. Seebohm commences the Subfamily of the
Turdin^E with the genus Geocichla, and remarks:--" The genus
Geocichla comprises a well-defined group of forty f Thrushes,
which may be distinguished as Ground-Thrushes. They are
characterized by having the basal portion of the outside web of all
the secondaries and of many of the primaries white, occasionally
tinted with buff, but abruptly defined from the brown of the rest
of the quills. The axillaries are parti-coloured, the basal half
being white, and the terminal half black, slate-grey, or brown.
Most of the under wing-coverts are similarly parti-coloured, but
the relative position of the colours is reversed, the white portion
being on the terminal half. This genus is connected with the
genus Turdus through T. viscivorous # and T. viustelinus S.
" So far as I have been able to ascertain, the young in first
plumage of every species in this genus are spotted on the back
and breast; and I am not aware that the adult of any species has
ascutellated tarsus, though traces of it are to be found in young
* Geocichla cyanonotus was unfortunately printed on our plate before the alteration
in the Hand-list to cyanonota came under notice.

moult beyond the replacement of a few injured feathers."
And page 148 " No species of this genus is found in
Europe or in South America, except accidentally 011 migration.
On the other hand, it is the only genus of the family found in
Australia . . . ."
Professor Newton, in his Dictionary, at page 961 refers to
Geocichla as a phantom name, and at page 388 says :--" Ground-
Thrush, a name long ago used for birds of the genus Pitta and
its allies (Jerdon, B. Ind. /., p. 502) ; but latterly an attempt has
been made (Cat. B. Br. Mus. V. p. 147) to foist it on a composite
group of some 40 species of Thrushes which have been referred
to a ghost-like genus Geocichla , the characters and type of which
continue to defy discovery." Since Vol. V. of the Museum
Catalogue was published in 18S1, the genus Geocichla has been
revised, and many of the species then included in it have been
gathered into other genera. In Vol. IV. of the Hand-list
published last July, Geocichla contains but 28 species. Whether
applicable or not, the generic names " Geocichla" and " Ground-
Thrush " have come into such common use it will be convenient
that they be retained, and that the latter be used only for birds
of this group.
My own personal knowledge of the Ground-Thrushes is
limited, and to what extent they are ground birds I cannot speak
from personal observation. In the Catalogue Mr. Seebohm
tells us :--" All the Thrushes are principal^ ground-feeders,
especially in summer ; but the species of this genus are par
excellence Ground-Thrushes, being still less frequently found in
trees than their near allies. Their legs and feet are strong, and
pale in colour." Again, in the Emu (III., p. 82), Mi&amp;apos;. Frank M.
Littler, writing of the Tasmanian or Earge - billed Ground-
Thrush, Geocichla macrorhyncha (since removed from Geocichla to
a new genus Oreocichla), a species peculiar to Tasmania, says :--
" This Thrush seldom employs its wings, which are not really
strong, but trusts rather to its feet. The rapidity with which
it can get from place to place is really astonishing." But

07 i the While-throated Ground-Thrush. 181
these things cannot be said of the White-throated Ground-
Thrush without misrepresenting its nature. It is fond of the
giound I admit, but is fonder of bushes and the boughs of trees
at a moderate and medium height from the ground. Probably
it keeps about as much to the ground as our English Robin does,
though often mounting to higher boughs like our Song Thrush.
When Mr. Gronvold made his first sketch of one of my White-
throated Ground-Thrushes, he figured a bird on the ground. I
protested. He urged that a Ground-Thrush should be figured
on the ground to be in keeping with its name. I rejoined that
this particular species should be figured in a tree to be in
keeping with its habits ; so on a tree it appears. It is also fond
of sitting on stumps of trees, logs, rocks, and the like.
A tiue giound bird would be gifted with greater powers ot
tunning or fleetness of foot. This species 7ieither runs nor walks.
but progresses by means of hops. When on the ground, it
proceeds rapidly forward for a short distance and then pauses,
makes another quick advance and again stops, only when greatly
pushed proceeding forward to any considerable though limited
distance ; when pursued or greatly alarmed, it certainly can
scuttle along under the bushes with great rapidity, but not far
for very shortly, if need be, it takes to flight.
Probably I am quite correct in the conclusion I have come
to that, when undisturbed, the White-tliroated Ground-Thrush
piefers being off the ground except when feeding. It hops
sedately from bough to bough, very leisurely and at infrequent
intervals, but ceaselessly pouring out its gentle warble or louder
and defiant song. It seems to be a very local and stationary
species, and when undisturbed its movements are slow
measured, and dignified. But at the approach of man it
*drops to the ground, so as to hide its bright chestnut breast,
for the upper parts lend themselves well to concealment in the
solemn gloom of the forest. Each time it takes its short "run," it
lowers its head so that the whole bird is parallel with the ground,
but at each quick halt it stands erect, keenly alert and watchful;
nevertheless all the time it assuredly knows full well the value of
and puts trust in its protective colouring; and, as I have found
over and over again, it is remarkable how easy it is to overlook

it even in my little aviary ; it still further, and with much
success, seeks to avoid being detected by skilfully manceuvering
so as to place every available bush or tree between you and it.
Probably it is from its customary habit of seeking concealment
on the ground at the approach ot man that it has unfairly
earned the reputation of being a ground bird. Occasionally,
but I think rarely, it will hide itself away in the hollow of a
tree at a considerable height from the ground.
I have been asked--Is this species a true Thrush? The
question is not an unnatural one when one remembers that genera
so diverse as Myiophoticus and Ciiiclosoma are called Thrushes,
even at our Natural History Museum where the latter is or was,
to make confusion worse confounded, labelled "Ground-Thrush."
In our last number, at page 151,1 made some remarks on this
point. Names almost cease to be of value when used with
such want of care. What object is gained by such lack of
preciseness ! ! ! So far as the subject of this article is concerned,
it is a true Thrush. And I will discriminate and add that, in
some of its habits ways and temper, it is more of a Robin than
a Thrush. Although so truly Thrush-like, the bird of our
illustration may in many respects be regarded as a great over-
grown (and overfed) cock Robin.
It has been suggested, probably from a superficial
similarity in the colouring of the two males in summer plumage,
that this species 111a} 7 be akin to the Pied Rock-Thrush, Monti-
cola saxatilis. But this is not the case. In their habits and
general movements the two birds differ greatly. And especially
do they differ in the peculiarity that the Pied Rock-Thrush has a
very marked and conspicuous summer nuptial plumage which is
obtained by a direct spring moult of the small feathers, whilst
the White-throated Ground-Thrush follows the general rule of
the Turdidce and has but the usual autumnal moult.
As quoted above, Jerdou refers to the Pittas as Ground-
Thrushes; and he places the Pittas in somewhat close proximity
to the true Thrushes, I11 my birdroom it is a common thing to

sitting on the same perch and within a foot or so of one another.
In a dark corner, at a casual glance, they might even be mistaken
for one another. But the similarity, such as it is, will not bear
inspection. The birds of both species favour low perches and
shady nooks, and are consequently not infrequently brought
together; but they do not really associate--there is no true affinity
between them. I11 addition to structural differences, no better
proof that they are diverse need be advanced than the circum-
stance that they can sit and live together, and frequent the same
haunts week after week and month after month, and yet remain
in perfect peace from sheer indifference to one another's presence.
Two Pittas or two Thrushes, if well established and healthy,
would go for one another at sight.
It was on the 8th October, 1902, that I obtained my two
males, the only examples of the genus I have ever kept. I need
not describe the plumage of the male: Mr. Grouvold has
depicted the bird, including the face markings, with the greatest
care and accuracy, that is, as tlie}^ were nearly eighteen months
ago, in October, 1902, when he painted "Tim " the second bird,
the finest "Tom" being loose in the aviary, the general deport-
ment and carriage however being taken from the latter. Some
trifling changes in the shades of the colours have since taken
place; and last autumn, after they had fully completed their
moult, the brightness and brilliancy of the colouring, especially
of the garden bird, its glossiness and exceeding purity of tint
were beyond the power of human art and hand to reproduce.
The upper parts of the body were then a most brilliant shining
slate-blue, the under the most brilliant orange-chestnut, and all
so exceedingly clear and pure ; the forehead crown and nape
are of a darker shade, to aid the bird in escaping detection. At
that time, at any rate, the colours of the male as given in all the
books to which I have access were by comparison nowhere! But
such delicacy of tint does not last very long in a smoky Loudon
atmosphere. I have to speak of it as a dream of the past.
As might be supposed, Tim in the birdroom commenced
ana got through his moult fully a fortnight earlier than the one
in the garden, but the ultimate result was in favour of the latter.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps,
The female I have never seen. The Catalogue says
" The female appears to differ from the male in having the
upper back, scapulars, outer webs of secondaries, greater and
lesser wing-coverts, and innermost secondaries suffused with
olive-green." And Jerdon " The female differs from the male
only in the colours being less pure." The following extract
from Mr. Seebolim's "Thrushes" has been kindly forwarded to
me :--"The female is less bright in colour, the upper parts
having a greenish-brown shade, with yellow edges to the feathers,
while the wings are shaded with green."
Young in first plumage appear to be unknown.
Jerdon informs us :--"The White-winged (as he calls this
species) Ground-Thrush is peculiar to the jungles of Southern
India, extending as far as Goomsoor on the east coast, and to
Bombay on the west side of India. It is most abundant in the
forests of Malabar and Wynaad, but is not rare in the jungles ot
the Eastern Ghats. It prefers bamboo-jungles, feeds on the
ground, and generally perches low. Its food is chiefly insects,
such as ants, cockroaches, and beetles; but, not unfrequentl5 r ,
also stony fruit. It has rather a sweet song, not often heard,
however. Mr. Ward procured the nest in N. Canara, made of
roots and grass, placed at no great height from the ground ; and
the eggs, three in number, were pale bluish, speckled with
brown."
The following extract (as above) from Seebohm's
"Thrushes" is important:--"The White-throated Ground-
Thrush is very distinct from all its allies, and it is difficult to
say to which of them it is most nearly related. It has the head
and neck of G. peroni * joined to the body of G. citrina f, but
there can be little doubt that its affinities are much more w T ith
the latter than with the former species."

birds were very timid. They were not afraid of me but of one
another and of the other birds : of me and my bird-woman they
took no notice. When loosed into the birdroom and aviary I
would find them crouching, always on the ground, in all kinds of
holes and corners, trusting to their protective colouring for con-
cealment--crouching low, parallel with the ground, hiding the
more brilliant underparts. When on the wing, they would fly
rapidly for a short distance and then drop quickly and suddenly
into the covert. But this timidity passed away; and for a long
time they have been going their own ways, neither interfering
with other birds nor being interfered with by them--but there
are no other true Thrushes in the place.
In their general habits, they are very like our Song
Thrush with a touch of the Blackbird, but in many ways still
more like our Redbreast. Some of the ordinary call-notes have
distinct affinity with those of the Song Thrush. Although a
great deal on the ground and in low bushes, they are often on the
higher perches. They prefer to roost on thin natural twigs,
sometimes about 3ft.--4ft. from the ground, very often on the
highest available spot. Like Robins, each has his particular
sphere of influence. Tim reigns in the birdroom, rarely
venturing more than a yard or so into the garden. Tom reigns
in the garden, and woe did betide poor Tim if, tempted out on a
bright summer day, he ventured too far--Tom was after him in a
moment. During cold weather, when I endeavoured to drive
Tom into the birdroom for the night, he sometimes would not be
driven in, and I often had to net and carry him in. When
driven in, I used to find Tim just inside, with head down
bristling feathers and arched back, like the weaker dog trying to
intimidate the stronger, and Tom tight and with head high in
air and bill pointing to the ceiling, sometimes with quivering
wing, ready to give chase the moment Tim might take to
flight.
My reason for referring to this state of affairs in the past
tense is not because the two birds are dead or have ceased to be
in my possession ; it is because during the last two months or so
a slight change seems to have come over them. Tim, the house
bird, has been more assertive. If not too cold, he spends much

of his time on a perch about four feet from the biidrootu
window, while Tom sits on a perch nearly six feet from the
ground at the extreme end of the near aviary, a projecting
corner of the house preventing the two rivals from seeing one
another. Thus, hour after hour, and day after day, they sing at
one another. The singing is sweet ; but I doubt if the thoughts
they express would look very sweet if committed to paper. One
day in January, I was standing in the garden close to Tom,
watching his chestnut vest and white extended throat as he
sang, sang, and sang again. My presence ;possibly encouraged
him, or he wanted to show off, or perhaps to let me know how
brave he was, and I fear he must have hurled at Tim some very
naughty words, provoking him beyond endurance, for the latter
suddenly wheeled round the corner and dashing straight at Tom
knocked him headlong to the ground, hastily retiring with a very
respectable pinch of his breast feathers in his bill. Tom, with
the greatest composure, and without betraying the slightest sign
of anger or annoyance, philosophically picked himself up, slowly
and with a dignified air hopped step by step up to his accustomed
perch, and then uttered words which may be more readily
imagined than described. Towards the end of February I could
not help noticing that there were several white patches on Tom's
breast, where presumably Tim had been sampling the feathers. *
Nevertheless, being afraid of one another, there is no
actual fighting, but there is always danger in leaving such birds
together ; and often, when the weather looks particularly
threatening and tempestuous, I lay a sudden hand on Tim and
shut him up until the morning, an act which both birds seem
highly to appreciate. Those who can do so should keep such
birds apart, even separating the sexes during the non-nesting
period. I was told that last summer a male Orange-headed
Ground-Thrush at the Zoological Gardens, on being loosed into
the same aviary with a female, killed her before they could be
separated.
* The garden bird lias ceased to see the fun of this little game, and now spends
much of his time just outside the birdroom window, singing away and daring Tipi to
come out. The latter slinks about in the dimmest and most distant recesses of the
room, not venturing so much as to wag his tongue so long as Tom is on the watch.

The song of my two Ground-Thrushes is a very -reat
attraction. Although rarely singing at night like the charming

dawn until nearly dark forTully nine months out of the twelve.
Jerdon, quoted above, says that the song is not often heard.
Perhaps, in the lonely jungle, the song may be there but not the
human ear to listen to it. A great deal of the sweetest song is
utteied in a low tone as the bird is hidden away in some dark .
quiet corner, and cannot be heard at any distance. Many of the
notes, however, are loud and full, but these are the least musical
an are uttered from the higher perches, and are probably
notes of defiance. Although the less musical-probably owino-
to my birds being hand-reared specimens--their clear ringing
voices have been cheering our hearts all through this dull cheer*
less winter, are falling on my ears now as I write, and have this
winter compelled the most captious of my neighbours, however
unwillingly, to admire the glorious singing of the birds. Possibly
this constant singing may be due to the circumstance that there
are just the two males who pass the time in railing at one
another Repeatedly I have heard the one utter a series of notes
a kind of " O you great big doited old fool''-which has been
echoed back, note for note, by the other, with precisely the
same intonation, and this has been repeated some half-dozen
imes by each bird. During August they slow down ; and,
although they do not sing fully out again until December, before
the moult is over they commence recording and warbling in low
gentle tones. It is pleasing beyond expression in words, when
one is busy m the garden or attending to the food in the

absolutely fearless as regards your presence, pouring out his
little heart 111 sweetest melody.
I Wuot myself noticed any inclination on the part of
these Thrushes to mutate the notes of other birds ; my bird-
woman however, who is more with them than I am, declared
before Clmstmas that they had learnt several new songs. The
song is certainly very varied.
As a rule, when singing, they hold up their heads in an
ordmary posttton, delaying the white throat from which the

species takes its distinctive name. But on a few occasions this
winter I have found one or other in a totally diffeient posture,
perhaps a courting posture. On one of these occasions Toni
was within a foot of me, and I noted him carefully. He was
standing very tight and upright, the wing-butts hunched and a
little forward and clear of the body, the primaries pointing
straight downwards with the points touching the toes, and the
head drawn up but with the bill, close against the chest, pointing
like the wings straight down ; and in this quaint but very
strained position he was warbling forth the sweetest of sweet
notes.
Although not delicate for foreign birds, they do not like
severe weather. On the other hand, they are very fond of fresh
air and cold water.
The male White-throated Ground-Thrush is a tame hand-
some bird with a pleasing and almost ceaseless song, lives on
the simplest insectivorous food with an occasional visit to the
fruit saucer, and is absolutely happy aud contented in confine-
ment; and I have never regretted the day on which I added Tom
and Tim to my collection. It is from necessity, not from choice,
that they remain old bachelors--a lady White-throat has not
yet come my way.
THE GREAT BUSTARD.
By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I have more than once referred to my Bustards in the
Magazine, and I have always hoped that one day I might have
proclaimed that I had been successful in getting this fine bird to
rear young. But alas! I have within the last few weeks had the
great misfortune to lose by an accident my old male, which I
had kept here for nearly thirteen years; and as it will probably
be very long before I can replace him, I may as well tell how I
was very near succeeding some three years ago. As far as I can
learn, though Bustards have of course been often kept in
captivit}&amp;apos; in England, young have not been hatched from eggs
laid in confinement in this country. Early in the last century,

after the bird became scarce, but before it became quite extinct
as a British resident, it was not uncommon for eggs to be brought
in from the fields, and set under hens, and apparently sometimes
the young were successfully reared. I have somewhere, at this
moment mislaid, an extract from a book in the library of the
Linnsean Society, which states that two young Great Bustards
were reared in Bavaria, the produce of a pair of tame birds.
But one statement therein made seems to me difficult to under-
stand--that the parents were birds in their second year. My
experience is that the young male does not get his spring plumage,
pectoral bands, and whiskers, till his third summer; and till
that time does not expand his pouch.
However that may be, a young Bustard was hatched here
in the summer of 1901, as I will now describe. At the time I had
two females, one four years old, the other about six ; and two
males four and twelve years respectively. Both females laid
eggs, one 011 May 14th, the other five days later. One egg only
was laid in each case. The younger bird never attempted to
incubate ; the other commenced to sit at once, and was never
seen off, except when she came to feed.
Later on, I put the neglected egg into an incubator, but
it did not hatch. When I left for Norway on June nth the
older Bustard was sitting steadily. Neither of the males was
allowed near the nest. The sitting hen used to make gruff
" barks " at them, if they came too near, as she sat hidden in the
thick grass : sometimes rushing out aud hustling them off. We
noticed that though the two males were tolerably good friends,
the young bird did not venture to display this year, the old
fellow driving him off if he began to set up his feathers. I can
not do better than quote from a letter sent out to Norway by my
falconer, Arthur Moody, who was left in charge of the birds.
"June 16th, 1901: The sitting lien Great Bustard has
hatched off, but I am sorry to say that the young one is dead.
She was due to hatch to-day, but I thought I had better keep an
eye on her a day or two before, so on Thursday and Friday
(13th and 14th), I just went near enough to the nest to see her
sitting; and of course thought she was going on well, as I could

see no difference in her behaviour. However, I took the pre-
caution on Friday evening of putting a board near the nest with a
little meal, some ants' eggs, and mealworms upon it. I was going
to do the same on Saturday morning when the old bird came
rushing from a different place, and on going there I found the
young bird very weak, and almost unable to stand, with its eyes
shut, and looking very bad. By its emaciated appearance I
should say it had been hatched two or three days, and &quot;was
suffering from want of food. I put all kinds of things round it,
and climbed into the beech tree to see if the old one would feed
it. But she did not, though I watched her some time. She picked
a little of the flowering grass and dropped it near the young
bird, but it was too far gone to eat. I thought the best thing
was to cram it with chopped mealworms, which I did several
times, and to leave the old one to brood it until evening. But
it died about five p.m. I have put it into spirits."
When the young one was closely examined the skin of a
beetle larva (not a mealworm), that had been picked off the
ground, was sticking to its bill. It was unfortunate that at this
time there was a very unpleasant spell of weather, cold wind,
and showers of rain and hail. Possibly if it had been more
genial at this critical time, the little Bustard might have been
reared. In the autumn of this same year I lost this female from
a chill taken in a heavy storm of wind and wet snow in
November. This has up to now quite defeated my further
efforts to breed the Great Bustard. My remaining hen bird,
though nesting each year, has never hatched. And now for the
saddest part of my story ! My splendid old cock bird, which I had
kept here since the summer of 1891, a two-year-old bird then as
I thought when I received him, was startled a few weeks ago by
a gardener, whom he did not know, coming suddenly upon him.
The bird made a jump and fell on his side breaking his wing
close up to the body, and apparently a large artery was ruptured
by the splintered bone, for he was found a short time after-
wards smothered in blood. Though a grand bird to look at, and
in perfect condition, he only weighed twenty pounds. A fine old
wild male will weigh thirty pounds or even something more ;
but probably the young birds captured and reared by hand, do

FERTILITY.
By T. H. Newman, F.Z.S.
The subject of hybrid birds is one which has from very
early times received a good deal of attention from aviculturists ;
and till quite recently it was almost universally believed that
all hybrids, with the exception perhaps of certain crosses among
the gamebirds and ducks, were "mules," that is, were incapable
of reproduction. But it has now been proved that numerous
hybrids in many different orders are quite fertile. Very much,
however, yet remains to be found out, and a wide field lies open
to any one who will explore its unknown mysteries. In the
meantime, it may be considered of sufficient interest to place on
record a few results, obtained from certain Turtle dove hybrids,
from the beginning of 1901 to the present time.
The genus Turtur is a large one, containing some thirty
species, and has been divided by Count Salvadori, in his
Catalogue, into five subgenera, all of which, nevertheless, appear
to be very closely allied. The sub-divisions have been made
chiefly from the arrangement or form of the neck feathers ; this
being the special badge of the Turtle doves. I mention these
divisions, as four out of the five subgenera are included among
my hybrids.
In March, 190r, I procured a fine male of the, by no
means rare, cross between a male wild English Turtle dove*
(Turtur turtur) and a female domestic Barbary Turtle dove
(T. risorius ). A very brief description of this bird will suffice,
as this hybrid is well known. In shape and general appearance
it approached its wild parent: the scapulars showing decided

Mr. T. H. Newman,
traces of the cinnamon brown border with central portion
darker, the outer web of the outer tail feathers was conspicuously
white, the white tips of the outer tail feathers were also sharply
defined from the black portion, as in T. turtur. O11 each side of
the neck was a patch of black and white feathers, but not so
scale-like in appearance as in that species. Two more specimens
of the same cross, in nearly adult plumage, seem to differ in
several points from the original bird. They were thought by
their breeder to be hens, but I am not yet sure of the sex, as I
have only had them a short time. In size and shape they are
more like Barbary doves, and are larger than my former bird.
The scapulars, if anything, show stronger traces of the
cinnamon ; the neck patches are scale-like, and very similar to
those of the wild Turtle ; the white border is present at the
sides of the tail, but the white tips are not so sharply defined.
But to return to the first bird : he was mated in the beginning of
June, 1901, to a hen, which was supposed to be a hybrid between
a male Barbary and a female Necklaced Turtle dove ( T.
tigrinus) ; but as she in no respect, as far as I can see, differs
from an ordinary Barbary dove, I am compelled to say in her
ease--not proven.
The history of this bird seems to have been as follows:
A pair of Barbary doves were kept with two hen Necklaced
doves, no other doves being with them. The cock Barbary was
noticed to be on friendly terms with one of the Necklaced
hens, and accordingly the hen Barbary was removed. The
Barbary cock and hen Necklaced nested, with the result that
this bird, the very naturally supposed hybrid, was reared. The
hen Barbary was not again introduced till a day or two before the
young bird was hatched. The hen Necklaced dove afterwards
came into my possession. Four days after, she mated with
another Barbary cock which I had only bought the day before.
This, I think, showed that she had been used to the company of
a Barbary dove. She laid one egg which was unfortunately
unfertile ; then several imperfect eggs followed, and she died
when I had only had her two months. Thus I was unable to
clear up the mystery which hung round her supposed daughter.
Certainly all the eggs which this supposed hybrid lays are

smaller than the majority of Barbary eggs; in fact they are not
much larger than the egg laid by the Necklace hen. But one
can hardly establish a relationship on this ground, and in hybrid
breeding one must be absolutely sure of one's facts.
The result of the Union, between the first-mentioned
bird (the Turtle x Barbary hybrid) and the supposed hybrid, was
five young from three nests, all of which were reared, though
three of them did not reach maturity. These young all
approached the Barbary dove in colour, though some were of a
darker shade than others. The two that lived are a cock and lieu ;
the cock in shape favours the Barbary. At a little distance
he appears of the usual plain fawn colour, but, when closely
examined, the feathers of the scapular and interscapular region
are found to be bordered at their tips with a lighter shade of
fawn, the centre portion being of a slightly greyer shade.
Thus the strong developed " lacing " of the wild Turtle dove
has been transmitted to the #-bred offspring. But the most
noticeable feature lies in the black ring on the neck, which,
instead of being a plain broad black collar, has more the
appearance of an irregular black patch on each side of the neck,
almost separated at the back where the black feathers are tipped
with pale buff. His notes hardly differ from those of the pure
Barb ary.
In 1902 this bird paired with his mother. The first two
nests did not produce any result, probably owing to the male
bird not being fully developed, as he was rather delicate when
young. However in the third nest two young were hatched
and reared, which were practically pure Barbary doves in
appearance. I believe they were both hens.
The hen ( |Turtle x # Barbary) differs from her brother
in several points. She is a good deal smaller, and I think
distinctly resembles the wild Turtle dove in shape, but is more
Barbary like in colour. The scapulars and smaller wing-coverts
are more uniform, but are narrowly tipped with buff, which gives
the bird a slightly "mealy" look; the black collar is more
regular, but, even in her, some of the feathers at the back are
narrowly edged with buffish white. Her notes approach those of

Mr. T. H. Newman,
the domestic bird, but slie speaks the Barbary tongue, if I may
so express it, with a slightly foreign accent: for example, the
laughing note, instead of being a clear ringing He-he-he-he-he,
is usually run together like He-e-e-e-e. She has never been
mated.
In 1902, the Turtle x Barbary hybrid cock paired with a
white Barbary hen. One young one was hatched, almost on the
same day unfortunately the hybrid parent escaped, which follow-
ing the final example of its prototype of the Ark, " returned not
again any more." The hen notwithstanding managed to rear
the young one, but it was weakly and did not live for more than
six weeks ; for which I was sorry ; because this bird, in spite of
being bred from a white hen and only being # T. turtur to f of
T. risorius, was very dark in colour, being very little, if any,
lighter than its father, and very much darker than any of the five
young which were bred from the same hybrid parent when
mated to a normal coloured Barbary hen the summer before ;
which fact is not a little curious. Can it be that the absence of
pigment in the white female parent gave a better opportunity
for that of the male to be transmitted ?
Another hybrid with which I have been very successful is
that between the Necklaced dove ( 7 &quot;. tigrinus ) and the Barbary.
It is hardly to be wondered at that this cross should be a hand-
some one, considering what a beautiful species T. tigrinus is.
But this species seems to be subject to a good deal of individual
variation, both in size and in the intensity of its markings. The
largest birds are said to come from Java, Timor, etc. As far as
my limited experience goes, the larger specimens seem less
distinctly marked on the wings than the smaller. The bird
at present exhibited at the Natural History Museum, from
Tenasserim, is very large, larger than any I have ever seen alive,
with the dark shaft stripes on the upper parts poorly developed,
but it does not appear to be immature as it has a large neck
patch forming quite a cape round the nape and sides of the neck.
In its large size and comparatively plain wing-coverts, this
specimen would seem to approach T. chinensis, a species however
with which I am not acquainted. An imported hen, that came
into my possession, though large, was decidedly smaller than the

Museum bird and bad the wing-coverts more plainly striped.
And lastly a pair I had, which were bred in England, were again
smaller, but brighter in their colours with the shaft stripes on the
wings broader and more distinct (though these are features
which I believe increase with age), the tail also seems longer in
proportion, and the whole bird is more graceful. It is from the
cock of this last pair that my hybrids were bred.
The first two, hatched in 1902, were produced under
rather curious circumstances. I have mentioned above that
during this year I had a Barbary hen mated to her hybrid
(I Turtle x f- Barbary) son. He was not a very demonstrative
mate ; and, after they had reared their first two young ones, I was
surprised to find that the next nest they had contained two very
dark young ones, which I at first could not make out. In the
same compartment was a cock Necklaced dove, which had
lately lost his mate, and which I had frequently noticed was on
friendly relations with the Barbary hen. It soon turned out that
these two young were undoubtedly Necklaced x Barbary
hybrids. The necklaced cock was mated to this Barbary
throughout last season ; with the result that seven more young
ones have been reared from them, all resembling these first two.
The Necklaced x Barbary hybrid is a decidedly attractive
bird, taking chiefly after the male parent, and may be briefly
described as follows :--Mantle with the scapular region a rich
brown, the latter with narrow dark grey median stripes expand-
ing slightly towards the tips of the feathers ; the outermost wing-
coverts ashy grey, almost concealed when the wing is closed ;
quills very dark brown approaching black, and longer in pro-
portion than in the pure Necklaced Dove; tail, long, the three
outer feathers 011 each side graduated and tipped with greyish
white; head, with the throat and breast grey with a strong vinous
tinge; on each side of the neck, narrowly joined at the back, a
large patch of black feathers edged with white somewhat after
the manner of the English Turtle dove. These feathers can
hardly be said to be bifurcated, as in T. tigrinus, but most ot
them seem to have a break in the centre ; in fact they may be
said to be intermediate between the corresponding feathers of
the two parent species. Another point in which it rather

resembles the Common Turtle is the voice. The note used, when
calling its mate to the nest, reminding one of T. turtur only
harsher ; at other times, when sitting quietly on a perch, the coo
is very like that of the Necklaced dove. It sometimes uses also
a short grating note which corresponds to the laughing note of
the Barbary.
In June 1903, a cock Necklaced x Barbary hybrid, hatched
in the beginning of the previous September, mated with a white
Barbary hen. The first nest contained unfertile eggs, but these
were laid in less than a week after pairing. Four more nests
produced six young, all of which have been reared and seem
strong. This speaks well for the care bestowed on them by their
mother; for the cock, after assisting very fairly with the first
pair of young, has since taken very little share in either sitting
or feeding; in fact, when the hen was thus engaged, he did his
best to persuade her to desert and lay again. I never saw him
on the eggs once, nor take any notice of the young during the
rearing of the second pair.
These six (J Necklaced x  |Barbarj'') doves show a good
deal of variation in colour. One, a hen, is very nearly as light
as a pure-bred Barbary, but the black collar is not so sharply
defined and is very narrow at the back : also, when examined
closely, the scapular feathers are seen to have a faint stripe down
their centres. The other five are considerably darker, some being
nearly as dark as the J-bred birds between T. tigrinus and T.
risorius. Their notes, however, are more Barbary like : but they
certainly favour the Necklaced dove more than the % Turtle x
# Barbary does the Common Turtle. I have but little doubt
that these will breed, if suitably mated this coming season.
The prettiest Turtle dove hybrid however, that I have
seen, I think, is that between the Necklaced dove (T. tigrinus )
and the Senegal Turtle dove T. senegalensis&amp;apos;), of which I was
fortunate enough to become possessed of a fine pair during the
autumn of 1902. I11 some respects this hybrid seems to combine
the best points of both parents, though I do not think that on
the whole it equals the pure bred T. tigrinus , which has so many
charms of its own, that it can scarcely be improved. The chief

beauty of the hybrid lies in the extraordinary size of the neck
patches, the backwardly-placed collar of the Necklaced dove
having to a certain extent combined with the forwardly-placed
neck patches of the Senegal dove, so as to form a beautiful wide
collar, extending fully f- of the way round the neck, only being
broken in front by the rich vinous of the throat and breast.
This collar is composed of strongly bifid feathers ; which is only
to be expected', as this feature is possessed by both parents.
These feathers are black with rusty vinous tips. The head is
grey with a strong vinous wash ; the scapulars and smaller wing-
coverts show distinct rusty edgings, the stripes of tigrinus have
nearly disappeared, only being represented by the darker colour
of the actual shafts of some of the feathers, being most pro-
nounced in the tertials. The whole wing when spread out is very
pretty ; the warm rusty-tinted portion nearest the body being
separated from the almost black primaries by the grey outer
wing-coverts which are delicately edged with ash colour, forming
a grey patch in the centre of the extended wing. Their notes
very much resemble those of the Necklaced x Barbary hybrid.
I allowed the Necklaced x Senegal hybrids to mate
together in June, 1903, as I believe that young, bred from hybrid
parents, both of the same cross, are wanted, as shedding light on
the subject of the origin of species. But though seven or eight
eggs were laid, most of them were soon broken, and the birds
did not seem inclined to sit on those that were left. Two eggs,
which I managed to get incubated by other pairs were not fertile;
but this certainly does not prove that this pair could not have
bred.
In the above account I wish to emphasize that not only
did three distinct hybrids breed, but that they were all extremely
fertile, as the following table shows :--

* In this case the immaturity of the male, as has already been shown, was the
probable cause of no young being produced in first two nests.

It will be noticed that all the hybrids that bred were males,
though the only female tried (the Necklaced x Senegal) laid
freely : also I believe the female Turtle x Barbary has produced
eggs.
With regard to the utility of Columbian hybrids, it would
seem doubtful whether the hybrids, recently bred by Mr.
P. St. M. Pod more,* originally between a cock domestic Pigeon
and a hen Wood-pigeon ( Columba palmnbus), and subsequently
from a hybrid cock (Domestic Pigeon x Wood-pigeon) mated to
a domestic hen Pigeon will eventually prove of more practical
value than the above Turtle dove hybrids. It is interesting to
note that almost precisely similar results should have been
obtained in two distinct families of the same order almost at the
same time. -

bears out Mr. Dutton's in regard to the hardiness of this lovely
bird.
I had a pair, King and Queen, for nearly three years in an
outdoor aviary, which was occupied by various species of the
beautiful Broad-tail family. On frosty mornings when I had

broken the ice in their drinking fountain, which was a zinc dish
18 inches square, let into the ground, level with the surrounding
grass, the King and Queen used to be first down to the water, as
they were easily masters of all the other inmates of the aviary,
and, plunging into the dish, would send the water flying in all
directions, and afterwards would hang out to dry on a branch
in the most open part of the aviary, frequently in the teeth of
a keen North-Easter. *
During the time I had them the}&amp;apos;- were never ill a day, and
they have left a lasting impression in my mind of their beauty
and intelligence which makes me long for the time when I can
find suitable accommodation for another pair.
As Canon Dutton says, the endurance of cold by Parrots
is an interesting subject, and I am inclined to think that he is
right when he remarks that it seems to be settled more by species
than by habitat. For instance, I have kept nearly all the Broad-
tails and they have all been entirely regardless of cold. One
pair of Pennants I had, purchased as very young birds in a
terrible dirty and featherless condition, I turned out in June, and
they came into brilliant plumage the following autumn, and as
winter approached I was anxious to get them out of a habit they
had formed of sleeping in a Thorn tree in the open aviary, and
induce them to follow their companions into the inner aviary at
night. But although every night for weeks, as dusk approached,
I drove them in, immediately my back was turned they were out
and on their old perch again, and nothing short of closing the
door, which for many reasons I was reluctant to do, would per-
suade them to stay in ; and all through that winter and three
following ones I frequently found them in a morning with their
backs flecked with snow or sleet that had fallen during the
night. I had that pair for four years and they were always the
picture of health.
Red Rosellas, Mealy Rosellas, Crimson Wings, and Bar-
nards I have found equally hardy; all took their bath summer
and winter alike with no sign of either distress or even dis-
comfort, however severe the weather was. The winter of '95
and '96 was as bad as any we have had for many years, and this
is included in the period of which I am writing.

On Parrakects.
Conures I have also found indifferent to cold, although not
so fond of bathing as the Platycerci ; and a pair of Blue Bonnets
proved as hardy as an} r of them.
But Turquoisines and Elegants, although I believe coming
from the more northerly portions of the Australian Continent,
cannot endure exposure to severe weather, and ought to
be taken indoors as winter approaches. I once lost three
Turquoisines in one night through sudden cold. I remember
we had a very warm late summer and I had been lulling
myself into the belief that the weather would continue warm
and open and that winter was far off, when suddenly, one night
late in October, there came an alarming drop of many degrees
in the temperature, and when I went down to my aviary in the
morning, after having spent a wretched night fearing the worst,
I missed the shrill whistle with which one of the cocks always
greeted my appearance, and not being able to see more than three
Turquoisines I searched among the bushes and found two cocks
and a hen lying on the ground, killed by the cold. I immediately
caught up the others and the Elegants, and never after did I
leave them out of doors later than September.
How is it that there are no Turquoisines or Elegants
to be obtained now? They are among the most desirable of
all Parrakeets from an avicultural point of view, and if taken
indoors in September, even if placed in a room, the temperature
of which is kept just above freezing point, and turned out
again late in May, they will give no trouble whatever, and if an
aviary is devoted entirely to the species they will breed as easily
as either Cockatiels or Rosellas. They are very impatient of
the presence of other birds in their vicinity, and unless the
aviary is very large, no young need be looked for unless an
aviary is entirely devoted to them.
I was never successful in getting my Blue Bonnets to
nest, and should like to know whether they have ever bred in
this country. They are charming little birds, and seem to be
as scarce as either Turquoisines or Elegants now.
The Blue Mountain Tories have also proved quite hardy
Probably for that very reason, the northerly portion being the hottest.--A. G. B.

with me, although I must admit I have not had a pair longer
than two 3'ears, when one of them died in a fit one very hot day
in July. I found a clot of blood on the brain and the body
simply a ball of fat.
These birds while I had them were fed on the ordinary
seed diet with two or three times a week a tablespoonful of
honey and some sponge cake.
They were the tamest Parrakeets I ever had, and would
fly on to my shoulder or hand immediately I entered the aviary.
The cock would roll over on his back in my hand and play
with the fingers of the other hand in the same manner that a
puppy will do, pretending to bite and pushing my fingers with
his feet. They were both as playful as kittens.
I have thought since, after reading the experiences of
some of our members with these birds, that had I given them
less seed and a more suitable diet, considering that they are
brush-tongued and pollen eaters, I should never have lost the
cock, and thus, through being at that time unable to get
another, I was persuaded to part with the hen to a friend who
had a bird he wished a mate for. She died a year after.

Those of our members who have not been to the Gardens
for some time will be surprised and gratified, on their next visit,
to find how many and great are the improvements that have
been carried out. Since the appointment of the present
Secretary, less than a year ago, numbers of lasting improve-
ments have been made in almost every direction.
We can only, in this journal, enumerate a few of the
alterations in the various aviaries, etc.
The Western aviary, which was in a very dilapidated
state, has been practically rebuilt, and is now completely
furnished and beautifully fitted up and stocked. The larger and
less attractive Doves and Pigeons have mostly been moved to the
new Plieasantry near the South Entrance. Here the experiment

is being tried of keeping a pair or so of Doves with each pair of
Pheasants. This fine range of Pheasantries is entirely new,
although it is on the site of the old one, and is very well
gquippgd. for its purpose. Many of our readers have looked
with disgust on the wretched way in which the smaller Finches
treated in the past, a number of exceedingly small box-
cages in the Parrot House being the only accommodation
provided for them. This has all been altered now, and all these
little birds have been transferred to the aviaries at the back of
the Insect House, where some of them have actually commenced
to build nests. Other improvements have been made in the
arrangements of the birds in the Parrot House. The Toucans
have been transferred to the Western Aviary, and their large
cages are now occupied by the smaller Parrakeets and Lorikeets.
The large new aviary on the north bank of the Canal is tenanted
by a number of Crows, Gulls, Herons, etc., and it is intended
later to transfer some of the hardier Parrots thither also.
Mr. Bertling, who has for some years been engaged in the
Superintendent's office in the Gardens, has been appointed Head
Keeper, and the Secretary informs us that he has given him
special charge of the Birds. This is an exceedingly satisfactory
arrangement, as Mr. Bertling is an enthusiastic and experienced
aviculturist, and a member of the Avicultural Society.

for the month of February 1904:

ASPECT FOR AN OUTDOOR AVIARY.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99884625" page_id="32958879"  page_num="Page 203" year="" vol="">
Sis,--As we all know, it is one of the first maxims of outdoor avicul-
ture that it is useless expecting success unless the aspect of the aviary is
South or South S.E., but what can be said of a Corporate body who, after
seeking advice North, South, East and West, spends a considerable sum of
money on an otherwise fairly well-planned and praiseworthy erection and
places it in a position facing almost due North. I am referring to the
Corporation of this town, Southport.
When I first heard of the intention of the Corporation to erect an
aviary, I was pleased beyond measure, and applauded the leading spirits on
the Parks Committee who had originated the idea, and was about to offer
my services to them in either an advisory or any other capacity, having had
many years' experience in this locality with over fifty kinds of British and

oreign birds in outdoor aviaries, many of which, as our members know, I
have succeeded in breeding here. But learning that it was the intention of
the sub-committee, to whom the matter was delegated, to visit several
towns where there were Corporation aviaries, seeking information on the
subject, I felt that there was no need for any advice or help I might render,
and therefore did not proffer it.
From time to time there were announcements in the local press of the
progress matters were making, and being busy at the time, it was some weeks
after the opening ceremony before I was able to visit Hesketh Park.
Imagine my surprise when I did so, on discovering that the site
chosen was one facing almost due North, in fact, if the committee and
their advisers had diligently sought for a position where they could erect a
house and enclosure suitable for a Polar Bear that some townsman had
presented to the Corporation, instead of a house for some of the most sun-
loving creatures in creation, they could not have hit upon a more suitable
place for the purpose in the whole thirty acres of the Park.
The matter has been the subject of much adverse comment, and very,
I may say, vigorous censure, by bird lovers of the town in the correspondence
columns of the local press, and which unfortunately I have been much too
busy to take any part in ; and owing to the energetic action of the Honorary
local Secretary of the Society for the Protection of Birds, Mr. Walker,
many of the more delicate foreigners, I believe in deference to public
opinion thus aroused, were caught up, placed in cages and taken into oiie
of the greenhouses last winter.
What has been done this Winter I do not know, and have only had
time to go out there once in November to look at the birds, but from
several statements in the papers I gather that they have had few, if any,
deaths, and that many of the birds during the past summer have reared
young. But I have no official information, and am therefore pleased to
notice that the Corporation have become members of our Society ; and
through their Curator, Mr. Hathaway, I hope we shall be furnished with
some details in regard to the inmates of this unique aviary, and particulars
of its death rate, which will doubtless be of great interest to all of us.
If it is true that very few deaths have occurred and that many of the
birds have bred during the past summer, it is only another confirmation of
my oft-repeated remark in my contributions to this Magazine, that we none
of us yet know what foreign birds really can endure in the way of climatic
vicissitudes and ill usage resulting from ignorance. In justice to the
Corporation I must admit that when I saw the birds last, in November,
none of them, so far as a casual examination showed, seemed actually ill or
in extremis, but many of them were very fluffy, and sat moping on their
perches in a far from happj&amp;apos; condition.

Nottingham, is the Honorary Curator of the Nottingham Public Aviary,
which, I believe, is one of the best planned and most successful in the
country, and although I have never seen it, I am prepared to aver that it
does not face North or anywhere near that aspect, and I venture to predict
that if any member of Mr. Rotliera's committee suggested erecting another
aviary with such an aspect, however desirable in every other respect it
might be, he would wash his hands of the whole affair, as I would myself.
It is difficult to conceive how a body of men and their advisers could
be so misguided in a matter of this kind when a moment's thought would
have convinced them that a site that was not even advisable for a green-
house, could not possibly be suitable to confine, all the year round, such
sun-loving creatures as God's most lovely creation, the birds.
My object in bringing this matter to the notice of this Society (a
.Society of which I am proud to think I was one of the pioneers and founders,
and on whose Committee and Executive I have served ever since its founda-
tion) is the hope that what public opinion here has failed to effect, viz., a
removal of the aviary to a more congenial spot, may be effected by the
expert opinion of many of our members, who, I hope will take the
matter up and express themselves freely in our subsequent issues on the
subject. John Sergeant.
PASSERINE PARRAKEETS: CORDON BLEUS.
Sir, --I have a pair of Blue-winged Parrakeets in niv mixed outdoor
aviary, and the\'have stood the winter well. I should be obliged if any of
the members would say if these birds are difficult to breed, and what do
they like to nest in. They only have cigar boxes in the aviary. A pair of
Cordon Bleus have been in good health and feather all this winter outside,
but they and the other birds are driven into the inner shed at night and the
door shut.
M. C. Hawke.
[A small log nest or large cocoa-nut husk would suit them as well as
anything for a nest. If a box is used the bottom must be slightly hollowed
to prevent the eggs rolling about and getting cold. When young are
hatched some soaked stale bread, squeezed nearly dry, should be given in
addition to as great a variety of seeds as possible, and a liberal supply of
green food. Mr. O. E. Cresswell bred this species in a small cage in 1S92,

bright red ; feet dark grey. It is rather larger and thicker set than the
Perfect Lorikeet with which it has mated. It appears to be very hardy, and

from Macassar, Celebes Islands. M. A. Johnstone.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Johnstone:
I must say that I am quite unable to identify your Lorikeet. There
appear to be only two species from Celebes --Psitteuteles meyeri and P.
bonthainensis ; but neither of these quite fit your description, as neither
seems to have any blue ou the head. Your description in many points
agrees with the Scaly-breasted Lorikeet ( P. chlorolepidotus) of Australia,
but you doubtless know this species well. I wish there were some means
of comparing your bird with the specimens in the British Museum.

To the Hon. Correspo 7 idence Secretary:
Sir, --I would feel much obliged for your advice respecting a Le
Vaillant's Amazon that has been in my possession for the last two months.
He won't touch fruit, hemp seed, monkey nuts, or, in fact anything
that my other Amazons partake of ; eating only a very little white sun-
flower seed, and his digestion appears to be seriously impaired in con-
sequence.
For a couple of hours in the morning, and also for a short period in
the evening, he appears the picture of health, climbing about his cage and
turning somersaults round the perches, showing every desire to be taken
notice of, and offering his head to be scratched.
F&amp;apos;or the remainder of the day, however, he sits with his head under
the wing coverts, and his feathers ruffled up, appearing to be constipated,
and a rattling noise occasionally proceeding from his throat. I attribute
his state wholly to the fact of his eating only sunflower seed, but
although I have tried everything he will touch nothing except this
article of diet, which I should say must, by itself, be very unwholesome
unless accompanied by fruit, green food or some other special diet.
D. s. Morse.
Mr. Morse writes later to the Hon. and Rev. Canon Dutton:
I have been again trying boiled Indian corn for the last few days

with most favourable results, the hen making a hearty meal of it in the
mornings.
The Epsom salts you suggested has worked wonders, and the whole
of to-day and yesterday he has not shown the slightest inclination to sleep,
and appears the picture of health.
With regard to boiled maize, I have always made it the staple diet of
my talking birds of both these species, several of which have been in my
possession for close on twenty years, and appear in perfect health and
plumage. The maize being, of course, supplemented later in the day with
sunflower seed, some monkey nuts, fruit, hemp seed, etc. None of my
large Parrots or Cockatoos, with the exception of a Goffln, will touch
canary seed. I boil the maize over night for about an hour, leaving it to
strain on a cullender which I place on a warm range in the morning, just
long enough to allow the corn to be dry and warm without getting hard,
and the Greys and Amazons appear to enjoy it immensely. I find it also
much appreciated in this warm state by my Jendaya and Halfmoon Conures
in outdoor aviary, especially in cold weather. By the way what hardy birds
the Jendayas appear to be. I turned out a pair last autumn into an
unheated outdoor aviary, where they have thriven splendidly, bathing even
on days when their bath was frozen. I also turned out a pair of Blue-
crowned Cranes, by way of experiment, in the middle of December last, and
they are now in perfect health and plumage. They appeared to enjoy their
first snow storm immensely, holding out their wings to catch the descending
flakes and talking to each other in their extraordinary note that is more
like the croaking of a Jay than anything else.
Canon Dutton, writing to Dr. Butler, re the above, remarks :
"It seems rather like my Guilding's, only mine does eat other seed.
But I am increasing the sunflower, as its plumage gives me the idea of being
too dry--not oily enough--and I am actually giving bread and milk. I don't
know however that it eats an}'.
I am recommending a mixture of seeds, J hemp, f- white sunflower,
oats, canary, millet in equal proportions, and occasional Epsom salts for
tlie drink.
I don't think Mr. Morse's bird sounds as if having much the matter,
but if he keeps Amazons, he probably knows, and if he says its "not right"
I suppose it is'nt.
I am proposing to send my Guilding's to the Zoo, and Dr. Mitchell
suggests putting it with theirs (Mr. Rothschild's ?) in a large compart-
ment in the Fish House. If the Fish House is as warm as the Parrot
House, that is an admirable idea. They might breed. But I am satisfied

these St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and Dominica Parrots want a great deal of
moist heat.*
If a bird was doing well on sunflower, I should say let well alone.
But then Mr. Morse doesn't think his bird is doing well.
I thought we agreed that our experiences tallied that birds rejected
the boiled maize as they grew adult. I can't get the adults to look at it."

SILKWORMS ; THE CEDAR BIRD ; CIRL BUNTING'S SONG.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9988865" page_id="32958884"  page_num="Page 208" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- I note a query in the Avicultural Magazine whether anyone
has tried young silkworms for insectivorous birds. I have, and they seem
to relish them if fed on mulberry leaves but refuse those fed on lettuce
leaves. I now have some eggs of the silk moth which I will send to anyone
who would like to try the experiment with young birds. The eggs will
soon hatch if put in a moist heat. I have never seen any of my birds eat
the moth itself except Chaffinches, who however reject the wings.
In regard to the Waxwing, or Cedar-bird + as it is called in North
America, they eat rowan berries, cranberries, but chiefly the berry of the
red cedar, which is a small slate-coloured berry about the size of a caper.
I have seen them in flocks in a cedar grove in the winter when the ground
was covered with snow. I think few people in England cultivate the poke
berry, which is invaluable for the Mocking-bird and Cat-bird, also the wild
cherry.
I have a pair of Cirl Buntings, in perfect health and plumage; they
are quite tame, and the cock, in addition to his own song, imitates a Canary
who is in the cage next to him, and then winds up with a Thrusli-call,
which I consider rather odd as I have no Thrush in my bird-room. I call
him " Tommy " and he answers chirk , and always begins his long song with
chirk, chirck, cherree, cherree, cherree, and then a whistle, a few soft notes
which turn into a Canary trill, a pause--and then the Thrush-call. I shall
persevere with him and see if he will extend his repertoire. I thought this
account might interest you as I have always heard that Cirl Buntings are
considered dull as cage birds. AiyvS Gorter.

Parrots, if they rejected the maize.--A. G. 13.

Correspondence , Notes, etc.
Quintin (March 8tli) is of much interest as, so far as we are aware, Turnix
dussumieri has never laid eggs before in this country.
" I thought that you would be interested to hear that my Hemipodes
(71 dussumieri), are thinking of nesting, although in a cage. They are
excited and inclined to run at my hands when I am giving food, etc. The
female has barely assumed her nuchal bands. Up to ten days ago I used to
find thirty or forty of the spotted neck feathers daily shed about the cage.
Yesterday I found an egg laid ou the sand, but in no " scratch," and they
had pecked a hole in it. It is like some varieties of the Tree Sparrows' eggs
(coarse pepper and salt), and very little larger, but of a true " game-egg"
shape. Unluckily I start for the South of France in a day or two, and I fear
no good will come of it, for I have no space in a warmed aviar}&amp;apos; that I can
well give up to them."
RESIGNATION of the HON. BUSINESS SECRETARY.
The Committee have accepted with regret the resignation

Kach bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Cinnamon Dove (Miss R. Alderson). [Bird died of haemorrhage from the liver, which was
ruptured. This may have been caused by an injury. You could have done nothing
for it].
Violet Dove (Miss Alderson). [Am afraid your bird died of exhaustion from want of food,
as there was not a grain to be found in the alimentary canal].
Mynah (Mrs. Kirkwood). Fed on boiled rice, potatoes, currants, carrot, egg, meat, and
fruit occasionally. [Your bird had an apoplectic fit and was more or less comatose
when you found him. When in this state for any length of time it usually proves
fatal].
Virginian Nightingale (Mrs. C. Fogg Elliot). [Your bird died of actuteenteritis. Will you
kindly observe Rules re description of symptoms and as to forwarding birds as soon
after death as possible. Your other bird was too decomposed for satisfactory
examination].
Rufous-tailed Grassfinch (Mr. A. J. Darling). [Your bird died of exhaustion as a
result of long standing malassimilation. These delicate birds are frequently sent
over to this country in cages without any grit. There is as a result (especially with the
more delicate ones) chronic indigestion produced and malassimilation of food. When
later on they are provided with proper food and grit, etc., the stronger ones recover
but the more delicate succumb. Before you can treat cases satisfactorily you must
learn to diagnose disease, which in the delicate mites is very difficult].;
Zebra Waxbii.l, hen. (Capt. B. Horsbrugh). [Your bird died of egg binding],
Firefinch and Rufous-tailed Grassfinch (Capt. Horsbrugh). [Firefincli died of acute
inflammation of bowels. Rufous-tail died of pneumonia. Many thanks for P.O.
2/6. Replies sent per post].
Tanager (Mrs. Noble). [Your bird was much emaciated and smelled very strongly of
paraffin. The immediate cause of death was acute inflammation of the bowels.
Paraffin is a very dangerous ingredient for any lotion to be applied to a large portion
of any animal's body at one time, it causes so much irritation by being absorbed into
the system. That it is a good parasiticide we will acknowledge, but inasmuch as
insect life is far less susceptible to the effects of most drugs than are the higher
animals, it necessitates a deal of care in the application of drastic remedies, and I
would certainly advise the abolition of paraffin].
Grey Parrot (Mr. Wrigglesworth). [Your bird died of acute enteritis. Boiled maize
alone is not sufficiently nutritious for any length of time : wheat, dari, oats, canary,
millet, and a little hemp should be tried, and also fruit],
Bibfinch (Mrs. Robertson). [Acute pneumonia was the cause of death].
Crossbill (Mr. G. C. Swailes). [Your bird died of concussion of brain and I should be
inclined to suspect the Tinamous],

The latest achievement in Ornithology
Extracts from a letter from Mr. J. PARKINSON,.
NATURALIST,
BLACKPOOL, ENGLAND,
October 30th, igoi.
" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot
Parrots which I have reared were brought up on your ^Esthetic
Seeds, which were boiled for about half an hour, and the birds
when old enough they fed upon your famous Parrot Food.
Your Traveller has handled the eggs and seen the young ones
progressing into maturity. More than two hundred people,
from all parts of the country, have visited me in order to see
the Parrots ; and four gentlemen, who are Bird Naturalists,
are presenting me with a Silver Cup, in commemoration of such
an unprecedented accomplishment."
The " BLACKPOOL GAZETTE " of Dec. 4th
Says-- " Mr. Parkinson has apparently solved the problem of
Parrot-rearing, which has troubled Bird Fanciers generally throughout the country, and
his skill in this direction has been recognised by the presentation of two Silver Cups at the

Member of the British Ornithologists' U?iion,
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. \V. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that 'No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing&quot; their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song&quot;, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literarv
speech."--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos;The Birds of Tennyson.' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds bv G. E- Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
"'The Birds of Tennyson' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
*f the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume-those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly lie observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriateH&amp;apos; Tennyson emploj^ed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song&quot; birds. Excellent illustrations by

Phaps elegans.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
There has always been to the present writer a certain
amount of fascination in the Pigeons and Doves of Australia;
there is something far more attractive about the Australian
birds in general than about those of other parts of the
world, with of course a few notable exceptions : the
Parrakeets, for instance, of the Antipodes are much more attrac-
tive in every way than those of Asia or America. Amongst the
Doves of Australia there are many that we rarely if ever see
alive in this country, though others, such as the Diamond, the
Common and Crested Bronzewings, and the Peaceful Doves
come over fairly regularly. Often have I wished, when studying
the magnificent works of Gould, that I should some day have an
opportunity of keeping such birds as the Harlequin Bronze-
wing ( Histriophaps histiionica), the Partridge Bronzewing (Geo-
phaps scripta), or the Brush Bronzewing; hence it was with
much pleasure that I beheld, on the i ith of January last, three
healthy specimens of the last-mentioned species--two males and
a female--in the shop of a London bird-dealer, and, after the
usual bargaining, secured them as my own.
My experience of the Common Bronzewing Pigeon ( Phaps
chalcoptera ) is that some specimens are extremely tame, whereas
others are quite the reverse. Perhaps it is the same with

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
Phaps elegans; at any rate my three specimens are the tamest
Doves I have ever known. When I took them home I put all
three into a warmed aviary, and immediately they got out of
the travelling cage the two cocks commenced to coo and bow to
the hen and to pick up small sticks, with the idea of starting
housekeeping forthwith. My presence did not affect them in
the least, and they walked about round and between my legs as
though they had known me all their lives.
High up in this aviary there were some large bundles of
brushwood securely fastened to the walls and roof, and on one of
these the Bronzewings commenced to build a nest in earnest
within two or three days of their arrival from a London dealer's
shop. All three seemed to be building the nest together at first,
but I noticed that one of the cocks appeared to be more in
favour than the other, so he was left as the happy husband of the
only lady, and the other was removed to spend some few months
at least of his life in single blessedness.
Nest-building now went on in earnest, the hen remaining
aloft whilst the cock fetched twig after twig. I noticed in this
case a habit that I have before observed with some other Doves,
namely that, when building, the cock generally alights with a
piece of twig on the back of the hen, the object being doubtless
to avoid disarranging the nest. Having settled on her back
he bends his head over hers, and she takes the twig and
arranges it in its place while he descends for another.
On January the 21st, just ten days after their arrival, the
first egg was laid, the second following next day, and the birds
commenced to sit, the cock during the day and the hen at night.
On February the 9th one young bird was hatched, the second
egg being clear. This youngster received the most devoted
attention from its parents at first, but later I noticed signs that
all was not going on as well as it should be.
The following appears in my bird diary :
4 ' Feb. 21. Young P. elegans getting well fledged, parents
appear now to cover it only at night.
" Feb. 22. Parents appear to be anxious to nest again--bad
sign.

Feb. 23. Parents building another nest, but continue to feed
young one.
" Feb. 24. Young one nearly fledged.
" March 2. Two eggs in new nest, birds sitting. Young one
appears to have very little in its crop.
" March 3. Young bird on ground in very bad way, very weak
and evidently starved. Try to hand feed it but fail. Put it
back in nest, and later notice cock trying to feed it, but it is
evidently too far gone.
" March 4. Young P. elegans dead."
Such is the miserable history of, possibly, the first young
Brush Bronzewing Pigeon hatched in England. It is a repetition
of what has happened before in my own and other aviaries with
other species of foreign Doves. This strong desire on the part
of birds to nest a second time, before the first brood can shift for
themselves, is a trouble that, I must admit, I cannot account for,
but which is well known amongst aviculturists to occur with
other birds besides Doves.
The bachelor had all this while contented himself,
when not eating or sleeping, with cooing. The note is not
unmusical, but when it is repeated, "hoop, hoop, hoop," at
intervals of about one second throughout the greater part of
the day, it becomes somewhat monotonous, and this bird
generally went by the name of " the hooter." It occurred to
me that this continually-repeated call-note might perhaps have
unsettled the breeding birds, and have been partly accountable
for their want of success in rearing the young one; so I
persuaded my brother to allow my bird to " hoot " for a while in
his aviary at Caterham, where there would be no chance of its
voice being heard by the others.
The days were now lengthening, and I hoped the birds
would behave better with their second brood ; but still I have
so far only partial success to record.
"April 5. Two young nearly fledged, evidently a true
pair, one showing much more buff on the forehead than the
other. Parents inclined to nest again, but at present feed the
young well.

Mrs. Rathborne,
" April 8. Parents building hard. Put a sack over the
nesting site to check them, as the young appear to be neglected.
" April 9. Young ones with empty crops. As the hen has
not been seen to feed them for days, remove her from the aviary.
Cock, having no hen to attract his attention, takes to the young
again and feeds them well. Hen laid egg in other aviary."
I believe, had I left the hen, the young would not have
been looked at again, but having removed her all went well
for a few days. Soon, however, the cock began to get restless
and discontented, cooing for the hen continually, and the young
did not appear to be doing very well. As I write (April 14th)
one is strong and well, though does not appear to feed itself; it
looks like living : but the other is decidedly weak though there
was food in its crop when last examined. I have decided to
try the hen with the other male in the large wire aviary now
that the weather is warmer, and hope for complete success
next time.
(To be continued).

Being very much interested in the Blue and Pied Rock
Thrushes, my husband and I thought we would combine orni-
thology with our little summer trip last year, and look up these
interesting birds in their native haunts.
Solely from its appearance on the map, we selected the
little village of Riva at the top of Pago Garda as a likely place,
we knew absolutely nothing about it, or how to get to it, but it
looked as if it ought to be pretty and above all "Rock
Thrushy." So, calling Dean and Dawson's very kind agent into
consultation, w&amp;apos;e managed to get booked through to Desanzano
at the foot of Dago Garda, from whence a large steamer brought
us up the lake to Riva.
The scenery was exquisite in the brilliant sunshine, and the
orange houses, vineyards, and olive groves made it quite typical

of the South. Our spirits rose high as we sat sipping coffee in
the lovely wooded garden of Mr. Weizmann's comfortable
Hotel de Lac, surrounded by the warbling of inuumerabie
Nightingales and Blackcaps, while the cool Ora breeze from the
lake wafted around us the perfume of thousands of pale pink
roses.
We were up betimes next morning, and made our way to
the foot of some high absolutely precipitous cliffs, at the foot of
which were strewn large boulders and shingle ; as we struggled
and scrambled over these we paused to rest, wdien, suddenly
from far above us on the face of the cliff, burst forth the most
exquisitely wild and operatic whistling--it was the Blue Rock
Thrush--far up we saw him flying from ledge to ledge with slow
hovering flight; whilst lower down our delighted eyes discovered
our little pied friend jerking up and down in a very Chat like
manner. After this we saw them everywhere where there were
cliffs, in fours and fives, the blue predominating. We even saw
them pilfering down in the cherry gardens that ranged along the
foot of the rocks ; we could also see where they had their nests, but
could not possibly get at them, so hearing that broods of young
were occasionally brought into the villages round, we spent
many weary hours walking through every higli-way and bye-way
of Riva and Torbole, gazing up at every window and into every
cage until I am sure the people thought we were demented. We
found several nice adult birds by their song, but, as unfortunately
we did not know a word of Italian except " Passera solitaria"
which we learnt from the Avicultural Magazine ,* we were too
shy to tackle their owners.
At length one day my heart nearly stopped beating, for
there, outside a grocer's door, hung the object of our search, four
Rock Thrushes, two of which were unmistakably young blues,
and unmistakably a pair ; the owner, a jolly fat man, stood at
the door with his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, and
such a benevolent look on his face that, without counting the
cost, we rushed up to him pointing wildly at the birds and
repeating " Passera solitaria ." He immediately burst into
voluble Italian and we collapsed and fled!

I spent the rest of that day trying to pick out suitable
sentences from our Italian conversation book but, alas it was all
" How many waistcoats has your grandfather," and such like
sentences ; but I managed to extract " uccello canoro "-- "quanto
costa "--and "troppo" ; and, armed with these, went back next
day. As we neared the shop our hearts failed ; we passed it and
passed it again. " You go up aud ask him," I said to my
husband ; but he would not see it, so I had to take my courage
in my hand and face him. " Buon giorno " I said. Much
bowing and smiling from our jolly friend followed--" Passera
solitaria " I ventured. Down came the cage, and much
voluble Italian ensued. As soon as a pause came I jerked out
" uccello canoro&quot; --I don't know why, but it was the next word on
my bit of paper, aud I felt I must say something. There was
great gush at this, evidently extolling the beauty of the
" canoro." " Quanto costa ?" came next--30 Kroner for the two.
My husband, who had by this time ventured into the shop,
joined in the emphatic " troppo ," and we left for that day.
Three daj r s after we came back, and this time I felt like
an old friend, so stated the " Quanto costa " gaily. It was still 30
Kroner. I looked indignant and pointed to the hen saying severely
non canoro." He looked bewildered, as I pointed to the
cock and said " canoro " ; then to the hen saying " Non canoro."
He fairly^ beamed then and pointed first to the cock and then to
my husband and from the hen to me ! At last we got him down
to 20 Kroner, when unfortunately, in my eloquent gesticula-
tions, I sent my elbow through a show case on the counter--of
course be bowed and smiled, aud I suppose said it did not
matter ; but I hastened to end the bargain at the price mentioned,
and he threw in a bag of Indian meal and polenta to feed them
on.
I brought these birds home here in triumph. The people
in the train were much amused when they saw us feeding them
with a bit of stick, but they lived and thrived until, to my
everlasting sorrow and regret, a strange blue cock got out
in the aviary and killed the hen. The little Riva cock
revenged his sister by slaying her murderer through the bars of

TURKEY.
Talegalla lathami.
By A. E. L. Bertung,
Head Keeper of the Zoological Society&amp;apos;s Gardens.
Having read Mr. St. Quintin's most interesting communi-
cation in the March number of the Magazine, on the Brush
Turkeys in his possession, and thinking some of our members
may care to know the actual method in which the eggs are
deposited, I subjoin the following account as an appendix to his
paper.
The hens I think have perhaps the easiest time in family
arrangements--unless there is any particular strain in passing
the unusually large white egg--as her partner not only prepares
the receptacle for them, but takes care of the eggs afterwards.
As far as I have observed from the birds now in the Zoo-
logical Society's collection, the hens lay at intervals of about
five days. Shortly before the female is ready to produce the egg
the male opens the mound at the top, throwing out the material
until the heap assumes the shape of a volcanic crater. When he
has completed this to his satisfaction the hen prepares to deposit
her egg by scratching a small hole on the interior wall of the
mound, the cock anxiously looking on as if to superintend
matters. When this small hole is read}&quot; she stands over it in a
somewhat crouching attitude but with head and neck erect, her
wings and tail being spread as if to prevent anyone from seeing
what is about to take place.
The cock, who is exceedingly amorous,--in fact, so much
so, that I wonder the females are not frequently killed--mean-
while walks round his mate in a very restless manner, occasion-
ally peeping under her spread wings as if in a hurry for matters
to come to a conclusion.

On the Nesting Habits of the Brush Turkey.
After standing in this position for about three minutes
the egg is laid, and the hen immediately scrambles over it some
of the warm material from the inner side of the mound, stamp-
ing it firmly down, and, at the same time, rotating first one way
and then the other. When this is completed she leaves the
heap, the cock then putting the finishing touch by filling up the
large cavity he excavated in the first place.
It is surprising that many of the eggs do not get broken,
considering the rough treatment they undergo by being stamped
upon, as they are particularly thin-shelled ; but what has puzzled
me most is the question: "how does the male know the exact
moment that the female is about to lay ? " for he opens the heap
at the right moment. Is it purely instinct, or an absolute
knowledge of the lapse of time? He frequently removes some
material from the upper portion of the mound, either to reduce
the heat or to air the eggs, but not to such an extent as when
the hen is ready to lay.
The temperature of this mound, which I tested at ten
o'clock in the morning, was, at the side where the hens were
observed to lay most frequently, 109* Fahr., i.e., near the surface,
whilst on the opposite side the thermometer rose to 84* only, and
deeper down in the mound to 65(R). By this it would seem that
the upper portion only generates the heat to any considerable
extent. The external temperature at that time was 54*. The
mound is composed of leaf mould, lawn mowings, light loam,
decaying leaves and fern bracken, to which a barrow-full of
short, broken hay, straw, and clover is occasionally added, as it
mixes well with the other materials and prevents the decaying
grass from running the temperature too high, which it has a
tendency to do, and helps to shoot off some of the rain which
generally arrives when least wanted.
There are, to my belief, a number of eggs in the mound at
the present time, laid by two hens, and I am hoping to be
able to write a further paper later, treating on the hatching and
growth of the chicks, should we be so lucky as to get any.

FINCH.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
Most dealers will tell you that Siictoptera bichenovii can be
readily sexed by the width of the black bands encircling the
throat and breast; but the late Mr. Joseph Abrahams relied more
upon the superior size and darker crown of the cock bird ;
nevertheless that even he, with his vast experience, was some-
times wrong in his determinations, is evident from the following
facts.
In 1899 Mr. Abrahams wrote to me that he wished me to
try for the Bicheno x Zebra-finch hybrid; therefore about
August of that year he sent me a bird which purported to be a
cock Bicheno's Finch. I at once paired it up with a hen Zebra-
Finch, putting the pair into one of my flight-cages and providing
them with a nesting receptacle and building material; the two
birds simply ignored one another, one roosting in the nest-box
at night and the other outside.
Seeing that the supposed cock had very narrow bands
across throat and breast, I wrote and told Mr. Abrahams that I
thought he must have inadvertently sent me a hen in mistake
for a cock. He replied that he had been very busy at the time,
so that it was just possible he might have done so ; he was now,
however, sending me another bird which he was quite confident
was a genuine male: with his usual generosity he desired me to
keep both, and see what I could do with them.
Strangely enough the hen Zebra-finch with the first bird
died egg-bound; and that with the second bird was twice egg-
bound previous to April 1900; although no nests had been built
in either cage. On April 15th the first Bicheno's Finch was
taken ill, and died that night.
In the case of the second bird--the "genuine male,"
although I changed its hen several times, there was no result up
to February 1903. Thinking that, in this case as in the other,
the sexing might have been wrong, I now substituted a cock
Zebra-finch for the hen. The two birds became quite friendly,
went to roost together, but no eggs were laid.

Mr. W. H. Workman,
In February 1904 I turned the Bicheno's Finch out into
my long covered aviary ; and was interested, shortly afterwards,
to notice its appropriation of one of the Hartz-cages, which it
defended against all comers: after all, I thought, this bird must
surely be, as Mr. Abrahams said " a genuine male" ; but I could
not make up my mind as to what bird it intended to take to wife:
at times I saw it apparently conversing with a hen Zebra-finch
(the only bird in the aviary which spoke its language), yet at
other times it seemed to take no notice of her.
The bird was in excellent health, and I confidently looked
forward to a reward for all my patience and perseverance ; when
(to my horror), on March 28th, I discovered this " genuine male"
panting on the floor of the aviary, evidently very badly egg-
bound. She died about two hours later.
If all the sexual characters upon which Mr. Abrahams
relied fail in this species, how shall we distinguish the cock from
the hen : that so excellent a judge should have sent me two hens
as cocks, is I think clear proof that the true sexual differences
in Stictoptera bichenovii have yet to be discovered, and one needs

By W. H. Workman, M.B.O.U.
For a long time I had wanted to visit a pretty County
Antrim stream that flows into Lough Neagh, and at last the
opportunity came and my friend and I started off by an early
train to this pretty spot. There is nothing like getting away
early on the short winter days if one wants the brightest part
of the day for observing the birds of the district visited.
We arrive at our destination by 10 o'clock and immediately
make for the stream which runs at the far end of this typical
North of Ireland village. We get off the road as soon as possible
and strike across the fields to the water's edge : at this time of
year it is a fast flowing little river swelled by the recent rains.
We do not go very far before we come across some Magpies, but
on trying to approach they soon put the stream and fields

between us and them. Shortly after we come upon a pair of
Blue Tits feeding in a Larch ; I am certain they are a pair for, no
matter where one flies the other follows at once. I wonder if
these little birds pair for life ? It certainly looks like it in this
case. Not far off a Wren is feeding up and down the branches
and round the roots of an old tree. This time last year out in
Algiers I heard the Wrens singing most beautifully just as they
do with us in late spring. It is wonderful how tame these little
birds are. I remember once when trying the pattern of a new
12-bore gun. noticing how tame Blue and Coal Tits were, for in
a hedge within two yards of me they fed while I fired off cartridge
after cartridge; it did not seem to disturb them in the least.
Now&amp;apos; we are at a bend of the stream and have to get over
a high fence before we again reach the river's edge. I stop
suddenly and signal to my friend not to move for there, perched
on a stone at the other side of the river, is what I take to be a
Dipper. Up go our glasses and we carefully examine this little
bird which is new to me except in pictures and mounted speci-
mens, and nothing that I know of gives more pleasure than
seeing a species new to one, except perhaps the finding of a new
one, but that is a state of bliss awarded to very few ornithologists ;
and these occasions will be fewer and fewer as the darker parts
of our globe become more civilised, and I am afraid in many
cases spoilt from a Naturalist's point of view. For myself I
always look back with pleasure on those red-letter days when I
have seen something new to me. Well do I remember my first
view of Golden Plover in breeding plumage on the Island of
Canna, and Buzzards at another place on the West Coast of
Scotland. But to return to our Dippers or Water Ouzels ; we
follow them down the river until they turn and fly back--we
have heard that the different pairs of this species have their
regular beats on the river, and shortly after we come on
another pair. One can only make out the white throat-patch
poised above a stone, as the brown water blends so well with the
colouring of the bird, making it quite impossible to see the out-
line. We have now reached the bridge, and the Dippers coming
here to the end of their beat turn and fly up stream.
Crossing the road we get on to the river again, passing on

our way an old flax mill now peopled only by Jackdaws, and in
the trees round about we notice several Rooks. Soon after my
friend notices some Redpolls and, away to the left, I spot some
Ivy-covered trees which might contain an Owl, so we cut across
the fields, but draw a blank. As we return I put up a Snipe
from a marshy place, and shortly afterwards a great Grey Heron
flaps slowly over our heads.
We now make straight for Rough Neagh, passing on the
wa}*- numbers of Blackbirds, Thrushes, House Sparrows and
Chaffinches, in a few minutes arriving at the edge of the great
inland sea that has been more or less shrouded in mystery from
the days when Thomas Moore wrote--
" On Lough Neagh's banks as the fisherman strays
When the clear cool eve's declining,
He sees the round towers of other days
In the waves beneath him shining."
Recently there have been discussions in the daily papers
about the strange booming heard by the farmers round the
Ipugh, as if great guns were practising, and nobody seems to
be able to explain it, altho' the same thing has been heard on
some large American lakes.
But to return to our birds--soon after we reach the edge
we come on some Meadow and Rock Pipits who alight quite close
and do not seem to mind us in the least. Now we enter a thick
Willow bed. What are the brightly coloured birds I see flying
out at the other side ? We follow as noiselessly as possible and
soon come on a flock of Bullfinches, all the males in splendid
colour. It is a strange thing why a Bullfinch should lose its
beautiful colouring so much more than any other cage bird ;
those I have seen kept in small cages, after a time changed to a
dull brown tint and, but for their shape, one could hardly have
told what they were. I have often wondered why this is so when
small foreign birds of the parrot and finch tribe keep their
brilliant colouring so well.
We now near the river again. This is a great place for
bird life, and I note tracks of many waders in the soft mud at
the river's mouth. Out to sea is a large flock of Ducks, some
sleeping and others keeping watch. One does not often catch a

wild duck napping. I believe these are Golden Eye (Clangula
glaucion ) but the distance is great and light in a winter after-
noon is not the best for a high-power reflecting glass.
Round about us are Willows where many birds, such as
Great Tits, Sparrows, and numbers of other common birds are
feeding. We now turn train-ward, following the stream towards
the station, just as we start out flies a Waterhen from the near
bank and makes off towards the reed-beds at the mouth. Now a
flock of Wood-Pigeons fly across our path in their usual out-of-
range-hurry style. A large flock of Thrush-like birds alight in a
field in front, and. on a nearer approach we find them to be those
most wary of birds, Fieldfares, accompanied as usual with a few
Missel Thrushes and numbers of the ubiquitous Starling. Pass-
ing this by we reach a hedge covered with bright red berries--a
splendid feast for numbers of the small birds, and here we come
across Yellow-hammers as yellow as Canaries, Hedge Sparrows,
Tin nets, Corn Buntings, Chaffinches, and many other birds I had
not time to identify. As our time is now limited we make for
the station after having had a pleasant day with nature, noting
about twenty-three different species of birds.

danger, seeing that the rivers, the only highways in a densely
wooded country, contain innumerable rapids through which only
small boats can be navigated.
Following the Orinoco as far as Niapire, the author then
proceeded to explore the Caura, in the first expedition (1897-98)
reaching Temblador, and in the second (1900-01) the Mountain
Auffiha which he intended if possible to climb, but was unable.
The hardships endured during this expedition would certainly
have killed most men, and on several occasions it looked very
much as if the author would never live to return home. For
long distances the country is uninhabited by human beings, and
it is consequently impossible to procure provisions ; and the
immense difficulty of transporting sufficient for the long
journey in the moderate-sized dug-outs can be imagined. At
the very commencement of fhe return journey the largest boat,
containing all the provisions, collections, journal containing
extensive notes, and in fact everything that was of most value to
the party, was wrecked in an attempt to navigate the Arachi
Rapids, and starvation stared the expedition in the face. Two
natives deserted, and the guide died of starvation.
Through all this trying expedition the author carefully
studied the natural history of the country through which he
passed, and his notes on the birds especially are very interesting.
When writing of the Tonca-bean, the gathering of which forms
one of the principal industries in the country, the author tells
us that " during the mouths of October and November, while
the fruit is still quite small and green, the large Macaws and
several other members of the Parrot family commit great havoc
upon the young crop. No birds are more extravagant than
Parrots in their method of feeding, not so much on account of
what they consume as of what they waste. Wherever these
birds have eaten, the ground is strewn with fruit only chewed and
then awkwardly dropped, or perhaps with just a small piece
bitten off. Hence the destruction before maturity of enormous
quantities of this valuable product."
Of the Bell-bird the author observes:--"The Campanero,
' the bellman,' as the natives call the bird, is rarely met with in
the neighbourhood of cultivated spots. The presence of man

appears distasteful to this lover of primeval forests, and if his
domain be encroached upon by human beings, he immediately
abandons it to retire to some distant recess, where he can enjoy
the solitude he loves so well."
One of the chief exports of the town of Cuidad-Bolivar
on the Orinoco consists of feathers, chiefly the plumes of two
species of Egrets, which can only be obtained in the breeding
season. " The small Egret ( Ardea candidissima) produces the
most valuable plumes ; from the larger birds ( Ardea garzetta) a
coarser feather is obtained which is not so much appreciated,
but the wily dealer can sort his plumes so as to introduce a fair
proportion of the inferior article without danger of detection.
Quite a number of birds have to be slaughtered to produce a
pound of feathers, only a few drooping plumes from the backs of
the birds being taken. The season for collecting extends through
the months of June, July, and August; that is, through the
mating and breeding period.In spite of the slaughter of
thousands of these birds, the garceros continue to be used by the
Egrets, but in ever diminishing numbers. The beauty of a few
feathers on their backs will be the cause of their extinction. The
love of adornment common to most animals is the source of their
troubles. The graceful plumes which they doubtless admire in
each other have appealed to the most destructive of all animals.
They are doomed, because the women of civilised countries
continue to have the same fondness for feathers and ornaments
characteristic of savage tribes."
The trees on some of the islands in the Caura were
frequently used by whole colonies of Hang-nests which were
rearing their young at the time our author ascended the river.
" Some of the trees were literally covered with nests placed so
close together that it would be impossible to find room for an
additional one. The biggest colonies were those of the Yellow
Cassique ( Cassicus albirostris) and the Scarlet-backed Cassique
(Cassicus hcemorrhous ).Both Cassiques are favourite cage-
birds in Venezuela, but the yellow variety, being commoner, is
seen much more frequently in houses than the other. While in
Venezuela the Yellow Cassique is called Arrendajo , it is known
as Oropendola in Colombia."

Two coloured plates of birds, and many charming black
and white illustrations grace the pages of this very interesting
volume. One of the latter is reproduced with this notice by the
kind permission of the publishers.
PHEASANTS*
This standard work of the veteran ornithologist, Mr.
Tegetmeier, is so well known to all who take any interest in the
magnificent group of which it treats, that there is not much to
be said in introducing it to our members. No one who keeps
Pheasants, either for the covert or in the aviary, can possibly
afford to be without this book. The advice as to the treatment of
the birds and the rearing of their young is sound and practical to
a degree, and we may say that nearly everything that is worth
knowing about Pheasants can be learnt from its pages.
The fourth edition which is now published is enlarged
and brought thoroughly up to date, and although it is, as
before, offered at the very moderate price of 7/6, no less than
six very beautiful coloured plates are given, in addition to the
numerous black plates and text illustrations that have appeared
in the former editions.
The coloured plates represent the Mongolian Pheasant
(Phasianus mongo liens&amp;apos;), the Common Pheasant (P. colchicus ), the
Chinese Pheasant (P. torquatus), the Japanese Pheasant (P. versi-
color), Reeve's Pheasant ( P. reevesi), and Hagenbeck's Pheasant
(P. hagenbeckii). They have been drawn by Mr. Frohawk,
and reproduced by the three-colour process, which in this case
has been eminently successful, the pictures being barely
distinguishable by the ordinary individual from good chromos.
Hagenbeck's Pheasant is a magnificent form, inhabiting the
Kobdo Valley, N. W. Mongolia. It was described by the Hon.
Walter Rothschild at a meeting of the British Ornithologists'
Club on Nov. 20th, 1901 : and in April 1903 a large number of
Pheasants; apparently belonging to this identical form, were

exposed for sale in the London Markets, having arrived in a
frozen state. This Pheasant has not, up to the present time, been
seen in a living state in this country, though Mr. Tegetmeier
tells us that a variety of the common Pheasant which can hardly
be distinguished from P. hagenbecki , occasionally appears in the
coverts at Elsenham and elsewhere.
One of the most interesting and satisfactory introductions
of late years is the fine species known as the Prince of Wales's
Pheasant (P. principalis ), from North Afghanistan, which is
ornamented by pure white wing-coverts. It was described by
Mr. Sclater in 1885, and shortly after some living specimens
were received at the Zoological Gardens, but these, unfortunately,
died without having produced any young. In February, 1903,
Colonel Marsden Sunderland imported a large number .of these
Pheasants, and turned them down into large enclosures in
Hampshire, where they laid very freely, the eggs hatched
exceedingly well and numbers were reared successfully. A
magnificent male of the year which had been reared wild was
exhibited stuffed, at a meeting of the British Ornithologist's
Club in December last, as well as a female in the flesh. By the
kind permission of the publishers we give with the present
number, an illustration of the Phasianus principalis from Mr.
Tegetmeier's book.

THICKHEADS.
Sir ,--Apropos of the beautiful plate in your December number,
you may perhaps be interested in hearing something of Pachycephala in
captivity.
I have kept both the White-throated and Rufous-breasted Thickheads.
They very soon get on to Lark food if kept in a cage, especially when
associated with a smaller bird, such as a Malurvs, to teach them to feed.
The diet is varied with egg food, house fly maggots, and meal or
wire worms.
They get very tame and will readily feed from the hand.
One met his death from this, as he followed me through the aviary
porch door which I accidentaly shut on him.
The song of the Rufous bird is a particularly sweet whistle, starting
high and running down the scale.
Like so many of our birds, his mode of attracting the hen is by
dancing. His method is different from any of the other dancers I keep
as he puts his head on one side and, grasping the bough firmly, jumps
violently up and down.
They are not bad birds in an aviary, and never interfere with even the
tiniest of African Finches, though two cocks fought savagely.
I am hoping to get them to sit for photos, and will, if you care for
them send you copies. HEEEN Bowie.
Melbourne, Australia.
[We are very much obliged to Miss Bowie for her interesting letter,
and we hope that some enterprising person may bring a few of these birds
to the old country and give some of us at home an opportunity of keeping
Pachycephala in our aviaries. We should like to receive the photos which
Miss Bowie so kindly offers, and, if suitable for reproduction, and funds
permitting, to publish them in this Magazine.--E d.]

Sir, _I want to ask you how to keep a pair of Lophophaps plumijera,
which I bought the other day. I have them at present in a longish cage
which I keep half covered for they seem very timid, and give them canary
and millet seed. I have put sand and limestone at the bottom of the cage
and a handful of hay on which they usually huddle at night. The upper
part of their beak is very long and widens at the point. Never having
seen other specimens of this Dove before I do not know whether this is
natural or whether their beak has grown unnaturally. I have put a cuttle-
fish bone in the cage on which they could rub their beak if they chose. I
should like to put them in the aviary or in the bird-room where they would
have more room to run about in, but want to know whether they would
agree with other doves and other birds. I have several doves, the Indian
Green Wing, the Diamond Dove (both these have nested and brought up
young ones), the Passerine Dove, the Afra, and the Talpacoti. I have also
a fine pair of Lophotes, but these are as yet in a cage.
Is th &amp; plumifera delicate, and does it require heat ?
GuiqiA Tommasi.
The following reply has been sent to the Countess Baldelli.
Lophophaps is so rare in the English market, that very few
aviculturists here have had any experience of it as an aviary&amp;apos; bird. It was
bred in our Zoological Gardens in 1S95 ; but unfortunately I do not possess
the volume of ' the Proceedings' for that year; so that I am unable to tell
you how the birds were kept.
Being natives of the hot sandy plains of the interior, where they
bask in the intense heat of the sun, nesting in a hollow scratched in the
ground under the shelter of herbage, they would probably require a warm
sunny aviary.
I should be afraid to associate them with any of the small doves of
the New World, most of which are very pugnacious; nor do I think they
would be safe with Green-winged Doves ; which, though generally
apathetic, will at times drive about doves of twice their own bulk.
If any doves are delicate, the Plumed Doves ought to be: if I had a
pair I should keep them in an indoor aviary and turn out all other
doves. I have not found any dove quarrelsome with birds of the other
Orders, but finches will sometimes pluck out their feathers to line their
nests with.
I can find no mention of a distorted upper mandible as a natural
character in Lophophaps; I think if such had been the case, it would have
been noted in the British Museum Catalogue.

[The pair of Lophophapsplumifera that bred at the Zoo. in 1895, nested
iu the grass in one of the smaller compartments of the Western Aviary.
One egg was dropped some distance from the nest where it was placed by
the keeper. The birds sat well and, so far as we can remember, the young
were able to run when a few days old. These birds do not appear to be
particularly delicate, and an outdoor aviary in Italy should suit them all
the year round ; growing grass appears to be absolutely necessary if they
are expected to nest.-- Ed.] ^

SPARROWS NESTING IN NILE FERRY-BOATS; WINTER
QUARTERS OF THE COMMON QUAIL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99029355" page_id="32958923"  page_num="Page 231" year="" vol="">
Our Member Mr. Percival, writing from the Nile between Berber and
Khartoum, narrates the following incident :--" When I was here before I
noticed, while crossing the ferry, a cock Sparrow flying round the boat and
settling on the edge now and then, but thought nothing of it at the time.
Yesterday (February 26th) however, while I was waiting by the same boat, I
saw a pair of Sparrows playing about close by, and then noticed the cock enter
a hole in the side of the boat, and 011 examination found that there was a
nest in the hole but could not detect whether there were eggs or not. The
hole is only just above the water line, and is just under the (apologies for)
rowlocks. The boat is used night and day, and constantly carrying both
men and animals. The bird had all the appearance of being the ubiquitous
House Sparrow of smoky old London."
Referring to statements which have been made that it is not known
where the Quails (Coturnix coturnix) that arrive in Egypt, etc., every
Autumn pass the Winter months, and to a request I have made that he
should be on the look out for them, Mr. Percival now writes as follows:--
"It may interest you to hear that Quail abound at El Obeid, seven days by
camel south-west from Khartoum. My namesake obtained about fifty in
one morning." El Obeid is the capital of Kordofan, and lies about 22a
miles S.W. of Khartoum.--R. P.

Sir, --I find in my letter on the above subject in last month's Maga-

removal of some of the more delicate birds from the Aviary&amp;apos;, last winter
but one, to a Conservatory.

I fell.into an error, for which the local press are responsible, and which

Mrs. Walker corrects in a letter to the " Southport Visitor " of the 9th inst.
It appears that the Committee themselves took the course mentioned on
their own initiative, only as a kind of concession to public opinion, and
not on the suggestion of the Society.
I am glad to make this correction as it seems that Mrs. Walker pro-
tested at the time against placing the birds in a Conservatory, holding, and
rightly so, that the moist heat would be injurious to them.
John Sergeant.
Sir,--M r. Sergeant has asked me to express my views as to the
suitability for Foreign Birds of an aviary facing due North.
I think there can be no difference of opinion upon a question of this
kind, in the minds of any experienced bird-owners : for all sun-loving birds
an aviary should be so situated as to secure all the warmth and sunlight
available in this inclement country : therefore, as a North aspect secures
less of these requisites than any other, it must of necessity be extremely
bad.
It is possible that the Corporation of Southport might have done
worse, for had they provided a N.k). aspect the birds would have had (as
Punch once put it) " the full benefit of a delicious N.E. wind," which would
undoubtedly have encouraged the development of pulmonary disease: it
will probably arrive before long, to decimate the Southport aviary, under
the auspices of a North wind; but may not be quite so deadly.
Temporarily, doubtless, the great advantage of fresh air (as opposed
to the closeness of a bird-shop) has a tendency to invigorate even delicate
foreigners; so that, for a season even the vilest conditions of open air
exercise are partly nullified by the fact that it is exercise in a pure atmos-
phere; but later on the more delicate must succumb.
A. G. BUTEER.
Sir,--T he Southport Corporation are making an interesting
experiment.
Of course all a priori reasoning would say it is cruel and foolish,
but if thej- succeed in establishing that a northern exposure is the right
aspect for an aviary they will establish a very remarkable fact.

Sir,--D o you consider a Dyal-bird difficult to keep in good health ?
and do you consider it as good or a better singer than a Sliama ? I have one
of the former on approval, and possess the latter, which I consider a most

I feed it on soaked ants' eggs with a little Century food, three or four
mealworms a day, now and then a few cockroaches and small garden worms.

The following reply has been sent to Mr. Moerschell:
You will find a Dyal quite as easy to keep as a Shdma, and it will
thrive on the same food as the latter.
It is not, however, so good a singer as the Sliauia, although pleasant
to listen to; but very few birds of any kind equal the Shatna in power of
song.
The Dyal makes an equally good pet. F. Finn.
ORNAMENTAL WATERFOWL.
Sir, --Would your readers kindly advise me as to the places to get
reliable Waterfowl at reasonable prices, as I am desirous of collecting a nice
variety for the Public Park here.
Has any one succeeded in breeding the Black-necked Swans in this
country, and what is the general opinion as to the hardiness of Black
Swans, as we have lost three females and one male in a short time ? They
appear delicate. Three females came from the Scilly Isles, and were,
possibly, much in-bred. At what age do they usually breed.
J. Viner LEEDER.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Viner Leeder:
The best places for getting Waterfowl are Messrs. Bailey's in Mount
Street, Loudon, and Mr. Castang's in Leadenhall Market. Mr. J. Hamlyn,
of 221, St. George's Street East, London, often has some, as has also Mr.
Jamrach, in the same street.
The Black-necked Swan has been bred in the Zoological Gardens at
all events, and possibly elsewhere in England.
Black Swans are usually found quite hardy. The three females which
died were very likely, as you suggest, in-bred. I cannot say at what age
they breed, but should expect them to do so in their third year.
F. Finn.
THE STRIPE-THROATED SIVA.
It is worth mentioning that a specimen of this species (Siva
strigula) was recently imported by Mr. J. Hamlyn, this being, so far as I
am aware, its first appearance in the trade. Indeed, I never saw it on sale
even in India, though in the Indian Museum there was a skin of an
individual which had been in captivity. Mr. Hamlyn's bird, which was
sold almost at once, w r as in absolutely perfect condition, and a most
attractive creature. In action and build it reminded me of the Greater
White-throat, although of course a larger bird. In general form and size it

resembled the now familiar Blue-winged Siva, but was longer and slenderer,
&amp;apos;pjie wings and tail in this species are marked with orange instead of blue,

<bodyText confidence="0.98644265625" page_id="32958926"  page_num="Page 234" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I have a nest of Cherry-finches: the eldest of the nestlings
\0x25A0came out of the cocoanut husk in which it was hatched on Saturday
(April 2nd), the second on Sunday, and the cock bird so often goes into the
husk that I do not feel quite certain that they are all out yet.
I cannot find a record of their having been bred in this country
Before, in any of my books. And yet it seems almost impossible that
these can be the first. They have had no special attention paid them, and
have nested without fuss or trouble. The hen has been ill for some time,
and has not, I think, done much of the feeding, and yesterday she died.
The cock is most devoted to the youngsters, who are well feathered, active,
and large, and are even now using their bills, though I don't fancy they
actually eat anything. Lilian Williams.
The following reply has been sent to Mrs. Howard Williams:
Mr. Cronksliaw bred one Cherry-fincli in 1895 and Miss Husband bred
three in 1S9S; others may have succeeded subsequently, but these two
instances will suffice. I only got as far as eggs myself.

WINTERING FOREIGN BIRDS OUT OF DOORS.
Sir,--I think it will interest you to hear that I have succeeded in
wintering in my outdoor aviary five Green Singing-finches, four Avadavats,
four Red-billed Weavers, pairs of Black-headed and White-bellied Manni-
kins, a hen Bronze-winged Mannikin, a pair of Silverbills, a hen Bengali, a
pair of Spice-fiuclies, a pair of Chinese Buntings, three Zebra-finch liens, a
hen White and a pair of Grey Javas, a cock Orange Bishop, a pair of Ribbon-
finches and about fifty Canaries. I removed the majority of the Canaries
in February.
I have lost three cock Zebra-finclies, a pair of Zebra Waxbills, a pair
of Nonpareil Buntings, two Wliite-bellied Mannikins, a hen Green Singing-
finch, and a hen Avadavat. I cannot account for the deaths of the Zebra-
finches, and wish that I had sent one at least to Mr. Gill. The Zebra
Waxbills were only bought last July, three months too late, and I attribute
the loss of the Nonpareils to the want of sufficient insect food.

My Red-billed Weavers moulted in December, and were very ragged
for about three weeks, but are now very smart though out of colour. One
of my Avadavats is still in half-colour but gradually assuming undress.
With the exception of the hen White Java Sparrow and one of the Zebra-
finches none have attempted to breed.
I have taken careful notice of the roosting places selected by the
various birds, and have found that the Mannikins, Javas, Zebras, Silverbills,
Bengali and Cutthroats roost in the wooden shelter, in bushes, etc. The
Singing-finches have taken possession of two cypress trees, the Spice-
finches, Avadavats, Orange-cheeks, Waxbills and Buntings sleep in the
privet hedge, and the Weavers in box trees. I am satisfied that the latter
are as hard as Sparrows. All are in splendid condition, with the exception
of one of the Orange-cheeks which is rather ragged and has lost its tail,
but appears to be healthy.
I think you will agree with me that the past winter has been a trying
one. For the last fortnight we have had almost continuous Easterly and
North-Easterly wind, and plenty of it, with hail, rain, snow and frosts at
intervals. R. SuGGiTT.

Sir, --Can you tell me what sort of food I ought to give my Zebra
Finches while they are breeding ? Twice they have nested, and when
the young birds were half grown they seemed to neglect them, consequently
the young birds died. They are in an outdoor aviary, and have been left
very quiet. They were given soft-food and millet, etc., but I feel sure there
is some special food that I ought to give them to feed the young ones
with. I should be much obliged if you would tell me what to do.
Adelaide Dawnay.
The following reply has been sent to the Lady Adelaide Dawnay :
I have bred Zebra-finches when fed upon, seed only, indeed I have
young in the nest which are being fed upon this food now; but I feel sure
that more satisfactory results are obtained when good soft-food containing
egg and ants' egg is supplied in a separate pan. I must have bred, from
first to last, over a hundred of these little birds, and I usually supply them
with the same food which I prepare for my insectivorous birds:--2 parts
crumb of stale household bread, 1 part powdered sweet biscuit, 1 part
' Century Food,' 1 part preserved yolk of egg; well mixed together and
slightly damped. A. G. BUTLER.

The two examples now in the Zoological Society's collection which,
I regret to say, are both males, certainly give the choice to blue, as, a few
days back, I cut up a small quantity of bright-coloured cloth, consisting of
red, pink, and two shades of blue, which I scattered round the bower in
the outdoor compartment of their aviary; but, on visiting the place shortly
after, I discovered that they had removed the whole of the blue strips to
a bower they were constructing in the interior compartment of their
domicile, whilst the red and pink remained outside.
Is there any connection between their preference for blue and the
brilliant blue of their eyes, which is a colour seldom found in birds or
mammals except as a sport or in a few domestic species ?

Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Virginian Nightingale, cock (Mrs. C. Fogg-Elliot). [Your bird died of apoplexy. You
do not say on what he was fed, as this may have had something to do with the fit. If
you will send full particulurs of diet I shall be pleased to give you my opinion].
Masked Weaver (Mr. M. E. Griffiths). [Your bird died of pneumonia].
Blood-romped Parrakeet (Mr. F. C. Thorpe). [Your bird was much emaciated, and
died of heart failure].
Diamond Sparrow, hen (Mrs. Connell). [Your bird died of congestion of the liver and
jaundice].
Turtle Dove (Mr. T. H. Newman). [Your bird died of starvation owing to softening of
the bones of the upper and lower mandibles. This was a most interesting case. The
whole of the bones were undergoing softening. The left humerus was fractured.
This is the first case of the kind I have seen. I quite think that had you administered
a regular course of the syrup of phosphates in the early stages you might have
saved your bird].
Green Cardinal (Mr. F. Moerschell). [Your bird died of broncho-pneumonia. There
were evidences on the skull of its previous injuries, but these had nothing to do with
its death. Am very pleased if I have been able to assist you, and appreciate your
kind remarks].
Rufous-tailed Gkassfinch (Mrs. Johnstone). [Your bird died of inflammation of the
bowels. I would certainly take the precaution never to give cold water to birds in a
heated aviary, but let it be at least the same temperature as the aviary. I am pleased
to note you do not give egg food, as this is so frequently blamed. Flowering grass is
a safe form of green food if not given in a very wet or frozen condition. Many
thanks for postal order, 2/6, received. Answered by post].
Sc aley-breasted Lorikeet (Mrs. Johnstone). [Your bird died of apoplexy, there being
a large clot of extravasated blood from a ruptured blood vessel on the brain. The
action of an aperient depends on the extent of the lesion. If the cerebral vessels are
only congested and thus cause pressure the aperient is frequently successful, but if
there has been a ruptured blood vessel and the pressure is caused by extravasated
blood and this extravasation is to any great extent it usually proves fatal in spite
of treatment. Your feeding is good].
Spice-bird (Mr. I,. W. Horton). [Inflammation of liver. Thanks for P. O. 2/6 received.
Answered by post].
Cordon Bleu and Zebra Finch (Miss Furneaux). [Apoplexy was the cause of death in
both cases].
Parson Finch (Mr. T. N. Wilson). [This bird died of inflammation of the oviduct owing
to retention of a ruptured soft-shelled egg. Am obliged for your detailed letter.
You provide a good supply of shell-forming materials, but evidently not in the form
appreciated by the birds. Obtain some old mortar rubbish from a demolished buildiug.

then peck it. If this does not have the desired effect, take two ounces of the pure
mortar and pulverize and mix in a quart of water to be used for drinking purposes
during the afternoon and evening twice or three times a week. I shall be glad to

Indigo Finch (Mr. W. Tomes). [Your bird died of fits caused by reflex nerve irritation
owing to subacute inflammation of the bowels. You give no particulars as to
feeding or I might have been able to suggest the cause of the diseased condition ot
the bowels].
Pied Mynah (The Rev. H. Wilmot). [Your bird died of exhaustion and heart failure. It
was one of those cases in which no disease of the internal organs is discernible, but
there is great waste of tissue due to malassimilation of the food provided. One
frequently finds the presence of parasites in birds and in fact all animals when in
this extremely debilitated condition],
Blue-frontkd Amazon (The Rev. R. H. Wilmot). [Death was due to pressure on the
brain caused by an extensive extravasation of blood on the left side of brain. I am sorry
I cannot say where you could procure Pacozzi, but perhaps some one of our members
can assist you].
Cordon Bleu, hen (The Hon. M. C. Hawke). [Apoplexy caused death].
Eclectus Parrot, hen (Mr. C. P. Arthur). [Your bird died of acute inflammation of the
bowels and liver. My advice is always--endeavour to ascertain the disease and its
cause before attempting treatment. Diarrhoea is sometimes caused by some
irritating material in the bowels. This indicates an aperient, by preference I use
Diuneford's Fluid Magnesia. It may be caused by liver or bowel trouble, and if of
an inflammatory nature aperients would probably increase the trouble. The safest
remedy I have found for this form of diarrhoea (bright green) is precipitated chalk
and ohlorodyne. I had a pair of Eclectus Parrots that were similarly attacked, but I
saved them with the above].
Nightingale (The Hon. Mary C. Hawke). [Your bird died of exhaustion, with heart
failure as a consequence. I am afraid you have fed the bird too highly. You do not
say what grade of Century Food you used. If No. 1, no extra egg was necessary. I
have kept several Nightingales on No. x Century Food moistened with carrot and
boiled potato alternately, and about three mealworms a day. There was extensive
disease of liver, your bird being a victim to indigestion and consequent inability to
assimilate the food, which caused the emaciation].
Virginian Nightingale (Mr. O. E. Cresswell). [There was no trace of poison. The bird
died of apoplexy. There was an extensive blood clot on back part of brain. You
do not say how she was fed : this is the most likely cause].
Bearded Rekdling (Mr. H. L. Sich). [Inflammation of the bowels caused death,
brought on probably from the feeding or chill. If you use No. 1 grade Century Food
as directed you do not require hemp or maw seed. This food is of such high
nutritive quality that if given as directed nothing else is necessary. I have a great
opinion as to the value of it as a food for birds in captivity. Answered by post.
Mauv thanks for postal order, 2/6].

BIRDS OF TENNYSON,
BY
WATKIN WATKINS, B.A.Cantab.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9601205" page_id="32958937"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on 1 The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's 'note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of 'The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E- Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

THE BAHAMA AMAZON PARROT.
Chrysotis bahamensis.
Sy J. Lewis Bonhote, M.A.
Several of the West Indian species of Chrysotis have
already been figured in our Magazine, but as the majority of
them are now becoming so scarce that their extinction can only
be a matter of a few more years, I feel that no excuse is
necessary for bringing to the notice of members a bird, which,
apart from its beautiful coloration, has but little to recom-
mend it.
This species was originally described by Dr. Bryant
(Proc. Bost. Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. VI. p. 65 1866), who recognised
it as distinct from the Cuban species (C. leucocephala ) which is
its nearest ally, but owing to lack of specimens (I doubt whether
there are any in Europe except those I brought over alive)
naturalists have hesitated before accepting it as specially
different from the Cuban Parrot of which however there can be
no doubt.
With Mr. Goodchild's plate in front of us a description of
this bird is unnecessary, and we need therefore only note the
points in which it differs from C. leucocephala.
The Cuban species differs from its Bahama relative in
having the belly deep crimson and showing red on every tail
feather except the two central ones, whereas in the Bahama

<bodyText confidence="0.998660135135135" page_id="32958942"  page_num="Page 240" year="" vol="">
Mr. J. L. Bonhote,
bird the belly is entirely green occasionally showing a few
isolated red feathers, and the tail is also entirely green showing
red only on the two outer feathers. In addition to this the
Bahama bird is slightly larger and its colours are rather
brighter and more vivid.
Without going too minutely into details it may be stated
that ten species of Chrysotis are still to be found in the West
Indies, and of these four have already been figured in our
Magazine, viz.: C. botiqueti, Vol. VII., p. 109; C. augusta, Vol.
VIII., p. 157 ; C. versicolor , Vol. VIII., p. 275 ; and C. guildingi,
N.S., Vol. II., p. 151.
The remaining species are C. sallcei, from San Domingo;
C. vittata, from Porto Rica ; C. collaria and C. agilis, from
Jamaica; and C. leucocephala , from Cuba.
In Jamaica and Dominica we find two species, but all the
rest of the islands contain but one, and with the exception of
august a and guildmgi they are all forms and varieties, though
well-marked and distinct of the white-fronted Amazon.
The Bahama Amazon seems to have a great disinclination
for flying, and even when in an aviary with full use of its wings
it always prefers climbing. Presumably it is for this reason
that we find these birds differentiated from their allies in
islands but a few miles apart and although once widely spread
throughout the Bahamas it is now restricted to one, or possibly
two of the islands from which it is never known to wander.
To my way of thinking there is only one satisfactory
method of keeping Parrots, and that is to allow them to roam at
will round a West Indian garden. Two that I brought over
spent six months in that manner and were a delight to the eye as
they climbed about among the thick foliage of the Bougainer
Uia or sat preening themselves near the blossoms of the pink
oleander, while I even learnt to appreciate (at a distance) the
matutinal screams with which they welcomed the rising sun. As
soon as they heard the clatter of plates denoting a meal they
would solemnly stalk into the dining room, climb on to the
back of a chair and worry their nearest neighbour until they

received their meal of bread, potato, or banana after which they
would retire to the garden and patiently await their next meal.
This was their only food and on it they seemed to thrive.
When spring came round and the sapodillas began to open they
betook themselves to the sapodilla tree and wrought untold
havoc amongst the fruit, throwing down what they had no use
for. They were a pair and would probably have bred and seen
their children's children still on that same tree (for they are by
nature most stay at home and lazy) but their free career was
suddenly cut short and they were transported many miles to
their present home near Cambridge.
They stood the journey well and have never had a day's
illness ; during the winter they are kept indoors in separate
cages, but in summer time they are turned into an open aviary
in the hopes that they may be induced to breed, but so far
without success.
They are very noisy, especially during the summer, sunrise
aud sunset being their most noisy periods, but unfortunately
they are not over particular and may be heard within a quarter
of a mile radius during any of the hours of daylight. They are
not great talkers, although if time and trouble were devoted to
them they might prove fairly good pupils, as they most easily
pick up sounds, especially whistles, sneezing, etc., while their
great tour de force is an imitation of a hen being caught and
having its neck wrung, a common sound in the Bahamas, where
poultry is always bought alive and killed just before it is required
for the pot. I am glad to say that they are now wearying of this
imitation, but for many months after my return to England I
felt like a murderer pursued by the dying shrieks of his victim.

NOTES ON MELANISM. AND ALBINISM IN BIRDS.
By A. G. Butler, Pli.D.

In a paper published in 1889 ( Proc. Zool. Soc. pp. 282-7)
" On a New Genus of Fossil Moths from the Eocene Freshwater
Limestone of Gurnet Bay, Isle of Wight," I discussed the
question as to the development of colour in Lepidopterous
Insects, and the probability that (all forms presumably being
originally either white or black, or a combination of these two
hues), there was strong evidence to show that the first bright
colours produced were blue from black, and yellow from
white.
Furthermore, I argued that white indicated delicacy of
constitution if acquired by reversion, a wild white primrose
which I planted in my garden in the hope of multiplying this
sport, having produced 110 seed, and having died after division
of the root.
Again, in a paper published in ''The Zoologist" for 1902
I made the following remarks respecting albinism in birds (p.
252):--
" There is no doubt that albinism in birds is due to con-
stitutional weakness, and is a frequent result of close inbreeding.
If a pair of Sparrows (Passer domesticus) takes up its quarters in
one part of a building, or in the roof of an isolated cottage, the
young, inbreeding for successive generations, are pretty certain
to throw individuals with more or less white in the plumage.
The White Dove (popularly known as 'White Java') is known
to be merely the albino form of the Collared Turtle (Turtur
risorius), and Mr. Abrahams assured me that it could always be
produced by close inbreeding from the common type. It is
probable that inbreeding first produced the pied Java Sparrows,
from which the Chinese, by careful selection, evolved the
white variety of that species. White in the plumage of birds
is frequently due to old age, and increases year by year. A
Chaffinch which Iliad for about fifteen years acquired quite white
eyelids before its death, and a Cordon-bleu (Estrilda phoenicotis),
now in my possession, began to acquire a white wing-speculum
some three or four years ago ; this has now become a large white

patch. A pied Chaffinch, which I once caught in the garden,
became much whiter at the two succeeding moults ; and a pied
Blackbird sent to me a year or more ago showed an increase of
white after its autumn moult; both were delicate birds, and did
not live long, so that I conclude they were probably inbred."
The pied Cordon-bleu above referred to died on Jan. 7th
1903 and I sent it to the Natural History Museum : oddly
enough an exactly similar example was sent to me a few days
later by one of the readers of " The Feathered World." My
specimen of this delicate little finch had been in my possession
about seven years.
In a letter to " The Ibis " in 1902, pp. 674-6, describing an
abnormal but very beautiful example of melauochroism in a
Gouldian Finch, I pointed out the fact that exceptionally vigorous
birds sometimes became quite black in old age, and I recorded the
case of a Song-Thrush which was seventeen years old when it
died, and had been in captivity sixteen years : this bird was
crippled with age and quite black. Similar instances occur in
the case of the Skylark. I ask the question in that letter,--" Is
melanochroism in old age the result of unusual constitutional
vigour, as leucochroism seems to be of constitutional weak-
ness?" This I am now convinced must be the case.
In his article " On the Comparative Ages to which Birds
live " (Ibis 1899, p. 25) Mr. J. H. Gurney observes--" this
incipient albinism is not directly due to age, but to the artificial
conditions under which all birds are placed in captivity," a con-
clusion to which I think all owners of tolerably large aviaries
must demur, the conditions in many aviaries being only so far
artificial as they eliminate the causes which are liable to shorten
the lives of the more delicate birds.
In like manner, a well-known ornithologist spoke to me
recently of the extraordinary effect which captivity produces in
some of the Weavers when kept in aviaries, causing them to
become entirely black ; and he argued that, as these melanistic
forms were never shot in the wild state, they must have been
produced by unnatural food. %
If this were the true explanation of melanism in birds, it

Dr. A. G. Butler,
would be difficult to explain why all the birds of the same
species when kept together and similarly fed, should not be
similarly affected. It has indeed been asserted (and for some
years I believed the assertion), that a Bullfinch, if fed largely
upon hemp, would become black; but on my speaking to a
judge at one of our large shows as to the right of a black Bull-
finch to a prize in the class for rare-feathered birds, he assured
me that hemp had nothing to do with the colour ; and when I
reflected that I had once been cautioned against giving hemp to
Cardinals, because it dulls the colouring," an assertion which
I had amply disproved by invariably giving it to several
species for many years, I was convinced that hemp did not
necessarily affect the colour of Bullfinches.
If melanism w r ere due to unnatural conditions apart from
vigour of constitution, albinism might also be the result of
artificial conditions apart from delicacy of constitution ; but, in
that case, it should surely have a similar effect upon all members
of a species.
I think it will be admitted that, as examples of vigorous
aviary birds, the Java Sparrow and the Martinican Dove rank
fairly high. At the approach of the breeding-season the vitality
of birds should certainly be at its highest; just as, at the
moulting-season it is most heavily taxed. Now, we know that
when ready to breed, male birds are very aggressive, and think
nothing of plucking out one another's feathers : when these are
replaced, the bird being in its fullest vigour, they should be
expected to be more full of colour than if produced after an
ordinary moult; is this the case? When Java Sparrows fight
they attack their antagonists' heads, and the white cheeks being
most conspicuous are sometimes wholly denuded of feathers :
when this occurs the feathers are subsequently replaced, but are
wholly black instead of white (Vide Bartlett, "Monograph of
the Weaver-birds, etc.," plate II. of Munia oryzivora ): I have a
skin of this variety produced in my bird-room, and the late
Mr. Abrahams assured me that he had seen other examples all
produced in the same manner. In the case of the Java-Sparrow,
however, if the bird survives until the next moult, the white
cheeks are renewed, the reproductive energy not being then

concentrated upon one part of the plumage, but generally
distributed.
I purchased two pairs of Zenaida aurita in May 1898 ; one
hen of which (in spite of the incessant quarrels for which this
troublesome dove is notorious) is still in good health. For
several years I kept the Martinican doves with white Barbary
doves in an outdoor aviary; but after the death of the second
cock bird during the past winter, the solitary hen was so hunted
from pillar to post that I brought her indoors, placing her in one
of my covered aviaries in which were several white doves ; the
latter and a Necklaced Dove carried on the persecution until
every feather had been removed from the lower back and rump of
the Zenaida : these have now all been replaced by black feathers.
Melanism is not found in the species of Pyromelana , and
one or two other Weavers, in a wild state, because they do
not live to the same age as they do when watched over by
experienced aviculturists : with albinism however the case is
different. Quelea russi which is an albinistic form of Q. quelea is
common both wild and in captivity; but then it is the product
of delicacy of constitution, and may result both from inbreed-
ing and the decline of strength due to senility.
In my article in 'The Ibis' for 1897--" On changes of
plumage in some of the typical Weaver-birds " pp. 359-361, I
recorded the fact that a Red-billed Weaver purchased in 1888
assumed the colouring of Russ' Weaver in 1896, and died in that
plumage the year following. This j^ear I have a second and
even more interesting instance in one of my aviaries, a male
Quelea quelea having developed an intermediate plumage, in
which the cheeks alone remain black, whereas a second example
in the same aviary and purchased at the same time, retains the
full black mask of the Red-billed Weaver. If food had anything
to do with the change, both males ought to have been similarly
affected.

Mention has been made in this journal, on more than one
occasion, of the collection of rare birds imported privately some
time ago for our member, Mrs. Johnstone, many of the species
of which she obtained living representatives being entirely new
to European aviculture. Amongst these there were at least
three Parrots, namely Everett's Parrakeet ( Tanygnathus everetti),
the Philippine Racket-tail ( [Prioniturus discurus ) and the subject
of the present notice.
Psitteuteles weberi.
I had some considerable correspondence with Mrs.
Johnstone about a green Lorikeet which was living in her
aviary and formed a close friendship with a female Perfect
Lorikeet ( Psitteuteles euteles ), another very rare species, though

not quite new to aviculture. The unknown bird was very
carefully described to me, but I could make nothing of it, as
no bird in the National Collection agreed with the descrip-
tion, though it was not very unlike Trickoglossus hcsmatodes.
Description having failed to enable me to identify the bird,
Mrs. Johnstone went to the trouble of preparing a water-colour
sketch, but even this did not help me much in my endeavours
to find out what it actually was, though I was still inclined to
think it might be T. hcematodes, possibly immature as it possessed
too little blue on the face for the adult of that species. At
length, one morning the bird was discovered dead, and the body
kindly forwarded to me. I immediately had the skin prepared,
and took it to the British Museum, where however I found
nothing whatever like it, and concluded that it must either be a
species described since the Catalogue oj Birds was published
(1891), or a species entirely new to science. I may remark here
that it was said to have come from Macassar, Celebes ; but if so
it must, I think, have reached there by human aid, as the species
which I have since discovered that it belongs to, is not known to
occur there.
There are one or two species mentioned in the Hand List
of Birds that have been described since the Catalogue was
written, and by looking up the references I soon discovered Mrs.
Johnstone's bird to belong to one of these, namely Psitteuteles
weberi from Flores, a species described by Biittikofer in 1894, in
Max Weber's Zoologische Ergebnisse einer Reise in Niederldndisch
Ost-Indien , and beautifully figured by Keulemaus.
In the Novitates Zoolo^icce for 1898 (Vol. V. p. 43) Mr.
Hartert writes of Psitteuteles weberi: "Of this excellent species,
hitherto only represented by the specimens in the Leyden
Museum, Mr* Everett has sent a fine series from Endeh and
from Mangarai, from the lowlands up to 4,000 feet above the sea.
The specimens agree perfectly with Buttikofer's description and
figure.The much larger bill, the green head with
bluish forehead in the old bird, the yellowish collar on the hind-
neck, and the wide yellowish band across the chest distinguish
P. weberi at a glance from P. euteles.&quot;

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
did not recognise P. weberi as a distinct species, but considered
it merely a variety of P. mteles. but this is accounted for by
the fact that the British Museum, whence Dr. Mivart obtained
most of the material for his book, has never contained a single
specimen of the true P. weberi, though the two species are
admirably figured in Max Weber's journal, above referred to,
to which Dr. Mivart had access.
Mrs. Johnstone has very kindly supplied me with the
following notes for the Avicultural Magazine on her living
specimen of this rare and interesting bird :
" A new Lorikeet, new at least to me, came into my
possession early in January of this year. It was a lively and
interesting bird and reminded me much of the Blue Mountain
Lorikeet, having the same lively manner and quick alert move-
ments. The colouring was a harmony in green : blue-green
head, leaf-green back, and yellow-green bar across the breast
and nape of the neck. The eye was ruby colour and the beak
a coral red.
" The new arrival made great advances to a hen Perfect
Lorikeet (Psitteideles euteles), a modest retiring little creature.
She was always to be found close to him, and he always shared
with her any good thing that came his way in the shape of a
sweet water grape or a piece of banana. He performed the
curious love dance which is peculiar to most of the Lorikeets.
He very rarely screamed, in fact his note was not unpleasant
unless alarmed, when it became unpleasantly shrill.
" I fed him, as I feed all my Lorikeets, on powdered
biscuit (fancy lunch) moistened with sweetened boiled milk,
made fresh every morning, and a piece of banana or orange or
sweet water grape; I believe he also ate a few canary seeds.
" I kept them in a cage for some time and then, thinking
the exercise would be beneficial, turned them loose in a large
indoor aviary. But alas! one morning I missed him, and when
examining a hollow tree-trunk put to induce a pair of Black-cap
Lories to nest, I found him at the bottom--dead: he had
probably climbed in and been unable to get out.
" I sent him at once to Mr. Seth-Smith who pronounced

him to be Weber's Lorikeet--a very rare species--so liis un-
timely death was most regrettable."
The present species seems to demonstrate the absurdity
of separating the Green Lorikeets (. Psitteuteles ) from the genus
Tnchoglossics, the members of which possess more or less red on
the plumage, for surely colour alone should not be sufficient
ground for the creation of a distinct genus! In comparing
Psitteideles weberi with Trichoglossus ?iovcs-hollandicz, the well-
known Blue-Mountain, or Swainson's Lorikeet, we find the
arrangements of the plumage to be almost identical, though ot
course the colours are different. On the nape we find the same
yellowish band ; on the breast the same large patch (red and
yellow in Swainson's and greenish yellow in Weber's) the same
patch on the abdomen (purple in Swainson's and dark green in
Weber's). Turning to the wings we find the very same yellow
patches on the inner webs of the primaries in both species. P.
weberi has the same shaft-streaks on the head as T. novce-hollandice ,
but in the former the feathers are green, and in the latter blue.
Moreover the habits and actions of the one are identical with
those of the other, and yet they are considered by the cabinet
ornithologists to belong to different genera !
In Biittikofer's original description (which is in German),
he tells us that P. weberi is the representative in Flores of the
species in Timor known as P. euteles Teintn., but is always
easily distinguished from the latter by its distinctly larger bill,
dark grass-green head (olive-yellow in P. euteles ) with blue
feathers on the forehead, the broad greenish-yellow breast-band
which is quite distinct from the grass-green throat and grass-
green abdomen, as well as by the colour of the underside of the
tail feathers which nearly approaches olive-brown, those of P.
euteles having a strong inclination towards olive-yellow. He
points out that the immature P. euteles has the head also green,
but brighter than that of P. weberi , and without the blue
feathers on the forehead which characterize the latter species.
The following is a description of the adult Psitteuteles
weberi :--Head, sides of neck and throat grass-green, each
feather with a brighter green shaft-streak; the feathers on the
forehead with bright blue tips ; a distinct greenish-yellow collar

on the back of the neck ; the whole of the breast bright greenish-
yellow, the feathers being mostly edged with green, and in the
specimen before me (though this is not mentioned in Buttikofer's
description) many of the feathers have distinct orange bands; the
whole of the back, upper side of wings and tail grass-green ; the
quills black with their outer webs grass-green, with the exception
of the outermost which is entirely black ; abdomen and under
tail coverts dark grass-green, more or less mixed with yellow,
especially on the sides of the abdomen ; under wing-coverts
greenish yellow ; underside of wings black, with a long yellow
patch on the inner web of each of the primaries, except the
first, forming a broad cross-band when the wings are extended;
underside of tail olive-green, with a strong inclination towards
olive-brown. Bill and irides orange-red ; feet lead colour. Total
length about nine inches.
Mrs. Johnstone's specimen, from which the above des-
cription is taken, proved to be a male by dissection, but the
sexes are said not to differ in plumage.
I need not, I think, apologise for having occupied so much
valuable space over this very rare bird, and I would add that Mrs.
Johnstone is to be heartily congratulated on having obtained a
live example of the species, and kept it for some months in her
aviary. I have thought it worth while to have a line drawing
made to accompany this article, though colours are really
necessary to do it justice.

A specimen of the Boat-billed Night-Heron, received on
April 1st, is a very interesting addition to the collection, and the
only one of its kind owned by the Zoological Society since 1883,
before which year however some nine or ten examples had lived
in the Gardens at various times. It is a native of Tropical
America, and the only species of the genus Cancroma. " It
seems," writes Professor Newton, " to be merely a Night-Heron
(.Nycticorax ) with an exaggerated bill, so much widened as to
suggest its English name, and its habits, so far as they are
known, confirm the inference derived from its structure."
A fine example of the Alexandra or Princess of
Wales' Parrakeet, presented to the Society by Mrs. St. Clair
Christophers, is a very valuable addition. The species was
figured in Volume V. (Sept. 1899) of this Magazine, and is also
referred to elsewhere in the present issue. It is closely allied
to the Barraband and Rock Pepler or Black-tailed Parrakeet,
though it differs from these in the possession of a curious
feature in the formation of the third primary feather, which has
given rise to the adoption of the generic term Spathopterus
(see Parrakeets, page 126).

252 Bird Notes from the Zoological Gardens.
The Yellow-vented Parrakeets in the above list are, of
course, ordinary " Blue-bonnets," though by some extraordinary
error, they are marked in the official list of additions as new to
the collection. This is doubtless accounted for by the fact that
this species and its near relative the Red-vented Parrakeet
{Psephotus hcematorrhous ) were, at one time, not recognised as
distinct species, both being termed Psephotus hczmatogaster, a
name that appears frequently in former editions of the List of
Vertebrated Animals. Hence, when these birds were deposited
under the correct name of P. xanthorrhous they were entered as
" new to the collection," as this name did not occur in the
Society's list. As every aviculturist who has studied Parrakeets
knows, the Red-vented species is the rare form, and the Yellow-
vented the ordinary one. So uncommon in fact is the Red-vented
Blue-bonnet that our great authority on Parrots, the esteemed
President of this Society, remarked, in his review of Parrakeets ,
that he did not know that such a bird existed. It is hardly
likely then that all the " Blue - bonnets " that the Zoological
Society has owned have belonged to this rare form.
While on this subject, I might mention that I recently
examined a good series of skins of "Blue-bonnet" Parrakeets,
and was struck by the way in which the two forms intergrade,
it being very difficult to say to which some of the specimens
belonged.
I have already pointed out in &amp;apos;Parrakeets (page 196) how
greatly the Blue-bonnets differ in habits from the other species
of Psephotus , and my strong opinion that they are worthy of
generic distinction. The two forms are figured in colours in the
work just referred to.
Thanks to a very genial spring, most of the Parrots in the
new Flying aviary appear to be doing very well, though the
vegetation is rapidly vanishing. The Quakers have made a
beautiful nest of sticks, which is well worth a special journey to
see, and both Leadbeaters and Rosy Cockatoos appear to be
nesting in some artificial logs that have been provided for
their use.
A pair of Laughing Kingfishers have a nest and the
female is sitting well in the Great Aviary. D. S.-S.

Sir, -- I should be very grateful for advice as to how to treat a Blue-
fronted Amazon Parrot, which appears to be in rather a bad way.
This bird is afflicted with what appears to be a tumour on the back of
its head. I noticed it some months ago, and helped its owner to remove
a large quantity of hardened matter which had formed a kind of core at
the back of the bird's head. When this was taken away it left a hard lump
with a raw surface which gradually callused over. Now this tumour or
growth is much larger, and has quite spoiled the bird's appearance, as it
forms a large and very unsightly lump sticking up through the feathers.
Is there any way of treating it or of removing it without killing the
patient ?
The bird looks rather " rough," and is a very small specimen, but I
am bound to say it does not seem to suffer in any way and its appetite is
good. It is rather inclined to scratch the place, but does not do so
violently. It is fed on the usual Parrot mixture and a little sopped bread.
I have never seen such a growth before, but am told that Parrots are
rather subject to it, so perhaps there is a recognised treatment for it among
bird fanciers. I should be most grateful for any advice.
E. F. Chawner.
The following reply has been sent to Miss Chawner:
With regard to the swelling 011 the Parrot's head, it would be
necessary to examine it before an opinion could be given. If the tumour
is easily moved under the skin and not attached to the structures beneath,
excision would undoubtedly be the correct treatment; but should it be
firmly attached to the adjacent structures, its location and the structures
involved would necessarily determine the advisablity of an operation.
Should you care to send the bird to me for examination I shall be pleased
to advise you.
Your bird is evidently out of health--from your description " rather
rough." Why don't you follow Dr. Butler's directions as to feeding ?
From experience I can strongly recommend them.
Arthur Giee.
RED-FACED LOVE-BIRDS.
Sir, --On the 22nd of April I received trom a dealer an apparently
healthy bird of this species in good bright plumage, except that the flight
feathers of one wing had been cut as is customary. I directed the aviary
keeper to draw the stumps and keep the bird in a cage in his house until

the new feathers had grown and the weather had become more favourable
for putting it into the aviary. On the 30th April it was dead, having in the
meantime lost every body feather.
Ou the 4th Ma}&amp;apos; instant I received auother from the same dealer, also
in good plumage and looking bright, except that it displayed a disposition
to "hide its head under its wing" like the Robin in the nursery song. I
determined to keep this one at home under my own eye. I drew out the
stump quills from the wing, which seemed to cause very little pain, put the
bird into a roomy box cage an^. kept it in our sitting-room, where we have
kept a Grey-headed Love-bird in perfect health for a year. I fed it on
white millet, spray millet, and canary seed, the last being well and freely
eaten. On the morning of the Sth I noticed the bird rolling and shivering,
in the afternoon it began with convulsions, in the evening it died
after much struggling and beating of the wings. This is not my first
experience of the kind with these birds, and I am almost afraid to buy
them, though they are very attractive birds when once established.
Chas. L. Rothera.
[The late Mr. Abrahams once told me that the only way to remove
the stumps of the quills without injuring the bird was to take out not more
than one or two at a time, repeating the operation about once a week until
all were removed. Red-faced Love-birds, although they have been known
to aviculturists from a very remote period, are by no means fully under-
stood, and we should welcome a discussion of their treatment in this
journal.--E d.]

BIRDS OF CUBA AND JAMAICA.

Sir,--I promised to send you a few notes ou Cuban birds, but the
notes on Cuban birds will be scanty this time, as I have only spent seven-
teen days in Cuba (Province of Santiago de Cuba), and again, Cuban birds
are very scarce or perhaps shy. The only Cuban birds I have seen wild are
the Cuban Nightingale--a species of Mocking Bird often kept in cages In
the Cuban towns--the Nonpareil, Indigo, also a bird about the shape and
size of a Java Sparrow--a fine blue-black with a white spot on throat, the
Olive-tliroated Finch, and a bird shaped like a Sugar Bird, though double
the size, plumage dark green, bill black, long and curved.
My observations 011 Jamaican birds are a little more extended. Up in
the Blue Mountains I heard Parrots, but did not see them. I also saw a
very tiny Humming Bird with a dark green back, head, and wings, and a
pale yellowish green underneath. This species seems peculiar to the
higher parts of Jamaica. I have also seen it in the Clarendon Hills, Santa
Cruce Mountains, and Mocha Mountains, they are abundant from Catadupa
down to Porus. Native Canaries are also common in the higher parts of the
country : this bird is a Quit I fancy, a bright greenish yellow, rather darker

on the wings. At May Pen, where I am living, bird life is abundant. First,
Johnny Crow, which every bird from the Hummer up goes for. Riding in
the Mocha Mountains one day, I saw a Loggerhead attack a Crow which
was sitting on a dead tree. The attack was so strong that the Crow flew
down just under the nose of my horse. After riding past a few yards, I
stopped, and again the Loggerhead attacked the Crow, which never
attempted to defend himself, and the last I saw as I rode on was the Crow
with its head packed away under its wing and the Loggerhead charging it
from every side. I am told by the blacks that it is a most difficult thing to
find a Crow's nest, and not a very desirable " find," as the stench is awful.
I am told the young Crows are covered with white down.
There is a pair of Humming Birds nesting in a large guango tree in
front of mj&amp;apos; bungalow, and no other bird has any right in either the guango
or yet a large bread fruit tree near by, the large leaves of the latter furnish
a shelter for the Hummer during a tropical shower. The male bird is a
beauty about the size of a Gouldian Finch, head dark green, wings
brownish green, under parts a splendid metallic green, which shows up
splendidly in the sun as the bird flying about sucks the scarlet hibiscus
flowers. This bird has two fine long tail feathers which extend past the
real tail about seven inches. The bill is bright scarlet. He is absolutely
fearless, and when I am sitting on the piazza flies alongside me to search the
flowers within a foot of where I am sitting. He drinks in the early morn-
ing by sipping the dew, and should we have a shower of rain he extends his
wings and flutters them as he sits on a branch of a guava--a favourite tree
of his--and sips the rain drops from the leaves.
The Jamaican Blackbird or Tick Bird is common in all pastures and
woods. Cat-bird would be a good name for this bird as it makes a mewing
noise. In the logwood bush there is a species of creeper beautifully marked
with fine white and black marks all over. In the logwood bush I have seen
most of the Quits, also the Greeu-body-bird or, as the Jamaicans call it, the
Robin-red-breast (a beautiful little bird with a very peculiar call), the Old-
man or Rain-bird, Banana, Blue and Orange Quits, also Grass and Beam
Quits, the latter are more common in higher lands.
Ringtail, Blue and Bald-pate Pigeons are common along mountain
streams, and the Ground-Dove is seen everywhere on the plains. I am told
they are on the increase, having taken to nesting in trees, and so get out of
the way of the Mongoose, the last-named animal, I am told, is on the
decrease owing to the grass lice and ticks.
Nearly all the Jamaican birds are protected by the Government, so
one has not much chance of making any close examination of the different
birds, but nearly all the Jamaican birds are tame and fearless, and with a
little care one gets within easy distance--a pair of field glasses also come
in useful.

The Illustration Fund.
A pair of Beam Quits are nesting right under my sitting-room
window in a thick wild fern, the nest is composed of grass and wild cotton,
and contains at present one egg, pale blue with irregular brown spots--
rather thickly spotted at larger end. The nest is poorly built and very
fragile, in the shape of a ball with a small hole on the lower side, if the
tropical rain does not wash it away it will be a wonder.
There is a large fustic tree a few yards away from my house covered
with mistletoe (very much like the English plant) and flocks of Quits and
Canaries visit the tree every evening for the purpose of making their
supper off the insects and berries.
More next time and perhaps of Cuba, for I shall visit that island
twice before I reach England again.

Onr Member, Mr. W. Fasey, whose collection of Parrakeets is
certainly the finest private collection in Great Britain, has just had the
very good fortune to secure a pair each of Alexandra or Princess of Wales'
and Bourke's Parrakeets, which, through the courtesy of their owner the
present writer has had the pleasure of inspecting. All four birds are very
fine specimens, and it is sincerely to be hoped that they will not only live
long, but will breed in Mr. Fasey's aviaries. Bourke's Parrakeet [Neophema
bourkei) is one of the most delicately coloured and one of the rarest of the
Grass-Parrakeets, the most conspicuous tints being salmon pink, pale blue,
and brown. Mr. Fasey's birds are probably the only living specimens that
have been seen in this country for fifteen or twenty years. There is a record
of } r oung having been hatched in an aviary in Camden Town many years
ago, but they were not reared. D. S.-S.

Post Mortem Examinations.
Two Red-faced Love-birds (Mr. C. L. Rothera). [No. i was no doubt
considerably debilitated by the very rapid moult. It died of acute
congestion of the lungs. Either chill or gassy atmosphere would
certainly produce the condition. I cannot agree with } T our opinion of
typhoid. Neither of your birds suffered from this disease. No. 2
died of peritonitis. I have had considerable experience with young
Gre}' Parrots and one year succeeded in rearing 27 out of 28. The
one died of enteritis caused by swallowing the galvanizing material
which it picked off the bars of a new cage I put it in. Red-faced
Love-birds are acknowledged very delicate birds. Given equal
numbers of Grey Parrots and Red-faced Love-birds I would undertake
to rear from 50 to 75 per cent, more of the former than the latter if j
could have the choosing of the birds. Grey Parrots when bought
healthy are in my opinion fairly hardy birds.]
Si&amp;apos;. Heeena Waxbiee (Mrs. E. Mellor). [Bird died of concussion of the
brain. Have you any mice ? They may frighten the birds and make
them fly against the wires.]
Cordon Bleu (Miss Woods). [Bird died of concussion of the brain. It is
quite possible the Cardinals are the culprits. Please read rules re

Zebra Finch (The Lady Adelaide Dawnay). [The symptons described were
caused b}' brain pressure. There was some extravasated blood ou the
right and posterior part of the brain.]
Beack-headed Gouedian Hen (Mr. W. H. St. Quintin). [The ailment
was a form of so-called " French moult." 1 should not have drawn
the quills as it was evident the system was unable to produce sufficient
feather-forming element. I should have applied an ointment of
Cliinosol 3 grains, Lanoline 2 drachms, and given 3 drops of Parrish's
Syrup of Phosphates to ^-an-ounce of water to drink. Renewing

" Many as are the volumes which have been written oil different phases and aspects
of our late laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that 'No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's-' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Rovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of 'The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkiu Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton- Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Bodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

By E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
A very charming, and in my opinion successful, form of
aviculture, may be practised by almost anyone, provided he
does not live in the heart of a town, by placing suitable and
convenient nesting boxes for our hole - breeding birds, and
choosing sites that are likely to be suitable to the species of
bird that it is desirable to attract.
No doubt various shapes and makes of boxes are suitable,
and I have seen some very nice boxes made in Germany from
hollowed out birch trunks, with moveable lids and perches
outside the hole ; but the boxes we use, and which are almost
always occupied year after year, are made by our own carpenter
out of f-inch oak plank for small birds, and i-inch plank for
large birds. Those for small birds are usually five to six inches
square inside, eight to nine inches deep, with a lid fastened by a
leather hinge, the lid sloping and slightly projecting over the
hole, which should be near the top of the box, at the side or in
front; it does not matter which. The hole should be round and
ijin. to i#in. diameter. And I find an admirable way to attract
Tits, Nuthatches, Wrynecks, etc., is to nail a piece of stout bark
across the hole, so as to make the opening too small for any bird ;
and then the incoming tenant chips the bark away to the size
required. This has the effect of keeping out House Sparrows ;
but boxes placed low and away from houses and out-buildings,
are not much troubled by these "undesirables." Almost any

position will do, provided it is not too high up, (about 5ft. is the
best height) and not fully exposed to the South-West wind,
shelter from any high wind is most desirable. I find the
positions near roads or walks are more attractive than very
secluded sites, and that Wrynecks prefer fairly open situations,
and also rather deep boxes, ten inches to one foot from the hole
to the bottom of the box, which should have a little dry rotten
\0x25A0wood in it; but if they take to a box which has already been
appropriated by a Tit, they will speedily destroy the nest and
clean out the box to their liking. * Nuthatches will take to
almost any box--even those with large holes which are suitable
for Starlings--as they close the hole with mud to fit it to them-
selves. When they choose a box with a small hole they use
mud just the same, fastening down the lid and plastering the
inside round the hole and making the hole to exactly fit their
bodies.
Some years the Great Tit breeds in the boxes almost to the
exclusion of all other species, fully 80 per cent, of Tit boxes
being taken by them. In other years the Blue Tit takes its place.
Some Coal Tits breed in boxes every year, but the Marsh Tit
rarely does so. I don't think I have had as many as twenty
Marsh Tits nest in boxes in as many years : they nest in the
ground or in rotten stumps. Boxes made with very wide
openings, and shallow, are often taken to by Wagtails, Robins,
and Flycatchers.
All boxes should be fixed firvily to the trunk of the tree or
a wall with two nails, so that they do not twist or vibrate in any
way. The occupants do not mind being looked at in the least,
and you can open the lid and look at the sitting bird without the
fear of it forsaking. While they are laying, all the Tits cover their
eggs with nesting material, but as soon as incubation commences
leave them exposed when they leave the nest. The Nuthatch
however covers her eggs on all occasions. I often find my small
boxes inhabited by mice, dormice, and even bats ! Boxes should
have the old nests taken out of them as soon as the young have
flown, and, when possible, I often look at them in the early
spring, to clear out anything that may have accumulated
during the winter. When made of oak these boxes will last for

very many years. We have some large boxes that have been up
for over 30 years, and are still quite sound, and have been
occupied this season.
For large birds such as Owls, Kestrels, etc., I generally
have them 15 inches square, inside measurement, with double
span roof, with fairly wide eaves over the sides and projecting
over the hole in front. The hole should be 3^in. by 4^in., be
placed in the upper part of the box, and have a ledge for the
birds to perch on, such as you see in Pigeon cotes. I have no
projecting eaves at the back, as that goes against the trunk of
the tree. Various sites are suitable, but avoid having the hole
facing into the S.W. I usually place mine from 15ft. to 25ft. up,
on a stout horizontal bough, and with the back of the box
against the trunk of the tree. When these boxes are first put
up a few handfulls of dry rotten wood are usually placed in it,
just sufficient to prevent the eggs from rolling about. This,
however, is really hardly necessary, as, with the exception of
Owls and Kestrels, all birds who use them convey nesting
materials, and any boxes put up in the autumn are almost sure
to be occupied by squirrels during the winter. Jackdaws are the
greatest enemies to nests in large boxes ; they fill them with
sticks and are every way very objectionable ; but they do not
usually take to boxes when placed in woods, or when far from
dwellings. Barn Owls in time will fill the box they occupy with
castings up to the hole, and they want clearing out every three or
four years. But boxes occupied by the Brown Owl will always be
found to be quite clean, and practically no castings in them.
Almost every box will be occupied by Stock Doves in late summer
and autumn, with the exception of those taken by Barn Owls,
who breed very late and whose young remain in the nest, often
until the end of October. A few holes bored in the bottom
assist in draining the boxes. The birds that usually resort to
large boxes are Barn and Brown Owls, Kestrels, Stock Doves,
and Jackdaws; and they are also much res;orted to in winter by
squirrels, young of which I have repeatedly found in them very
early in the year.
On one occasion I found seven young stoats in one of
these boxes, about 25 feet up in a beech tree ! The attraction of

suitable boxes in inducing birds to breed in one's neighbour-
hood is quite remarkable. For even with almost unlimited
natural sites nearly every box will be occupied. They give also
opportunities for observing the nesting habits of hole-breeding
species which could hardly be otherwise obtained.
At one time I used to provide numbers of nesting boxes
for Starlings, not for their sakes however, but with the intention
perhaps of relieving the Woodpeckers, whose every hole used
to be appropriated by these pests as soon as completed.
Now however I have given it up, as the enormous numbers of
the Starling make it impossible to suppty sufficient boxes, and
also the Green Woodpecker is beginning to assert itself. I have
seen two or three cases this season in which the Green Wood-
pecker has resented the attacks of numerous pairs of Starlings.
Owing to the kindness of our Editor, Mr. Seth-Smith, I
am enabled to show some charming pictures of some boxes in
situ. Fig. i represents an oak box that was put up in 1872 ; it is
perfectly sound and good, and has been occupied by Tawny Owls
on an average every other year. It has occasionally had Barn
Owls in it, but when taken to by Tawny Owls the latter come so
much earlier that they keep the Barn Owls out. This box is larger
than those I usually put up now, being 18 inches square inside
and 2 feet high, and is quite unnecessarily large, as I find the
smaller boxes of 15 inches square quite as popular.
Fig. 2 shows a box occupied this year by a pair of Nut-
hatches, and the mud that is plastered in the hole and around
it can be plainly seen in the photograph. That, too, is a very
old box, about 25 years old.
Fig. 3 shows an ordinary box, in which a Coal Tit was
brooding newly-hatched young ones when we photographed it.
Fig. 4 contained a brood of young Great Tits.

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
(&amp;apos;Continued from page 214).
Of the pair of young birds hatched on or about March
18th, one died on April 15th, but the other, though rather a
weak bird for some time, managed to pull through all right, and
is now quite a fine bird, and just assuming the adult male
plumage, at the age of about ten weeks.
The three young birds about which I have now written,
and of which unfortunately one only has been reared to
maturity, were hatched in the midst of very artificial surround-
ings, and too early in the year. I should have done wisely had
I compelled the birds to wait until the warm weather and long
days had arrived before commencing nesting operations, for
without these it is difficult if not impossible to rear strong
young birds, as I now know, even though the aviary be kept at
a genial temperature.
On the 15th of April the hen Elegans was put out with
the second cock, an even finer bird than the first, into a large
open aviary, in which vegetation is allowed to grow in profusion,
and where things are more in accordance with the natural
surroundings of the Brush Bronzewing Pigeons. From this
time onward matters went ahead without a hitch. On the 26th
of the same month an egg was laid, and followed by another the
next day, and incubation was carried out in earnest. O11 May
12th I discovered an egg-shell from which a young Bronzewing
had evidently just emerged. Two remarkably fine young birds
left the nest, strong fliers, on June 3rd, and were seen to
pick up seeds for themselves a week later. These two young
birds, hatched and reared under conditions closely approximating
those to which they would be subject in a state of nature, could
fly as strongly when just over three weeks old as the first
youngster, reared under artificial conditions, could at double
that age. The old birds have another nest and are sitting well.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
For the history of Phcips elegans in its native wilds we
must turn to the works of the great John Gould and Mr. A. J.
Campbell. The former writes: "This species is neither so
plentiful nor so widely distributed as the Common Bronzewing
(.Phaps chalcoptera ) ; it is, however, tolerably abundant in
Tasmania, the islands in Bass's Straits, and the whole of the
southern portion of the Australian Continent, from the Swan
River on the west to Moreton Bay on the east. In Tasmania it
is very numerous, from Circular Head to the north-eastern
corner of the island. It affects the most scrubby localities,
giving preference to such as are low and swampy ; and I have
never seen it perch on the branches of trees. When flushed, it
rises very quickly with a loud burring noise similar to that made
by the rising of a Partridge. The shortness of its wings and
tail, the extreme depth of its pectoral muscle, render its
appearance more plump and round than the generality of
Pigeons. It is a very difficult bird to shoot, from its inhabiting
the denser part of the scrub, from which it is not easily driven.
It flies but little, rarely for a greater distance than to cross a
gully or top a ridge before it again abruptly descends into the
scrub.
" Its food consists of seeds and berries of various kinds,
particularly in Tasmania of a plant called Boobyaller.
" I believe it never migrates, but merely removes from
one locality to another, as food may be more or less abundant.
" Its note, more lengthened than that of the Common
Bronzewing, is a low and mournful strain, and is more often
repeated towards the close of the evening than at any other
time.On a comparison of this species with the Phaps
chalcoptera , the two birds will be found to differ materially
in structure ; the wings of the present species being shorter,
and the tail comprising a smaller number of feathers, than that
of the other."
It is extremely strange that so excellent an observer as
Gould, who must have come across many of these birds, should
state that " the sexes differ so little in colouring of their plumage
that dissection is requisite to distinguish them," for not only is

it perfectly easy to distinguish the sex of the adults at a glance,
but the young when in the nest are distinguishable by the
brighter and deeper tints of the young male.
It is curious also that Gould should never have seen this
species perch on the branches of trees, for those that have been
under my observation for the last six months certainly show
quite as much inclination to perch on branches as does the Phaps
chalcoptera. Mr. Campbell writes :--
" The Brouzewing loves the open and the forest, but the
Brush Bronzewing is more shy and solitary, and, as its name
indicates, prefers scrubby situations and the growth about
swampy places. I have seen the birds and obtained their eggs
in the Leptospermum tracts that gird the shores of Port Philip
Bay, and also in the west in the short thick scrubs of King
George's Sound. In Western Australia it is fond ,of placing its
nest in the fork of a grass tree ( Xanthorrhoea ).
" Writing from Yorke Peninsula, South Australia, Mr. G.
McDougall states he found the Bronzewing a rare bird there,
while its Brush congener was common in the mallee scrub and
melaleuca swamps, and further, that the kangaroo hunters rear
and sell the young of the latter bird.
" In Tasmania, Mr. A. E. Brent observes, the Brush
Bronze-wing usually seeks the sides of deep gullies for a nesting
place, and almost in every instance the shady side of the same.
" Like the other Bronze-winged Pigeon, the Brush bird
breeds almost any time of the season, but usually during the
months from October to January."
The nesting habits of P. elegans seem to be just the same
as those of P. chalcoptera ; the male appears to select the site for
the nest, and having found what he considers a suitable place, he
invites his mate to inspect it by his oft repeated " hoop, hoop,
hoop." If she will deign to inspect it he is immensely pleased,
and shows his pleasure by nodding his head and flipping his
wings. Should the hen approve of the site, she settles herself
down on it, while the cock descends to the ground to search for

building materials in the shape of fine twigs. If the hen does
not deign to come and inspect the site selected by her lord and
master, the latter becomes impatient and flies to her and
commences to chase her about, running and jumping after her,
and every now and then stopping to bow and throw up his
gorgeous wings over his back, spreading the tail, and uttering a
soft grunting coo at the. same time.
The Brush Bronzewing is rather smaller than its congener,
the Common Bronzwing ; and after having kept both species for
some time I must say that I much prefer the smaller kind, much
as I love my old friend P. chalcoptera.
Phaps elegans is about thirteen inches in length. The
male has the forehead bright chestnut; a band of the same
colour passes from the eyes to the occiput; lores black ; crown
dark grey; the hind neck and upper back rich chestnut with a
purplish tinge ; lower back and wings rich brown ; cheeks and
ear-coverts whitish ; a triangular patch of dark chestnut on the
throat ; lower cheeks and underparts delicate bluish-grey;
bright metallic green, copper, blue and red reflections on the
wing-coverts ; under wing-coverts light chestnut.
The female differs in having all her markings duller and
less distinct ; the breast and underparts dull brownish grey.
The young bird at 17 days old is dark brown above, each
feather having a narrow band of whitish buff at the tip ; a white
line from the base of the bill runs below the eye to the ear-
coverts ; underparts dark grey, the feathers more or less tipped
with whitish. At 26 days old a rich chestnut tinge has appeared
on the nape, and the borders of the feathers have become more
reddish. At this age the sexes can be distinguished, as the male
shows more chestnut on the nape and forehead, and white 011 the
cheeks.
At the age of nine or ten weeks the young bird moults
into the adult plumage.

Paroaria larvata.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D.
Although, according to the late Dr. Russ, this species is
more generally bred in Germany than P. cucullata, I cannot call
to mind a single instance of the rearing of a successful brood in
England ; yet, with a bird frequently imported, it seems im-
probable that it should not have been bred.
As recorded in " Foreign Finches in Captivity" I pur-
chased my first example of P. larvata in February 1894, and as a
second example given to me early in 1895 proved to be of the
opposite sex, I turned the pair into one of my smallest aviaries
and hoped for good results : in this case, as in many others, I was
doomed to disappointment; for, although the pair played at build-
ing and the discovery of a broken egg-shell on the floor clearly
proved that the hen was ready, no nest was ever completed.
After the death of this pair, I purchased no more
Dominican Cardinals (or ' Popes ' as they are sometimes called)
until August 1903, when Mr. Housden brought me a very perfect
pair, which I turned out into one of my bird-room aviaries. At
the end of this aviary, near to the ceiling, is a sort of shelf of
brushwood, the base being formed of pea-sticks resting at one
extremity on a shallow square box screwed into the corner, at its
centre by a stout natural branch let into the wall, and at the other
extremity by nest boxes and the wire dividing this from the
adjoining aviary.
In March 1904 the cock bird began to sing vociferously to
the hen, and chase her about the aviary ; she sang in reply, but
in a lower key: shortly afterwards he began to carry about sticks
and straws, pretending to put them into the shallow box support-
ing the end of the pea-sticks, but invariably carrying them away
again.
Early in April I noticed the hen also carrying sticks about,
and soon it was evident that a nest was being built in the
extremely cramped situation selected by the birds. By the third

Dr. A. G. Butler,
week in April the hen was sitting steadily, and I hoped that all
would be well; the cock sat on a branch near the nest and
vigorously attacked every other bird which approached ; he even
drove a Necklaced Dove paired to a hen White Barbary from their
eggs, in a nest on top of the brushwood, so that the latter failed
to get steadily incubated.
At the end of the month both birds suddenly deserted the
nest and seemed far from well; on May 2nd the cock died,
evidently from inflammation of the bowels; and on the 4th the
hen followed his example : I am afraid that a consignment of
unusually dusty millet received a few days before they were taken
ill, must have been at the root of the trouble ; but it is strange
that no other birds in the aviary were affected.
O11 examining the nest, two eggs were found in it; owing
to the cramped unnatural shape of the concavity (it could not be
correctly called a cup) one egg was only so far incubated that the
yolk was somewhat toughened, and burst through the shell when
I tried to blow it; the other was distinctly incubated the embryo
beginning to take form and veined with blood, but was not
sufficiently advanced for the time ; indeed it ought to have been
ready to hatch, as the hen had been sitting quite a fortnight.
Both birds being in good condition, I sent them to a
taxidermist to be prepared as skins; and I asked him at the
same time to sex them. On the iotli they came to hand with the
following instructive information--" The first Cardinal you sent
was a $, my brother skinned it, and he says he should think the
bird was laying, as the ovaries* were very large. The last one,
which I skinned, was also a female."
It is perhaps a peculiarity of female Cardinals, when they
possess two functional ovaries, that they are endowed with all the
external characters and possess all the reproductive powers of
male birds; that the} ? sing to and chase other hens, show them
where to build, and indeed, so far as the aviculturist is concerned,
answer the purpose equally well.f It is absolutely certain that
* These italics are mine.--A. G. B.
t The taxidermist must have mistaken the male organs for " large ovaries." If the
eggs were really fertilized the bird was of course a male.--E d.

the bird described as having "large ovaries" was the only one
that could have been responsible for the fertilization of the eggs,
since the only other birds in the aviary were Java Sparrows,
Saffron-finches, an aged Magpie Mannikin, and six Doves.
As is well known to aviculturists, the male sex in the S.
American Cardinals is smaller than the female: this is especially
noticeable in the Green Cardinal (Giibernatrix cristata) but in the
Red-headed species one does not notice it much during the life
of the birds ; though, after death, when male and female can be
compared side by side, the discrepancy is seen to be well-
marked.*
In the two skius now returned to me the male is about
three-fourths of an inch shorter than the female, and there is no
evidence of unnatural shrinkage in this skin or of unnatural
stretching in that of the female: even allowing a margin for
both, the discrepancy in size could not be ignored. I11 the
second place the beak of the male is short and broad with well
arched culmen, that of the female long and distinctly narrower
with culmen slightly less arched ; the crown of the male is
broader and shorter than in the female; and the latter shows
a little more white in the wings, but I think this character is
variable.
Considering that these two birds are both declared to be
hens, it is a pity the young were not reared ; with two mothers
they should have done well !
The eggs of P. larvata, according to Dr. Russ, are "pale
green, spotted and speckled with brownish " : strictly speaking
this is not correct. The ground-colour of the egg is indeed
extremely pale green, it might almost be called greenish-white,
but the markings are olivaceous, not brownish. Of about the
same size as a Dipper's egg, but shaped more like that of the
Missel-Thrush, it has the ground-tint of a Linnet's egg, the
marking of a Sparrow's, but with the markings coloured as in the
Dartford Warbler's egg. It vaguely resembles some eggs of the
Blackbird, but the ground-tint is paler and bluer, and the mark-
ings far less red.
* Herr Wiener speaks of the female P. cucullata as sometimes smaller than the male :
perhaps he may be right.--A. G, B.

Leptoptila reickenbachi.
By Miss R. Aederson.
A short time ago I was away from home, and whilst
talking to an avicultural friend he suddenly asked me, " Why do
3 ? ou care for those silly doves ? "
My first thought, when I had somewhat recovered at hear-
ing my favourites so described, was that this was exactly the
opinion I constantly heard at home. My second thought, that
here was a fine opportunity to defend my pets, if only I could
make the most of it: possibly I might even make a convert.
Unfortunately this opinion is not a solitary one. Doves
are not yet as popular as they should be, but those who do not
keep them little know what pleasure they miss.
I am constantly told "doves are so silly, they have no
character. I had rather have one parrot than a dozen doves."
But both the doves and I have got hardened. We do not care
for outside opinion, but are content to understand and enjoy
each other's society.
I have always cared for these birds since the time when as
small children we had one fine cock Barbary, whom (with a very
vague knowledge of Latin) we named " Cooey Columbies." Like
all Barbarys he got very tame, and would coo when we told him
to, while I used to gaze in admiration on his soft creamy plumage,
and beautiful eyes like jewels.
Poor " Cooey " came to a sad end. He was found one day
murdered and mutilated, a victim to the jealousy of a pet Jack-
daw. After a solemn consultation we decided that the murderer,
as a punishment, was to be taken from the aviary and put into
what we called the " educational cage." This structure was
really large enough lor him to have lived in comfortably, but
before long he died, probably less from remorse than disappoint-
ment and disgust at the fact that we had totally misunderstood
the motive of his act.
Years after this I read our valued member Mr. Cresswell's
most interesting article 011 doves in "The Feathered World."

on the Nesting of the Rufous Dove. 271
It revived the taste I had always had for these birds. I read and
re-read it, wondering if I ever should be fortunate enough to
possess all the doves whose portraits were depicted, but such
good fortune seemed almost too much to expect.
I must start with small beginnings, so I began my small
collection with a pair of British Turtle-doves, gradually getting
more birds until now I have about twenty-six kinds of doves and
pigeons. But there are still many more that I am ambitious to
possess, and I can honestly say the more doves I have the more
I want. Aviaries, however, are not expansive, and doves are--
fortunately--hardy, healthy and long lived, and as I do not
care to part with old favourites in exchange for new ones, I
have to limit my numbers.
I got my first pair of Rufous Doves in September, 1902. To
be more correct only one (the hen bird) was a Rufous, the cock
is a dove I do not know the name of, but for convenience I will
call it the Green Dove. These two birds, though rather alike in
shape and size were quite different in colour. The true Rufous
has an olive brown back and wings. The forehead is a lovely blue
grey, the breast a warm rufous colour. A purple wash covers the
shoulders. In size it is rather larger than a Bleedingheart but of
a more upright build. The Rufous always looks as if it might
have been sitting in a sunset, and caught some of the glow : its
colour is so rich and warm.
The Green cock is rather larger, of a greyish colour,
getting darker on the back and wings. It has a most beautiful
green sheen on the neck, like the green pearl in a shell, the eyes
orange, and the inside of the wings a lovely copper colour. So
many of the doves, Rufous, Bleedingheart, Bronzewing, Violet,
and others have this last peculiarit} 7 , and it is most noticeable
when the bird is bathing in a shower. To-day I was watching
one of my Bronzewings laid perfectly motionless on its side in
the heavy rain, with one wing stretched in a splendid arch over
its back, showing the lovely copper lining to perfection. Any-
one not used to the little ways of Doves, would have thought it
dead, or very ill, but it was merely enjoying a shower bath to its
heart's content.

Miss R. Alderson,
The supposed pair of Rufous Doves, by a mistake on the
journey, got right down into Warwickshire, and though sent off
on Frida}&amp;apos; did not reach me until Sunday morning. They had no
food nor water in their hamper, but they seemed none the worse
for their long journey. Their value is 25/- to 30/- per pair.
Just about this time I had an offer of an odd dove from
Brazil for 5/-. It was said to be the size and shape of a Bleeding-
heart. At the time I declined it, but often (unfortunately for my
purse) this fact of declining does not end the matter, and after I
have refused a bird I generally only think the more about it. So
it ended that I committed yet another weak extravagance, and
made an exchange by which this little odd dove became mine.
I found it rather smaller than the Green cock, but in other
respects exactly the same, and I believe by a strange chance I
have really (by a mistake) got a true pair of a rare dove. For a
long time the new comer could not fly. Though otherwise strong
and healthy, I have never had a dove with its wings in such a
sore state, they were one long wound from end to end of each
shoulder.
I11 .1903 I put these three birds together in an aviary with
others. Two separate nests were started at the same time, which
at least showed I had one cock and two hens, but though they laid
fertile eggs I never reared any young ones, nor did I succeed
when previously the supposed Rufous had nested by them-
selves.
I11 November, 1903, I purchased a true pair of Rufous
Doves--they were both alike, and the same as the hen bird I had
got the year before. This pair I kept through the winter in
another aviary, and in March they began to nest. But the eggs
got broken, and the nests were failures. I then put my first hen
in the same house, and the cock of the true pair quickly turned
to her, forsaking his own mate, and only three or four days later
the pair were nesting and sitting. The three birds agreed, but
I thought it better to remove the odd hen into another aviary.
Here she formed a great friendship with a Violet Dove that could
not fly. It is perhaps a curious fact worth mentioning that
after it became friends with the Violet Dove this Rufous always

on the Nesting of the Rufous Dove.
kept to the ground, though it could fly quite well when they
were first put together.
Meanwhile the pair of Rufous were sitting well, and on
April 26th the first egg was hatched. In the same aviary (which
is about 16ft. by 6#ft.) were also the pair of Green Doves, and a
pair each of Auritas and Bronzewings. All these four pairs were
nesting at once in perfect peace, except for a small fight at first
between the cock Rufous and cock Aurita.
Both the Rufous Doves were ideal parents, and it was not
until the young ones were about nine days old that the old birds
left the nest even for a little time. The nest was very high up,
but I managed to get a glimpse of one 3^oung bird. It looked
strong and healthy and was olive brown with light brown breast,
and white under parts. The forehead was light-coloured with a
light whitish streak running from the beak over the eye.
On May 13th, when the young birds would be about 17
days old, they both came out of the nest and reached the ground
in safety.
I have mentioned before in writing of doves that it is
essential to have a wooden crib (made of 11-inch high floor
boards) on the aviary floor under the nest. The crib of course
filled with a good bed of straw or hay. If you neglect this simple
precaution you will probably find your young birds dead, or
with a broken wing on their first descent from the nest, for they
are very fragile little creatures, and their small bones are soft,
and if startled by the other birds they may lose their hold and
fall heavily, with fatal results.
The Rufous family made such a pretty picture when I first
found the young ones out, for all four were nestling together in
the straw, the old birds in a state of great pride and contentment.
I find most of my doves, if good parents, have great
pleasure in their young ones, and they quite seem to wish me to
share it too. I am sure birds have much more sense in this way
than people give them credit for.
Two days after the Rufous left the nest, the little Bronze-
wings followed their example, and the four small birds used to
sit together on the straw, the greatest of friends.

On the Nesting of the Rufous Dove.
Now that the young Rufous were out, I could see them
better. Their length was about seven inches, their beaks were
long and dark horn-coloured, the feet and legs dark crimson, the
two outer feathers on each side of the tail tipped with white.
On the wings were light brown spots or marks, (like those on
a young Violet Dove); the eyes were like those of all young
doves--dark, and with a very innocent look about them.
Meanwhile, the poor Green Doves had lost both their
young ones when only a few days old. They used to watch the
young Rufous with hungry eyes, and one day I was touched to
see the Green cock timidly preening their feathers. When he
found the little birds did not mind, he proceeded further, and
started to feed them as well. As their own parents fed them
well too it is no wonder the young Rufous thrived. " Millie,"
the hen Rufous, is a very loving motherly sort of bird. She
preened the young Bronzewings, was devoted to her own young
ones, and lavished the most affectionate caresses on her husband.
In another division of the same aviary was a case of great
contrast. A poor little Necklace Dove, just about the same age
as the young Rufous, but getting weaker and weaker through
the inattention of its parents, who had no affection for it, and
were starting to nest again. At last I could stand their neglect no
longer, and seeing the young Necklace would die if left with its
parents, I determined to try it in the house where the Rufous
were. I put the little Necklace on the floor, but it was so weak
it could hardly stand. I saw the eye of the Green cock light up
with pleasure, but he evidently did not dare to come to the
rescue, though he was burning to do so, for he stands rather in
awe of Millie. She acted very promptly, and at once took the
matter in her own hands--or rather beak--for she went straight
up to the young Necklace and began to feed it. It was very
grateful, but Millie was evidently puzzled to find it so weak after
her robust young ones, and still more perplexed when it tried to
nestle under her for warmth. She was very gentle with it, but
she could not well stay brooding it on the aviary floor all night,
so eventually I got a pair of Barbary Doves and gave the Neck-
lace to them. They took kindly to it, but it had got too weak
to recover, and died later.

Bird Notes Jrom the Zoological Gardens. 275
After the Rufous had left the nest the Green Doves took
to it (the old Rufous having chosen another site) but the young
ones still came back to their old home now and then, and it was
pretty to see one 011 each side of the sitting Green cock--that
good-tempered bird seeming quite to enjoy having them with
him.
I moved the young Bronzewings and Rufous when they
were about five weeks old, for they began to be in the way of the
old birds who were starting to nest again. The four young ones
are now getting quite big birds. In the Rufous the spots on the
wings have nearly disappeared, their foreheads are becoming
lighter, and in one bird especially the ruddy breast is getting
very decided.
The nesting of the Rufous has been one of the pleasantest
experiences I have ever had in rearing young birds, and is some
consolation for my many disappointments and failures. If any-
one wants to learn patience under failure, let him take up either
photography or bird keeping: either is a good tutor. One thing
is a great encouragement to me in my love for Doves,--I feel the
general taste for them is gradually but surely growing. New and
rare species are being imported, old kinds are cheaper and
easier to get. I can see a great change even during the few
years I have been keeping doves. So I end these notes with the
hope that at no distant date my favourites may be understood
and appreciated as they deserve to be.

The most notable additions are those which are starred,
being- new to the collection, namely, three Andaman Banded
Crakes, one Gold-crested Mynah, one Blue-capped Tanager,
Grey Solitaire, and two Cayman Island Parrots.
The gardens are particularly interesting to bird lovers at
this time of year, as many species are nesting. Great numbers
of young Pheasants of all kinds are being reared, as well as a
good many Waterfowl of different kinds.
Two young Brush-Turkeys have emerged from their
mound, and I am informed that when only a few hours old they
could fly well, and were seen scratching up little mounds on
their own account.
The Crested Screamers (Chawia cristata ) in the old Flying
Aviary have nested, probably for the first time on record in
captivity. Three nests were built before the birds finally settled
down to lay in the one selected, which was situated behind a
large boulder. Three eggs were laid, but we have not heard of
any young being hatched. Both eggs and young are said by
those who have known the species in a wild state to closely
resemble those of a Goose.
The Laughing Kingfishers hatched and devoured their
young, as they did last year. A Weka clutch has been hatched,
the pai&amp;apos;ents of which belong to two distinct species, namely the
Common Weka (Ocydromus australis ) and Earl's Weka ( O.earli ).
This is probably the first time that Weka Rails have hatched in
this country, as they nearly always eat their eggs. Mr. Blaauw
has had eggs laid by Wekas, but these have almost invariably
been eaten by the birds. One that was placed under a bantam
hatched, but the young bird was not reared.--D. S.-S.

Thorpe, of Hull, has had a good number through his hands, as
well as many other rare Neotropical birds.
I received a pair of these very pretty little Doves on the
28th of August, 1903, and turned them straight out into my out-
door aviary. They showed no sign of nesting during the
autumn, and spent the winter in the warmed aviary with the
majority of my other birds.
Early in April they were let out with most of the other
Doves into the large outdoor aviary, and immediately showed
signs of nesting. They selected a site on some rough ivy stems
that had been fastened up in a plum tree. The cock would sit on
this and coo, a peculiar coo unlike that of any other Dove I
know, and at each coo he would throw up his pretty rounded tail
into a perpendicular attitude. They commenced to sit on the
19th of April and sat well, taking turns with one another, the
cock doubtless sitting in the day and the hen at night like other
Doves, but they are so exactly alike that it was impossible to say
which was the cock or hen. On the 8th of May I noticed both
birds away from the nest, and upon examination discovered two
young ones, apparently about a week old, dead in the nest. The
night before had been extremely cold, and possibly the sitting
bird may have been frightened off during the night and the
young have perished from exposure.
The pair soon set to work again however and repaired the
old nest, which is exactly like that of other Doves, consisting
merely of a few fine twigs. O11 the 12th of June I noticed three
Scaly Doves sitting together on a branch, and except that the
third was much smaller than the others, with a short tail and
general baby-like appearance, it exactly resembled its parents.
I have not heard of any case in which the Scaly Dove has
reared young before in this country, although from an article by
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.982740552631579" page_id="32958995"  page_num="Page 279" year="" vol="">
on the Nesting of the Scaly Dove. 279
Dr. Greene in Notes on Cage Birds (Second Series, page 252) it
would appear as though there were nothing exceptional about
the achievement of my little pair. The writer there says: " The
nestlings differ considerably from their parents in appearance,
for their colour, until after the first moult, is a pale ashen-grey,
very slightly marked with the scaly undulations that are so con-
spicuous in the old birds." This description does not at all
agree with my young bird, which is slightly whiter than its
parents, and the undulations perfectly distinct though not quite
so broad as those of the adults. I do not know of any other
Dove in which the young so very closely resemble the adults in
plumage. I therefore wrote to Dr. Greene, asking him if he
actually knew of a case in which young had been reared in this
country, and he has kindly replied as follows : "I do not
remember where I got the particulars about these Doves that
appear in Notes on Cage Birds , but probably from Russ, whose
work Die Fremdlaiidischen Stubenvogel, I have not by me now.
I have not kept this species and have not any personal knowledge
of its having bred in this country."
As several others of our members have pairs of these
Doves it is quite possible that I am not the first to have bred the
species, but perhaps in any case my experience is worth putting
on record.
The Scaly Doves are certainly not very peaceably inclined
towards the other Doves in the aviary while they are nesting,
and do their best to drive them all away ; nevertheless, two or
three young Diamond Doves have been reared within a few yards
of the nest of the Scalies.
For the benefit of those who do not know the Scaly Dove
I may say that it is about eight inches in length, of a very light
brown above, and white below, with each feather edged with a
crescentic bar of black, which gives it a very scaly appearance.
This species seems to be subject to melanism, for the
dealer from whom I obtained my pair also sent me, on approval,
a pair that were almost entirely black.
The Scaly Dove ranges from the southern border of the
United States and Mexico, through Central America to Brazil.

BREEDING BUDGERIGARS.
Sir,--C ould you please give me some hints on breeding Budgerigars ?
I have had three pairs in a large outdoor aviary for the last six months, but
I do not seem able to rear any young ones. The hens frequently drop their
eggs while on the perch, and get egg-bound. Is this through incorrect
feeding ? I give them three parts white millet and one part plain canary with
a little hemp and crushed oats once a week. The seed pan in the aviary I
a 1 ways keep full. Is this a bad plan ? and would it be better to feed with a
little seed night and morning. Although this way I should find rather
troublesome. The aviary is partly grassed over and I give them green stuff
every other day. Is soaked bread necessary&amp;apos; before the young are hatched ?

I believe also the mice get the eggs out of the husks, as I sometimes
find eggs on the floor just bitten on one side, but the yolk is still in the
shell and one would be inclined to think that if mice had been the robbers
they would suck the eggs quite dry.
Do you think the husks hung from the aviary ceiling a good way?
They seem rather wobbly to me this way, mine at present are fastened
secure to the wall and the birds seem to enjoy sitting on them.
Frank Bathe.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Frank Bathe:
I think the secret of your failure lies with the cocoa-nut husks. I
have always noticed that the eggs and young are liable to be thrown out of
these, as the actual nest is too near to the entrance hole.
I have found boxes * to answer very much better. These are made
five or six inches square by seven or eight inches high, with the entrance-
hole (about au inch and a quarter in diameter) near the top. The bottom is
made of thick wood and slightly hollowed. The lid is made to open, and
the boxes are securely fastened against the wall; not hung from the roof.
The only seed required is canary, and the seed-pan should be kept full
of this; and when the young are hatched soaked bread is very useful.
Green food, such as chickweed, groundsel, or flowering grass, should be
given in abundance. D. Seth-Smith.
YEW TREES AND BIRDS.
Sir,--I n my new aviary I have planted some yew trees because they
give such grand cover.
I see in au old number of the Avicultural Magazine a note to the
effect that yews are most dangerous in au aviary.
Is this fact or fancy ? Of course I know they are bad for cattle.
P.S.--Chiefly foreign finches in this division of aviary.
- W. E. l&amp;apos;ESCHEMAKER.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Teschemaker:
I am afraid that there is no doubt that yews are poisonous.
I once tried one or two small yews in my aviaries, and about that
time several of my little finches died: although I did not have post mortem
examinations made of the bodies, it is probable that the yews were respon-
sible for the death of some, at least, of them.
Oddly enough, the berries of yew trees are eaten with impunity by
many birds. A. G. Butter.

Sir, --I think you may be interested to hear that I have successfully
paired my Hooded Siskin with a green Canary, and that they have reared
three " Mista Cauarias" (the fourth egg addled) which will be three weeks
old on the 23rd. They are very forward and sit on perches all day and night,
and one flew across the room to-day. Their markings are good but not very
dark, and so far, though not green, are not the orange of the Mista canaria
from Teneriffe, though I have no doubt they will get so after their first
moult. I also paired the Mista canaria, but his hen sat badly and has
only reared one bird out of four eggs. This bird seems smaller than the
others and has quite as much orange tinge as the true Mista canarias. Both
hens are beginning to prepare fresh nests.
M. Norman.
Chelsea , May 21st. -
Sir, --Our member Miss M. Norman, having been successful in
breeding with the offspring of the Hooded Siskin and Canary (the Mista
canaria ), I asked her to allow her letter to be published in the Magazine.
Although fertile hybrids are common enough in the orders Anseres,
Columbce, and Gallince, they seem to be rarer in the Passeres, and
particularly in the family Fringillidce ; it is therefore important to put every
case on record. A. G. Butler.

Sir,--C an j&amp;apos;ou kindly give me any advice as to rearing young Water
Ouzels ? I am trying to bring up two.
I have a nest full of Hooded Crows reared. I gave them egg (shell
and all), raw meat and milk, and sometimes a lump of pap to stop their
mouths when I was feeding the dogs or other birds.
J. FFOLLIOTT DARLING.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. ffolliott Darling:
The late Lord Lilford tried very hard to rear Dippers, but was never
able to keep them alive for more than three mouths. Three or four years
ago Dr. Sharpe had a similar experieuce.
If the Water Ouzel is to be reared, I should think "Century Food,"
given very moist until the young were able to pick, would be most likely to
succeed. I should add small earthworms, and, if 3-011 can get them, caddis-
worms.
The failure to rear many' insectivorous birds is undoubtedly due to
their being fed upon minced raw beef, which brings on diarrhoea and
apoplectic fits.
I believe it is possible to rear any of the Crows upon soaked bread and
minced raw beef; but, with the typical insectivorous birds, it is another
matter altogether. A. G. Bui&amp;apos;LFR.

investment in foreign birds was in the previous year, when I had bought
one dozen cock Budgerigars from the late Anton Jamrach. The Lovebirds
were turned into a large cage with the Australian Parrakeets. A cocoanut
shell was hanging on the centre post, and within a very short time one of
the hens took possession and began to lay eggs, which the mischievous
Budgerigars quickly threw out. I knew nothing of bird-life then, and have
so often regretted that I did not clear out the Budgerigars, and leave a clear
field for the Lovebirds, for I did not know it was rare for them to breed.
I cannot understand why the wing feathers are cut, as the birds are
far quieter than Budgerigars which arrived unmutilated. Their quill
stumps I have never attempted to pull out, but let the birds moult them
as best they can. For food they get Indian spray and Italian white
millet--chickweed and sprays of grass in seed and flower. They are fond of
gnawing cuttle-fish bone, but although grit is kept at the bottom of the
cage, I have never during all these years seen one on the floor pecking it.
I lately had a pair from one of our members who said he fed them on
canary seed and rice, and had never lost any. Although I have tried mine
with oats, grass seeds, and canary in separate dishes, they will not touch
them, but remain true to the millet.
With me the average life in cages is six years, but I kept one hen for
nearly ten years. W. T. CaTeeugh.

APPRECIATION OF KINDNESS BY ROBINS.

<bodyText confidence="0.995202545454545" page_id="32958999"  page_num="Page 283" year="" vol="">
Sir, --I should like to relate a short incident showing that birds do
really understand and appreciate our care for them. We had a pair of wild
Robins in the garden that I had tamed. The hen fed from our hands, the
cock who was shyer would only feed at our feet. If he was alone he gave a
peculiar whistle which quickly brought the hen, however far out of sight
she might be, and with her coming he grew bolder.
These Robins had a family in a nest made in an old tin in a wood
below our garden, and I used to try and help the hardworking little pair
by feeding them to support their young ones.
I generally fed them by the aviary door, and one very wet day the
old birds came to me bringing their eldest son and heir to show me; a
poor little draggled baby Robin, wet through, but all the same a great
source of joy to his parents. I think it was on the next day I went down
to the aviary, and as I drew near the door I saw the Robins in a state of
great excitement. They had brought no less than seven baby Robins for
me to see, such sweet little things with spotted breasts and the blackest of
black eyes. The parents were in a state of great pride and excitement,
trying to keep the young ones in a circle near the door, a somewhat
difficult matter. You may imagine how I appreciated my Robins' trust
in me, and I felt I could not do less than throw the babies a handful
of mealworms to celebrate such an auspicious occasion and wish them
good luck. Rosie Aeoerson.

Cock Virginian Nightingale, three Pectoral Finches (Capt. G. Rice).
[Your bird has been ailing for some time. The right lung was con-
solidated as a result of pneumonia. The bird was much emaciated.
The immediate cause of death being acute pneumonia of left lung.
Two of. the Pectoral-finches died of enteritis. There was an inordinate
amount of grit in the gizzard and intestines which might have caused
this. You should be cautious in the use of grit to new birds, as if this
has been withheld for a considerable time, birds are apt to overdo
themselves if given freely. The third bird was too decomposed to
make a satisfactory examination. Both birds reported on were hens].
Californian Quail, hen (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). [She died of a fractured
skull; probably frightened, and in flying up struck her head].
Rock Pebbler, lieu (Mrs. Noble). [The bird died of dysentery and
exhaustion].
Masked Fire-finch (Mr. Roberts). [Your bird died of concussion of the
brain].
Young Budgerigar (Rev. R. H. Wilmot). [This is undoubtedly one of
those cases in which for some cause (usually weakness from over-
breeding) the parents become inattentive to their young. The young
come out of the nest before they are strong enough owing to being
hungry. The dirty nest is another proof of the parents' inattention.
The young birds which die in the nest should be removed at once, as,
if decomposition commences, the vitiated atmosphere causes sickness
and sometimes death amongst the others. Do not let them raise more
than four for the next nest or two. Your bird died of starvation].
Orange-cheeked Waxbill (The Hon. Lilia de Yarburgli Bateson).
[Your bird died of jaundice. It was a hen].
Siskin (The H011. Lilia de Yarburgli Bateson). [Pneumonia was the cause
of death],
Bloodrump Parrakeet (Mr. Moerschell). [Your bird died of enteritis
(inflammation of the bowels). I should be almost inclined to blame
the green food. Should you have another case of diarrhoea, separate
the bird and give three drops of Browne's clilorodyne and 15 grains of
prepared chalk in one ounce of drinking-water, and stop the green
food].
Bullfinch, hen (Mr. Moerschell). [Concussion of brain -was the cause of
death. Possibly the Cockatiels are responsible for it].
Two Golden Pheasant chicks (Miss Appleton). [Both chicks died of
enteritis. Try the following food: Good ants'eggs, fresh if possible;

" Your Traveller was right in saying that the three nests ot

WATKIN WATKINS, B.A. Cantab.
Member of the British Ornithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. \V. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as tli^ frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
&amp;apos; Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Rovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos; The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Bvron, Chaucer, Milton, Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. IS. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about

By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The remarkable groups of Neotropical birds known as
Tinamous, and constituting the order Crypturi are not very well
known to aviculturists, with the exception of perhaps one or two
of the commoner species, but they are such interesting and
curious birds as to be very well worth special attention. In size
they vary from that of a good-sized fowl to that of a Quail, and,
though somewhat resembling the Gallincz in outward appearance,
they are, in reality, widely different from these, both in structure
and habits, and show considerable affinity to the Ratitcc.
The common Rufous Tinamou, Rhynchotus rufesce?is, is well
known to most people, and has frequently bred in this country,
both in aviaries and at liberty, and the late Mr. Bartlett has
written an interesting paper on the nesting of this species at the
Zoo. ( Proc . Zool. Sac., 1868, p. 115). The smaller species are
however little known in this country, being very seldom
imported ; and I was very glad, last autumn, to have an oppor-
tunity of securing a pair of the small Crypturus tataupa, from
Brazil, a species about the size of a Californian Quail, which has
not been represented in the London Zoological Gardens for more
than twenty years.
Azara wrote an interesting account of the habits of the
Tataupa as long ago as 1805 : He tells us that it is often found

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
near to Country bouses, and inhabits woods and thickets. It
lays four eggs, of a beautiful purple colour, and the sitting bird,
when disturbed, flutters from the nest feigning lameness. He
kept some alive in a room where they carefully hid themselves,
only appearing to feed when no one was near. The notes are
louder and more brilliant than those of any of their congeners.
It commences its song with one high note, followed by an
interval of eight seconds; then the note is repeated at shorter
intervals, and then runs into a trill, followed by a sound like
\0x25A0chororo, repeated several times. He put three adults in a cage
during October and November, which sang; and in September
the following year they laid three eggs, but did not sit. When
sitting close, he tells us, it tips the body forward, pressing its
breast on the ground, and raising the rump higher than the back,
opening the feathers and spreading them into a semi-circle over
the back, so that when looked at from behind nothing is visible
but a fan of feathers.
Mr. W. A. Forbes, writing on " Eleven weeks in North-
Eastern Brazil " (Ibis, 1881, p. 369), remarks : " The ' Nambu,' as
the present species of Tinamou is called, is not at all an uncommon
bird in the neighbourhood of Macuca and Garanhuus, where I
several times heard its cry, and once or twice flushed it. Its
flight, however, though strong, is short, the bird soon settling
again ; and the country is so thickly covered with brushwood
and undergrowth that it is, in consequence, 110 easy matter to
shoot these birds, at least without the aid of dogs. Sometimes
they are startled and shot by Brazilian sportsmen ; but more
usually they are snared. At Garanhuus I bought a lot of
seventeen Nambus and a pair of the next species * for 2500 reis
{about five shillings)--not a bad bargain perhaps!--from a boy
who had just caught them ; and afterwards I had many more
offered me for sale."
My pair of Tataupas arrived on the 28th of August, 1903,
and were put into a fairly large aviary, consisting of a wooden
shed, some twelve feet square, with a grassed run of slightly
larger dimensions. The pair took kindly to their new home ;

and when they had been with me but a week or so I began to find
eggs dropped about in various places. On October the 4th I
noticed a nest behind a box in a corner of the covered part of the
aviary. It consisted simply of straw, feathers and leaves, the
only materials available at the time : and when discovered it con-
tained two eggs. O11 the morning of the 6th another egg had been
laid, and incubation, performed by the male only,was commenced.
The female, from the moment her mate commenced to sit, took
no further interest in the proceedings, in fact if she happened to
approach the nest the male would make a rush at her with open
mouth, so that she fled in terror. The male sat well, very seldom
leaving the nest, and when he did so, he always covered the eggs
most carefully with some of the rubbish with which the nest was
*composed. On the 2Sth of October, quite early in the morning, I
noticed the male off the nest, and upon examination discovered
that all three eggs had hatched. Two youngbirds were crouching
in the nest, but the third was just outside, and quite dead,
having apparently left too soon, and got chilled. The other two
were covered by their parent in the nest the whole of that day,
and did not leave until the morning of the 29th. The beginning
\0x25A0of November was cold, and I thought it best to transfer the
brood to a warmed aviary. They fed well on small earthworms,
gentles, and seed, but although for the first week they seemed to
*do well it was quite the wrong time of year to rear 3^oung
Tinamous, and on the seventh day after their birth one was
found dead. The other lived until a fortnight old, but for some
*days before it died it was decidedly weakly.
The birds were then separated for the winter, as they were
most anxious to nest again. When separated they constantly
called to one another, or rather the female called and the
male answered. The call of the female, which is much more
often heard than that of the male, consists of two or three loud
notes uttered at intervals of one or two seconds, followed by a
rapid succession of similar notes which run into a trill. The
male's call consists of three notes only, similar to, but some-
what less full than those of the female.
Early in April the two birds were put together again
and immediately commenced nesting operations. Before laying

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
commenced the female would spend a good deal of her time at
the nest, and a low clucking sound was audible. On April 19th
the male commenced to sit on four eggs, and, as before, the
female took no further interest in the proceedings. She was
heard to call frequently however, and when the male came off
the nest to feed, would run to him and display before him in the
most curious attitudes, with the obvious intention of persuading
him to mate with her again. The only effect, however, was to
make him furiously angry, and to display his auger by chasing
her round the aviary with open bill.
On May the iotli three chicks emerged from the four
eggs, the fourth containing a dead young bird. On the morning
of the 11 th the male left the nest with two chicks, the third
being left dead just outside the nest. The two chicks were
remarkably strong little birds, and I have no doubt that both
would have been successfully reared to maturity had not one
of them, to my inexpressible disgust, been accidently killed,
having run behind a moveable wire run, and been crushed.
The brood was therefore reduced to a single individual. This
bird progressed splendidly. He was fed on soft food (preserved
yolk of egg, fine crissel, preserved ants' eggs and bread crumbs)
to which was added finely chopped chickweed; small earth-
worms, which he was very fond of, and the most important item
of all--live gentles, which are kept in dry sand for two or three
days before being used.
At the age of ten days this chick could fly so well and
strongly that there was a danger of his injuring himself against
the wire-netting at the top of the aviary, and I thought it
advisable to catch him and clip the feathers of one wing. This
effectually prevented his flying for a week or so, but, as the
feathers when cut were not nearly full grown, he was able to fly
well again after a short time, and the operation had to be
repeated.
By June the 6tli another clutch of five eggs had been
laid, and the male commenced to sit; and on the 25th I noticed
egg shells outside the nest, although the male bird was sitting
tight. He left the nest the following morning with three chicks.

%
and a fourth was left dead in the nest, the fifth egg being addled.
All three are well and strong as I write (July 8th).
I cannot understand why the fourth chick was dead, for it
was right in the nest, and could not therefore have died of cold.
Neither could it have died of starvation, although the chicks
remain in the nest some twenty-four hours after hatching, for
upon dissection its stomach was found to contain a large amount
of yolk, which would have lasted it for several hours.
The young Tataupas are most charming little creatures,
and the very accurate and beautiful drawing which Mr. Gronvold
has prepared to accompany this paper shows the chick just
emerged from the shell, and is, I think, the only illustration that
has ever been made of the young of this species, and I much
doubt if the adult has been accurately figured either.
These chicks are extraordinarily strong on the leg from
the time they leave the nest, and are much more independent
than the young of the true gallinaceous birds, the parent seeming
to take but a casual interest in his chicks. Should a human
being approach close to the brood, he will not attempt to defend
his charges, but will immediately run away, while they will take
shelter in any scrap of herbage or rubbish that may be near.
As far as I have been able to observe, the chicks are absolutely
silent. A faint note is frequently heard, which I at first thought
was uttered bv the chick, but I am now convinced that it is the
parent's call-note to summon them to him.
A peculiar habit of the adult bird when alarmed was noted
by Azara, as mentioned above, namely, that of squatting 011 the
breast and throwing the tail into the air, forming the under tail-
coverts into a screen to hide the rest of the body, and thereby

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
becoming practically invisible amongst herbage or undergrowth
of any kind. (Figs, i and 2). It is very interesting to see this
habit, developed to a moderate extent, in the very young chicks;
the)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; too will, when they suspect danger, squat and throw up
their little tails, almost always arranging that the latter shall be
towards the object of their alarm.
A detailed description of the chick is unnecessary with
the plate before us, * but I may remark that in the plumage of
the chicks, as in that of the adult birds, there is an abundance
of the substance known as "powder down," and the living chick,
although exactly corresponding to the drawing in other respects,
looks considerably greyer, on account of the presence of this
substance. At the age of twelve days the chick is full-winged and
can fly strongly. The wing coverts are tipped with buffisk spots.
A few da}^s later the dark grey feathers begin to appear through
the down on the bod} r , but the feathers on the head are the last
to appear, as in most birds.
The single bird reared from the brood hatched on May the
10th, although still rather small (July 8 tli) is the image of the
adults, with the exception that it is still slightly spotted on the
wings, the feathers on the flanks and vent are less distinctly
margined with whitish, and the bill is lead-colour.
A description of the adult is quite unnecessary with the
plate before us (which certainly does very great credit both to
the artist and the chromo-lithographers). The living bird how-
ever does not show quite such a contrast between the grey of the
head and neck and the brown of the back as shown in the plate,
on account of the presence of the " powder down," before referred
to, which gives the whole bird a lead-coloured appearance. The
bird figured is the female, a slightly larger bird than the male,
and with a redder bill. She is not supposed to be taking any
notice of the chick, which, as above stated, looks to its male
parent entirely for support.
The egg-shell in the plate exactly represents the shell after
hatching ; but it is then a dull thing as compared with the

newly laid egg, which is an extremely beautiful object, as in fact
are the eggs of all the Tinanious. I think I can best describe
the colour as rich pink chocolate, and the surface is highly
glossed. The colour of the egg unfortunately fades rapidly after
it is blown. I was shown one in the British Museum, the only
one in the collection, which was a dirty whitish colour--about as
different to the thing when fresh as it could possibly be. The
egg measures 1-65&quot; x 1.25&quot;.
At page 104 of the present volume I called attention to a
most interesting account of the breeding in captivity of the
Martineta Tinamou ( Calopezas elegans ), by M. Delaurier, in
France, and I pointed out that he had proved this species to be
polyandrous, and I suggested that most probably all of the
Tinamous, and perhaps some other orders, would prove to be
so when their habits were known. Although the evidence that I
am able to bring forward is perhaps not quite as conclusive as it
might be, I have at any rate quite satisfied myself that polyandry
is the order of things with the species now under consideration,
and I think there can be little doubt that it obtains in all of the
Tinamous. I have stated above that the female, very soon after
having laid a clutch of eggs, showed unmistakably that she
wished to pair again with the original male, no other being then
at hand. On the first of June I heard from Mr. Thorpe, of
Hull (the dealer from whom I obtained the original pair of
Tataupas) that he was expecting a single bird of this species
in a few days, and, being anxious to prove whether this species
were polyandrous, I asked him to send it on immediately it
arrived, hoping that it would prove to be a male. It arrived
on the 6th, and I could tell from its small size that it was cer-
tainly a male, so I was glad to keep it.
At this time the original male had just commenced to sit
on a batch of six eggs ; nevertheless the female, when intro-
duced to the new male, showed unmistakable signs that she was
not only willing but anxious to nest again immediately. But
having been so very recently imported, and being unusually
timid, the new bird would have nothing whatever to do with
her ; but she made a nest behind some logs of wood and laid

two eggs within three weeks of the arrival of the new bird. I
think there can be no doubt whatever that had the new bird been
an acclimatised specimen and in breeding condition, the female
would have laid a full clutch, which he would have incubated.

By W. H. St. Quintin, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I picked up two Ravens in London in the spring of last
year, and thought that I had secured a pair, for the birds differed
considerably in size, and were excellent friends. However a
third was given to me a few mouths later by a kind friend, and
though a large Raven, I at once saw from its slender build and.
much less powerful beak, that this, at any rate, w&amp;apos;as a hen. Soon
after Christmas, it was evident that the new comer had made a
match of it with the big bird, and the lesser one had such an
uncomfortable time that I was glad to find it a peaceful home
elsewhere.
In the middle of February I fixed up a large flat basket in
a corner of the aviary where the Ravens were kept, and broke
up a faggot of larch twigs upon it, and supplied freely birds,
cockroaches, wool, and moss (the latter was never used). The
birds soon made up their minds, and set to work with such
energy that in a week the nest was ready for eggs.
We kept the aviary very quiet, as the female Raven was
rather timid, and I cannot give the exact date at which incuba-
tion commenced. I had to leave home on March ioth, and the
Raven was sitting close. As events turned out I believe that I
made a mistake in leaving instructions that, as soon as young
were heard, the parents were to be plentifully supplied with
small young rabbits, which the keepers, at the time, were killing
down ; and such Sparrows and mice as could be procured, and I
regret now that their diet was not varied with a more nourishing
rdgime, for I believe that the young in consequence suffered.
Anyhow, when I returned in the third week of April I
found that, though there were two noisy, and otherwise

vigorous, young in the nest, there was something uncanny about
their beaks, as they showed above the edge of the nest,
and they were plainly quite deformed. A week later I inspected
the nest and found one j^oung bird recently dead, with its leg
tightly twisted up in the wool which lined the nest. Its beak
was both twisted awry and the upper mandible projected
unnaturally over the lower one; the living nestling being also
disfigured in the same way. Moreover, if closely examined one
sees that the toes of one foot do not spread as they should.
However these defects do not affect the young bird's spirits, and
only the other day I watched him playing with a flat piece of
bone, burying it, and immediately digging it up, as if dissatisfied
with the security of his treasure, in the quaint way common to
the Crow family. But the poor bird cannot tear up tough food,
and we have to be careful to supply pieces that he can manage.
The parents, rather grudgingly, still (mid. July) feed him, and
should they cease to do this, I am afraid he may have some
difficulty in picking up a living. I attribute these defects to
insufficient nourishment (quality not quantity) when the nest-
lings were growing, as it seems to me to be a form of " rickets."
Anyhow I shall take care that, if I am lucky enough to have
another Ravens' nest next spring, there shall be plenty of more
substantial food at hand. It did not occur to me at the time, but
as a falconer I ought to have remembered that, though rabbit
flesh is a good change of food, especially in hot weather, Hawks
cannot work hard upon it ; and if fed too freely upon this meat,
will rapidly lose condition and stamina.
I11 conclusion may I appeal to anybody who keeps a tame
Raven, to see that he has a daily opportunity of a wash in a
deep bath of clean water, or the plumage will never be kept
smart. My Ravens are in faultless condition, and are constantly
bathing. Indeed one can scarcely give them greater pleasure
than to change their bath water, even several times a day, in
summer weather.

By A. E. E. Bertling.
(.Head Keeper of the Zoological Society&amp;apos;s Gardens.&amp;apos;)
In concluding my notes on the Brush Turkey (Talegalla
lathami ) I am glad to say we have now four young birds which
are thriving well.
Being somewhat doubtful as to the issue of the cock's
parental diligence, quite six weeks having elapsed since the
hens started laying, I decided to open the mound and see how
matters stood. Working the material away at one side we got
towards the centre and there discovered three eggs, which
lay about a foot away from each other and eighteen inches
below the top of the mound. They were placed in an upright
position, the larger end being uppermost, and it is quite evident
they are not turned as in the case of those laid by other birds;
for we could plainly see that a deep narrow hole had been
excavated by the hen, in which the egg had been dropped in an
upright position, and that the lower part of the egg did not touch
the bottom of the hole, as it was quite white, whilst the upper
half was soiled and stained, where the material had been
stamped oil to it.
After a few more moments search we were delighted, and
not a little astonished, at coming across a pretty chick, who
winked and blinked on having the bright sunshine suddenly
turned on to it. It was of mouse colour, inclining to yellow on
the head and underparts, whilst the red skin on the head and
upper portion of the neck was distinctly visible through the
scanty covering of bristly down, and at the sides of the face the
hair was so thin as to almost appear bare, the ears being plainly
visible.
The flights, in this chick, were nearly three inches long,
and, as the bird could fly fairly well, I have come to the con-
clusion that the young remain at least thirty-six hours, if not

longer, in the mound before making an appearance, as the three
others, which hatched in the incubator, were not nearly so
advanced when hatched. The beak and feet are strong, of a
dark horn--nearly black--hue.
The young have the same digging propensity as the adults,,
and nothing pleased them so much as a heap of peat, upon which
I scattered their food ; for they picked up quite large pieces with
first one foot and then the other, throwing them backwards in
order to get at fragments of food which had fallen between the
lumps. They invariably commenced with the left foot, and
would rarely touch the food on the flat ground whilst there were
any particles left on the peat.
Their pugnacity is evinced at an early stage. The day
after the first chick made its appearance a second hatched in
the incubator, which, when dried off thoroughly I placed with
its elder relative, who immediately dropped its wings into a
fighting attitude and pounced upon the new arrival. They soon,
however, got to be good friends.
After finding the chick, we decided not to go any further
with the e-xcavatiou, thinking it would be more interesting to
have the young emerge from the heap themselves ; so we replaced
the material, and left it as near as possible as we found it.
After waiting another fortnight, and no more chicks-
appearing, I decided to thoroughly overhaul the mound.
Almost the first thing we came across was a dead young one,
which caused us to come to the conclusion that the density of
the materials had prevented it finding its way out, and that the
remainder of the eggs had better be removed to an incubator.
Seven of these were discovered, two of which, containing living
embryos, were unfortunately broken in unearthing. Of the
remaining five two hatched and three were addled.
To emphasize the fact as to the thinness of the shell, I
may remark that the young ones do not chip round the upper
part of the egg when emerging, as is the case with other
gallinaceous, and most birds, but appear to give a violent wriggle
and shatter the whole shell, although they still remain encased
in the inner membrane, which is not torn open for some hours
afterwards.

296 On the Hatching &amp; Rearing of the Brush Tin keys at the Zoo.
When first hatched the primaries and secondaries of the
young are encased in a thin filmy covering, which gives the wing
the appearance of being full of blood feathers or quills, but
directly the chick dries this membrane peels off, leaving the
bird ready for flight.
Those hatched at the Zoo did not appear to be great
eaters and they were supplied with a variety of food, such as
hard-boiled egg, crissel, chicken meal, ants' eggs, dried flies,
boiled potatoes, boiled rice, boiled carrots, groats and grain, of
all sorts, both dry and soaked. They were fond of lettuce,
watercress, and grass in seed, but evinced the greatest partiality
for chopped onions. When large enough they were removed to
one of the pheasantries where they do well, and are constantly
catching flies on the grass or rushing up and down from one
*end of the place to the other in a state of great excitement.
They like to roost as high as they can get, and the gravel paths
in their enclosure are frequently turned upside down by their
powerful--although not clumsy--feet. At three weeks the black
feathers are distinctly visible through the down, and at six the
birds are a repetition of the adults, although smaller, and the
yellow wattle at the base of neck can be plainly seen.
Respecting the dead chick in the mound, I may say that a
week before we opened it the cock was seen to be in a great state
of excitement, and constantly putting his head into a deep,
narrow cavity ; so I have come to the conclusion that it was
about time that the young one hatched. And with regard to the
theory advanced that the male bird tests the heat of the mound
by putting his head, bare neck, and wattles into the mound, I
am rather inclined to think he only does this when the eggs are
due to, or have hatched, and that it is from parental affection,
or anxiety for the 3&amp;apos; r oung, as in both cases where chicks were
found--living or dead--a narrow opening leading from the }&amp;apos;oung
ones to the upper exterior portion of the heaps, was noticed, and
although the} r are particularly silent--only emitting a slight
grunt at times--the cock can probably hear some movement in
the egg, which either causes him to open the mound when the
\0x25A0chick is ready to emerge or to further energetic repulsion of
intruders.

Next season, if all is well, I hope to have thirty or forty
sacks of dried leaves ready for them, in which case the little
ones may be able to find their way out of the mound without
human assistance. Of course a dry season is most essential and
a lot of rain very detrimental.

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
I11 Trinidad there is a certain little brown fish called the
Cascaladon, possessing a flavour of the most subtle, entrancing,
and captivating description. So much so, indeed, that it is said
if a man eat of it, he shall never leave again Trinidad. None,
having once partaken, are able to tear themselves away from the
fish. All the helpless creatures can do is to succumb, and live
and eat and die within reach of it.
That is much my present position. Some two years ago I
was reluctantly compelled to give up birds--as I then thought
for ever. So certain was I of this, that I not only sold the birds,
but even pulled down the aviaries, on the principle, I believe, of
removing temptation ; and yet here I am to-day, with bird fever
as bad as ever. I am beginning in a very humble way, with
only just a few pairs; and yet I am just as keen to begin as a
heifer is for salt; but still I bear in mind the old Batin motto,
Festina lente-- Go slowly. In getting together a collection of
birds you must bide your time and watch your opportunity.
Dimidium facti , aui bene cepit , habet. This is not intuitive
wisdom 011 my part, but is gathered slowly and painfully among
the thorns of experience.
Now in starting to keep birds afresh, I find one of the
greatest difficulties is to secure pairs. Man is sent into the
world unfinished. Nature seems to say to him, "You are in-
complete : I have made the other part of you, but I do not
remember where I put it: you will have to hunt for it." It is
much the same with birds--the pairs are there if you can only
find them.
Presumably the White-crested Jay-Thrusli (Garrulax leucolophus) of the Himalayas.--E d.

On White-crested Thrushes.
One day during the recent Whitsuntide holidays, I took
my j^oungest boy to Hull for the da}&amp;apos;-, and while there called
upon a certain well known bird dealer to see what he might
have on hand. Amongst other birds I noticed two White-crested
Thrushes in a big cage. These the dealer declared to be a pair ;
but 011 this point I felt like Hans Breittmann, ' skebdigal,' as the
reputed lady kept on the bottom perch, like the immortal Mrs.
\0x25A0Gummidge, in a very forlorn and subdued manner. However,
the dealer being a good sort, although still standing stoutly to
his own opinion, offered to allow me to take the birds home and
try them in an aviary. I gladly acceded to the offer; only to
find my judgment instantly confirmed ; for the reputed lieu
spent its whole da\r in seeking first for one city of refuge and
then another, and to save her life I had to move her to other
quarters. It was now a question once more of Cherchez la
femme.
Happening to write to a bird friend, announcing my return
to the ' birdy world,' and asking him if he had anything he
could offer me, he returned a long list, and amongst them I saw
a Crested Indian Thrush scheduled. I accordingly wrote off for
it on the chance it might be a White-crested Thrush and a lady.
A few days later the bird came to hand, and whatever else it
might claim to be it certainly belonged to the ragged regiment.
I felt sure however at the first glance that I had got a hen,
and my private opinion was at once confirmed by the cock when
I introduced the stranger, for after contemplating each other for
a moment with the most offensive curiosity, they went into a
perfect shout of welcome. I think the cock's shout was one of
astonishment! The hen was perfectly naked from the middle of
the breast, and to increase the grotesque effect she had three
broken and disjointed feathers in her tail. However, the
gentleman apparently considered that half a wife was better
than none, and very soon they were seated amicably side by side.
The enjoyment of female society, like other things, depends on
the scarcity.
I feed the Thrushes on my own mixture--which of course
I think the best in the world--and a fair supply of mealworms
and blaclcclocks. The poor clocks have a bad time. Each leg is

chopped off scientifically before the body is swallowed. The
Thrushes are evidentl} 7 vivisectionists 011 principle--much like
the old lady who, after listening to a very violent anti-vivisec-
tionist sermon, remarked: "It is perhaps all true, but I must
confess that I like to eat oysters alive " !
I cannot say that the Thrushes are ' sweet singers,'like
David. Their voices are loud and insistent. If any fresh food
is put into their dish they exclaim at the top of their voices :
Pozu, poiu, pow pozv -- pow, pow ; reminding one irresistibly of
Haydn's remark on hearing the singing of a Presbyterian
congregation--" Ach, Gott is merciful!"
In appearance my friends are of a plain and sober garb :
dressed in russet brown, with white heads and waistcoats, and
elongated black eye patches. They have a curious habit of
playing leap-frog over each other's back sideways--a most
comical sight.
I am in good hope that someday they will enable me to
win another medal, but at present they are recuperating. They
are most amusing birds to watch and are great bathers. I have
written this paper to let my fellow members know that I am
once more on the war path and very much alive, and I make no
sort of doubt but that I shall find that before so very long I
shall be able to say of bird keeping, what Napoleon once said of
war: " Eh, bien ! C'est un grand jeu--belle occupation ! "
STRAY NOTES.
I11 the Zoologist for June last Mr. J. H. Gurney publishes his annual
*" Ornithological Notes from Norfolk," andrecords the fact ofa Pekin Night-
ingale (Liothrix lutea) having been shot at Holkliam on the sixth of Novem-
ber last. It is a great pity that any brightly-coloured bird that is seen in this
country must be immediately shot. Liothrix lutea is a species that might
do very well if established in this country, and there could be no objection
to it on the ground of upsetting ornithological records, for it is impossible
for it to come here on its own account. We are told that the specimen
above referred to "showed no signs of confinement," but it should be
remembered that the present day method of keeping birds in large aviaries
*ensures their plumage and general appearance being quite as perfect as
that of the perfectly wild bird.

Mr. St. Quintiu contributes the following note to the Field of June
2nd, on some Hybrid Blackgame and Grouse, hatched in captivity:
" Hybrids between Blackgame and Grouse occurring in the wild state
must be more common than most people might suppose, for Mr. J. G.
Millais, in his work on British Game Birds, speaks of having examined
some twenty specimens. Probably most of these were wild-bred animals.
I have just succeeded in hatching, but, alas ! not in rearing, a brood of these
hybrids in confinement. Having two tame hen Grouse but no male, I
inclosed a fairly tame Blackcock with them this spring, and presently one of
the Grouse went to the nest and laid seven eggs. I made the mistake of
removing them to a common hen when chipped, substituting three Pheas-
ants' eggs at the same time. Three of the Grouse's eggs hatched ; one was
promptly crushed by the lieu selected for her supposed gentle nature, and
one of the remaining chicks lived only for a day, never really feeding
properly. The survivor, with a small brood of common Pheasants slightly
younger than itself, lived just a week, and as it fed freely upon fresh ants'
eggs and chopped egg etc., I hoped it might have been reared. However,
it was found dead one morning, and with its poor brother (or sister) has been
committed to spirit with a view to closer examination. I may here notice
that, as in the subject of Mr. Millais's illustration killed in Inverness-shire,
my birds took after their male parent in respect of the toes, which were
quite unfeathered. The Grouse has proved an excellent mother to the
young Pheasants, and I greatly regret that, from excessive anxiety, I did not
leave her own eggs to her care. Curiously, the other hen Grouse shares in
the brooding, and the chicks are often divided between the two old birds.
I have several times seen the foster nurse brooding the three chicks, while
the bird that hatched them sits on some hurdles close above them, as if on
guard."
I11 the same issue of the Field appears the following note which is of
great importance from an avicultural point of view, as it was supposed that
the young Weka at the Zoo, was the first hatched in captivity in Great
Britain.
Mr. Charles Langham, of Tempo Manor, co. Fermanagh writes:
" I have kept Wekas in confinement for some years, and they have
successfully reared from twenty to thirty young ones to maturity. My
first pair I bought from the London Zoo., and placed them in a small grass
inclosure 011 the margin of a lake. They had plenty of covert and could
wade about in the water, which they were very fond of doing; they almost
immediately started to build a nest in a box provided for the purpose, and
soon laid three eggs, only one of which hatched; but this they reared
without any difficulty. I then placed them in a larger inclosure under
some beech trees, and they reared many young ones, turning over the dead
leaves and digging with their powerful bills for worms to feed their young

with. They generally begin nesting about February or March, but the eggs
then seldom hatch, owing no doubt to frost and cold. I usually remove
these eggs after about a month's incubation, and they start again shortly
and generally rear three or four young out of five or six eggs laid. When
the young ones are nearly full grown I remove them from their parents, as
I find the old ones are apt to kill them then. They usually bring out two
broods every year besides the first nest. I find it almost impossible to keep
more than one adult pair together, as the}&amp;apos; fight desperately. They are very
savage with birds of their own size or under, even killing nearly full grown
Pheasants. I once saw a cock Weka Rail go up to a good sized cock
Pheasant take him by the back of the neck, drag him to the water and
drown him. I feed my Wekas on raw bullock's liver, together with corn,
bread and scraps, but they get a large quantity of worms and insects for
themselves in their inclosure. They even kill small wild birds that come
down to feed with them. They make a large nest of moss sticks and
fibrous roots, generally under the root of a tree or under some faggots
which I provide for the purpose."

By far the most important event since my last notes were
written is the hatching of three young Crested Screamers on the
,5th of July. As before stated, these curious birds have probably
never nested in captivit}*- before, and very little was known about
their nesting habits. The incubation period is now known to be
\0x25A0six weeks ; the young are clothed in yellowish down, and except
for their small beaks and large feet, are not unlike young
goslings. One of the chicks was trodden upon and killed by its
mother, and an opportunity has thus been given to the authorities
*of fully examining the structure of these birds when newly
hatched, and it is to be hoped that a definite conclusion may be
arrived at as to the position these unique creatures occupy in the
Order of Birds. A full account of the breeding of these birds
with illustrations of the young will doubtless appear in the
Proceedings of the &amp;apos;Zoological Society.
Two hybrid Rheas, between the Common (&lt;J) and Darwin's
\0x25A0(?), have been hatched in an incubator, and are doing well. A
Globose Curassou has nested in a willow tree in the large aviary
near the Pelicans, and had laid two eggs when I last heard from

SINGING-FINCH.
Sir, --I bought from Mr. Hawkins, of Bear Street, Leicester Square, a
pair of Grey Singing-finches last August, and kept them during the winter in
separate cages. Whenever they were placed close together the cock bird
grew very excited and clung to the bars nearest, singing most sweetly to his
dear little mate, who would listen with her little head cocked on one side.
In March I let the cock into the cage in which was the hen and a
number of Waxbills. The Singing-finches at once seemed desirous of
building a nest, which they did. Three Silverbills were very naughty and
pulled all the materials about, and ended by all three promptly occupying
the nest, so I thought I had better isolate the Singing-finches.
I placed them in a breeding cage and hung a nest on the outside of
the cage and gave them some thrums. They at once commenced to build,
making the neatest nest I ever saw, and laid four eggs. The little hen had
great difficulty in laying her first egg, I thought I was going to lose her:
she sat such a pathetic little puffed up ball all day, the cock hopping around
trying to make her take food. The next day she still had not laid her egg,
so I gave her one drop of castor oil, but it had no effect; then I gave her
sponge cake soaked in sherry, after that she soon laid her egg.
Three of the eggs were duly hatched on the twelfth day. I had been
giving the birds Mr. Hawkins&amp;apos;s egg food slightly moistened, and this they
gave readily to the young birds. All went well until the eleventh day, and
when I came down at 6 a.m. I found, to my horror, two dead birds in the
nest and one dead on the floor of the cage with a hole pecked in it. I
wondered if the cock had grown tired of feeding his babies, or wanted to
go to nest again ; however, I resolved if there were more eggs I would
separate the cock from the newly-hatched birds.
In April four more eggs were hatched and I took the cock away at
once. For three days the little hen did bravely, but I thought the strain
was too much for her: they were such tiny helpless things, and she had
quite a difficulty in getting them to hold their heads up, so I thought if I
tied the cock's little cage on to her cage he might feed her through the
bars, and it would cheer her up. The plan worked very well, and she was
much more brisk; but, alas, on the ninth day she gave them all seed, and
I discovered the chicks all dead in the nest, their throats swollen and the
poor little hen in a great state. I felt very upset, as I had been constant in
my care of them, giving the birds freshly-mixed food every two hours, as
they seemed to like very small quantities at a time, and it soon grew dry.
I put them both into my flight cage with all the other birds, but the

little lien never seemed to get over lier second loss. She would not have
anything to do with her husband, but nestled up to a placid old Spice-bird,
who used to mother her a great deal, and at night they would squeeze up
so tight against each other they looked one bird. The little lien grew
puffier and puffier and thinner and thinner and very tame, until at last she
died on the 9th of June.
Could anyone tell me if they have experienced any such difficult)' in
breeding this particular finch, and if I ought to have given different food ?
I do not feel inclined to try again.

PARRAKEET NOTES.
Sir, --You will be interested to know my Yellow-rumps have a nest
of young (two or three) they are now about nine days old and I hope I shall
be able to rear them. I had a nest of three young Turquoisiues, but the
old ones left them one night before they were feathered properly and they
all died. The Blue-banded, Bourkes, and Alexandras are all doing well, the
latter laid a clutch of four eggs, but I took them away.

THE MANY-COLOURED PARRAKEET.
My old pair of Many-coloured Parrakeets ( Psephoius multicolor),
which have now been in my possession for about five years, have reared
three fine young birds again this year. The hen went to nest in March,
laying three eggs, all of which however proved to be clear. Like a sensible
bird she decided to try again, with the result that all three eggs of the
second clutch hatched, and the three young birds left the nest on June
23rd. Last year all three young birds reared were hens, but I am glad to
say one of the present brood is a cock, and a fine fellow too.

The following reply has been sent to Mr. Rathborne:
Mr. C. Chubb of the Natural History Museum writes to me as follows r
" The bird you sent is a Finch-Lark [Pyrrhulauda verticalis ) and most
probably comes from South Africa. It does not show any sign of a vertical
spot, but we have specimens in our series just like it : it is perhaps rather
a young bird."

BREEDING ST. HELENA SEED-EATERS.
Sir, --As-my St. Helena hen Seed-eater is sitting, I should be much
obliged if you would kindly let me know whether, when young arrive,
ought one to give anything extra beyond their ordinary' food to help them

millet, and there is a small plot of grass.
Nicholas S. O'Reieey.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. O&amp;apos; Reilly.
When breeding, the St. Helena Seed-eaters should be supplied with a
mixture of sweet biscuit, preserved yolk, and ants' eggs; also cliickweed
and groundsel. Being Canaries, they require much the same treatment as
the domesticated Serin. If you can get a few small smooth green cater-
pillars they will be appreciated. A. G. BuTEER.

Reply to a letter received, from a Member in the United States :
The most profitable large birds to keep for park aviaries are the
various Pheasants, which are also very hardy; but the different kinds must
be kept separate if you want to breed from them. For an attractive show,
a number of cocks of different kinds may' be put together, but most people
would rather breed them.
Along with Pheasants, you can keep and breed Doves, large Finches,
Parrakeets, and, if you have a small pond in the aviary&amp;apos;, refreshed by a
stream so as to prevent the water getting foul, some of the surface-feeding-
Ducks.
Cranes are rather large for aviary birds, and are better kept wing-
clipped or pinioned in a large paddock with a pond, and a warm sheltered
shed for winter use. With these, however, breeding is not certain.
Cockatoos have seldom been bred in captivity, and, like all the
Parrot tribe, are destructive to vegetation, but they are very attractive in a
big aviary, and will sometimes breed.
I cannot say what the prices of birds would be in the United States;
you can find out what they cost here by consulting the advertisements in
this Magazine or the Feathered World.
For a big public aviary you would find the following collection very&amp;apos;
striking, hardy&amp;apos;, and likely to breed, and not unduly expensive. Gold

foreign to you; and of vonr native birds, Passenger Pigeons, Carolina
Parrakeets, Wood-Ducks, and Red Cardinals. As the first three of these
last have got so scarce, all American public collections of live animals
should make a point of breeding as many as they can, to save the species
from extinction.
All those I have named are grain and seed-eaters, but if you care to
go in for fish- and insect-eaters as well, you will find Jaj&amp;apos;s, Choughs,
Troupials, and the smaller Gulls, Herons, and Ibises most attractive
additions, but as some of these would be destructive to eggs and young
birds, the breeding results might not be so good.
About the best Crane is the Demoiselle, of the Old World, but your
native White and Sandhill Cranes are nice birds, and with these you might
associate Peafowl, Silver Pheasants, Sheldrakes, and Geese, all of which are
suitable for paddocks. Swans and Flamingoes are good if you have a large
sheet of water. F. Finn.

the subjects for coloured plates for next year. It is desirable to illustrate
only such birds as have not before been well figured, or of which good
figures are inaccessible to most people. All suggestions received will be

THE SOCIETY'S MEDAL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980353625" page_id="32959036"  page_num="Page 308" year="" vol="">
A medal lias been awarded to Miss R. Alderson for having
successfully bred the Rufous Dove, Leptoptila reichenbachi, and
to Mr. D. Setli-Smitli for having successfully bred the Brush
Bronzewing Pigeon, Pliaps elcgans , both for the first time in
the United Kingdom.*
Mr. D. Seth-Smitli has reared young of the Scaly Dove,
Scardafella squamosa , 'and of the Tataupa Tinamou, Crypitirus
taiaupa, and accounts of both are now published. It is believed
that both of these cases are the first on record for the United
Kingdom, and the Council propose to award a medal in each
case. Any member or reader knowing of a previous case is
requested to communicate without delay with the Hon. Business
Secretary.
* We hear that Mr. Castle-Sloane has also bred the " Rufous Dove," but the young&amp;apos;
were not hatched until June 6th (Miss Aldersou's having left the nest on May 13th), and
Mr. Castle-Sloane is not quite certain of the species to which his Doves belong.

RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gnx, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Brown Own (Mr. Cuslmy). [Your bird died of congestion of the bowels, in
my opinion, brought on by indigestion from the want of a larger
proportion of natural food. The carnivorous birds, especially Hawks
and Owls, when young require a plentiful supply of small mammals
and birds. Your bird was terribly emaciated. It is supposed by some
to be a fallacy that it is necessary for these birds to have food from
which they can form casts, but if you will try the experiment of
feeding one on liver and muscular tissue only&amp;apos;, and another on small
mammals and small birds, the answer will soon be practically
demonstrated. Thanks for P. O. 2/6].
Two RosEbbAS (Mr. T. N. Wilson). [Birds are much emaciated and anaemic.
When purchasing new Parrakeets it is always well to handle them to
ascertain their condition. Should they be plump you are safe in giving
millet and canary with a moderate amount of fruit or green food, and
care should also be taken as to the introduction of grit for a while, as
they are likely to become ravenous after it. My advice is never to
purchase an emaciated specimen unless very much required. All such
specimens should be carefully isolated, and, if necessary, kept in a
warmed aviary large enough for them to fly about in. In addition to
millet and canary&amp;apos; a reasonable amount of hemp may be given, and some
species will eat flax seed with benefit, to which add dari, wheat, and
boiled maize. Many thanks for P. O. 2/6].
Paradise Whydah (Mr. A. F. Wiener). [Your bird died as a result of
brain pressure, caused by an extensive blood extravasation at the
anterior part of brain, immediately at base of beak and extending at
the back of the orbits. It certainly suggests a direct injury at point
of beak. Thanks for P. O. 2/6].

BLUF Rock Thrush (A. Trevor Battye, Esq.) [Your bird died of apoplexy,
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.993963" page_id="32959038"  page_num="Page 310" year="" vol="">
the blood clot extended over the whole superior part of cerebrum. It
is a great pity, as I think I never saw such a perfect specimen before].
Grey Waxbiee (Mrs. Hart). [Your bird died of pneumonia. You do not
sav if the aviarv is in or out of doors and you neither mention grit nor
crreen food in the diet. The pneumonia is caused by chill. Many of
these tiny mites when bathing, so saturate themselves that they
cannot dry before getting chilled and it is wise to prevent excessive
bathing until birds are acclimatized].
</bodyText>
<sectionHeader confidence="0.637687" genericHeader="method" page_id="32959038" page_num="Page 310" year="" vol="">
CORDON Beeu (The Hon. Lilia de Yarburgh Bateson). [Your bird died of
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939645" page_id="32959038"  page_num="Page 310" year="" vol="">
congested liver probably caused by chill. It is useless to attempt
treatment without correctly diagnosing the complaint].
Hen Caetfornian Quaie (Miss R. Alderson). [Bird was much emaciated
and suffered with a large abdominal tumor].
Grey Parrot (Miss B. Mortimer). The bird died of exhaustion consequent
on inflammation of the bowels. There was slight congestion of the
lungs, but death being so gradual, one would expect this from weak-
ness of the heart. You do not say what your mixed seed contained.
When purchasing a Parrot one should always ascertain how it has been
fed, and if any change is to be made it should be gradual. Your milk
and water and beef tea is undoubtedly a mistake. Fine oatmeal gruel
and a little brandy would be much better. Animal food in any form
is detrimental to seed-eating birds. Many thanks for P. O. 2/6].
Waxwing (Mr. P. W. Thornily). [Your bird died of inflammation of
liver. You do not state diet, so cannot advise possible cause].
Red-Faced love-bird (The Lady William Cecil). [Pneumonia was cause
of death brought about by chill. These appear to be extremely delicate
for some time after importation].
Zebra Finch hen (Mrs. Sherston). [This bird died of pneumonia].
Diamond Sparrow hen (Miss Goddard). [Pneumonia caused death,
contracted probably on the journey you mention].
Trumpeter Bueefinch (The Hon. Mrs. Drewitt). [Acute inflammation of
the bowels caused death].
Beack-Headed Gouedian (Captain Horsburgli). [Died of pneumonia of
long standing, the right lung being solid. The constipation was due
to the fever present. You could have done little or nothing for him].

WATKIN WATKINS, B.A. Cantab.
Member of the British Ornithologists' Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate's works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.' Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the 'feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
they are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not alreadv
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
' Summer is coming, summer is coming,
I know it, I know it, I know it.'
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe.
" Lovers and all in quest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of 'The Birds of Tennyson,' by Watkiu Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton, Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E. Lodge."--Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post,
" ' The Birds of Tennyson ' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought about
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly lie observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds. Excellent illustrations by

Excalfactoria .
There are few birds which give me more pleasure as an
aviculturist than the tiny Painted Quails; their small size, the
readiness with which they become tame, the free way in which
they reproduce their kind in captivity, and the ease with which
the young may be reared, all commend these beautiful little birds
to the consideration of aviculturists.
I obtained my first pair of the Common Painted Quail,
E. chineiisis, in the autumn of 1897, and have never been without
examples since, and I have also kept and bred the Australasian
form, E. lineata, so perhaps a few notes on these birds may not
be out of place.
The genus Excalfactoria contains, according to Dr. Sharpe's
Hand List , four species. All are very small birds, about five
inches in length. The tail is composed of only eight very short
feathers, which are entirely hidden by the upper tail-coverts.
The sexes are entirely different in plumage, and the males are
decidedly beautiful.
The common species, E. ckinensis, ranges throughout the
Indian Peninsula, Ceylon, and the Indo-Chinese countries. It
is also found in the islands of Formosa, Celebes and Ternate.
This species is well known to most of my readers, and those
who do not know it should refer to Vol. IV. (First series) p. 1,

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
where a coloured illustration of it is given. The plate does not
do justice to the subject, but conveys a fair idea of the birds.
The Australian Painted Quail, E. lineata , inhabits Aus-
tralia, the Philippines, Borneo, Java and Sumatra. It is slightly
smaller than E. chinensis , and darker in colour.
The New Britain Painted Quail may be distinguished from
either of the above by the absence of chestnut on the wing-
coverts, and by the underparts being almost entirely slaty-blue.
It inhabits New Britain, New Ireland, and the Duke of York
group.
Adanson's Painted Quail, E. adansoni , inhabits the greater
part of Africa, and differs but slightly in plumage from the
others.
It is with the common species, E. chinensis , and the dark
form from Australasia, E. lineata , that I have had some ex-
perience in captivity, and to which I shall chiefly confine my
remarks. I do not believe that living examples of either of the
other two forms have reached this country ; and I think that the
three examples--one male and two females--of E. lineata, that
I received from Australia in 1900, were the first, and perhaps the
only specimens ever imported.
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant considers E. lineata to be merely a
sub-species of E. chi?iensis; and probably he is right, though
observation of the two forms in captivity shows them to differ
considerably in some of their ways. The point which I think is
worth especial notice in this connection is the difference which
exists in the colour of the newly-hatched young of E. chinensis and
E. Ibieata, and one of my chief objects in writing this paper is
to call attention to this point, which I believe was never noticed
by ornithologists until I called attention to it at a meeting of
the British Ornithologists' Club in June 1903.
The young of the typical E. chinensis (Fig. 1) are like the
young of the Common Quail, only much smaller. The pre-
dominating colour is very dark brown. On the back are two very
distinct stripes of sand}&amp;apos;- buff, running from the nape to the tail.
The head is sandy buff, with two distinct stripes of very dark

brown. The throat is pale j^ellow, and the underparts yellowish.
It would naturally be supposed that the newly hatched chicks of
the Australasian form, differing so slightly when adult, from the
Asiatic birds, would be identical with the young of the latter,
but instead of being so they are absolutely distinct, being
almost entirely black (Fig. 2). On the head one can just trace
the buffish lines, which however are entirely absent on the back,
which is entirely blackish. The throat is yellow as in E.
chinensis , but the underparts are considerably darker than in
the typical form. *
The two forms interbreed perfectly freely, and the newly
hatched chicks, as might be supposed, are intermediate between
the two,--much darker than in E. chinensis , but showing faintly
the buffish stripes which are lacking in E. lineata (Fig. 3).
These hybrids, or mongrels, are perfectly fertile, which seems
to show that Mr. Ogilvie-Graut is right in calling E. lineata
merely a sub-species of the Asiatic form, though it is as distinct
from that form as, for example, is the Japanese Pheasant
(Phasianus versicolor) from the common Ring-necked birds
(P. torquahis). If only we could get living examples of
Excalfactoria adansoni and E. lepida we might be able to prove,
by crossing them with E. chinensis , whether they too would
produce fertile hybrids, or whether they are really good species.
It has been fairly proved in the case of the Pheasants that most
forms of Phasianus are merely local varieties or sub-species, and
this has been shown chiefly by crossing the different forms and
finding that the young are perfectly fertile however they are
crossed. It is reasonable to conjecture that the result of ex-
periments in breeding Excalfactoria would show that the forms
which are now regarded as distinct species are merely local
races or sub-species.
When acclimatised, the Painted Quails are quite hardy
and need no artificial warmth during the winter, if kept in a dry,
sheltered aviary. To breed them successfully, I consider that a
* It is perhaps worth mentioning that the male E. lineata showed no parental
affection towards his chickens; whereas the males of the Eastern form always, as far
as I have been able to observe, brood their offspring to the same extent as the
females, each parent, as a rule, taking charge of about half of the brood.

On the Painted Quails.
grassed aviary is necessary, although I have known a hen to sit
and hatch off a brood in a perfectly open, uncovered nest. The
grassed run need not be more than say eight feet square. The
nest usually consists of a slight hollow under a tuft of coarse
grass, slightly lined with hay. It is generally most cleverly
hidden, and approached through a tunnel in the grass. The
birds usually commence to breed in May. The clutch consists
of from five to seven eggs, generally five or six in the first nest,
and seven in the others. There are three nests in the year as a
rule, although a pair of E. lineata hatched four broods in 1900,
when only recently imported ; the last brood however were found
dead early one morning in October. They had been hatched the
previous evening, but had succumbed to a frosty night.
When hatched, the young Quails are very minute, about
one inch in length, and, as I have noticed on more than one
occasion, they are quite capable of getting through half-inch
mesh wire-netting. They run at once, and resemble tiny
animated balls of fluff.
Though so minute the chicks are easy enough to rear.
Live ants' cocoons are the very best food they can have, but
failing these almost an3^ good soft food that contains a good
proportion of yolk of egg is readily eaten. Very small gentles
are useful, though I have reared broods on the egg-food entirely.
Seed is eaten when the chicks are still quite small, and I have
found the small "Indian" millet very useful when they first
take to a seed diet. The chicks can fly at ten days old, and,
as was first pointed out by Mr. Meade-Waldo (cf. Vol. V. page 2)
at five weeks old they have assumed the adult plumage.

By Mrs. A. C. Charrington.
Leaving England on the 19th of last December, we went
by way of Cairo, Assuan, Wady Haifa, to Khartoum. There we
found a Government steamer, the " Dal," which was to start in a
few days for Gondokoro, the farthest navigable port on the
White Nile, and some 1,200 miles farther south.
In the Palace Gardens at Khartoum I made my first
acquaintance with the Whale-headed Stork (.Balczniceps rex) a
quaint bird with an extraordinary mouth which positively smiles
at times. The bird at the Palace has a Sudanese boy as
attendant, who feeds him with small fish, and if he does not
swallow them fast enough gently strokes down his neck with
anxious care ! The colour of this bird is a slate grey, as in a
Heron.
The " Dal," on which we started, January 15th, is the
same boat on which Lord Kitchener went to Fashoda during the
Colonel Marchand incident in 1898. In a barge alongside we
had goats for milk, poultry, and fourteen donkeys, the property
of Major Harrison, who was going shooting in the interior.
Two days south of Khartoum Ducks and Geese of many
kinds abounded, the latter mostly Spurwing (a). At Kawa
Major Harrison brought in a beautiful Roller with deep blue and
cobalt wings, soft blue grey head, and fawn back (p), also a
chestnut and black Whydah (e) with long hair-like tail-feathers
terminating in a spatule, also some small species of Hornbill.
Major Harrison was clever at skinning, and this gave me oppor-
tunities of seeing many birds which would not have occurred
otherwise ; as he was collecting for a museum.
The banks were dotted with beautiful water birds:
Crowned Cranes (the latter very tame and strolling along in a
most dignified way), Demoiselle Cranes, large and small White
Herons, a Grey Heron (?), Buff-backed Heron, and dense flocks
of Spurwing or Egyptian Geese ; in places a Whistling Teal (d),
and a large brown and black duck (?) were in densely packed

masses of several thousands, and rose laziljr, flying a few hundred
yards as the steamer came up with them; Sandpipers and
Curlews also abounded.
At Goz-abu-Guma the shallow water near the banks was
studded with large white water lilies, on and about which were
Coot-like birds with very long toes: Jacanas. A Darter was
added to the specimens on board, a curious Cormorant-like bird
that swims under water with only its head and neck out:
towards evening they gather in groups on the Ambatch bushes,
and stand immovable with wings outstretched as if to dry them
in the air. Beyond Renk, 280 miles south, the banks are fringed
with reeds and bushes which are hung thickly with Weaver-
birds' nests. A very brilliant Vermillion and black Shrike was
shot here (&lt;?).
About here we saw the most beautiful birds I think it
possible to imagine, called by Soudan residents the Ruby-
throated Bee-eater (f). I cannot find it mentioned in any bird
book. It is almost impossible to describe: a flash of pure
rose colour, bronze, dull red, and turquoise blue, changing and
shimmering with every movement, hovering over the reeds like
a dragon-fly, and every now and then settling for an instant on
a head of feathery papyrus. A Green Bee-eater is also plentiful
along the river, feeding on the insects that swarm towards
evening : one sees them in numbers where grass has been
recently burnt. The colour fades very quickly after death.
On January 21st we reached Tewfikieh, one of Sir Samuel
Baker's old stations, and walking along the shore I found Cordon
Bleus nesting in a yellow flowered mimosa. Spice-birds and a
glossy black bird, four or five together, like small Magpies, with
long waving tail feathers {#).
Major Harrison shot a large Pigeon, the size of a Wood
Pigeon. Breast steel grey, back warm vinous fawn, wings fawn,
shot with plum or iridescent green, flight feathers edged white,
distinct hackles fawn and grey, head grey, with fleshy eye ceres
bright red, an inch long and half an inch wide ; eye yellow (//).

on Some Birds of the White Nile. 317
Near the Sobat, which joins the Nile near Tewfikieh, we
steamed through a small flock of Pelicans which were almost too
lazy to get out of our way.
On January 24th we arrived at a place where the Nile
divides into the Bahr el Gebel and Bahr el Ghazal. We followed
the first river, and soon came to the district where the river loses
itself in immense marshes 40,000 square miles in extent.
The steamer threads its way through a series of lagoons
for about 25 miles, when the river again becomes visible. The
real river bed is being searched for, and cleansed of sudd, (a
vegetable block of papyrus and tall weedy grass), by two English
naval officers and a large number of natives working under them.
They invited us to join them on their gunboat for the day, and we
went through the newly-cleared channel with them. The last
few miles is not clear, and we had to charge several times at the
masses of floating sudd before it gave way, and was pushed
aside, or steamed over by our powerful stern wheeler. During
the day we saw many beautiful water birds, Brown and Black
Waders (/). Two kinds of Black and White Kingfishers
Pratincoles, and, most curious of all to see in Central Africa,
countless numbers of Terns, or Sea Swallows.
I saw one bird very like Balceniceps, but there is another
big-headed Stork in these parts. The bird I saw was flying,
and Storks are then hard to distinguish (k ). There seemed to
be four kinds of Ibis, black, white, black-and-white, and a
beautiful kind, white with just the edges of its wings black (/).
Some days after this while strolling on the banks while the
steamer was taking in wood for fuel, I saw Firefinches and many
Weavers. Nearly every tree had a pair of Fish Eagles nesting
on it. One shot and brought on board measured 6ft. between the
points of the outstretched wings (pi).
At Fado one touches Congo Free State territory, and the
Belgian Commandant, who is a great collector of birds, gave me
a pair of small Parrots, which I afterwards ascertained to be

Meyer's Parrot. I have got them safely home and hope they will
nest. As I write this they are moulting hard but are otherwise
very healthy. At Gondokoro, our farthest point, and the first
military station in Uganda, I saw very few birds. Spice-birds
nested in the thatch of the houses, and I saw one or two Glossy
Starlings. Returning down the river one sees much the same
kinds of birds. At Mongalla a pair of Yellow Wagtails had a
nest in the river bank close to my cabin window.
One evening as I was writing in the deck cabin, a bird
flew in, attracted I suppose by the light, and I caught it. It was
a beautiful Kingfisher, not larger than a Sparrow, chiefly golden
bronze in colour with a vermillion beak and a patch of bright
cobalt blue round and behind each eye (n). I put it in a cage for
the night, meaning to study the colours by day, but it escaped
through the bars of a primitive native cage. At a place about
12 miles up the Sobat, where we steamed to deliver mails to the
American Mission, we saw five or six immense black and white
Storks with bright red beaks ( o ). Close to them was a flock of
about fifty Guinea-fowl, much darker and richer in colour than
ours (/). The latter furnished a welcome change to our menu.
At one village we saw two half-tamed Ostriches kept for their
feathers.
At Gebel-Ain, 220 miles south of Khartoum, I saw several
pairs of birds which I cannot be certain were Doves or
Parroquets. I never could get very near them. They seemed
to fly about in pairs, the flight being like Budgerigars. The
general impression of colour was chocolate and black, with very
round bullet heads and curved beaks and long tail feathers (r).
Here too we got a beautiful Glossy Starling with yellow
eyes (s). It was wounded and I hoped to save its life, but could
not. -

By Dr. A. Q. Butler.
My attention has again been called to this important point
by my fiiend Mi. F. W. Frohawk's interesting article on the
sexual chaiacteis of the Lapwing Ibis,' Vol. IV., pp. 446-451).
As is well known to many of our Members, I have written
articles on the sexual differences exhibited in the wings of birds
both in ' 1 he Zoologist ' and in our Magazine.
As I have already suggested, every Museum should make
a collection of the expanded wings of all birds, in addition to the
collection of skins ; not only to enable the systematic Ornitho-
logist to see, at a glance, all sexual characters, and all important
generic differences which an open wing brings to light ; but to
enable him to describe his birds correctly.
A short time since, I lost a fine example of the Brambling
(Fringilla montifrhigilla $~) ; and, as I did not require the skin, I
cut off and mounted the wings. On comparing these with the
description of the Brambling in the Museum ' Catalogue of
Birds,' I at once noticed inaccuracies, which perhaps could
hardly be avoided by anyone describing from skins alone, but
which could not have crept into any description if open wings
had been available for comparison.
I should describe the wing as follows :--Scapularies and
lesser coverts bright tawny sienna ; median coverts white, all
the outer ones more or less washed with tawny ; greater coverts
black, the inner web somewhat greyer, the first tipped with
white, the second with white slightly washed with tawny, the latter
colour gradually increasing in depth of tint and width to the ninth,
when the inner web becomes white-tipped; bastard wing black
externally, dark brown internally ; primary coverts dark brown ;
quills with more or less black outer webs, black shafts, and greyer
inner webs ; bastard primary quite as well developed as in the
House-Sparrow ( Passer domesticus&amp;apos;) ; second primary with narrow
white edge to outer web ; remaining primaries with this edging
more or less interrupted and partly brimstone yellow ; the fifth to
the tenth with a conspicuous elongated white patch on outer web,

washed in front with sulphur yellow; third to fifth primaries
emarginate in front towards their extremities; second and third
primaries with ashy borders to inner webs excepting towards the
tips, the fourth to tenth with broad white borders to inner webs :
anterior secondaries with a tapering marginal white streak
towards extremities on outer web ; this streak becomes gradually
more tawny and encircles the tips in the posterior secondaries ;
in continuation of the elongate white patches on the outer webs
of the primaries, the secondaries show cuneiform white patches
faintly stained in front with tawny ; the narrow white and
sulphur edging to the outer webs in the primaries is represented
on the anterior secondaries by a broader (and shorter) streak,
which increases in width and gradually becomes tawny on the
inner secondaries, encircling the tips of the last three ; the first
six secondaries have broad white borders to the inner webs
excepting towards their extremities. Wings below grey, with
white inner borders to the flights ; under wing-coverts whitish,
becoming yellow at base of wing.
I think it will be admitted that in the dried skin it would
be hopeless to attempt to describe all these details ; and there-
fore once more I would urge upon our elder brothers--the
systematists, to delay no longer in adding as complete a series as
possible of sexed mounted wings to the collections under their
charge. I am quite sure, if they will do this, that many
unsuspected characters of importance will be brought to light,
which will be of assistance to them in their studies ; I am
equally certain that it will enable them to distinguish with ease
the sexes of many species which have hitherto been doubtfully
or even incorrectly determined by collectors and taxidermists.
Of course, in comparing some species, such as the
Dunlin, in which the wings of male and female are almost
uniform in size and structure, the weight and size of the bodies
must not be overlooked; the male, with its smaller body but
equally large wings has a great advantage over the female when
flying.

THE REARING OF THE SANDPIPER.
</sectionHeader>

By the Rev. C. D. Farrar.
To know just how good brandy is in a mince pie, you
must be a Protectionist. I suppose the zest of anything depends
on the deprivation if not on the prohibition. I remember that a
great traveller once said to me, that the much vaunted cataract
of the Ganges was a poverty stricken puddle, but that in a
country where there is no water, a puddle looked like an inunda-
tion. It is much the same with me at present. Having parted
with all my rare birds, I am for the present compelled to make
the most of what we will call the less rare.
For some odd reason chances do not come readily to those
who greatly desire them ; therefore it is no wonder that when
they do. we behave as though we were singing the song of
Hannah. I had much her feeling of exultation when one
summer afternoon in early July, I secured my family of Sand-
pipers.
They were "bred and born," as Brer Rabbit was so fond of
saying, on the banks of the Aire, but far far away from smoky
Leeds, and I fancy that when I have related all the circumstances
of their up-bringing the Council will feel that in very admiration
they are bound to make an exception in this case and award
me a Medal!
When discovered the little Sandpipers were barely out of
the egg shell. In fact they were not dry, and so tiny were they
that they looked like big bumble bees on legs. So feeble was the
spark of life that they had to be warmed in the kitchen oven, or
what Shakspeare calls :
"The vital spark of heavenly flame"
would have very quickly disappeared. There were three of the
little beauties and the mother also came to me, but we will not
say how. To have taken the babies and left the mother would
have been not only gross cruelty, but madness ; and I was going
to run no risks.
Whether my walk or their lives would end first, was for a
time a very nice problem. Fortunately, I managed to get them to

Rev. C. D. Farrar,
the fire , though not in quite the same sense as Cranmer once
used the expression. As I watched the poor little flicker of life, I
must confess that I felt a tightening of the heart and throat, the
sensation produced on some people by sacred music or the
shimmer of moonlight on the sea.
Presently beneath the grateful warmth, I could hear the
feeblest of feeble little pipes--Peep--Peep--Peep continually
repeated. For a long time life was at so low an ebb that they
could not stand.
As soon as I got home, I put them into one of my small
aviaries with their gentle little mother. It was the prettiest
sight in the world to see her call them and to watch them snuggle
under her just like little chickens do under a hen. She seemed
to know no fear, and might have been used to see a six foot
parson standing over her all her life. This is all the more wonder-
ful if we remember what a shy and timid bird the Sandpiper is.
Perhaps she was of the same opinion as one of my miners, for
he once said to me quite seriously, " Eh, Mester Farrar, but if ye
nobbut seed two cocks a fightin on t' road, yer heart 'd tak
part wi one o' them."
My heart certainly did go out to the brave little hen, as
she looked so sweet and confiding, with her soft brown eyes
fixed on me, as much as to say, I know you will see me and my
babies through this bit of bother. I had my doubts as to how to
go to work, but some doubts are like dirty water, let them alone
and they will evaporate. It was so in the present case. Had I
not reared other tender birds ; why then should I be beaten by a
nest of Sandpipers ?
Still the magnitude ot the task, as Mrs. Nickleby said on
another historic occasion--came upon me like a flash of fire and
almost froze my blood.
I knew very little about Sandpipers and their " little
Marys," but I judged that they would probably live on little fresh
water shrimps and such small deer as abide beside running
waters.
It was clear, however, that I could not get shrimps at

Micklefield, and the "pink un's" from Scarboro' would scarcely
do.
I felt that the only thing was to try various likely dainties.
The common or garden worm was an obvious thought. Away
I went and dug for dear life ; but as the ground was as hard
as a brick-bat, or shall we say--the heart of a brother avi-
culturist--the yield was not encouraging. I hurried back with
what food I could get, and laid them down with some ceremony
before the family. An Alderman at a City feast, if offered rice
pudding in place of rich Turtle, could not have looked more
disdainful. They simply did to the worms what the Israelites
did to Jericho--they trod them under foot. Here was a nice
predicament. Mealworms might do, but where was I to get
mealworms to feed a family of hungry Sandpipers in July? Only
a week before I had bought a quart at ten shillings, and was told
plaintively that " they was getting wery scarce." At the price
Sandpipers would soon literally be worth their weight in gold.
A buzzing bluebottle suggested the humble but succulent
maggot. I had a few. I humbly placed some on a saucer and
turned away my head. When I looked again a moment later,
they were gone completely, and the little Sandpipers were like
David Copperfield "plainly asking for more." More I could not
give them for my supply was very limited. I set about there-
fore and made them some food of my own, on the off chance
that they would take to it. Failing this, I determined to give
them their liberty, sooner than see them die before my eyes.
To my intense surprise they took to it most kindly, and when I
went to look at them in the morning, instead of finding them all
dead corpses, I found as merry a party of Sandpipers as ever
you saw.
The soft peep, peep, peep, never ceased for many days. I
suppose it is by the voice that they keep in touch with each
other when at liberty. After each feed they regularly ran back
to their mother for warmth, comfort, and forty winks.
For a few days the wire divisions seemed to puzzle them,
and they used to roam up and down as restlessly as some of the
beasts do at the Zoo.

On Rearing Sandpipers.
For some days they were covered all over with soft hair
like down and long filamentous particles where their tails would
one day be.
It was not for about a fortnight that they began to feather,
and it is only now at about two mouths old that they are begin-
ning to resemble the old bird. The sexes are easy to tell, as the
cock has a much whiter waistcoat than the lieu. They have long
been able to fend for themselves.
As they are Waders, I provided them with a small " Lake,"
made out of a disused scullery sink, and all day long they are
about in it, looking for imaginary prey. They love to bathe,
and when engaged in their tub they have a curious habit of
lashing the water up with their sterns.
I do not think they would hurt a healthy bluebottle,
unless perchance they ate him, but they have a habit of running
up to a bird with their necks stretched out very stiffly and
seizing him by a wing. The small bird merely looks at them
disdainfully and hops away, as much as to say What the
dickens are you trying to do ? "
They are the prettiest and daintiest little birds imaginable,
with their soft browny grey plumage ; snowy waistcoats and long
aristocratic looking legs, quite reminding me of some of our best
County families !
I love to see them moving about in a manner at once
indicative of quiet security and an untroubled conscience. They
only get maggots about twice a week now, and the other inmates
of the aviary have to be pretty spry to get any.*
We would especially urge members to send in accounts of
their breeding results during the present summer, and we would
also remind them that any notes on rare birds are at all
times most acceptable. No member need be afraid to write if
he or she has anything of interest to communicate.
* I gave tlie Sandpipers their liberty to-night, August 17th, on our "Cars" or
water meadows, not wishing to keep them all the Winter.--C. D. F.

Pternistes leucosepus.
By L. M. Seth-Smith, B.A., M.B.O.U.
The African genus Pternistes, of which there are nine
species, is characterised by the curious throat being entirely
devoid of feathers ; also the bare patch round the eye is large and
conspicuous.
Seven of the species have the feathers of the back and
scapulars with dark brown or black shaft-stripes, while the
remaining two have the same feathers with white- shaft-stripes.
The subject of this article is one of the latter class and
inhabits North-East Africa, Abyssinia, and North Somaliland ;
the other, P. infuscatus, being a more southern representative,
and inhabiting East Africa from Mamboia northwards to
Kilimanjaro and Southern Somaliland.
Mr. Ogilvie-Grant thinks it probable that the two forms
intergrade in Somaliland.
At the beginning of March, Mr. F. C. Thorpe, the well
known Hull bird dealer, sent me on approval a male and two
female " Abyssinian Francolins," which were in such splendid
condition, and such fine birds altogether, that I bought them,
although I had been told that Francolins are fearful screechers.
The plumage of the sexes is similar and the feathers
being white with brown margins, give the birds a very
speckly appearance.
The skin round the eye is bright red and very conspicuous,
and that on the neck light orange. In spite of the plumage
being similar, the sexes can be easily distinguished by the male
being considerably larger than the female and having a pair of
sharp spurs, sometimes supplemented by a second blunted pair.
As soon as I obtained my birds I put them into an out-
door aviary with some evergreen cover, of which they took full
advantage, being very shy. I planted turf also to give them
more cover later on, but they would not allow it to grow, eating
every green bitoff. They were fed almost entirely on malee,

which, though I believe usually very fattening, does not seem to
have hurt them in the least, which I attribute to the fact of their
having a good deal of room and being very active, continually
running backwards and forwards.
They are extremely fond of worms and scratch the earth
and grass up a good deal in their search for them.
Although living outside almost altogether, they had access
to a wooden shed with plenty of dry sand in which they delighted
to dust themselves. At first they agreed well together, but
about the beginning of April I noticed that the hens always
kept to their run on one side of the aviary, while the cock had
his on the other side and was very savage if the hens trespassed,
driving them away immediately. Towards the end of the mouth
they seemed to get on better however, but still there was no
grass and only a few nettles. In the next compartment, how-
ever, in which were some Rain Quails, there was a fine crop of
nettles, and so, on the 30th, I changed them round, putting the
Fraucolins into the run with nettles two feet high and the Quails
into the other. They seemed to like the change and very soon I
saw the cock coming through the nettles with wings drooped and
face inflated, showing off to one of the hens.
On May 7th I found an egg laid in a comparatively deep
hollow under some fir branches. There were a few pieces of
grass in and about the nest, but it could not be called a lining.
The egg looks at first glance a sort of dirty white all over,
but on examining it more closely it is found to be minutely
speckled with chalky-white. The crow of the cock has been
compared, not altogether inaptly, to the bray of a donkey: to me
it is not an objectionable sound. It has also several softer
guttural notes. But hard indeed is the aviculturist's lot! just
when things seem at their best and hopes are highest there comes
a blow.
The next day, May 8th, the hen was found to be egg-
bound. The miserably cold weather probably accounted for it,
but still I do not fancy it is common for so large a bird to be
egg-bound. I immediately took her into a warm kitchen and

treated her, and about eight hours afterwards she laid a thin-
shelled egg, and immediately after that was quite well again.
[My brother left England for Uganda early in June and
asked me to look at his Francolins wheuever I was in the
neighbourhood. I fear, however, there is not much to add to the
above notes. The hen that was egg-bound suffered from the
same complaint on two occasions later and was then removed to
another compartment.
On the 16th of July, in peeping through the wire I noticed
a batch of five eggs in a " scratch" under some branches in a
corner of the aviary, these having been laid by the second hen.
I did not see them again until the 7th of August, when there
were seven cold eggs in the nest, on which the hen had
apparently never attempted to sit. As they looked perfectly good
I decided to take them and attempt to hatch them in an
incubator. I fear, however, that having lain so long unturned
in the nest, there will be little chance of their hatching.

robustus&amp;apos;) received on the 14th of July are noteworthy additions
to the collection, for the species is very rarely imported, and has
not been represented at the Gardens for many years. It inhabits
South Africa but is a rare and local species.
The pair of Tickell's Ouzels (Merula unicolor) presented to
the Society by Mr. Harper in 1900 have nested in the new
Pheasantry. Three young were hatched but one died ; the other
two are doing well, and at the present moment (Aug. 20th) are
just about leaving the nest. The species inhabits the Himalayas
during the breeding season, and descends to the plains of India
during the Winter months. The pair at the Zoo. are probably
the only ones ever brought alive to this country, and the fact of
their breeding in the Gardens is a matter for congratulation.
The breeding season at the Zoo. may now be said to be
about over, and, so far as the birds are concerned, it has been
one of the most successful seasons on record. The credit for
this must go primarily to Mr. Bertling, the Head Keeper, who
has had especial charge of the birds.--D. S.-S.

The partial success of Mr. Blaauw in rearing young of the
Weka Rail (Ocydromus azistralis) in his Park at Gooilust in
Holland was referred to at page 277. Since the publication of
his notes on the subject in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society
(March, 1899) he has attained complete success, and we are
indebted to him for a copy of a paper read at the Zoological
Congress in Berlin in August 1901.
The pair of Wekas had been kept for some years in the
open, in an enclosure with growing plants. In the spring of
1900 they made a large nest of all kinds of vegetation, under a
beech tree, and both birds sat in turns on the three eggs, which
were whitish, spotted, and streaked with red.

birds were observed. These, two in number, were an almost
uniform chocolate brown, with black eyes and beak and reddish
legs and feet, and they were carefully fed and looked after by
their parents.
On the first day the young remained in the nest, but on
the second they began to follow the adults, who diligently
searched for food, which consisted of all kinds of worms and
insects. At first the whole family remained under the cover of
overhanging plants, but later they went more and more into the
open, and at length both old and young would run fearlessly out
when food was brought.
When the young birds were about a fortnight old the legs
began to grow very long, so that their small bodies were carried
remarkably high. Provision was thus made for rapid movement
at an early age. When about five weeks old the legs of the
young birds began to get yellowish, and soon became so alto-
gether. Feathers now appeared on the shoulders and sides, and
as no trace of a tail was yet visible they bore a superficial
resemblance to the Apteryx.
By July 26th they were fully fledged, although the feathers
were still short, and the legs became a dark red, the colour being
however still mixed with black. The bill was still black and
short, but it soon increased in length and became brightly
coloured, and in a short time the birds were fully grown.
The first plumage is similar to that of the adult; but the
black marks are less clearly defined, and the general colour is
darker.
Mr. Blaauw found the Wekas very tame, intelligent and
hardy, and possessing one fault only, namely, that they will kill
whatever they can master; on one occasion even killing a young
Rhea. However with an enclosure to themselves this bad
characteristic need not be taken into consideration.

Sir,--I n 1902 Dr. Butler wrote to The Ibis describing a very curiously
marked specimen of Gouldian Finch. At the present time there is a live
specimen at the Regent's Park Zoo. very like the one he mentioned. The
keeper (Insect House) tells me it is one of five which arrived in October
last in their grey nestling plumage, and that it has quite recently moulted
into the present colouring. WiqrjAM Ingram.
Sir,--T he accompanying letter from Sir Win. Ingram, Bart., is I
think of interest. My bird only acquired its deep colouring gradually,
during the last three or four years of its life; but the specimen now at the
Zoo. has assumed it as its first adult plumage.
It seems possible that such excess of pigmentation may be due to
unusual vigour resulting from a succession of unrelated marriages in this
bird's ancestry. A. G. BuTqER.

Letter received by a member from a taxidermist in Dunedin, N. Z.
To get live Owls is a much rarer thing than you are aware of. A pair
were sold a few years ago to a gentleman in England for #100. The pair
I have could not be sold under ^50. This bird is rapidly becoming extinct,
as the country is getting settled very fast. It cannot stand being disturbed,
and its food, rats, mice, etc. are getting scarce since stoats and weasels were
introduced. All the sheep farmers set fire to the native tussock grass, then
the ferrets, stoats, and weasels do the rest.
These birds have been in confinement for about five years, and have
laid each year. They were taken from the nest and are so tame that they
will allow themselves to be stroked, although they seem not to care for
such attentions. They are fed on steak, sheep's heart, or any meat not too
tough. In all cases I chop up the meat in small bits, and about twice
a-week I give a little bit of sheep's liver and lung. I have tried them with
birds, rats, and mice, but if I put in the usual little dish of chopped meat they
will never touch the others. They will eat almost any kind of tender meat.
I give them fresh meat every evening, and a large pie-disli of water : they
are fond of bathing, and cannot do without it.
In the southern part of N. Z.they inhabit the wild rocky sides of hills
where there is plenty of frost and snow in winter; here there are many

winters without snow, and as a rule the frost disappears by eleven o'clock,
but there is a good deal of cold wind.
They are housed in a very large packing-case, and inside there is a
small box where they stay all day or run into if disturbed in the evening.
We have got a small Owl here about half the size of the other, say
twice as big as a Blackbird; it is called the Morepork, which it calls out on
moonlight nights pretty plainly. It inhabits large trees so overgrown with
creepers that it is difficult to get its nest. It is not nearly so scarce as the
other. I think a pair might be got for #20, but it might take a year or
more to procure them. The Morepork is a great mouser, and eats moths
and such like : it is hardy in confinement and any kind of meat that is not
tough will do.
Both these Owls are a tawny brown. The large Owl has black eyes,
and the small one bright orange-yellow. In any good museum library you
can see in Buller's book (2nd edition, Vol. II.) a good cut and description of
both. ( Signed) W. Smyth.

Sir, --Referring to Miss Merrylees letter, I find the Grey Singing-
finch most easy to breed in a large aviary, and the young are reared
without any trouble. I notice that when the birds have young they pick
the green food over very frequently. I supply large bundles of flowering
grass, shepherd's purse, plantain (rats' tails), lettuce, cliickweed, groundsel,
and any plant or shoot from rose or fruit-trees that is infested with blight.
The Grey and Green Singing-finches I find cross very readily, the
young taking after the Grey, but generally shewing the dark clieek-mark
of the Green ; they are excellent singers. Are these cross-bred birds likely
to be fertile ?

THE DIAMOND DOVE.
Geopelia cuneata.
These beautiful and graceful little Doves do extremely well in out-
door aviaries in which there is plenty of cover in the shape of growing fir
trees and bushes or bundles of thick brushwood. In my own aviary
nest after nest is built and the young are reared without the slightest
difficulty. The nest is placed generally from five to ten feet from the
ground, and is made of very fine twigs and bents. It is difficult to say
exactl}&amp;apos; how many young have been reared this year, but I think ten or
twelve. I11 the winter the Diamond Doves certainly need warmth ; the
cold seems to paralyze them, especially the hens, and I used generally to
lose several before I had my aviaries properly warmed in winter.

Chalcophaps indica.
The breeding of this handsome species in captivity being, I believe, a
somewhat rare event, it may perhaps be worth while recording the rearing
of two pairs of "squeakers " in my aviar}\ The lien is a very old bird that
was given to me about two years ago by my friend Mr. B. Thomasset. She
had laid eggs while in his possession. Last summer (1903) I obtained a
mate for her--a very perfect and beautiful bird,--and she wanted to nest at
once. The new bird, however, was very shy at first, though he soon got
tamer. I11 the late autumn they nested, but failed to rear the young. In
the spring of the present year they went to nest again, and successfully
reared a pair which are now nearly as fine as their parents. A second pair
of squabs left the nest on August nth and are doing well.
The young birds are very small when they leave the nest, though
they fly well. The first time I saw one, perched on a branch of plum tree,
I could hardly make out what it was, as I did not expect to see the young
Greeuwings out so soon. Although the wings were fully feathered the
head was almost naked, and it looked a most peculiar little creature. The
plumage of the young is very interesting, and very different from that of
the adults. The feathers are very dark brown--almost black--broadly
tipped with reddish brown. Even in the nest however a few green feathers
are visible on the back and wings. The change to the adult plumage takes
place gradually, though somewhat rapidly, but in the first adult stage the
plumage is not so bright as in the old birds. Probably they wait until the
following spring for the brilliancy of maturity. I may mention that the
egg of this species is distinctly cream-coloured, not white.

Sir, -- I think it may be of some interest to the readers of the
Aviculiural Magazine to know that we have had a pair of Wliooper Swans
(Cygnus ferns), pinioned, on the lake here since the Spring of 1903. They
nested this Spring--began to sit on April 25th, and on June 6th hatched
four young ones. About three da}&amp;apos;S after three of them were found dead;
it is believed they got lost from the old birds who had been fighting, and
died of starvation--the remaining cygnet is thriving. F. Harewood.

Gouldian Finch, cock (Mr. W. F. Moore). Appeared ill some days. A
gathering like a blister was found on the left side of neck. This was
pricked and an oily fluid pressed out. It seemed better and was
replaced in a flight cage, but it died during the afternoon. Food
consisted of canary, millet, a mealworm occasionally, greenfood and
softbillo once a week. [Your bird suffered from a cyst 011 the side
of the neck, but this did not involve any important structures and had
nothing to do with its death. It suffered from fatty degeration of the
liver, which was the cause of death].
Bengalee (Mrs. Slierston). Had been rather puffy for a little time, but
sang and seemed all right. Noticed the upper mandible was over-
grown; would that prevent the proper cracking of seed? The bird
seems well-nourished, but it might have swallowed seed whole, and died
of indigestiou. [The upper mandible was overgrown, but the seed in
the crop was properly cracked. It died of inflammation of the liver].
ROSELLA Parrakeet, lien (Mr. D. Parker). Only seemed to be ill two or
three days, sitting moping 011 the seed-pan. Kept in a good-sized
aviary in company with another Rosella and two Redrumps. Food
consisted of hemp, millet, and canary seed. They had been in the
aviary about six weeks. [The bird died of inflammation of the bowels,
in my opinion brought on by chill. I should be inclined to add to the
food you now give, wheat, dari, and oats, and do not give too much
hemp. Many thanks for P. O. 2/6].
Budgerigar (Mrs. Williams). [Your bird died of concussion of brain].
*Orange-cheeked Waxbii.L (Mrs. Noble). No sj&amp;apos;mptoms. [Death was
due to acute pneumonia].
-ST. Helena Waxbii.L and Orange-cheeked Waxbill (Mrs. E. Mellor).

WATKIN WATKINS, B.A. Cantab.
Member of the British 07 &amp;apos;nithologists&amp;apos; Union.
" Many as are the volumes which have been written on different phases and aspects
of our late Laureate&amp;apos;s works, this, we think, is the first time that a whole book has been
devoted to "The Birds of Tennyson." Mr. W. Watkins, the author, is a member of the
British Ornithologists' Union, and has, therefore, a scientific as well as a literary interest
in the subject. And his verdict in the matter is this--that ' No poet is so satisfactory to
the ornithologist [as Tennyson], for no poet had a more accurate knowledge of birds or
had a happier power of describing their peculiarties.&amp;apos; Mr. Watkins' pages are, indeed,
themselves a testimony to the acuteness as well as the frequency with which Tennyson
described the ' feathered tribe.' All this, of course, is an old story to the students of the
poet, but it is pleasant to find Tennyson's references to birds collected and systematised as
thev are in this agreeable treatise, which is, as it should be, carefully and usefully indexed.
In his introduction Mr. Watkins deals with Tennyson's allusions to birds in general, and
in subsequent chapters discourses successively of birds of song, birds of passage, birds of
prey, birds of sport and so forth The result should convince those who are not already
convinced that as a poet of the birds Tennyson ranks with Shakespeare. Mr. Watkins, as
a naturalist, of course appreciates fully the poet's stanzas on ' The Throstle,' of which the
ignorant have been accustomed to make game. He recognises the fidelity with which the
bird's ' note ' is reflected in such lines, homely enough, as--
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.341264" page_id="32959083"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
1 Summer is coming, summer is coming,

</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.961563380952381" page_id="32959083"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
And he gives other instances of the poet's successful translation of birds' song into literary
speech."--The Globe,
" Lovers and all in qnest of unhackneyed forms of endearment could not do better
than add to their possessions a copy of &amp;apos;The Birds of Tennyson.' by Watkin Watkins.
The book is a well-compiled number of extracts from the poems of Tennyson, Wordsworth,
Shakespeare, Byron, Chaucer, Milton, Cowper, and other poets, in which the manners and
customs of birds are introduced as similes, in dainty lines. The volume contains some
excellent illustrations of birds by G. E- Lodge."-- Pall Mall Gazette.
" Mr. Watkins, who must have spent a vast deal of time in the study of Tennyson's
poetry from the natural history point of view, publishes a number of extracts, and enlarges
on them in a most interesting manner. Mr. Watkins' book should prove very acceptable
to Tennyson lovers."--The Yorkshire Post.
"'The Birds of Tennyson' should have a strong attraction, for its well-written
pages are a powerful proof of the great influence exercised upon the impressionable mind
of the poet by the beauties of form and the joyous songs of the feathered kingdom.
There is another class of readers who should also find much pleasure in a perusal of the
volume--those lovers of Tennyson as a poet who, not taking any special thought ahout
birds, will be astonished to find how much their favourite poet knew about them and how
narrowly he observed the life that moved about him. They will find, too, by the aid of
Mr. Watkins' comments as an expert, how appropriately Tennyson employed his innumer-
able references to birds of all kinds, and especially song birds.&amp;apos; Excellent illustrations by

THE ORANGE-BILLED TANAGER.
Saltator auraniiirostris.
By Arthur G. Butler, Ph.D., etc.
This, one of the largest but most sombrely coloured of
the Tanagridce, is an inhabitant of Paraguay, Uruguay, and the
northern and western portions of the Argentine Republic. Of
the few examples which have from time to time come into the
English bird-market, it is tolerably certain that all must have
been imported from Argentina; and that, previous to the
creation of our Society, these few found their way to the
Zoological Gardens of this country.
The Orange-billed Tanager appears to breed late in the
year; d'Orbigny having found it in Corrientes nesting in
November. Being a confiding species for a Tanager, it constructs
its untidy open nest of roots in the vicinity of human habitations.
The eggs are two to three in number, of a greenish blue colour,
slightly spotted at the larger end with blackish and reddish
zigzag markings.
In 1896, as recorded in the 4 Ibis,' Mr. J. G. Kerr
observed many examples of this and other species of Saltator
on a low-lying brush-covered island in the middle of the River
Paraguay, which it divides into two channels ; but he records
nothing respecting the habits of the genus.
The general colouring of the upper parts of the present
species is brownish ash washed with olive, the crown of the
head being distinctly darker and more slaty than the back,

Dr. Arthur G. Butler,
becoming in fact almost black on tbe forehead ; the sides of
the head and of the throat are black ; a broad superciliary stripe
which commences above the middle of the eye, passes with a
distinctly marked angle, behind the ear-coverts to the back of
the cheeks; in fully adult males this stripe is white above the
eye, in hens it is pale buffish, in }&amp;apos;oung birds fulvous; the
remainder of the stripe is rather more deeply fulvous at all
ages; the chin in adult males is more or less varied with white.
In male birds at all ages (not in adults only as was supposed)
there is a well-defined black gular collar uniting the sides of the
throat; the tail is slate-grey; the outer rectrices, apparently
only in old birds, more or less varied with white at the ends ;
the under parts from and including the centre of the throat
backwards, are of a dull rusty testaceous hue, the throat being
a little brighter than the breast or abdomen ; the breast in front
is also somewhat, smoky (which perhaps makes the throat seem
rather brighter than it actually is). The beak in young birds
is dark horn-colour suffused with leaden grey, but as the bird
gets older it gradually changes to orange-ochreous witli blackish
tip ; the culmen and one or two streaks on the mandible or lower
portion of the beak remaining for some time after the other
parts have become orange ; the feet are leaden grey ; iris dark
brown.
With this peculiar type of colouring, it is not surprising
that the late Dr. Russ should have regarded this and the other
species of Saltator as Grosbeaks, referring them to the genus
Coccothraustes; but why he should have applied to them the
misleading trivial name of "Parrot-finch" (Papagei-fink) is a
poser, unless the dentirostral character of the species suggested
the misnomer: he gathers from Burmeister and Frantzius that it
must have a lovely song.*
It would seem that Dr. Russ is not the only one who has
been struck with the Grosbeak-like aspect of this bird; for
three examples imported in September 1903, were regarded as
"American Hawfinches." My friend Mr. James Housden
* Mr. J. Graham Kerr, however (Ibis 1892, p. 125) says that it "utters a series ot
chirping notes of small range." Mr. W. Goodfellow (Ibis 1901, p. 472) speaks of Saltalot
tuperciliosus having a loud sweet song, uttered from the highest twigs.

secured these birds (together with a consignment of so-called
Brown-throated Cardinals, Yellowish Finches, and three Red
Oven-birds), and I considered myself fortunate in being able to
buy one of them: it was said to feed upon canary-seed only,
and had apparently been imported upon that diet; but, seeing
the Tanagrine character of the beak, I felt doubtful as to this
being its correct diet, and I soon discovered that it greatly
preferred soft food, fruit and insects, though it would occasionally
eat a little canary-seed which I scattered upon the floor of the
cage and sometimes would eat a few grains from a small pan:
all the seeds were husked in the orthodox manner.
Orange, ripe figs split lengthwise, ripe pears, and grapes,
were eaten with great relish. For soft food I gave my regular
mixture,--bread crumbs, powdered sweet biscuit, yolk of egg,
and ants' eggs; of this it ate moderately, but evidently preferred
it when mixed with grade i of " Century Food." In the matter
of insects it was not particular, leaving all other food to seize
cockroaches, mealworms, caterpillars, or the so-called rat-tailed
flies (Eristalis tenax) which buzz about the Michaelmas daisies
and closely resemble honey-bees : any of these it would take
from my fingers after its second day in my possession.
I suppose the unnatural diet upon which this bird had
been fed during its importation had sown the seeds of the
disease from which it eventually died, for two or three days after
the Saltator came into my possession I noticed that it became
sleepy and sluggish ; and although, by clearing my garden of
every spider I could find, and particularly the full-grown females
of our old friend the typical garden-spider (Epeira diademataj,
I restored it in a few days to apparently good health and increased
activity, it subsequently relapsed to such an extent that, although
it bathed regularly, it never took the trouble to cleanse its
feathers by passing them through its beak. Doubtless the chill
of the matted plumage, which naturally became clogged on the
breast with sand and juices from the fruit, accelerated the
progress of the disease, so that on November 4th I found it dead. 4 &amp;apos; 4

On the Orange-billed Tanager.
Being offered to me originally under tlie dealer's fancy
name of "American Hawfinch," it may be imagined that I
was at first puzzled as to what this bird was. As the form of
the beak and the bird's evident preference for soft food suggested
Tanagrine affinities, I waded through the Museum Catalogue
of those birds : I paused when I came to Saltator, but even the
description of S. aurantiirostris did not seem to fit it exactty.
I therefore wrote to Dr. Sharpe enclosing a rough coloured
sketch which I did from memory; I also wrote to our Business-
Secretary and Editor. All three gentlemen suggested that it
was probably Saltator aurantiirostris ; but, as I was still in doubt,
I went up to the Natural History Museum and had a look at
the series of skins.
I found that my bird was unquestionably a not perfectly
adult male of the Orange-billed Tanager, but there was only
one skin in the Museum which nearly approached it in colourings
all the other skins were paler and less brightly coloured, so that
the description in the Catalogue taken from these skins
necessarily gave me the idea of another, though allied species,
(tawny colours fade quickly) : but what put me off the track as
much as possible was the wording of part of the description,
which gave me the impression that the throat of S. aurantiirostris
was wholly black.
At the Palace Show in October, Mr. Housden exhibited
the other two specimens of this species, which appeared to be both
hens (the gular collar being absent) and Mr. Swayslaud brought
up one of four quite young males which he had recently received ;
and which, on account of their dark beaks he thought must
represent a distinct species : I was however able to assure him
that this was not the case.
Of all the Tanagers with which I have hitherto come in.
contact, the Orange-bill seems naturally to be by far the most
steady. Most Tanagers when first imported are more or less
wild and nervous, nor have I ever known them to become
thoroughly trustful; but S. aurantiirostris from the time that
I turned it into its small flight was perfectly friendly; and,
although at first it would fly up to its perch if I put my hand

in to renew its food, it eventually did not even trouble to do
this, but merely turned its head to see that I did not attempt to
take it out (as I had been obliged to do when Mr. Grotivold was
preparing its portrait). Always when I passed the cage it
would come to the front and look over to see whether I had
anything for it. It is a confiding disposition like this which
endears a bird to its owner, far more than mere brilliance of
colouring. Scarlet and male Superb Tauagers become fairly
tame in time ; but either docility is inherent in the Orange-bill,
or the poor feeding which the bird had experienced before it
came into my possesion served, by contrast, to render me a
particular benefactor in the bird&amp;apos;s estimation; yet even the
Cardinals brought over at the same time were marvellously
steady, so that I should rather be inclined to believe that the
importer was more than ordinarily gentle with his birds ; though
doubtless low feeding does tend to subdue living things.

By Dr. Albert Gunther, Hon. M. A vie. Soc.
On July 31st of last year I bought three young Red-backed
Shrikes. Being well acquainted with the general treatment and
feeding of this species in captivity, I had no difficulty in
rearing the youngsters; they grew into strong birds, became
very tame and confiding towards the people in the house, and
showed themselves always ready for a game, during which they
strike those peculiar attitudes so closely resembling the antics
of young Kestrels or Hobbies. Singularly, I never saw them
playing with each other in the same fashion ; on the contrary,
soon after they had commenced to feed themselves, and to
deposit food each in its own larder, their frequent quarrels
compelled me to separate them. * They had the strongest
objection to the approach of strangers and visitors, and one day,
frightened by a workman, two of them squeezed themselves
* I use for this Shrike an ordinary Thrush's cage with wooden bars.

Dr. Albert Gunther,
through the bars of their cage and escaped into the garden.
One returned on the evening of the same day, whilst the
other enjoyed its liberty for another day, when it demanded
readmission to the fleshpots of Egypt by flying against the
window, behind which its cage was still standing.
Late in the autumn they moulted, and proved to be two
males and one female. Already before the moult they had
diligently exercised their vocal powers, even the female at first
taking part in these musical efforts. However, she soon dis-
continued to sing, whilst the two males became in the end
accomplished songsters, mixing with their own notes those of
a Garden Warbler. Contrary to 1113' former experience these
birds did not damage their feathers by unrest during the period
of migration; the whole of their plumage remained perfect
throughout the winter, and in spring the lower parts of the bod\ r
of the males became suffused with a pinkish blush.
In the first week of May of the present &amp;gt; r ear I turned out
one of the males and the female into an aviary, erected
against the garden wall. Although open at the top and on
three sides it occupies a sheltered position, and with a height
of 6ft. it covers an area of 10ft. by 13ft. The half nearest
to the wall is planted with densely foliaged bushes, a thick
holly-bush among them. After a few days I noticed that both
birds had the feathers round the base of the bill knocked
off: I could never find out whether this injury was caused by
disturbance from a night-prowling cat which made them fly
against the wire-netting, or by their working and shredding the
dry rough fronds of pampas-grass. At any rate, it must have
been in the second week of May that they built their nest. This
was done entirely in the early morning hours ; the gardener saw
them then busy with carrying materials, but the operation
escaped me altogether, as I never visited them before eight
o'clock.
On the 22nd the prolonged disappearance of the hen-bird
induced me to examine into the matter. Then I found in the
most hidden and densest part of the holly-bush, four feet from
the ground, a well-built typical Shrike's nest with five warm eggs
in it. The first egg was probably laid on the 16th.

oh the Breeding in Captivity of the Red-backed Shi ike. 34
May 22nd to 28th. The lien attends most assiduously to
the duties of incubation, while the cock takes no part in them.
Twice only has she yielded to the temptation and come to my call
to receive from my hand her allowance of mealworms. Other-
wise she depends entirely on her husband who carries every
kind of food to her. But he exercises great caution in this,
never approaching the nest when he perceives or fancies himself
to be observed. Tame and without any fear as he is in his
intercourse with me, he never betrays by any action the presence
or locality of his nest.
The forenoon of the 27th must have been particularly
trying to the hen : a violent thunderstorm of two hours duration,
with torrents of rain broke over Kew, but she did not allow
herself to be disturbed.
May 29th to June 2nd. The storm of last week was
succeeded by some days of dull weather; the temperature fall-
ing to 48*, and rising at midday to 59 0 . The hen would not
leave the nest at all during the day, but I provided at nightfall
an extra supply of fresh food with mealworms and cockroaches,
which she would find in the early morning, beside the food
carried by the cock. This practice I have continued throughout
the breeding period.
On June 3rd the weather had improved, and noticing the
hen twice off her nest, I took this opportunity of entering the
aviary with the object of having a peep at the eggs. But the
hen foiled me both times ; she slipped into the nest before I
could reach it; and, moreover, the second time the cock made a
most determined attack upon me, inflicting a deep scratch with
his claw upon the side of my face. I tried to drive him off with
my handkerchief, but this made him still more furious, although,
fortunately for my face, the handkerchief became now the object
of his attack. My speedy retreat restored his equanimity, and a
few minutes afterwards when I offered him a mealworm, he was
as amiable as ever.
Five young were hatched in the night from the 5th to the
6th of June. The incubation px&amp;apos;obably lasted 14 days, the normal
period stated by all ornithological authorities. Wild Shrikes

Dr. Albert Gunther,
would now only commence their nesting operations, at least in the
Midland and Eastern counties. On the Stli there was again a
change of the weatlier for the worse ; a low temperature with
occasional cold showers of rain reminded one of March. Yeti
had no apprehension about the well-being of the young, as the
hen continued to cover them with scarcely any interruption.
She did not give me any opportunity of examining the nest until
June nth, when I found to my sorrow only two remaining in the
nest; the three others had completely disappeared, and a search
amoi^ the leaves and litter on the ground was without result.
On th !jext day one only was left, and on the 14th the last had
disappeared On a renewed search I discovered both at some
distance f 1 the nest, close together, with the scalp torn, but
without other injury; they were of good size, and had the head
covered with stubbles.
Of the conjectures as to the cause or manner of death, the
following appears now, with the light of subsequent events, the
most probable. The young perished from the cold temperature,
which supervened during the greater part of their short life.
The dead bodies were removed by the parents, those of the
tiniest were lost beyond recovery, whilst the oldest and heaviest
had their skin torn by the efforts required for their removal.
June 20th. The male renewed his attentions to the female
in a very conspicuous manner shortly after the catastrophe
related. His jealous conduct, whenever she attempted to take
her food directly from me, was most ridiculous to see. No
new nest was built; and this morning the old nest was still
empty. I left home in the afternoon, and returned on June 24th,
when I found the hen sitting ; she left after a little persuasion,
so that I could obtain a good look at the eggs which again were
five in number. They were more brightly ornamented than
those of the first clutch, the brown spots near the broad end
forming an almost confluent deep-coloured circular head.
The period of incubation passed under more favourable
meteorological conditions than on the former occasion. The
male kept the hen regularly supplied with food, which, however,
did not prevent her from coming sometimes to my call to receive
an extra supply of mealworms.

July 7U1. To-day the eggs were due to hatch, so I ex-
amined the nest in the morning, and found four of them
hatched. The fifth young appeared on the following da}&amp;apos;; it was
conspicuously smaller than the others, and survived one day
only. On the nth a second, also of smaller size, died. The
bodies of both were found at a distance from the nest, nearly
in the same place, quite uninjured.
July 8th to 22nd. In the glorious weather which we were
enjoying during this mouth, the surviving young made good pro-
gress. Both parents fed them ; their jealousy had much abated,
and they never resented my daily examination of the .t. On
one occasion I surprised the male quietly squ hg on the
margin of the nest, with food in his beak, and w ng until it
was demanded from him.
July 23rd. The excitement of the parents indicated some
unusual occurrence; two of the young had left the nest, and the
third followed later in the day. All were on the ground, making
their first attempts at locomotion, but in a more awkward or
helpless manner, than can be seen with Finches or Warblers
which have just left the nest. Whether this want of strength is
common to all Shrike fledgelings, or whether it is due to the
artificial conditions under which the old parents lived, I am
unable to say. Their wing-feathers were so little developed that
it took three days before they could manage to scramble again
into their holly-bush ; and the weaker of the three is still, after
six days, unable to take a flight, however short. Yet in all other
respects they show themselves to be healthy and in normal
condition. I was particularly pleased to see that their instinct
leads them during rain into sheltered or dry places. In the
night of the 26th they were exposed to the fierce downpour of
rain, which flooded London and the suburbs; and it was a great
relief to find all three well in the morning. Probably, the lien
afforded them some protection. The cock always roosts by
himself.
By August 2nd the)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; had made rapid progress in their
growth and strength, although a great part of last week was dull
and showery. The two strongest fly freely about for some
distance, and reach the top-perclies without difficulty ; occasion-

Dr. Albert Gunther,
ally they pick up food. In size they are scarcely to be distin-
guished from their parents, but their tails are onty half the full
length. The third is more backward, though apparently in good
health.
Aug. 9th. All went well during the week. If kept in a
cage by themselves the young Shrikes would now entirely feed
themselves, but as the parents seem to take special delight in
carrying the food, the young are never hungry enough to cater,
for themselves, although they pick up scraps which happen to
come in their way. In some respects it might be better now to
cage them. The hen is sometimes busy hunting for small earth-
worms, which she tears into smaller pieces to give to the young.
I have never before noticed a Shrike eating them. She also
confines her care in feeding to one of her children, the strongest,
which usually settles on a particular perch, whilst the cock
attends upon the two others which are of a more roaming dis-
position. I often witness the feeding during the day, but since I
observed the partiality of the parents to particular young ones,
I have never noticed a variation of this habit.
Aug. 14th. The young help themselves freely from the
dish containing the food for the family; but mealworms and
similar tit-bits are still carried to them by their parents. They
can be distinguished from the old hen by their lighter colour
only ; one, probably a male, exceeds its mother in size. The old
male has recommenced to sing, one of the young often sitting
beside him.
Aug. 28th. The parents have discontinued to feed the
young, and leave them entirely to their own resources.
The Butcher-bird sitting 011 the top of a hedge-row or
thorn-bush is a familiar object, and there will be but few orni-
thologists who have not seen its larder and are not otherwise
well acquainted with its habits and domestic economy generally.
But there are certain of its habits and traits in its character
which it would be difficult to observe in the field, and which in
my opinion render this species particularly attractive and full of
interest to the aviculturist. Some of its habits remind us of
those of the smaller Hawks : such as the manner in which it uses

its claws when striking in an attack upon an enemy or large prey,
or in which it uses them when grasping and holding up a large
beetle or bumble-bee whilst it is pulling the prey to pieces. I
have already mentioned the Hawk-like attitudes of the male
when he is inclined to play. While this species readily accom-
modates itself in captivity to associations with man, it never-
theless does not deteriorate in its natural character. No bird
is more observant of everything going on around it; it watches
and understands every one of your movements, every bird or
animal which happens to pass within the range of its keen
vision, betraying by an angry chatter the approach of a stranger,
a cat or a Hawk, whilst the members of the household, even the
dogs, are viewed with indifference or received with pleasure.
The birds I have at present readily come to the call, either to
receive food which they take from the hand in a particularly
gentle manner, or merely for the sake of amusement, for the
male likes to play with a finger held out to him, a stick, or
similar object.
The qualification of the Butcher-bird as a songster is of
no mean order, although I have never among English specimens
met with so accomplished an artist, as was a German bird which
imitated the song of a Blackcap-Warbler to perfection. My
male which is living in celibacy, has now continued to sing from
November to the end of August.
Whether other species of Shrike would make equally
attractive cage-birds, I have no experience. The Larger and
Lesser Grey Shrikes which I have kept, had previously passed
through hands, in which they had not the advantages of proper
treatment. I am now very anxious to try the Woodchat. To
domesticate Shrikes (if I may use that expression), and to com-
pletely reconcile them to life in captivity, it is necessary to take
them from the nest. Older birds never lose their natural shy-
ness, and survive the loss of their liberty for a short time only,
so that no attempt should be made to cage them. The young
birds reared in my aviary, were at first very timid, but by the
time they fed themselves, they came and took mealworms from
the hand, being nearly as tame as were their parents when of

the same age. If they survive till next spring (and there is no
reason why they should not) the doors of their and their parents'
cages will be opened at a place distant from London fogs and
cats, where they will find eveiy inducement to stay and pro-
pagate their species.
This report extends to a greater length than I anticipated,
but before concluding it, I may add a few words on the food on
which I found my Butcher-birds to thrive. I gave them a mixture
of dried ants' eggs, artificial food (Century or Abrahams',) mixed
raw beef and hard boiled egg, and finely scraped raw carrots.
The proportions of these ingredients vary at different times of
the year, and according to the state of health of the birds. At
times (for instance, during moulting or in very cold weather) the
supply of beef is increased ; when they are restless at night, the
vegetable substances are given in larger proportions, but at all
times dried ants' eggs are required to facilitate the formation of
castings which in Shrikes are as sure a sign of health as in
Hawks. When fresh ants' eggs are available, I give them mixed
with the dried. The birds receive, besides, daily from four to ten
mealworms, in addition to cockroaches or other insects, if such
happen to be at hand. With this food my birds, after the strain
of having had two broods of young in succession, are in as
health)^ a condition as they were at the beginning of summer.
They have never shown the least sign of impatience at
the confinement, in which they have passed the first year of
their life ; and I therefore feel all the more justified in recom-
mending this species to aviculturists, and hope that they will
derive from it as much pleasure as my birds have given me.

When our late Honorary Secretary kindly asked rue to
send an aviary letter to the Magazine, I thought it better to wait
until the breeding season was over and there was more to say, for
here we only keep a few birds. But meanwhile perhaps the
following remarks on the bad luck this year of certain of the
wild birds of our garden may not be uninteresting to some of our
members.
If it does not make this letter too long I may just sketch
the kind of country in which the garden lies.
We are on the slope of a hill which falls to the valley of
the Test ; at this point the river is nearly one hundred and fifty
feet above the level of the sea. A quarter of a mile below the
house the river runs, split here into two widely-separated chan-
nels, and receiving a considerable tributary from the Micheldever
hills. The valley below is all green and soft; water-carriers, bog-
lands and peat-holes are its characteristics, from the big common
of Bransbury above us, to Stockbridge, and further, below. Above
the house rise the high down-lands (now for the greater part
ploughed up) stretching away to Winchester and the Itcheu valley.
Across the valley the corresponding chalk hills range away to the
Berkshire border and the valley of the Kennett. These hills are
generally bare, saving for solitary clumps of beeches or some-
times of fir.
About two miles away lies a wood of some two thousand
acres--the remains of the ancient forest of Harewood, where
Daphne mezereum grows wild--and some of the landed estates
have fair-sized coverts; yet it is an open not a wooded country,
with an almost total want of hedgerow timber.
Of course each of these areas has its own distinctive
character of plant, insect and bird life. The down-lands have
their gentian, Chalk-hill blue butterflies, Wheatears, and Thick-
knee Plovers, and in the fir-clumps Long-eared Owls ; the valley
has its sundew, buck-bean, Ephemeridce , Water-rails, Snipe, Dab-
chicks, and Duck ; the great isolated woodland its yews, White
Admiral butterflies, Woodpeckers, Nuthatches, and Tawny Owls.

Mr. A. Trevor-Battye,
Here though close to the river we are quite away from the
woods; Snipe, Duck and Plovers cross the garden, Dabchicks visit
at night the little pool in the Flamingos' enclosure, but although
there are many big elm trees about the garden we never have a
Woodpecker there nor a Nuthatch, and the Wryneck is very
seldom heard. While the Great and the Blue Titmouse are
always with us (except in the month of August, when they dis-
appear with their young till the sunflower seeds are ripe), and
nest in the boxes, the Marsh Tit is very rarely seen in the garden
and the Cole Tit never.
Now for our run of bad luck. We have no rookery in the
garden and we want the Rooks to settle there. In the winter
they would come down close to the window and feed at the birds'
table. This spring, to our great delight, a pair came and built
a nest in the top of the biggest elm a few yards from the
house. The eggs were hatched, the young were being fed, when
everything unaccountably stopped. The old birds gave up com-
ing and the young ones died.
Once more we were doomed to disappointment. There
are Barn Owls in the thatched roof of the cottages ; we wanted
them near the house. We made an excellent loft for them
under the thatch of the seed-room roof, and fixed up two Owl-
boxes in the elms. A neighbour sent us last year a pair of Barn
Owls, with their two big young ones; the old birds were set free
and went straight off to their home three miles away, the j 7 oung
ones we kept in an aviary. Towards autumn they were liberated,
and fed from the roof of the aviary. They lived partly in the
seed-room loft, partly in one of the boxes in the trees. Thus they
flew at hack for some time, eventually catering entirely for them-
selves and leaving untouched the food we provided. They
ornamented the tennis lawns with many large castings--always
composed of mice and vole remains. Towards the end of April
and the beginning of May they were very interesting, and for
several days running came out for their evening flight just as we
were going in to dinner. One (perhaps the male bird) always
gave a loud screech as it left the box and then sitting on a dead
branch waited for its companion to join it. They used to beat
the garden and paddocks very regularly each night. They never

seemed to hunt the water-meadows, but always after they had
finished at home they moved off to the high down-land behind
the house.
Early in June they began nesting in one of the boxes and
as afterwards transpired laid six eggs.
Ours is a great bee country because of the good supply of
thyme and other bee flowers on the downs. There are many hives
in every village ; in one field not far off are over seventy hives in
a row. East year (1903) a swarm of bees took possession of one
of the Owl-boxes and gave us 25lbs. weight of pure honey. The
box was then unoccupied so it was of little moment. But,
again this year a strong swarm suddenly appeared in the air and
went straight into the box where the Barn Owls were with their
eggs. The poor birds remained in the box all day in spite of
their myriad foes, but with evening they could bear it no
longer ; and a little before their usual time both flew from the
box to return to it no more. When after much difficulty we had
removed the box and driven out the bees, there were the six
eggs, each containing a dead young Owl that would have been
hatched in a few days' time. The ill luck of these birds might
clearly have overtaken them just the same had they been quite
wild birds in their hollow tree.
But Rooks and Owls are not the only wild birds that have
fared badly in our garden this summer. A pair of Yellow-
hammers made a nest right in the middle of a big rhubarb
leaf a foot or more above the ground. The hen laid five eggs
and began to sit. It was an odd, ill-considered place, yet
doubtless she would have hatched; but there chanced a day
when a sudden storm of wind upset the nest, and all the eggs
rolled out.
A Tree-creeper, again, hatched seven eggs in the thatched
side of a garden hut. All went well until the young were just
ready to fly and then one morning saw them all dead in the nest.
Something no doubt had killed the old birds, but what ? A
weasel could have climbed up but would have taken the young
as well ; nor have we ever seen a weasel in the garden.
We had also a Goldfinch's nest in the top of a twenty-

foot Austrian pine in the stable yard. The hen was sitting, and
the cock, perched above her on the very tip of the leading shoot
sang there by the hour most charmingly. This nest was des-
troyed, I believe by Sparrows who pulled it to pieces, scatter-
ing the eggs to the ground and pilfering the material for their
own nests. In addition to this a persistent two days' rain killed
all the young in a Grey Linnets' nest.
Now of course it was merely a coincidence that so many
accidents should have befallen nests in a single garden. But
the fact does go to show some of the risks run by all wild
birds at nesting time from natural causes, though we do not
always have them so easily under observation.
P.S.--We keep a careful eye on our Sparrows' nests in the
interests of a nursery of Burrowing Owls ; and, although it has
little connexion with the foregoing, I may add that several
Sparrows' nests this year both in the ivy of the walls and in the
bird-boxes contained but a single egg, and consequently but one
nestling. It is also worth remark that in one of the bird-boxes
this summer a cock Sparrow did practically the whole of the
sitting. I only saw the hen sitting on one occasion, just before
the young one (there was but a single egg) hatched.
THE BREEDING OF THE RED-FACED LOVEBIRD.
Agapornis pullaria.
By G. C. Porter.
Early in the summer I was offered a freshly imported lot
of Red-faced Lovebirds. I had never kept these birds before, as
they are popularly supposed to be rather stupid and delicate
birds. I had my doubts about buying them, especially as the
dealer encouragingly remarked that he should not be surprised if
they all died like flies, but I could have them cheap if I cared to.
Finally curiosity prevailed over prudence and I carried off my
purchases, not however without some misgivings as to the
future. They looked well and seemed wonderfully tame, but I
found out that this was partly induced by the small space they

had been confined in and partly by their each having a clipped
wing. By the way, I cannot understand why it should be
thought necessary to clip the wings of this bird more than the
other Lovebirds, which seem to be mostly brought over intact.
On my return home I looked up my biggest cage, turned them
out into it, and placed it in the hottest part of the kitchen I could
find, thinking that the artificial heat would induce the feathers
to grow again. I had been advised to catch each bird and draw
the stubs of the quill feathers, but I did not think it advisable to
do this, as the shock might prove very injurious to these nervous
birds who almost seem afraid of their own shadow. I was told
that these birds when caught in Africa are fed solely on rice, so
failing to get a supply of paddy rice (that is rice in the husk) I gave
them ordinary table rice which they seemed very fond of. After
a week or so of this treatment I was pleased to see the bottom of
the cage plentifully strewn with shed stubs and feathers, and to
see evidences of new ones growing in their place. The weather
now began to turn warmer, enabling me to place the cage out of
doors for a few hours every day, and this began to make a
wonderful difference in their appearance. I found they very
much disliked the direct rays of the sun, invaiiably sitting under
the end of the cage which I kept covered with rhubarb leaves.
I was now able to leave them out for a longer period every day,
only taking them indoors for the night, and I added canary seed
to their supply of rice. Millet I never tried them with. The
result of this treatment was that, with one exception, they could
all fly, and one fine day I turned them out into a large well-
planted aviary, and it was a pleasure to see how they enjoyed
themselves.
For the first few weeks the foliage seemed to be getting
thinner, and the suspicion in my mind soon became a certainty
that the Lovebirds were doing their level best to wreck the aviary
and were showing a love of pruning only to be equalled by a
professional gardener. I11 about a week they nearly stripped a
large apple tree of its leaves and shoots. Their mode of
procedure was as follows :--Starting at the bottom of a twig they
would steadily crawl up it nipping off the leaves one by one until
they reached the top, when they would fly down and begin again.

352 On the Breeding of the Red-faced Lovebird.
I sooii tired of seeing this performance repeated, and decided to
decoy them into a smaller aviary abutting on the larger one. I
was very sorry indeed to have to do this, but the circumstances
compelled me. The Lovebirds were well able to take care of
themselves and would let nothing interfere with them, indeed
they seemed to be universally respected by all the birds in the
aviary. It was an easy matter to capture them by placing
the seed in the small aviary, and watching my opportunity, I
soon had them shut off. They lived very happily in the aviary,
for some months, but finding they were rather too crowded I
reduced my stock to two pairs by parting with several, chiefly to
members of the Society. Just before my departure to Scotland
I noticed signs of breeding and this interesting event unfor-
tunately took place in my absence.
They nested in a small box with half a cocoanut husk
cemented inside, but any exact details I cannot give. On my
return I found two fine young ones, which had been reared, dead
on the floor of the aviary. I do not know whether to attribute
their deaths to the mice which infest the place or to the excessive
heat at the time. The young birds were very fat and appeared
to me to be somewhat larger than the old birds. I have every
reason to be satisfied with my experience with these birds, con-
clusively proving that they are not the dull, stupid, delicate birds
they are popularly supposed to be. I only lost one adult bird,
which mysteriously disappeared one day without leaving a
feather behind, perhaps I have the mice to thank for this also.
Should anyone wish to keep a hardy, interesting little bird I
would say get a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds and you will not
be disappointed.
[Mr. Porter's experience is extremely interesting, for the
Red-faced Lovebird is generally regarded by aviculturists as
one of the most difficult birds to acclimatise, though when once
acclimatised it is acknowledged to be hardy. It is much to be
regretted that the young were not reared ; but the fact of young
having been produced at all is a matter to be proud of.-- Ed.]

Platycercus flaveolus.
By Wm. R. Fasey, F.Z.S.
My pair of Yellow-rumps have at last succeeded in rearing
one young one, which is now capable of looking after itself; two
left the nest, but from some unaccountable reason one died soon
after.
I believe Yellow-rumps to be rare, and the one at the Zoo
is the only one I know of besides my pair. I obtained mine in
1901, and in 1903 they first nested, and hatched two young ones
which died in about two weeks ; probably through neglect on
the part of the old birds. I think the fact of their being so wild
had something to do with it. Even now they are as wild as any
bird I have.
Four eggs were laid early in June; young were hatched,
as near as I can tell, in twenty days, and left the nest (half a
cocoanut husk cemented in a square box) when about a mouth
old. The young ones are marked exactly like the old ones, but
the colours are much less brilliant; the black spots 011 the
yellow ground of the old ones are only just disceruable on the
young, and instead of the bright yellow ground colour a
greenish hue exists. I11 other respects I am unable to see any
difference.
The old birds are like Pennants in build, manner and
marking, and excepting for the difference in the ground colour
the two species seem to be identical. The plate in Parrakeets is
an excellent one, and exactly corresponds to my old pair.
If any of our members care to see the young one, or other
birds of mine, I shall be delighted to show them.

Prof. W. E. D. Scott,
The nest was built inside the house, quite near the roof, amid some old
pine branches which I had nailed up for that purpose. It was composed
solely of hay; and was so small that it appeared hardly capable of holding
the two eggs. When the bird was sitting on its nest it had the appearance
of a man with a hat too small for his head.
At the time of writing they have nested again and both eggs have
hatched out. The birds are of a brown vinous red, paler on the breast,
greyish blue on the forehead, and have an edging of black with blue black
blotches on the wings; the female is paler and browner in colour, and the
young resemble her.

\_Reprinted from Science, N.S., Vol. XIX., No. 483, Paoes 551-4,
April 1, 1904, by the ki?id permission of the Atithorf
During the spring of 1901, having some twenty pairs of
Canary birds mated, I attempted to induce them, in two cases, to
incubate the eggs and rear the young of wild Fringilline birds.
These experiments led me to continue similar efforts during each
succeeding spring, and I propose to summarize the results of
what occurred in this way, in 1901, 1902 and 1903.
In May, 1901, I secured a set of Song Sparrow's eggs
(. Aj elospiza cinerea melodia). There were four eggs in the nest
and incubation had just started. I brought the eggs, together
with the nest to my laboratory, and took away from a ver)'' tame
hen Canary bird four eggs which were in her nest, substituting
the Song Sparrow's eggs. I watched the hen Canary for a short
time to assure myself that my actions had not prejudiced the end
I had in view, and was presently delighted to see her return to
the nest and settle herself to brood the eggs as if they were her
own. In due time, after about eight days, all of the eggs were
hatched, and four lusty young Song Sparrows became the foster-
children of the Canary. This bird was an especially good
parent, as I had proved by her rearing with success three broods
of Canary birds during the preceding season of 1900, the whole

of the young aggregating thirteen birds, all of which reached
maturity, and were strong vigorous examples of their kind.
This hen Canary seemed as solicitous for the young Song Spar-
rows as she had been for the young of her own kind, and so far
as I could see she did everything in her power for her foster-
children. In spite of all her efforts, when the Song Sparrows
attained an age of about six days, and were just beginning to
show feathers, one by one they weakened and died, though
both the parent Canaries, cock and hen, fed and brooded them
constantly.
Later in the same season I secured a clutch of four Field
Sparrow's eggs ( Spizella pusilla ), and&amp;apos; gave them to another
equally good pair of parent Canaries. The results were almost
identical with the case cited above ; the eggs were all hatched,
the young seemed strong and vigorous, the foster-parents
appeared to do everything conducive to their development, but
all of the young died during the first week after they were hatched
from the egg. This concluded my efforts in this direction for
the spring of 1901. In the month of May, 1902, I was able to
carry on a much more elaborate series of experiments, which I will
now summarize. Some of these, in the light of my former ex-
perience, I conducted under slightly varying conditions, which I
thought might yield more definite results. On May nth, 1902, I
found in a field on the ground a nest of Field Sparrows, the
female sitting on four eggs, and there were, at the same time, two
larger eggs in the nest, which I took to be those of the Cowbird
(. Molothrns ater). The nest and eggs I brought to the house,
keeping them warm, and placed the four Field Sparrow's eggs
under a hen Canary which was sitting, and the two Cowbird's
eggs I gave to another Canary. Both females covered the new
eggs which had been inti&amp;apos;oduced into their nest, and brooded
them within a moment after I had left them. The four Field
Sparrow's eggs, placed under the first Canary, began to hatch on
the morning of May 22nd. I had left one Canary bird's egg in
the nest, and this also was hatched early the next day. Another
of the Field Sparrow's eggs hatched late on May 22nd, and in
the morning of May 23rd there were in the nest one Canary and
three Field Sparrows, and one unhatched egg of a Field

Sparrow. On May 24th I discovered the three Field Sparrows
dead in the nest, but the young Canary bird was flourishing, and
in course of time grew up to maturity under its parents' care.
To return to the Cowbird's eggs in the same clutch ; both
of these eggs were hatched on the morning of the twenty-second,
and, also, two Canary bird's eggs which I had left with them, so
that there were two Cowbirds and two young Canary birds in the
nest. Throughout the day and on the day succeeding one the
parent birds paid close attention to the brood, and the young
birds, I could see, were strong and hearty, as all four of them
raised their heads to be fed, and seemed to be treated precisely
alike by the parent Canaries. The same conditions prevailed on
May 24th. On the morning of May 25th the birds were doing
well and had grown rapidly. On the afternoon of May 25th
one of the Cowbirds died, though the other was still strong,
and with the two young Canary birds was constantly fed by
the parents. On May 25th the second Cowbird died, and I
introduced two young Chipping Sparrows, apparently of about
the same age as the two young Canaries, to take the place of the
two Cowbirds. I saw the old Canary bird at once feed the two
Sparrows as she did her own birds, and during the day a young
man, whom I had posted to watch the proceedings, reported that
they were constantly fed. On May 27th the two young Sparrows
were strong and healthy, as well as the young Canaries. The
same conditions prevailed on the twenty-eighth, and on the
twenty-ninth of the month. On May 30th one of the Sparrows
died and was removed. The other appeared strong and healthy,
and so far fledged that its species could be discriminated. The
old birds fed the remaining young one throughout the day as
well as the young Canaries. On May 31st the young Sparrow
and the Canaries were vigorous and flourishing. This condition
of affairs was maintained until June 2nd. On June 2nd I found
the single Sparrow so far grown as to be able to leave the nest,
though the two Canaries were not so far advanced. At eleven
o'clock the young Sparrow left the nest and hopped about the
floor of the cage ; after an hour I put him back in the nest,
where he remained till the next morning. On June 3rd the
Chipping Sparrow again left the nest, and I did not return him

to the structure until late in the day. On the fourth, the two
young Canaries and the Chipping Sparrow all left the nest,
though the Canaries resorted to it from time to time. All the
birds grew and flourished, but on the ninth of June the Chipping
Sparrow died. The two Canary birds, however, throve and
ultimately reached maturity. During the latter part of his life,
the Sparrow was going about the bottom of the cage and
hopping on the perches, attended to carefully by the parent birds.
He, however, did not seem especially strong in his legs, and for a
short period, four or five hours before his death, he was not only
unable to grasp the perches, but could not run about the bottom
of the cage as he had done earlier. I concluded that several
factors may have militated against the rearing of this bird b)^
Canaries : (1) His development seemed more rapid than that of
the young Canaries, and he was more restless and anxious to
leave the nest than were the domesticated birds. (2) I think
that the artificial lining of the Canary's nest was of such a nature
as not to permit the proper development of the leg muscles and
feet during the time he was in the nest. (3) The length of the
tarsus in the Sparrow, being twice as great as that of the Canary
birds, seems an important element to take into account, as this
part of the leg was so long that it seemed to be not only in his
way, but was constantly trodden on and sat upon by his two
associates. It must be remembered that this bird left the nest
voluntarily on the date first mentioned, and though restored
several times, very soon left it again. He appeared to be very
uncomfortable in the nest, and this discomfort was largely due to
the length of his legs. At the time of his death the bird was
about two-thirds grown, and almost fully feathered in the first
plumage of the Chipping Sparrow (Spizella socialis ) ; though he
could hop about the floor of the cage, and for a time was able
even to balance himself on the perches, his legs, on the whole,
seemed weak, and I attribute the cause of this misdevelopment
of the muscles and tendons of the feet and legs to the kind of
nest lining used by the Canaries. I may say here that this con-
sisted of deer-hair with an admixture of cow-hair, the whole
being a felted mass, and not presenting the grasping surface
afforded by the fabric and lining of the Chipping Sparrow's
nest, as found out of doors.

Prof. W. E. D. Scott,
My experiments in the season of 1902 included, besides
the above, an additional brood of Song Sparrows, which con-
tained four Song Sparrow's and one Cowbird's egg. All of these
hatched and lived for periods varying from four to seven days,
none of the birds leaving the nest; I also experimented with a
clutch of five fresh eggs of the Yellow-winged Sparrow
(Ammodramus savannarum passerinus ), which I divided between
two different parent Canaries, leaving two Canary's eggs with
three Yellow-winged Sparrow's eggs, and in the other case two
Yellow-winged Sparrow's eggs with three Canary bird's eggs.
Both clutches were hatched, there being five young birds in
each nest. The Canary birds in both cases were reared and
reached maturity, but the young Yellow-winged Sparrows which
were also hatched died at ages varying from four to seven days.
I also attempted during this season to raise young
Bobolinks under Canaries {Dolichonyxoryzivorus) ; to this end on
May 28th, having found a nest of five eggs, I introduced two of
them to a large breed of English Canary, leaving two of her own
eggs in the nest ; the other three Bobolink's eggs I placed under
another Canary of a similar kind, leaving two Canary eggs in
addition. This Canary threw out her own eggs, but retained the
Bobolink's eggs, and incubated them till they were hatched,
which was on June 8th. The three young Bobolinks lived for
three days, when one of them died ; the remaining ones died on
the fifth day. The other Bobolink's eggs, under the English
Canary, were also hatched on the eighth, but both died on the
tenth of the month ; the young Canary birds hatched at the
same time were reared to maturity, when I no longer followed
their history.
In the spring of 1903 I tried several similar experiments,
sometimes putting but one egg of a wild bird with a clutch of
Canary's eggs, and never giving one Canary an entire comple-
ment of wild bird's eggs. In all cases the eggs were hatched
and in no case did the foster-young attain an age of more than a
week, though it is to be remembered that in every case young
Canaries in the same brood with the foster-birds flourished and
reached maturity. During the season of 1903 I took two young
Song Sparrows, just beginning to show the feathers, and put

them with two Canaries about the same size, though more fully
feathered. These birds were readily adopted by the parent
Canaries, but one of them died after three days; the other was
reared, reached maturity, was weaned by the old birds, being
treated precisely as were their own young, and is still alive at this
writing.
This series of experiments I have reported as a suggestion
for further work of a similar kind. I had hoped that hatching
the eggs of wild birds under Canaries would enable me to
observe the development of the foster-young to an advanced age.
It seemed to me that there would be no possibility of their song
being other than such as could be attributed either to inheritance
or to intimate association with a new kind of singing bird. In
all this I have, of course, met with disappointment ; the only
young bird being reared to maturity, from the many I have
tried, was a Song Sparrow, almost fledged before introduced to
his foster-parents. It has occurred to me that perhaps the kind
of food, partially digested by the parent Canary birds, and then
regurgitated and fed to their young, would have militated against
the growth and development of another kind of bird. How-
ever, in the case of three Cowbird's eggs upon which I have
experimented, all of which were hatched, this should not have
prejudiced their growth, when we consider the variety of foster-
parents that are induced to hatch and rear the eggs and j^ouug of
the Cowbird.
To briefly summarize the work I have described in some
detail, forty-one different eggs of wild birds, representing six
species, and three young birds already hatched, form the
aggregate of individuals dealt with. All of the forty-one eggs
were fertile, and were hatched by the foster-parents. This is
suggestive in regard to the propagating powers of wild birds,
and though not conclusive, indicates a much higher percentage
of fertility in the eggs laid by them than obtains in song birds
when caged, or semi-domesticated. None of the young which
were hatched from these eggs reached a greater age than seven
days, which would seem to indicate that the food supplied by the
foster-parents, which was the same on which they raised their
own offspring, was of a kind so different from that used by wild

birds in rearing their young, that it proved inadequate. I also
believe that the nest lining was of a character so unlike that of
the nests natural to the foster-chicks, that it prejudiced their
development and growth.
In the light of the knowledge I have gained I shall
endeavour, in the coming breeding season, to conduct further
experiments of a similar character, and hope for better results.
It seems worthy of note that I have been able to rear not only all
the kinds of birds mentioned by hand, but in addition some
twenty other species of song birds. These birds have been taken
from their parents' care at ages varying from three to six or seven
days, and over ninety per cent, have been successfully reared,
being fed by hand. Such birds in most cases have not only
reached maturity, but many of them have lived from three to
seven years.

I suppose nearly every Member of the Avicultural Society
commenced with the A. B. C. of Aviculture, viz. Budgerigars,
Canaries or the more commonly imported finches--and it is as
well it is so for the sake of experience! No one can teach us,
and we learn some lessons, at any rate, when keeping these
pretty, but fortunately inexpensive, birds.
But as time goes on and we are ?iot content with the
A. B. C., we want to try our hands on more interesting and
consequently more delicate birds. Perhaps as a bird keeper of
some years experience, a few words on the health of the more
delicate finches may be acceptable. At the present time I have

practically unknown, but in the six gloomy winter months, when
the aviary is heated with hot pipes and ventilation a difficult
matter, it was a different tale.
The winter before last I lost numbers of little birds, so
constant were the deaths that I feared I had bird fever amongst
my flock. Nearly all my Gouldians died and one or two Parrot
Finches, and none looked well. It was their first Winter in
their present aviary and I had perhaps forty small finches in an
aviary 14ft. by 12ft. and 12ft. high.
But it puzzled me why they should die in the winter and
not in the summer. Their aviary never went below 450, and
was kept at an even temperature, the water was tepid, and no
green food given, unless sound and dry, and yet they died.
The causes of death were principally enteritis, or liver
and bowel complaints, or pneumonia, and these diseases never
occurred in the summer.
I suppose how far blood poisoning is the primary cause
of these diseases is somewhat doubtful, but pneumonia amongst
human beings is constantly caused by blood poisoning.
A heated aviary in the winter rarely gets thoroughly
aired, all the birds are confined in a narrow space, and the poison
from the excreta must accumulate in the form of bad gas.
Who does not know the rather stuffy smell of a heated
aviary the first thing.in the morning before it has been aired.
I doubt if human beings would be well under such
circumstances, and surely the delicate tiny finches accustomed
to pure air, must be affected. To open a window all night
would be to court disaster, as a finch would be sure to choose
a draughty spot and die of inflammation of the lungs next day.
It is also certain that when birds can winter out of doors
they have much better health than those in heated aviaries.
I had always heard that to keep eucalyptus trees, growing
in a room, was a remedy against influenza, in any case a powerful
and natural disinfectant, as the living tree consumes the bad
gas, and keeps the air pure and healthy. I therefore, last

Mr. D. Seth-Smith,
*winter, placed four eucalyptus trees in my aviary--one with the
Black-capped Lories, which they promptly devoured--oue with
the Starlings, they ate a large number of leaves, it did not appear
to cause them any inconvenience, although as a rule they will
not eat green of any kind. The little Finches did not eat the
leaves, but there is no doubt the air of the aviary was purer and
fresher in the mornings.
I lost nothing like the number of birds last winter, and
they appeared so much livelier and less heavy than previously.
They had two trees in their aviary, the Eucalyphis globulus ,
the most common tree of this variety in Australia. The great
enemies of the eucalyptus are the mice. It appears to be as
popular with them as the Starlings or Lories, and I think the
oldest tree procurable would be the least extravagant, as they
cannot bite through the old bark. The top of the pot must be
wired and also underneath to prevent the mice burrowing in, and
if this can be managed the tree, well watered, will thrive and
do well in the aviary, as it is a fairly hardy variety, but will not
stand severe frosts.
I cannot help thinking if this tree was kept in every
aviary the birds' health would greatly benefit, and there would
be a smaller casualty list at the end of our Magazine.

prolificacy of the species, and the ready way in which it breeds
in captivity. The following notes will, I think, prove more
conclusively than ever that this species is polyandrous.
When I wrote my former notes there was one bird reared
and a second brood of three, about a fortnight old, all of which
have now grown into fine birds. By July 21st another clutch of
six eggs had been laid, and the original male, which we will call
No. 1, commenced to sit. I was away from home at the time,
but sent word that the female should be driven into another
aviary in which were the four immature birds, and the new
imported male, which I have already mentioned as having
arrived on the 6th of June. This was done on July 28th.
This male, which we will call No. 2, was, and still is, an
extremely shy bird, and it would not have been at all surprising
had he shown no inclination to breed before next spring or
summer. However, they appear to have paired at once,
for on my return home on August 4th there was a nest with one
egg in it, hidden behind some rough logs. Four more were laid
on alternate days, and, on August 10th, the male (No. 2 ) com-
menced to sit, and although such a shy bird, he sat extremely
well. When this bird came its bill was a lead-colour, either
showing that it was not in breeding condition, or that it was an
immature bird, but it soon turned red.
The same day as No 2 commenced to sit. No. 1 brought
off a fine brood of six, every egg proving fertile.
September 1st. Male No. 2 hatched four out of the five
eggs, the fifth being addled.
As I write the brood of six, hatched by male No. 1, are
grand young birds, and have now become very tame, running
towards me when I enter the aviary, and almost taking tit-bits
from my hands, although for the first week or two the young are
extremely shy/*
D. Seth-Smith.
* The old female has gone back to her original mate (No. i) and has laid still another
clutch of 6 eggs upon which the male has commenced to sit. (Sept, nth.)

Articles of Incorporation have just been drawn looking to
the establishment on a permanent foundation of the " Worthing-
ton Society for the Investigation of Bird Life." The founder,
Mr. Charles C. Worthington, will erect and endow, on his estate
at Shawnee, Monroe County, Pennsylvania, the necessary
buildings and equipment.
The Worthington Society will have for its purpose the
consideration of bird life as it is found in nature, and will also
have many birds under confinement for study and experiment.
The following is a summary of the chief topics that will
present an immediate field for experimentation, which it is
proposed by the liberality of the foundation to make continuous
and exhaustive in the hope of reaching conclusive results.
I. The study and consideration of a bird as an individual.
It is believed that by means of observation carried
through the entire life of the individual, with a daily
record brief or elaborate as exigencies may require, much
will be learned regarding matters that are now obscure.
Facts, such as growth, habits, health, temper, etc.,
will be daily reported.
II. The study of the occurrence, extent, nature and cause of
variations in different representatives of the same species.
III. Changes in color and appearance correlating with age,
sex and season.
IV. Changes in colour and appearance due to light, heat,
presence or absence of moisture, and to food. How
rapid a change of appearance can be effected by a new
environment or a new set of conditions ?
V. Heredity. What general characteristics are transmitted ?
Are acquired characteristics transmitted ? The consid-
eration of atavism, prepotency and telegony.
VI. Experiments in breeding. Hybridity and the fertility of
hybrids. The possibility of establishing a new physio-
logical species.

VII. Experiments in change of color due to moult.
VIII. Adaptability. The plasticity of animals. How great a
factor is this in domesticating new kinds of animals ?
IX. The leisure of animals. How is this acquired ? Being
acquired, how is this employed ?
X. Instinct, habit, and the development of intelligence.
XI. The possibility of breeding insectivorous and other
beneficial kinds of birds to re-stock a given region or to
increase native birds, as has been done in the case of
fish, by the United States Fish Commission.
A temporary laboratory and aviary is being equipped, and
preliminary work will begin with the instalment of a large
number of native and foreign birds early in September. Mr.
Worthington has procured the services of Mr. William E. D. Scott,
Curator of the Department of Ornithology at Princeton Uni-
versity, as Director of the proposed work. Mr. Bruce Horsfall
has been engaged as chief assistant and artist. The corps of
assistants and workers will be increased as the plans of the
Worthington Society develop.

Sir, --The new rules of the Society carry one step farther the move-
ment which was commenced with the previous revision of the rules, and
which appears to have for its object the removal of the affairs of the
Society from the control of the general body of the members and the
placing of them in the hands of a few.
Believing, as we do, that the original democratic constitution of the
Society tended in a much greater degree than the present oligarchic one to
the well-being of the Society and the promotion of the science of avicul-
ture, we have decided, if we obtain the necessary number of proposers, to
stand for election to the Council in opposition to the official candidates, in
order to give the members an opportunity of expressing their approval or
disapproval of the new rules. We shall stand simply in support of the
principal of popular control, and we now announce our intention, before
the names of the official candidates are known to us, in order that we may
not be suspected of any personal opposition to them.

[The new rule relating to the election of the Council was very care-
fully considered at the recent Annual Meeting of the Council, and it was
passed in the belief that it would be to the interest of the Society and of
aviculture.
It was thought that a change of blood in the Council each year was
necessary. Some of its members had served for many years, and by
compelling two members to resign each year, commencing with those who
have served the longest without a break, a change is assured. It is
absolutely essential that members who serve on the Council shall be
friendly toward the Society and have its welfare at heart; and it stands to

reason that the existing Council, who naturally know more of the inner
workings of the Society than the other members, are best suited to
recommend the two members who are to take the place of those retiring.
This is a plan that is adopted by the Zoological and most other societies
with perfect success.
It is obvious that a society like ours must be more or less governed
by a few. It could not be worked successfully otherwise. We are perfectly
certain that any member who takes a keen interest in the Society and the
Magazine, and who has their best interest at heart , will have no difficulty
whatever in being nominated to serve on the Council.
We entirely fail to see that the Society is any more oligarchic now
than in the days when Mr. Fillmer practically ran it himself! Every
member has a right to use the Magazine, so long as he writes upon suitable
subjects; in fact it is difficult to persuade enough members to write--they
will leave the writing to a few. But it is not the fault of the few if their
names appear often. With the coloured plates again, a notice has been
inserted requesting members to suggest subjects; whereas formerly the
matter was almost entirely left to the Executive Committee.
The chief question to consider is whether the Society and Magazine
are a success under the present regime ; and we venture to think that all
but a few malcontents are satisfied with it. We ask our members to decide
for themselves as to whether the Magazine and the Society are any worse
off now, \0x25A0when it is said to be in the hands of a clique, than it was in the
days of its "original democratic constitution."
What has happened since those days ? In 1899 the April and May
issues consisted of twelve pages only, " less than ever before since the first
year of the Society," as Mr. Fillmer remarked (Vol. V. p. 140). In the
volume for 1900 he evidently believed that the days of the Societj r were
numbered if the Magazine were to continue in its present course, for he
strongly advocated the inclusion in its scope of Mammals, Reptiles, Fishes,
and Canaries. Needless to say the majority of the members strongly
objected to such a change, for they believed that there were still many
aviculturists, who had never heard of the Society, who would readily join
when the Magazine became better known, and that it would some day
become an important Society with a Magazine that the members might
well be proud of. That they were justified in this belief is proved by the
fact that when Mr. Fillmer left the Society there were only 254 members,
whereas there are now over 400.
I11 Volume VII. Mr. Fillmer&amp;apos;s name does not appear at all in the list
of contributors, although it had been conspicuous in all former volumes.
The Report of the Council, published at the end of that volume, announced
that Mr. Fillmer had entirely severed his connection with the Society.
This was at a time when the Society and its Magazine were at a low ebb,

and it was necessary that a strong effort should be made if it were not to go
to the wall entirely.
The Council with one accord put its shoulder to the wheel. Many
\0x25A0changes were made ; Annual Council Meetings were held ; the rules, which
were by no means efficient, were revised, and, we hope at least that, the
result is a stronger Society and a Magazine of an altogether higher standard.
And this in spite of the fact that in October 1901 Mr. Fillmer started a new
magazine and a new society, known respectively as " Foreign Bird Notes,"
and "The Foreign Bird Club," presumably as rivals to the "Avicultural
Magazine " and Society. Four months later the F. B. C. joined hands with
the "National British Bird and Mule Clnb," and the Magazine changed its
name to that of "Bird Notes," under which title it still exists with Mr.
Fillmer at its head ; but the British Bird and Mule Club has now broken off
its connection with it. Bvery effort was made to persuade our members
to join the F. B. C.; printed circulars, and, in some cases, specimen copies
\0x25A0of * Bird Notes,' were sent to them, and, as a special inducement, members
of the Avicultural Society were allowed to join without paying an entrance
fee. The natural result of this was that a number of our members deserted
us to join the Foreign Bird Club, the annual subscription to which, at that
time, was less than that of the Avicultural Society.
In December last, when our Society had reached, by careful manage-
ment and much hard work at the hands of its officers, an important
position, Mr. Fillmer rejoined, and the above communication is his first
contribution to our New Series.-- Ed.]
THE GREAT-BILLED PARRAKEET.
Sir,--T he other day, on my way to the Natural History Museum I
looked into a bird shop (Musgrave's) just opposite Harrod's Stores. There
I saw what, for a moment I mistook for an Alexandrine Parrakeet, but I
soon saw that it wasn't, though the general shape of the bird is like that
species, with a large head and very large red&amp;apos; beak, and a short, though
somewhat pointed tail. The colour is bright bluish green above, and
yellowish green underneath. O11 the wings are some black feathers edged
with yellow, like a red Rosella's back. O11 a top shelf at the Museum I saw
a stuffed specimen of this bird, but, though I climbed on a chair I could
not see its name, as the label was turned blank side outwards, like the price
tickets of all the most fascinating things in the shop windows.
Yesterday I hunted all over the Zoo. for a parrot like him, but failed
to find one. So to-day I went into the shop and asked. The man there
told me it is a " Hornbill Parrot from India; the only one in England ; has
been in his possession eight months ; price 13 guineas." He told me he
could not find out its scientific name. The beak is very large, but not a bit
like a HornbiU's, more like a large red radish, or a small Dutch cheese. Is

Sir, --Seeing that you have been successful in rearing Diamond
Doves, I should like to ask you if you will tell me what is the best food to
give the young ones ; and how long do the old birds sit ?
I have a pair in my outdoor aviary, and they have just carried a few
heather branches into a small travelling box, and I should think they have
been sitting about a week now. I have not seen any eggs, because so soon
as one bird conies out of the box the other goes in, and I am afraid of
disturbing them. At present I just feed them on white millet seed.
Frank Bathe.
The following reply has been sent to Mr. Frank Bathe:
Diamond Doves sit about 14 days. I supply no special food for the
young ones. The old birds have canary and millet seed, and rear their
young quite successfully on this. So long as your pair are undisturbed iu
any way they will most probably hatch and rear their brood.

Sir, --The Waders which I mentioned in my article, and which
Mr. Meade-Waldo has marked as Open-billed Storks, were more like Purple
Coots, only chocolate and brown--not the shape of Storks.
The Meyer's Parrots are doing well out of doors, and have got much
brighter in colour.
T shall be very, glad to answer any questions I can about the birds or
country. The whole trip is a most interesting and enjoyable one--and one
which I strongly recommend to anyone who is keen about birds--of course
we saw it rather to an advantage, as so few steamers had been up the Nile
to disturb the birds (ours was the second to do the trip this year).
We also saw a herd of twenty-seven Giraffe, countless Hippopotomi,
and about six kinds of Antelopes--all from the steamer--while at Kanissa
we saw the tracks of a large herd of Elephants.
There were of course countless birds which I did not know, and so
did not mention in my article.

supplied freely birch and other branches, wool and moss (the latter never
used)." W. H. ST. Quintin.
[Mr. St. Quintin, being abroad, was unable to correct the proofs, and
the Editor much regrets that so foolish an error was allowed to pass
unnoticed].

RULES.
Each bird must be forwarded, as soon after death as possible, carefully packed and postage
paid, direct to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Establishment, Bexley Heath,
Kent, and must be accompanied by a letter containing the fullest particulars of
the case. Domestic poultry, pigeons, and Canaries cannot be dealt with. If a reply
by post is required a fee of 2/6 must be enclosed.
Bengalee. (Miss Brampton). (Acute inflammation of the bowels caused
death].
REd-Eaced Lovebird. (Miss Walfe). Fed on white millet. [Your bird
was much emaciated, and I certainly think white millet alone is not
sufficiently nourishing. Give the large maize boiled fresh daily,
canary and millet seed, and good sound white oats].
Green AvadavaT. (Mr. Tomes). [Fractured skull was cause of death].
Red-headed Gouedian. (Hon. Mrs. Hodgson). [Your bird died of
inflammation of the cloaca through the retention of a fully formed
egg, which was broken],
Virginian Nightingale. (Lady Harriet Warde). I11 my possession 18
months. Up to day before death this bird was singing splendidly. I
think he was beginning to moult. He was fed on canary, rape,
millet, with occasional hemp seed. Bread crumbs, egg at times,
currants, Hawkins' soft bill food, and a good deal of fruit, and meal-
worms three times a week. [Your bird died of apoplexy. These
birds are very subject to fits which are, I think, usually due to over-
feeding. They are very hardy, being able to bear our severest winters
out of doors with impunity. I have had many and never lost one, and
my treatment was as follows. Kept out of doors all weathers. During
the summer and warm months of spring and autumn fed on canary,
millet, oats, with plenty of fruit, and occasionally some boiled maize,
of which they were very fond. During the colder months I
gave, in addition to the above, occasionally sunflower seed, and
regularly a little hemp and Century food. Thanks for P.O. 2/6].

Post Mortem Examinations.
Bicheno Finch. (Mrs. A. K. Connell). [Pneumonia was the cause of
death],
Eceectus Parrot. (Mrs. A. K. Connell). Has been ailing with a bad
throat for a long time. [The bird died of suffocation caused by a
growth at the back of pharynx which had completely grown over
the top or opening of the larynx. It is a wonder that the bird has
been able to swallow its food for a long while].
Hen Shamah. (Miss Alderson). [The bird had a fractured skull,
caused by direct violence. It is quite possible the Quails are the
culprits].
Gouedian Finch. (Mrs. Howard Williams). The bird died of apoplexy.
There being a large clot of extravasted blood all over the left side of
brain].
Bueefinch and Gouedian Finch. (Mr. Teschemaker). [Bullfinch was a
hen and died of enteritis. Gouldiau died of fatty degeneration of
liver. No particulars of feeding, etc., so cannot say if there is any
fault in this respect.]
CockaTiee. (Mrs. C. H. Williams). [Death was due to internal haemor-
rhage from a ruptured abdominal blood vessel].
Cordon BeEU. (Mrs. Barber). Has been in outdoor aviary from May to
end of August. [Your bird had a fit caused by pressure on the brain.
There was an extensive blood clot at the lower part of right side of
brain].
Yeeeow Budgerigar. (Mrs. Noble). [Concussion of the brain caused
death. Budgerigars frequently stampede at night. If one commences
they nearly all join in. Whether caused by fright I cannot say, but I
have repeatedly heard mine do this].
White Java Sparrow. (Miss E. Bamford). [Your bird died of con-
cussion of the brain caused by direct injury to the skull],
Orange-feanked Parrakket. (Mr. N. O'Reilly). [Your bird died of
liver disease of long standing, this organ being nearly twice its
normal size. Thanks for P.O. 2/6].
Eight WaxbieeS. (Lad}&amp;apos;&amp;apos; Carnegie). Arrived from London in apparently
perfect health. They were all found dead next morning. They ate
ravenously all the day. [All died of infectious (or septic) enteritis.
Thoroughly disinfect cage (or if not a valuable one destroy it) before
putting any other birds into it].
Arthur Giee.
