THE SCARLET COCK OF THE ROCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980559032258064" page_id="56311433"  page_num="1" year="" vol="">
By J. Delacour
Owing to some differences in the muscles of the legs, modern
authors have separated the Cocks-of-the-Rocks ( Rupicola ) from the
Gotinga family and placed them in one of their own. Whether or
not this characteristic is a sufficiently deep rooted one for such a
drastic splitting still remains to be proved, and I have no opinion
to-day on the subject. These birds, however, look and behave like
Cotingas and are certainly very closely allied to them.
The Amazonian Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola rupicola) is well known
in aviculture and has often adorned zoo cages and private aviaries.
I always had one or two in the inner compartments of the tropical
house at Cleres. Given enough shade, dampness, and proper food
containing plenty of carrot, tomato, and various red berries, the
males kept their beautiful orange colour well. They always proved
disagreeable and I never could keep a pair together for any length of
time. They are dangerous to other birds if they can catch them,
and I was horrified one day to find the mangled remains of a pair of
Purple Sunbirds which had shared for some time the large and
planted compartment of the Gocks-of-the-Rock which, I had thought,
could never get hold of them. At the St. Louis Zoo they managed
to keep four or five males together in a large planted indoor aviary,
but they proved troublesome ; fights were frequent and often one or
two had to be removed ; moreover, losses were never published.
At liberty, R. rupicola gather in large numbers and each male dances
in turn. How accurate are some narrations of these wonderful
performances I am not prepared to say.
The Amazonian Cock-of-the-Rock inhabits the forests of the low-
lands and hills of the Guianas, Southern Venezuela, and Northern
Brazil, that is to say, the Amazonian region, being partial to rocky
slopes and cliffs.
The second species has its own peculiarities. While the Amazonian

Cock has a high compressed crest with a thin dark subterminal border,
truncated tertiaries, and tail coverts with disintegrated barbs that
look like lace, the Andean Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola peruviana) has
a thick crest and all the feathers are normal in shape. As is shown on
the accompanying plate, its colour pattern is very different. The
three vermilion and orange subspecies ( peruviana , aequatorialis, saturata )
are found in the subtropical parts of the Eastern Andes, from 3,000
to 12,000 feet, in forest, and extend from Bolivia to Venezuela. The
scarlet subspecies, however, which is figured here and is the only one
to have been imported alive so far, inhabits the western slopes of the
Andes in Ecuador and Colombia. It is the finest of all and the only
true scarlet one. It was first brought alive to New York in December,
1941, by C. Cordier, who landed twelve specimens in perfect con-
dition, three of which remained at the Bronx Zoo, the others going
to other zoos and a pair to Mrs. Milton Erlanger. Their capture
has been reported in the Avicultural Magazine, 1942, pp. 3-4,
with a photograph of one of them. They proved much more peaceful
and sociable than the Amazonian species. At the time of writing,
two of the original males are still living at the Bronx Zoo in perfect
condition, if a little faded in colour. One has been sharing for a few
years a large planted compartment with Quetzals, Umbrella Birds,
Tanagers, and several other birds, and there have been no quarrels.
Since Mr. Cordier's visit in 1941 the inhabitants of South-Western
Colombia, who had learnt from him how to catch and to feed Scarlet
Cocks-of-the-Rock, have regularly sent a few every year to the Louis
Ruhe firm, in New York. The same thing happened with Quetzals
in Costa Rica, so that these two marvellous species are well represented
at present in American collections.
Mr. F. Fooks brought a full-coloured male to London in 1947, but
it unfortunately did not live long.
Like its Amazonian cousin, the Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock is omni-
vorous, but feeds mostly on fruit. Both are extraordinarily dainty
eaters and for their size consume an astonishingly small quantity of
food.

BRITISH AVICULTURE :
PROSPECT AND RETROSPECT
By Alastair Morrison
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999496289473684" page_id="56311431"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
The present low ebb in which the practice of aviculture finds itself
calls, I think, for an effort at stocktaking, to survey the past and to
try and forecast the future. The old days and the conditions as we
knew them before the war are gone for ever. Is there still a place for
aviculture ? The answer to that question depends on the body of
aviculturists as a whole ; on the positive effort they are prepared to
make to help themselves and the precautions which they take to
avoid the mistakes of the past.
Aviculture consists of the practice of keeping birds in captivity for
the pleasure that their possession affords, for scientific study, for
educational purposes, and for the preservation and maintenance of
species which are threatened with extinction in a wild state. Of these
four objects, the first is the one which is most difficult to justify and
which, at the same time, is undoubtedly the strongest motive which
induces people to keep birds in captivity. Birds are such beautiful and
fascinating creatures that most of us take pleasure in seeing and
observing them in a wild state. Small wonder then that many of us
like to increase our contacts with birds by keeping additional specimens
in captivity where we try to maintain them and to breed them in the
same perfect condition as if they were in a wild state, by careful
treatment and attention to their wants. This is a motive which is
much decried by the critics of bird keeping in general, but I regard it
as a perfectly reasonable one and see no cause to be apologetic about
it. Birds can be kept in the most perfect health and condition in
captivity and will live for years in such a state, in many cases probably
longer than they would have done in a wild state, although it is not
possible to make any firm assertions on this point due to our incomplete
knowledge concerning longevity in wild birds. But the motive which
I have outlined is certainly the basic reason which leads most people to
keep birds. The number of aviculturists who keep birds for any other
reason is very limited.
Much can be learned from a careful study of birds in captivity,
particularly the study of moults and breeding habits. Unfortunately,
however, it must be freely admitted that the record of aviculturists in
careful and scientific observation is a very poor one. Large numbers of
birds have been kept and bred in captivity, often under ideal conditions,
but the number of accurate, careful observations which have been
published is very limited. Scientific ornithologists not infrequently

have queries which could be answered by aviculturists, and their
virtual inability to do so is the cause of some exasperation, a very
unfortunate state of affairs. I can cite two examples which came to my
attention recently. One well-known ornithologist has been making a
study of the evolution of the African Lovebirds. As is well known,
several of the species (Peach-faced, Fischer's, Masked, Nyassa, and
Black-cheeked) are closely related and interbreed freely. Before the
introduction of the Parrot ban they were imported into this country
in very large numbers and almost every conceivable hybrid between
the various species was bred. A careful study of such hybrids would be
most helpful in trying to establish the nature of their common ancestor
but there is little detailed and accurate information on the subject.
Careful descriptions of the various crosses are lacking and no good
series of such specimens was ever preserved for museum use. In order
to obtain all the desired information it would be necessary to start all
over again, which is practically impossible to-day. On another
occasion I encountered an ornithological authority whose views on a
prominent aviculturist, to whom he had unsuccessfully applied for
information concerning moults, practically ignited the atmosphere.
It is a great pity that this sort of thing should happen because it brings
aviculture into disrepute with scientific ornithologists and ensures the
latters' disapproval of all traffic in birds. It is scientific ornithologists
whose views carry weight with such phenomena as Colonial Govern-
ments, on the good will of which will ultimately depend any resumption
of the importation of birds.
Some valuable scientific work has been done on birds kept in
captivity, for instance experiments on the effect of light on the sexual
development of birds, but it has not been done by individuals who
would normally be considered as aviculturists, and certainly not by
members of the Society. Obviously, highly technical matters cannot
be attempted by the average aviculturist, but there is much room for
co-operation between the aviculturist and the more scientific orni-
thologist. The best way to improve the position is, I think, to set up
some machinery whereby members of the Society can be informed of
the type of information desired by museum workers and others, a
special liaison committee which would ascertain the requirements of
workers in the British Museum and members of the B.O.U. Some
effort on these lines would do much to enhance the standing of the
Society, which at present is not very high.
I often think that the word scientific has a frightening effect on the
average aviculturist. He conjures up visions of retorts and test tubes,
and elderly, absent-minded gentlemen, with high domed heads,
speaking an incomprehensible jargon to a select few. The truth is
that any series of observations or experiments on any aspect of bird
life which are careful, accurate, and sustained, and which lead to any

addition to our knowledge may fairly be considered scientific. This
applies just as much to additions to our knowledge concerning the
practice of aviculture as to anything else. I would like to see the
Avicultural Magazine contain three types of contribution in roughly
equal proportions, firstly, notes and news from various collections, etc.,
secondly, articles on the technique of aviculture, and thirdly, observa-
tions on birds kept in captivity. Verbosity and sentiment should be
completely eliminated. Newsprint is far too valuable to print the
ramblings of some aviculturists, and although we all have some form
of sentimental attachment for birds, there is not, to my knowledge, a
single aviculturist in the country who can afford to try expressing his
sentiments in writing without doing a grave disservice to the English
language. The Avicultural Magazine should contain more observa-
tions and less fiction. It should be a valuable work of reference, not a
chatty periodical.
The keeping of birds for educational purposes primarily concerns
public institutions. A good collection of birds is a living museum, far
more interesting and instructive than any dreary gallery of stuffed
birds. With proper forethought there is no reason why a collection
should not be accessible to the public without affecting the birds or even
interfering with their breeding activities, and it is most desirable that
any large collection should, to some extent, be open to the public.
Unfortunately, the attitude of the Government towards private collec-
tions is narrow-minded and unimaginative. By far the best collection
that has ever been brought together in this country was opened to the
public some years before the war. The owner, not unreasonably,
charged for admission, since the entry of the public involved him in
additional expense. The proceeds constituted a minute contribution
towards his general expenses and there was no question of his making
any profit by admitting the public. However, he omitted to charge
entertainment tax, he was taken to court by the taxation authorities
and fined for a misdemeanour. If he had cared to form himself into a
" Society ", with his butler as president, his chauffeur as secretary,
and half a dozen keepers as members of the council, he would not
have been taken to court. The law permits almost any association of
individuals to form themselves into a society which escapes entertain-
ment tax, regardless of the quality of the collection which is shown, but
any private person who opens his collection to the public, be it the
finest in the world, must either foot the entire bill himself and allow
free entry or pay entertainment tax as if he was a circus proprietor or
the manager of a cabaret. The reaction of any normal person to such
treatment is to consign the public to the devil. Let them stick to the
circus.
The preservation in a state of aviculture of birds threatened with
extinction in a wild state is a matter concerning which there is much

loose thinking and many misconceptions. It is a question on which I
shall comment in more detail later in this article. Suffice it to say that
although there is no doubt that various extinct species could have been
maintained in captivity, such as the Passenger Pigeon, and that other
species which are in danger of extinction could also be maintained,
aviculturists lack and always have lacked the high general standard of
skill and energy necessary to achieve this state of affairs. I question
whether there is a single species in danger of extinction now being
maintained in captivity in any part of the world, and the alleged rarity
in a wild state of various birds which have been maintained to some
extent in captivity by aviculturists who consider them to be on the
verge of extinction has little or no factual foundation.
These then in brief are what I consider to be the objects of aviculture.
For the purposes of this article I am largely limiting myself to the
question of keeping foreign birds. I would, however, add that I
consider any fancier, whether he be interested in foreigners, Canaries,
Budgerigars, or British birds, is equally an aviculturist, but I do not
feel competent to discuss questions relating to Canaries or Budgerigars,
although I have the utmost respect and admiration for those who keep
and breed them. Some of the best aviculturists in the country are
working-men Canary fanciers. It does not follow that such fanciers
would know the difference between a Shama and a Cockatiel, but
there can be no questioning their basic, essential skill and enthusiasm.
In the past, foreign bird keepers have tended to keep somewhat aloof
from the Budgerigar and Canary worlds, which is much to be regretted.
Let us hope that they will keep closer together in the future.
I do not believe that any thinking aviculturist will doubt that con-
ditions as they existed before the war have disappeared for good.
They were the days of wholesale importation of birds, abundant food
supplies, and great private collections, the property of wealthy and
sometimes very knowledgeable and discriminating owners. Except in
the case of Parrots, there were no restrictions on the importation of
birds, though some countries limited or prohibited their export. Birds
were available to suit all tastes and purses and every type of food was
abundant and cheap. The foreign exchange position permitted us to
buy wherever we wanted ; prices abroad were generally low ; and
there was any amount of shipping to bring the birds over. Cages,
netting, and every sort of appliance and material were in plentiful
supply. Superficially, it was a rosy picture, but it was marred by the
appalling mortality among the birds which could be imported so
cheaply and in such large numbers, and by the dirt, squalor, and
dishonesty of the bird trade. I am of the opinion that for every bird
maintained in a healthy state in captivity, twenty died in being caught
or imported. The high rate of mortality was well known to every
aviculturist who visited the bird shops. We were used to picking out

our birds from crowded cages, well knowing that a large proportion
of the other inmates of the cages were bound to die in the dealer's
shop. We can all remember advertisements such as " 6 pairs assorted
Senegal Finches, i&amp;y. carriage paid
These evils were largely due to the fact that a wholesale trade existed.
No live thing can be treated purely as an article of commerce without
suffering in the process, and birds are no exception. Where birds were
collected in small numbers by skilled collectors mortality was negligible,
but the cost was relatively high and only limited numbers of rarely kept
species were imported in this way. So long as aviculturists ignored the
brutality and preferred to buy their birds cheaply by means of whole-
sale importation than at higher prices from qualified collectors, the
trade was bound to persist. It did none of us much credit. There was
some correspondence on the subject in the Magazine in 1933 but no
action.
We were, however, living in a fool's paradise. There was a steady
tendency for the export of birds to be prohibited by many countries
and colonial territories, largely occasioned by the wasteful and
reckless manner in which commercial collecting was carried out.
The Black-cheeked Lovebird, a species with a peculiarly limited range,
was in some danger of extinction at one time. I have seen figures
which will shortly appear in the Ibis and which show that no fewer
than 16,000 birds were collected in 1929 alone. In 1930, export of
the birds was prohibited from Northern Rhodesia. How many Black-
cheeked Lovebirds exist in captivity to-day ? In the same way, the
export of Fischer's and Masked Lovebirds from Tanganyika was
prohibited in 1929. Areas of West Africa are said to have been largely
denuded of the commonly imported Waxbills and Weavers. An
increasing interest in wild life was being taken everywhere in the world
and the trade in livestock was the subject of much bitter and well-
founded criticism.
Psittacosis, towards the outbreaks of which the dirty conditions
under which Parrots were imported undoubtedly contributed, had
resulted in the Parrot ban. It was probably the thin edge of the wedge
for it now appears that this disease, or one similar to it, dangerous to
human beings and carried by birds, is not confined to Parrots. There
have been a number of outbreaks in the Faeroe Islands among fowlers
engaged in catching Fulmar Petrels or sorting their feathers, and there
have even been reports of psittacosis carried by Canaries. Whether all
these reports are justified or not I do not know, but there can be no
doubt that they were very likely to lead to further restrictions on the
importation of birds, due to the intervention of the health authorities.
However, many fine collections, both quantitatively and qualitatively,
existed, and private patrons of aviculture arranged for the special
importation of little known species from remote areas and thereby

greatly increased the number of species which have been kept in
captivity. Great progress had been made in the technique of aviculture
and relatively few groups of birds could not be kept successfully.
With the impact of the Second World War, a profound change took
place. Bird food and materials became virtually unprocurable or
fabulously expensive and all importation of birds ceased. Many fine
collections had to be broken up and the fearful rise in taxation and the
scarcity of labour and its high cost made it extremely difficult for the
owners of large collections to carry on. Stocks of all birds declined
enormously and in-breeding, coupled with technical incompetence,
combined further to reduce the numbers of those birds, such as Parrots,
game birds, and Waterfowl, which are most freely bred in captivity.
Wartime conditions still persist, and indeed there is little likelihood of
any appreciable change within the measurable future. A few, a very
few, skilled breeders are once again building up stocks, but the food
shortage remains and is likely to do so for many years, and no importa-
tions for private aviculturists are taking place, apart from an almost
negligible and often illegal trickle.
Every indication is that no importations by firms or private indi-
viduals will be sanctioned during our present economic difficulties.
No one can say how long these difficulties are likely to last, but it is most
improbable that they will terminate in the near future. If the present
shortage of bird foods and the absence of importation of fresh stocks
persist for much longer, it seems as if the practice of aviculture may
disappear altogether from this country.
It appears to me that the only method of avoiding this will be by
vigorous co-operative action on the part of all British aviculturists.
The Avicultural Society should take a lead in this matter and try to do
something positive to justify its existence. To-day is no time for
moribund apathy in any sphere of life. It should, in my opinion, be the
aim of the Society to achieve two things : firstly, to endeavour, in
conjunction with representatives of the Canary and Budgerigar
fancies, to obtain assured supplies of bird food inside the sterling area ;
and secondly, to endeavour to import limited numbers of birds on
behalf of members and under the best possible conditions.
I know this is a tall order. It will involve a lot of hard work and
expense and certain aspects of the scheme are likely to require sanction
from the Board of Trade. I do not know whether the latter will be
forthcoming. It will largely depend on the presentation of the Society's
case and the ability with which that case is handled. It may prove to
be entirely out of the question, but I am convinced that it is worth
trying. Nothing could be worse than the present position.
As regards food, the principal points to bear in mind are that in the
past most bird food was imported from non-sterling areas, and further-
more, that with the present world wide shortages of food we cannot

hope to import any food from any area where it forms a staple article
of diet. It is, I am sure, a waste of time to petition the Government for
a resumption of imports in the same way as before the war. It would
call for hard currency which would never be made available. An
attempt to establish alternative sources of supply within the sterling
area would be a very different proposition. It would be useless to try
to import millet seed from Africa, where it forms a staple article of diet.
We could not expect to import any food grains from India, in the
event of the new Dominions remaining in the sterling area, but we
might be able to obtain some form of dried insects or other insectivorous
food there. We might be able to induce Australian growers to produce
millet and Canary seed, and sunflower and hemp should not be out
of the question.
I can give an example of the sort of thing I mean. I spent the winter
of 1946-47 in Hong Kong, a British possession within the sterling area.
Sunflower seed was freely obtainable there. It is not a staple article of
diet and as far as I know its export is not prohibited, as in the case of
rice. It is a popular Chinese light snack, generally nibbled before meals
or when drinking tea. Peanuts and even hemp and red millet might
also be obtainable. They are grown in many parts of China. Not fully
realizing the present shortage of bird food in England, I did not go
into the matter in detail before I left, but enquiries could very easily be
made through one of the firms exporting from Hong Kong. Again,
appreciable quantities of Canary seed might be obtainable in Gibraltar.
Any amount of sherry can be bought there, why not Canary seed ?
I cannot say for certain whether it would be possible, but it would be
well worth finding out.
Nor am I in a position to state just what import permits might be
necessary in order to import such items of bird food, but a serious
co-operative approach to the Board of Trade by the Society on behalf
of aviculturists in general would demonstrate that they are prepared to
make a constructive effort to help themselves and would probably
receive sympathetic consideration. It would, of course, be absolutely
essential that this attempt should not be made by the Avicultural
Society alone and that the support of the Canary and Budgerigar
societies should be secured as well. Any approach must be made on
behalf of the whole avicultural world. I do not feel competent to
comment on the technical organization which would be required. The
Society possesses members who are experienced and successful business
men and who would be admirably qualified to advise on the matter.
The sort of thing which I had in mind was an Avicultural or Bird
Fanciers' Co-operative or Association, to be formed for the express
purpose of importing bird food and control of which should be shared
by the Avicultural Society and the various specialist Budgerigar and
Canary societies. Regional cage bird societies would, I think, have

to be excluded in the first instance so that the Association would not
become unduly unwieldy.
The aim of the Association would be to negotiate an agreement with
Australian and New Zealand farmers to encourage the growth of
millet and Canary seed by offering a guaranteed price on behalf of
fanciers in this country for a number of years. It would not be a big
scale contract but the agricultural authorities in Australia and New
Zealand might quite probably be interested. Profitable crops for small-
holders are always of interest. Perhaps the various affiliated Australian
and New Zealand Avicultural Societies might be able to advise as to
the prospects of such a scheme. The societies making up the Associa-
tion would have to guarantee to take certain amounts on behalf of their
members and if this was loyally abided by, there would be no need to
worry about a possible surplus falling into the hands of dealers at cut
prices. If the interests of fanciers really lay in supporting their own
co-operative, they would not be likely to cut their own throats by
purchasing elsewhere. Retail distribution would have to be the re-
sponsibility of the constituent societies after bulk allocations had been
made to them on the basis of available supplies. Each society would
have to undertake a survey to estimate the requirements of its own
members.
There would undoubtedly be an outcry on the part of seed merchants
and dealers. I do not personally feel that they deserve over much
consideration. Their record in the past has not been a very impressive
one. Their main preoccupation has been the quickest and largest
profit without any reference to the long-term interests of their cus-
tomers. For instance, no English dealer has ever had the enterprise to
produce mealworms in this country. It was always less trouble to
import them from Holland. It is almost certain that any special out
of the ordinary effort will meet with obstruction on their part. It
would be far better to try and do the job ourselves.
The main difficulty is undoubtedly going to be that of finance. The
Co-operative would have to rely not merely on the support of the con-
stituent societies and their cash balances, if any, but on the support of
all individual aviculturists. If every fancier and aviculturist is pre-
pared to support the scheme in accordance with his means, I believe
that the difficulty could be overcome. I myself am no Croesus, but
I would personally be prepared to contribute the modest sum of #20
towards the venture.
Obviously, the first requirement is to ensure a supply of food. The
next requirement is to arrange for the importation of fresh stocks of
live birds. This would be for the Avicultural Society alone and could,
I think, be achieved in two ways. In the first place, there are various
members of the Society and other persons interested in birds living
abroad who would probably be only too glad to help send small

numbers of birds to aviculturists in this country. It would be necessary
for the Society to arrange for any import permit, to pay the cost of
shipping, etc., and to set up some machinery for the equitable distribu-
tion of birds so received among members who would, in their turn,
have to undertake to see that no birds are left on the hands of the
Society without a purchaser. I consider that something on these lines
would be possible, but the Society must take the initiative in the
matter. It should be borne in mind that an immense variety of birds
is available within the sterling area. It would be quite unnecessary to
look farther.
An additional method would be to commission a collector to bring
back birds for members. There should be no insuperable difficulty
about this, if an import permit can be obtained. The Society is just
as entitled to employ a collector as the London Zoological Society.
Such a venture would be costly, for under present conditions no trip
to any part of the world would be likely to cost less than #1,000,
probably far more. Would the Society be prepared to underwrite such
a venture on a basis of salary plus expenses for the collector ? A
suitable, skilled, and reliable collector could almost certainly be found
but whether members would be prepared to accept the financial risks
is another matter. A permanent arrangement of this nature would,
I think, be most beneficial for members and they would have the
satisfaction of knowing that their birds were being brought back under
the best possible conditions. Furthermore, some measure of protection
exists in nearly all countries and colonial territories to-day, and the
necessary collecting permits would be far more likely to be obtainable
for a collector working on this basis. Under present world conditions
no collector can possibly afford to collect privately. It was a hazardous
vocation before the war when it was customary for collectors to finance
their own trips entirely. To-day any such venture would, in my opinion,
be sheer lunacy.
If on the lines suggested above, or by any other means, it should once
again be possible to import birds and to keep them in captivity in
reasonable numbers, it is essential that we should improve the whole
technique and practice of aviculture. To-day, conditions as they
existed before the war may seem like a Golden Age. I am not in
agreement with this belief. There was a splendid fagade, which
unfortunately concealed a core of varying degrees of rottenness. There
were some fine collections and some very keen and able aviculturists,
but there were various practices and beliefs which were far from ideal.
I have already touched on the wholesale mortality among birds
imported to this country. I propose to conclude this article by com-
menting on various other matters which in my opinion reflected
unfavourably on the practice of aviculture.
There was a widespread and altogether lamentable failure to

appreciate quality in birds. They were generally evaluated according
to their alleged rarity and/or according to their cost. There was much
loose thinking on the subject of rarity and the word was seldom used in
a rational sense. A rare bird, to my way of thinking, is one which is
definitely known to exist in very limited numbers in a wild state.
This generally applies either to birds with a limited island habitat,
or to large birds, the numbers of which have been seriously affected by
human agencies, generally the man with the gun. We can all think of
examples. To the former category belong the rare indigenous birds of
New Zealand and of islands everywhere ; to the latter large birds such
as the Trumpeter Swan, Californian Condor, Wattled and Whooping
Cranes. A third, and more puzzling category, consists of birds which
appear always to have been rare in a wild state, such as the various
Grebes confined to individual lakes, the peculiar Horned Coot of
Bolivia and, perhaps, the very lovely Paradise Parrakeet of Australia.
Birds belonging to all these categories can genuinely be regarded as rare
and many are in real danger of extinction. I do not, however, know
of a single example of a bird which is undoubtedly rare in a wild state
being maintained in appreciable numbers in captivity. The Trumpeter
Swan is being saved by various well thought out conservation measures
but I do not think that aviculture can claim any of the credit which
belongs to an efficient wild life preservation service. We cannot take
the credit for species maintained in a semi-feral state.
My own experience is that the so-called rarity of birds kept in
captivity has been consistently and grossly exaggerated, sometimes as
the result of pure ignorance and sometimes as the result of a perfectly
normal sales technique on the part of collectors and others who have
birds to sell. Such birds are generally rarely imported and but very
few are rare in a wild state. They are rarely imported for various
reasons. There may be a ban on their export, such as the American
Bluebirds ; their haunts may be very inaccessible, such as various
Mountain Birds of Paradise ; they may be difficult to keep in captivity,
such as certain Tyrants and Cotingas ; or there is no live bird trade
in the area which they inhabit, such as the beautiful little Red-crested
Finch [Rhodospingus gruentes) and the Celestial Parrotlet (For pus coelestis)
of Western Ecuador. Sometimes the reason is due to a combination
of these various factors. These are the prime causes which lead to a
bird being considered rare in aviculture.
Even where birds have been regarded as genuinely rare, they have
sometimes reappeared in a most peculiar way, such as the Splendid and
Queen Alexandra Parrakeets which, living in arid and sparsely
inhabited areas, escaped notice for many years until drought or a
natural, cyclical increase drove them into more generally inhabited
areas.
In no group is the belief that many species are exceedingly rare in a

wild state more widespread than among Pheasant keepers. Some
Pheasant keepers seem obsessed with the idea that it is only through
their public-spirited efforts that the more highly priced species are
being saved from extinction. My own conclusions, based on fairly
careful inquiries when at one time I thought of collecting Pheasants,
and on several years' residence in China, the home of some of the species
involved, is that with one or two doubtful exceptions, no Pheasant is
in any danger of extinction. At any rate in China, the forms most
reduced in numbers at one time were the various races of the Common
Pheasant, but due to restrictions on the use of firearms since 1937 and
the cessation in the traffic in frozen Pheasants since that date, the birds
are now more common than they have been for many years. As
regards other Chinese Pheasants, I admit that there is some evidence as
to the rarity of the Brown Crossoptilon which has a limited range in
the mountains of western Hopei and northern Shansi, and which
may have been seriously affected by deforestation, but even in this
case it should be remembered that travel through the areas which it
inhabits have become increasingly difficult ever since the first World
War, that very few ornithologists have searched for it since then, and
that for the past ten years travel in those areas has become entirely out
of the question. The Blue and the White Crossoptilons and the
Chinese Monaul are never likely to disappear, inhabiting as they do
very wild and difficult country and Reeves's Pheasant is far more
common than is generally supposed. During the war, examples were
even shot within easy walking distance of the centre of Chungking.
I do not know of any evidence of the rarity of the Amherst, Golden,
Silver, or Chinese Koklas Pheasants, and there is still plenty of wild
country in Formosa, the home of the Mikado and Swinhoe's Pheasants.
Neither La Touche's Handbook to the Birds of Eastern China nor Caldwell's
South China Birds contains any reference to the approaching extinction
of Cabot's Tragopan and Elliot's Pheasant. Indeed Caldwell makes
the following statement regarding Elliot's Pheasant :-- cc This pheasant
is well able to take care of itself and will abound in the wooded high-
lands of Fukien and Chekiang throughout time to come." Caldwell
was a first-class field observer, an American missionary with an intimate
knowledge of Fukien. He was also, if I may be allowed to digress, one
of the most astonishing game shots of all time. During the course of his
evangelical work he shot many tigers which were marauding the
countryside, on foot in grass jungle, his favourite weapon being a
very light -25 calibre Savage rifle. Would any British sportsman be
prepared to do the same ?
To revert to Pheasants, I have made these detailed comments on
Chinese Pheasants in order to show how little justification there is for
assuming that certain species of birds are exceedingly rare in a wild
state. Such alleged rarity is seldom based on references to published

observations by competent ornithologists. If the standing of the
Avicultural Magazine is to be improved, any statements of this
nature accepted for publication should always be accompanied by
references to the authorities being cited in support of such assertions.
The most serious effect of this inaccurate and misplaced obsession
with rarity is that most aviculturists will take more interest in a third-
rate example of an expensive bird than in a perfect example of a com-
moner species. A further effect is that we tend to lose sight of the fact
that many common birds are as fine and as beautiful as their more
expensive relatives. Which is intrinsically more desirable, a common
Pintail or an Eyton's Tree Duck ; an absolutely perfect example of a
Silver Pheasant or an Imperial ; a Superb Spreo Starling or a
Wallace's Bird of Paradise ; a Lavender Finch or a Royal Parrot
Finch ? The answer is, I think, that they are all equally desirable and
that everyone is entitled to personal preferences, but those preferences
should never be based on the cost factor.
I do not wish it to appear that I am not interested in rarely imported
birds. Far from it. I want to see as big a variety as possible imported.
Variety adds enormously to the interest of aviculture. The collections
which were brought in from various countries to the order of wealthy
aviculturists before the war were most valuable and stimulating. But
I do want quality and cost to be seen in their right perspective. The
man I respect and admire is one who would prefer to keep a perfect
example of a common bird than an inferior example of an expensive
one, while retaining a healthy interest in variety and novelty.
Deference to the cost factor had a peculiarly unfortunate effect on
the showing of Foreign Birds in England. I have no particular disagree-
ment with the classes provided, but the fact remains that in any class a
commonly imported bird seldom stood any chance of competing with
an expensive one and I never heard of any supreme award being won
by a common bird. This completely ignored the fact that good
quality was far more likely to be encountered in the case of a common
bird than a rarely imported one, since selection had been made from
more specimens. Most of the prizes and all the supreme awards went
to wealthy aviculturists. Individual quality, without reference to
value, was ignored. If shows are ever reorganized on a large scale I
hope that the time will come when an Orange Bishop is just as likely
to win the supreme award as a Bird of Paradise. The show system was
not one which encouraged the average keen aviculturist who kept a few
birds and was very proud of them. Some judges even dealt in foreign
birds and there were cases where prizes were awarded to a bird which
had been sold to the exhibitor by the judge. The bird may well have
deserved the prize but the class should have been judged by someone
else.

one group, family, or genus of birds, and try to keep as many species as
possible belonging to that particular group. This tendency to collect
is a very natural one, and no one suffers from it more than myself.
I am always collecting something, and as far as birds are concerned I
used to specialize in Bulbuls and the genus Sporophila. It is a good
thing in many ways. It broadens one's knowledge of any group, and
the acquisition of species not hitherto imported adds interest and zest
to one's avicultural activities. But it must be realized that a bird is
not necessarily interesting because it has not previously been imported.
The collecting mania frequently adds a spurious value to birds.
Inflated prices have often been paid for birds by aviculturists not so
much on account of the value of the bird itself, but because other
aviculturists did not yet possess it. A first importation always com-
manded a special value, but the process of reasoning which led to this
being so was not a very good one.
Possessive ness does little harm when it merely involves a wealthy
aviculturist in paying a collector a higher price than is really called
for. Indeed the avicultural world often benefited, because in this way
species from unusual localities were introduced and established, and
if they were once bred prices fell to a level where other aviculturists
could afford to purchase. The most undesirable form of possessiveness
consists of the retention of certain specimens by an aviculturist who
himself is not able to make the best possible use of the birds but does not
desire that the opportunity should be afforded to anyone else. There
is the case of a certain very beautiful rare-coloured Parrakeet which
a prominent aviculturist did everything in his power to establish by
careful breeding from his one original bird. Another aviculturist
possessed two such rare-coloured birds. He made no effort to breed
from them, would not part with them to the aviculturist who wished to
do so, and kept them confined in ordinary Parrot cages. Another case
concerned a rare and strictly protected species of island Duck which
was brought to this country by a private aviculturist. The only pair
lived for many years, doubtlessly in the best of health, but under con-
ditions where there was never the slightest likelihood that they would
ever breed. Finally one of the pair died and so disappeared all hope of
establishing the species in captivity, for it is not likely to be imported
again. No aviculturists worthy of the name should ever keep a bird if
there is some other aviculturist who can keep it better than himself,
particularly if he can breed it.
One type of collector is the aviculturist who collects medals. The
medal scheme was a sound idea when it was introduced. It was
designed to encourage the breeding of species which had hitherto not
done so in captivity. Unfortunately it all too often became an end in
itself. Many birds were bred and many medals awarded, but the value
of the reports on these successes is slight. They contain very few

original and valuable observations on breeding habits. It is also
seldom clear just what steps are taken by the Council to verify breeding
records. I do not question the fact that the birds have bred and the
young have lived to feed themselves, but I have an uneasy feeling that
there have been cases where the young one, having fed himself, has
done little more than drop down dead on the feeding tray. There is
no distinction between the award for breeding a first-class specimen
and a rickety weakling. I question whether the award of medals under
the present rules does much real good.
In breeding birds, the main criterion of success had always been the
number of birds reared, and not the quality. Every effort is made to
mass-produce birds. This is not confined to aviculture. The exponents
of mass production are most common in the poultry industry. Unfor-
tunately, it just cannot be done. Any breeding animal needs individual
attention and plenty of room in which to exercise. If either of these
factors is unduly limited there is an inevitable decline in stamina. Mass
production of poultry is leading to a serious decline in the stamina of
poultry stocks and outbreaks of all sorts of " new " diseases. It is the
same in aviculture. I have known Pheasants reared in small portable
pens until they were old enough to be placed in their aviaries, a system
which deprives the chicks of any opportunity for exercise throughout
the most vital growing period. The system has certain advantages of a
commercial nature to commend it. Natural enemies are eliminated and
a very large proportion of birds are reared to maturity with the
minimum of trouble. The resulting birds, however, are quite inferior
and contain a substantial proportion of hopeless cripples. The best
Pheasants which I have seen were permitted to roam as chicks over a
large extent of ground. They were a lot of trouble and some inevitably
were lost but the survivors were splendid specimens. The same con-
sideration applies to Waterfowl and other birds.
If birds are to be maintained in captivity, aviculturists have got to
have an outlook which can best be described as being " bloody
minded ", to regard every bird with a most critical eye, and to reject
out of hand any bird which does not measure up to the most exacting
standards. Far better from the point of view of aviculture and of the
birds themselves to destroy inferior specimens rather than to sell them
to someone who has not the knowledge or the ability to distinguish a
good bird from a bad one. If only the fittest can survive in a wild
state, it is disastrous to try and reverse the process in captivity. Our
standards are not high. Far more bad birds are bred than good ones,
and to breed from these poor specimens in their turn only results in
further deterioration in stocks. The good aviculturist is one who is
never satisfied with his own efforts. He must be in a permanent mood
of personal discontent, for ever trying to do better.
If birds and food are ever imported freely again I would like to see

a number of aviculturists try a simple experiment, to see how many
generations they can breed from one original pair of birds, say Zebra
Finches, without the introduction of fresh blood. It should be possible
to do so indefinitely, indeed I am informed that it has been done in the
case of the Chestnut-breasted Teal, but no matter how good the
original pair, I believe that the stock would deteriorate in the hands
of most aviculturists. One serious difficulty is, of course, the lack of
continuity in breeding efforts by private aviculturists. Obviously, an
aviculturist will not necessarily want to keep the same species of birds
all his life. Stocks of birds must be continually shifting between owners.
The registers which are now being compiled should perform a very
useful purpose and are a valuable innovation. I advocated something
of the sort in respect of Parrots in a letter to the Avicultural Magazine
about fifteen years ago. One danger the compilers of these registers
must try and guard against is accepting all birds as being of equal
value for breeding purposes. The registers, if they are to be of any
lasting value, should attempt to grade birds into various categories
according to their quality.
If aviculture does survive, it seems likely that most collections will
be very small with a few very big ones. It seems as if the medium income
group are suffering the biggest relative reduction in purchasing power
as a result of our present economic troubles. I hope that every possible
encouragement will be given towards the creation of large new collec-
tions if persons sufficiently interested are forthcoming. No aviculturist
should, however, receive any encouragement unless he has had practical
experience of himself caring for birds and looking after them. There is
nothing worse for aviculture than the wealthy aviculturist who can
afford to employ individuals to look after his birds and who has no
experience of the essential duties of feeding and cleaning and general
care. No aviculturist should ever have to rely on the judgment of his
curator or keeper. He should possess the necessary information and
experience himself. He should be able to do anything better than his
curator or keeper and if he cannot, it would be far better to leave birds
alone. We have been fortunate that many of our wealthy patrons of
aviculture have been first-class practical fanciers in their own right,
who have established interesting new techniques for the keeping of
unusual birds, and who sometimes have insisted on personally attending
to favourite birds themselves, despite their employment of efficient
curators. It is a valuable tradition which should be maintained.
One of the most serious tendencies which aviculturists must guard
themselves against is what I can only describe as the impact of pseudo
science. It is primarily an institutional complex but I suspect that it
is a heresy which may some day come to pervert the avicultural world.
It briefly amounts to a smug belief that our knowledge of animals is
so complete, our scientific attainments so high, that no living creature

kept in captivity can possibly die except as the result of an act of God,
and that vitamin pills and dubious inoculations are the universal
panacea for all ills. It is a phenomenon which is likely to manifest
itself in the provision of ultra-violet ray treatment for birds and animals
which, either as the result of skulking habits or living in misty hills,
rarely see the sun in a wild state. I do not decry science, but I believe
that it is a monstrous conceit to believe that our present incomplete
knowledge allows us to think that a so-called scientist is necessarily
qualified to give rulings on the requirements of birds or animals in
captivity. The greatest success has in any case always been achieved
by private persons who would not know what a vitamin was, and
care less.
No amount of semi-scientific knowledge can ever make up for the
prime requisites for any aviculturist or zoologist which are practical
experience ; attention to detail ; an understanding of the requirements
of wild animals which is partly natural, partly experience, but mostly
common sense ; and long hours of straightforward, honest to goodness
hard work. The real danger of the pseudo-scientific approach is that
it leads to the most damnable of all beliefs, that no bird or animal kept
in captivity can possibly die except from an unavoidable cause. This
belief is sanctimonious twaddle.
If any living creature is kept in captivity under artificial conditions
which eliminate the natural enemies which it would encounter in a
wild state, it must follow that unless it dies of old age, which is very
rare, death must be due to some aspect of those artificial conditions
under which it is kept. The pseudo-scientist may argue that under the
heading of natural enemies must come disease and parasites which
cannot be eliminated in captivity. I am very sceptical of this argument.
I would go so far as to say that it is far more scientific and stimulating
to regard the argument with scepticism than to accept it without demur.
I believe that the truth is that any living creature kept in captivity
which is in perfect condition is largely immune to infectious diseases
and entirely immune to the ravages of parasites, even if it is carrying
them. I believe that the same applies in a wild state too. Recorded
accounts of disease affecting an animal in a wild state generally refer
to animals which have cycles of scarcity and abundance. When
they become over abundant the subsequent over-stocking leads to a
shortage of food, malnutrition, and loss of condition, and renders them
a ready prey for any hostile microbes or bacteria which may be handy
at the time. Obviously, there are some diseases which can kill a
healthy animal in a wild state, but how many records are there of an
animal or bird dying in a wild state from one of the diseases which
commonly cause their deaths in captivity ? I do not believe that there
is any evidence on the point at all.

through my hands, in perfect condition and as fat as butter, which
were unbelievably full of worms. Your helminthologist would probably
say they were bound to die but I could find no evidence of it. Every
collector has probably had the same experience. I doubt whether many
parasites have any direct interest in killing their host. A few records
which exist of wild birds being killed by parasites generally refer to
individuals which have been storm bound or otherwise affected by
external phenomena. It is understandable then that the natural
resistance of the bird being reduced, the parasites get the upper hand
and eventually kill their host. This is what happens in captivity. A
parasite which may live naturally in an animal without doing it any
harm may very well kill it if the animal is allowed to lose condition in
captivity. The essential cause is human incompetence, nothing else.
Obviously, we are all bound to make mistakes. None of us are infallible.
The absolutely unforgivable thing is to deny the possibility of making
mistakes ; to blame, instead of ourselves, parasites, disease, the weather,
suicide on the part of the animal, " X ", or anything else.
I realize that in the course of expressing the above views, I have
probably trodden on a few avicultural toes. I make no apology for
doing so. Aviculture is at the cross-roads. It can either go forward or
disappear. The decision rests with every individual member of the
Society. But if we are going to make a new start it is essential that the
flaws and weaknesses of the old system should be clearly understood,
and I have written this article with that consideration in mind. We
have a national failing which leads us to believe that the past is
sacrosanct, that something which has been done before is of necessity
good. It is a belief that is responsible for many of our present troubles.
Let us see that it does not apply to aviculture.

Although 1947 proved to be one of the best Summers one can
remember, very few young birds were reared, but many eggs were
laid. The one outstanding success was the rearing of two Green-
winged King Parrakeets. The young left the nest on 17th July, and
up to the time of their removal from the parents (6th October), they
were still being fed by the parents.

Queen Alexandra Parrakeets. --One pair reared four young
from the first clutch of eggs. At the second attempt seven eggs were
laid. Five of these were fertile, but unfortunately none hatched out.
The second pair had one clutch of three, which were infertile.
Leadbeater's Cockatoos. --These were most disappointing, as
they gave up incubating the day before the eggs were due to hatch.
All the eggs contained perfectly formed chicks. At the second
attempt they only incubated for six days.
Ringneck Parrakeets. --Also very disappointing this year. Only
three young were reared, two lutinos and the third one a green.
A Crimson-winged hen paired to a Green-winged King cock laid
four eggs. All infertile. A lutino Ringneck paired to a lutino-bred
Alexandrine also laid, but all the eggs were infertile.
In the small bird aviaries very few young ones were reared--it was
not until their second attempt that the Rothschild's Grackle reared
one young, which brings my total to six. I hope to have luck in
breeding these very rare birds again next year.
Malabar Starlings. --One young was reared from the first nest,
and the second nest was destroyed, and both eggs were broken. A hen
Triangular Spotted Pigeon paired to a cock Snow Pigeon, reared four
young from three nests. We now have seven of these beautiful hybrids.
A pair of Bronzewinged Pigeons must surely hold the record for the
number of eggs laid this season. Unfortunately they will not incubate,
and the same applies to the Crested Pigeons and Necklace Doves.
Other birds that attempted to nest were Superb Starlings, Pagoda
Starlings, and Pekin Robins. No ornamental Pheasants were reared
this year, although numerous eggs were laid. The Mikado Pheasant
did get as far as hatching two young, which only lived for four days.
In the big animal enclosure the full winged Mandarin Ducks reared
a good many young, but very few Carolinas were reared. Four
Ruddy-headed Geese were reared, and a good many Pea chicks.
This is the first year I have not reared any Cranes. A good many
eggs were laid, but owing to the very cold spring all the eggs were
frozen. The birds that give me the greatest pleasure are my Indian
Chukor Partridges. I still have about twenty round the house,
always coming up to be fed and roosting on the top of the house.
They breed well, but the cats destroy most of the young birds.

Mr. Prestwich, having exhorted all who keep Parrakeets to record
their breeding successes in these days of great scarcity, and being
myself fully in agreement, the following notes for 1947 are offered to
encourage those whose achievements are greater than my modest
contributions.
The season just past will, I think, be generally regarded as dis-
appointing. It might not have been unreasonable to expect a big
output of young birds by way of compensation for the cruel winter
which destroyed so many, at least of the wild birds. On the contrary,
there appears to have been an unwelcome amount of infertility even
amongst old established breeding pairs. The severe and prolonged
cold may possibly have had nothing to do with this for I was interested
to read that Colonel Tendon reported on similar lines. Whilst infertility
with my own birds was not unusually apparent there was a certain
amount of dead in shell.
In all six pairs of Parrakeets laid forty-three eggs, four of which
were not incubated and two misshapen. Therefore from a possible
thirty-seven, twenty-six young were certainly hatched and twenty
birds reared to maturity. The eggs which failed to hatch were almost
equally divided between clear, addled, and dead in shell.
Records of individual pairs were as follows :--
Golden-mantled Rosellas. --This, a tried and trusted pair, produced
their usual two broods, eight young reaching maturity.
Mealy Rosellas .--For the first time for many years one clutch of
eggs only was laid from which three young were reared.
Stanleys .---Like the last two pairs this one has reared many young
in past years. The usual six eggs were laid, five of which hatched.
Passing the aviary one morning when the young were about ten days
old I threw a strawberry to the old birds. A few hours later I found
the brood in great distress, one dead and the remainder apparently
about to follow. Changing the nest bed and withholding of green food
corrected the trouble and four young eventually left the nest to be
successfully reared.

The experiment, which I propose repeating next season, has shown
that the incubation period is exactly seventeen days.
It is interesting to note that a cock of last season's breeding shows
the completely developed spatule on the third primary which is con-
trary to the statement recorded by Cayley in Australian Parrots , p. 137,
that this is not acquired until long after the bird has reached adult
plumage. It has not been my experience that this species undergoes
a complete moult during the first autumn. Cf. Tavistock's Parrots ,
p- 2 65-
Crimson Wings .--The third egg of the first clutch was misshapen,
two were clear, and the remaining egg contained a dead chick.
I feared the hen would not make a second attempt, but she did finally
complete a similar clutch. Again the third egg was misshapen, but
two young were successfully reared from the remainder. They were
exceptionally fine specimens, and from their size one at least should
prove to be a hen and a mate for an unrelated cock that came into
colour this season. That, however, remains to be seen ; I defy anyone
to sex an immature bird with certainty.
Kings .--Four eggs were laid but the hen did not sit.
Barnard&amp;apos;s and Pennant&amp;apos;s did not get as far as eggs, one could hardly
blame one pair of the latter which are last season's birds and for
whom no nest was provided ! Both these species, like the Kings, did
not, however, have a fair chance as they were moved to new aviaries,
which had been only finished at some expense and considerable
labour in January.

When the above Registry was planned it was thought that very few
Ornamental Pheasants, etc., remained in confinement in this country.
All known fanciers and zoological institutions were circularized, with the
result that far from a gloomy outlook, it has been found that there are
no less than 1,200 birds of 34 species still flourishing here. There are,
however, many large estates where these birds enjoy full liberty and
therefore no record is available. Nevertheless the results are most en-
couraging, and with another breeding season not far off certain species
may again become well established. It will be remembered that
mention was made of interbreeding between Golden and Amherst

Pheasants with a corresponding threat to the purity of each species.
These two species are amongst the largest in numbers recorded in this
census, and fanciers have co-operated by stating if their birds are of
pure or impure stock. It is thought that there are doubtless numbers
of these birds which the owners in good faith have recorded as pure,
whereas expert examination may prove otherwise. Unfortunately
it is an almost impossible task to prove the pedigree of all the birds
registered so that a little latitude must be allowed with the figures
given against these two species. Pure strains of Amherst certainly
exist, notably in the collections of Gapt. Scott-Hopkins, Mr. Wilford
Smith, and the Duke of Bedford, and credit should be given to these
enthusiasts for the care they have exercised in keeping them thus.
The major problem still appears to be feeding, although from
personal experience I do not find this so. My remaining bird, a cock
Amherst, has kept in fine condition the past few years on a diet con-
sisting mainly of raw carrot, fruit in season, table scraps and plenty of
greenstuff and consequently, I think, that grain has been a little over-
rated in the past. I agree that corn is certainly beneficial in cold
weather and also to laying hens, and suggest that fanciers should
conserve for this purpose any they may obtain. Articles in the Pheasant
number of this magazine tend to bear me out on the foregoing remarks,
but perhaps some well-known authority can be induced to tell us his
experiences, past and present, of feeding a number of birds and the
corresponding effects the changes of diet have had.
Another frequent reason one finds for the decline in Pheasant
enthusiasts is that of aviaries in sad need of repair. Material is difficult
to obtain these days, and that obtainable is for the most part of
inferior quality. Wood is unseasoned and splits very easily, and the
quantity allowed for #1 is negligible. Further, the price of birds is
now somewhat high. I am able to quote a few prices at present asked,
by which it will be seen that the average fancier cannot hope to extend
his activities through lack of means. One is lucky to obtain Silvers at
#4, Goldens # 6, and Amhersts at #8 a pair. Usually they are a pound
or two higher. For some of the rarer species, figures are as follows :--

These figures are a great setback to lovers of these birds, and many
are prevented from obtaining mates for odd birds for this reason.
Consequently a bird that may have produced double or treble its kind
in a season is wasted.

The result is that the bird in question has now been definitely established as the

T. R. HOLMES WATKINS-PARRAKEET BREEDING RESULTS, 1 947 25
Briefly, the species are established as follows :--
Golden .---Some 74 pairs and trios are recorded, the balance being
chiefly odd males and a few young unsexed.
Amherst --This species is not so strongly represented as the above,
there being approximately 32 pairs and trios. Balance : as Golden.
There are in addition a few running loose at Woburn, of which no
figures are available.
Silver. ---This, the commonest of the Kaleege Pheasants, is represented
by some 51 pairs and trios. Balance : as the foregoing species.
Bel&amp;apos;s.-- Only one, a female, is recorded, the property of Mrs.
Reynolds-Sams.
Lineated. --A trio only, in the aviaries of Mr. G. A. Betting.
Horsjield&amp;apos;s.-- Regent&amp;apos;s Park have the only recorded birds of this
species.
White-crested Kaleege. \0x25A0--The only pair recorded are at Whipsnade.
Swinhoe&amp;apos;s. --It is to be regretted that this lovely species is not more
numerous. There are 7 pairs and a few odd birds.
Edward&amp;apos;s .--19 pairs and trios are on record, together with a few odd
males and young.
Reeves&amp;apos;s.-- It was at first thought that this species no longer remained
with us, but as records came in it was found that at least 15 pairs and
trios existed together with a few odd males. There are also a few at
liberty at Woburn, and again no figures can be given.
Elliot&amp;apos;s.- --Once fairly common, the Elliot's, I am sorry to say, is now
represented by only three male birds. A pair (the only one) was in
the Whipsnade collection, but Dr. Vevers has since advised me of the
loss of these, attributed to a weasel. A very few are at liberty at Woburn
from whom future stocks appear to depend.
Mikado .--There are some 10 pairs and trios together with a number
of odd males and young.
Copper .---A male Soemmering's at Regent's Park is the sole represen-
tative of this group.
Impeyan. --It is pleasing to record some 10 pairs of this magnificent
species and results show that it is maintaining its numbers. Leckford
reared 24 young the past season.
Temminck&amp;apos;s.- --A fine stock of these Tragopans still exists and appear
to be established safely. Leckford have done exceptionally well,
rearing some 20 young. In addition they have 10 pairs of adult birds,
and a further 10 pairs and some odd and young ones are distributed
in various collections.
Blyth&amp;apos;s.-- Two males and one female represent this species. They are
in the Whipsnade and Regent's Park collections.
Cabot&amp;apos;s.-- The only bird, a female, is at Leckford.
Satyr. --There are 4 pairs still in the country. Leckford have 2 pairs,
Gapt. Scott-Hopkins and Whipsnade 1 each.

26 T. R. HOLMES WATKINS-PARRAKEET BREEDING RESULTS, 1947
Firebacks. --This group is represented by only one bird, a female
Malayan-crested in the Regent's Park collection.
Eared Pheasants .--The Blue appear to be the most prolific, Whipsnade
having reared i o young and Leckford 11. There are 5 adult pairs and
some odd males. Brown are represented by 4 pairs and two odd birds,
and White by a male only in the aviaries at Hesketh Park, Southport.
BulwePs. --Regent's Park possess the only bird recorded, a female.
Peacock Pheasants. --Leckford have the majority of Germain's, 4 male
and 2 female. Regent's Park have a male. The Grey is more estab-
lished, there being 6 pairs, and a few odd birds, also 3 young reared
at Leckford. In addition, Regent's Park have a pair of the form, var.
bakeri. The only representatives of the Palawan are at Leckford.
Argus Pheasants .--There are only three birds recorded, all at Regent's
Park. They are females, of which one is a Malayan and two Crested.
Peafowl. --There are still a fair number of these birds about, and
doubtless many more remain of which we have no record. The
Indian and Black-shouldered appear to be the most prolific, 21 and
23 young respectively having been reared during the past season.
Specifer are in low numbers, mainly owing to their being unable to
stand the rigours of our winter, and the feet are extremely susceptible
to frostbite. The White form is represented by a pair and two young at
Foxwarren, the others, mostly males, are distributed in the various
collections.
Junglefowl .--The Red is the only member of this group still kept in
England, and they are steadily maintaining their numbers, some 25
young resulting from last season's breedings.
Hybrids. --I will not dwell on these as they are of little interest to
the average enthusiast apart from their colourings.
On looking through the foregoing list, it will be noticed that certain
names stand out, and I think a special mention should be made of
these. Outstanding amongst them is Leckford, without doubt still the
largest and most varied private collection in the country. Mr. Terry
Jones, the curator, is to be complimented on maintaining such a large
number under the prevailing conditions of the past few years, and
still further honours should be his for the number of young he has
succeeded in rearing. On looking through the records I find that there
are no less than 200 birds of 15 species kept at Leckford, including 120
young reared last season. Certainly an achievement and one of which
enthusiasts particularly should applaud, as no doubt many of these birds
will in due course find their way into the numerous depleted aviaries
in this country. Other fine collections worthy of note are those of
Gapt. Scott-Hopkins comprising 44 birds of 12 species, R. S. Hirst
with 37 birds of 10 species, and Mrs. Reynolds-Sams, who has 37
birds of 9 species. As may be expected the Zoological Society have
well-stocked aviaries of Pheasants, and special attention is now being

paid to breeding, chiefly at Whipsnade. Records show 258 birds of
18 species at Whipsnade and of these 57 are young reared last season.
Regent's Park have 84 birds of 23 species.
I approached the Board of Trade regarding importations, and the
following reply was received.
" With reference to your letter of the 13th October regarding the
proposed importation of Ornamental Pheasants, Peafowl, Junglefowl,
and/or eggs by purchase or exchange from the Continent or U.S.A.,
I am to say that on advice received by the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries the importation of birds and/or eggs is not permitted at the
present time.
" It is therefore regretted that the Department is unable to issue
the necessary import authority for this purpose."
No doubt a few birds may arrive through the agencies of the Zoo-
logical Society or professional dealers, but supplies for the most part
must for some time to come depend on fanciers themselves. I am
willing to continue acting as liaison between fanciers for the exchange
or sale of surplus birds and will appreciate notification of all fresh
acquisitions, requirements, etc.
In conclusion may I tender my thanks to all concerned for the close
co-operation they have afforded me, and in particular I would like
to express my gratitude to Mr. Prestwich, Mr. Beever, and Capt.
Scott-Hopkins for the help they have so freely given in many ways.
I am also indebted to Dr. Vevers for placing his records at my disposal
during a visit to Regent's Park.

I have in the garden here at Mombasa a large tree with, I should
think, roughly, between three and four hundred nests. These nests
are very compactly woven and are mostly suspended from the very
tips of the branches. As yet there are hardly any leaves on the tree,
which, of course, makes it much easier to watch the birds' nest-building
and courtship, etc. The cocks only appear to make the nests and the
hens help line them. The cocks fly in small flocks of twenty or forty
very rapidly to some particular spot in the garden for nesting material.
Palm leaf seems very popular to construct the outside of the nest. The
method used is to land on the tip of the leaf, hang on and pull until
it is the required length, then cut it across--sometimes the strips look

quite 8 or io in. long. Usually these palm strips are, I think, about
5 in. long, that is from what one could see--I never measured any of
the fallen ones, so often dropped when a cock returns with a strip and
is attacked by another cock on landing. Grasses of various sorts are
also being used, particularly one very soft grass which seems to grow
only on paths and very sandy soil. The lining of the nest appears to be
made of the leaf of what looks like some species of mimosa, with a
very pretty vermilion and yellow flower. The combings from the
Alsatian dog were much sought after, but only by the hens. I never once
saw a cock use this lining. The noise from the tree where this colony
of Weavers are nesting has to be heard to be believed---not unlike a
colony of Starlings. The cocks fight like mad, chiefly over nesting
material, frequently falling locked together by feet and beak. The
cock's courtship consists of a few rapid hops sideways along a branch,
quivering his wings and singing his rasping little " song " (if, indeed,
it can be called this !) very rapidly. He also hangs upside down from
the nest entrance, rapidly flapping his wings and swaying from side
to side--as a rule this lasts roughly for about a minute--but is repeated
at frequent intervals. The new nests are often woven on to the old
nests, the latter, having become rotten with age, frequently give way
and fall to the ground, as the old material cannot stand the strain of
the weight of the two nests. The ground under the tree is literally
littered with old and new nests joined together and broken eggs.
The eggs are rather large for the size of the bird, a Starling-coloured
blue, mostly rather heavily mottled at the blunt end, with a reddish
brown. Some of the eggs I saw were speckled all over ; once I saw a
clear blue egg with no markings at all. The general appearance of the
cock bird from a distance is as follows. Black head and bib ; eye, ruby
colour ; back, wings, and tail Sparrow-coloured ; the remainder bright
lemon yellow. The hens resemble a hen Sparrow, with a greenish
yellow " wash The young cocks resemble a hen Sparrow in colour.
These latter were building nests in a separate tree and none of the
adult birds appeared to take any notice of them, but a good deal of
bickering went on between themselves ! I should say the size of the
birds is about half as large again as an adult Sparrow, may be a bit
larger. The flight is rapid and they usually plane " up to the perch
they are about to land on. The cocks seem to go on building, even when
their mates are sitting, until the young are hatched, when their real
work starts. I think as yet (14th March) there are only a very few
with young--and those only just hatched. One curious fact I watched.
I saw a cock and hen mate ; directly the cock got off the hen she popped
into the nest and stayed there about a minute. This happened three
or four times in rapid succession. The last time of mating the cock
hung suspended from the nest bottom while the hen remained inside.
This is the last I saw of them for I left Mombasa the next day.

Well, now to my story. I have kept foreign birds solely for their
beauty or song, or both, for nearly fifty years, ranging from Grey
Singing Finches to the choicest of the Tanagers, and in that time I have
many recollections of quaint and amusing incidents which must of
necessity vary with every member.
For instance, have you ever given ten shillings for a dead bird ?
(By the way, I am referring to the days when ten shillings were ten
shillings !) Well, neither have I--quite. But when Jacob came to
live with me he was more dead than alive, and his plumage resembled
the modern girls' swim-suits. I have rather a soft spot for the down-
and-outs, so I parted with this sum to the late Mr. Chapman and
home we went. The only part of Jacob reasonably clothed was his
wings, so he went into quarantine for a month to be built up. At
the end of that time his cage was transferred to the aviary for a few
days, so that he could get accustomed to his surroundings, and it was
then placed on the floor, the door was opened, and out Jacob hopped.
I have a rooted dislike of having food vessels on the floor and these
are therefore all in glass containers, each fixed at the end of a metal
arm, like the spokes of a wheel, so that there is at least a foot between
each vessel. Well, Jacob was even weaker than I thought for, although
he made valiant efforts to fly up to the food he failed lamentably to
reach his objective, so there was Jacob on the floor and the food
about 18 inches above his nose. Now what was to be done ? Well
Jacob would evidently have to go back into quarantine or -?
Yes, the or had it. I built a ladder--Jacob's ladder, you see ?--up
which he very thankfully clambered his way to sustenance, and this
perforce had to be his life-line for quite a while. With the moult,
however, a new and very glossy Jacob emerged--by the way Jacob was
a Red-shouldered Whydah--and disdaining his ladder flew happily
to his eats. The life-line, of course, was no longer required, and if
I afterwards mentioned ladder to Jacob he adopted an indignant air
and looked " What ladder ? "

<bodyText confidence="0.998144222222222" page_id="56311385"  page_num="30" year="" vol="">
Talking of Whydahs reminds me of a quaint proceeding on the
part of a cock Giant Whydah I had. It had attained its full bridal
plumage, and the urge to pay court to one of the feminine sex was at
times evidently overpowering, so much so that he used to pin a small
Weaver in a corner of the aviary and go through his very dignified
and rather beautiful performance of bobs and bows before his
inamorata. The Weaver appeared positively mesmerized by the
gallantry of its resplendent suitor, and made no attempt to escape
from its unusual position. Apart from the intimate glimpse it gave me
of Whydah courtship it at least solved the question of the sex of the
Weaver, for I gave the Whydah sufficient ornithological knowledge to
know that his offering was only made to one of the opposite sex.
After some minutes of pirouetting and bowing the Giant would give
a final bob and fly away, much apparently to the relief of the Weaver,
which then departed hurriedly, apparently glad to find itself still alive.
Another amusing incident which remains in my memory refers to
a Golden-fronted Fruitsucker. In the crossbar of the door of the
flight, which incidentally faced the french windows of the breakfast
room, I secured two holders about 2 feet apart and fixed between
them, all unsuspecting the trap I was making, a round perch. This
perch was some 3 inches away from the crossbar, in which I had
screwed about four ordinary right-angled dresser hooks and upon which
I fixed pieces of apple, orange, banana, etc. One of the most regular
visitors was the Fruitsucker I have mentioned, and judging from
his satisfied demeanour he seemed to think he had discovered a
heavenly bird larder. Well, all went well for some time until one
fine day the ends of the perch, having become smooth with friction,
began to move under the weight of the bird. At first this only entailed
a continual dance as the Golden Front sought to maintain his equili-
brium, but after a while the ends got so smooth that it gave the bird
no chance to remain upright, but just turned slowly over with him.
Those who have held a Golden-fronted Fruitsucker will remember
the tight clutch with which the bird holds on to one's fingers, and
this same trait evidently forbade the bird to leave go of the perch.
The look of comical " Where am I " surprise on the Fruitsucker's
face as he felt himself being carried away from his beloved fruit and
the amazed expression when he found himself upside down was
worth seeing. But it takes a good deal to disconcert a Golden-fronted
Fruitsucker, and after pondering over the situation for a moment
he pulled himself up the other side, thereby looping the loop, and
then balancing himself precariously on the betraying perch he
resumed his meal. After a while he seemed quite to enjoy the sensation
of the " merry-go-round ", so I left the perch in its loosened con-
dition for him to amuse himself on.
Mention of this bird recalls a Shama which for a while, when they

were both in quarantine, was in the next cage to the Fruitsucker.
As those of our members who have kept the bird know, a Shama
would sell his soul for a mealworm, and I would sometimes open the
door of his cage and throw these delectable insects into the air for
the pleasure of seeing him catch them--and he very rarely missed.
I tried the same game with the Fruitsucker, but he made no attempt
to capture the morsel in mid-air, although he was quite a good catcher
if the mealworms were thrown directly at him. One day by some
mischance the two birds were out together, and after giving the
Shama his mealworm, another was thrown to the Fruitsucker. It
doesn't take a Shama long to dispose of this dainty--a bite, a gulp,
and it's gone. The dignified Fruitsucker, however, likes to savour the
" bouquet " of his mealworm and makes quite a performance of it.
Well, the Fruitsucker picked up his worm and was proceeding to
manipulate it to his liking when the Shama, like the black and brown
thunderbolt his name is supposed to represent, pounced on the
struggling insect, then firmly held in the Fruitsucker's beak, and a
tug-of-war began for possession. I suppose the skin of the mealworm
must have been rather old for it did not part readily, and there were
the two birds each struggling to obtain the coveted prize. Neither,
having got a grip, dared open his beak to secure a larger portion in
case his opponent secured the worm ! Round and round they waltzed,
looking blue murder at each other the while, until at last the inevitable
happened and the luckless animal was pulled into two pieces. After
this it was useless to let them out together for a fly round and a meal-
worm--the Shama watched the Fruitsucker like a hawk, but he never
attempted any liberties except when a mealworm was the prize,
and then he threw discretion to the winds and went to it. I have
had several specimens of each of these birds, but I never found the
Shama as confiding as the Fruitsucker--the latter would come on
to one's finger quite willingly for a mealworm, but the Shamas
preferred them thrown into the air, and they were all adept at
catching.
The tameness of foreign birds--principally the insectivorous and
fruit-eating species--is a delightful trait in their nature. One of
the most confiding I had was a young Spotted Emerald Tanager
which, from the first day he was let out into the aviary, flew on to
my hand in the most confiding way, without waiting for an invitation,
and would not only take a mealworm from my palm but would stand
there and eat it. It apparently thought it was safer there than taking
the morsel away, and it was probably right !
As an exact antithesis of the Emerald Tanager what a delightfully
unsatisfactory inmate of an aviary is a Rainbow Bunting. His wonder-
fully soft but striking colours are a sheer delight--when you can see
them--for he is an adept at hiding himself; but I must confess

" personality " is not his strong point. He really carried shyness to
excess, although I suppose it was a natural trait, as his colours pro-
bably made him too conspicuous in his native woods.
One of the most charming of the larger birds was a Royal Starling,
which never tired of flying backwards and forwards between the
aviary and the flight--a matter of 70 feet--and he used to take a
delight in gliding just over the heads of some of the other inmates
which were sitting on branches and which had to crouch down to
avoid the sweep of the Starling's wings. Although so large in com-
parison with some of the others, I found him a most gentle bird, and
he never molested even the smallest, while his size protected him
against others. He made a gorgeous sight when the sun shone on his
back feathers, although I don't know that he was not equalled by a
Superb Starling which was in the aviary with him. They both had
a favourite perch at the end of the flight which opened out into the
" forest "--thickly planted with Cotoneaster frigida --but the Royal
always gave way to the Superb. I soon found that the latter was a
hen, and I feel sure they would have bred if I had been able to give
them a place to themselves, as they agreed perfectly.
To leave the brilliantly coloured birds for a moment and go to the
other extreme. I suppose there is hardly a more modestly clad bird
than the Grey Singing Finch, but he certainly has something which
most of the others have not got. I refer, of course, to his song. I was
so pleased with this that I bought several more Greys, only to learn
that even a fair sized aviary is not big enough to house two cock Grey
Singing Finches. Singing, fighting, chasing, tormenting, the stronger
gave the others no rest until he was again the undisputed " cock of
the walk And cheek ! I have seen a Grey grip the long tail of a
Whydah and literally swing on it till he was tired, while the owner
gazed helplessly at the indignity to which he was subjected some 12 to
18 inches below his beak.
And talking of cheek, is any bird more chock full of cheek and pluck
for his size than a Zebra Finch ? The size of the opposite number is
immaterial--if the Zebra is in the right mood he will tackle the
biggest " Joe Louis " amongst them, sounding his " penny tin trumpet "
vigorously the while and more often than not driving his opponent
away by sheer pertinacity.
Among the smallest birds surely one of the most beautiful when in
colour is the Yellow-winged Sugar Bird. At one time I had four of
these morsels, living jewels a lady friend called them, and although
they agreed quite well amongst themselves, sometimes they would
indulge in a quaint battle with uplifted beaks and threatening gestures,
but they never did any harm. And although such mites, I never saw
any other bird attempt to molest them. I used to think that the
scimitar-like beak gave thoughtful pause to any would-be attacker.

MRS. G. T. CLARK&amp;apos;--BREEDING RESULTS FOR 1947 33
The expression I have mentioned of living jewels reminds me that
a good many years ago the landscape gardener who laid out most of
my garden asked if he could bring a Dutch gardening friend to have
a look round. Of course I readily agreed, but the most startling-
incident of his visit to my mind had only an indirect connection with
horticultural matters. When he came to the aviary he stood entranced
at the ever changing flow of colours as the birds flew backwards and
forwards, and then gently breathed--" Flying Flowers. 55 When I tell
you the gentleman in question was almost as broad as he was long
and must have weighed anything from 18 to 20 stone, to hear such
a beautiful and poetical expression from such a large body seemed
utterly incongruous. Said my landscape gardener afterwards :
" When he gets back to Holland he will have an aviary of his own, 55
but whether he ever did or not I never heard.
While mentioning persons rather than birds, although there is
a direct connection, a friend who was a great lover of horses asked
me how much the aviary had cost to build. " Round about a hundred
and fifty, 55 I replied. " A hundred and fifty, 55 he gasped. " Why,
good heavens ! You could have built a stable for that. 55 Which just
shows you !
And so, looking back across the vista of the years, one could go
on drawing on memories, memories, memories, until one's readers
got weary of reading about nothing in particular, but only silhouettes
of incidents that happened and passed--sometimes in a flash--and
before that wearisome state is reached (" reminuisances 55 another
friend called them) I will end these few desultory notes and re-live
myself the very happy and delightful days they brought me.

The Chairman in welcoming Madame Derscheid and her son paid
tribute to the scientific work of the late Dr. J. M. Derscheid, particu-
larly his contributions to aviculture. In addition to his sound scientific
knowledge, Dr. Derscheid had a great appreciation of beauty, was no
mean artist and had largely added to the interest and value of his
papers by the illustrations. She recalled his great love for England
and his many visits to this country where he had made numerous
friends, and expressed the deep gratitude that was felt for his work in
assisting the escape of British airmen during the war which had cost
him his life. So great was his interest in aviculture that during the
years of imprisonment preceding his death he had written and illus-
trated a large number of articles which had been published in Belgium
during the German occupation and were now being translated and
published in the Avicultural Magazine. The illustrations were
being copied by his son Jean-Pierre as only one original remained,
that of the Kea, which was reproduced on the souvenir menu of the
dinner. Miss Barclay-Smith concluded with the following words :
" Madame, we are greatly honoured by the presence of yourself
and your son to-night and to have the opportunity of paying tribute
to the memory of your husband, Dr. Derscheid. As a scientist and
above all in the avicultural world he has done the most valuable work
and his death is an irreparable loss. We are very glad to see in your
son the promise of a scientist of equal eminence as his father, and on
him we place great hopes for the future. We wish to express to the
Derscheid family and through them to the whole of the Escape
Service of Belgium our heartfelt thanks for the assistance they gave
and the sacrifices they made for our country and our countrymen

during the war ; it is a proof of friendship that we can never forget.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you the toast c Madame Derscheid,
Jean-Pierre Derscheid and all that they represent of the friendship of
Belgium for Great Britain '."
In reply Monsieur Jean-Pierre Derscheid thanked the British
Aviculturists' Club for the honour that had been conferred upon him
and his mother and for the tributes that had been paid to the memory
of his father, and said that he was proud that he had inherited his
father's love for England.
The Chairman, in introducing Mr. Walter Higham, said that as
this was a special occasion Mr. Prestwich, the Hon. Secretary, had
been anxious to provide a really worthy entertainment. He had
therefore asked Mr. Higham, who in colour photography was second
to none, to show his colour film " Hungarian Featherland ".
Mr. Higham then showed his film and said that Miss Barclay-Smith
had accompanied him to Hungary and helped him with its produc-
tion ; she had also undertaken all the complicated organization
necessary for such a trip, which had taken three weeks, during which
they had travelled over 2,000 miles.
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.837500714285714" page_id="56311393"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
" Hungarian Featherland " was made with the co-operation of the
International Committee for Bird Preservation, and had the full
assistance of the Royal Hungarian Institute of Ornithology. The
subjects included such birds as Great White Heron, Purple Heron,
Black Tern, Spoonbill, Golden Oriole, Moustached Warbler, Stork,
Marsh Harrier, Tawny Pipit, Bee-eater, Hoopoe, Collared Flycatcher,
Blackwinged Stilt, Avocet, Kentish Plover, Little Bittern, Ruff, and

Reeve, etc. Slow motion studies of bird-flight are one of the features
of this film. Apart from birds there were interesting glimpses of
Hungarian life, including a gipsy village, and the horses and cattle
that roam the Hortabagy. It is no exaggeration to describe this film
as " A triumph of colour photography ", and Mr. Higham justly
deserved the generous applause he received.
Before the meeting Miss Knobel presented Madame Derscheid with
a bouquet of red carnations, tied with the Belgian national colours, on
behalf of the Club.
At the close of the meeting Miss Knobel said she was sure she was
voicing the opinion of all members in congratulating Mr. Prestwich
on the great success of the Club which was entirely due to his efforts.
It had put new life into the Avicultural Society. They all owed him
a great debt of gratitude. This was followed by sustained applause.
Arthur A. Prestwich,
Hon. Secretary.
The date of the next meeting is 10th March, 1948.

At the present time the old birds are in the process of rearing five young.
Queen Alexandra Parrots have maintained their value of #5 or #6 each throughout
the years, so it will be readily seen that these two birds have certainly earned their
board and residence at the Zoo.
They are exceedingly tame, and to an almost embarrassing extent, for they often
alight on Head Bird Keeper H. Manfield when he enters their cage, and care must
be taken to see that they have been displaced before leaving.
One of these Parrots is a wild bird captured at the Hermannsburg Mission in
1945. The origin of the other is unknown.
Dove and Pigeon Registry in U.S.A.
Mr. W. R. Kern is conducting a census and registry of all foreign Doves and
Pigeons kept in the U.S.A. He says they are none too plentiful, and that some
stocks are in danger of dying out. In this country the Order Columbiformes never
seems to have attained the popularity its members deserve, and at the present time,
thanks mainly to feeding difficulties, their numbers must be very few indeed. Inci-
dentally, an advertiser in Cage Birds asks for offers for an " American Passenger
Pigeon, moulted, fine specimen The discovery of a Passenger Pigeon would
cause quite a flutter in the ornithological dove-cot !
A. A. P.
Inquiry revealed the fact that the bird was indeed a specimen of Ectopistes migratorius,
but a stuffed one ; a printer's error had changed " mounted " to " moulted ".

Broken Bones in Pheasants
It might be thought that it would be a troublesome matter to set a bird's broken
leg, but there appears to be little difficulty, judging by my experience this year (1947).
I set a dozen Pheasant's eggs, six Golden, and six Silver, under a broody hen.
Unfortunately, seven were unfertile, two weakly chicks died in the shell, and only
three hatched normally, all Silvers. I put them in a coop along with the broody, a
Rhode Island-Light Sussex cross, with a delightful disposition, but considerable
weight. All was going well until the third morning, when I found one of the chicks
with a broken leg. The break was practically in the middle of the tarsus, and I
thought I might be able to set it. I used half-inch surgical adhesive tape, several
thicknesses round the leg to make it firm. I made a little coop and run for the chick,
and it appeared fairly contented during the day, and ate quite well. In the evening,
however, it became so unsettled and woebegone that I had to put it back to the
broody. In the morning I found the other leg broken. So much for my soft-hearted-
ness. This was a bad break, low down near the foot, but I managed to make it fairly
firm with tape. The chick was a wonderful patient, hardly making a movement,
and silent except for an occasional " shrill " when I was setting the leg. It just
had to stay in its little coop now, as it could not walk. The coop was taken indoors
every night for warmth. The chick was a splendid co-operator, and fed and drank
well. Chickweed and small worms were favourites. I do not care to give chicks
worms as a rule, but I had to keep the mite's appetite healthy and keep it growing.
In a few days I could see an improvement in the first break, but the second seemed
worse, the foot swelling very badly. In ten days the bone of the first leg appeared
to have knitted, while the second break still showed bad swelling, although the chick
could move all its toes. After this, however, improvement was seen daily, and
within a month I had the tapes off. The first break was set so well that there was
absolutely no sign of a join, while the second knitting can be seen only when the
bird is in hand. I put the chick back to the big coop where it proceeded to fight,
and defeat, the other two ! The broody took it to her heart, as a matter of course ;
a wonderful hen, she had the poults as tame and gentle as herself.
This was not to be the end of the breakages, however. About the end of September
I handed the birds over to their ultimate home, and in their excitement at having a
large aviary they started flying about. They were now three months old, and very
well grown. One was seen to be unable to use a leg, and I was asked to go and see
what was wrong. This was not my friend " Splinty ", but one of the others, and
the worst break yet, compound, in the middle of the tarsus, skin and scutes broken
and bleeding. I treated it with an antiseptic, and again used the adhesive tape,
much more of it this time. The foot swelled very badly, and the patient was too
active, but after about three weeks it began to put its foot to the ground and put a
little weight on the leg. Daily improvement continued, and now the leg is perfectly
sound and straight, although the join can be seen. In nature I have seen broken
limbs mended, but usually the join is off the straight. Loss of a foot is not fatal to a
Pheasant in the wild. I have seen a number, in fat condition, with only a stump
left, obviously having been caught in a gin trap.

The National Cage Bird Show
The National Exhibition of Cage Birds was held at the Royal Horticultural Hall
on 4th, 5th, and 6th December, 1947. It was organized by Cage Birds for the benefit
of the Soldiers', Sailors', and Airmen's Help Society. The Foreign Section attracted
103 entries--an increase of 43 on last year--and was judged by K. A. Norris. The
National Award of Merit for the best Foreign Bird and the National Foreign Bird
Silver Trophy were awarded to G. C. Lynch for his Blue Satin Bower Bird--a bird
we have seen on numerous occasions, but never looking better.
The Psittacine classes were not supported to the extent one could have wished.
The five classes produced only 28 entries. The winners were : E. F. Benjamin's
Masked Lovebirds, C. Laidlaw's Stanley Parrakeet, E. G. Gumbrell's Pennant's
Parrakeets, P. A. Birch's King Parrakeets, and Mrs. F. Riley's Red-and-Blue Macaw.
There were twenty-five entries in the common Waxbills, Mannikins, etc. class,
and this was won by Mrs. L. Scamell's St. Helena Waxbills, followed byH. Metcalf's
Three-coloured Mannikins and T. Crewes's Orange-cheeked Waxbills. In Gouldian

The largest class, 27 entries, was that for Grassfinches, and the rarer small seed-
eaters not previously classified. T. Crewes gained the first half-dozen or so awards ;
his Red-headed Parrot Finches, Melba Finches, Pectoral Finches, and Silver Zebra
Finches heading his magnificent team. Mrs. Scamell registered a second win in the
Small Insectivorous Bird Class with a good pair of Zosterops, second, perhaps rather
unluckily, being T. Crewes's Crimson-breasted Barbet ; another pair of Zosterops
(J. E. Davis) was third. The Larger Insectivorous Bird Class contained but five
entries, first being G. G. Lynch&amp;apos;s Blue Satin Bower Bird, with his Donaldson's Touraco
third, the gap being filled by O. E. Dunmore's Jay-Thrush.
The remaining class for lutinos, hybrids, etc., was won by H. Douthwaite's hen
lutino Ringneck Parrakeet ; his Blue-winged X Turquoisine Parrakeet hybrid being
second.

Fowl Pest Regulations

<bodyText confidence="0.989286555555555" page_id="56311396"  page_num="39" year="" vol="">
The most recent order of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries concerning
the movement of live poultry is that dated 24th November, 1947. Poultry is defined as
45 Domestic fowls, turkeys, ducks, and geese ". This leaves some room for doubt
about the type of birds it refers to, as the word " Domestic " might refer to the ducks
and geese as well as to the fowls. The Ministry has clarified this point and--alas for
aviculturists--the word only applies to fowls, and wild ducks and geese are included
in the movement ban.
In accordance with this order, no poultry--as defined--may be moved from
a scheduled area to other parts of the country. The scheduled area includes : the
counties of Bedford, Berks, Buckingham, Cambridge, Derby, Essex, Hertford,
Huntingdon, Isle of Ely, Kent, Leicester, Lincoln (Parts of Holland), Lincoln (Parts
of Kesteven), Lincoln (Parts of Lindsey), London, Middlesex, Norfolk, Northampton,
Nottingham, Oxford, Rutland, Soke of Peterborough, Southampton, Stafford, East
Suffolk, West Suffolk, Surrey, East Sussex, West Sussex, Warwick, Worcester, and
the West Riding of Yorkshire.
There is, moreover, a complete ban on all movement of birds into Scotland and the
Scilly Isles.
However, birds may be moved freely in the rest of the country--that is in Wales
and in England west of a line running approximately from Yorkshire through
Worcestershire to Hampshire--and from this area into the scheduled area.
Swans are not specifically included and may legally be moved, but the Ministry
believes that they may carry the disease and asks that they be moved as little as
possible. The Ministry urges the fullest co-operation in these regulations so that the
disease may be controlled as soon as possible. There seems still just a chance that
the restrictions will be lifted in time for birds to be moved before next breeding season.
For reference the order is called No. 6899. Live Poultry (Regulation of Sales,
Exhibitions, and Movements) Order of 1947.

Breeding Stanley Parrakeets

In fairness to my friends at Keston, I think I should amplify my remarks on the
Stanley in the September-October number of Avicultural Magazine, 1947, p. 167.
The Duke of Bedford started breeding the Stanley shortly before the Great War,
and during the next nine or ten years carefully built up a considerable breeding
stock. When, in 1923, he decided to give up the regular breeding of this species,
he was able to write in Bird Motes , 1923, p. 97 :--
" There is now in Europe an unrelated stock of this pretty species, quite sufficient,
if properly managed , to render aviculturists independent of importation from Australia.
" I should like to emphasize the fact, however, that Stanley owners must take
a great deal more pains over the housing and mating of their stock than bird-keepers
have ever done in the past with any parrakeet, budgerigars alone excepted, if in a
few years' time Stanleys are not to become as scarce as Elegants and New Zealands.
. I have done my bit, and the future of the species in Europe now rests with
those who, at different times, have secured my young or imported stock."
Aviculturists evidently did not take this warning to heart, for within ten years
Keston found that Stanleys were quite unobtainable in this country, and they had

to import their breeding stock from Australia. From then on they bred numerous
Stanleys, and at the peak period just before the war, they were putting on the market
from thirty-five to forty-five aviary-bred young ones each year. Thus it will be seen
that the present numerical strength of this species is in the main due to Keston
initiative and perseverance.
Two other species they have concentrated on at Keston, the Mealy Rosella and
the Golden-mantled Rosella, also appear on the register in gratifying numbers.
Finally, all the Yellow Redrumps must be directly descended from Keston birds,
as the variety originated in their aviaries.

Additions to the London Zoo
October, 1947. The registered additions for the month numbered sixty-seven.
The most important were 2 Southern Resplendent Trogons ( Pharomachrus mocino
costaricensis) , a subspecies new to the Collection, received in exchange ; 1 Humming
Bird, Sp. inc., presented by the New York Zoological Society ; and 3 Indian Manyar
Weaver Birds ( Ploceus manyar striatus ), a subspecies new to the Collection, purchased.
Other interesting arrivals were 1 Western Melba Finch ( Pytilia melha citerior)

Park, was a Grey-breasted Helmet Guinea Fowl ( JVumida galeata).
November, 1947. There were twenty-three new arrivals during the month.
Outstanding were 4 Large Darwin's Finches ( Geospiza magnirostris ) from the
Galapagos Islands, a species new to the Collection, collected by David Lack. Members
interested in this group of Finches, rather dull-looking, but highly important from
the evolutionist's point, should read Lack's Darwin's Finches.

SPECIAL NUMBERS OF THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99482055" page_id="56311397"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
May I register a respectful protest against the constantly recurring method of
issuing special numbers of the Magazine devoted exclusively to one particular section
of birds ? It is obvious that if a member is not interested in the class of bird dealt
with in such a number the issue makes very little appeal to him. For instance, I find
that in the last eight years there have been no less than six numbers devoted exclusively
to Waterfowl, four to Parrots, two to Pheasants, one to Birds at Semi-Liberty, and
one to Softbills.
Only the latter number had much interest to me, and I should have been well
content had the articles in that one been spread over several issues.
Now it is proposed to publish a Bird of Prey issue, and it is admitted that few
aviculturists have kept specimens of this particular group of birds. I suggest that
at the outside only a few dozen members will be interested in such an issue--all the
other hundreds will lay it aside disappointed.
If we are not careful someone with a bird in his bonnet will want an Extinct Bird
number with articles about the Moa, Dodo, and other dead and gone feathered
inmates of our prehistoric fathers' aviaries ! Do, please, let us have issues of general
appeal and so sustain the interest of members in every number.
I pen the foregoing with every sympathy in your efforts to produce a Magazine
issue after issue, but isn't it easier to produce a general issue than a special one ?

By L. G. Webber
In the past decade or so quite a number of Australia's rare birds
(some thought to be almost extinct) have popped up in captivity.
To the aviculturist must go the sole credit for a good deal of our
knowledge of the habits of these species, and for the fact that, in some
cases, he has rehabilitated and increased their numbers, probably
saving them from passing entirely from our ken as living creatures.
Of these, the one which has caused more comment and excitement
than any other is the intriguing Ground Parrot (Pezoporus wallicus).
According to historical notes in various ornithological and avicultural
publications, this bird has been known for about 150 years, yet there
is no authentic record of it having been bred in captivity, in fact very
few have seen the inside of an aviary.
Cayley, in Australian Parrots , has little to say about it in captivity,
and records Peir of Campsie, N.S.W., as having had a pair for some
years, and this as far back as 1885 ; it is also mentioned as having
been exhibited at the Zoo, quoting Tavistock, and I take this to
mean the London Zoo, as well as a probable breeding record in
France a number of years ago.
There is also mention by Cayley of a living example at the time
of writing (1937) at the Royal Park Zoological Gardens near
Melbourne.
I was in Melbourne when this bird arrived and was horrified to
see such a rare creature in such disgusting surroundings. At that
time a special section was reserved for Australian fauna and in a
delapidated old compartment, the floor riddled with holes of rodents,
looking more like a backyard fowl pen than an aviary, was this very
rare native Parrot resting on a log lying in one corner. Armed with
notebook and pencil I remained in the vicinity watching and waiting

for some hours, and with the falling light made my way back to
Melbourne with no more notes than the bird's name, and the fact that
it was motionless all the time under observation. This appears to
agree with Mr. Peir's observations on the behaviour of the birds in
his possession.
Since this time it was reported that the Adelaide Zoo had secured
some (?) specimens, and had also acquired the Melbourne bird.
It is to the generosity of a Sydney aviculturist, Mr. A. E. R. Leer,
who obtained a permit to keep these birds, that I am indebted for
the valuable data and photographs from which the bulk of these
notes were compiled.
The birds depicted were observed and captured by Mr. Leer and
were the first seen alive in Sydney for many years ; they attracted
visitors from as far afield as Adelaide, a mere 1,000 miles away.
A detailed description of the bird may be had on reference to
Cayley's Australian Parrots , but outstanding points will be mentioned,
and first of these concern sexing ; both male and female are similar in
colour, the latter being slightly larger, but this is not a reliable or
accurate method of determining sex. It is much simpler in the pre-
adult plumage stage when the young male is distinguished by a lighter
shade of green on the crown--it is in fact still visible in the adult stage,
but more difficult to detect.
The feet, although zygodactyle conforming to the normal Parrot,
have an unusual feature, fine sharp hooks are present on the underside
of each toe, in shape not unlike a crochet needle. The actual use of
these is not definitely known, but we could assume as an aid in running.
These birds are remarkably fast on foot.
In repose the Ground Parrot does not effect a normal parrot-like
stance, but always has the appearance of crouching, even when
moving about. However, when being pursued, it will repeatedly run
to the top of a tussock, stretch itself, and have a look-see, then off again.
If surprised at close range, the bird will " freeze ", drawing its
cheek feathers around its beak, obviously to complete its camouflage ;
once the observer moves his eye from the bird it will disappear as if
by magic.
From the apparent ease with which a dog can scent them, only
confirms earlier statements as to the bird having a strong odour, and
yet not once did the dog, an English Setter, locate a nest. Birds were
flushed and scents followed considerable distances, but always came
to an abrupt end ; on occasions the dog would circle round a radius
of some 50 to 60 feet. A thorough search sometimes revealed a nest
within this area, and observations proved that the bird, instead of
alighting, in a normal manner, " dropped like a stone," which would
tend to indicate that this was the method of approach to the nest,
thus breaking the scent.

L. G. WEBBER-GROUND PARROT IN HABITAT AND CAPTIVITY 43
Human approach to the nest can be made within 3 feet before the
hen will be flushed, and it was not unusual to see the bird fly a short
distance, land, and play the old established trick of affecting a broken
wing, fluttering around to distract attention away from the nest.
The eggs, usually three or four, are practically round in shape, pure
white without gloss.
The nests are not found in the swamps but on the high ground, the
birds observing a local seasonal migration from the winter feeding
grounds, leaving towards the end of July for the breeding season
nesting sites, sometimes in hilly country, where their more natural
food is to be found, a type of tussock grass. In the winter they feed on
the sorgham and cultivated millets grown for winter stock feed.
The birds feed early morning and late evening and are rarely, if
ever, seen unless flushed from their hideout.
The food appears to be always green, one bird caught in the net
disgorged half a cupful of green seed, but the unusual part of this was
that the crop was still so well packed that it extended past the body
line of the bird, giving it a very queer appearance.
They are practically silent, but the call note is heard more towards
the breeding season and then frequently at night, and on dull wet
days--this note is similar to the single call note of the Turquoisine
Parrakeet.
When the nesting site has been selected, usually inside a tussock of
grass, but has been found in a fallen hollow log, it takes up to four
days to prepare the nest by nipping the grass stalks off short. The
soil is well trampled down, the eggs being laid in this shallow depression.
After the eggs are hatched (twenty-one days, but not confirmed)
the perimeter of the nest is gradually built up by the excreta of the
nestlings, who normally all face towards the centre. Once again
nature does not fail these birds, the excreta is black, the soil is black,
so the position of the nest is not given away. The reason for the black
excreta is due to the young being fed exclusively on green food, and,
of course, the nestlings themselves are black, completing the cycle.
The Ground Parrots' natural enemies are more likely to be snakes,
as foxes and cats were not observed. However, as there are no rabbits
in the swamps or near vicinity, there is, therefore, no attraction for
the foxes or cats. Hawks might play some part in keeping the number
of birds down, and on one occasion by observing the antics of a hawk
it led to the discovery of a Ground Parrot.
Notes in Captivity
Cayley in his introduction to Australian Parrots says : " Recent
successes, both in Australia and abroad, in breeding in captivity
several species of the fast disappearing Neophema Parrakeets is proof
that it is possible, with scientific methods, to breed any of our rarer

Parrots. One hears the objection that birds bred under such circum-
stances would perish if liberated. No doubt. But what is the alterna-
tive ? Is it not far better to see these birds reproducing their kind
in captivity than allow them to become extinct. Unless a serious
attempt is made to save these few species now on the verge of extinc-
tion, only museum specimens will be left as witness of a fate that might
have been prevented.
In advocating the breeding of these birds in captivity, especially
the rarer species, I do so in the hope that such breedings will be
carried out under licence and in a purely scientific manner--not on
a commercial basis."
This would especially apply to the Ground Parrot, and instead of
these notes being the first to appear in print for some years (in fact
the last aviary notes were published in the Avicultural Magazine,
September-October, 1941) let us hope that they may be a forerunner
of further records of this bird in captivity. However, to be able to
do this we need in this State (N.S.W.) a much more sympathetic
government, one that would use some foresight to the future of our
rare birds, and allow the aviculturist to make a real attempt to get
on with the study and breeding of not only those considered on the
verge of extinction, but any or all of the " fully protected " species.
The Ground Parrots, strange as it may seem, show a preference for
sunflower seed and canary and millet seed in that order, yet they never
see a sunflower in their native state. Lucerne and thistle are the
popular green foods. It was almost a week before the adult birds
would feed off the ground, and unlike the normal Parrot never pick
food up with the feet and pass it to the bill.
A very uninteresting bird in the aviary remaining still all day,
becoming very active after sunset, feeding and bathing, climbing all
over the aviary wire, and night observations showed both birds bathing
at 11.30 p.m.
They were very fond of the sun, and whilst trying to find sufficient
cover, always took advantage of the sunniest spot.
Special observations during the approach of the breeding season
were disappointing, the cock spent quite some time climbing the
wire, apparently seeking an escape, and constantly calling the hen ;
she did not respond, and remained on her selected day roost.
The nestlings in the accompanying photo were three weeks old
when collected, and were completely disowned by the parents when
placed in the aviary ; this meant, of course, resort to hand feeding.
Their food mixture was rolled oats, a few drops of cod-liver oil,
crushed arrowroot biscuits moistened with milk. They were fed three
times a day, and on this diet thrived, gaining weight and strength.
After the first week the milk was deleted from the mixture as they
went a bit off colour, and it was assumed that the milk was to blame,

and boiling water was used to moisten the food. As soon as the food
cooled down the youngsters refused to take any more, and to prevent
this happening the food bowl was placed in a larger one containing
boiling water.
Green seed was added now to the diet, consisting of millet and native
seeding grasses.
At six weeks the birds were picking the food themselves, especially
the seeding grass, and at this stage were being placed on the lawn,
during the day, in a large portable chicken coop. They would bask
in the sun and having had enough of this would all go to one corner
and have a sleep.
Being hand fed they were extremely tame, and would show an
intelligent alertness when called by an imitation Ground Parrot call.
Two of them would, if placed on the lawn, fly down to the food pot
when called, a distance of about 6 feet.
The milk was again reintroduced in the diet and the birds then
refused to take any food at all--in three days they were all dead.
Although not visible in the photo the long nestling hair was still
evident, even though the normal plumage was showing on most of
the body and wings. Earlier, when the nestlings were just covered
with the down, the new feathers, a rich green and black, could be
seen by blowing the down.
Although not a story of success some valuable information was
gleaned from the four weeks the young were being hand reared, and
next time should be a different ending.

W. GRIFFITHS-THE BIRDMAN ARTISTE
THE BIRDMAN ARTISTE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.991834465116279" page_id="56311409"  page_num="46" year="" vol="">
By W. Griffiths, D.F.H.
A very common sight, indeed, on the streets of Calcutta, is to see
a birdman walking with a long bamboo balanced on his shoulder,
supporting on either side five or six wire cages packed with birds.
These birdmen invariably call at the homes of all keen aviculturists
and it is not long before they all seem to know anyone interested in
birds, since it is a case of one birdman giving the news to his pals.
And then the aviculturist sure has the time of his life picking and
choosing, bargaining, exchanging and sometimes ending up by selling
his own surplus stock to the birdman.
More often than not, these cages are filled with common avian life
such as Avadavats, Nutmeg Finches, Zosterops, Nuns, Java Sparrows,
Weavers, Sunbirds, and Silverbills, and are offered at first at a shilling
each, but are later given for about 2 d. each. When, however, they have
nothing rare to sell, they generally fill a cage with Silverbills, each bird
being painted by hand and with all the colours of the rainbow--enough
to make even the beautiful Gouldian Finch blush with shame. This, of
course, being an old trick, is well known to all aviculturists and even
to an inexperienced eye, beneath all this wonderful colouring, can
easily be detected the all too familiar and common Silverbill. Again,
besides this, the call note is so very easily recognized too, yet it is
surprising to see how many people, fooled by this camouflage, pay
terrific prices for these birds and these shrewd birdmen sure know
when they are dealing with 44 greenhorns ".
Just to make the artiste birdman a wee bit happy, I have often
pretended to show amazement at the sight of such beautiful and exotic
birds and on inquiring what they were, have been given such names
as 44 Gulabi " Munia (Gulabi meaning pink and Munia a name
generally given to small finches), Rose finch, 44 Belighty 55 Waxbill,
(Belighty means English), etc., and that these birds have come from
Australia, Africa or America, whichever place comes to their minds
first. Quite automatically then, the price is raised and you are informed
that he is letting you have them cheap for # 1 each. The bargaining then
starts and should he remain adamant, just pass a hint that the birds
look painted and with a countenance full of guilt he surrenders a pair
for the same price as an unpainted one.
One day I bought a pair of these painted Silverbills for my son who
was taken up with their bizarre colouring. He had them in a small
cage and they were getting on fine till a few days later he came to me
with tears in his eyes and sadly said, 44 Daddy, my birds are dead."
On accompanying him to discover the cause, I beheld both birds
lying at the bottom of the cage with just a few traces of colour still on
them but the drinking water all tinged. The poor birds had both

taken a bath and the colour being washed away poisoned the water
which they later drank.
Very often, however, the Indian birdman gets quite a lot of Austra-
lian Finches which are brought out by Chinese sailors for them, and
these are first taken to the aviculturist for sale before being taken to
the #c Hart "--small market place where all birdmen meet twice a week.
In this manner I have from time to time picked up some real bargains,
due to the pitiful condition of the birds and the superstitious practices
of the Indian birdman. I remember once purchasing five Painted
Finches (Emblema picta) at a shilling and sixpence each. There were
three males and two females in the lot. They were just taken off the
boat and were in a deplorable condition being only half-clothed. The
dealer got them at a shilling each and was satisfied with his small
profit as he was convinced they would not survive. Three did not live,
unfortunately both females died, but the two males that lived I had
for two years.
The superstitions, an Indian bird dealer has, are as follows :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.7171816" page_id="56311410"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
( a ) If he sells a man any bird or birds (his first sale) and later in the
day has many more sales, he considers his first buyer as lucky and will
always try to sell this buyer something or other, even at a loss, with the
hope that he will have good sales later in the day.
(b) To refuse any buyer a sale first thing in the morning is con-

sidered unlucky as he will then have a bad day of sales.
These superstitions also being known to fanciers, they all try to be
the first, of a morning, in the bazaar and although one is very often
unlucky, there is great fun in it. I have been refused a pair of Pic-
torellas for #i during the day but have got the same pair for 15^.
merely by being the first on the scene on a different day. I got a pair
of Crimson Finches the very same way.
Before concluding I thought I would mention another little trick
which really proves the artistic ability of the Indian birdman. Down
the main streets of Calcutta, the American, who during the war
was always to be found, was the one who generally suffered under
the ruse.
Birdmen would be seen with two or three Rose-ringed Parrakeets
perching on their fingers or shoulders. The tails of these birds, each
feather done separately, were turned and twisted into various fantastic
patterns. Some were curled upwards, others fanned out like a per-
forming peacock's tail, some like the Lyre-bird, etc. They really did
look grand and being finger tame were bought up like hot cakes and
fetched real high prices. But were they finger tame ! The poor
birds were doped, but when the effects wore off these Parrakeets were to
be seen " taking off" with their well-known piercing call note, kee-ak,
kee-ak, kee-ak, much to the amusement of the passers-by as they
watched the surprised countenance of the duped one.

THE RED MOUNTAIN DOVE
Geotrygon montana

It is a pity that Pigeons and Doves are not more popular aviary
birds, as they are almost invariably harmless to other birds however
small, unless those birds also be Doves. Their lack of popularity is,
I think, largely due to their two faults, nervousness and a lethargic
disposition. Personally I like, second only to waterfowl, the Doves
and Pigeons, whether they be wild species or the many domestic
variations of the Rockdove.
One of the species kept here is the Red Mountain Dove (Geotrygon
montana). The Ground Dove families to which this Dove belongs are
the most desirable of the Dove groups, as they are active birds, and
very rarely indulge in the battering panics of the more arboreal
species. In the Red Mountain Dove the sexes are most conveniently
dissimilar. The cock is a warm cinnamon brown above ; face,
throat, breast, and underparts pinkish-white, with a brown streak
running from the beak through the eye. The hen's pattern is the
same, only the cinnamon is replaced with olive-brown and the pinkish-
white with dirty grey-white.
They spend most of the daytime marching about the floor with a
curious bobbing stern action, so common amongst the waders, and
stop suddenly to pick up some seed or insect. They are much more
omnivorous than most Doves, being fond of slugs, worms, fruits, etc.
Early in the year the cocks start cooing, and appear to have four
different types of coo. Firstly, when under no particularly strong
emotional impulse the cocks sit on some bough uttering a fairly high
pitched sad coo repeated almost indefinitely at about ten second
intervals. The hens only very occasionally call in this way, and then
in a weaker voice. Secondly, when at the chosen nesting site the
cock birds, and quite often the hens, will crouch with twitching
wings uttering at intervals a curious double coo. This begins with
a short throaty coo, the wings are then raised fully stretched above
the back, lowered expanded in a very slow flap and shut, the bird
then giving the normal sad coo. This coo-flap-coo is repeated at
about twenty-second intervals. This call generally seems to be used
when one of the pair wants to summon its mate. Very often when
nest building if the foraging member of the pair is away long, the
bird on the site uses this call. I have also noticed that if when sitting,
a bird uses this call it is pretty soon relieved by its mate. On several
occasions when the sitting hen has been using this call, the cock has
answered her several times with a softer version of his No. i call before
flying up to relieve her. The third call is a series of short sharp

cu-cu-cus and used as an alarm call, the caller generally being chased
by its mate or by a rival. The fourth call is used invariably after
pairing, and very occasionally when displaying. In the latter instance
the cock flies down to his mate, using exaggerated clapping wing
beats rather as a farmyard cock descends from a wall to his hens ;
on landing with a bump a little in front of the hen, he bows to her
once, beak to the ground and short tail fanned out on high, giving
a single rather low coo. This action is rather similar to the display
of the wood pigeon, except that the bow is only made the once.
This display always occurs when the cock j'umps from the hen's back
after coition.
We have two pairs of these Doves, both of which reared young
in 1946. One pair shared an aviary with a pair of Princess of Wales
Parrakeets. These Parrakeets have a mouse-proof stand on which their
food dishes are placed. It was upon this flat table top that I noticed
the hen Dove squatting quietly with twitching wings. In a minute
or so the cock flew up with a twig. He landed on her back, placed
the twig beside her breast, and went off to find another. The hen,
shuffling round in an endeavour to form a hollow on the table top,
knocked the twig over the edge. The cock marching around the floor
eventually found the twig, and after testing it once or twice, offered it
again to the hen. If one were to look in on the birds an hour or so
later, the nest would obviously consist of one twig or nothing. I filled
a little punnet with hay and put it on the table where the Dove wanted
to build. She squatted as before on the table, completely ignoring
my delightful nest. She obviously was determined to lay on the table
top and let her eggs be swept to the floor. I gathered a bucketful
of flints and completely covered the table top with them. (The
Parrakeets had been given another table.) Even the most pig-headed
of Doves must realize that if she wanted to sit down on the table top
without spiking herself she must sit in the punnet, and sit in the
punnet she did. We left the birds severely alone at first. I was
therefore somewhat surprised at the end of a fortnight to hear squeaks
and to see the cock bird feeding youngsters of several days old. From
subsequent nestings I discovered that the incubation is about ten
days, and that the eggs are quite brown, rather the colour of a hen's
brown egg.
We supplied the old birds with a little dry biscuit-meal, a few
peanuts, maple peas, and plenty of live food. When eating earth-
worms, the Doves picked them up and beat them against the ground
in exactly the same manner as does a Blackbird or Robin before they
were swallowed. They were also very fond of the slimy whitish fawn
slugs, and small snails. Gentles and blow fly chrysalis, especially the
latter, were greedily eaten. Both sexes were model sitters and parents ;
the cock birds relieve the hens between eight and half-past in the

morning, a couple of hours earlier than most male Pigeons consider
necessary. One morning when I went in both the cock and the hen
were sitting in the punnet. I happened to come back considerably
later, and both birds were sitting as I had left them, their dishes of
food and live bait untouched. Something was evidently amiss, so I
went up to the stand and discovered that the youngsters had got
separated and that each parent was brooding a baby, so neither was
free to relieve the other. I gently picked up the hen and put her on
the floor. Much to my surprise she began to play the broken wing
trick, fluttering and tumbling about the floor. I picked her baby up
and quickly slipped him alongside his brother under his father's
breast. This broken wing display interested me, as it was apparently
an automatic reaction to a disturbance at the nest, and had not
necessarily anything to do with fear. If in subsequent nests I dis-
turbed the hen while on the nest, she would invariably go through
her display quite often coming fluttering and tumbling across the
floor to take titbits from my hand.
The youngsters, both cocks, left the nest at about a fortnight old.
They seemed very immature, and sat fluffed out on the floor except
when being fed by their attentive parents, but at night they managed
to roost well off the ground. Their plumage was very dark brown,
broadly tipped with cinnamon, the general effect in the distance was
of a darker edition of their father.

Finfoots have not often, if ever, been imported, and consequently
little seems to be known of them at close quarters. Perhaps a few
remarks upon one which I had when I went to the Gold Coast in
1946 for the Zoological Society of London as a guest of Mr. G. S.
Gansdale, G.M.Z.S., may be of interest. The Senegal Finfoot is
about the size of the smaller Sun-Bittern [Eurypyga helias), and is very
like that bird in the head and neck, although the latter is not so
long. It is also a heavier and more powerful bird. The upper parts
are a darkish brown and are covered with round cream-coloured
spots. The lower parts, light with a rosy flush. Legs orange-red and
lobed like a Coot. Tail, rather long and stiff. The bird has a Duck-
like stance, squat with short legs set wide apart.
A native brought this one in, and I housed it in a cage with dried
grass and a large water pot. It was necessary to hand feed it at first,

like many freshly caught birds which do not recognize artificial
food as food at all and will otherwise starve in the midst of plenty.
It had been brought from a distance, and we had none of its natural
food available, i.e. small marsh and water life. Grasshoppers were
plentiful but not easy to catch in quantity, and the other small birds
needed those we did get. My attempt at breeding gentles was not
successful, owing to the humidity keeping the sand wet, so that it
was more like mud. The gentles, consequently, did not clean them-
selves and being wet enabled them to escape up the sides of their
tin. A visitation of Driver Ants put an end to the experiment. I fed
the Finfoot at first on minced raw meat, wetted and dipped in fish
meal. He took it more readily wetted and also minus the fish meal,
but previous experience had taught me the risk of raw meat for
smaller birds without roughage of some kind, as a regular diet. It
was while holding him as I had to at first, that I found he had a
peculiar habit of inflating his body, the intake causing a growling
noise. This intake was very powerful, pushing one's hand open, and
it was almost impossible to hold him, except against oneself. It
seemed as if it would go on until he burst, but then he would suddenly
collapse with a hiss. This was immediately followed by a struggle
and vicious pecks. This habit must be very useful, as I all but let
him escape, especially before I was accustomed to it. The growling
and swelling was quite startling, and made the bird seem ominous
and snake-like, especially as he used to look one straight in the eye
and follow movement with his beak ready to dart. This last was an
efficient implement, and he used to draw blood half a dozen times
whenever I opened the door to take him out or feed him, but as he got
used to me I would only get a half-hearted peck with no power
behind it. He would eat a small bird, as I found out when I gave
him a young Bronze-winged Mannikin which had died. At first, he
would wash his meat like a Sun Bittern does, but not invariably, and
ceased doing this usually after he had the mixture. This mixture was
the universal food for insectivorous birds, made from all that was
obtainable, i.e. minced raw meat (often goat and all not used put in
the refrigerator at once before it turned), fish, and meat meals--taken
out by me, ground biscuits, a very little hard-boiled egg--(maximum
supplies, four per day) and ground peanuts. These last, being fresh,
were of course, full of oil, almost enough to flow when minced, and
very different to the ones we get over here. He ate this mixture
with avidity, settled down, and was quite happy and quiet.
Another peculiar habit was turning round and round as a dog does
when about to lie down so many times that he got the grass twisted
round his tail in a hard rope. It was impossible to pull it off without
pulling out his tail feathers, so I had to hold him and untwist the rope
until it would slip off. I got quite fond of him and never doubted that I

would get him here, but he died suddenly two days out from Liverpool.
I was a month travelling with the collection as I left Oda in a special
railway-van for Takoradi. The boat was delayed and did not arrive for
a week, so I and the collection spent a week on a siding in the full rays
of the sun. The hold was covered over and was dark except for a few
lights which I fixed up myself. With this and the reek of the hides
and palm oil, I think the journey was just two or three days too long
for him. If it had not been for the week's hold up at Takoradi, I am
sure he would have got here and thrived. He was in perfect condition,
and I gave his body to the cook to put on ice. He gave him to me
when he went ashore at Liverpool, but unfortunately in the rush of
unshipping the collection I forgot him and left him lying on a hatch.
In conclusion, perhaps Finfoots are outside the scope of aviculturists,
but one never knows, one or two may arrive. I feel sure from my
experience that they will thrive, given the same treatment as small
Waders, especially in a marshy aviary in the summer, although I should
not be inclined to trust them with small Finches if they came within
range.

General description of adult from green, red flight feathers, blackish-
blue tail and over wings, crest ditto, red skin round eye with a white
spot over eye and a white line running along under the eye, bill
blackish horn, feet and legs black.
It might, I thought, possibly interest some of the readers of the
Avicultural Magazine to hear of hand rearing the above bird.
They are very common in the Thompson Falls district, about 50 miles
from where I live. I also have them in the garden here but have never
found a nest locally. Most of the nests now (24th September, 1947)
contain young birds. The young are perfectly hideous little things, and
covered with black fluff with huge 44 gapes " of a pale pink colour, bill
lightish horn colour. The young ones I am rearing are about as big as
newly hatched chickens. I was very relieved to find that they 44 gape "
for food and are not fed like the pigeon family, i.e. on 44 milk " from the
crop. They eat an enormous amount of food, which being paste very
quickly goes through them. I feed them every half-hour--which is a
tie but well worth the trouble. Their food consists of ripe banana or
Paw-Paw 1 . I think probably sweet potato will be added to their diet
as they grow older. Even at this young 44 down " stage they preen

their fluff continually. One has to wash the beaks with warm water
after every meal to keep them from getting sticky. My greatest diffi-
culty is keeping them warm. I think they require a very high tempera-
ture until they are feathered--more so than most birds I have hand
reared. They are kept in a box, lined thickly with cotton wool and over
this I put a linen handkerchief, which is renewed every time I feed them.
If they are taken out of the cotton wool nest and placed on a piece of
paper they relieve themselves at once ; directly they do this I feed
them and they are no more trouble. One revolting trick they have is
to swallow the food, and, if frightened suddenly sick the whole thing
up---in fact both ends want continual watching while you handle them !
I imagine I could now take a place as a 65 monthly nurse 55 at any
time ! The birds are fed from daybreak until about 7.30 p.m.
continually every half-hour and so far seem to be doing well. The nests
of the Turaco (at least the four or five I have seen) are about 8 to 15 feet
from the ground mostly in wild coffee trees, at the extreme end of the
branches and well hidden by foliage. The nest is not unlike a Pigeon's
but much better made and more cup-shaped. Eggs dull white and
rather like a Pigeon's-- never more than two eggs.

I have successfully reared a pair of these lately and they can now
fly and feed themselves but refuse to leave the cage. They are dull
birds as yet, as they are in immature plumage. I fed them about every
hour or hour and a half on bread, which I " chewed " first, and also
half-ripe maize--which at this stage is very sweet, tender, and milky,
an ideal food to rear young Pigeons and Doves on. They are now fed
on millet and biscuit crumbs but almost entirely live on the biscuit
crumbs, which they much prefer to any of the various grain I have tried
them with. What I take to be the cock has a far longer tail than the
hen, quite half an inch longer ; he is also of a lighter grey colour and
his eye (sherry-coloured with dark pupil) is much lighter than that of
the hen. They are, in my opinion, handsome birds when in full adult
plumage--they are great drinkers, like all the Pigeons and also sun-
bathe a good deal, lying on their sides at the bottom of their cage. They
are both ridiculously tame but have bad fits of " night fright "--for
no reason as far as I can make out. They sleep in my room at night
as the Searfu ants are so bad here, that, if I were not in the room to
move the cage when the ants get on the march, they would kill them
at once--as indeed they would kill any living thing that could not
get away from them. I hope eventually both the Doves and the
Turacos will find their way to England this year.
Since writing this I have found the best food to rear young Turacos
on is boiled potato " chewed up " and fed to them while it is warm !
Filthy, but it answers o.k.!

There can be very few people interested in birds and who were
regular or occasional visitors to the gardens of the Zoological Society
of London who have not been acquainted with James Bailey. He
first saw the light of day at a hill farm on the Wiltshire Downs on
gth March, 1886, and came to the Zoo as a helper in 1905, when he
was 19 years old. In 1909 he was promoted to Junior Keeper and
in 1912 to Senior Keeper, when he became Head Keeper of the
Small Bird House.
He served with distinction during the 1914-18 War for four years,
where incidentally he collected souvenirs in the form of bullet and
shrapnel wounds. On his return to the Zoo, in February, 1919, he
went back to his former occupation, and in 1923 was made Overseer
of the whole bird section.
Whilst with the Society he served under three secretaries, viz.
Sir P. Chalmers Mitchell, Professor Julian Huxley, and Dr. Sheffield
A. Neave, and under the superintendence or curatorships of Mr. R. I.
Pocock, Mr. David Seth-Smith, and Dr. G. M. Vevers.
Many notable breeding successes occurred during this period,
many of which have been recorded by Mr. Seth-Smith. Mr. Bailey
retired on a pension in December, 1947, after 42 years' service.
During the attacks by air on London in the recent war he was a
warden in the Society's A.R.P. and was one of the few wardens
permitted to carry firearms. Quite a few exciting nights were
experienced in the area of the Zoo, as most people know.
In the opinion of Dr. Vevers it would be difficult to find anyone
in this country with more experience in the identification, keeping,
and breeding of birds of all descriptions in captivity. His knowledge
of the feeding and habits of birds under avicultural conditions is
quite unsurpassed.
Many members of the Avicultural Society have good cause to be
grateful to Mr. Bailey, for he never failed to give advice and to place
his knowledge and experience at their disposal.
Those who know him admire his equanimity, philosophical outlook,
and ready sense of humour.
The position of Overseer which he held has now been ably filled
by Mr. Edward Tanner, who has been Head Keeper of the Small
Bird House at the Zoo for many years.

As I have only quite recently been elected a member of the
Avicultural Society perhaps it is natural that I should submit this
short article with some diffidence. Nevertheless, as I have kept both
British and foreign birds intermittently for nearly forty years, the
present account of the 1947 breeding of Song Thrushes in my garden
aviary may not be without interest to at least some of our readers.
During the recent conflict with Germany I was compelled to part
with practically all my foreign birds because of the impossibility of
obtaining sufficient millet at a reasonable price. The only birds
I retained were an Orange-headed Ground Thrush, a Pekin Robin
(one of my own breeding), an Australian Crested Pigeon, and a
superannuated Waxwing. All these, except the Pekin Robin, were
very old birds indeed and have since passed away. The Pekin Robin,
however, happily remains.
Towards the end of March, 1947, I decided to bring in a mixed
collection of about fifty British seed-eaters and softbills, among which
were a pair of Tree Pipits, a cock Blackbird, and three Song Thrushes
(two cocks and a hen). Within four days of introducing the Thrushes,
which, by the way, had been confined by the dealer in cages, the two
cocks commenced to sing, one at each end of a 50 ft. flight. It was
apparently a contest, so fervent and sustained were their varied notes.
Every morning and evening, and not infrequently at intervals through-
out the day, these two artists flung their music at each other with
commendable defiance. Then one morning I noticed that the water
in one of the fountains was very dirty and on the edges were patches
of mud and bits of wet fibre. Having replenished the water I watched
for developments. Presently one of the Thrushes with a tuft of dried
grass and earth in its beak hopped on to the edge of the fountain and
dipped the stuff in the water several times until it was thoroughly
saturated. The bird then flew off into a smooth-leaved holly (one of
several planted down the middle of the flight), and although I was
unable to locate the building site it was evident that operations had
been under way for some time. It may be mentioned that as the
flight is planted with various trees and shrubs and the surrounding earth
overgrown by grass and weeds, no special material was supplied to
the birds for nesting purposes. A noticeable effect of the constructional
process was a dark mark on the feathers of one of the birds where the
breast came in contact with the mud when moulding the inside of
the nest.
About a week afterwards, although I still could not see the nest

itself owing to the thick foliage, I did see the bird in a sitting position.
When the eggs were hatched I realized that with the competition for
live food from Yellow-hammers, Reed Buntings, Chaffinches, Tree
Pipits, and other semi-insectivorous birds it would be necessary to
provide earthworms and gentles exclusively and in abundance for
the young Thrushes. The parent birds, indeed, soon reminded me of
my responsibilities, for whenever I appeared with the maggot tin
they flew to my feet and virtually demanded immediate attention.
I was astonished at the facility with which the grubs were picked up
by the old birds from the aviary floor. As many as a dozen maggots
at a time were gathered in the beak and flown outside to the nest.
As time progressed I was able by the aid of binoculars to identify
four youngsters being fed, and from that time until they were eating
independently maggots were supplied in ever-increasing quantities.
How many of these grubs were consumed by these four young Thrushes
during their period of rearing to independence it is beyond me to
compute, but the quantity was far greater that I should have supposed
desirable or even possible. In addition, a gardener whom I know
undertook to collect as many earthworms as possible from the various
gardens upon which he was employed, and with this supplementary
fare coming in regularly the young Thrushes grew apace. No soft
food or fruit of any kind was ever taken out to the nestlings so far
as I could discover. They were reared entirely on worms and gentles
and such miscellaneous flies and grubs as could be procured naturally
in the flight. In the earlier stages, however, it was necessary to offer
very small maggots every three or four hours during the day.
The only external difference between the young birds and their
parents was that the former were speckled on their backs, but these
spots gradually disappeared as the young ones grew towards maturity.
They are now about five months old, and whilst I imagine that a
certain amount of scolding and chasing of one another in and out of
the trees and bushes is merely play, I have observed a tendency to
quarrelling not only among themselves but between individual
youngsters and their parents. In such a spacious and densely planted
flight, however, I do not anticipate serious results, but during the
coming spring it may be found advisable to separate them.

BIRD-LIFE ON MALTA

To anyone arriving from Egypt, with its teeming ubiquitous bird-
life, Malta is apt at first sight to appear rather lacking in bird-life
unless adverse weather conditions have resulted in a concentration
of held-up migrants. More detailed observations, however, will
soon show that although the number of species that breed on the
island is few, those few are numerous and widely distributed, many
others spend the winter there, and there is an almost continuous
passage of trans-Mediterranean migrants, which reaches its peak
from March till early June and then again from September to Decem-
ber and is at its lowest in July and August when only a few odd birds
are seen. The reason for the apparent scarcity is the timidity that
most species show owing to persecution. Birds of nearly all species
are shot for food. On Sunday mornings in spring and autumn there
will be gunners all over the island, in every stone cairn, under
every clump of carob trees, among the rocks on the shore, waiting
to fire at any bird--from a Wheatear to a Purple Heron--that should
approach within range. In winter the bird-trappers wait patiently
for hours, until the call-birds, in their tiny prisons have drawn the
attention of a flock of their kind, and the latter attracted by the
fluttering of a Linnet or Greenfinch tied by its legs to a stick which
is manipulated by the hidden watcher, have discovered the food
spread between the nets. A large percentage of these unfortunate
birds die within a week of capture. They are perhaps the lucky
ones, since most of those that survive are doomed to drag out their
lives in wretchedly small and incredibly filthy cages ; although the
Wagtails, after their wings have been clipped, are often allowed the
freedom of the house in order that they may serve as animated and
ornamental fly-traps.
Of the birds that breed on the island the commonest and most
self-evident is the Maltese Sparrow. His strident chirp is heard from
every tree and building, his untidy nest fills every hole and crevice
about the houses, and large colonies also breed in many of the coastal
cliffs. It would be interesting to know if this latter habit is the result
of a search for " lebensraum " by an ever-multiplying species or the
original habitat of the bird before it attached itself to mankind.
This bird is a sub-species of the Spanish Sparrow, it is said to
differ from the typical form in being only slightly streaked on the
flanks. But this feature is extremely variable and one may often see
in adjacent holes one cock bird almost, if not quite, as heavily marked
on the flanks as the typical form, and another showing no striations
at all. The hen birds much resemble a darkish hen House Sparrow

in plumage, and after the autumn moult the cock differs little from
a cock House Sparrow, but in the breeding, plumage which is
apparently acquired by abrasion, his chestnut red cap, pale cheeks,
and larger black breast patch at once distinguish him.
The Sparrow seems to enjoy the same sort of affectionate regard in
Malta as the Robin in England. I have never seen it killed or used
for food, although it is sometimes kept as a cage-bird. In the country
districts almost every house has the walls festooned with earthenware
jars and the roof bordered with stone nest-boxes for the Sparrow's
benefit, and his Maltese name signifies bird of the roof or homestead.
In general his habits are those of the House Sparrow, including
the rather peculiar one of several cock birds mobbing a single hen who
vigorously defends herself as they attempt to peck her ventral regions--
a procedure sometimes initiated by the display (?) in which a single
cock bird, chirping excitedly with raised tail and lowered wings,
hops around a hen bird who attacks him whenever he approaches
closely. Although also a town scavenger the Maltese Sparrow feeds
very largely on insects in the fields, and in consequence is probably
rather beneficial to the farmer than otherwise, unlike his relatives
elsewhere.
In November and December, 1943, a pair of these birds occupied
a cavity in the wall opposite my window in Sliema. During this
period there was little evidence of sexual activity, but the hen, and
to a lesser extent the cock also, were continually carrying pigeons'
feathers into the nest, behaviour reminiscent of the Egyptian Kite
which commences building in October, although it does not normally
lay until the latter part of January.
The Sardinian Warbler is common and well distributed, his habit of
frequently flying up on to some wire or bush-top to look around after
the manner of a Whitethroat (a bird he much resembles in most
respects), and his harsh scolding alarm notes make it impossible to
overlook him. He does not appear to be often shot or trapped, although
children hunt him through the bushes with sticks and stones and his
young are often taken to be reared as pets, which since the people
so doing have usually no idea of the needs of insectivorous birds, is
tantamount to a death sentence in most cases.
This bird is to be seen wherever there is a reasonable amount of
cover, even in small town gardens. All the nests I found were placed
low down in some bush or shrub and were cup-shaped structures of
dry grass and similiar materials lined with vegetable down.
I saw no hen Sardinian Warblers between mid-November, 1943, and
the 13th January, 1944, although cock birds were very much in
evidence, singing and indulging in the display flight in which the bird,
uttering a sibilant warble, flies in a peculiarly deliberate style with the
wings beating slowly in a manner rather similar to the display flight,

of the Greenfinch. It seems likely that the hen birds migrate in winter
but that the cocks remain in their territories, but as the bird is so
common in Southern Europe and a regular trans-Mediterranean
migrant extensive ringing and checking up of individual birds would
be necessary to establish the exact status of the Maltese specimens.
The Spectacled Warbler is a miniature Sardinian Warbler in shape
and markings, the cock having a blue-grey head and generally warm
brown body plumage with white throat and delicate salmon-fawn
tint on underparts and flanks instead of the black head and bluish
grey plumage of the larger bird. The hen much resembles the hen
Sardinian, but is of a much paler and less greyish brown. This bird
probably owes its name to the same ornithological genius who named
the Red-rumped Ghat and Spotted Flycatcher, for it would need
a rather vivid imagination to see the resemblance between spectacles
and the bare pinkish skin around its eyes, which is indeed not nearly
so conspicuous a feature in this bird as in the Sardinian.
The Spectacled Warbler is even more widely distributed than its
relative. Even a clump of thistles or the smallest shrub will serve it
for shelter and nesting-site and it is found in the most barren and
rocky places, although less common in town gardens than the larger
bird. The nest is a smaller edition of the Sardinian and the birds'
habits appear similar, although cock Spectacleds always seemed to
be far more abundant than the hens, perhaps because the latter are
more retiring, in which case they differ in this respect from the hen
Sardinian who is as ubiquitious and self-assertive as her mate in
spite of her dowdier plumage.
The Corn Bunting is very abundant in the more open parts of the
island, and is apparently a summer migrant, arriving in February
and leaving in September or October. During his stay on the island
the cock bird spends most of his time sitting hunched-up with tail
adroop on the top of a fig tree, or where modern civilization has
penetrated a barbed-wire entanglement, reiterating his monotonous
jingling song and letting his wife or wives " get cracking " on domestic
duties.
The Short-toed Lark arrives early in April. The first intimation
one usually has of this event if one is living in a town is the fact that
this species has suddenly replaced the Skylark as the most abundant
species in the bird-dealers' cages. When one goes into the countryside
the bird himself is to be seen on the wing over every field and patch
of waste land, uttering his song, which to my ears always seems
remarkably similar to that of the Chaffinch. This bird by the way is
constantly confused with the Skylark by most English people on the
island, the latter bird, which is one of the most numerous winter
migrants, appearing in spite of its numbers, to pass unrecognized
owing to its not singing whilst in Malta.

The Blue Rock-Thrush is present throughout the year, although
whether the breeding birds are resident is a point that only ringing
and recording will elucidate. It is common about all the coastal
cliffs and in many of the rocky valleys inland, and in winter is often
seen in more open country about houses and farmsteads.
This lovely bird rivals its more soberly garbed relatives as a songster,
many of its notes and phrases much resembling those of the Blackbird,
which indeed it resembles in many ways except as regards its choice
of habitat. Some of my happiest memories of Malta are of hours
spent sitting on a certain grassy slope, looking across the blue water
to the sister isle ofGozo and listening to the Blue Rock-Thrushes as they
flew out of the cliffs above to glide down on outspread wings and alight,
still singing, among the tumbled boulders at the sea-edge far below.
At various times I located several nests, but none were reachable.
I was informed by R.S.M. Routledge, who had lived some years on
the island, that he had once found a nest low down in a stone archway
and that both nest and eggs resembled those of the Blackbird.
The Blue Rock-Thrush (at least in Malta and Eastern Libya) is
extremely wary and takes good care to keep a discreet distance from
mankind. Presumably it is not easy to trap as I never saw one in
captivity. I take it this is the " Bluebird 55 of Oliver Goldsmith's
Animated Nature , of which he says that : " It is so docile and observes
everything with such diligence that though waked at midnight by
any member of the family it will at once commence to speak or whistle
at the word of command." Truly an accommodating pet !
Jackdaws I only saw twice--once a pair and once a small flock of
about fifteen. I was told that before the possession of shotguns became
general they were common, but that now only a few survivors breed
on the tiny isle of Commino. Since this islet is now inhabited it seems
unlikely that they will be able to survive much longer even in this last
outpost.
The Palm Dove, I think the Egyptian race breeds in St. Anton
Gardens, where I imagine it must have been artificially introduced.
Only on a very few occasions have I seen odd individuals elsewhere
on the island, no doubt all such wanderers are shot or trapped before
they have been long away from their sanctuary.
Odd pairs of Yellow-legged Herring Gulls are to be seen at all
seasons of the year about the coast, but I never saw any signs of nesting.
I think the fundamental reason for this failure to breed is being so
conspicuous and slow-flying that the birds are usually shot if they loiter
about any particular cliff-top, as they do in March and April. In
view of recently published investigations on the British Herring Gull,
however, it seems possible that lack of sufficient numbers to stimulate
the birds to breeding pitch might be a contributory factor as far as the
individual pairs are concerned.

In winter, or rather from mid-autumn till the middle of April,
many familiar " English " birds are present. Flocks of Linnets, Serins,
Greenfinches, Chaffinches, and Goldfinches rove about the island,
and all too many succumb to the lure of the innocent traitors in the
little wire cages and are taken in the clap-nets. The Linnets and
Serins indulge in a good deal of desultory warbling song, especially
on warm afternoons, when, fed and rested, the flocks are sunning
themselves in some peach or almond tree. The Song-Thrush forages
along the bottom of the stone walls, in damp valleys, and in the
gloom beneath the dark carob trees, alert and apprehensive, ever
ready to flee at the sight of his enemy man. So wild and shy is this
bird on Malta that I have spoken to many people who knew the bird
well at home, and yet could hardly be convinced that it was to be
found on Malta at all, far less that it was in fact extremely abundant.
Flocks of Skylarks and Starlings feed in the fields. Grey Wagtails
haunt the ephemeral streams that in winter flow along the beds of
the many narrow valleys, and the ill-named White Wagtail is to be
seen in most of the public gardens, as well as in more open country,
associating in pairs during the day and roosting communally at night
as it does in Egypt. Stonechats are also common during the winter.
They associate in pairs and appear to hold joint territories. At all
events when they first arrive there is a great deal of excited sparring,
chasing, and calling which soon abates, leaving in most cases a cock
and hen occupying territory which they share without dispute, and
so far as I could observe without any display of affection or even
interest towards one another. In the winter of 1943-4 hen Black
Redstarts were extremely common throughout the island, but I only
saw one cock bird during this period--a fine specimen who haunted
a small ruined garden and adjacent buildings in the heart ofValletta.
The Meadow-Pipit and the Robin are also abundant at this season.
The latter bird is not as a rule so unsuspicious towards human beings
as his English prototype, but he behaves similarly in other respects,
haunting gardens, orchards, and deep valleys where he stakes
out a territory and sings defiance at his neighbours. His tender
plaintive melody is the only bird-song of quality to be heard on Malta
except for that of the Blue Rock-Thrush, and it is a happy coincidence
that it is to be heard at the time of year when the latter bird is silent.
On the 15th November, 1944, two Goldcrests appeared in a large
conifer growing in a small garden near our billet in Sliema. They
continued to be seen almost daily in the same tree until early in
January, when I was moved to Valletta. A Chiff-Chaff was also in
the habit of frequenting the same tree. This little warbler is not
uncommon in winter, and as with most of the species above mentioned
its numbers are swelled by passage migrants in spring and autumn.

and Egypt, so will refrain from allowing a dull article to degenerate into
a dull catalogue by enumerating the species to be seen on passage in
Malta. Suffice to say they comprise most of our summer visitors to
Britain, and a good many that we seldom see, such as the Hoopoe,
Purple Heron, Lesser Kestrel, and Little Egret--all of which are
abundant. No article on Maltese birds would, however, be complete
without fuller mention of one passage migrant--the Turtle Dove.
This bird is present in large numbers from mid-April till mid-June
(although its numbers fluctuate daily as with other migrants), and
being not only highly edible but also very beautiful and disinclined to
die even under the most adverse conditions, it is a prime favourite
both for the cage and the kitchen. The Dove that halts on Malta
for rest and food finds no rest for the sole of her foot, but an ack-ack
barrage from every clump of carob trees and clap-nets in every field.
Some, of course, escape every hazard and continue on their way, but
all too many within a few hours of arriving on the island are stuffed
dead or dying into the string game-bags of the shooters or trundled
round the streets on a hawker's barrow, their delicate plumage torn
and blood-stained from rough handling. The Turtle Doves appear
not to alight on Malta during the return migration in autumn. I have
seen a few flying over fairly high in September, but never saw one in
the fields or along the cliffs, nor are fresh-caught specimens on sale
after the end of June.

About a year ago the Avicultural Society established a Registry
of the waterfowl remaining in the various collections in this country.
Its object was to take stock of the Swans, Geese, and Ducks which had
survived the war years, and to arrange exchanges for breeding purposes.
As a result, a number of species were kept going in this country which
would, but for the Registry, almost certainly have died out.
This scneme has proved sufficiently useful, we feel, to be continued
as an annual service to those who are interested in keeping ornamental
waterfowl.
The Waterfowl Registry embarks, therefore, upon its second season.
Because of the great shortage of birds which inevitably followed the
war, we were unable to make arrangements last year for many of
those who co-operated so handsomely when the scheme was first
launched. This was just as disappointing for us as for those whom
we could not help. The last breeding season, however, was fairly

successful and a small number of waterfowl were available for exchange
and for sale by last autumn. The conservation of these stocks is now
as important as ever for two reasons : first, because food supplies are
still so short that plans for expanding waterfowl collections cannot
yet be extensively undertaken except by zoos and similar bodies, and
secondly because the recent outbreak of " fowlpest " in this country
has severely limited the import of waterfowl from abroad and the
movements of birds within this country. It is hoped that the restric-
tions now in force will not last very long. Meanwhile we must try to
keep up the breeding stocks of our rarer species and be careful not to
allow any which are now firmly established to become rare.
Once more the circular letter and printed form, listing all the species
known to be in captivity, has brought an excellent response from
aviculturists all over the country. It appears that waterfowl are kept
by at least 75 people or institutions. The total number of birds is not
less than 2,403, including some 98 species of Swans, Geese, and Ducks.
According to the information obtained the following birds are kept

Avicultural Society recognized no territorial limits, having members
throughout the world, Mr. Buisman, who had just arrived from
Holland was especially welcome.
After a brief introduction by the Chairman, Dr. Jeffery Harrison
opened the discussion on " Colour Change in Plumage without a
Moult ", and showed specimens to illustrate his points. He was
followed by Lieut.-Commander Staples, who advanced a theory how
this change could take place.
The Chairman moved a vote of thanks to the speakers, which was
carried with acclamation.
Sir Philip Manson-Bahr, Mr. Allen Silver, Sir Godfrey Davis,
Mr. G. C. Lynch, Miss E. M. Knobel, Hon. Anthony Chaplin,
Dr. Tom Hare, and Mr. H. H. Buisman, also took part in the dis-
cussion.
A full report of the proceedings will appear in the next number of the
Avicultural Magazine.
The next meeting of the Club will be on 12th May, 1948.
The Treasurer begs to remind all members who have not already paid ,
that subscriptions (5$.) became due on 1st January, 1948.

CORRESPONDENCE
SPECIAL NUMBERS OF THE AVICULTURAL MAGAZINE
Your correspondent " Alpha " has certainly trodden on quite a large number of
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.987481619047619" page_id="56311472"  page_num="66" year="" vol="">
toes--mine seldom register during the cold weather--but as many of us have become
accustomed to hard blows and unexpected digs from all quarters during the past
few years, it is doubtful whether he will have the satisfaction of knowing how many.
My real object in writing, however, is to enter a mild protest against his suggestion
that special numbers, i.e. issues dealing only with a particular family or species
should be discontinued. I feel sure there are many readers like myself who rather
welcome them.
Quite a number of bird lovers would be glad to keep other species, but owing
to lack of space, pockets with two holes instead of one, little leisure, or for some other
reason, have to confine their activities to one kind.
It does not mean that these aviculturists are not interested in others. Quite the
contrary ; and to take up a copy devoted entirely to Parrakeets, Waterfowl, or
Birds of Prey, for instance, would mean one or two hours of interesting reading.
The special issues I have been able to peruse have proved to be very enlightening.
In the event of one's wishing to embark on further adventures, it is nice to be able
to refer to the index and find an issue devoted to the birds you hope to add to your
collection. Apart from this, it is interesting to compare habits, methods of feeding,
breeding, and rearing, and much can be learned that could be usefully applied.
As there does not appear any reasonable probability of our discovering tucked
away in a remote corner of the globe a Moa or Dodo I agree that a special number
would prove of little interest.

As Secretary of the Avicultural Society, I would like to say in answer to " Alpha's "
letter on special numbers of the Avicultural Magazine, that I get more requests from
outsiders for the special numbers, especially those on Waterfowl, than I ever did
for any of the magazines on miscellaneous subjects. I would like to emphasize that
the special numbers are very much appreciated and in demand.

deal with birds I know nothing about and now am never likely to come across.

THE BLACK-CAPPED SOCIAL WEAVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98463575" page_id="56311473"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
There is an unfortunate error in the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine.
Mr. Guy Falkner in his article entitled " Notes on the Black-capped Social Weaver
(.Pseudonigrita cabanisi)," has obviously described one of the true Weavers, probably
the Spot-backed Weaver ( Sitagra nigriceps).
The Black-capped Social Weaver belongs to the sub-family plocepasserina --Sparrow
Weavers--which differ from the Weavers described by Mr. Falkner in their smaller
size, coloration (there is no difference in the colour of sexes), nesting-habits, and
habitat.
The Black-capped Social Weaver being an inhabitant of the arid parts of Kenya
has never, to my knowledge, been recorded from Mombasa. Its nest is cone-shaped,
and is not suspended as in the true Weavers.
With all these differences, I cannot understand how such an error arose.

The Food of Pigmy Parrots
Remarkably little appears to be known about the habits of Dwarf or Pygmy Parrots,
of the genus Micropsitta. There is even considerable uncertainty about their food.
Dr. Ernst Mayr in his recent Birds of the South-West Pacific , suggests that it is either
the soft abdomen of termites or certain fungi.

A Brown-headed Parrot.
A recent acquisition is a good example of the Brown-headed Parrot ( Poicephalus
cryptoxanthus, olim fuscicapillus) . It may be simply described as a Senegal or Yellow-
vented Parrot (P. senegalus) without the yellow lower breast and abdomen, with the
head and neck olive greyish-brown and horn-colour bill. Its revised specific name
presumably means " concealed yellow " and refers to the under wing-coverts.

The John Frosticic Memorial Cup.
P. H. Alderson repeated his success of last year in winning this Cup at the

Crewes was the runner-up with 16 points.

" Crystal Palace " Show.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.84922025" page_id="56311474"  page_num="68" year="" vol="">
The 75th " Crystal Palace " Championship Show was held on the 15th, 16th, and
17th January, 1948, at the Royal Horticultural Hall. The entry was larger than
that of last year, 121 against 92, and the judge, Allen Silver, must have had quite
a task in placing the awards. Condition appeared to be his main consideration.
There is no " Best Bird in Show " at the " Crystal Palace ", instead Championship
Trophies are awarded to the best bird in the Parrot-like, Seed-eater, and Insectivorous
sections. These were won respectively by E. F. Benjamin's Derbyan Parrakeet,
T. Crewes's Red-headed Parrot Finches, and G. C. Lynch's Donaldson's Touracou.
The six Parrot-like classes attracted 46 entries, and the winners were P. H. Alder-
son's Levaillant's Parrot, E. F. Benjamin's Masked Lovebird, C. Laidman's Stanley
Parrakeet, W. P. Bland's Rock Pebblers, P. A. Birch's King Parrakeets, and E. F.
Benjamin's Derbyan Parrakeet.
The class for common small seed-eaters was the largest and contained twenty-
seven entries. Mrs. K. M. Scamell repeated her " National success " and won with
St. Helena Waxbills ; P. J. Allerston was second with Green Avadavats, and
T. Crewes third with Orange-breasted Waxbills. T. Crewes's Red-headed Parrot
Finches and Ruficaudas were the best of the rarer small seed-eaters.
A.O.S. Seed-eaters was a good glass of 23, and the winner proved to be J. E.
Davis's Queen Whydah, awarded the special for best bird not qualifying for a Trophy :
runners-up were T. Crewes's Melba Finches and Mrs. Morton-Hicks's Violet-eared
Waxbills.
The three classes for insectivorous birds were won by O. E. Dunmore's Jay-Thrush,
with his Purple-headed Starling second ; T. Corrall's Red-vented Bulbuls ; and
G. C. Lynch's Donaldson's Touracou, with his "National" Champion Blue Satin
Bower Bird second.
The remaining class for hybrids and abnormally-coloured birds contained no great
novelties, and was won by S. N. Pinfield's Zebra Finches, silver variety.

Green Conure.
E. N. T. Vane has recently obtained a pair of Green or White-eyed Conures
(.Aratinga leucophthalmus) . This large macaw-like Conure was commonly imported
about a hundred years ago, but during recent years it has only been obtainable very
occasionally. It has not yet been bred in Great Britain, and the only satisfactory
record is of one young one reared at the Adelaide Zoo, 1936-37 (Minchin, A.M .,

Additions to the London Zoo.
December , 194J. There were twelve new arrivals during the month. Perhaps
the most interesting was a Martinique Gallinule (. Porphyrula martinicus ) that flew on
board R.M.S. Highland Brigade when passing Pai Island, near Rio de Janeiro. Another
" stray " was a Gannet ( Sula bassana ) found near Bicester. Three Mikado Pheasants,
one Impeyan Pheasant, and three Red-crested Pochards were obtained by purchase ;
and a Chestnut-breasted Teal was presented by Terry Jones. Seventy-nine Budge-
rigars were bred in the Menagerie during the year.

Galapagos Penguins Nesting in Florida.
Readers will remember that in A.M., 1947, p. 76, attention was called to the fact
that in 1946, the pair of Galapagos Penguins (Spheniscus mendelius) owned by Mr. and
Mrs. Calvin P. Bentley had hatched two young ones which unfortunately soon
died. In 1947, two further eggs were laid, but in spite of steady incubation, neither
hatched--possibly on account of the severity of the weather.

DETAILS ON THE KEEPING OF HUMMING BIRDS

The Copenhagen Zoo has bought, in the course of five years,
Humming Birds from different transports. Below I will tabulate the
experience gained with regard to the keeping and care of these birds.
The manner in which the data is compiled makes it possible to follow
the life history of each bird. In the column where the species are
given I have briefly mentioned characteristics such as docility and
show- value. The column " Remarks 55 contains data on the cause and
symptoms of death. It is my hope that later on, when others have
published their experiences on the keeping of these diminutive
birds, it will be possible to ascertain the cause of the failure in
some cases.

<bodyText confidence="0.982382548387097" page_id="56311488"  page_num="76" year="" vol="">
The first Humming Birds acquired for Copenhagen--the first live
Humming Birds ever displayed in the whole of Scandinavia--were
bought by us on the 17th May, 1935, from Fockelmann (Hamburg).
These birds were caught in the Pernambuco region. Cordier, the
collector, acclimatized them and took them by boat to Le Havre.
From there they were taken via Paris by aeroplane to Hamburg.
Here I bought twenty-two birds and took them by aeroplane to
Copenhagen.
On the 22nd October, 1935, we bought a further eight Chrysolampis
mosquitus L. from Fockelmann (Hamburg) ; the place where these
birds were caught is unknown.
On the 22nd June, 1936, we again bought twelve Humming Birds
from Fockelmann (Hamburg) ; I went to Hamburg and took the
birds by aeroplane to Copenhagen. Cordier had caught these birds in
French Guiana and in the Brazils. On the 28th August, 1936, we
bought a further seven Humming Birds from the same firm and
I took them by aeroplane from Hamburg to Copenhagen.
On the 18th June, 1937, I went to Hamburg, bought fifteen
Humming Birds from Fockelmann, and took them by railway to
Copenhagen. Cordier had likewise caught these birds.
Finally, ten Humming Birds were bought from Fockelmann
(London). I fetched these birds on the 8th July, 1938, from the
Hanover Zoo and took them by railway to Copenhagen. It is unknown
where these birds were caught. In my opinion it will pay to transport
Humming Birds by aeroplane whenever this is possible, thereby avoiding
having to resort to forcible feeding of delicate birds during transport.
If covering long distances by rail, this will be absolutely necessary,
but rather difficult. Our Humming Birds turned out to be an excellent
show. They have been mentioned repeatedly in the newspapers and
have attracted many visitors. The following species lived from the
17th May, 1935, to the 5th June, 1945, in the Copenhagen Zoo :--

That is to say that of the seventy-four Humming Birds kept here in
Copenhagen twenty-eight birds (= 38 per cent) lived here for more
than one year ; eight birds (=11 per cent) more than two years,
and five birds (=7 per cent) more than three years. One bird
(= about 2 per cent) lived here for more than seven years. In view
of the small experience hitherto made with regard to the keeping of
these species, the result is to be considered rather satisfactory. One
Bellona christata L. attained the greatest longevity here, viz. 3 years
346 days, and one Chlorostilbon aureiventris egregius Heine nearly eight
years (from the 18th June, 1937, to the 5th June, 1945).
It was, of course, incomprehensible to me why so many apparently
healthy and lively Humming Birds died suddenly and unexpectedly
since the month of June, 1940. I investigated the food and everything
most carefully, but was unable to find any acceptable cause. Therefore
I asked our veterinary surgeon, Mr. A. Bang-Olsen, at the Royal
Veterinary College in Copenhagen, to examine microscopically a
Bellona christata L., which died on the 1st June, 1940. Mr. Bang Olsen
ascertained that the animal was full of tape-worms, no less than ten
worms being found in this bird. Later on Mrs. Elise Wesenberg-Lund,

M.A. (Zoological Museum, Copenhagen), determined these tape-
worms as belonging to the Taenia group. The Swiss, Mr. Fuhrmann,
has described a Taenia species found in Humming Birds as Anonchotaenia
trochili. It is assumed that some of the birds that died suddenly after
the ist April, 1940, also had these tape-worms.
On the 1 st January, 1945, I have therefore only one Humming
Bird left, viz. one Chlorostilbon aureiventris egregius Heine. This bird is
living peaceably together with two Blue Honey-eaters ( Cyanerpes
syaneus L.) in the Humming Bird cage. In order not to run any risk
I have only placed two such birds in the cage, as I first wish to see
whether these will die of tape-worms too.
With regard to the Chrysolampis mosquitus that died on the 30th
July, 1939, I wish to add the following comments : The bird frequently
had fits (the first time on the 1 ith February, 1939). The animal threw
its head back, fluttered wildly about in the cage, finally dropped to
the bottom with closed eyes and rapidly turned round about itself.
The bird was removed from the cage without delay and taken to
a dark and cool place. After some minutes the fit was over. When
the cage door was opened suddenly and the bird was frightened
thereby, the fits immediately returned. Various other Chrysolampis
mosquitus L. have had these fits too. In definite species I have not
observed similar attacks.
With regard to the equipment of the Humming Bird cages with
vegetation and plants in flower, Monstera deliciosa , with its numerous
air-roots, has turned out to be excellent and frequently used as perches
by the Humming Birds ; the same thing applies to stone-ferns as, for
instance, Nephrolepis whitmanni , various Erica , Begonia , and Solanum
capricastrum, and hendersonii. The plants are sprinkled once or twice
a day with plenty of water. Some of the water should always be left
on the green leaves, and it is a lovely sight to watch the tiny birds
when bathing, nay wallowing therein. A somewhat constant tempera-
ture of minimum 20* and maximum 23 0 C. is to be recommended.
By insertion or removal of a glass plate the Humming Bird cage may
be divided or enlarged. I consider it important to give the Humming
Birds as much space as possible for flight as, in this case, they will
not quarrel much.
To facilitate the drinking for newly arrived, delicate, or moulting
birds a little clamp has been attached to the feeding vessel (see fig. 2).
Healthy and strong Humming Birds will rarely sit when drinking,
nor will they voluntarily come down to the bottom of the cage. The
clamp may be moved to and fro--according to the size of the bird.
Long-billed Humming Birds have naturally to be seated at some
distance from the drinking vessels.
The transport cages (Fig. 3) have to be cleansed most carefully,
otherwise the plumage will stick together and prevent the Humming

The cage floor is covered with a cellophane plate, which is easily
kept clean.
I further wish to mention Leptocoma zeylonica L. (Fig. 4), which was
under my care for some time. This bird died from an eye disease,
no doubt, due to avitaminose. At any rate, later on I have been
more successful, when applying more vitaminous food. During
transport to Europe the bird no doubt obtained insufficient vitamins.
Small birds as, for instance, Flower-peckers (Dicaeum), with eye
diseases have been restored to health by me by giving them food of
a high vitamin content. A few drops of orange juice in the fluid food
may be recommended for Humming Birds. In a later article I will
give an account of my experiences on the feeding of Humming Birds.

NEW BUDGERIGARS AND BENGALEES IN JAPAN

War, privations, bombing, defeat, and invasion have not entirely
stopped the ancient course of Japanese avicultural achievements.
Count G. Revedin, the Italian Representative at the Tokyo head-
quarters, and an old bird-lover, has sent me recently a coloured
chart issued by the Japanese Society of Cage Bird Breeders represent-
ing forty new varieties of Bengalees and eight of Budgerigars.
Four of the latest are sensational in that they are crested, one
even has a mane of curled feathers along the neck and on the upper
back ; the crests of the other three differ in shape. These crests
resemble those of Crested Canaries, and also of the Bengalees which
have been obtained in Japan ten or more years ago. The other four
Budgerigars show a white cap and the under parts have large white
spots. They are of the green, blue, and grey forms. Twenty of the
Bengalees are white with various even black marks and spots. The
other twenty are plain-coloured, buff, black, cinnamon, or white ;
not only most of them are crested, but they also possess manes and
frills combined in various ways much as in domestic pigeons.
Count Revedin writes also that Blue-masked Lovebirds are com-
moner to-day in Japan than the normal green ones and that both
varieties sell at the same price ; a few pairs of white ones have recently
been bred from the blues. Prices of all the different new varieties of
birds still are very high.

Report of Discussion at Meeting of British Aviculturists 5 Club
A discussion on the possibility of colour change without a moult
was held at the B.A.C. meeting on 10th March, 1948, with Miss
Barclay-Smith in the Chair.
Dr. Jeffery Harrison opened the discussion. After some introductory
remarks he gave a brief historical review of what has been, and
apparently still is, one of the greatest of ornithological controversies.
Tracing back the origin to a Captain Gartright in 1792, the views of
Hunt, a keeper of the London Zoo in 1833, Gatke, the famous
Heligoland ornithologist. Chapman, Allen, Millais, and others were
considered. After mentioning the findings of Dr. Bahr, in 1910, about
the Black-headed Gull, Dr. Harrison dealt in detail with Witherby's
review of Millais 5 British Diving Ducks , in which there was a complete
account of the controversy to that date. The evidence was so definitely
against the possibility of a colour change without moult that the
theory fell into disrepute from then, except for one lone supporter in
Abel Chapman, the Northumberland naturalist.
Dr. Harrison went on to relate how it was that he had become con-
vinced that the theory was in fact correct, at any rate in wading birds,
and he gave a demonstration on the Knot, Black-tailed Godwit, and
Redshank, illustrating his remarks with specimens and three series of
feathers taken at various dates ranging from freshly-moulted autumn
to fully-developed spring plumage. Black pigment could be seen
developing in the normal winter coloured feather towards the early
spring ; later, pale chestnut could be noticed forming, until the whole
feather took on the appearance of an anaemic spring example, which
later came into colour and was fully formed. Some of these feathers
were already worn, and all had empty quill bases, so that there could
be no question of any recent moult.
Dr. Harrison then said : " This was the evidence that I brought
forward at a meeting of the British Ornithologists 5 Club recently. 1
I was followed by Mr. B. W. Tucker, who is a well-known ornithologist
and one of the chief antagonists of the theory. I am in complete agree-
ment with him when he says that the only proof will be to keep a bird
in captivity, mark an individual feather and photograph it at different
stages. He argued that the demonstration consisted of different
individual feathers from different individual birds and that there was
no proof whatever--or even very good prima facie evidence--that the

colour or pattern of any given feather had ever been different from
what we now see. I have examined a large number of individual
birds, especially Redshanks, and I do not agree that this is correct,
because they all pass through the stages I have shown, and all at
roughly the same time of the year. If these feathers were always the
same, as Mr. Tucker has argued, then similar plumaged birds should
be met with all through the spring. But this is not so ; for instance,
Knots with black markings on their backs and nothing further are
only found in February and March, after which they have all advanced
further into spring plumage. There are, of course, the few exceptions
which do not assume any spring plumage at all. These are often
non-breeding birds which do not complete their full migration, and
are not relevant to the discussion.
" In criticizing one of my main points, that some of the spring
feathers have worn tips, and therefore cannot be new feathers,
Mr. Tucker stated : 4 No doubt in some individuals some feathers of
the new plumage may begin to come in much earlier than others, and
there is no reason why such precociously formed feathers should not
be quite appreciably abraded before the main moult sets in. 5 This
again is not in accord with my findings, and after all, I have examined
a large series of skins. Abraded feathers are very common in these
species in the month of May, too common to account for them all as
' precociously formed feathers ', which applies something unusual and,
although I freely admit that I do not know how long it takes for
a feather to become abraded, I do not believe that freshly-moulted
spring plumage could become abraded by May.
" I must add that in spite of Mr. Tucker's remarks, my faith in
the correctness of the theory remained unshaken. I do think that where
people have gone astray in the past is that they have only studied birds
in the later stages of transition, in April and May, when moult
obscures the finer colour changes. Examples in January and February
show perfectly clearly the early stages of colour change, and should be
apparent to anyone who studies the feathers carefully.
&amp;lt;# For the loan of specimens with which I was able to work out my
views I have to acknowledge with gratitude the help of the British
Museum, South Kensington, and my father, Dr. J. M. Harrison.
When I gave my talk to the British Ornithologists' Club, I ended by
saying that it seemed to me, on the basis of the evidence produced,
that the feather was not really an inert structure, even after it was fully
formed, but was capable of undergoing various changes. What these
changes are has yet to be discovered, but I expected that they would
be found to be some complicated biochemical change, leading to an
alteration in pigment. You can imagine how pleased I was when
Lieut.-Commander Staples came forward two months later with
a most excellent theory in full support of my views."

Lieut.-Commander C. P. Staples then advanced his theory how
such a change could take place and said :
" When a feather is fully formed it is to all intents and purposes
a dead structure, and once it hardens or cornifies its base seals up so
that nothing can enter it from the body of the bird.
" These two claims are relied on by the experts, who repudiate colour
change in birds. As the microscope discloses no channel of entry into
the feather base they say that nothing can enter, and so a change is
impossible in a definitive feather. Surely, if such an opening did exist
it would be a sorry state of affairs for a bird. The feather shaft would
be filled with blood or other fluid, while it would be an unfortunate
bird whose feathers continued to enlarge and grow. In either event, the
power of flight would be lost. Actually, the structure of a feather, dead,
rigid, and hollow, serves its purpose very well, but structure is one
thing and the colouring that is superimposed on structure is another.
" I disagree with the experts in that I contend that you can have
a colour change in a feather without a defined channel of entry through
its base. Primary changes, that is a transition from one coloured
pigment to another, I do not think can occur but tonal changes can
and in fact do. By tonal changes, I mean deeper gradations of the same
pigment which, in the case of melanin, involves all the greys, browns,
and blacks--a wide range of shades.
" We all know that feathers possess a slight oil content. We also
know that food of an oily nature affects the colouring of feathers at the
moult. Linseed deepens colours ; hempseed improves the tones of the
Goldfinch but sometimes darkens the Bullfinch ; the rosy hues of
Flamingoes are deficient or absent when the birds are deprived of
a crustacean diet, but restored when such a diet is provided and an
oily vehicle is necessary in colour-feeding Canaries and others with
artificial colouring agents if even assimilation is to be obtained. It also
seems to be well established that oil in the diet continues to affect by
absorption even after the moult, and it is thus reasonable to assume
that, although it may be a dead structure, a feather can still absorb
oils and fats. A microscope is not necessary to see a small drop of oil
permeating a piece of parchment, and the physical natures of parch-
ment and the cortex of feathers are similar. Hence, I see no reason
why a physiologically active substance, oil-borne, cannot permeate
feather structure and thus effect a change in colour tone. No channel
of entry will be necessary, for the cortex itself will absorb the oily
substance in the same way as parchment does.
" Oil only affects body contour feathers--it appears to have no
impression on quill feathers, that is to say the primaries and secondaries
of the wings and the large feathers of the tail. Look at the colour-fed
Canary--its quills remain pale yellow. Why is this so ? Simply
because quill feathers are attached to bone, while body contour

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989407466666666" page_id="56311497"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
feathers are embedded in fat, and oil is absorbed by fat and not by
bone* Consequently, colour changes without a moult are limited to the
body contour feathers. The quills are the instruments of flight, to
have them softened by secretions of oil would be a disadvantage.
" The changes that occur in birds appear just prior to the mating
and breeding seasons and are patent to us all. There is a general
improvement both in sheen and texture and colours tend to deepen or
clarify. You, as aviculturists, speak of birds coming into colour, we,
as field naturalists, say they are acquiring breeding plumage. We both
mean the same thing. The changes are more noticeable in feathers
carrying the fat or lipochrome pigments, that is the reds and yellows
and, indirectly, the greens. Green itself is not a pigment but a structural
colour on a yellow lipochrome base, the prismatic surface of the feather
causes the green colour. The coming up in colour of the blaze of the
Goldfinch, the improved yellows and deepened chestnuts of the
Yellow Bunting, and the clarification of the red of the Bullfinch are
common examples.
" Is it an established fact that birds are induced to commence and
carry out the sequences of the breeding cycle by hormonic secretions ?
It is too much to suggest that other secretions from the fat parts of the
birds permeate feathers at the same time and so improve their colouring
at a season when improvement is essential from a biological point of
view. Whether such secretions are connected with these hormonic
secretions is a matter for conjecture, but I would point out that some
birds change the colours of their bills at the same time by internal
secretions. I think you will agree that this conception is the logical
result of the chain of circumstances that go to make up the rhythmic
breeding cycle of birds. Thus I claim that oily secretions from the fat
parts of birds in which the body contour feathers are situated improve
texture and tone, just as linseed oil improves the surface and graining
of wood, and hair-oil deepens the colouring and adds lustre to the
human hair.
" But what about the melanin pigments, the greys, browns, and
blacks. The pigment melanin is believed to be formed in the blood-
stream and to be akin to the hormone adrenalin, which is a secretion
of the supra-renal glands near the kidneys. Though it differs from the
fat lipochromes in its origin it is found in association with these in the
same feather and occurs in amorphous granules. But melanin is also
commonly formed by a chemical process in nature. This arises through
the oxidation of the free animo-acid tyrosine, which is to be found in
all sprouting seeds, in the protein content of hempseed and, this is
important, is present in the cortex of all epidermal structures, including
feathers. Tyrosine is colourless, but if it be mixed in the atmosphere
with the fat enzyme or ferment tyrosinase--which is also colourless--
oxidation is induced and the tyrosine changes to garnet-red, then to

<bodyText confidence="0.994603311111111" page_id="56311498"  page_num="84" year="" vol="">
reddish-brown, then brown, and finally black, which is ultimate
melanin. If you expose a cut apple or potato to the air you see these
changes occur ; similar changes are apparent in the gills of some toad-
stools which pass from pink to purplish-black as the seeds ripen. It is
also the chemical source of the sepia cloud exuded by the marine
squid. So you can see it is a very common source of melanin.
" A concentrated diet of a very oily type of hempseed sometimes
induces melanism in a Bullfinch. The hempseed previously imported
from south-east Europe contained 35 per cent of oil and seems to have
been the potent form. I am of the opinion that this is caused by
tyrosine and tyrosinase, which are the only common denominators,
coupled with the fact that the Bullfinch gets inactive, greedy, and
overfat on a diet of hemp. Thus, you get a state of dis-equilibrium, with
a consequent overspill of these two substances, with the formation of
excessive melanin as the result. The Goldfinch and the Redpoll, on the
other hand, although avid hempseed eaters, always remain active
and so work off any tendency to fatness that a diet of hempseed might
induce. The Red Cardinal in captivity sometimes darkens like the
Bullfinch and for the same reason.
" Such a chemical reaction would account for the changes in
melanin markings which Dr. J. G. Harrison has found in wader's
feathers, particularly as their oily diet of mollusca and Crustacea would
be an asset to such reaction. It would also account for the appearance
of grey markings on feathers previously clear of marking and, moreover,
answer part of the extraordinary change which occurs in the plumage
of the cock Snow Bunting in spring, all of which cannot be answered by
the simple explanation of abrasion. If this were so why does not the
hen Snow Bunting change in like manner ?
" This brings me to the question of abrasion, which is claimed by
many as the only way in which colour changes are brought about in
existing feathers. Abrasion of the soft tips of feathers undoubtedly
occurs with nearly all birds, otherwise they would not need to replace
feathers annually. But I cannot agree that abrasion in the sense of
a wearing away of the feather tips by outside agencies is a satisfactory
conception by itself. This means that coming into colour is
a haphazard, happy-go-lucky sort of affair, dependent entirely on the
effects of sand, wood, twigs, and other wearing away factors of a bird's
habitat from time to time. Thus it is fortuitous in action, yet it is
exact in fulfilment, for no matter where a bird lives, whether wild or
caged, no matter when it moults, late or early, no matter what may be
its choice of habitat, each acquires nuptial plumage at the right
moment. Moreover, it seems such a wasteful proposition from the
biological point of view that an otherwise virile male should depend
for a compatible mate on the chance effect that outside agencies may
have had on its plumage. If abrasion is a mere rubbing away, why

<bodyText confidence="0.994018022222222" page_id="56311499"  page_num="85" year="" vol="">
then does the Great Tit become cleaned up before the Blue Tit in the
wild. They resort to the same habitats and undergo the same stresses
of weather and environment. Take the Linnet and Yellow Bunting--
equally compatible and sharing similar habitats, yet the former is
invariably in colour before the latter and goes to nest earlier just as
the Great Tit commences its spring song before the Blue Tit. Each
bird comes into colour when ready to mate and breed and that is the
crux of the matter.
" Now if I am right about fatty secretions permeating feathers,
surely they would tend to accelerate the dropping away of worn and
unwanted feather tips and so time the culmination of abrasion and
abrasive moult to the sexual maturity of the bird. There are some
aspects of abrasive moult in caged birds that lend support to this.
Take Linnets, Twites, and Redpolls, where the male in the wild state
discloses by abrasion those secondary sexual characters of red flushes,
the Twite on the rump, the other two on the breast and flanks. What
happens in captivity ? They never abrade out in their proper tone--
they generally remain bronze or old gold.
" While the wild bird seems to improve the half moon of colour
which lies beneath the brown tips, the captive bird does not, the colour
remains static. The distinction lies, I suggest, in their different circum-
stances. The wild bird is always faced with the competition of pro-
miscuous males just as anxious as he is to mate and breed, while the
captive bird is not so faced. Hence the latter is to a certain extent
inhibited, its secretions are less intense, and its secondary sexual
characters of red flushes become suppressed in consequence. Similarly,
the cock Snow Bunting never abrades out into the full black of the wild
specimen on back and wing coverts.
" If you have followed me thus far you will appreciate that I claim
that body contour feathers can undergo a slight colour change without
a moult as the result of a fatty secretion with or without a physio-
logically active substance in association. The colour of melanin
pigmentation may be similarly changed, greys become browns and
browns blacks, or previously blank areas disclose melanin through the
oxidation of tyrosine. Lipochrome colours would be deepened and
effect a considerable improvement in the depth of prismatic colours by
improving the tone of the underlying yellow lipochrome or black
melanin, as the case may be. Furthermore, the effect of a secretion
would be to hasten the dropping off of the light tips of feathers which
obscure colours until they are abraded away and be the means of
bringing into view secondary sexual plumage characters at the right
moment and when the bird is best fitted to mate.
" To prove all this by experiment is not easy, particularly as an
organic, free-flowing oil, comparable to that excreted by living fat is
not to be got. I have found, however, that light inorganic oils can be

absorbed by the cortex of feathers. But one does find some indirect
corroboration of this conception in two directions. First, the use by
birds of the preen gland. They normally resort to this for the dressing
of their quill feathers and not their body contour feathers and, in point
of fact, the preen gland is absent in the flightless birds and suppressed
in some forms of parrots that climb rather than fly. Assumedly the
body contour feathers receive their quota of oil from the body. On the
other hand, post-mortem changes in bird skins also disclose that fading
occurs in body contour feathers while the colours of quills remain
constant--which suggests that a drying out process takes place in body
contour feathers.
" I do not suggest a primary change of colour, for it would be quite
illogical to contemplate heavy re-pigmentation of feathers at the same
time as a bird is undergoing the functional changes and stresses of the
breeding cycle, quite apart from the fact that the deposition of new
pigment in a grown feather is mechanically improbable. Pigments as
such are not free flowing. Melanin can only pigment a feather while
the feather is connected to the blood stream while lipochrome pigments
can only pigment feathers when soft and in fat as fat and not a secretion
from fat.
" I hope that this subjective treatment of the question of colour
change without a moult will lead to a useful and instructive discussion.
I have mentioned some changes and would like to hear of more that
you, as expert and observant aviculturists, have noticed, and also
whether any of you has had experience of induced melanism in the
Bullfinch.
" I am especially appreciative of the honour you have done me in
asking me along to-night to continue the discussion so ably initiated
by Dr. J. G. Harrison, and of having the opportunity of meeting
members of the B.A.C., for I hold that ornithologists and aviculturists
should work more closely together in furtherance of their common
interest--an appreciation and love of birds and all that that implies."
Sir Philip Manson-Bahr, in a very entertaining speech, adorned by
freely-adapted quotations from Tennyson, pointed out the necessity
of a correct, well-balanced diet for birds as well as for human beings.
He said that in humans it was possible for the colour of the skin and
hair to undergo slight colour changes. The stage could be brought
about, for instance, by a protein deficiency. Body cells adapted to
specialized functions were liable to change, or even entire withering
away, and such changes could be brought about by diet ; he instanced
some of the unfortunate inmates of the concentration camps at Belsen
and Buchenwald who, although rescued alive, were doomed to die
because, owing to long deprivation and consequent disuse, the cells
adapted to absorb certain essential food substances were no longer
present in the body. Sir Philip said he was of the opinion that plumage

could assume a colour change without a moult and continued : " Much
interest has been aroused in recent years in the discovery of 6 growth
factors 3 in medicine. One especially, which has been applied to the
treatment of human disease since 1946, is pteroylglutamic acid, more
familiarly known as folic acid, or folvite.
" As so often happens it did not come out of the blue, but has a some-
what romantic history. It is probably a vitamin. For a long time it was
purely of scientific interest and was used by bacteriologists to encourage
the growth of certain bacteria in the laboratory, but soon its action
was investigated in monkeys, in which certain definite symptoms were
produced when fed on a diet deficient in folic acid. It then became
known as Vitamin M. At this time the main source of supply was
garden spinach, from which it could be isolated by a most laborious
and tedious process. Soon, however, it was found to be present in
small quantities in liver and in yeast. In 1945 it was synthesized and is
being manufactured on a large scale in America.
" When applied to human disease it has proved most beneficial in
certain types of anaemia and especially to the mysterious malady known
as sprue, but in the last year it has been applied to animals and in
America it has been shown to be a growth factor in chickens, turkeys,
and pigs. It is generally thought to be essential for nutrition and to be
concerned fundamentally with production of blood cells, as well as
with the actual absorption from the alimentary tract. Quite recently,
it has been discovered that it is concerned with the feathering of
chicks and turkey poults and in hens with ovulation. In this country
it is a very expensive drug, as it is manufactured in the land of dollars,
where, we are assured, it is now being fed by chicken farmers to their
hens to boost their egg-output. Folic acid must also be an important
factor in the feathering of wild birds as it is present in all young plants
and in germinating seeds, and is probably essential for the nutrition of
the growing shaft. In the papers which have so far appeared the
illustrations depicting the growth of the scapulary and secondaries of
the wing are most convincing.
" It may well prove to be that folic acid is concerned, through its
action on the blood, not only with the growth, but also with the
colouration of plumage.
" The subject of nutrition is fundamental ; it is also very complex.
It is obviously dependent on absorption from the intestinal tract,
especially from the small intestine. Any agent, whether chemical or
bacterial, which damages the absorptive surface of the small intestine
also interferes with nutrition. Alterations in the type of bacteria living
on the gut may profoundly affect the whole body, because these micro-
organisms are concerned with the synthesis of several vitamins which
are essential to the proper functioning of the complex machinery of
nutrition. And so it comes about that any gross change in the nature

of the food supply or bacterial contamination can bring about profound
changes in the constitution of a bird, as well as of man, and that in the
former these may be reflected in growth, colouration, and texture of
feathers, and in the latter in the appearance of the skin and in the
texture and colouration of the hair."
Mr. Allen Silver intimated that as a layman he must observe some
caution in the matter, but he always welcomed anything which would
stir up the pedants and cause them to look into and, if necessary,
refurbish summaries of detail that had been accepted as unalterable.
He first dealt with the artificial custom of colour-feeding cage birds :
pointing out that once a bird had fully grown its new plumage (except
for a chance feather growing at the time) it was useless to try to colour-
feed it until the moult ensued. It was customary to carry out this
process slightly before, during, and slightly after the period usually
assumed to cover the duration of a complete moult. He said one could
not colour-feed a white bird, as there was no zooxanthin in its plumage
to stain, but that the colour of the soft parts, bills, tarsi, eyelids, ear
lappets could be changed at all periods of the year by using colour-
food. Moreover, so far-reaching was its effect when used that the
pale yolks of hens' eggs became blood-red after a brief feeding of
a small proportion of this matter in their mash. He had found this
substance had no effect on the yellow feathers of Parrots, but as these
birds generally lacked a gall-bladder he thought that might be
accountable for the fact that in these cases the use of colour-food was
non-effectual. In allusion to certain European or British birds, he said
in the case of Goldfinches with no light tips to the frontal red head
feathers it was obvious that these areas of colour which were sandy-red
just after the moult gradually changed almost to arterial crimson by
June ; and although the huffish tips in Bramblings, Chaffinches,
Redstarts, Stonechats, etc., were doubtless in part abraded, he was not
sure that in part, even though small, there was not some colour change
from the base upwards to account for the solid colour areas of slate,
black, or red, as the case might be, which were conspicuous among such
birds in the breeding season. Commander Staples had advocated
co-operation between aviculturists and ornithologists, and had urged
frequent examination of the formers' birds. He was in complete agree-
ment that there should be all possible co-operation, but pointed out that
aviculturists were, perhaps naturally, usually somewhat unwilling to
handle their birds more often than was absolutely necessary, owing to
the possibility of adversely affecting any breeding operations.
Sir Godfrey Davis gave his experience with Avadavats in India.
On occasions when it had been necessary to keep them indoors they had
invariably quickly lost their fiery-red colour and turned a rusty-brown.
A short spell out of doors, with sunshine and daily sprayings, soon
restored the colour.

Mr. Lynch also dealt with colour-feeding and its various
aspects. He said he had recently been colour-feeding his Cornish
Chough : and although it was in full plumage it had changed
very noticeably. After some ten days it was much darker and the
plumage had taken on a new lustre.
Miss Knobel said that during the Great War her three Amazon
Parrots, fed on substitute foods, had turned yellow ; but on the
deficiencies in their diet being made good they had regained their
normal colour.
The Hon. Anthony Chaplin alluded to the colour change of the
North American Indigo Bunting and thought he remembered that the
late Dr. A. G. Butler gave to the Natural History Museum a series of
skins from the " Linnet " phase to the blue phase (nuptial dress)
which demonstrated colour change in actual feathers. He also referred
to a series of Humming Bird skins, Topazapella (Guiana King Humming
Bird) in the Paris Museum, in which the metallic colours occurred
gradually on the plain coloured feathers themselves.
Dr. Harrison explained, however, that in Humming Birds and some
other species with iridescent plumage, the apparent colouring was not
due to pigmentation but to the structure of the feathers, which acted as
minute prisms in refracting white light and reflecting its constituent
colours. Presumably the birds whose feathers were only partly metallic
were immature and had not yet developed these peculiarities of feather
structure.
Dr. Tom Hare said that he was surprised that this matter of
unalterable appearance in a feather should form a source of con-
troversy. The appearance of the skin in birds and animals in its
departure from the normal was an indication of the state of health of
the creature, and this, together with nails, bills, etc., was continually
growing and being replaced. He referred to the changes of colour
which might occur in hair attached to its follicle, and he saw no reason
why feathers attached to their nuclei should not be able to change in
hue. Feathers were not entirely dead, but forming part of a living
organism remained living structures.
The meeting concluded with a speech by Mr. Buisman who expressed
his pleasure in being able to attend the discussion. In Holland the
keeping of softbills was prohibited, and even the keeping of hardbills
was allowed to only a very limited extent. On his return he proposed
to bring to the notice of Dutch ornithologists how important and
interesting were matters associated with Aviculture. He hoped that it
would be the means of at least some being allowed to keep birds for
observation purposes, as it was evident that the prohibition now in
force was inimical to scientific progress.

By Lewis M. Campbell, Secretary, Avicultural Society of Australia
In a rash moment I offered the Editor an article on this subject
and now the bird has come home to roost. At the outset I would like
to explain that I am unable to speak of the greater part of Australia
at first hand, since I have not had the good fortune to visit any of
the other States since I became interested in aviculture. What follows,
then, is, to a very large extent, my impression gained from corre-
spondence and conversations with members of my Society from other
States and with members who have visited those States.
As a generalization one may say that the aviculturist in Australia
is a man of limited means, which usually means that his area available
for aviaries is also limited. Even those with the means and area
available for enlargement of their aviaries are finding it almost
impossible to do so owing to the scarcity of netting and shelter material:
The result is that an average collection consists of Australian Finches
or Parrots or a mixture of both with a sprinkling of foreigners. All
generalizations, however, are subject to exceptions and there are some
notable ones to this, large collections with a good variety of foreign
birds, mainly Parrots and Pheasants.
Under the climatic conditions prevailing on the mainland it is
possible to keep most birds in good condition in outdoor aviaries
with open flights throughout the year ; in the south, however, some
tropical foreigners and some birds from the rain jungles of Northern
Australia require more protected conditions. Experience has shown
that winter losses are heavy unless the shelters are properly sited and
absolutely draught free or that the flights are planted with well grown
trees and shrubs to give adequate natural protection.
Prices of Australian birds have risen a little during and since the
war, but not out of proportion to other commodities. The price of
seed was controlled until the end of last year, and since control has
been removed there has been a sharp upward rise, though this again
has not been to an unreasonable degree under the circumstances.
I will not tantalize you by quoting prices, for even with the increases
you would think we are living in an aviculturist's paradise for both
birds and seed.
In each of the capital cities, and some others, Bird Societies are
flourishing. Most of them are mainly concerned with Canaries and
Budgerigars and are showing societies. It is evident from the show
catalogues that I have seen that Finches, Parrots, and other birds
occupy only a place of minor importance as compared with Canaries
and Budgerigars in these societies. So far as I am aware my own
Society is the only non-showing one in Australia, but it is evident

from its growth in all States that there is a considerable body of bird-
keepers interested in the care and breeding of birds apart from their
show-bench possibilities. The great majority of aviculturists here are
content to breed true to type, but there are a few who like to explore
the possibilities of hybridizing and colour mutations.
At the moment there are only two avicultural publications issued
in Australia ; both commenced in the same way as roneoed sheets
for distribution among the members of the issuing society, but they
have since developed along different lines. One of these is Bird World ,
issued under the aegis of the Australian Avicultural Association located
in Sydney, and the other Australian Aviculture issued to members of
the Avicultural Society of Australia, whose headquarters are in
Melbourne.
Those responsible for the production of Bird World decided to convert
it to a commercial proposition and have had their troubles in establish-
ing and financing it. In their endeavours to meet these troubles they
have progressively widened the scope of the journal from one concerned
with aviary birds, including Canaries and Budgerigars, until it has
now become a live hobbies journal.
We, being less optimistic or energetic, have progressed more slowly
and cautiously and the expansion of the journal has been regulated
by the funds available from members 5 subscriptions. The result has
been that our journal, although retaining a modest appearance, is
growing in size and provides as much or more avicultural information
than Bird World. To date, owing to the growth of membership, it
has not been necessary to increase the almost nominal subscription
to finance the journal.
The effect of the war, so it seems to me, has been to increase interest
in aviculture, not so much, perhaps, in the way of new recruits as
amongst those already interested in the keeping of birds. Prior to
the war, crews of ships running from India, China, and other countries
used to supplement their pay by bringing to Australia hundreds of
such birds as Pekin Robins, Strawberry Finches, Spice Finches,
Java Sparrows, and Silverbills, which they sold at very low rates.
Australian Finches and some Parrots could also be obtained in
quantities very cheaply. The result was that aviaries could be kept
stocked and losses replaced at little cost. There was a tendency for
some to take the easy course and to depend on replacements rather
than breeding to maintain their collections.
With the outbreak of war the supply of birds from overseas ceased,
as did, to a very great extent, the trapping of Australian birds. The
effect was that bird-keepers, faced with the depletion of their aviaries,
became much more interested in breeding and thus insensibly became
aviculturists.
During the war the Commonwealth Health Authorities became

very conscious of the possibility of the introduction of certain stock
and other diseases not already established in Australia, and issued
very stringent regulations governing the import of live stock--possibly
over stringent in some respects. The consequence is that it is now
practically impossible for the private aviculturist to import birds
from abroad.
This position has had an interesting result in Adelaide, one of our
leading centres of aviculture. There aviculturists can obtain unlimited
quantities of termites or " white ants 55 as they are popularly called.
It is generally considered that the availability of this live food accounts
for the success of Adelaide aviculturists in breeding Australian and
foreign Finches and softbills. Being true aviculturists, never happy
unless they are trying to coax a difficult or new species to breed, they
began to look about for new worlds to conquer when no more foreigners
were available. So they have turned their attention to Australian
softbills. Some species of these, of course, have been bred previously,
but our softbills are practically a virgin field for aviculturists. Last
season four species were successfully bred and some others tried.
So far I have not heard what developments have occurred this season,
but I am sure there will have been further successes in this field as
competition is keen there to be a " first " breeder.
To sum up aviculture in Australia is still well within the reach o*
a man of modest means and is in a very healthy condition. All societies
seem to be in a sound position and to be doing useful work among
their members by talks and lectures at their meetings. The educational
side is extended to a wider field by medium of the two journals
published and the information they convey is encouraging their
readers to extend their collections, their experiments, and their
researches.

EXOTIC KINGFISHERS IN CAPTIVITY
By Jean Marie Derscheid

<bodyText confidence="0.944915119047619" page_id="56311507"  page_num="93" year="" vol="">
[Translated and reprinted from Notes Avicoles et ornithologiques , Editees par Aviornis,
by permission of the Editor. (This article was written by the late Dr. Derscheid
during his imprisonment in Brussels.)]
Although its beauty of plumage makes the special efforts needed
to accustom it to a life in captivity worth while, one is obliged to
admit that as a general rule our European Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis
ispida L.) must be considered as of little use for cages and aviaries.
Its unsociable and intractable character, its almost invincible savage-
ness, and above all the almost unsurmountable difficulty of providing
it with the necessary food (particularly live fish) to induce it to eat
willingly makes, for the majority of aviculturists, the attempts at
taming this bird, even young specimens taken from the nest, not worth
the difficulties and the inevitable troubles and complications which
have to be overcome. The European species is in fact suitable only for
those who are past masters in the art of keeping delicate and recalcitrant
birds in good condition . 1
It is also interesting to note here that the drawbacks and difficulties
are much less in the case of certain exotic species of Kingfishers ;
the difference is due in part to the more calm and confiding character
of these birds ; but above all to the fact that their food, which is highly
specialized, can be more varied and includes things more easily
obtained and supplied in good condition than a stock of live fish.
This is above all the case of the members of the sub-family of the
Halcyones which in the wild state feed mainly on large insects, small
vertebrates (lizards, small snakes, mice, etc.), on molluscs and crustacean
all caught in the most varied places (sometimes far from any water) ;
it is relatively easy to induce these birds progressively to content
themselves in captivity with a diet consisting largely of raw meat
cut in strips or little pieces, with the addition of mealworms, cock-
chafers, grasshoppers, and young sparrows and mice in the case of
the largest species, and of ants' eggs and flies or worms in the case
of the smallest. Certain specimens can eventually be induced to take
a paste similar to that given to insectivorous birds, but it is always
necessary to include a proportion of raw meat in their food. K. Neunzig
advises, with reason, that the little pieces of meat should be rolled
in some roughage (for example, crushed hemp, dried ant eggs, hair, etc.)
before giving it to them ; this gives the birds a chance to regurgitate
the indigestible matter as they do in the wild, like the birds of prey ;
1 We must mention all the same that the indigenous Kingfisher has already
figured with success in one of the Annual Exhibitions of the Ornithological Circle of
Brussels ; I also recollect that an Austrian aviculturist has achieved nesting and
complete rearing in an aviary which is undoubtedly a veritable victory.

<bodyText confidence="0.998701555555556" page_id="56311508"  page_num="94" year="" vol="">
in addition it has the advantage of preventing the raw meat from
becoming dirty or even tainted as the birds carry it about from place
to place in their cage before eating it.
The Giant Kingfishers or exotic Alcedinida are hardly more
sociable and accommodating than their European cousins ; it is
practically never possible to keep several specimens together, or to
put them with other birds whose lives they soon make insupportable
if they are not sufficiently strong to put them to death immediately.
In certain cases like the Kookaburras (Genus Dacelo) there is no diffi-
culty in keeping a pair, or even several, in one enclosure so long as
it is sufficiently large.
These Kookaburras, or Giant Kingfishers (in English : Laughing
Kingfisher ; in German : Riesenliest or Jagerliest) are perhaps the
most frequently imported alive of all the members of the whole family.
They are almost always represented in the collections of Zoological
Gardens by one or more examples which do not fail to attract the
attention of visitors, not by their plumage (which is black, grey, or
brown relieved with white), but by their tameness, their intelligence,
and above all by their deep calls which are like the peals of laughter
of a formidable human voice. The genus includes four species in
Papua, but is chiefly found in Australia, from whence comes the one
which is most frequently seen in Europe (.Dacelo gigas (Boddaert) and
which is the giant of the whole family, measuring about 45 cm. long.
These birds become astonishingly tame and quickly learn to know the
people who look after them.
Less amusing in manner and less easy to tame than the foregoing
are the smaller Kingfishers which come from time to time from
Australia or New Guinea, Malaysia, and the Indies ; on the other
hand, they have the advantage of a more highly coloured plumage,
which is sometimes extraordinarily brilliant. Some species have up
to the present very rarely reached Europe and have not figured in
the collections of the principal zoos or the big private collections.
Others, on the contrary, are imported at more frequent intervals
and one can acquire good specimens from time to time at prices
which are very moderate for the value and interest of these birds.
This is especially the case with the Sacred Kingfisher (.Halcyon sanctus
Vigors and Horsfield) which comes from Australia and the rest of Oceania
and Malaysia as far west as Sumatra. It owes its specific name to
the fact that several tribes hold it in religious veneration ; it is con-
sidered as the messenger or living symbol of Thor, God of War, by
certain Polynesians. It is a very beautiful bird whose plumage shows
a pleasing contrast between the white, washed with ochre, colour
of the eyebrows, wide ring round the neck and the underparts, and
the bright luminous blue of the top of the head, lower part of the
back and the rump. The wings, the feathers of the tail, and the top

of the mantle are a bluish-green mixed with black, a large patch of
black decorates the side of the head from the base of the beak to the
ear and extends in a narrow line on the nape. The sexes are similar.
The Sacred Kingfishers, like most of the Halcyones, differ from
the true Kingfishers in that they nest in the holes of hollow trees and
not at the end of burrows dug in the earth. In the wild state they
not only frequent the banks of waterways and the sea (particularly
the clumps of mangroves) of the coast, but also quite dry regions,
such as the savannahs of the interior of the islands, and the steppes
studded with eucalyptus and acacias.
This beautiful species, frequently seen in Zoological Gardens,
sometimes appears in the collections of private aviculturists and to
my knowledge was recently in the collection of one of the most
experienced aviculturists in rare birds in Belgium, Monsieur Leigeois.
Among other members of the genus Halcyon which are occasionally
imported is the most eastern species Halcyon smyrnensis (L.), which
figures on the list of indigenous birds of the south-east of Europe, but
is especially characteristic of the Indian region, ranging from Asia
Minor to the south of China. It is remarkable for the coral red colour
of the beak. The Paradise Kingfishers (Genus Tanysiptera) are without
doubt the most beautiful representatives of the family ; they combine
with a colouring which is gorgeous but delicately shaded, a slender-
ness of form which is lacking in certain of their relatives whose
appearance is more stumpy ; in the Tanysiptera originating principally
in the Malaysian and Papuan regions the wings are quite pointed
and the tail elongated, the two median feathers of which are much
longer than the others and are rachet or spoon shape at the tips,
a queer characteristic which is met with in very different groups of
birds (Momotidae, Coraciidae, Paradiseidae, Dicruridae, Trochilidae,
Palaeornithinae), but which are all arboreal. These Kingfishers are
rare in captivity.
Of equally singular appearance are the Pelargopsis or Stork King-
fishers, of which some isolated specimens appear from time to time
on the European market, usually coming from Singapore or Celebes.
The beak is of very characteristic shape and generally vivid in colour
(blood red) ; these birds can easily be accustomed to a diet with
a basis of raw meat, but it is a good thing to give them small fish--
dead or alive--from time to time.
The same remark applies to the Kingfishers of the genus Ceryle ,
which generally have less brilliant colouring which is not usual in this
family ; white, black, and grey usually dominating in their plumage.
Most of the species of this genus are peculiar to America, but there

96 JEAN MARIE DERSCHEID-EXOTIC KINGFISHERS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995947576923077" page_id="56311510"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
species in a wild state in large numbers on the banks of the lakes in
Central Africa ; one can observe that this bird has not the jealous
and surly disposition of the other Kingfishers, and they can often
be seen fishing in company in little parties of five or six birds. It is
rarely imported alive into Europe.
Central Africa, and the Belgian Congo in particular, moreover
possess Kingfishers about which everything remains to be discovered
as to their behaviour in captivity ; some of them of a size little larger
than that of the Colibris , rival the latter in the gorgeousness of their
plumage where the most iridescent colours, emerald green, turquoise
blue, sapphire, blend with the deepest tones of reddish brown and
tawny, with a rare intensity. These small species have a largely
insectivorous diet, which makes it easier to acclimatize them and
above all facilitates their feeding during their transport by boat to
Europe. Let us hope that some day some aviculturist returning from
Africa will be tempted to undertake such an interesting importation.
The private importations of this genus, especially the rare King-
fishers of New Guinea and the neighbouring archipelagoes, have
given completely satisfactory results and enriched the collections of
some aviculturists--Mr. Ezra among others--with specimens of high
value. They are unfortunately still too exceptional and this proves
that the birds of this family have still not gained the popularity which
they merit, especially among aviculturists in our country. I hope
I have been able to show them in these few lines that the special
difficulties to be faced in keeping these magnificent birds in cage or
aviary do not justify avoiding them.

honour of Mr. Lee S. Crandall and Mr. Freeman M. Shelly. The
Committee was doing everything possible to make the occasion a
memorable one, and it was hoped that members would attend in
force to meet the Club's distinguished guests.
Miss Barclay-Smith showed a Japanese coloured chart of crested,
frilled, and mottled Budgerigars and Bengalees, sent by M. JeanDelacour.
Mr. K. A. Norris showed coloured slides of birds he had photo-
graphed on the Pembroke coast, Skomer and Grassholm. Amongst
the more interesting were Dipper, Buzzard, at both tree and cliff
eyries, Chough, Great Black-backed Gull and Oyster-catcher nesting
on the mainland ; of Gannets and Kittiwakes on Grassholm ; and
of Peregrine Falcon, Herring, Great and Lesser Black-backed Gulls,
Kittiwake, Razorbill, Guillemot, Puffin and Shag on Skomer ; also
illustrations of the really remarkable flora of the island and of the
common toad and the Skomer Vole, a species which has become
modified through isolation on the island.
The Chairman, moving a vote of thanks to Mr. Norris, said he
had rarely seen a more interesting series of photographs. Mr. Norris
was known as an ardent aviculturist, but it was obvious that he was,
in addition, a front rank photographer and a very observant ornitho-
logist. Carried with acclamation.
A summary of Mr. Norris's remarks will appear in the next number

Avicultural Society of South Australia : The Medal Awards
Dr. Alan Lendon kindly sends information that the medal of the Avicultural
Society of South Australia has just been awarded for the following breeding successes
during the year ending February, 1948 :--
White-browed Babbler ( Pomatostomus superciliosus) . R. W. B. Afford.
Yellow-vented Blue Bonnet ( Psephotus xanthorrhous) . A. H. Lendon.
White-browed Wood Swallow ( Artamus superciliosus ). R. W. McKechnie.
Masked Wood Swallow {Artamus personatus). R. W. McKechnie.
White-fronted Chat {Epthianura alhifrons). F. F. Welford.
Crimson Chat {Epthianura tricolor ). A. G. Owen-Smyth.
Southern Yellow Robin {Eopsaltria australis ). F. Bass6.
The Silver Medal for the most outstanding breeding achievement, 1947-8, was
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.996837909090909" page_id="56311511"  page_num="97" year="" vol="">
awarded to F. Basse for the Southern Yellow Robin. Dr. Lendon writes : " As you
will see all the birds bred are Australian, and with the exception of the Blue Bonnet,
all are softbills. As a result of the restrictions on importations many fanciers have
turned to the native softbills, many of which are most attractive, which have been
almost completely neglected in the past. There are very few Australian Finches and
Parrots left now that have not been bred locally, and many of the foreign Finches
that were imported in pre-war days were bred, and those that weren't have died out.
A nice shipment of African Finches, including such rarities as Twin-spots (Green)
and Black-cheeked Waxbills was recently obtained by a local fancier under a special
permit, and it is greatly to be hoped that he will succeed in establishing many of
these species."

Additions to the London Zoo.
January, 1948. The arrivals during the month numbered eleven. The most
interesting was a Blue-throated Brown Sunbird (Cyanomitra cyanolaema ) from the
Gold Coast. Other newcomers were Stone Curlew, Common Guillemot, Common
Scoter, and Gannet.
Taken on the strength at Whipsnade were twenty-three Jungle Fowl and three
North American Turkeys, bred in the Park during 1947 ; and three Common
Sheld-Duck and eight Pintail, received in exchange.
February, 1948. The registered additions during the month were eleven : two
Indian White-eyes, two Stock Doves, two Wood Pigeons, one Grey Lag Goose, one
Bar-headed Goose (male), one Puna Teal (female), one Ghiloe Wigeon (female),
and one Black-headed Gull. Apart from transferences from Regent's Park the only
new arrival at Whipsnade was an Emperor Goose.

Breeding Splendids in California.
Members interested in Grass Parrakeets will be pleased to know that Mr. David
West, of Montebello, California, is succeeding in his efforts to build up a stock of
Splendids. At present he has four breeding pairs and three younger pairs. Last year
two breeding pairs reared seven fine young, four reared by one pair and three by
the other. Two other pairs nested, but the eggs were infertile, probably owing to
the immaturity of the males. Apart from the Splendids at Montebello probably
the only birds of this species in the United States are pairs Mr. West sent to Mr.
F. H. Rudkin, Jr., of Fillmore, California, and Chicago's Brookfield Zoo.

Gerald Durrell in the Cameroons. Writing on 12th February, Yealland says :
" Durrell and I are at present about 180 miles north of Victoria and we have some
nice birds and animals. The natives say they know Swindern's Love-bird when I show
them a water colour sketch of it. Plenty of Blue Plantain-eaters here, but the natives
are hopeless at catching things in the trees. However, the Plantain-eaters are, I believe,
nesting now, so I might get some young ones and hand-rear them. I've four species
of Sun-bird--the Collared, Grey-chinned, Blue-throated Brown, and Olive-bellied ;
also some Orange-breasted Akalats, one Blue-shouldered Robin-Chat, and a good
many other various insectivorous birds."

Parson Finch X Long-tailed Grassfinch Hybrids
Eric Rowe, Port Elizabeth, South Africa, writes that he has had considerable
success in breeding the above cross. The original hybrid was mated to a hen Grass-
finch, and during the past two years forty young have been bred. The young ones
are now breeding inter se and so far twenty have been reared. He says " the peculiar
part about it is that half the chicks have a blood red beak and the other half have
a yellow beak. The red-beaked are very similar to a Heck's Grassfinch, but I've
never owned a Heck's, so none of us, including the Wild Bird Judge, can tell where
the red comes from--it makes the bird look very, very pretty
Winkles for Softbills
A correspondent in Cage Birds says he offered some winkles to his Thrush. They
were eaten with apparent enjoyment, and henceforth they will be supplied regularly.
It would be interesting if any member who has tried this " sea-snail " as a supple-
mentary item would give his experience.--A. A. P.

A Weaver X Canary Hybrid.
Mr. E. G. Rowe, of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, writes that he has bred a hybrid
which he claims is a cross between a Madagascar Weaver cock and a Canary. The
young one was found dead when fully fledged and flying. Five eggs in a second
nest disappeared, and, at the time of writing (16th February, 1948), the Canary
was starting to build again, but Mr. Rowe thought it was then too late in the season
for the attempt to come to anything.

It would appear that " Alpha 95 has not made himself exactly popular with his
suggestions respecting the Magazine, and the sooner he recants and stops treading
on other Members' toes--although this was not the end to which he was appealing !--
the sooner we can all settle down and let the Editor and Secretary get on with their
work again, the better.
" Once upon a time 99 " Alpha 99 was Hon. Secretary to the Foreign Bird Club,
and he had more than a passing acquaintance with the Editorial duties of Bird Notes,
to which he was in the early days a fairly regular contributor, so he happens to know that
the duties of these two offices are by no means a sinecure--not because Members are
unwilling to help, but just because they are apt to be a little forgetful.
As it may happen that any and every Member may be condemned for his " wrong 59
doings, " Alpha, 99 although he has no wish to force himself into the limelight, asks
to be allowed to withdraw his anonymity and to sign himself,

MOTMOTS IN CAPTIVITY

Translated and reprinted from Aviornis, Encyclopedie international de
VElevage , No. 2-3, May-October, 1943, by permission of the Editor.
(This article was written by the late Dr. Derscheid during his
imprisonment in Brussels.)
The little family of Motmots (Momotidae, or, as some authors call
them, the Prionotidae), with its peculiar characteristics, has always
particularly interested me, as much from the point of view of their
zoological peculiarities as for their behaviour both in the wild state
and captivity.
They are all semi-tropical birds, that is to say they originate in that
large natural biographical region which comprises a part of Mexico,
the Antilles, and Central and South America and which in its special-
ized flora and fauna differs as an homogenous entity from the semi-arctic
region (North America) where the animals and plants more resemble
the forms of the north of the Old World (Palearctic).
The Motmots, which are birds of medium, or small, size belong to
a group which the old ornithologists placed under the name of
passerine syndactyles or passerine levirostres ; the first of these terms
alludes to a very specialized characteristic, that is to say the three
toes of the foot which point forwards are joined together differing
from the thick thumb which points backwards ; this coalescing can,
according to the case, have one, two, or even three phalanges
and is evidently in keeping with a strictly aboreal kind of life ; this
morphological character is again found not only in the other families
of passerine syndactyles (Bee-eaters or Meropedae, Kingfishers or
Alcedinidae, Hornbills or Bucerotidae, Hoopoes or Upupidae), but
also in other groups of vertebrates specially adapted to an arboreal
life, where the foot must form a sort of pincer sufficiently rigid to grip
the branches with force but without fatigue (such is the case of

certain monkeys and also with several reptiles, such as the
Chameleons). It is evident that the member thus modified ceases to
be suitable for assisting easy progress on the ground, except on rare
occasions and with obvious reluctance, which corresponds to the
awkwardness shown by the movements. It may be emphasized that
this anatomical provision does not in the least facilitate jumping
from branch to branch, or climbing, and it is not found in the true
climbing birds (Parrots, Treecreepers, for example) or in the birds
that hop (passerine singing birds) where the toes are generally free,
quite independent, and ready to be adapted to a large variety of
supports.
The group of levirostres, in which many ornithologists of the last
century, following Cuvier, placed the Motmots, was formed by the
grouping of the non-singing passerines which had usually large or
very large beaks, though fine, and of thin texture and unfitted for
tearing prey to pieces (as do the raptores), or crushing hard seeds
like the hardbill passerines or the psittiacine birds. The levirostres
include the closely related families of the Motmots (Rollers,
Kingfishers, Hornbills) but one must take into consideration that the
same character of the shape of the beak is found in birds of evidently
very different origin, as for example certain zygodactyles (Toucans
and certain Cuckoos and Barbets particularly).
However it may be decided to place these birds systematically, one
can always recognize the Motmots by their feet, with three anterior
toes joined together and the enlarged " palm ", and by their relatively
large but fine beak with its slightly curved tip.
Contrary to what is shown by their relatives of the old world,
Bee-eaters (Meropidae) which they resemble in characters of structure
and in habits, the edges of the beak are not straight and smooth, but
toothed like a saw, a peculiarity which is found in various groups of
fruit-eating birds (Toucans, Hornbills, etc.). The tip of the beak is
not curved in a hooked point, which is an easy means of distinguishing
the Motmots from their other relatives the Rollers (Coraciidae).
We have already said that the Motmots are closely adapted for an
arboreal life, linked with their perching habits ; they are essentially
birds of the forest and their general coloration, where various shades
of green are always the dominating note, is evidently in keeping with
this particular habitat and plays a protective role. Travellers who
have studied Motmots in their native countries describe them as being
difficult to see in the dense vegetation, added to this their temperament
is remarkably calm ; they never betray their whereabouts by their
movements, but spend hours almost immovable on the same branch
which serves them as an observation post. They have a curious habit
which consists of apparently playing with their tails, and amuse
themselves without apparent reason by balancing movements from

left to right or see-sawing backwards and forwards. This tail composed
of ten or twelve rectrices, moreover, presents a remarkable appearance,
the lateral pairs of feathers are of various lengths which gives the
whole a tiered appearance ; while the pair of median rectrices is
definitely longer than the neighbouring feathers. The part which
protrudes is bare of barbs for a certain length, but ends in a little
round or elliptical rachet which the ornithologists call a spatulate
tail ; the question has been discussed for a long time as to whether
the feathers already have this appearance from their growth after
each moult, or whether the bare space is caused by subsequent action
of the bird destroying the barbs of this part of the rectrices with its
beak.
It seems that so far as Motmots in captivity are concerned one
could have well shown that the central feathers of the tail have a
normal appearance after their growth, but that the barbs of the
" critical zone " are particularly fragile and frail and are quick to
wear out and disappear when the bird has for a certain time cleaned
and smoothed these feathers by passing them between the toothed
edges of the beak (as it does, moreover, with the other feathers).
Motmots are birds that nest in holes either in the earth (burrows
like those of the Kingfishers and Bee-eaters) or more often in hollow
trees like the Rollers, Kookaburras, and Hornbills ; like all these
birds the eggs are white and not numerous (two to four) and the
young remain a relatively long time in the nest. The two parents--
whose plumage is, moreover, identical--take it in turns to brood the
eggs and share the care of the young. The rest of the year it appears
that the Motmots usually live a solitary life ; they have not, at any
rate, the sociable instincts of the Bee-eaters and the families appear
to break up more quickly than those of the Hornbills, Hoopoes, and
Rollers, which one sees flitting about in small parties for months.
The diet of the Momotidae is distinctly mixed and comprises on
one hand a large proportion of juicy fruits and tender soft berries
and on the other of numerous small living animals ; chiefly insects
of all kinds, but also many little vertebrates such as lizards, small
snakes, mice, even sometimes young birds. The living prey is seized
(and the same is the case with the Rollers) by the same method as
used by the Flycatchers. The bird immobile, but attentive, on its
perch, marks its victim with its eye, darts from its observation post,
captures it in flight, and returns to take up its position on the same
branch against which the prey is generally hammered or killed with
sharp blows of the beak before being devoured.
In captivity the food of Motmots does not present any difficulties ;
it is composed of a paste (the mixture for Thrushes or Nightingales is
perfect) and of fresh or dried fruit according to the season ; figs and
dates cut into pieces, dried raisins and sultanas swollen by soaking

them in tepid water, berries of elder, service tree, even of the juniper,
bananas cut in pieces, apples, pears, gooseberries, grapes, all are
accepted with pleasure by the birds. It is a good thing besides to
give them, once or twice a week, some animal food, alternating, for
instance, raw meat (absolutely fresh !) cut in thin strips and insects
(meal-worms, cockroaches, cockchafers). For the largest species
a young mouse or a little Sparrow occasionally are a treat. The
smallest species of Motmots (although rarely imported) certainly
would appreciate fresh or dried ants' eggs. Several authors have
regarded Motmots in captivity as being of little interest on account
of their too quiet dispositions, and for the long hours which they spend
immobile on their perches. It is certainly a serious reproach in the
eyes of those who do not wish to keep more than a small number of
birds, but nevertheless to have every satisfaction ; more lively subjects,
most of all good singers or certain Parrots, better supply the needs
of this category of aviculturist. On the other hand, the Motmots are
excellent subjects to include in a large and varied collection of living
birds ; in a room with many birds in cages their tranquillity cannot
but be appreciated, on the contrary, as a restful quality. Their calls,
which are not too frequent, are sonorous and fluting and not at all
raucous. Their name is onomatopoeic ; others have described it as
a soft resonant call rather like the syllables " hou-tou, hou-tou ".
In spite of their not very sociable disposition they have not the
surly and belligerent nature of most of their relations (Rollers, King-
fishers) and one can put several specimens together without risk, or
let them share an aviary with other species of the same, or of about
the same, size. They support, in perfect health, life in a cage for
many years providing their quarters are sufficiently large (70 cm.
long is in my opinion the minimum for a single Motmot, and 1 m.
long for a pair) and the food suitable and sufficiently varied. I am
nevertheless convinced that the best means of keeping and studying
these beautiful birds in captivity is by giving them the same treatment
which one usually does for pairs of large Parrots, that is to say an
aviary sufficiently large for each&amp;apos; pair of birds with proportionate
shelter, and well lighted (warmed during the winter unless the birds
pass the bad weather in a cage indoors). With such conditions I am
convinced that there would be nothing to prevent Motmots breeding
in captivity and thereby enabling one to study all their habits closely
and in detail ; as nesting boxes the trunk nest boxes of the big Parrots
hung in a shady part of the aviary would certainly suffice.
All the same, it does not seem that the possibility of breeding these
birds has fempted aviculturists sufficiently well equipped to undertake
it with chance of success ; and most of the Motmots which arrive in
Europe appear to get stranded in the cages of Zoological Gardens,
the last places where anyone appears to bother about experiments of

this kind. One of the difficulties certainly lies in the similarity of the
sexes, with the result that it is almost impossible to find reproductive
couples without trial. A greater experience of the birds of this family
would perhaps reveal a means of distinguishing the males from the,
females.
Several species of Motmots appear from time to time (never in
large numbers) on the European market ; they do not differ from
each other except by origin, size, and certain details of coloration
in the plumage. The species shown in the illustration, the Brazilian
Motmot (Momotus momota (L)), is by far the most frequently imported.
Its plumage of a beautifully deep olive green, darker on the back,
is relieved by spots of rusty brown on the throat, flanks, and lower
tail coverts, and by the black colour of the sides of the head, wings,
and tail, the large feathers being edged with blue or green. The
forehead, eyebrows, and a strip surrounding the black band from the
side of head to the nape are of a magnificent colour of a brilliant
turquoise blue. The total length of the birds can be as much as
50 cm., of which more than half is the tail. It is the only species of
Motmot which up to the present I have been able to include in my
own collection--already many years ago--but I hope to have the
opportunity one day of studying more completely in an aviary the
behaviour of these interesting birds.

By Arthur A. Prestwich
After twenty-six years a new name appears bn the cover as Hon.
Secretary and Treasurer. Some, especially amongst the older members,
will probably from force of habit send their subscriptions to Miss
Knobel, but they are asked to try and remember not to do so. During
her long term of selfless service to the Society Miss Knobel has written
many thousands of letters, and indefatigable though she has been she
now feels she has done enough in that direction, so spare her the
needless trouble of forwarding them to me.
I consider myself very fortunate in succeeding a Secretary such as
Miss Knobel, as I am taking over the affairs of a well-organized and
financially sound Society. I will have, in addition, the benefit of
drawing on her great experience. How different is the position now
to the state of affairs when she first assumed office ! Her predecessor
had recently died and everything was in complete confusion. The
finances of the Society were " in the red " and at her first Council
Meeting it was necessary to appeal for funds to carry on. The Council
rose to the occasion and subscribed liberally, otherwise Miss Knobel's
tenure of office might have been twenty-six years shorter ! Since then
Miss Knobel has nursed the finances of the Society, so that to-day
there is a respectable balance at the bank. This balance is not an
indication that further donations are not required. They very definitely
are, for it must be borne in mind that in the main the accumulated
funds are due to the fact that for the past seven years the Avicultural
Magazine has been a bi-monthly. When the happy day eventually
comes and it can once more appear monthly, the high costs of
production will inevitably make very considerable inroads into any
reserves.
Members often inquire whether there is any chance of the Magazine
reverting to monthly publication. The answer, regrettably, is that
there is little likelihood. Apart from the paper situation, which is
not absolutely insurmountable, the main difficulty lies in the great
shortage of " copy ". Only those closely associated with the Editor
know the effort needed to produce each number. Qn several occasions
it has been felt that at long last all sources have been tapped and not
nearly enough material obtained for a number. But still, somehow,
another number appears and the continuity remains unbroken.
If members would but realize the difficulties of editing they would
read their Magazines thoroughly from cover to cover. The Editor
makes a point of including in the Magazine only such matter as
should be of direct interest to members, and it is sometimes a little
disheartening to find that some members, at least, skip quite a lot of
the contents. The shortage of material is in no way due to apathy

or lack of enthusiasm on the part of members, but to the fact that
the vast majority have almost no birds about which to write.
And this leads to two further questions frequently asked. Are we
likely to get any birds ? And is the Avicultural Society making any
efforts towards this end ? The reply is that the Executive has done,
and is doing, everything possible, but, unfortunately, so far with a
conspicuous lack of success. Birds of any description may only be
imported under licence from the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade
steadfastly refuses to grant licences to any other than, or on behalf of,
accredited Zoos and scientific institutions ; and then only for limited
numbers of softbills and hardbills of special interest, rarity, etc. It is
impossible to obtain any satisfactory reason for the present attitude.
Each of several Ministeries suggests that the decision does not rest
with it alone. The Board of Trade mumbles something about the
Ministry of Food, and they say it's the Ministry of Transport, who,
to complete the circle, say it's the Board of Trade ; so one is back
where one started.
A typical example of what might be called obstruction. A few
months ago a member resident in Sarawak offered to send the Society
a collection of fifty specimens of a local Starling, for free-distribution
amongst our members. It was not a particularly interesting species,
but the consignment was to be in the nature of an experiment. If it
arrived safely it was proposed to send other varied and better
collections. The position was explained to the Board of Trade, but
they refused to make any concession from their ruling that " Licences
are not being issued at the present time to cover importations of this
nature, and it is regretted the Department are unable to make any
exception in the circumstances of your case ".
It is all the more galling, therefore, when one hears of a well-known
London dealer being granted import licences for large numbers of
birds, but only conditional on their re-export. One recent consignment
of nearly a thousand was passed on to Belgium. Surely the need for
currency is not so desperate that not even a small proportion of the
birds passing through this country could remain.
As they say in Lancashire : " It isn't always dark at 4 o'clock,"
and seemingly we must be patient yet a little longer. But it's hard,
very, very hard !

Summary of the paper read at B.A.C. Meeting, 12th May, 1948.
Grassholm lies 17 miles out from St. Davids and is a barren rock of
22 acres in extent with no fresh water. Access is difficult owing to
treacherous tides and one of the most dangerous currents in the world
known as the Wild Goose Race.
It is the home of the only Gannet colony on the English and Welsh
coast. Gannets were known to be established there over a century
ago and it is believed that the colony was first formed by birds from
the colony which originally existed on Lundy and which was destroyed
by constant persecution from the inhabitants of that island.
In 1886, 250 nests were recorded on Grassholm.
In 1914, 300.
1922--800-1,000 pairs nesting and perhaps 3,000 birds on the
island.
1924--H. M. Salmon and G. C. S. Ingram made a census and
recorded 2,000 nests, an increase of 1,700 nests in ten years. In 1933
they again visited the island and estimated the Gannet population
at 10,000 birds, including at least 1,500 birds in immature plumage
of ages varying from 1 to 4 years. On previous occasions immature
birds had not been noted during the nesting season. The nesting
ground extends for 360 yards in length and local fishermen state
that it increases in breadth at the rate of 15 yards a year.
Salmon and Ingram estimate that the annual increase in nesting
pairs averages 10 per cent. On the occasion of their visit in 1933 the
Gannets were feeding largely on mackerel and the fisherman stated
that the nearest shoals at that time were 50 miles from Grassholm.
This gives some indication of the great area over which the birds
operate when feeding.
Gannets have the habit of regurgitating when disturbed, no doubt
to lighten themselves before taking to the wing for a hurried retreat,
and this habit makes it a simple matter to examine and classify the
food being taken. Examination of the stomach content of these and
other sea-birds reveals that a great number of diseased fish are eaten,
no doubt because they are more easily caught than a healthy and
consequently more active fish. In this way sea-birds assist materially
in preserving healthy shoals and preventing what would otherwise
prove to be a rapid spreading of disease.
It is interesting to note that a young Gannet, ringed at Grassholm,

was recovered off the coast of Morocco, a southerly record for this
species.
Fifty years ago there was also a colony of over J million Puffins on
Grassholm but these birds have now entirely deserted the island
apart from an occasional " resting 55 bird and no satisfactory explana-
tion appears to have been found for this evacuation.
Skomer, a far larger island, some 800 acres in extent and rather
nearer the mainland, now has a Puffin population which is almost
incalculable. One of the most remarkable sights is the assembly of
these quaint little birds at the entrance to their nesting burrows at
sunset every evening. Cormorants are scarce but the Shag nests in
the many caverns round the island.
Fulmars are also to be seen but I am not aware that they nest on
the Island. Manx Sheerwaters and Stormy Petrels are common as
also are Herring, Great Blackback, Lesser Blackback, and Kittiwake
Gulls, and both the Razorbill and Guillemot nest in vast numbers.
Buzzard and Peregrine have old established eyries on the island,
one pair of the latter occupying a most unusual site in the roof of an
old barn.
Ravens, Carrion Crows, and Jackdaws and many of the smaller
birds such as Rock and Meadow Pipits, Wagtails, Chats, and Warblers
are amongst the regular nesting species.
It is noticeable that whilst toads and newts are common in and
near the fresh water springs on the island, the frog appears to be
absent. No doubt the distasteful secretion of the toad has preserved
it from the depredation of the Gulls and Buzzards, whereas I have
frequently seen frogs being eaten by both these species and, in fact,
they appear to be a favourite item of diet to the Buzzard, especially
when feeding young.
In this part of the country Buzzards also bring great numbers of
moles to the nest and also Gull chicks, young Wild Duck in down and,
less frequently, very small rabbits.
In connection with the sea-birds, particular reference must be made
to their specialized colouring and to the fact that the white underparts
of a bird swimming on the surface act as a mirror, reflecting the colour
below them and thus making them almost invisible to fish and other
animal life below the surface of the water.
Also to the importance of " flash " or reflected light, from the sheen
on dark plumage or such white marking as that on the head and beak
of the Razorbill. As pointed out by Dr. Francis Ward in his book
Animal life under Water , this flash, made when a fishing bird dives
beneath the surface of the water, closely resembles the flash caused
by light reflection on the scales of shoaling fish and the fish are therefore
attracted rather than scared away by the close approach of the bird.
No doubt the uneven movement of a sick fish also leaves a trail of

comparative ease with which it could be captured, would account for

BREEDING OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA
PARRAKEETS
(Spathopterus alexandrae)
By Hubert D. Astley

Last year I had the great disappointment of losing the one young
Queen Alexandra that was hatched, owing to a murderous onslaught

from a male Stanley Parrakeet, at least I suspected him, though the
case was " non-proven This year I hope I have been very much
more successful.
In April all three pairs were nesting, and one hen laid at least ten
eggs, but not in a desirable nesting-box, so that the eggs were rolled
about, some were cracked, and the rest did not hatch out, for the bird
was fidgety. This was what I call Pair No. 3. They are now nesting
again (3rd of June).
Pair No. 2 were also unsuccessful, for the hen chose too deep a box,
and consequently jumped down on to the eggs, broke one or two--
she had five--and the yolk stuck to her feathers, so that the other
eggs were spoilt. She is now nesting again.
Pair No. 1. Well ! Bravo Pair No. 1 ! ! They selected what I am
convinced is the most desirable form of nesting-box for Parrakeets,
which I have made at home. Two feet long, with a wooden cup let
into the floor of the box at the farthest end from the entrance hole,
which is at one side. The box is hung horizontally, that is lengthways
on the wall, and the Parrakeets can walk in and settle quietly on their
eggs, feeling secure in the dark corner where the depression is made.
A nice handful or two of rotten wood is put in, and on this the eggs
are laid. The wooden cup is below the level of the floor, and at the
other end a door is made, so that if necessary one can look in, besides
which it facilitates cleaning out the box when the young have flown.
Well ! Pair No. 1 took possession of such a box, which was one hung
in a dark corner of a roosting house, about ten feet up on the wall. The
hen laid her eggs in April, and as with Nos. 2 and 3, the male was
constantly seen to feed her and to mate ; the feeding always taking
place first.

H. D. ASTLEY--BREEDING OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA PARRAKEETS I I I
In the beginning of May the hen kept so closely on her eggs that
I began to wonder whether she was alive, so quiet and silent was
everything within ; which terrible thought impelled me to mount
a ladder to look in the box. As I did so, out she scurried, looking as
fresh as paint. As I was up, I thought I would have a peep, opened
the door, and there at the farther end, lying in the nest of rotten wood-
chips, which had been bitten up very finely, were seven eggs. I hurried
down and left the birds to their own arrangements. On the 12th of
May, young ones were heard making their scraping raucous call when
they were fed, and the male bird took to going into the nest as well
as his wife. The noise of the young ones might have been produced
by at least five, so that I was full of great hopes.
The male is extraordinarily tame, and directly I go in to his apart-
ment, he settles either on one of my arms, or shoulders, or my head,
and will devour mealworms, biting off their heads and squeezing out
their insides ! Then he chucks away the skin and greedily demands
another.
On one of the last days in May, I again looked in, as the hen bird
hardly ever appeared, and to my joy found two fine young birds,
although I was a little disappointed that five of the eggs were un-
hatched. However, the two were really very fine and large, and
completely feathered, looking like their mother in colour, but more
washed out.
On the 3rd of June, the old birds were again seen in the act of
mating, and the hen began to throw some of the refuse out of the
nesting-box, so that I deemed it advisable to remove the young birds,
which were still unable to fly, to a big open box with an inch of sawdust at
the bottom, and, put them quite low down, so that they would not be
injured by falling, for I had visions of their being turned out by their
mother and tumbling down ten feet on to a hard cement floor. When
I took the young ones out, the male bird fussed round in a great stew,
so that I felt confident that he would continue to feed them, although
they would not be so very long before they fed themselves.
The parent birds have had an abundance of fresh grass seeds,
dandelion leaves, etc., as well as gentles and biscuit sop, and if they are
as proud of their young ones as I am, they must be very cock-a-hoop
birds indeed. I have striven for nine years to breed these* beautiful
Parrakeets (Rose-throated Parrakeets as I like to call them !) and
I hope I have at last succeeded.
If these young ones reach full maturity, they will be the first to do
so outside Australia, as far as I know, but I do not think there is much
doubt about it.

The two nestlings left the box on the 6th of June, when they were
probably nearly five weeks old. They can now feed off biscuit sop
when it is held in front of them (gth June).
Their colouring resembles the adult female, except that the forehead
is a mauve pink instead of pale blue, and the ceres are pale yellow.
The rose-coloured throats are quite as brilliant as in the adult bird.
The parents are busy preparing for a second brood.

On the 12th of June I removed the young birds to a cage in the
house ; as it was evident that, although they did not yet crack seeds,
they could eat by themselves. For two days they were rather shy ;
but when hungry, would greedily devour biscuit sop from a spoon. By
the 15th they were quite tame, and when let out of the cage would fly
about the room, or perch on my hand rapidly fluttering their wings
for exercise, calling loudly at the same time.
One of them, if I offered him sop when he did not want it, would
impulsively peck at my hand, plainly saying ## take the stuff away ".
If they had been hatched in a wild state, they could not be better
grown or more robust.

This delicately coloured Parrakeet was discovered by F. G. Water-
house in 1862, during the Sturt Expedition into the interior of
Australia. Specimens were sent to John Gould and in the following
year he described it and named it Polytelis alexandra ## in honour of
that Princess who, we may reasonably hope, is destined at some
future time to be the Queen of these realms and their dependencies,
of which Australia is by no means the most inconspicuous ".
Nothing further was heard of the species until 1890, when two living
birds arrived in Adelaide, having been taken from the nest by Alex
Magarey. A few further specimens were obtained and then in 1894,
the Horn Expedition to Central Australia collected a series including
a fine adult male. Examination of this bird led A. J. North to record
in The Ibis , 1895, 339 * " Generic Characters : Similar to that of the
genus Polytelis , except in having the end of the third primary of each
wing singularly elongated and terminating in a spatule." And this
feature was sufficient in the view of North to warrant removal from
the genus Polytelis and the formation of a genus of its own, Spathopterus .
Astley was wont to ridicule museum workers who make new species

and genera on such flimsy grounds, and insisted that the proper place
for alexandm was with barrabandi (now swainsonii) and melanura (now
anthopeplus) in the genus Polytelis. His reaction when Gregory Mathews
discovered that Spathopterus was preoccupied and considered it necessary
to create another generic name, Northipsitta , may be easily imagined !
The Horn Expedition also obtained living examples, as did Winnecke
in 1895. And it may well be that the single bird deposited at the
London Zoo, nth July, 1895, was from one of these sources. This
bird was definitely the first live-arrival in Europe. The Zoological
Society shortly after obtained a second bird, and one of these survived
for several years.
The first Queen Alexandras to be owned by a member of the
Avicultural Society was a pair obtained by H. J. Fulljames in 1898.
The male did not long survive importation and the female required
considerable attention. She eventually completely recovered and
was exhibited at the Crystal Palace Show, 1900. There is a coloured
plate of this pair by Smit in Avicultural Magazine, 1899, 168.
In 1904, Mrs. St. Clair Christophers presented a further bird to the
Zoo, and W. Fasey secured a pair. These latter birds had a clutch of
four eggs, but Fasey removed them. Astley procured his first pair in
1905, and in the following year the hen produced three clutches of
eggs--all infertile. In 1910, he was able to obtain several more birds,
and in 1911 his stock consisted of two males and five females, four of
which laid that year. After his 1912 success, previously described,
Astley had nothing to record until 1918, when a clutch of six eggs was
hatched, five young ones eventually leaving the nest. He then con-
tinued to be successful during succeeding years.
A good many have been bred by others since, quite a few, I believe,
from descendants of Astley's birds.
The most consistent breeder has undoubtedly been our President.
In 1931, a pair of imported birds reared a nest of four, and young ones
have since been reared at Foxwarren almost annually. In 1939, the
aviaries contained fourteen birds, all of which, with the exception
of the original pair, were home-bred.
Amongst other members to be successful with this species during
recent years are W. L. Eaves, H. J. Indge, C. P. Phillips, E. N. T.
Vane, Holmes Watkins, and Mrs. Effie Clark--the latter reared no
less than nineteen, including a nest of six, during 1947, undoubtedly
a record for a private aviculturist. Keston have also bred quite a
number and have successfully used Redrumps and Rock Pebblers as
foster-parents.
The Psittacine Registry shows that at the end of last year there
were sixty-nine Queen Alexandras in Great Britain, and it is con-
fidently anticipated that this number will have increased considerably
by the time the present breeding season is over.

My first visit to the Antwerp Zoo after the war was on a grey
November day in 1946. Being so near to the station the Zoo had
suffered great damage, for in addition to other bombs in the neighbour-
hood, a flying bomb had fallen on the railway. The lion house had
been badly damaged, the winter garden was a wreck, the monkey house
had been damaged, and the bird and antelope houses destroyed. The
whole place looked sad, shabby, and dilapidated. Many of the mammals
and birds were dead, but the birds of prey had all survived as they had
been kept alive on rats. In spite of all this destruction, however, a new
start had been made, the aquarium was in good shape, and a certain
number of mammals had been received from the Congo. The few
Parrots and other birds remaining were housed with the reptiles above
the aquarium, but I was told of the plans for a new bird house on com-
pletely modern lines.
When I next visited the Zoo on a brilliantly sunny day in May,
1948, the gardens were bright with flowers and new paint, the plans of
1946 had become a reality, and the new bird house was complete. This
is a large building in the centre of the gardens, flanked by exterior
aviaries. The wire netting of these aviaries is of a new design manu-
factured in Switzerland, which in no way obscures the/view, and in fact
is almost invisible. It is made of a very fine stainless wire of about \ inch,
wide mesh, tightly strung after the method of a tennis racquet, and
stretched on steel frames. The effect is most remarkable, and
though costly (the amount used for* the eight outside aviaries shown
in the plate cost approximately #500), it is a cost which is more than
justified (see Fig. 1).
In the interior of the bird pavilion is a series of warmed halls with
brightly lighted side aviaries, the tops of all of which are of glass ;
various areas of the main roof are also of glass, but the light is con-
centrated on the birds. The front of the aviaries is also glass, and they
are so arranged that they can be divided into one, two, or three
sections by partitions made of vertical wires, thus not obscuring the
view of the whole (see Fig. 2). The roofs of the aviaries are also of
sloping wire frames. Each aviary has a ventilator at the base of the
dividing wall and in each are three shallow drinking pans with
running water which can be controlled by a tap outside the back of
the compartment. In this way, when the aviary is divided into three,
each section contains a drinking pan. The only drawback to these
aviaries is that the birds damage their tails by constantly climbing up
and down their wire partitions and rubbing their feathers between the
wires.

The cleaning arrangements are excellent--the whole of the pane of
glass in front of the compartment can be let down on a hinge, a wooden
shutter being pulled down before the glass is lowered in order to keep
the birds from escaping or being frightened (see Fig. 3).
Behind the aviaries is a passage into which a door at the back of the
aviaries opens. By means of this door the aviaries can be easily cleaned
and food given (see Figs. 4 and 5).
In addition to the series of side aviaries are some larger com-
partments planted with shrubs and flowers, the compartment housing
the Little Egrets being particularly beautiful (see Fig. 6). The
Kookaburras also have a most attractive compartment provided with
bright flowers, and this is destined for the Humming Birds when they
arrive. There is a comprehensive collection of indigenous birds, all
in very good condition, and the collection of Parrots is particularly
interesting, including the rare Brazilian Yellow Parrot or Golden

At one end of the main hall is a door leading into a dark gallery with
a series of brightly lighted compartments. No glass or wire-netting is
used to keep the birds in their compartments, but there is a barrier to
keep the public from the birds ! The birds are at complete liberty and
make no effort to leave their so-called cages. I think it is best to quote

a translation of the Director, Mr. Walter Van den bergh's own account
of how he achieved this most interesting experiment (which was pub-
lished in an article in Aviornis, April, 1948).

" It being an established fact that :--
" A diurnal bird released at night in a dark enclosure to which it
is strange often kills itself by hitting against the sides.
" In the wild the small carnivores and reptiles succeed in capturing
diurnal birds easily at night.
" It is logic to conclude that the vision of a diurnal bird is very
limited at night, that darkness immobilizes it, and it is not tempted to
plunge into darkness if it is not compelled to do so by physiological or
biological needs.
" If we therefore apply the principle of displaying fish such as is
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.8147590625" page_id="56311540"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
practised in the large aquariums, that is to say to create an area of
darkness on the public side and increase the lighting of the cage, it is
highly probable that by instinct the bird will not risk plunging into the
darkness, which allows us to do away with all barriers between the
public and the subject shown.
" On 26th October, 1945, the problem to be solved was submitted
to the chief of works, the electrician, and the Head Keeper of birds.
" On 30th October our keeper arranged in the cellar of the old,
damaged building a cage of 1 * 20 by 1 * 20 metres, made of celotex
1 metre above the ground and with one side open.
" The daylight strip-lighting was not then on the market and we
had to content ourselves with shop-window lights, forming a frame of
light round the opening to the interior of the cage.
The roof had been left detachable in order to allow eventually for
supplementary lighting. The interior of the cage was coloured
cinnamon.
" The first attempt was made on the 2nd November, 1945, with a
Song Thrush (Turdus musicus musicus) but three days afterwards we
found footprints on the floor of the cellar which we had covered with
sand.
" The walls of the cellar were white-washed so I had them painted
in a dark, dull colour in order to make the darkness more intense.
" This time the result was conclusive. The bird did not again
venture outside its cage and also did not show the least alarm when we
walked in front of the open side of the cage at a distance of about
a metre.
" On 9th November the cage was decorated with flowers in order to
give it the appearance of more natural surroundings.
" The attempt was repeated with Green-winged Glossy Starlings
(.Lamprocolius chloropterus) which remained from 14th to 22nd November.
The experiment was then considered to have succeeded completely.
The method was then legally notified and registered in January, 1946.

" Meanwhile we had begun attempts at lighting the cage by a com-
bination of day and artificial light, but these attempts were not con-
clusive.
" Actually, the attempts depended, above all, on the colours used
and the physiological and biological effect of the artificial light on the
specimen. The wall of the back of the cage was rounded off in such
a way as to have no corners and to form a whole with the sides. This
created an illusion of infinity. This experiment has also proved that all
decoration detracted from the aestheticness of the whole and that
neutral colours must be used.
" As the tests had been carried out in a cage, but were to be realized
in a gallery with a series of twelve cages, the fact that too much light
might penetrate into the gallery had to be borne in mind. This danger
was additionally greater as the tests had always been carried out with
an intensity of light of i oo watts, whereas for technical reasons we have
been obliged to illuminate the birds with 130 watts.
" In point of fact the test fortunately proved to be successful and
there is sufficient light in the public gangway, but it is not so much as
to induce the birds to leave their enclosures."
The results of Mr. Walter Van den bergh's experiments are certainly
most attractive and interesting and show the birds to their best
advantage (see Figs. 7 and 8).
This system also affords an interesting means for studying bird
psychology. The species in the compartments at the time of my visit
included the following : Green-winged Glossy Starlings ( Lamprocolius
chloropterus) , Chinese Grackle ( Gracula sinensis :), Collared Turtle Doves
(Streptopelia risoria) , Ghopi Grackle ( Gnorimopsar chopi ), $ Alexandrine
Parrakeet ( Psittacula nipalensis ), Green Glossy Starling (. Lamprocolius
chalybeus ), Indian Jungle Myna ( AEthiopsar fuscus ), Cockatiels {Leptolo-
phus hollandicus) , Yellow headed Gonure (Aratinga jendaya ), Indian
Green-winged Doves ( Chalcophaps indica), Rose-coloured Pastor ( Pastor
roseus). Only one bird, a Jay, proved too bold and left its cage. Though
at present there is a single bird, the aim in view is to have a pair in
each compartment representing 12 different families.
At one side of the building is a well arranged kitchen, with adequate
washing facilities, with racks above the sinks for the dishes to drain,
ample food storage accommodation, and cans with funnels for the
seed.
Above the main halls is a light, airy room with a series of aviaries for
extra stocks and breeding. An easy and novel institution for Zebra
Finches nesting-boxes is an inverted flower-pot fixed to a board,
thus enabling the birds to use the hole at the bottom of the pot for
an entrance.
A large number of the original outside aviaries remain and in some
of these a good collection of Pheasants is placed, including the following

The Council of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp and the
Director, Mr. Walter Van den bergh, are to be warmly congratulated
on their great achievement, and though Belgium is for the moment a
forbidden land for the majority of British aviculturists, it is hoped that
before long this ban will be lifted and that many will be able to visit
the Antwerp Zoo and see the new bird pavilion for themselves.

LEBANESE INTERLUDE
By Derek Goodwin

<bodyText confidence="0.99822988" page_id="56311544"  page_num="118" year="" vol="">
For some weeks before my leave was due I had racked my brains,
such as they are, to decide between leave camps in Palestine or the
Lebanon. The presence or otherwise of birds not commonly found
in Lower Egypt was my chief consideration ; but apart from accounts
of Eagles, which judging from the descriptions given must have been
the direct and by no means decadent descendants of the Roc that
carried off Sindbad the sailor, I could gather little information from
those of my comrades who had been in either place. Finally, I fear
for no better reason than that it was farther away and that which is
most remote seems ever most desirable, I decided on the Lebanon.
Once passed through the Sinai desert and the train grunting its
slow progress through Palestine, the changed character of the bird-
life, or at least such of it as could be seen from the windows, soon
became apparent. Kites and Hooded Crows, although common,
were neither so numerous or so familiar as in Egypt ; the larger
Collared Turtle-dove replaced the Palm-dove (which in Palestine
would appear to be more strictly a town bird than in Egypt), and
every second hedge was alive with Goldfinches. Other birds much
in evidence were Skylarks, Crested Larks, Quails, and Lesser Kestrels,
the cocks of the last-named species appearing extremely bright--
almost blue and orange---perhaps their rich colours being magnified
by eyes attuned to the swarthy Egyptian Kestrel. The Quails I suppose
were on migration and must have been present in great numbers
judging by the number of pairs seen to take flight, since it is fairly
certain that there must have been many more birds on the ground

that-did not take fright at the train's passing. At Haifa station the
sight of about thirty Egyptian Vultures fairly took my breath away,
since this bird, despite its name, is by no means abundant in the
Nile delta ; although if any spot at the desert edge can be baited up
for a few days with large bones or other non-portable food an odd
Vulture will sooner or later be attracted by the congregated Kites
and come down to investigate. This bird incidently has not the
repulsive appearance of the large vultures as its neck is fully feathered
and the bare facial skin of an attractive golden yellow hue. The white
parts of its plumage, seen close at hand, are tinged with dusky fawn,
but when seen as it usually is, soaring in brilliant sunlight, it is a thing
of jet and ivory, a spotless vision moving with ineffable grace against
the blue background of sky.
From Haifa the journey continued by truck and as I had the mis-
fortune to be hemmed in the depths of the vehicle with a score or so
of vile bodies between me and the light of day there was not even the
occasional sight of a bird to relieve the monotony. It was dark when
I arrived at the leave camp, which was on sandy ground adjacent
to the shore about four miles south of Beirut. Next morning the first
sound I heard on awaking was the vibrant croaking of Ravens. They
were, to my surprise, the common camp scavengers, taking the place
of the Kite (Milvus migrans agyptius) and Hooded Crow in Egypt,
although much more timid than either of those birds there and doing
most of their gleaning at dawn when few people were about. This race
of Raven (Corvus corax laurencei ) shows much brown on head and neck
at times ; as none of those that I examined through field-glasses
showed the least trace of this I imagine that it is in all probability
the result of bleaching by the hot summer sun and probably affects
different individuals to a different degree, just as a small percentage
of Egyptian Hooded Crows show primaries and secondaries bleached
to a chocolate brown in late spring whereas the majority only fade
to a dull or slightly rusty black.
The first inkling I got that the bird situation was not all it might
be was when a pair of reddish brown Crested Larks fled away at my
approach. In Libya and Egypt I had known this bird as one of
innumerable races, differing in plumage, but all with the constant
factor of friendly indifference towards mankind, so that I felt rather
as one who has stretched out a hand to a friend only to have it struck
away. The reason was soon apparent, as in the course of the day
I passed at least a dozen individuals with shot-guns who were potting
at every bird, large or small, that exposed itself. After wandering
through a most picturesque Armenian village where the only birds
much in evidence were Graceful Warblers and the omnipresent

wary and self-effacing as the last old cock Pheasant in .a non-preserved
wood. Pushing on farther into higher ground I came at length to
a small river, and on descending to its banks saw many White and
Grey Wagtails in full breeding plumage. Since I could see no evidences
of their holding territory I am inclined to think that they were on
migration, but this a mere surmise since I did not observe them
sufficiently long or closely to form a valid opinion.
The following day I visited Beirut. On every hand one heard the
singing of caged Goldfinches, and it was pleasing to see that some of
the cages were of reasonable size and their occupants in quite good
condition. Palm Doves (Stigmatopelia senegalensis) were to be seen
everywhere about the roof-tops, their soft cooing laughter sounding
through the din of traffic in the streets below. I counted seventy-five
that afternoon in one large tree in the main square, but to my surprise
never saw a single bird on or near the ground ; in striking contrast
to its behaviour in Cairo where it not only forages in every garden
and open space, but is frequently seen walking about in the less
congested streets. How the Beirut birds got their living I do not know,
but since I never saw them even in the outskirts of the town, far less
in the surrounding countryside, I imagine they must have been fed
on the roof-tops by charitable people. In the narrower streets and
bazaars Swallows were very much in evidence, evidently nesting
inside inhabited buildings after their usual manner in the Near East.
In the bazaar I found a bird-shop. The stock consisted of a beautiful
pair of Chukor Partridges in a parrot cage and several dozen fancy
Pigeons packed like sardines in rough cages about 4 feet square.
Among them were some lovely little Rock-doves, which being too
cowed by their imprisonment to think of fighting back, were having
a rough time at the hands, or rather beaks, of their companions in
sorrow. Rock-Doves are birds I have long coveted but never possessed.
At one time one gathers that tame Pigeons of similar type to the wild
birds could be purchased for a mere song from any farm dovecote,
but now in England even the feral Pigeons in most places show more
resemblance to Racing Homers (from which they largely originate)
and " blue rocks 55 are not to be had for love&amp;apos; nor money. It was,
however, out of the question to purchase any of those in the bazaar,
particularly as having had their primaries and secondaries plucked out
(the treatment invariably accorded to wild birds in the Near East
on capture, and although cruel, less so in my opinion than the pinioning
of adult birds which is often practised in this country) it would have
been impossible to turn them loose, had the need arisen, with any
hope of their surviving.
On the morning of the 7th I saw a most striking aerial display by
a pair of Ravens above a wood of small conifers where I was standing.
The cock (?) was chasing the hen (?) low over the tree-tops : he kept

uttering a rapid excited " Ka kar kar kar ", as he gained on the hen
she would utter two odd musical little notes, a sort of " kok kok "
deep and yet metallic, suggestive of a small gong being quickly struck
twice, and as he overtook her would fling over backwards and thrust
up her feet like a Kite, sometimes slipping to one side, but more often
turning a complete somersault and then flying on in the same direction.
I feel tolerably certain that the birds were paired and the affair was
not hostile as the pursued kept doubling about in the same area and
the pursuer made no real attempts to get to grips with it, and when
eventually the birds saw me directly beneath them and scattered in
panic, the " chasee " circled back to join the other and they flew
away together.
Later in the morning I found a most delightful spot where a small
river joined the sea, and between the shore and the extensive olive
orchards behind was an area of rough grass and bushes dotted with
pools and suggestive of some English meadow, but for the fact that
clumps of date-palms replaced the traditional elms. Over the largest
pool scores of Swallows skimmed to and fro drinking and bathing,
whilst others perched to dry and preen on the bush-tops, their soft
warbling forming a pleasant background to the harsh croaking of
frogs and sudden fluting song-snatches of Yellow-vented Bulbuls.
There is something particularly appealing about the song of the
Swallow, disjointed and inconsequential as it is, it yet contrives to
suggest something ineffably pure and tender. Listening to it one can
well understand how irresistible must have been the charms of the
young lady in the Canterbury Tales who :--
" . . . sang as soft and yerne
As doth a swalwe sitting on a berne."
Besides the Swallows there were numbers of very greyish-looking
Willow Warblers, presumably of the Siberian race, several parties of
Goldfinches, Graceful Warblers, and Yellow-vented Bulbuls that were
obviously resident, a cock Stonechat, all by himself so no doubt on
his travels since in its winter quarters this bird is almost always to be
seen in pairs (at least this is the case with those that winter in Egypt,
Malta, and Eastern Libya), and a cock Redstart. The pools inci-
dentally were full of edible frogs and water-tortoises with snaky olive
and yellow striped heads, whilst about the banks were innumerable
tree-frogs of a bright and delicate green. Butterflies were much in
evidence--Walls, Brimstones, Red Admirals, Clouded Yellows, and,
of course, the Painted Lady, omnipresent as its human namesake,
though rather more attractive.
Coming back along the shore I saw several parties of Kentish
Plovers and four Geoffroy's Sand Plovers. At one point a great mass
of flotsam and jetsam had piled up, and here sixty-four Ravens,

about half as many Herring Gulls, and three pariah dogs were
scavenging. To my surprise the latter made no attempt to molest
the birds and the Gulls and Ravens hardly bothered to move out of
their way and showed not the slightest sign of fear, or even interest,
when they approached. I visited this area on subsequent occasions,
but apart from the fluctuating numbers of the migrant birds saw
nothing new except a Pied Kingfisher, the only one I saw at all in
the Lebanon.
Twice, with ulterior motives, I joined skiing expeditions into the
hills. House Sparrows were, to my surprise, very numerous even
about isolated buildings right up in the snow-covered mountains.
Hooded Grows were also very plentiful, and there were fair numbers
of Ravens and Lesser Kestrels. One wondered what the birds managed
to find to eat, and why they did not descend out of the snow and ice
and biting winds into the sun-drenched valleys below that showed so
clearly whenever the mists cleared for a little.
On the 11 th, wandering through the vast olive orchards along the
bank of the river, I suddenly heard the raucous alarm notes of the
bird that I like above all others ; it was over four years since I had
last seen a Jay, so those readers who also suffer from " bird-fever 55
will well imagine how excited I felt at the prospect of doing so again.
This was, however, no easy matter and half an hour's crawling
among the riverside brambles achieved nothing more than a few odd
glimpses of bright wings and snowy rumps, instantly lost again among
the grey green foliage. I then noticed a tree that rose high above its
neighbours--it was not an olive, but I fear I have no idea of its species--
and was moreover very densely foliaged, so I climbed into it, settled
myself as comfortably as possible, and waited. No doubt some of the
Jays had seen me take up my position, at all events, although there
were numbers flying about near at hand, either through chance or
design, they never alighted where I could get a reasonable view of
them. After some four hours, however, one suddenly hopped up
on to the top of an olive tree only about 50 yards away, where for
some twenty minutes it rested quietly and I had a splendid view of it.
Then some Jays came flying into my tree from behind, spotted me,
and at once sheered off in a great fright and proceeded to make the
air ring with their noisy alarm. The bird I was watching snapped out
of its reverie at once, looked about anxiously--paying particular
attention to the ground round about--then, seeing nothing, evidently
decided to join its comrades and find out the cause of the commotion,
flew straight towards me, lit on a branch immediately above my head
and hardly 6 feet away, and after a moment flew off again without
having seen me. I can only suppose that the bird was confident
that the danger could not be so near and that all its attention was
centred on the birds it could see and hear only a little way away.

Even so it is the only time I have ever known a Jay to be caught
napping in such a manner. These birds were of the Syrian form
(Garrulus glandarius atricapillus) which differs from the common bird
in having more white about the head and a glossy black crown and
nape.
In camp I made the acquaintance of a tame Yellow-vented Bulbul
that belonged to one of the camp staff. This bird was allowed full
liberty and was absolutely fearless, although its plumage was in a
rather deplorable state. I learnt from the owner that the bird not only
accompanied him to the mess and shared his meals, but was nightly
regaled with cake and beer in the N.A.A.F.I. After which information
I was only surprised at the continued liveliness and good spirits of
the feathered toper. I can never understand why most people find it
so vastly amusing to tempt or even coerce birds and mammals into
taking intoxicants and other unnatural forms of food, but no doubt
I have a warped sense of humour.
All too soon my leave came to an end, but on the train journey back
I had brief but exceedingly close views of a Marsh Harrier perched
at the side of the track--the only time I have ever"seen any species of
Harrier other than on the wing, and a cock Red-legged Kestrel that
flew from a rockface only a few yards away, and when I saw a Rock
Dove dive from the sky into a small and obviously " get-at-able "-
cave I felt half-inclined to risk jumping from the window to investigate.

For many members of the Avicultural Society the supreme test of
the English climate is its behaviour on the day of the President's
garden party, and the 1948 gathering will be remembered as one
when an unanimous award of full marks could be made to the clerk
of the weather for wearing his most benign smile. A motor coach was
kindly provided by Mr. Ezra for those travelling from London, whilst
others joined the party at the park, whose beauties could be enjoyed
in the most favourable conditions possible.
After a welcome from our President and Hon. Secretary, the guests
were conducted to a paddock containing a pair of the beautiful and
rare White-necked Crane, whose two well-grown young ones inspired
great admiration. Thence the visitors proceeded to the main aviaries,

R. G. WITTING-THE PRESIDENT'S GARDEN PARTY
in which, despite some expressions of sadness at their relative depopula-
tion as compared with the ornithological riches they contained in
earlier years, many birds of great interest were inspected--Leadbeater's
Cockatoos, Queen Alexandra's and Green-winged King Parrakeets,
an albino Crow, Jackson's Whydah-Bird, Rothschild's Grackle,
Bronze-winged Pigeons, Superb Glossy and Rosy Starlings, a cock
Amherst Pheasant, and a trio of Mikados, whilst a Pekin Robin,
flitting from bush to bush, evoked some expressions of nostalgia for
the dear distant days when some may have been mistakenly inclined
to despise this charming species asa" common " bird. It was gratifying
to find that the strain of lutino Ring-necked Parrakeets is represented
by numerous individuals.
The company was next conducted to the waterfowl ponds, having
on the way an opportunity of admiring the saltatory feats of a herd of
Blackbuck, with their young, and of numerous Wallabies, including
a mother with a young one in her pouch. Those who have only seen
either of these creatures in small paddocks can form but a small idea
of their grace of movement when they are permitted a large space in
which to disport themselves. At Foxwarren they are surely viewed
under conditions as nearly approaching perfection as is possible,
enjoying, as they do, together with a number of the small Indian
deer known as Muntjacs, the freedom of a large part of the park,
with hills, dales, and woods, all surrounded by a vermin-proof fence.
This digression, in view of its unique interest, may be pardoned in
a magazine devoted to birds.
Passing from fur to feather, the company next turned their attention
to the waterfowl, amongst which Eyton's Tree-Ducks, Scaup, and
full-winged Mandarins and Carolinas were especially noticed, and
the fact of eclipse plumage being the rule at this time of the year did
little to lessen their attraction. A Blue Eared Pheasant and some
Jungle Fowl were also displaying themselves in the vicinity.
An adjournment was now made to the house for tea, and it is
typical of our host's kindness and consideration that, observing the
attention of some of the party to be drawn by cages at an upper
window, he immediately invited his guests to go upstairs and examine
the occupants. These proved to be some of the most fascinating birds
seen that day, amongst them being a couple of Golden-fronted Fruit-
Suckers, a glorious Shama, and two Sun-Birds whose metallic plumage
scintillated with a marvellous iridescence in the June sunshine. It
was interesting to learn that it had been necessary to protect the
windows with wire-netting, because on one occasion a Sparrow Hawk
had had the boldness to penetrate right into the room in its search
for feathered prey. The numerous objects of interest in this part of
the house included a number of paintings of past favourite occupants
of the aviaries, amongst which White-and-Blue Kingfishers, Renauld's

Ground-Cuckoos, Rothschild's Grackles, Glittering Pheasants, Pink-
headed Ducks, and the famous blue Alexandrine Parrakeet were
conspicuous, whilst at the head of the stairs a superb tapestry depicting
Paradise Flycatchers was much admired.
After tea some of the party explored the beautiful garden in front
of the house, whilst others enjoyed the extensive panorama from the
terrace and listened to Miss Ruth Ezra's pianoforte playing.
It is difficult to exaggerate the debt which the members of the
Avicultural Society owe to Mr. and Mrs. Ezra and their family for
the care and trouble which they lavish in making these gatherings
occasions of the utmost pleasure to their guests!

The Chairman stated that the dinner, in honour of Mr. Lee
Crandall and Mr. Freeman Shelly, was a very special one for the
British Aviculturists' Club as it was an endeavour to express the
gratitude of the aviculturists in Great Britain to their colleagues in
the United States and their admiration for the whole great American
nation. They had tried to make the evening a symbol of this and
had in consequence chosen for the souvenir menu a bird not very
typical of aviculture, the Bald Eagle, the emblem of the United States.
No one had as yet qualified for the Society's medal for breeding this
bird in captivity though it had been bred at Buffalo, New York, in
1909. She thanked Mr. G. Clark for kindly specially executing and
presenting the drawing. Miss Barclay-Smith said she was very glad
that Dr. William Mann, Director General of the Washington Zoo,
and Mrs. Mann had also come to England and the Club was greatly
honoured by their presence. The Club had, in addition, a number of
distinguished guests from Great Britain, the Director, and the Keeper
of Zoology, of the British Museum (Natural History), the President
of the British Ornithologists' Union, and representatives of the British
Council and the British Ornithologists' Club. She was particularly
glad to welcome Mr. H. G. Calkin, Managing Director of Country Life ,
who had done so much to help the Avicultural Magazine ; it was
entirely owing to the assistance of Mr. Calkin that so many coloured
plates had been possible and she would like to take this opportunity
of expressing the gratitude of the Society to him. Mr. Calkin was
retiring after 47 years with Country Life and in wishing him every
happiness Miss Barclay-Smith told him that in his retirement he was
by no means going to be allowed to lose touch with the Avicultural
Society.
The Chairman stated that the indefatigable Hon. Secretary, Mr.
Prestwich, had always gone in for quality in his collections but he had
surpassed himself this evening in the valuable collection of Zoo
officials he had gathered together, representative of the Zoological

Miss Barclay-Smith then paid a tribute to the work of Mr. Delacour,
who was doing so much to bring the aviculturists of the Old and
New Worlds together. He was greatly missed in Europe but she
hoped he would retain his migratory instinct which impelled him
eastwards each summer.
Mr. Shelly, Miss Barclay-Smith explained, was visiting Europe for
the first time; and they were greatly honoured and gratified that
within two hours of arriving in London he should be with the British
Aviculturists' Club. Miss Barclay-Smith then concluded with the
following words - of thanks to Mr. Lee Crandall : " It is difficult to
express to you, Mr. Crandall, just how much we feel and how much
we wish to thank you for all you have done. During the war, when
Mr. Ezra was being peppered with bombs of all species, Miss Knobel
was having her windows blown out every other day, and I was living
an unreal life 100 feet below ground helping to produce a secret
aero-engine, you constantly wrote us the most encouraging and
sympathetic letters--we used to send those letters to each other and
when everything seemed so hopeless and difficult and we felt almost
in despair at keeping aviculture going at all, those letters inspired us
and helped us, more than I can tell you, through those hard days.
In addition, you fed us, you fed our birds, and for what I am personally
most grateful, you fed the Avicultural Magazine ; in keeping those
three component parts of the Society alive you helped in no small
measure to keep the Society in being. We are very happy to have
you with us to-night and to be able to express to you, though most
inadequately, our great gratitude for your kindness and help which
we can never forget."
Mr. Lee Crandall, in reply, said he was greatly moved by the
Chairman's words, expressed his thanks to everyone for the kind
welcome he had received, and said he was very pleased to be once
again in England.
He then exhibited a technicolor film of the New York Zoological
Park which he said would give a general idea of an American Zoo,
as the New York Zoo did not differ greatly from any other Zoo in
America.
Shots in the film included those of the Sea Lion pond, the Giant
Panda which arrived in 1941 and weighed 369 pounds, the Penguin
pond, an African Elephant brought from the Congo in 1946,
Tortoises, Beaver dams, the Gibbon island, Otters, the duck pond,
and Zebras galloping in an enclosure called the African plain, and
also the animal hospital.
Remarking on the film, Mr. Crandall said that the idea of the public
feeding the Sea Lions had been copied from the London Zoo, but for

the privilege of feeding them visitors had to pay to the extent of
five cents per mackerel. With the breeding of Black-footed Penguins
the New York Zoo had done very well but had not been successful
with King Penguins. Dr. Mann, however, who is an authority on
King Penguins, has done very well with them.
Speaking of the births in the New York Zoo this year, Mr. Crandall
said there had been two rare births, one of a baby Moose the other
of a baby Gibbon, the latter being born two weeks before he left the
United States for Britain.
Mr. Crandall said mammals of special interest now residing in the
New York Zoo include the Bongo, which had been there for fourteen
years, an Okapi which was received at the same time as the animal
now in the London Zoo, Pere David Deer received two years ago
from the Duke of Bedford, and three Lesser Pandas received from
Calcutta last year. The Pandas had settled down very well although
they are usually very difficult to rear in America.
The New York Zoological Park, or the Bronx Zoo, he said, was
free to the public on four days a week with a small admission fee being
charged on Thursdays. The attendance ran to about three million
a year. Some of the Zoos in America were closed during the winter
as very few people visited them and the expense of keeping them
open was very great. Other American Zoos, such as the St. Louis
Zoo, depended very largely on trained animals for attracting the
public, and St. Louis did a remarkable job in putting on these trained
animals. Mr. Crandall remarked that this did not affect the nature
of the animals in general, and it was not at all a circus Zoo, but the
act was used to draw the public which is necessary for the support of
a Zoo.
Mr. Crandall then exhibited a second film entitled Strangers from
Afar. Many mammals and birds were shown but those of special
interest were Duck-billed Platypuses brought to New York by David
Fleay last year, which, Mr. Crandall said, had settled there very
well, an Echidna, which Mr. Crandall explained was not nearly so
rare or so difficult to keep as the Duck-billed Platypuses, a Water
Opossum, probably the only one kept in captivity, Tarsiers brought
from the Philippines, a Monkey-eating Eagle, a baby Wattled Crane,
which was very rare, and the habits and display of the Umbrella
Bird.
Pictures were also shown of the reconditioned small mammal house
and small bird room, and also of the old small mammal house.
Mr. Crandall said wire netting had now been replaced by glass,
heating and ventilation improved, the animals and birds were doing
better than they did before and they could be seen to a better
advantage ; the cages were more decorative and the smell which
made the small mammal house so unpleasant no longer existed.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith, proposing a vote of thanks to Mr. Lee Crandall,
said : " I think I may claim to have known Mr. Crandall probably
longer than anyone else in this room, for it is not far short of forty
years since he started his work in the New York Zoo, and I became
Curator of Birds in the London Zoo. We had much in common and
used to correspond a good deal. Shortly after his appointment Mr.
Crandall came over here to see us and I recollect the visit very well ;
it was most delightful as we were able to discuss items connected with
our work.
" One incident of this first visit of which Mr. Crandall reminded
me when he was last here, some ten years ago, was the day he bought
an overcoat. He said that he was still wearing it on occasions, nearly
thirty years afterwards. This shows that we were once able to produce
good things in this country, even if we cannot do so now. We could,
also, at that time produce good birds and some good aviculturists,
such as Hubert Astley, Reginald Phillipps, and Mrs. Johnstone, to
look after them. We hope, however, things will improve and we are
very delighted to hear of the good work being done on the other side
of the Atlantic.
" Our Zoo is looking up and we are getting on very well, but,
unfortunately, private individuals are unable to do very much at
present. We all remember, at least those of us who are old enough
to remember, the magnificent collections kept about thirty years
ago. Our friends in the United States have not experienced the
difficulties which we have had to contend with, and they have really
done remarkably well.
" Mr. Crandall went himself to New Guinea and brought back a
most wonderful collection of Birds of Paradise, the best in any zoological
collection in the world, and we were delighted to read about his
experiences there.
" Those of us who are fortunate enough to be members of the New
York Zoological Society and receive its publications, find it very
pleasant to read the articles contributed by Mr. Crandall.
" We have to-night had a grand show and it was most interesting
to learn about the habits and display of the Umbrella Bird.
" We do congratulate Mr. Crandall for what he has accomplished,
also our other friends in the United States, and I am sure we all wish
to extend our heartfelt thanks to Mr. Crandall for the delightful
show he has given us this evening."
Miss Knobel, in seconding the vote of thanks, said : " We
have so many distinguished guests with us that it is indeed a gala
night for the Avicultural Society's Club, but especially are we glad
and proud to welcome Mr. Lee Crandall, and feel it is a great honour
to have him with us. Of course, we should have loved him far more
dearly had he brought us a dozen Blue-birds and I don't think we

But I fear all these glories for us are things of the past and we have
to content ourselves with happy memories of the ' might have beens \
" I met Mr. Lee Crandall at the Ornithological Congress, which
met at Oxford in 1934, and I believe I am right in thinking he was
in the same coach as myself when we went to Lord Lilford's place
near Oundle and we had a most perilous journey with a terrible
driver. He either accelerated and bumped us into the coach in front
or jammed on his brakes and the coach behind bumped into us, so
we were continually being thrown backwards and forwards, and he
ended in going round the wrong side of an island and getting into
trouble with the police.
" Well, ladies and gentlemen, as your Club hostess, I am sure
I am speaking for you ' all in again saying how gratified we are to
have Mr. Lee Crandall with us, and I have very great pleasure in
seconding the vote of thanks to him."
Mr. Shelley then spoke : "I should like to thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen, from the bottom of my heart for the kind
welcome you have shown me to-night. I have not been in your
country before and as I said to Miss Barclay-Smith a few moments
ago, I am so happy I was able to see Britain from the air as it gave
me an opportunity of seeing your countryside.
" Like Mr. Crandall, I am immensely touched by your hospitality.
You are a grand bunch. I have many friends in Britain, especially
in Nottingham and Birmingham, and we have had the pleasure in
Philadelphia of entertaining a number of your people many times.
Should any of you come to the States, look us up and we will try and
return the hospitality that you have shown us to-night."
Dr. William Mann then said how pleased he was to be present ;
he had arrived unexpectedly and had not got his name on the menu,
but he was sure he could have had the potatoes named after him !
He had been in London three days and was extremely surprised and
delighted to see the progress that had been made, especially as in the
days of the war he had read in the papers and been told by friends
of the destruction and difficulties the British had had to contend
with ; he was sure their sacrifices had not been in vain and would
go down in zoological history. Dr. Mann then gave an entertaining
account of his experiences with King Penguins, relating how he was
supposed to be the King of keeping King Penguins, but that the last

Coloured Zebra Finches are firmly established in South Africa.
The term " coloured " might not be the correct terminology, but it is
the popular name for the latest mutations which have occurred in the
Australian Zebra Finch in this country.
There are hundreds of cinnamon Zebra Finches and most
aviculturists are breeding them freely. These birds are cinnamon in
colour and genetically adhere to the rule by which cinnamonism is
mostly transmitted to offspring. It is a sex-linked recessive,
characteristic. The young, for the first ten days after hatching, have
characteristic pink eyes which gradually become black. Cinnamons
occur in the white form as well.
The silvers are the most interesting, I think, of the three new colours
that exist in South Africa. Their name describes their colour. The
intensity of their body colour varies as well as the colour of the ear
markings. The body colour varies from almost normal to a whitish
silver and the ear markings vary from almost normal to a light salmon-
pink colour in the lighter shades.
There is, however, an exception in some cases, and in one well-
known fancier's aviary is to be seen a dark silver with completely white
ear markings. The colour is not sex-linked, but automosal in nature,
and silvers are dominant to the wild type of Australian Zebra Finch.
There are white silver Zebra Finches, but they appear as a white bird,
and in order to prove whether or not they are silver, they have to be
test bred. The third, and prettiest colour, is the cream Zebra, which is
a combination of the former two colours. It is a cinnamon silver. It is
a cream coloured cinnamon, the cock having beautiful cinnamon
markings of lighter shade than the ordinary cinnamon for ear
markings and for lacing on the side of the abdomen and chest.
The history of these mutations is an interesting one. Many years
ago, Mr. Frank Mills procured a dark silver cock from the late
Mr. Robert Cleugh, and this bird is the foundation of all the cinnamon,
silvers, and combinations of these colours in South Africa to-day.
Whether the original bird was a carrier of the cinnamon factor or not
will always be a matter of conjecture. However, I am inclined to
believe from the history of the breeding results that it was not a split
cinnamon bird, but that the cinnamon appeared as mutants in
Mr. Mills' aviaries. The first lot of young ones that were bred were
silvers from the original cock bird. These birds were all kept in one
aviary where they freely interbred, and it was not until at least a year
after these birds had been well established that the first cinnamon
hen appeared. From then on both cinnamons and creams were easily

bred. At the present moment I have a Zebra Finch cock which is
almost black. Its wings are darker than the normal wild type bird.
The usual white stripes at the base of the beak are black. The abdomen is
black with a few mottled spots here and there. The bird is fertile and
it has been mated to a normal split white hen, and there are six young
ones almost ready to leave their nest. They appear to be normal in
appearance. When they are mature enough a young hen will be
mated back to the old cock. Other variations of colour have appeared
from time to time. One in particular was attractive enough to be
mentioned. That was a variegated Zebra Finch hen with normal
coloured cap, normal coloured wings, and a white body. Whether or
not the owner is attempting to experiment with this bird is unknown
to me.
It seems a pity to conclude this article without mentioning some of
the activities of aviculturists in South Africa. During the war years we
were particularly lucky. There was never a shortage of the common
seeds, plain canary, the millets, and manna seed. The prices never
really rose above pre-war prices, and the best millet could be bought for
not more than J$s. a 200 lb. bag.
The importation of foreign birds was very much restricted, but most
of the commoner type were always very well represented, e.g. Long-
tailed Grass Finches, both the yellow-billed and the red-billed variety,
were always present in most aviaries. Gouldian Finches, Diamond
Doves, Star Finches, Masked Finches, etc., and all the Mannakin
species are well established.

Kentish woods and commons around Keston and Hayes have
a fascination for me and in early spring are full of interest to lovers of
nature. As the trees and hedgerows begin to display their shades of
green, anemones and bluebells spread their white and blue carpets
while our birds fill the air with joyous mating song. Early May is my
favourite time for the study of wild life in this district, with notebook
and camera much can be recorded by the keen observer, such know-
ledge, self obtained is indeed a lasting pleasure.
Self-preservation in wild bird life has always held an interest for me,
survival of the fittest must be a strong point, but to obtain fitness,
instinct would predominate and in this article I hope readers of our
Magazine will agree with me that it is worth recording just one proof
of instinct being first and foremost for survival. On a recent ramble
at Keston I was admiring a majestic oak just coming into leaf, when at
the base, among dead bracken I noticed small feathers. On closer
examination I discovered bones and fur of small rodents, also the
wings of a Thrush, evidence of a Hawks' feeding place. Both the
Kestrel and Sparrowhawk are known to breed in this locality, the
latter an enemy of our wild birds. I had one glimpse of a handsome
pair high overhead but did not see them come near to the oak that
day. It is generally known that the Sparrowhawk does not kill or
tear up its prey in the vicinity of its nest. When a hen is sitting the
male will bring to a nearby tree its victim, kill and tear it up there to
feed the hen, also the youngsters, flying back and forth for fresh pieces
very quietly and among dense foliage ; no doubt an instinct of self-
preservation. On my next visit a few days later I looked around for
a likely breeding site somewhere near the large oak, and noticed what
looked to be a squirrel's drey in the second fork of ah older oak, about
thirty yards away; this oak had several decayed limbs although its
upper branches were well covered with foliage. Sitting quietly under
cover some distance from the tree I caught brief glimpses of both
Hawks visiting this mass of sticks many times and so formed the idea
they were building or renovating the structure. About a week later
with the aid of field glasses I concluded that the hen was sitting as the
male came at intervals from the large oak to the nesting site. Here
then was a chance to take the eggs and scare away the Hawks, as
in this locality many of our choice softbills live and breed and Hawks
would not be welcome. To bring a ladder would be an arduous task

but how would it be possible to reach the nest with no low branches
to the old oak.
On meditating and looking around I saw two small bluish-grey
birds dart through the leaves and disappear about the base of the
Hawks' nest, and after an interval they fly out again. This performance
was repeated many times and with the aid of the glasses I identified
them as Nuthatches ; surely they would not select a breeding site
so very near such an enemy, or was this an act of instinct for self-
preservation, so near yet so safe ? As I now had a two-fold urge to
investigate I allowed a few more days to pass. On my next visit
I noticed a tall silver birch, which was possible to climb and sway over
to reach an outer branch of the old oak and so work up to the Hawks'
nest. On reaching my point of cover and watching intently for any
movement in the old oak I was interested to spot, by the glasses, two
Tree-creepers deftly fly to the base of this old oak and zig-zag up to
the first branch, then with a downward flight close to the trunk
disappear. Quietly watching, it was seen they returned at intervals
with oddments in their slender pointed bills which I concluded was
nesting materials.
Was this another instance of self-preservation ? Did the Nuthatches
and Creepers know Sparrow-hawks were so close to them ? My next
visit was an adventure of curiosity--to climb the birch and reach
the old oak, first to discover a Tree-creepers nest, then a Nuthatch
above and finally the Hawks. Would all three be hatching and possibly
rearing their respective young in the same tree ? Here indeed was an
interesting situation. Carefully climbing the slender birch, it was
possible at about twenty feet to sway over and grasp a protruding
branch of the oak and pull myself on to a sturdy limb. On gaining
the fork at the trunk I noticed a split in the bark and tucked well into
the crevice was quite a bundle of dried grasses, hair and small feathers ;
carefully feeling among this I discovered two eggs, these were of
a whitish ground colour prettily &amp;apos;splashed with reddish-brown at one
end. Making my way upwards through the now well-covered branches
I had no difficulty in discovering the large, rather untidy nest of the
Sparrowhawks, when just at that moment out flew a Nuthatch close
to my head. This old oak was well suited for breeding sites for such as
Nuthatches and Creepers as an old limb had broken away and left
a cavity partly covered by the base of the Hawks nest, one side of this
cavity was filled in with a very hard substance resembling blackish
clay, leaving just a space for such as a Nuthatch to enter. It was not
possible to see or feel into the opening but possibly eggs were there.
I now looked over the top of quite a bundle of twigs, sticks and dried
leaves ; to make quite sure the Hawks were not at home I certainly
did not approach quietly. My reward was no birds but three eggs very
similar in colour and markings to Nuthatch eggs. It was interesting

to note that all three nests contained eggs with the same ground colour
and markings almost identical, though varying considerably in size.
Putting the three Sparrowhawk eggs into a paper bag and holding
the twisted top in my mouth I began to descend, but in reaching for
the birch I swung a little and broke the eggs, otherwise my venture
ended safely.
On reviewing the situation it was interesting to note all three nesting
sites were on the south-east side, just one above the other, the Nut-
hatches quite screened in their coming and going, while lower down,
hidden by branches, the Creepers zig-zagged to and from their nest
unobserved. I concluded instinct of self-preservation was very evident
in these denizens of our woodlands, as the Hawks were certainly in
residence first and the other two sites were chosen later. Would it be
possible such birdy instinct could discern safety in close proximity
to dodge an enemy, I consider this is so, as small birds continually
flying to and fro from adjacent trees would be more easily seen by
the Hawks than those using sites directly under, where they could not be
seen, when we consider that the male Hawk would be all attention
to the hen when on the nest. My last visit to the old oak was a few
days ago (the last week of May) just three weeks since first seeing the
Hawks building. Through glasses I saw both Creepers continually
about the trunk, evidently foraging to feed their young, also one
Nuthatch darting in and out of the opening higher up under the
Hawks' nest, but there has been no sign of the latter--possibly they
have deserted owing to loss of their eggs.

Reprints of Articles in back numbers of the Magazines.
In view of the fact that early numbers of the Avicultural Magazine are not available
to many members of the Society and also to the great difficulty in obtaining articles
at the present time, (owing to the world shortage of birds in captivity), it has been
decided to reprint a series of articles. These articles will be chosen with a view to
providing information of interest to aviculturists of the present time and will not
deal with birds which are seldom seen in captivity. The first of these articles " Breeding
of Queen Alexandra Parrakeets " by Hubert D. Astley is published in this number.
The Editor will be glad to receive criticisms or comments on this proposal.

By Dr. Maurice Amsler, F.Z.S.
It was indeed a sad moment for the Avicultural Society when our
Hon. Secretary decided to relinquish her post. But it is hardly
necessary to remind members that for the past nine years aviculture
has for various reasons become increasingly difficult, and it was there-
fore thought that a business man would be better able to deal with
the various authorities who control the distribution of food and the
importation of birds. Mr. Prestwich, who has succeeded Miss Knobel
as Hon. Secretary, has our gratitude, and also our very best wishes
for a venture which seethes with difficulties and interference.
It was in 1922 that " Maudie ", as she is known to many of us, was
asked to become temporary Secretary until someone more suitable
could be found ! At that time the Society was in low water and
heavily in debt to the printers. Most of us subscribed #10 to float
the sinking ship, and such was the yeoman service of our temporary
Secretary that we have never since looked back ; neither was anyone
foolish enough to suggest any substitute for her services, which have
now covered a period of twenty-six years. Actually Miss Knobel
has herself proposed over 380 new members, a goodly proportion of
our total number.
Then, at the end of a quarter of a century of service, the Society
gave Miss Knobel a well deserved presentation of a cheque for #252,
to which the New Zealand Avicultural Society added another #5
through the kind agency of Mr. Hutchinson, who asked that " Little
New Zealand " should not be forgotten.
A part of these donations was spent on jewellery--not only a good
investment, but even to a man's eyes a very beautiful and well chosen
set of ornaments.
A gift of a pair of Doves started this little lady on the fascinating
road of aviculture at the tender age of two years ; then followed
a Canary which lived for twenty years, a good proof of the meticulous
care which she has ever since bestowed on her birds and other pets.

The Canary was followed by hand-reared Blackbirds, Thrushes, a
Magpie, and a Rook, but the most remarkable was most certainly
a Sparrow, a species which, although cheeky and fearless in the
wild, does not lend itself well to cage life. This bird learned the
song of the Canary, and when liberated found himself a mate
and reared a family which he brought back to his old cage-home
for food.
Finally, in 1911, the first Parrot, a Blue-fronted Amazon, was pur-
chased, and this started a series of birds of this tribe for which
Miss Knobel has become justly famous. Of the forty-two species of
Amazons, she has kept twenty-seven, and there have of course been
many African Greys, Cockatoos, Parrakeets, Lovebirds, Budgerigars,
and so forth--but one with so catholic tastes could not resist such
charmers as Shamas (no pun intended), tame Bulbuls, small seed-
eaters, Roller Canaries, and a pack of Pekingese.
To clinch her position as an authority on Psittacins, she studied
skins and skeletons at the Natural History Museum and also at Tring.
It was during these investigations that she discovered the sexual
differences in the pelves of Parrots. Actually the ischial tuberosities
are further apart in females than in males, the explanation tendered
being that the larger pelvic outlet in females facilitates the extrusion
of the ovum. Through the courtesy of Mr. Pocock these studies
were continued and verified at the prosectorium at the Zoo.
Although we of the Council will no longer listen to Miss Knobel's
admirable minutes, and her clear expositions of our finance she, of
course, remains on that Council, and in the absence of our President
we shall doubtless see her in the Chair, for she has most deservedly
been elected a Vice-President.

Reprinted from the Avicultural Magazine 1926: August, p. 203; September , p. 223.
The family of Amazon Parrots is a fairly large one, comprising some
forty-two or more known species. With the exception of one, Guildings,
they are mostly green in colour, with other brilliant hues, such as red,
blue, and yellow, on the head, wings, tail, etc.
They come from Mexico, the southern parts of North America,
Central America, South America, as far down as Brazil and some of
the adjacent islands.
They vary very much in size, some measuring not more than
8 inches, while others may be as big as 21 inches. Individuals of the

<bodyText confidence="0.9505864" page_id="56311573"  page_num="139" year="" vol="">
same species sometimes vary considerably in size, due probably to
locality.
Many are well known, like the Blue-fronted, and are imported in
hundreds, or even thousands, every year, to find homes amongst both
rich and poor in England and the Continent. Others are extremely
rare and seldom if ever imported. Two, the Imperial and Guildings,
are almost extinct, and of one, Anattereri , there is not even a skin either at
the Natural History Museum or Lord Rothschild's Museum at Tring.
One may divide these Parrots into three groups : (1) Those that
have white beaks, which are to be found mostly in Mexico and the
southern parts of North America and the islands, Cuba, Dominica,
Jamaica, St. Vincent, and the Bahamas ; and I may add here that
where a Parrot has a white beak he also has white or yellowish feet.
(2) Parrots that have black beaks with a red or yellow spot, found
mostly in Central America. (3) Those with black beaks, which come
chiefly from Brazil ; birds having black beaks have grey feet. There
are exceptions to this rule, but taken as a whole I do not think there
are any Parrots with black beaks found in Mexico, nor are there birds
with white beaks found in Brazil.
The Amazon Parrot in its native state does not build a nest, but lays
its eggs in a hole in a tree. The eggs are white and generally two in
number. With the exception of the Bahama Parrot, which I believe
was bred by the late Mr. Bonhote, none of these Parrots have bred in
this country.
The question of sexing Parrots has often been a problem, for the
plumage in the Amazons is the same in both male and female. Many
suggestions have been put forward for determining the sex, such as the
shape of the beak, whether long and narrow or thick and broad, the
colour of the eye, the shape of the head, whether round or flat, and so
on, but none of these have proved very satisfactory.
Personally I have always sexed my own birds by feeling the pelvic
bones. In the male bird these bones lie so close together that they feel
as if they actually touched, but in the female they are wider apart.
In a young female they may be very close together, though they never
actually touch, but as the bird becomes adult they widen until they may
be an inch or more apart, wide enough to allow the egg to pass through.
In keeping a number of birds together I have noticed that the only .
males I have had are as a rule smaller, more compact birds than the
females and the green is of a deeper shade. But male Parrots in
this country are extremely rare, and it is not often that one has the
chance of seeing the two sexes together. One has to ask why this is--
I think there are probably three reasons : First, they are harder to
catch if adults ; secondly, they are far more delicate than the females ;
thirdly, the traders go for the big, fine looking birds, and leave the
smaller ones behind as not being so desirable.

Most of this group are eminently fitted for cage and aviary life, and
make charming pets, even the most fastidious person could hardly say
it was cruel to keep a Parrot in captivity. They delight in human
society, and are extremely responsive to kindness, and the more
a Parrot is petted and played with the more fascinating pet will it
become. A Parrot should not be left alone in a room for long at a time,
or it will become dull and mope, and if it has nothing to play with will
suffer from ennui, and may take to feather plucking for the sake of
something to do. Birds treated like this deteriorate in intelligence anc
become uninteresting, and are not half so amusing as those that see
plenty of society. That is why Parrots do so well at the Zoo ; they not
only have a constant stream of visitors, but all sorts of tit-bits are
continually being offered to keep them on the qui vive. No one, there-
fore, should undertake to have a Parrot unless he or she is prepared to
devote a certain amount of time to it.
Parrots are not only highly intelligent and therefore highly sensitive,
but they are very active birds, and need plenty of exercise and amuse-
ment to keep them in health and spirits. Personally I prefer a square
cage with a flat top, with china seed- and water-pots, and I do not think
it matters if it is not very big, as long as a bird is constantly let out to
exercise its wings. I do not mean by this that he should fly about the
room--they are clumsy fliers at the best, and if they have their full
wings have a way of dashing into windows and other objects in the
room, to the detriment of themselves and everything else. So I keep
one wing slightly cut, and if they try to fly they fall on the floor.
They very soon learn this, and by the time the wing feathers have
grown again the desire to fly has probably left them, and they are quite
content to flap their wings on a stand or the back of a chair.
For my own Parrots I have a rather heavy steel dog chain hanging
from my ceiling with a hook at the bottom on which I hang each cage
in turn. Here the birds can climb up and down and exercise their wings
to their heart's content.
I may add here that the links of the chain should be so big that there
is no possibility of the beak or claws being caught. I also give my
birds a small piece of steel chain for them to play with, which I hang on
one side of the cage. They will go through it link by link, an occupation
which keeps them happy and amused for hours.
In all cases steel chains should be used, as brass ones are apt to
get verdigris upon them, which is poisonous. Parrots also need
something to exercise their beaks upon, and sticks of wood, reels of
cotton, etc., make the most delightful playthings. The best wood is
willow, beech, poplar, chestnut, and hazel, as these will not splinter.
To those living in the country sticks of wood with the bark on are
easily supplied ; but to those living in towns the supply of these often
presents a real difficulty, and to those I would recommend clothes pegs.

They are cheap--about a penny half-penny a dozen--they are made of
a very hard wood that does not splinter, and one will last a few days.
Paper is also very useful, old letters or bits of notepaper they will play
with for a long time.
When once an Amazon Parrot is acclimatized, it is moderately
hardy, and can easily be kept in confinement for many years. The
best food mixture I have found consists of equal parts of the best
mammoth Spanish Canary seed, sunflower seed, and hemp seed ; add
to this in the same quantity a good mixture of poultry corn, containing
wheat, oats, dari, and maize. Personally I prefer white or striped
sunflower seed, as black is apt to stain the excreta, and I am sure it
pays well in all cases to give the very best seed. To this may be added
fruit of all sorts, pea nuts, dry biscuit, and mine always have a small
piece of toast and butter or marmalade for breakfast and a small piece
of cake or sugar for tea. The best fruits are apple, banana, grapes, and
cherries, which they seem specially fond of; but strawberries and
raspberries I have never found a Parrot care much for. For green food,
lettuce, watercress, and peas in the pod, but no green food should ever
be given that has had the frost upon it.
Coarse sand should be used for the bottom of the cage, which should
be cleaned out daily and a clod of earth for them to peck at every few
days keeps them in health. Water, of course, should be given, fresh
every day, and I always use water that has been kept in a room some
hours and not straight out of a cold water tap. For freshly imported
birds or delicate birds, it should be slightly warmed. The vessel in
which the water is given should be of china and should not only be
rinsed out every day, but wiped dry in order to entirely get rid of the
slimy deposit that water leaves. Many people have an idea that water
is bad, or, at least, unnecessary for Parrots, but when one realizes
that these birds come from a country teeming with moisture and full of
luscious juicy fruits, such as we know nothing of, to be deprived of
water and fed on a hard seed diet is nothing short of cruel. I had a
Parrot once that had been treated like this, and had had no water for
four years--all it was given was a spoonful or two of tea once a day.
She was a fine big bird, but the feathers were hard and dry and had no
gloss on them whatever. I had of course to use great caution in giving
her water at first or she would have over-drunk herself. I gave just
a few sips at a time, until at the end of a week I was able to leave the
water in the cage for her to help herself as she pleased. It was really
extraordinary at the end of a month how different the plumage had
become, the feathers lost all that wiriness and assumed a smooth soft
glossy appearance.
A Parrot should not be left in a draught even for a few minutes ;
at the same time I do not think they should be exposed to the full glare
of the sun ; few birds if left to themselves choose to sit in the sun for

long at a time. They should, I think, too, have their cages covered over
at night, leaving an air-hole at the top ; they like the protection from
light and it keeps them warm.
Most Parrots have strong likes and dislikes, some liking men best
while others attach themselves to women ; it used to be thought
that this was a matter of sex, male birds liking women and vice versa,
but I feel sure that this has nothing to do with it. Why it is, I do not
know, but certain it is that you will never find the same Parrot equally
attached to both a man and a woman. The same way with children
--some love them and get very excited if a child enters the room,
others dislike them and are not to be trusted with them. At the same
time a Parrot seems to learn more easily from a woman than a man,
and they will imitate children in an extraordinary way, laughing
and crying and quarrelling exactly as they do ; the high-pitched shrill
voices seem to appeal to them rather than the deeper voice of a man.
It seems a well-known fact that Parrots more easily pick up sounds
outside a house than those inside, and are able without any trouble to
imitate cocks crowing, dogs barking, motor-horns, the bleating of
sheep, and so on.
The best time to teach a Parrot to talk is when he is quiet, and a very
good plan is after he is covered over for the night to repeat some ten
or twelve times what you wish him to learn, and then without another
word leave the room and let him think it over. Some learn very
easily while others never get beyond a word or two, but all can make
some sort of noise and all can scream at times. If one has a young
bird the screaming can be checked to a certain extent by covering
over, or putting the cage on the floor, or taking him out and distracting
his attention in some way, but an old and inveterate screamer is hard
to do with, for he becomes a nuisance to everybody around him, and
if there are other Parrots he may teach them to take to this horrid
habit.
The best time, too, for taming a Parrot is in the evening, they are
far gentler then and can be coaxed and handled more easily, whereas
in the morning they are often, like some people, inclined to be
" nervy
I never let my Parrots come out of their cages by themselves, but
always make them step on to my hand first. They soon learn to do this,
but it needs a little courage to start the first time with a strange Parrot.
Patience and gentleness are the two great factors for training a Parrot
and gaining its confidence. Never be in a hurry, and once be hasty you
may undo the work of months. But once it is tame there is no end to
what it will allow you to do with it--turn it upside down, roll it on its
back as if it was a ball of fluff, kiss it all over and, in fact, do just what
you like with it, and it will never turn on you, but just play gently
with your fingers.

Sometimes it is a difficult problem to get a Parrot out of the
travelling cage or transfer it from one cage to another. It is useful to
know he will always go upwards. So if you lie the cage he is in with the
door open uppermost, then put the cage he is to go into with the door
open downwards, and having the two doors together, you will find he
will at once walk into the upper cage.
Parrots are long lived and many take a long time before they feel
" at home " in new surroundings. A newly imported Parrot that has
come straight from a dealer generally takes about a month to settle
down, but a Parrot that has come from another home may take
much longer. I had a bird once that belonged to an old lady, and he was
supposed to be a marvellous talker. I heard him several times before
I decided to buy him, so I knew he could talk. But having got him home
he became dumb, and it was over six months before he even uttered
a sound. Then quite suddenly when we were sitting at dinner one
night he started, and we were spellbound. He was certainly a wonder-
ful bird, and from that moment he was all right. Another time
I brought home a Parrot and apparently it seemed in the best of
health, but for three days it ate nothing and I got most fearfully
worried about it. I tried everything I could think of, but nothing
seemed any good ; suddenly I had a brain-wave, and it certainly was
an inspiration--I took the seed out of the china dish and put it into
a zinc one. The trick was done--he fed from that moment, and though
I have had that bird since 1917 he still won't eat his seed except in
a zinc dish, though he does not mind the water in a china one. It just
shows what conservative creatures they are.
The age of a Parrot, especially after a few years, is difficult to tell,
but there are certain signs which denote young birds. Very young birds
are generally uniformly green all over, showing no blue or yellow on
the head, or wherever the predominant colour of the adult bird may be,
and no red on the shoulder, but birds as young as that are seldom seen
on the market. When they arrive here they have generally moulted
out, and show some marks of the adult plumage. But even when
moulted out, there are other signs to tell if a bird is young. The eye
is paler and does not show the bright orange or red when the pupil is
being dilated. In the case of birds with black beaks, the beak is greyer
in the young bird, becoming blacker with age, and the nails on the feet
are black at first, afterwards turning grey. The feet in young birds
feel very soft and supple, in older birds they become hard and rough,
and in very old birds extremely so.
To my mind there is no more delightful pet than a young Amazon
Parrot, preferably a Blue-front, that you can bring up and teach as
you like, and they are well worth all the trouble and patience they
involve. But it does mean both of these and a certain amount of risk
too, to get it accustomed to our food and variable climate. The matter

of feeding often presents a difficult problem, for when brought over
they are mostly fed on a food called farina, if not that then on boiled
maize. If only the importers would get them accustomed to hard seed
and water before shipping them, I believe the mortality would be
considerably reduced. Young birds are often very shy about trying
anything new to eat, and it is quite a fallacy to think you can starve a
Parrot into eating what he does not want to. He generally prefers to die.
If possible it is a good plan to put a young bird near an oft
acclimatized one, then when he sees him eating apple or seed or
whatever it is he will be tempted to try it for himself. The dealers often
adopt the plan of keeping two birds in one cage when they first arrive,
as one will copy the other in the way of eating, and they keep each
other warm. But the moment they begin to recover from the long
journey and to get vigorous they will have to be separated, as they
may fight and the stronger will bully the weaker, and they have a way
of going for the toes and biting them off, hence the number of Parrots
one sees without their full complement.
In the case of feeding young birds just imported, or birds that are
sick, I find it is no good keeping to any hard and fast rule. They are
sometimes as difficult to suit as any human baby, and it is often not
a case of what is best for them but what they will condescend to try.
The books tell you never to give tea, coffee, slops of any kind, animal
food, etc., but what are you to do ? A bird that is ill will not as a rule
touch hard seed, one must try something or you will lose your bird. And
I may say here that until a bird is actually dead I never despair. They
may look dying a dozen times a day and yet pull round. I had a case
in point some few years back in a baby Blue-front. She had only just
arrived, in fact, had only been here an hour or so when I first saw her.
I spotted her at once because of her remarkable plumage and carried
her off. She had been fed entirely on farina, and I tried everywhere in
London to get this stuff but failed, so I had to resort to all sorts of other
things. Bread and milk, bovril and toast, rice-pudding, potato--
she would just give a peck at each in turn and then refuse to even try
it again. Seed, apple, or banana she would not even try. At last one
morning when I uncovered her she looked about as bad as any bird
could, and I thought " Well this is the end ". I tried all the morning to
feed her and induce her to take something, but it was no good. Lunch
time came, and on the table was a plain suet pudding. I cut off a piece
and put it in her cage, and to my utter surprise she tried it, ate it, and
later on I gave her some more and for the best part of a week she lived
on plain suet pudding ! At the end of the week she was ready to try
hard seed, and to-day is one of the handsomest birds I have ever seen
and a very good talker. Well, one has to ask oneself: " What did the
trick ? 95 " Was it the suet ? 55 I am very much inclined to think it
was. Anyhow that suet pudding broke down all hard and fast rules

with me. One is told that butter is a thing a Parrot must never touch,
and yet over and over again I have noticed the first thing a Parrot will
go for when let out at a meal time is butter. They seem to crave for it,
therefore can it be so bad for them ?
Another time I was staying on Dartmoor and early one morning
when I was still in bed I had a message that a little girl had come over
the moors and wanted to know if the lady was there " that knew all
about Parrots ", and if she would come at once to a Parrot that was
very ill. I went and found the bird lying on its side at the bottom of the
cage, with its eyes shut, looking for all the world as if about to give up
this life. I took it in my hand and gave it a teaspoon of brandy and
warm milk. It opened its eyes. After ten minutes I gave it another
spoonful. In a short time it stood up on its feet and we then gave it
some warmed bovril and toast which it took and liked. It then got up
on its perch. For a week I visited it, and fed it on warmed bovril and
toast, boiled potato, boiled rice, and boiled cabbage. At the end of
that time it was recovered enough to go back to its hard seed and
water. It was a very old bird, and though it died eventually, it lived
for some months after I saw it. I have given these two examples for
what they are worth.
I am not able here to go into the various diseases Parrots may suffer
from ; all I want to attempt to do is to suggest a few of the remedies
I have found of use in bringing young or sick birds round. Warmth is
always a great help. They should be kept in a room that is warmed
during the winter and for a newly imported bird I always keep three
sides of the cage covered for the first few weeks. I never feel a bird is
really acclimatized until it has been through one winter here. But
a really sick bird requires to be kept fairly near a fire. So often on
getting a young bird home it develops one of two things, either running
at the nostrils, which means a cold, and may, if not taken at once, turn
to bronchitis or pneumonia, or its digestion goes wrong, and it gets
diarrhoea or the reverse, constipation and enteritis. Once it develops
enteritis I doubt if there is much to be done ; it is a horrible disease and
carries off more birds than almost anything else. But whatever is the
matter a bird should be taken in hand at once and not left for a day or
so before some remedy is tried.
For running at the nostril, bathe the nostril with a piece of cotton-
wool and a few drops of glyco-thymoline and warm water, taking care
it does not go into the eyes ; then put a spot of vaseline on the nostrils.
To do this it is best to get the bird out of the cage either on the top or
the back of a chair, then with a cloth over the left hand seize it round
the neck from the back, holding it just so that it cannot bite, but not
tight enough to throttle it, then with the right hand bathe the nostrils,
etc. After a few times it seems to like it ; it is soothing and at once
clears the air passages. Substituting sawdust in a thick layer for sand

at the bottom of the cage, and sprinkling this with a few drops of
eucalyptus will help to dry up the catarrh, but one has to remember
that it is pretty strong stuff and very few drops will suffice.
For diarrhoea a few drops of brandy in the water or a small pinch of
prepared chalk in the food. If it still continues, take the bird right off
seed and give some other food, so as to give the stomach a rest. Toast,
which is more digestible than bread, can be given with either warmed
bovril or warmed milk, and I may say here that I have never found
cow's milk very good ; I much prefer using Nestle's, the sweetened
kind. Rusk or arrowroot biscuit soaked in it makes a digestible diet,
and to this may be added a tiny pinch of chalk. Boiled potato, boiled
rice, or porridge can be tried, and apple is a wonderful help. Some
birds when they are ill will only eat apple, and I just let them have
as much as they like.
For constipation, if apple or banana does not help then take them
right off seed, and feed as above. Some birds are terribly thin when
they arrive, and these should be fattened if possible. Rolled or Quaker
oats mixed with the food are very excellent and much liked. Sugar
is also a great fattener. Scott's cod-liver oil emulsion is another splen-
did food. Some birds love it and will look eagerly for it while it is being
prepared, others won't touch it, and others it does not suit at all,
causing sickness. The bottle must be warmed until it will run, then take
a teaspoon of it and crumble into it some sponge-cake and give twice
a day. When the pupil looks very black and is much dilated, it generally
means one of two things, either the bird is in pain or the heart is in
some way affected. Putting the bird on a warmed hot-bottle (not too
hot) may give relief for the first, and for the latter warmed black coffee
with brown sugar they will take in a spoon and like, and it helps
to stimulate the heart.
In conclusion there are two things to remember in birds that are
ill. First that the food must be on a level with them, within easy reach,
as a sick bird does not like moving about, or it must be offered to them
from time to time, either in a spoon or pot. Secondly, that an ill bird
requires feeding little and often, a spoonful or so every two to four
hours, and that it should not be left to go all night without something.
It is natural that all Parrots should moult some time during the
year, that is shed their feathers, but some do it spasmodically, only
shedding a feather or two now and again, while others may do an out-
and-out moult. There seems no rule as to what time of year one may
expect this, as Parrots never seem to settle down to the altered seasons
in this country from their own, and even Parrots belonging to the
same species may not moult at the same time of year, but one is glad
when they do not choose the winter months for this performance.
Parrots about to go through a thorough moult generally start by eating
enormously, entirely finishing up the contents of the seed-dish, and

this should be replenished during the day if necessary ; they should
have as generous and liberal diet as possible to enable them to make
the necessary blood to push out the old feathers and make the new
ones ; by doing this one prevents what is known as getting " stuck
in the moult ". It is curious to note that a bird about to go through
the moult always starts by shedding the bastard wing feathers, also
that a feather shed in one wing is almost immediately followed by
the corresponding feather in the other wing.
I conclude my account of this group of New World Parrots with
a list and short description of the different species :--
Guilding's Parrot (Amazona guildingi) .--This Parrot is exceedingly
rare, in fact a short time ago it was thought to be extinct, but a few
examples are known to have survived, and we now see a very good
specimen in the Parrot house at the Zoo. It is a large and magnificent
bird, and its plumage is a rich mixture of yellow, brown, orange,
and blue ; beak white. Habitat , St. Vincent.
The Imperial Parrot (A. imperialis) , like the preceding one, is
another of the largest and most beautiful of its type. Also thought
to be almost extinct, but two years ago the Zoo were fortunate enough
to procure a specimen. The back is green, but the head, neck, and
breast are a wonderful dark purply red, the collar being almost black
purple ; beak horn brown. This Parrot was formerly known as the
" August " Parrot, Amazona ( Chrysotis) augusta. Habitat , the Island
of Dominica.
The St. Lucia Parrot (A. versicolor) is another rare bird ; green,
with a blue head and salmon pink breast ; beak black with a light
yellow spot. Habitat , the Island of St. Lucia.
Bouquet's Parrot (A. bouqueti). --Another of the big Amazons.
Green with a blue head, and bright red on the upper breast ; beak,
yellow-white. Habitat , Dominica.
The Vinageous Parrot (A. vinacea ) is much smaller than any of
the preceding. Green, with a red band on the forehead and lores, red
also in the tail and wings, and the breast wine colour ; beak, red with
a yellow tip. Habitat , S.E. Brazil and Paraguay.
The Guatemala Parrot (A. guatemala) .--A large green bird with
the top of the head blue ; beak, horn colour. Habitat , Central America.
The Green-headed Parrot (A. vir&amp;nticeps) .--Another big bird
very much like guatemala, but the blue on the head is more restricted,
and is only on the forehead and lores ; beak, horn colour. Habitat ,
Costa Rica.
The Mealy Parrot [A. farinosa) .--A large green bird with a yellow
orange mark on its head which merges into purple black on the nape.
The plumage has the appearance of being covered with fine white dust,
giving it the name of " Mealy " ; beak, white. Habitat, British Guiana.
The Plain-coloured Parrot (A. inornata) .--It is green all over

with slight purple on the nape of the neck. There is red in the wings,
but not in the tail ; beak, white horn. Habitat, Ecuador.
The Mercenaria Parrot (A. mercenaria). --A much smaller Parrot,
dark green above, light green below, red in the wings and tail, and
yellow on the edge of the wing ; beak, black with a yellow spot.
Habitat, Colombia and Ecuador.
The Blue-fronted Parrot (A. (estiva). --These are the most
frequently imported, they make very good talkers, and are lively and
amusing in their ways, and can be thoroughly recommended as pets.
Green with a blue forehead, head, cheeks, and neck yellow, but this
may vary very much, and I have seen some Blue-fronts showing no
yellow and others no blue. There is red in the wing and tail ; beak,
black. Habitat, Brazil.
The Orange-winged Parrot {A. amazonica). --Green with the
forehead blue, crown and lores yellow, orange in the wing and tail ;
beak, black yellow. Habitat, Colombia.
The Yellow-shouldered Parrot (A. ochroptera ) is a very pretty
Parrot. Green, with the head and top of the shoulders yellow, red
in the wing ; beak, white. Habitat, Venezuela.
Rothschild's Parrot (A. rothschildi) .--Very much like the preceding
species, but the yellow on the head and shoulder more restricted.
Habitat, Bonaire Island.
The Yellow-fronted Parrot (A. ochrocephala) .--Green, yellow on
the forehead, red in the wings and tail ; beak, black with a pink
or yellow spot near the base. Habitat, Venezuela.
The Panama Parrot (A. panamensis). --Very like the preceding
one, but smaller with less yellow on the head and beak entirely white.
This and the Yellow-fronted make very good all-round talkers. Habitat ,
Colombia and Panama.
The Yellow-naped Parrot (A. auripalliata) .---Green, with a yellow
collar, red in the wings and tail ; beak, black. Most of the birds that
come over here are young showing no yellow collar, which they do not
acquire for some years. They are most desirable and talented birds,
but delicate when first imported. Habitat, Western Mexico to Costa
Rica.
Levaillant's or Double-fronted Parrot (A. levaillanti) .--A
large handsome bird, green 5 with the head and neck yellow, a large
splash of red or yellow on the top of the wing, and red in the wings and
tail ; beak, white. Some of these make wonderful talkers, but are
very nervous birds when first they come over. Habitat, Mexico.
Natterer's Parrot (A. nattereri) resembles A. farinosa, but has
blue on the front and round the eyes. Very rare. Habitat, Brazil.
Dufresne's Parrot (A. dufresneana) .--A large green bird with
an orange forehead, blue cheeks, orange in the wings and tail ; beak,
white with a pink spot. Habitat, Guiana.

Members of the Club, 21 ; guests, 20 ; total, 41.
The Chairman said that before opening the meeting he would
like, on behalf of the Club, to welcome the guests, Dr. and Mrs. G. M.
Vevers, Mr. and Mrs. G. S. Cansdale, and Mr. Walter Goodfellow.
He was pleased to see the " Second Generation " represented by
Mrs. Claud Morny (nee Aline Ezra) and Dr. D. W. Seth-Smith.
Also he wished to thank Mr. G. N. Clark for the excellent drawing of
Guilding's Parrot reproduced on the special menu card.
The Chairman then said that it gave him especial pleasure to occupy
the Chair on this occasion, as the dinner was in honour of Miss Knobel.
He thought he was justified in claiming to be Miss Knobel's avicultural
friend of longest standing. He then dealt briefly with Miss Knobel's
long association--over a quarter of a century--with the affairs of the
Society, and said he wondered how many members realized how
much they owed to. her selfless service. He touched on some of her
avicultural achievements, and stressed the success she had had in
keeping rare Amazons. Finally, he said, all members must feel
gratified that Miss Knobel had accepted a Vice-Presidency of the
Avicultural Society.
After the toast " Miss Knobel ", the guest of honour in a charmingly
simple speech thanked the members and guests for the honour they
had accorded her in attending. Referring to her term of office, she
said she had experienced difficulties, especially in the early days, but,
nevertheless, she had loved every day of it, and it had been the means

of her making innumerable friends. She had not sought reward,
but if she had, the present demonstration of regard would have more
than repaid her.
Miss Knobel showed a further series of slides, A Peep at Japan and
the Japanese, exquisitely hand-coloured by her father, the late Dr. E. B.
Knobel.
Mr. A. Ezra showed a large collection of slides to illustrate A Shooting
Expedition in Central Asia. He said :
" The pictures I am showing were taken by me on a shooting
expedition in Central Asia in 1902. Starting from Calcutta, I travelled
by train to Rawalpindi, and from there a drive of 200 miles brought
me to Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. Here I made all arrange-
ments for food, followers, and transport. Soon after leaving Srinagar
we successfully tackled two mountain passes. These were the Tragbal
Pass, 11,700 feet, and the Burzil Pass, 13,500 feet. On the way to
Gilgit I spent a few days after markhor, ibex, and bears. We did the
journey of 150 miles, from Gilgit to the Pamirs, in fifteen days, the
progress being so slow on account of the difficult nature of the country.
The mountain-tracks in places were most precipitous and dangerous.
These tracks were often conducted round the edge of precipices
overhanging the river by artificial ladders and ledges built out from
the cliff, with stones laid upon supports of branches fitting into holes
in the rocks. The most unsafe looking bit was where a log not more
than 6 inches wide was thrown across, with one end of it resting on
a rock jutting out 20 feet above, and the lower end on some stones.
Under this there was a sheer drop of about 2,000 feet into an angry
river. Without the help of the fine Hunza men who were sent with
us, we should have had the greatest difficulty in getting over this
terrible country safely. We had our first view of the Pamir region
from the top of the Killik Pass (16,700 feet). Here we stood at the
point where three great Empires meet--Russia to the north, to the
east the boundaries of the Chinese Empire, and India to the south.
After shooting a few Ovis poli in some of the valleys in the Ghinese
Pamirs, I went on to the Russian Pamirs where I shot some more.
As no one ever shoots in the latter place, game was most plentiful,
and one day I saw as many as 200 Ovis poli rams in a small valley.
From here I worked my way down to the plains of Kashgaria, and it
was a treat to come down from those awful altitudes and to see trees
and flowers again. For over six weeks I had not been lower than
12,000 feet, and most of the time well over 14,000 feet. Leaving
Kashgar at the beginning of August, I went to the Thian Shan
Mountains in search of Wapiti--travelling through Maralbashi, Aksu,
and Koksu--a distance of 576 miles. After shooting the Asiatic
Wapiti in the Koksu Valley I went on to Kuldja, from where a drive
of 850 miles in a tarantass (a four-wheeled carriage without springs)

brought me to Tashkent in Russian Turkestan in 15 days. Since
leaving the railway at Rawalpindi and reaching the railway at
Tashkent I travelled 2,583 miles in seven months, having walked and
ridden 1,533 miles and driven 1,050 miles. Of course this does not
include the enormous distances covered in search of game. From
Tashkent I took the train to Samarcand and Bokhara, spending a
couple of days at each of these interesting old places. A journey of
40 hours from Bokhara by train brought me to Krasnovodsk. Here
I crossed the Caspian Sea to Baku in about sixteen hours, and there
I visited some interesting naphtha wells. From Baku I took the
express to Moscow and Petrograd, making a stay of a few days at
each place. Thence to Paris and home, bringing to an end a most
interesting and enjoyable expedition."
While not, of course, of an avicultural nature, the slides proved of
the greatest interest, and included several of Vultures scavengering.
Mr. Ezra said that on one occasion the carcass of a tiger was com-
pletely devoured in seven minutes.
Then followed some half-dozen slides of Mr. Ezra's remarkable
performing Ring-necked Parrakeet. This bird was in his possession
for nineteen years and was about twenty-five years old at the time
of its death. Amongst its many and varied accomplishments were
twirling a lighted torch, using a bow and arrow, ringing a prayer
bell, and threading small beads.
Meetings and Dinners during the 1948-9 session have been
arranged for the following dates :--

The South African and Foreign Wild Bird Club held its champion-
ship show in the City Hall in Johannesburg on 9th and 10th January
of this year and I had the pleasure of being shown round by Dr. Wolf,
a well-known aviculturist of that city and a member of the Avicultural
Society.
It is a good many years since I saw so many gems of South Africa's
avifauna displayed together. Some species I had never seen alive
before and I had certainly never seen such a galaxy of African seed-
eaters under the same roof.
Imagine forty-six Violet-eared Waxbills, all in perfect condition,
contained in two classes and twenty-five Melba Finches in another two,
besides hundreds of other seed-eaters in condition such as we seldom see
them in Europe.
There was a host of rarities, the most outstanding of which was
a wonderful aviary bred Lilac-breasted Roller whose colours must be
seen to be believed and a finger tame South African Hoopoe and three
exquisite Sunbirds, a Malachite, and two Greater Double-collared.
The softbill classes were very disappointing considering the vast
number of attractive softbills found in the Union. One would have
expected to have seen at least some Glossy Starlings, Bush Shrikes,
and Kingfishers of which there are so many brilliant species in South
Africa. Of the remaining softbills there were three Levaillants Barbets,
but only one in really good condition, a Knysna Touracou, a lovely
but timid bird looking very much out of its element, two Layard's
Bulbuls and a number of Zosterops or Gape White-eyes. There were
a few African Parrots, three or four good African Greys, a Cape
Parrot (Poicephalus robustus angolensis ), a very attractive species of which
I came across quite a few in captivity. It is the common parrot of
South Africa and individuals vary a great deal in character. Two
birds I came in contact with had outstanding personalities and their
linguistic abilities were quite equal to any Grey. I saw quite a few
for sale in the Durban market and had it been possible to have brought
them back to England I would certainly have purchased a couple.
There was a single Meyer's Parrot, quite a number of Peach-faced
Lovebirds, also Masked, Black-cheeked and quite a few West African
Red-faced. Besides these were a few exotics, Lemon-crested and
Leadbeater's Cockatoos, a Swainson's Lorikeet, a pair or two of
Bourke's and a Gockatiel.
The vast concourse of seed-eaters included many old favourites
which we knew in those seemingly far off halcyon pre-war days when
aviculture reached its zenith in regard to the number and variety of

species imported into Great Britain. We shall never see those days
again (which is perhaps a good thing) owing to restrictions put on
their export from the various countries from which they originated.
There were nineteen entrants in the first class for Cape Canaries
(i Serinus c. canicollis) and a very fine bird belonging to Dr. Wolf not only
carried off the first prize, but was also awarded a special cup. Beside
the foregoing the next eight classes were devoted to the Serin family.
In a class to itself was the very rare Symon's Drakensbery " Linnet 55
(Spinus symonsi ), while in another class was a rather uncommon bird,
the Cape Siskin, known locally as the Totta Siskin. The local nomen-
clature is apt to be rather misleading to the stranger. The bird known
to us here as the Black-throated Singing Finch (S. a. atrogularis) is
called the " Peach Canary 55 in South Africa, of which there were
eleven in one class, and the "Black-headed Canary", well known in
England as the Alario Finch, was also well represented. In a class on
its own was a "King Black-head". This is the rare Damaraland
Alario and differs from the common bird in having the forehead,
eyebrows, a line through the eye, a spot on the ear-coverts and the chin
and throat pure white ; quite a striking looking little bird.
Twelve Green Singing Finches made up one class. These were much
larger birds than those we used to see imported from West Africa.
Another class contained ten " Bull Seisies ". These I recognized as
Sulphury Seed-eaters. These too were much larger and brighter than
any we saw in Europe in those nostalgic pre-war days.
Twelve classes contained no less than 174 Waxbills, many old
favourites amongst them, including the forty-six Violet-ears already
mentioned, of which several were aviary-bred birds. Dr. Wolf men-
tioned that these Waxbills feed more upon insects than upon seed and
are not nearly as granivorous as the other Waxbills. Indeed most
South African aviculturists feed these birds mainly on small white
termites which are easily obtained and are a godsend to keepers of
small and delicate Finches and softbills in South Africa.
In a class on its own was a single Red-winged Finch, a rare relative
of the Melba Finch, a bird which I saw in its native state in the
mountain forests of the Drakensberg Mountains in the Northern
Transvaal.
It was good to see examples of the once familiar Lavender Finch,
these were the Cape variety which is a rather rare and uncommon
bird, found in the coastal forests of Natal. It is a much darker species
than the West African one, has the tail black and lacks the white
spots of the other bird. It is very difficult to accustom it to captivity
and very few aviculturists possess examples.
There were three classes for Fire Finches, the Little Ruddy from
the Transvaal, the Jameson's, and the larger Natal Ruddy. The class
for Blue-breasted Waxbills contained twenty-three entries and all were

in superb condition, making it hard work for my friend Mr. Bellars,
of Durban, who was the judge, to make the awards.
A class devoted to Quail Finches contained several pairs of these
charming little ground birds. A bird I had never seen before was the
Zanzibar Mannakin, a bird rather like the well-known Black-headed
Mannakin except that it had striped sides.
Some of the class names were rather confusing to say the least to the
overseas visitor unused to the local vernacular. Thus "BaitMannetjie"
seemed to have no connection with anything avian. However, this
turned out to be a class for the beautiful little Scaly-headed Weavers,
a bird not richly coloured but extremely handsome with its pale fawn
grey plumage finely pencilled with black. " Rice-bird " was also
rather a misnomer as one naturally expected to see Java Sparrows, but
these turned out to be more old favourites, Red-headed Finches.
Class No. 191 was headed Flop ". This I thought could hardly
be a flop seeing that it contained five entries. On inquiry I found that
" Flop " was the local name for the Long-tailed Whydah, so called
because of its strange flopping nuptial flight. South African fanciers
state that there are two varieties of this bird, one which has straight
tail feathers and another which has wavy feathers. It was very
interesting to see the two types together. The one had a perfectly
straight tail and the other looked as if the long feathers had been
permanently waved.
In a class for Paradise Whydahs were also two species, firstly the
Common and also the much rarer Broad-tailed in which the tail
feathers are much shorter and very much wider than the other species.
The Paradise Whydah was bred last year by an aviculturist in the
Transvaal, an unusual achievement when one realizes the peculiar
breeding habits of this bird. For many years nothing was known of the
breeding habits of the sub-family Viduinae comprising the Pin-tailed,
the Queen, and the Paradise Whydahs and the Combasous or Steel
Finches. No nests or eggs had ever been found and fanciers in England
wondered why when they had healthy pairs of these birds that they
never attempted to breed. My friend Dr. Austin Roberts, the well-
known South African ornithologist, who only recently met with a rather
tragic death, suggested that these birds were parasitic, but he was
laughed at by European ornithologists for making such a seemingly
ridiculous statement.
However, it was found out after close ornithological investigation
that these birds make no nest of their own, but are parasitic on various
species of Waxbills. The Queen Whydah parasitizes the Violet-eared
Waxbill, the Pin-tailed the St. Helena Waxbill, and the Paradise the
Melba Finch.
A pair of Paradise Whydahs being in the same aviary as several
pairs of Melba Finches, the hen " Paradise " laid her eggs in the nest

of a Melba Finch removing those of the rightful owner. Three young
were reared, this being the first time that any of the Viduniae Finches
have been reared in captivity.
There were three species of the Gombasou or Steel Finches, one with
red beak and legs, another with white beak and red legs, and another
with white beak and white legs. It is not known what species this bird
parasitizes, but I rather think it is the Bronze-winged Mannakin as
I always saw them in the company of these Finches in a wild state during
the breeding season.
There were classes for Red-collared, Yellow-shouldered, White-
winged Whydahs and also the beautiful Crimson and Cape Weavers.
These latter rather resemble the well-known Napoleon Weaver, but
has never been freely imported into England.
Rock, Cape, and Yellow-breasted (or Red-backed Yellow) Buntings
each had their own classes and one for the latter contained no less
than thirteen specimens. It is one of the most beautiful of the Bunting
family and is distributed over the savanna country in South Africa.
There was a single example of the African Silverbill being entered
" not for competition ", a once well-known bird which has now
practically disappeared from South African aviculture.
A few Mannakins were on exhibition including the large and small
Magpie Mannakins, known locally as the Tri-coloured Nun and
Tri-coloured Mannakin respectively and scientifically as Amauresthes
fringilloides and Lepidopygia. n. nigriceps . There was also a single example
of a one time favourite and a very common bird about the rest camps
in the Kruger National Park, the little Bronze-winged Mannakin. It
is many years since this bird was offered for sale in Great Britain.
Two kinds of Larks only were on view but lam not sure of the species
as South African Larks are so much alike. One I think was Gray's Lark
and the other a pair of Smith's Lark Finches.
In a class marked " Choak " or Comoro Weavers were several of
the Hyphantornis Weavers, mainly the Masked, a very common bird
about the homesteads in the Transvaal.
The show was notable for its display of exotic Finches, chiefly
Australians, of which there was a splendid collection of Gouldians. In
the almost perfect climate of Natal and parts of the Transvaal these
birds breed very freely as do most of the other Australian Finches which
are very popular in South Africa. Besides these were many other species
of Finches from the Antipodes, Heck's and Common Grass Finches,
Cherry, Painted, Masked, Blue-faced Parrot, Ruficauda, Diamond,
and Zebra, these latter had seven classes to themselves and comprised
many varieties not seen in England including White, Silver, Fawn,
Cinnamon, a strange looking White-eared kind and a very peculiar
semi-melanistic type.
Amongst American birds were a number of Red-crested Cardinals,

American Goldfinches, and a single Pileated Finch. Amongst the
hybrids, in which I wasn't greatly interested, was a rather unique
cross, the progeny of a hen Zebra Finch and a cock Ruddy Waxbill.
This cross was unintentional, the owner having a very fine Ruddy Waxbill
which he wished to use for show purposes he separated it from the
others in his possession and put it in an aviary with Zebra Finches.
The bird on exhibition being the result. It had the whole of the breast
finely spotted. There were many Ribbon-Red-headed Finch hybrids.
In the Dove classes I noticed the Cape Masked, known as the
Namaqua in South Africa and several varieties of the Australian
Diamond Dove including the normal type, Silvers and Fawns. On
exhibition were Chinese painted Quail and two pair of the local
Harlequin.
Amongst the foreigners were a number of European Finches, Green-
finches, Goldfinches, Bullfinches, and a single English Sparrow. All
these looked pale and washed out except one outstanding Goldfinch
which carried off the premier award in its class.

BREEDING OF " CLARIN-JILGARO "

In the Spring of 1945 I received a female Glarin (Myadestes unicolor)

in a shipment from Mexico. After a few weeks of acclimatization
and rest I hung her cage in the large aviary wherein my fine old male
had been living for some three years. The male at once became
very excited, flying on to the hen's cage and going through all his
flirtations.
It was a pretty sight watching him sing to her with raised and
lowered tail, wings quivering, and many times rising into the air
several feet above the cage and " float " down quivering and singing
a lovely song, his feathers all puffed out and wings working overtime.
After three days of this introduction I released the female, and
again the male went through all his tricks of courting. The hen
would at times raise her tail and utter a soft whisper song, the while
quivering her wings.
Within a week a nest was completed on the ground at the base of
a thick bamboo clump. The nest was built of old leaves, rootlets,
grass, horsehair, etc., lined with some hair and more grass, the male
assisting in the structure and carrying of materials. The birds used
quite a lot of old rotten leaves that were quite wet.
No eggs were laid, or at least I did not find any in this nest. A male
Loochoo Robin proved quite annoying, and the nest was subsequently
abandoned. The second nest was soon started and this time built in

the shelter of the aviary, on top of a ledge about 7 feet from the floor;
again no eggs were found. Two more attempts were made,
both on the ground, one well concealed beneath a heap of dried
grass, sticks, and leaves. The last nest being quite unconcealed.
No eggs ! or did some bird do away with them ? This aviary I thought
at the time to be well mouse-proofed ; last winter I did catch a few
mice in it. Perhaps these pests ruined all attempts on the ground ?
The other inmates of this aviary were White-eyes, Alcippes, Waxwings,
Ptilogonys (Mexican Silky Flycatchers), Painted Quail, Warblers,
a Yuhina, and that Loochoo. All of these are not known to be nest
robbers, as the White-eyes had no trouble rearing several broods.
From the first day (May, 1945) the male fed the female many worms,
flies, and moths with much ardour. The male would take these
insects on the wing from my fingers, sometimes taking up to ten
mealworms. Each worm or moth, etc., would be seemingly swallowed
and then brought up again into a pouchlike cavity at the base of the
lower bill before feeding the hen. The female would receive the
food from the male the while both birds would quiver their wings.
A most interesting performance to observe. Even after the nesting
season was at an end, the male continued to feed the hen until late
in November. His beautiful song was often heard.
In 1946 pretty much the same story can be told except that only
three nests were built and still no eggs. During January of 1947
the hen unfortunately died and with her my immediate hopes of
rearing Solitaires.
In May of 1947 I was compelled to make a trip to New York, but
a week before I left a hen Jilgaro (Myadestes obscurus) was released
into the same aviary with the male Glarin. To my astonishment it
was love at first sight with pretty much the same performance as
heretofore related.
Leaving all the birds in the expert hands of my wife, I went off to
New York, thinking little of the success that later took place with
Glarin x Jilgaro.
Upon my return on 10th June, on entering the Glarin's aviary
the hen Jilgaro was nowhere about, but the male Glarin took worms
from my fingers at once, and these he " swallowed " and brought up
again into that " pouch ". Imagine my excitement as he flew straight
to the shelter, and there I found him feeding the hen Jilgaro on a
nest ! This nest was securely built on the same ledge that the former
hen Glarin had used in the shelter.
Later that day I found the hen off the nest, and I simply had to
peek, and to my great joy three speckled eggs were found. It was
about five days later that I noticed a change in the behaviour of
both birds. The hen left the nest at more frequent intervals (the
male did not assist in incubation), whereupon the male would feed

the hen, but would retain some of the worms and fly to the nest.
I could " see " him singing a whisper song and sink his head into
the nest very gently, and something that wiggled got food from his
mouth.
To those of you who have experienced a first" breeding my
feelings can well be understood. I did not dare look into the nest
that day, but the next I could wait no longer. Two naked young
were seen and one egg, which I removed as it proved to be rotten.
The male seemed to do most of the feeding, and after each feeding
he would wait for the young's excretion, which he would swallow
and then fly off, but I did not see him eject these droppings.
Incubation lasted twelve to fourteen days, the eggs being dull white
with rusty brown spots, more at the large end,
. The young advanced rapidly, one being somewhat larger than the
other. I looked into the nest twice a day, which the parents did
not seem to mind a bit. On or about the twelfth day after hatching
the parents threw the smaller one out of the nest, and when I put the
young one back the old birds again pushed him overboard, which
left me but one alternative, and I took the little Clarin-Jilgaro into
our house for hand rearing. Two days later the same thing happened
to the other young, and this time I saw the old male pushing it out.
After closely watching for an hour or more, I discovered that the old
birds were not feeding the young one, so I decided again to take this
one indoors.
The young were well feathered, and the predominant blue-grey
colour was heavily spotted with tan or beige spots, the wings were
greenish-brown, tails quite short still. The rearing of these two
presented no problem, as they gaped at once and were quite hungry
all the time. My wife and I fed them with mealworms (mostly
the white ones and the grub stage ones), moths, cream-cheese, elder-
berries, soaked dried currants, and a bit of banana. It may be of
interest to note here that the adults always went for the white meal-
worms first and the grubs, only taking the yellow ones after the
others were gone. While the young were still quite small the old
male would take very small mealworms. They did not go very
strongly for grasshoppers, but all day long the old male was hawking
insects and actually getting quite a few. Solitaires are delightful
birds to rear by hand, as they do remain very tame even when fully
grown.
The adults made one more feeble attempt to build, without result,
and the male continued to feed the hen well into November.
At this date, 15th February, 1948, the male is not yet feeding the
hen ; as a matter of fact they keep far apart and the hen is singing quite
a bit, which she does not do later and njost part of the year. At last
I learned for certain that female Solitaires do sing, and further proof

of this was given me by Mr. Griswold, Curator of Birds at the Phila-
delphia Zoo. Mr. Griswold once kept a Clarin a number of years
that sang quite nicely, but never very loud, nor as loud as some he
had kept. Upon the death of this bird a post mortem proved the bird
to have been a female. I did not hear my female Clarin sing beyond
the usual whisper song.
Now the two young birds are fully adult, having lost all their
juvenile plumage, and coming through the moult in fine shape. The
wings are greenish-brown, almost a dark olive-green, and the rest
of the plumage decidedly more on the blue-slate colouring than
a pure Clarin. One bird will remain a bit smaller than the other,
but both are singing very loudly, leading me to believe that both
are males.
The song, alas ! cannot be compared with the adult Clarin, nor is it
like a Jilgaro. However the two birds are not yet a year old, and the
song may change, especially after hearing the " old-man 55 it is hoped.
Some notes are repeated over and over again, but they both have
the Clarin whisper song down pretty well.
Although I do not particularly like a cross breeding, this one was
a last resort operation, and it worked. I am leaving Clarin-Jilgaro
parents together again this year to see what happens, although I do
have another hen Clarin who unfortunately has but one good eye.
I have only known of two possible breedings of Solitaires in captivity
before, one supposedly in Russia about fifty years ago and the other
in Germany, but whether the young matured is questionable.
ioth March the male is again feeding the hen and perhaps next
month nesting will commence. It would be an interesting experi-
ment, space and aviaries permitting, to try to breed one of the young
males to a hen Clarin ?
I wonder if in Mexico this Clarin X Jilgaro cross ever takes place
in the wild state ?
My tale of this hybrid seems to have no ending, but since I have
been so slow in writing this article, and since the year has advanced
I may as well relate the breeding results of 1948 to date also. First
I would like to record some of the hardships that I have experienced
in keeping these Solitaires.
During the past twelve years I have had a dozen or more of each
of the species this article covers, and almost all finally died of that
horrible " unbalanced " disease, i.e. the birds cannot sit straight on
the perch, sometimes will fall off and flutter about as if terribly
frightened. A post-mortem on one bird disclosed a liver disorder.
The curator of birds at the St. Louis Zoo hinted that too many
sweets can cause this.
I had been feeding pound cake daily plus soaked seedless raisin
and currants, apples, bananas, soft food (insectile mixtures), honey

and water, and all berries in season. I first removed all cake, and
for several months I had no further trouble and was quite happy
over the results ; I wondered if it could be that simple. It wasn't!
Suddenly one Jilgaro became unbalanced after months of perfect
health, and this bird by the way never had cake, but ate many raisins
and currants. The raisins were removed and only currants plus the
general insectile mix (soft food, made of Spratt's Mocking Bird Food,
grated carrot, ants' eggs, and dried flies) were given, and only a
limited amount of currants. For three days some Eno's fruit salts
was put into the drinking water, and the bird seemed to improve.
Now, after some three weeks of this diet, the bird again appeared
quite normal. This bird was kept in a large box cage in the green-
house since its arrival and sings at times, especially when water is
turned on. I wonder now if the raisins could have caused all the
trouble ? These Thompson seedless raisins are high in sugar content
and the skins may be a bit too much for Solitaires as a steady diet.
My nice old male Glarin (the breeding one) had two slight attacks
of&quot; unbalance " even in the large outdoor aviary, and upon removing
all raisins, cake, and honey water he became normal again. I have
replaced the cake and honeywater, as most of the other inmates
require them, and the Glarin has been perfect. From this one would
conclude that a steady diet of raisins causes this trouble in my Solitaires.
I have no experience with Townsends' Solitaires, but the Cuban
never troubled me so.
It may be of interest why the name Glarin is used instead of Glaring.
This I learned during a motor trip through Mexico some three years
ago last March. The Mexicans call him Glarin (pronounced Glareen),
the plural being Clarines (Glarinays). The Glarin is the foremost cage-
bird of the Mexican people, and one sees thousands of them in cages
all over Mexico, although I only heard two wild ones sing and saw
but one in a pine forest at about 8,000 feet elevation. I was delighted
and amazed at the bird-mindedness of the Mexican people, but here
I must stop, as I could go on and on about this trip and all the
wonderful birds I saw, both at liberty and caged. Another time,
perhaps, I may write my memoirs of this trip. Now back to Clarin-
Jilgaro.
During the last week of March (1948) the pair began building a
nest and again on the same ledge under the shelter. 2nd April the
first egg was laid ; 3rd April found the hen on the floor of the shelter
badly egg-bound and unable to move, the male the while quite
solicitous and close by. Picking the hen up, without a struggle from
her, I took her indoors and treated her with a drop of castor oil down
her throat and an enema of sweet and castor oils, then placing her
over the spout of a steaming kettle, which she seemed to appreciate.
After some minutes of this treatment the cage was placed on top of

a tropical aquarium, the warmest spot in our house, the temperature
being about 80 degrees F., and left her there. It was a good six hours
before the egg arrived and broken.
Toward evening the bird seemed to be quite normal and very
restless in the small cage, so against my better judgment I risked
turning her out again with her mate once more. The male was very
excited and treated her with great respect and sympathy, sitting
quite close to her until too dark for me to watch.
5th April another egg was laid and sitting in earnest began. One
young hatched 19th April, the other egg having disappeared. Both
birds fed the young until it left the nest on the 3rd May, when the
male seemed to take over, also feeding the hen at times.
Three or four days prior to the young leaving the nest the hen
began rebuilding the nest ; with the young in it. The rim of the
nest was built up much higher than when first built in March.
5th May the first egg was laid and then one a day until four were
in the nest. Sitting began about the 9th. On the 7th the one young
was seen to be sitting on the eggs, helping mama perhaps, but did not
stay long. By 8th May the young one was quite lively and was seen
in various parts of the aviary. The male alone fed the young after
it left the nest, and gave it mealworms (mostly the white ones),
cream cheese, frozen blue-berries (which were, of course, defrosted and
washed before given to the birds), and dried currants soaked over-
night in water. Frequently the old bird would be seen on the floor of the
shelter picking up bits of grit or sand, and perhaps old dried flies or
ant eggs, and then fly to the young one and feed it. I have seen this
Glarin taking small flowers and eating them. Once in a while a
rainworm is taken. Moths are a great favourite and, of course, the
u white mealworms " and also in grub form.
20th May, all four eggs hatched, and old birds very busy feeding
young, also my wife was kept busy taking mealworms to the aviary
every hour. About three days after the young had hatched I noticed
the male was looking rather badly and was trying to throw up all
day. Fortunately this only lasted one day, but I wonder if the large
family had something to do with it ? Glarins swallow the nestling
excretions, and I have never seen my male eject afterwards, four
babies may have been a bit too much for him. All went well, and
on 3rd June the babies began leaving the nest. That evening the nest
was empty and the old male now had his " beak " full with five
young to feed, as the first young was still begging. After a week of
this the old male was seen to take after the first young, so I removed
that young one.
The hen had started building another nest again before the four
young took off, but this time across the shelter on another ledge at
the same height. Two eggs were seen by 5th June ; on the sixth the

hen was again egg-bound and similarly treated successfully. I
returned her to her spouse on the morning of the 7th. Three eggs
were in the nest on the 8th, and two young hatched on 20th June.
These two left the nest this morning, 3rd July, and believe it or not,
the hen has a new nest back on the old ledge, and no doubt eggs are
in it now, but I trust my fellow aviculturists have long since had
enough of Glarin x Jilgaro. Seven young so far this year is quite a
Solitaire (y) record, and the two from last year are beauties, both
males and singing well.
One more interesting observation was made in that the young are
gently tapped on the forehead by the father when they do not at
once open their beaks for the food that the " old man " wishes to
put in them.

By A. A. Prestwich
Last autumn the first Psittacine Registry and Census was made.
Members responded very well and returns were received from almost
every breeder. Outside sources were, of course, rather more difficult
to cover and many birds of the commoner species were not registered.
This year it is hoped that the response in that direction will be
greater. It is important that every possible bird should be included
in the census, so that a true picture of the relative numerical strengths
of the various species can be made.
The Registry has been the means of pairing up quite a few odd
birds, but it has not proved as useful in this respect as was originally
anticipated. It was found that breeders already had their birds
paired in an extraordinarily satisfactory manner and there were
comparatively few odd birds.
The majority of members have not kept their records up to date.
Very few, for instance, have sent in any reports on this season's
breedings. If the Registry is to be of real value it is important that
particulars of new acquisitions, transferences, young reared, deaths,
etc., should be sent in.
And, as it has previously been pointed out, in these days of austerity,
all breedings are of interest, no matter how commonplace they may
seem. Therefore, it is specially requested that details of the season's
results are given in the space provided on the back of the registration
form inserted in the present number.

THE NEW. HON. SECRETARY AND TREASURER 1 67
THE NEW HON. SECRETARY AND TREASURER
The Avicultural Society has been most fortunate in finding in
Mr. A. A. Prestwich a most worthy successor to that great Hon.
Secretary and Treasurer, Miss E. Maud Knobel (who must have
broken all records of length of service of Hon. Secretaries in her
26 years of work for the Avicultural Society).
Mr. Prestwich first joined the Society in 1928, and since the war
has taken a more and more active part in the work of the Society ;
he was elected to the Council in 1946 and to the Executive Committee
in 1948 ; and in 1947 he undertook and organized the running of
the Psittacine Registry and Census. The formation of the British
Aviculturists' Club in 1946 was entirely Mr. Prestwich's idea and
enabled members to get to know each other personally and exchange
views in a way never before possible. Owing to his tactful and energetic
management the Club has become one of the most successful and
popular activities of the Society, and Mr. Prestwich's happy facility
for making all members feel welcome has contributed in no small
way to this end. The Club has held several important dinners, some
of an international character, and though, typically, Mr. Prestwich
has always preferred to remain in the background on these occasions,
he was the guiding spirit which ensured their success.
Mr. Prestwich is an experienced aviculturist in addition to being
a good all round ornithologist, and has a great knowledge of the
literature of these subjects, his library being one of the most important
in the country.
Mr. Prestwich is a Fellow of the Linnean, Zoological, Royal
Geographical, and Royal Horticultural Societies ; Fellow of the

Royal Australasian Ornithologists' Unions, South African Ornitho-
logical Society, Bombay Natural History Society, Avicultural Societies
of America and Australia, and La Societe Ornithologique de France.
The Society can certainly look forward to even greater successes
in the future under Mr. Prestwich's efficient guidance, and it is hoped
that all members will give him the full support which he so justly
deserves.

Reprinted from Avicultural Magazine, June, i8g8, p. 137
In responding to Mr. St Quintin's invitation to say a few words about
the breeding of the Shama, I may commence by remarking that
I have always a certain number of large, often rapacious, birds--
formerly I had a great many--and that, as my space is very limited,
breeding with me has been almost an impossibility, and rarely
attempted except when the birds insisted upon tempting their fate.
Moreover, my outdoor aviary, although provided with plenty of
shelters, is simply a little walled-in garden (an ordinary cats' play-
ground) covered over with wire netting to a height of over nine feet,
so that the inmates and their nests are much exposed to the weather ;
for most birds in a natural garden-aviary will roost and build in the
shrubs, and rarely will take to artificial nesting-places or structures
(see, for instance, How the Birds Learn , vol. iii, p. 174). Again, strange
as it may seem, I could hardly obtain such a creature as a mealworm,
and the few I did obtain only at fancy prices. And I was commonly
absent from home from morning till night, the birds being left pretty
much to take care of themselves, so that my experiences in this
particular direction have been incomplete.
Some of the Mynahs used to nest very freely ; the most energetic
and persevering were a male Acridotheres cristatellus and a female
A. tristis ; many eggs were laid, and mostly stolen by the male, but
a few young were hatched and partially reared. Artificial food only
was supplied, with which the parents were dissatisfied ; mealworms
and cockroaches would have saved the young. But the nest of all
others I look back upon with sorrow and regret contained four as
strong young White Jackdaws as ever were hatched. The male, who
stole the first egg as soon as laid, had been removed, and the female
would not feed the young on artificial food. I can still hear her
voice as I opened a window looking on to the aviary before starting
to the city ; she asked me for food for her babes in a pathetic and
reproachful tone ; but I gave her nothing to her liking and the
young died of starvation.
I am satisfied that the White Jackdaw is not an albino, nor an
artificial production like the White Java Sparrow, but a distinct
variety or race which breeds true to colour coming from the Continent;
but I have not been able to ascertain the locality whence those annually
imported actually come. Of course, mealworms, cockroaches, etc.,
would have saved these birds, and the plumage would have settled
the question. Several times with birds I have had an opportunity
which I have failed to avail myself of, and the opportunity has never

been offered again--a warning to my fellow-aviculturists. In succeed-
ing years the female Jackdaw would never allow the male to approach
her (one year she mated with a Chough, but the eggs were not fertile) ;
and I have had other instances where brother and sister obtained
a divorce :--was this accident, or a natural instinct to avoid inbreeding
and a degenerate progeny ?
The female Shama is now a common bird in this country, but
years ago it was as fabulous as the Roc, and many were the mysterious
reasons given for its non-appearance. I may mention, in connection
with the food question now being discussed in our pages, that my
first female died in a fit owing to the special food I used to have
prepared for my birds not having been sufficiently cooked. I have
long since ceased to give a servant an opportunity of killing my birds
by negligence. My next female I imported direct from Calcutta.
A pair of Shamas were sent over, but the male disappeared shortly
before the steamer entered the Thames. According to the official
report, it was killed by the rats. I examined the cage and found
that the rats could not possibly have got hold of it. A sovereign was
to have been paid to the butcher, the caretaker of all birds and beasts
on board ship, for each bird received alive ; but somebody had
evidently offered more than the sovereign, and so the butcher let the
" rats " have it. I mention this as there seems to be strong evidence
that this is not an uncommon occurrence when rare birds are imported
unaccompanied by a responsible person. However, the despised
female, of course the one I valued most, arrived safely on September
29th, 1892. On April 26th following, this bird, who was shut
up separately from a male, but in the same bird-room, commenced
carrying hay about. On May 5th it was clear that the birds wanted
to pair, when, on the following morning, a sad calamity occurred.
The male chanced to fly on to the front of his house when the old
Chinese Blue Pie, a very spiteful bird, who still survives, darted
down and tore off the centre toe of the left foot. Later in the month
the birds were introduced to the garden, and, on the 19th, both
were set free. The male's delight was unbounded ; and right bravely
did he disport himself before the lady of his love, but his bad foot
rather quickly cooled his ardour. As evening drew on, he went to
roost in a balsam poplar close to the side of the aviary, the female
not being far off. In the night I was awakened by one of the most
painful sounds I know, the cry as of a bird in the talons of a hawk.
With more speed than clothes, I rushed out. A cat had climbed up
the outside of the aviary, and the male, after the unfortunate manner
of birds in real or fancied peril, had flown on to the wire netting.
Years previously, however, I had learned by bitter experience that
a single wire is practically useless as a protection against cats. The
wires were double, and some three inches apart, one being of J in.

mesh. As an additional safeguard, the aviary was and is
surrounded by a cat's-claw protection ; and up to this point the cat
had climbed, but higher it could not go. So the Shama, although
within a foot of the cat, was safe ; the horrid eager look of the beast
I can picture to myself now, as it strained itself against the wire
between me and the sky ; and the poor bird was paralysed with
terror. I carried both of the Shamas back to the house, placing them
in the male's old home which would be familiar to his eye, but he
lay on the ground all night in an almost helpless condition. When
are our legislators going to mete out justice in the matter of cats !
Why should there be one law for the cat-owner and another for the
aviculturist ? What justice or reason is there in allowing people to
let their cats loose to trespass in other persons' gardens and feed on
their pets ? They should be required to keep their cats within their
own domains or to take the consequences.
As soon as the birds had recovered from the shock, once more
they were placed in the garden, and, more wise than before, they
roosted in safe places and were disturbed no more. Several times the
female commenced to build ; but the cold weather seemed to cause
much pain in the male's foot, or perhaps he had not recovered from
the cat scare ; anyway he was not responsive, and the nesting was
again and again discontinued. The place selected was on a shelf
nearly four feet from the ground, running along under a shed.
It transpired afterwards that two nests were built, about two feet
apart, in different partitions of the same shelf. In building, the plucky
little woman, who seemed fully to understand that her mate was
bad--a state of affairs which seldom fails to bring out the best qualities
in the sex--carried at first only dead leaves, chiefly ivy and euonymus,
the other available dead leaves being those of the rhododendrons,
which she would not touch ; she also took up straw and hay, finally
lining the second nest with the finest hay ; moss, hair, etc., she would |
not look at. The foundations of the nests were very large ; Robins'
and Redstarts' nests are often built on the same plan. In some
respects, perhaps, it was more like to the nest of the Nightingale than
to that of any other British bird. While all this was going on, the male
looked on approvingly, sang occasionally, and from time to time
made miserable the lives of an Australian Black-breasted Peewit,
another very old friend who still enjoys the best of health, and a
common Lapwing, the only other occupants of the aviary, who
eventually had to be removed. Judging from appearances, for I kept
away from the nest, the first egg was laid on June 6th, 1893, and
the female commenced to sit on the 9th, on four eggs as transpired
later.
On June 20th I noticed the female fly across the aviary from her
nest with something in her bill ; the male immediately darted at

her and seized the " something ", and a tug-of-war ensued. This
" something " turned out to be the first-born ; the excited mother
had by an accident carried out the nestling along with the shell, and
it was forthwith torn to pieces between the two birds and, if I recollect
rightly, devoured by them. Twice again that day and once on the
following morning did the female fly across the aviary to the same
spot bearing the discarded shells. For the first few days the young
were fed by the female, later by the male also. Not only did the
parents refuse to carry artificial food of any kind to the young, but,
as is too often the case, they themselves wholly gave up eating artificial
food ; and this circumstance adds greatly to the difficulty of rearing
a brood of insectivorous birds. It is impossible for me to obtain insects
here in London, and the young Shamas were reared on cockroaches,
mealworms, and gentles. I tried to breed "jumpers " in cheese, but
they were not appreciated. The gentles I discontinued after a time,
as they seemed to be more heating than the mealworms. At first
small cockroaches were taken to the nest from preference, but later
the mealworms were preferred. Unfortunately I could obtain but
a very limited supply of cockroaches, and had to rely mainly on
mealworms. The gentles and mealworms I placed in bran, in large
open saucers over a foot in diameter.
The three surviving young left the nest on 2nd July, well feathered
but unable to fly. The noise the two old birds made that day was
astounding, the female mad to entice the young away from the
adjoining aviary and its rapacious occupants (a Hunting Cissa being
especially desirous of " assisting " the mother), while the male, on
the highest perch, whistled defiance at the world. The more he
whistled, the more the neighbours crowded into the gardens around
(it happened to be Sunday) ; and the more they came the more the
bird whistled and sang.
In feeding the young, excepting quite at first, the parents would
not be bothered with carrying small creatures to their nest ; these
they swallowed, and carried only the larger ones. If I persisted in
supplying only small mealworms or cockroaches, they would not
budge until they had collected several of these in their bills. The
enormous cockroaches which I saw that female Shama give to her
young after they had left their nest would have convinced me, if
I had had need of convincing, of the needlessness of cutting up meal-
worms to give to young birds. The mouth of the young bird while
being fed was like the vortex of a whirlpool. The female would
endeavour to tilt a big cockroach head foremost into the open mouth :
if successful, it was caught in the vortex and disappeared in a twinkling ;
but if the insect happened to get crossways or was not caught fairly
in the vortex, it flew off at a tangent, and the performance had to
be gone through again.

A. A. PRESTWICH-THE SHAMA
I supplied the mealworms, etc., alive and uninjured, leaving it tp
the parents to kill them, which they did not always do by any means.
One reads that the parent Eagle shoves its young out of the eyrie
on the sides of the precipice, and then darts under the falling bird
for the purpose of supporting it in the air. This is sometimes regarded
as a pretty story and nothing more. Story or no story as regards the
Eagle, I can say that, as regards the Shama, on the day the young
left the nest, I saw the female several times, when trying to get them
on to perches in a shrub, fly under them and give them a partial
back-up.
Until the young left the nest, the parents kept up the delusion that
I did not know anything about it. They never went straight to the
nest, but every morsel of food was carried round the best part of
three sides of the aviary, almost precisely by the same route, a pause ,
usually being made at two points, and again just below the nest.
When the male, who usually performed the office, carried off the
excreta, he flew zig-zag hither and thither all over the place, dropping
them at the farthest possible point.
I need now only add that more delightful pets than these young
Shamas could not be, flying after me everywhere, and perching on
me anywhere they could find a footing.

THE SHAMA
HISTORICAL NOTES
By A. A. Prestwich
The Shama was first described by Gmelin in 1789. I cannot, how-

ever, find that it was known to aviculture before 1880, when some were
imported into Germany. It is possible that a few came to England
about the same time, but the earliest record I have is of two single
males deposited at the London Zoo in July and December, 1885.
This most famous of singing birds has always been in great demand,
but has never been very plentiful. Chapman used to receive con-
signments twice a year, and these often consisted of fifty or sixty birds,
all reputed to be hand-reared. This was sometimes far from the case,
as they were wild and rough.
The Shama is widely distributed in India, Burma, Ceylon, Siam, the
Malays, and China, and is divided into various races. The birds
usually imported were Indian or Malay, with a few from Java about
I932 '
Judging by the writings of some continental authors the Shama is

comparatively easy to breed and successes have been numerous, with
up to three broods in succession. Neunzig says they breed best in a
large bird-room, and that they have also been bred in a cage.
Continental aviculturists, more especially German, have in the past
obtained extraordinary results in bird-rooms, and they may have been
successful in breeding Shamas under these conditions, but in England
it has been found essential, if full success is to be obtained, to allow
the parents controlled liberty while they have young in the nest.
Even so, their breeding is by no means commonplace, and I have the
names of only eleven fully successful breeders, although several others
have come near to success.
Reginald Phillipps was, of course, the first, in 1893, as recorded
above. The next was probably the Rev. C. D. Farrar, who, in
Avicultural Magazine, 1903, 407, gives this bird in the list of the
species he had bred in the previous seven years. In connection with
this list Farrar, with his customary modesty, wrote " I fancy that the
list has never been beaten by one individual ".
Hubert Astley was successful in 1912, with nests of four and five
reared in quick succession (R.jV., 1912, 333 ; Avicultural
Magazine, 1912, 288). He had the parents and their nine young in
one aviary, and made the extraordinary mistake of leaving them
together during an absence abroad. The result was that the old male
killed four of his sons, and harried one or two of his daughters ; and
to complete the disaster the old female died during her moult.
Possibly the most successful breeder was G. E. Low, who in 1917
had eleven young ones reared in three nests by one pair. He has /
written fully on the successes and gave series of photographs of some
of the young ones at various ages in B.JV., 1917, 150, 204;
Avicultural Magazine, 1917, 266, 351 ; 1918, 137.
B. C. Thomasset was also very successful, rearing seven in 1929.
Other breeders to enjoy varying degrees of success during the past
twenty years are Captain R. Waud, A. Ezra, Mrs. K. Drake,
A. Sherriff, Dr. M. Amsler, and the Rev. O. E. Brooks.
There are at present just a very few Shamas in this country. It is
perhaps a little unlikely that any breeding results will be recorded, but
their owners are very experienced aviculturists, and one can be sure
it won't be for the want of trying.

Opening it, his eye fell right upon (of course) a bird--a bird. Yes, it's a large
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo. A microphone is before it and two men are listening
near. The bird is saying the words, " Any water." Surely, thinks our ailing member,
I can remember a Cockatoo at the Dublin Zoo that used to say " Any water " and
" Any amount of water ", but that's thirty years ago. Could it possibly be the
same one ? Away goes an Air Mail letter to the Head Keeper of the Zoological
Gardens, Phoenix Park, Dublin. Three weeks later back comes the reply, " Yes,
it is the same bird. He still says ' any water', broadcasts, and he is g8years of age ! "

A Pair of Rare Amazons at Whipsnade Zoo.
We now have amongst the inmates of our Parrot House two rarely imported
Amazons. The female I obtained from Palmer early in June and presented to the
Society, and the male has recently been purchased by the Zoo and is beginning to
settle down.
They were at first thought to be the Red-crowned Amazon ( Amazona rhodocorytha)
of South-east Brazil, but after examining the skins in the Bird Room of the Natural
History Museum, I have come to the conclusion that our supposed male Red-
crowned Amazon is really the Green-cheeked Amazon (. Amazona viridigena ) from
Eastern Mexico.
These two Amazon Parrots are very similar in plumage but vary slightly from
one another. There are seven specimens of rhodocorytha at the Natural History
Museum, which show a little variation on the head and hind neck. The Red-
crowned has not been represented in the Regent's Park collection for over ten years.
Miss Knobel tells me she had one in 1922, which she sold to Mrs. Dalton Burgess
for her Parrot collection, also Mr. Whitley has had it in his collection at Primley.
In the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1880, page 68, there is a coloured plate
of the head of this bird, when it was thought to be the young of Dufresne's Amazon.
The following is a description of rhodocorytha , taken from the British Museum
Catalogue of Birds , vol. xx, pp. 296-7 :--
Adult male. Green ; pileum, or the anterior part of it, red ; feathers of the occiput
and hind neck with brown-red or maroon edges ; lores yellow ; cheeks and throat
tinged with blue at the tips of the feathers ; a red speculum on the wings ; rest of
the wing as in C. dufresneana ; tail also like that of the last-named species, but the
lateral feathers have a red patch towards the tips of the inner webs ; upper mandible
whitish, reddish towards the base ; lower mandible horn-dusky ; feet yellowish
grey; iris orange-red. Total length 14-5 inches, wing 9, tail 4-7, bill 1*4, tarsus

secondaries ; red patches on the inner webs of the lateral tail-feathers towards the

Hybrid Macaws in the Edinburgh Zoo.
It may be of some interest to record the recent death of one of the three hybrid
Macaws in the Scottish Zoological Park of which I gave a short description last year
(A.M., 1947, pp. 66-7). The skin of this bird, a female with ovaries not in active
condition (? sterile), is at present under taxidermy at the Royal Scottish Museum and
is, I understand, to be forwarded to S. Kensington.
As there is some confusion at the Zoo over the specific identity of the father of. this
bird, it may be well for me to point out, as I did in the above-mentioned contribution,
that the male parent is a specimen of Ara chloroptera, not of A. macao as assumed in the
designation " Red and Blue Macaw ". Perhaps some time a note on the specific
differences between these two well-marked forms would make a welcome contribution
to some future " Parrot number ". But as someone at the B.M. may get busy on this

I sometimes wonder how often a novice breeds a really rare variety of Budgie, i
and it never comes to light until years later. Well, such has been the case with
our Crested Budgies. It all started back in 1939, when I had a small aviary with
a few choice pairs of birds which I was breeding under the controlled system, as j ;
a very good friend of ours started me off in the right way. That year we had appear
in our young a Whiteblue hen which had the cutest little crest somewhat like the
crest of a Gockatiel, but in miniature form. We did not think much about it, and
the next season we mated her with a Normal cock, and found that this time we had
some more Crested in both cocks and hens. We sold the babies just like normal
birds, and found that some people liked them very much, and we gave a friend j
of ours a pair of Crested Whiteblues which I believe she still has as cage pets. During
the war years we had to dispose of all of our birds, as we moved into our own home-- ]
that is my husband and I--and we could not get our large aviary moved, and I sold
all my Crested too. The breeders who got the Crested did not seem to realize their i
possibilities either, as they did not do much with them in the way of improvement,
and so when we started up in our birds again, we obtained some of our Crested j.
back again, and now we are experimenting with them, as we find them most interest-
ing. Last season we were working on the principle of breeding Crested to Crest-bred
the same as Crested Canaries, and we got the two types of Crested, the ones with
the little miniature Gockatiel crest and those with a crest like a Crested Canary
This season we decided to experiment further, so we tried breeding Crested to
Crested, and in this mating we got three types--the Cap Crest, the Canary Crest,
and also some which had the Canary crest in front and behind that a little miniature |
crest which it can raise and lower at will like a Gockatiel, and along the neck there j
is a mane of curled feathers.
We now have the Crested in Whiteblue, Cobalt, Skyblue, Cinnamonwings, and
White-wing Blues. Next season we will go into the Albinos, Lutinos, and Opalines
as well as the Yellow-wing Greens with our Crested factor, as there seems to be
a wide field of experimenting with these birds, and it is really fascinating to see
what the outcome of different matings will bring.
There used to be quite a few of the Crested Budgies in Vancouver, but we have
found that there is only the odd one here and there except for the ones which we
now have in our aviaries. In time they would have just vanished had we not taken

If ornithology can be considered to-day as the most developed
science of its kind, it is without doubt because, besides the " pure
scientists 55 who have undertaken patiently to explore this sphere, there
has always been an attraction for nature lovers towards the jewels
that are birds. It is certainly the origin of the large amount of informa-
tion given by the large collections and the innumerable small personal
observations.
As a consequence of this ornithology enters a new phase, on a
higher level. That where, after having described the species externally,
and having produced the maximum of generalization in that way,
one will have to analyse them internally. The work will have to be
done in greater depth and it is here that, more than ever, aviculture
can give its valuable aid, if the investigations are made in a
rational way. In fact, the study of bird behaviour is becoming
essential at the present time to confirm or refute the theories
previously set forth.
To study bird behaviour is, of course, more difficult than the descrip-
tion of their forms, colours, even some particular character. What
will be asked of aviculture is not only information about the special
habits of one subject or another, but to determine as completely as
possible the character of the species, let us say how behaviour corre-
sponds to their structure, the result of their composition.
It is from the moment work is rationally started in that direction
that aviculture will be able to give its full contribution.
A question of technical order immediately arises : that of the
methods to be used in order to reveal the series of characters pertaining
to one species.

178 J. P. DERSGHEID-THE MALE ROSY-BILLED DUCK
The methods will vary according to the information desired. If
this is of a psychological nature, for instance, I think such a result
can be obtained by placing the subject or better, the subjects representa-
tive of a species, in a series of different situations and conditions,
so that these will provoke in them some reactions which will divulge
the basis of the species' psychology.
On this line of investigation I thought it would be interesting to
relate some observations I have been led to make by the special
conditions in which two male Rosy-billed Duck are kept here. These
birds constitute the remains of the collection made at the " Armendy
Farm " by my father, Dr. J. M. Derscheid, and completely destroyed
during the war. They are therefore alone on a fairly large sheet of
water. Their isolation in such a situation decided me to settle some
points of their behaviour.
I shall relate the observations in the order of the increasing complica-
tion of conditions in which the subject has been placed.
The behaviour of the lonely male is not without interest. Let us
say first of all that the bird can be made very tame and to come very
near the people it recognizes. At the same time, though, it will never
get far from the banks. It likes, moreover, to choose a spot of the bank
and stay there for hours, its bill under its wing, but the eye vigilant.
One has often discussed the subject as to whether the surface feeding
ducks are, or are not, more intelligent than the diving ducks (Avic
Mag., May-June, 1942, pp. 69-79, etc.). Without giving any solution
to that problem, the discussion of which gives rise to very complex
questions, it is perhaps interesting to give an example here of the
initiative of a diving duck " which has forgotten how to dive ",
as say Messrs. Stevens. The Rosy-bill certainly possesses a good memory
of topology, and sufficient reasoning to lead him from one point to
another despite obstacles.
I had closed very carefully a small pond A where the bird par-
ticularly liked to go ; the bird which I had taken out and put ,
on the new pond B could not reach pond A except at point P
which necessitated it taking a long turning, as is shown in the diagram.
The next day I found it back on pond A : it had taken an indirect
route of 123 yards, along a wall W and a house H, instead of a direct
route of 3 yards, if this had been possible. One can see therefore it
was not lacking in sagacity. (See diagram on p. 179.)
As to its manner of feeding, one should not forget that the Rosy-
bill has an eminently aristocratic character, a Roman senator's
psychology, which prevents it from struggling too much. But any
person likely to give it some food is immediately remarked, even
at distances of the order of 100 yards ; though this might not seem
very extraordinary, I am not quite sure any other member of the tribe
would do likewise. But what is specific to the Rosy-bill is the way

it operates : it launches itself cleanly, and immediately takes
the right direction, straight to the target, without any hesitation
or distraction. Its speed is considerable for its size, and it
can go to 20 inches per second. Meanwhile the bird will keep its
dignity, the neck slightly bent forwards,
shaking its head laterally from time to time
as some people do to fit their collars.
When arrived at its destination, without
losing its calm, the drake delicately seizes
the piece of bread that has been thrown
in the water. It is certainly that purity
of movement and self-control that con-
stitutes one of the main attractions of this
Duck.
I have to say something about its
attitude in case of danger or surprise ;
when on the ground, the drake erects
its long neck vertically, giving inter-
mittently sudden short upward movements
of the bill and head. This precedes its
flying away. If it cannot fly, being
pinioned or injured, when pursued the
bird will run with small steps, its feathers
bristled up, its short tail opened in a fan,
and its bill half-opened.
On water, in case of surprise, the male
Rosy-bill will utter one of its two character-
istic notes. One I will try to describe as
a long deep and little sonorous " zweee-err ", during which it adopts
one of the two following positions : swimming swiftly away, the neck
erected vertically, or hunched up, motionless, swelling its feathers, its
head between its " shoulders ".
I shall finish the analysis of these conditions by saying that the drake
never dives like proper diving duck, such as Tufted ducks for instance,
except when it is incited to do so by the example of females of its
species, which seem to have kept the habit, or probably any diving
duck. Thus seldom will it dive spontaneously and then, as do the
surface feeding ducks, by forcing itself down gradually.
The male Rosy-bill does not hate the company of the male of the same
species, but the two specimens will not. give up a certain suspicion
and jealousy, even though with other ducks, they will keep to them-
selves. They will not fail, on the other hand, to provoke each other and
display. It is in such circumstances I have been able to discern their
two different notes : the two birds stopped suddenly on the water,
facing each other ; one ran wild, as far as dignity allowed it, stretching

its neck aggressively (see plate) and whistling its deep " hih-herr ",
while the other, keeping its temper, with still more dignity than his
rival, rolled itself up and swelled as much as possible, uttered the
" zweee-er " note mentioned above. Then, strained to the utmost,
they came nearer to each other, with retracted heads, touched one
another's flanks, and even bills, after which, as highly civilized beings
who understand the futility of a battle, they made away, satisfied
not to have given up. A good bath calmed their nerves.
I want to mention here the attitude of the bird in the paroxysm
of its display, though I only saw it once done with the intention of being
a rival : the drake, after having stretched its neck on the surface of the
water, throws it suddenly backwards and touches its back with the
top of it, as do the Goldeneyes.
With ducks of the species of the Mallard and its related domestic
races, the behaviour of the Rosy-bill will not always be the same :
towards the domestic bird, for instance, Khaki Campbells, it will not
show the least interest, but sometimes even a certain hostility. One
of its queer customs is to take advantage of their position when they
are head down and tail up, looking for food, to charge down on them.
It is the only occasion when it seems to lose its calm. Is it humour or
prudery ?
Towards the wild Mallards, I think it really has curiosity, if not
an attraction, which makes it mix up with them when they alight.
Strange enough, the contact with these birds seems immediately to
arouse its mistrust and savageness. After their departure, it will take
a time to bring back its confidence. I hope to relate some more observa-
tions on this handsome species a little later, as I shall be able, through
the kindness of Mr. Terry Jones, to provide my two solitary birds
with the mates for which they have been waiting for so long a time.

It is customary to call Swans the largest members of the waterfowl
family ( Anatida ). They have a long neck and short legs, are well
adapted to spending their active time on the water, in which they
feed on submerged plants and seed. They also eat grass and grain.
Swans look their best and are at their greatest ease on the water,
although they do not usually dive. They walk rather clumsily, but
they fly well.

All swans belong to one genus, Cygnus , and they really are nothing
but big, specialized geese. One curious South American species,
the Goscoraba, forms a link between the Swans and the Whistling
ducks, or Tree ducks. It is pure white with black tips to the wings,
a crimson bill and high, thick, crimson legs and feet. In habits as in
aspect, it recalls altogether the Swans and Whistling ducks. Their
chicks show faintly in white and pale grey the characteristic head-
markings of the young Whistling ducks.
There are in the world eight different sorts of swans which are
grouped in five species, as several are so closely related that they con-
stitute sub-species only. Five are pure white, one blackish grey,
another one white with black head and neck.
Swans are monogamous and pair for life. The female alone incubates
the eggs, with the exception of the Black Swan, the male of which
shares this duty with his mate. All male swans guard the nest and help
to rear the young. Eggs usually number four to six, but larger clutches
are not infrequent. Downy chicks are pale grey, and immatures show
a great deal of brownish grey in their plumage. Both sexes are alike
in colour ; the male is usually larger.
All the pure white Swans live in the northern hemisphere in cold or
temperate countries. The best known of these species is the Mute
Swan (Cygnus olor ), because it has long been half-domesticated, having
become a common denizen of ornamental waters all over the world.
It is particularly abundant and popular in England in a semi-feral
state. The Mute Swan is large and heavy (wing length 23J inches as an
average). It is easily recognized by the pinkish-orange bill and the
black knob on the forehead. Its habits and behaviour are well known,
particularly the way it raises the wings in anger and defiance, a posture
that only the Black Swan imitates. Contrary to the other white Swans,
it curves the neck gracefully. The voice is low and snorting, at times
shrill, but never trumpeting. In common only with the Black-necked
Swans of South America, Mute Swans have a habit of carrying their
chicks on the back, under their wings. In a wild state, the species
inhabits, or inhabited, northern and middle Europe, and central Asia
to south-eastern Siberia. It is only locally migratory. It probably
already occurred in England when it became semi-domesticated. As
it used to live in temperate districts, which soon became settled by man,
this tendency to domestication and its ornamental value have happily
saved the species from destruction in the more western parts of its
territory.
The other five white Swans, more primitive and goose-like, are all
very similar in shape, differing mostly in size and in the presence and
extent of yellow on their black bill. They are best considered as forming
two holarctic species, both having representatives throughout the
northern hemisphere. The two larger forms are the Whooper of

Europe and Asia (Cygnus cygnus cygnus ), and the Trumpeter of North
America (Cygnus cygnus buccinator ). The smaller group includes the
North American Whistler (Cygnus columbianus columbianus), Bewick's
(Cygnus columbianus bewickii) of northern Europe and north-eastern Asia,
and Jankowski's (Cygnus columbianus jankowskii) of eastern Siberia. They
all have similar habits. They do not raise their wings but spread them
laterally in anger, and they move their heads up and down with a
sinuous and brusque motion of the neck. They often call and their
voice is bugle-like, the larger Trumpeter having a loud, deep tone, the
Whooper a clearer ring, the Whistler a high pitch, and Bewick's Swan
a softer note.
To give an idea of their respective sizes, here is the average size of
their wing tips :--
Inches.

An adult male Trumpeter weighs some 30 pounds, while a Bewick's
is under 15. The Trumpeter and the Whooper have a proportionally
longer bill, neck, and body ; they have a complicated, circumvoluted
windpipe. The three smaller Swans are cobbier and rounder; their
neck is shorter and their windpipe shorter and simpler. Trumpeter
Swans (the largest of all) used to live in great numbers in western and
mid-western North America. They have now been reduced to about
1,000 by indiscriminate shooting in the recent past, but they are slowly
coming back since protection has been afforded to them. Their last
stronghold in the United States is Red Rock Lakes, Montana, and the
neighbouring country, including the Yellowstone National Park.
A project is now operating to increase the population under control
and re-establish the species in some parts of its old territory. Trumpeters
migrate only locally in search of food and open water. They proved to
be easy to rear in captivity in suitable climates. The principal charac-
teristics are the completely black, long, and powerful bill, and the deep,
loud voice.
Whooper Swans breed from Greenland to Japan, migrating in
winter to the warmer parts of southern Europe, North Africa, Asia
Minor, Persia, and northern India. They still are rather numerous
and they also breed well in captivity. Smaller and lighter than
Trumpeters, they differ markedly in the colours of the bill, which is
bright yellow from the forehead to beyond the nostrils. Whoopers and
Trumpeters will interbreed easily.
Whistling Swans are still common. They nest in Arctic America and

spend the winter in the southern United States, being highly migratory.
Their rather short bill is black, usually with two yellow spots near the
base, which are sometimes lacking. There are no records of their
breeding in captivity, but hybrids with the Whooper have been
obtained.
Bewick's Swans much resemble the Whistlers, but they have a big
yellow patch at the base of the bill, rounder and smaller than in the
Whoopers. They nest in Arctic Russia and western Siberia, migrating to
western, central, and southern Europe, and east to India. Very similar,
Jankowski's Swans are larger, with a little more yellow on the bill, and
replace them in eastern Siberia, wintering in Japan and China. Both
these Swans have bred in captivity on rare occasions. They still exist
in large numbers in their Arctic haunts. The so-called David Swan,
the type of which has been lost, is probably an immature jankowskii.
Black-necked Swans (Cygnus melancoriphus) inhabit the cold and
temperate parts of South America. They are beautiful birds, the size
of Bewick's Swans, but longer and slimmer in shape, white with black
head and neck. The blue-grey bill is surrounded by a big crimson
caruncle, and they have long and narrow white eyebrows. These fine
swans breed well in confinement. For over fifteen years in my park at
Gleres a pair reared every year three or four young, which they carried
on the back most of the time during the first two weeks. The voice is
a musical whistle.
Australian Black Swans (Cygnus atratus), which have been
acclimatized in New Zealand, are a dark, mottled, blackish-grey, with
white flight feathers. They have a very long neck and the bill is a
brilliant crimson. The wing-coverts are wavy in shape and they raise
them when they are excited, as do the Mute Swans. Their voice is a
high-pitched, modulated bugle. They breed freely in captivity, both
sexes incubating, a habit which the Whistling ducks only share with
them within the whole waterfowl family. Only very occasionally the
cygnets are carried on their parents' back.
In the wild state Swans live in flocks during the autumn and winter,
but when the spring nesting season approaches, breeding birds separate
in pairs that jealously guard their chosen territory. According to
species and habitat, this territory may vary from a few square yards
(as can be seen in the Abbotsbury Swannery, Dorset) to many acres.
A large territory is the more normal case. In defence of this domain,
male Swans will fight furiously, and the stronger bird often drowns the
loser. The combative habit is reinforced in captivity to the point that
angry Swans positively become dangerous to children. Unless the
area where they are kept is very extensive, it becomes necessary to
isolate each pair on a pond or in a pen. Unmated birds, however, live
amicably together the year round. I see every summer at Red Rocks
Lakes fifty or sixty such non-breeding Trumpeters in a bunch,

although they look quite adult. There is no doubt that the lack of
available nesting space prevents them from establishing a home and
raising a family. To-day, the housing shortage is not the exclusive
privilege of human beings . . .
Trumpeters are very jealous and pugnacious, and each breeding
pair appropriates a large area where no other Swans, or even Geese,
are tolerated. I have long known the hot temper of Trumpeters
through experience in captivity. Some I once had free in the park at
Cleres became so savage that they would run up the hills chasing White
Rheas, which they stupidly considered competitors just because they
were also large white birds. This propensity of all birds to believe that
individuals of their own colour and pattern are competitors, therefore
enemies, is particularly in evidence with Swans. It is even more
important to them than similarities in shape, size, and habits. At
liberty and in semi-captivity, where birds can also display their true
natural behaviour, I have noticed it time after time. White Swans will
persecute Snow Geese in preference to other Geese which, however, are
also attacked. Black-necked Swans show a particular hatred for
European Sheld-ducks because they also possess a black head and neck
and much white in the plumage. Black Swans dislike especially dark-
coloured Geese. It is important to remember this when Swans are to be
associated with other species of waterfowl. They usually ignore and
leave alone the smaller Geese, Sheld-ducks, Ducks, and Teal, although
nesting pairs may kill even ducklings. It is all a question of space and
also of the individual temperament of each bird. My breeding Black-
necked Swans never bothered much about ducks, and very prolific
pairs of Blacks, which used to attack me savagely, lived in perfect peace
with Paradise Sheld-duck, wild Muscovies, and all sorts of ducks.
Others would murder anything alive which ventured to approach them.
Non-breeding birds are not dangerous, however, and when it is
desired to keep a number of Swans together for show on a moderate-
sized lake with other waterfowl, I would recommend what I had done
at Villers-Britonneux in Picardy, my old place that was destroyed in
1918. I had there on a pond for many years a dozen Swans of various
species, all females. They looked just as fine as males, and they lived
in complete peace. In public zoos, where it often becomes a problem
to manage swans on small artificial lakes, I would recommend the use
of females only. The sex can often be recognized by the size and
behaviour of the birds, and it is easily proved by the examination of the
reproductive organs.
The future of Swans in the modern world would be dark indeed if
adequate conservation measures were not taken in time. The breeding
haunts in the Far North of the Whistler, Whooper, Jankowski's, and
Bewick's, until lately inaccessible, are now being intruded upon and
disturbed. This is a very serious threat. Their nesting territories

should be properly preserved and made safe for them. Otherwise, they
will soon dwindle down and disappear, even if sufficient protection is
afforded them during migration and in their winter quarters. There is
no time to waste in organizing the protection of northern waterfowl in
the Arctic regions. The Trumpeters and the Mutes, which breed
farther south in territories now settled by human beings, have con-
sequently disappeared from most of their former range. They would
have been entirely wiped out if semi-domestication and local protection
had not saved in time what remained of them. But their position is not
yet satisfactory. The Black Swan is holding his own in the marshes of
Australia, where it enjoys some measure of protection and it now
abounds in New Zealand. But the situation of the Black-necked Swan,
and also that of the strange Goscoraba, is causing worries. During the
war they had been much persecuted for their skin, the downy parts of
which were used for powder puffs, while the domestic goose skins,
usually employed, could not be shipped from Europe. It is to be
hoped that the slaughter has now ceased, but our Argentine and
Chilean friends are strongly urged to adopt measures for the con-
servation of these two fine species before they are too far gone.
Zoological gardens and private bird farms have also their part to
play in saving the Swans by establishing under control an adequate
breeding stock of all the species and sub-species.

By H. Manfield (Head Keeper of Birds)
My reason for writing of the breeding of the Ruddy Sheld-duck
{Tadorna casarca) is to know just when is a duck too old to breed and
lay fertile eggs, or whether any reader has had a duck produce young
when more than 15 years old. Domestic ducks are usually not con-
sidered profitable after about four years. The pair on which I am about
to write were imported by the above Gardens from Mr. R. Stevens, of
Walcot Hall, England, about the year 1933 ; the age of the birds
then was not known to me. A pair of Cape Sheld-ducks (Tadorna cana)
arrived about the same time (I remember the two pairs arrived in
perfect condition), and of this pair the male is still living ; the female
died only last year, 1947. The pair of Ruddy never looked like
breeding in spite of everything tried ; they were even placed on the
largest pond we have, the Flamingo enclosure, and fed on a special
laying mash with boiled minced liver added, and often fed warm.
But nothing ever happened, and in the year 1944 the male, having
gone blind, died and was thought then to have lived to a good age for
a duck. So it looked as though Adelaide Zoo would never breed
Ruddy Sheld-ducks, as there were not any others in Australia that
we knew of; but to our surprise in 1945 the Director, Mr. V. Haggard,
who was on a visit to Melbourne, Victoria, and called on one of our
old and esteemed bird friends, a Mr. Alan Jacques, of Bolwyn (by the
way, I called on him last year and he told me he was nearly ninety
years old and still well and attending his birds), and found a solitary
Ruddy, and a male too. Mr. Haggard was able to secure it by exchange
and soon it was railed to Adelaide and placed in the pen with the
duck ; but she was not very friendly and had to be separated and we
thought at first they were two of a kind. But still they did not look
alike, so after a few days were again introduced to each other and
later settled down and turned out a good pair. Still nothing happened
until spring--in fact; the end of spring, 1946, when one day, to my
surprise, I noticed the duck coming out of a rock-nest we had made
while the male stood looking on. Later I made an investigation and
noticed a hollow scratched out. A couple of days later I discovered
she had laid her first egg; then three were seen ; looking later
I discovered there was only one egg left ; this told us rats had found
the nest and were eating the eggs. This, of course, proved very
disappointing, and we had to try and find out some way of removing

the eggs as they were laid, and at the same time try and get the duck
to sit. Then I dropped on an idea which might work, and did prove
successful. I had a nest of Muscovy eggs that a duck had sat on for
about seven weeks, and placed three of the old eggs in the Ruddy's
nest. Next day the fresh egg was removed and the rats started on
the old eggs ; you can imagine the smell, it was just terrific ; and
I was afraid the Sheld-duck would not return to the nest. However,
she continued to lay, and as the rats broke the bad eggs they were
replaced, as I had quite a few in a nest. The duck went on until
eleven were laid and then began to line the nest with down, so the
bad eggs were removed and the good eggs put back, and the rats
never came back to disturb her again. All went well, and after about
30 days two young left the nest with the proud parents. On looking
in the nest I discovered a third egg chipped, but it died from exposure,
and all other eggs were infertile. The two ducklings were successfully
reared and turned out a true pair. Next year, 1947, the duck laid
again ; this time nine eggs were laid, of which three hatched and six
were infertile, and the young reared again ; the rats never came back
egg-eating. The young turned out this time to be three females,
making our flock now two males and five females, which is certainly
much more encouraging than in 1944, when it looked like our Ruddy
Sheld-ducks dying right out. This year, 1948, the pair look as fit as
ever, and providing our winter is not too severe with frosts--as the
water on the ponds often has ice a quarter of an inch thick--should
be all right. The young are very easy to rear and do well on
a food made up with oatmeal, hard-boiled egg pushed through a sieve,
a little raw minced meat chopped very fine, and lettuce cut up. The
young spend much time on the water catching flies, etc. When a
month old they are given a mash made with bran and pollard, with
a little meat meal added with a little wheat fed in the water. The
young are pinioned when they are just hatched and leave the nest,
it is much more humane when done so young, and they do not even
bleed. The enclosure is about 16 feet wide and 40 feet deep, with
a pond 6 feet in diameter, and flowering plum trees provide shade
in the summer. I may say here that the Ruddy Sheld-duck is a most
charming bird and is much admired by visitors, and it will be
interesting to see just how long this duck will live and go on producing
young. This reminds me of what an old friend always says, " that
birds will not always have the mates we provide for them," and it
proved right in the case of Ruddy's first mate.

ECLIPSE PLUMAGE AND NUPTIAL PLUMAGE

insignificant ashy or grey-brown to the most elaborate composition
of colour, form, and pattern. Either extreme, the inconspicuous
plumage or the ornamental one, is &amp;apos;worn throughout the whole year
by those species that moult only once annually. Such birds moult
from one inconspicuous plumage to another or from one colourful
one to another. No experimental experience is so far available that
would indicate whether birds of such species are able to develop
a different type of plumage under special conditions.
Another large group of species of ducks, and this includes all the
Palearctic River Ducks, moults twice annually. The males wear
a colourful ornamental plumage part of the year and an inconspicuous
eclipse plumage during the rest of it. One is inclined to consider the
simple eclipse plumage as the " normal " plumage of the species
since both female and juvenile plumages are very similar to it. The
ornamental plumage of the male would then have to be considered
as a temporary specialization of the normal condition. Experiments,
however, have shown that actually the opposite is true. It is the orna-
mental plumage which is genetically fixed, and it requires a hormonal
inhibition in order to change it into the eclipse plumage.
The significance of the ornamental and the eclipse plumages as
nuptial and protective plumages is obvious. One might therefore
presume that the normal condition among ducks would be to have an
ornamental plumage during the breeding season (May to August)
and to be camouflaged throughout the greater part of the year by an
eclipse plumage. This condition is realized in the Ruddy Duck
(Oxyura jamaicensis ), and the Cotton Teal (JVettopus coromandelianus ),
but not in any other species. On the contrary, by far the majority
of species of ducks wear the ornamental plumage throughout the
greater part of the year. It almost looks as if the drake " wants 55
to wear the species 5 specific ornamental plumage as long as possible
and to have it replaced only during the &amp;apos;short period when this is
really needed. This is the time when all the wing feathers are shed
simultaneously and the birds are unable to escape by flight. It is
during this period that there is a great selective advantage in being
completely inconspicuous.
The period of the losing of the wing feathers is obviously the most

important event in the moult of the ducks, since the wing is the most
essential portion of the whole plumage. The wing feathers must be
of very solid construction and require a great deal of material. Their
growth constitutes therefore a considerable drain upon the bird's
reserves. The feathers of the wing are therefore formed only once
a year. There can be little doubt that the wings belong to the orna-
mental plumage. At any rate, it appears absurd to assume that the bird
would wear an eclipse wing in its highly evolved specific plumage.
If such were the case the bird would never have a complete e&amp;lt; nuptial
dress The period during which the body produces sub-standard
eclipse feathers cannot possibly be also that of the growth of the
wing feathers. One may safely assume that it is during the days
of the wing moult that the change occurs which enables the body to
produce feathers of the ornamental type, while immediately before
that it produced only eclipse feathers. The moult into the ornamental
plumage often follows very soon that into the eclipse plumage. This
means that the efficacy of the hormone which causes the body to
produce eclipse feathers ends at the moment at which the wing feathers
begin to develop.
The Moult of the Old Squaw
The facts reported above will now be applied to the moult of the
Old Squaw. This species appears to be different from all other ducks,
since it is reputed to have three or even four different plumages in the
course of a single year. F. Salomonsen {Journal fiir Ornithologies 1941,
p. 283) states : " The moult of the Old Squaw is highly peculiar ;
there is no other duck that has a sequence of plumages of equal
complexity."
The ornamental plumage of Clangula hyemalis is the plumage worn
in winter which is characterized by a white head and neck and white
scapulars. This was definitely established by Sutton in his study of
this species {Auk, 1932, pp. 42-51). The following parts of this orna-
mental plumage are moulted in April or May (i.e. before the breeding
season) and replaced by eclipse feathers : the scapulars and all, or
a considerable part, of the plumage of the head and neck down to the
breast. Following this there is a three-month pause in the moult.
Late in July or early in August (i.e. after the breeding season), this
moult is continued and the remaining white feathers of the head and
neck are replaced by dark ones and the white " wing-pouch 551 is
replaced by dull, grey eclipse feathers. The four elongated scapulars
are moulted once more ; they are replaced by feathers which are
duller, blunter, shorter, and weaker than those grown in the spring.
1 " Wing-pouch " is suggested as an English equivalent of the German " Trag-
federn " for the long feathers of the sides of the breast and flanks jwhich cover and
protect the folded wing in order to keep it dry.

190 V. STRESEMANN-THE OLD SQUAW, OR LONG-TAILED DUCK
A few of the smaller scapulars are also moulted at this period. 1 This
is followed by the moult of the wing feathers and of the whole remainder
of the plumage behind below the breast line, including the tail with
its two much-elongated central feathers. After some while all eclipse
features are changed for ornamental feathers.
The moult can be summarized as follows :
Moulted once a year. --The entire plumage posterior to the breast
line, except scapulars and " wing pouch ", i.e. back, breast, belly,
tail, upper and under tail coverts, and the wing.
Moulted twice a year. --All parts of the plumage in front of the breast
line, i.e. head and neck, upper back and upper breast, also " wing
pouch ", and some of the smaller scapulars.
Moulted three times a year. --The four elongated scapulars and part
of their smaller ones.
The only feather tract that produces three different generations of
feathers in a single year is thus that in which the elongated scapulars
are rooted. This is indeed a peculiar, and so far as known a unique, excep-
tion. Together with the interruption of the moult in June, it has led
to the idea that the drake Old Squaw has three different plumages
(see Schioler, 1926, and Lonnberg, 1926).
The resumption of feather growth after a period of interrupted
moult does not mean at all that a new plumage is assumed. The period
during which the change of plumage must be completed does not seem
to have any definite limitation. Many of the Palaearctic migrants, for
example, divide their principal moult into two periods. They moult
part of their plumage (usually the entire body plumage) before migra-
tion, while the remainder of the plumage (usually wing and tail
feathers) is not moulted until several weeks later in the winter quarters
(as in Hirundo , Delichon , and Riparia). One should therefore use the
formal term " plumage " only for that dress in which are combined
all feathers of equal physiological composition which the body is able
to produce. If one wants to give a name to the spring stage in the
moult of the Old Squaw, one can use the term " semi-eclipse "
plumage, coined by Millais in 1913, 2 for we are dealing here
with a half-finished eclipse plumage which is not completed until
July or August (Sutton, Auk, 1932). Leaving the scapulars out of
consideration one can say that only those feathers are moulted in
summer that had been " forgotten " in spring. The change of
colouring of head and neck is completed in those individuals in which
this did not occur in spring. At this stage also the " wing pouch ",
until now composed of light ornamental feathers, is moulted because
1 A good coloured illustration of this plumage stage is found in Schioler, 1926,
plates 21 and 32 ; also in Lonnberg, Fauna och Flora , 1927, Heft 1.
2 Millais, however, applied this term to the complete eclipse-plumage as
acquired in July/August.

" V. STRESEMANN THE OLD SQUAW, OR LONG-TAILED DUCK 1 9 1
the moult of the wing feathers is now impending. " Wing pouch "
and scapulars are " those feathers which--newly perfected and
cryptically coloured--take over the protection of the wing when this
has lost all of its flight feathers and coverts and is densely covered with
sensitive pin feathers " (Stresemann, 1940, p. 297).
This fact gives us perhaps an explanation for the existence of three
feather generations in the scapular tract. Since the loss of the wing
feathers is a most decisive event for a bird, and since the proper care
of the wing is immensely important, it becomes obligatory for the
scapulars to moult in preparation for the impending moult of the wing.
Undoubtedly the primary moulting period of the scapulars is in
August after the breeding season and immediately before the loss of the
wing feathers. It is thus the second generation of scapulars, that is
formed in the spring, which is the exception, and not the third. The
appearance of the feathers supports this assumption. The feathers of
the second generation still resemble in form those of the ornamental
plumage ; only the colour and length indicate some inhibition. The
advancement of the beginning of moult to before the breeding season
is the particular phenomenon which distinguishes the Old Squaw
from all other species of ducks. The advantage of darkening the
plumage before the return into the breeding territory is explained by
Sutton as correlated with a change from " ice-filled bays " to " rock-
rimmed inland ponds 55 (Sutton, p. 45). If it is this need for protective
coloration which releases the spring moult, it becomes apparent
why the scapulars are changed. These white stripes on the dark back
are undoubtedly the most conspicuous features of the bird. In the
course of the year there are thus two special reasons for a moult of
the scapulars ; in spring because the bird must now appear all dark,
in summer because the proper period has now come for that moult of
the scapulars which precedes the wing moult. The spring moult does
not affect the " wing pouch " because it is not essential that it is
darkened. On the second occasion (post-breeding moult), however,
the " wing pouch 55 is involved because of the linkage of its moult with
that of the wing feathers. All the feather tracts of the bird, including
those of the wings, react to the main moulting stimulus of the year
which provides the ornamental plumage.
Salomonsen's opinion that the change of the feathers of the back,
abdomen, wings, and tail still belongs to the moult into the eclipse
plumage is without a doubt erroneous (all feathers which grow after
Salomonsen's stage S.D. belong to the ornamental plumage). The
beautiful white and the blackish-brown feathers of the under parts surely
do not grow under the influence of an hormonal inhibition. The
elongated central tail feathers do not fit at all into an eclipse plumage.
Such feathers are, in all species of birds which are thus adorned, the
most conspicuous character of an ornamental plumage.

192 V. STRESEMANN-THE OLD SQUAW, OR LONG-TAILED DUCK
Salomonsen considers that a " breeding plumage 55 (our semi-
eclipse plumage) follows the ornamental plumage which is worn
through the winter. This plumage is indeed worn throughout the
breeding season, but the name is misleading since in birds 44 breeding
plumage " has always been used synonymously with 44 nuptial or
ornamental plumage We cannot concur with Salomonsen's opinion
that this semi-eclipse plumage and, in particular, the markings of the
head have a significance in courtship (hence Salomonsen's term
" nuptial plumage "). The heads of all ducks seem to moult in such
a manner that the growth of feathers proceeds from definite
lines gradually over a definite area. Salomonsen himself describes
this very succinctly (p. 289) : 44 The spots on the sides of the neck push
themselves forward under the eyes." Only if the feathers moult from
white to black, the lines of feather growth appear for short periods
but disappear again with progressive moult. (It is not true that the
striping of the head appears and then the moult makes a pause.)
A hormonally-controlled plumage, such as that into which the
drake Old Squaw moults in the spring, leaves a great range to
individual variation. It is therefore risky to interpret details of
this pattern as having a specific intentional function. The number
of white feathers on the head and neck which the drake may
wear into the summer varies greatly. In some birds, all the white
feathers are already replaced by dark ones by the beginning of May,
as is shown in the Berlin Museum in exemplary fashion by a drake
killed on 9th May, 1936, at Rossitten. Salomonsen figures an equally
dark head of a specimen taken 3rd May. At present it cannot be
decided whether the degree of completion of the eclipse plumage in
spring depends on the hormonal level or on the age of the individual.
One can assume, however, that old drakes undergo a more complete
moult in spring than younger ones. The younger specimens tend in
all species of ducks to carry over feathers from one plumage into the
next. The later in life a duck becomes sexually mature the more
numerous are the stages between juvenile and adult plumage (f.i.
Eider Duck). We may accordingly expect to find in the Old Squaw
many 4 4 mixed " individuals, since it is one of those species which do
not reproduce until their third year.
Could not this be the explanation for the 44 fourth plumage " or
44 fall plumage " described by Salomonsen ? In our opinion, such
drakes in 44 fall plumage " must be young birds. They could be either
birds in the first winter that already acquire the brown breast shield
of the fully adult drake but not yet the complete patch on the sides
of the neck, or birds in the second winter that still retain the juvenile
colour of the patch on the sides of the neck. Salomonsen (p. 323) says
of the moult into the first winter plumage : 44 The juvenile feathers of
the underside always remain unmoulted, only a few scattered feathers of

V. STRESEMANN-THE OLD SQUAW, OR LONG-TAILED DUCK 1 93
the upper breast may be exchanged for new black-brown ones, but a
brown breast shield is never attained." How can we know this ? How
can we know that with the moult into the second winter plumage " every
difference between young and adult birds disappears 55 ? (Salomonsen,
p. 325.) According to Salomonsen himself (p. 327) females in the second
winter still differ from adult ones. Furthermore, if we ask for what reason
the birds should attain a special fall plumage on the head, it would be
exceedingly difficult to find an answer. If the faintly indicated patch
on the sides of the neck really indicates a moulting stage passed through
by all birds every fall, then the dark feathers on the neck of the eclipse
plumage would have to be replaced by white ones and these again
at once by black ones, and all this within a period of not more than
four weeks. It is hard to believe that the drake would indulge in this
unreasonable luxury at the time of the wing growth when all
the available energy is required for the formation of the wing feathers.
We do not believe in a special fall plumage in the Old Squaw, for
which there seems to be no biological justification.
All that has been said so far about moults and plumages refers to
the drake of Clangula. The females like the males moult into the eclipse
plumage in two stages. They likewise begin in April or May to acquire
a darker plumage, and after a pause continue with this around the
end of July to early August. The scapulars likewise have three genera-
tions of feathers each year. 1 The interruption of the moult in the
females is even longer owing to preoccupation with incubation and
the care of the young.
We refrain from using for the female Old Squaw the terms
proposed by E. Stresemann (1940) for the plumages of female ducks
(" breeding plumage ", " resting plumage ") since they would lead to
confusion in this species. The use of the terms " ornamental " and
" eclipse " plumage used by Salomonsen is as justified in the ducks
as in the drake of this species since the two plumages of the female
are clearly different.
Summary
The sequence of plumages in the Old Squaw does not differ
materially from that of other species of ducks. The male has an
ornamental and an eclipse plumage like all ducks with a double moult.
The eclipse plumage is attained in two stages which are separated
by a cessation of moult. The first of these stages of moult into the
eclipse plumage is in spring (April to June) before the breeding season.
1 A good coloured illustration of the female in complete eclipse plumage (8th August),
with dark brown-grey wing pouch and with the short scapulars, has been published
by Lonnberg in Fauna och Flora , 1926, no. 5. Females in semi-eclipse plumage only
(still with white wing pouch) are shown on plate 30 of Schioler, 1926.

In July and August the moult into the eclipse plumage is continued
and completed. The moult into the ornamental plumage follows
almost immediately.
The Old Squaw differs from all other ducks so far investigated by
annually having three separate generations of the four elongated
scapulars (and of some smaller ones). An intermediate type is
grown in spring which is worn during the period between the loss of
the long white scapulars of the ornamental plumage and the acquisi-
tion of the short brown ones of the full eclipse plumage. This is the
only unique feature in the moult of the Old Squaw.
The so-called " fall plumage 55 of Salomonsen is interpreted as
a plumage of immature drakes. The females are like the males as
regards the stages of the moult and the three generations of scapulars.

The spring of 1948 was a poor one for waterfowl breeders in the
eastern United States as it seems to have been elsewhere. The unusually
cold winter with its heavy continuous snowfall was followed by a
much delayed spring. In Connecticut there was over 100 inches of
snow, and the ice was not off the ponds until the end of March.
High pressure areas with accompanying cold winds were the rule
through a good part of April. The alternating lows were accompanied
with heavy rains and cloudy conditions. As a result of all this, breeding
among captive birds got off to a slow start and was unusually
spasmodic. Many birds were observed displaying and breeding
which still failed to make nests or lay.
The only breeder who seems to have been unaffected by this state
of affairs was Mr. Mackensen, of Yardley, Pennsylvania, who
succeeded in having an excellent season. His son has reported to me
that the first indications were inauspicious. Dogs broke into the
Mackensen breeding pens during the winter and killed all but seven
duck. Consequently they had to depend entirely on birds of the year
which had been raised the previous spring. In spite of this handicap,
the almost continual rain, and the difficulty due to the rain that
many duck had in building and maintaining nests, young were
successfully reared in the following species : Wood Duck, Mandarin,
Pintail, Redhead (Pochard), Gadwall, American Wigeon, and
Cinnamon Teal. In addition Canada, Egyptian, and Magellan
Geese reared young and Black Swan also.

My friend Mr. Livermore, of Redding, Conn., a member of the
Society, found, as I did, that his principal problem was infertility of
eggs. Presumably this must partly be attributed to the season.
Although he had eggs from a large number of species, his collection
must be one of the most comprehensive in the country, few hatched
and of these even fewer were reared. Among the more interesting of
these were Wild Muscovy Duck and Australian Mallard, and among
the geese Western Canadas, Blue Snow, and Egyptians. The rain
continued well into the rearing season and wrought havoc among
young Woods and Mandarin, which we find here very sensitive to
thunder showers in their first week or ten days.
As this has been my first season of using a larger pond, I am still
in an experimental stage as regards rearing. Vermin, primarily Grows,
accounted for every one of my young ducks which I attempted to
allow the mothers to rear themselves. Again, Crows were responsible
for a deal of nest robbing, and infertility did the rest. As usual the
least wanted were the most successful, and I am now the proud
possessor of eight young Mallard x Indian Spotbill cross ! Two
incidents of interest may bear telling here. I have had a small flock
of Cackling Geese, the miniature Aleutian Island population of the
common Canada Goose, for some time. There has always been a
single Cackling gander which has stayed most of the time by himself,
only occasionally flocking with his six relatives. After the breeding
season I placed on the pond an old mated pair of Barnacles, not
having had any of that species previously on the pond. The Barnacles
were naturally rather frightened and swam about by themselves for
a time while other species of Geese passed them in disdain or
occasionally called and gestured threateningly. Suddenly my solitary
Cackling saw them and, swimming up, proceeded to attack the
female Barnacle and to mate swiftly and efficiently with her. The old
Barnacle gander was a little distance away and apparently too dazed
to come to his mate's assistance. Later, however, he must have
established his supremacy for the Cackling is again solitary.
By chance I happened to watch a pair of Ringneck Duck (an
American Pochard) mate on the pond and was astonished to observe
the male, after copulation, leave the duck's back by springing into
the air a short distance directly out of the water, an unexpected and
exuberant gesture not related in any way to the normal display.

196 TERRY JONES-THE ANDEAN CRESTED DUCK
THE ANDEAN CRESTED DUCK
{Anas cristata alticola)

<bodyText confidence="0.99894905" page_id="56311638"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
The chequered history of this pair of duck is perhaps worth record-
ing. Alastair Morrison arrived in England in 1939 with a number of
waterfowl which he had Collected in South America. Amongst
the birds was this Northern race of the Crested Duck which he had
collected in the Peruvian highlands. Mr. Lewis bought a pair for his
collection at Leckford and others went to Dr. Derscheid and to
Monsieur Delacour at Cleres. Our female died before the war and
our male during the war was inadvertently sold to Lilford and, thanks
to Mr. Moody, returned to us.
When I came back here after the war we still had the male bird
and as there now seemed no hope of getting him a mate I felt he would
be of more use to the London Zoo than to me, so off he went to terrorize
their pond. In the summer of 1947 Monsieur Delacour came to
England and to France. In the Paris Zoo he saw a female Crested
Duck, his female, so he persuaded the authorities to send her here,
and Dr. Vevers let me have our male back.
Then my troubles began. Neither bird had seen its own species for
nine years. The drake was convinced he was a Chilean Teal and the
duck that she was a Snow Goose. Each bird completely ignored the
other and consorted with its adopted relations.
They were turned out in the main enclosure with all the peace-
loving waterfowl, in spite of Dr. Vevers's warnings about the drake's
temper. I was anxious to breed them, as they had not previously
been bred in captivity and I wanted them to have the best possible
chance of doing so. Monsieur had told me that when Cleres was
overrun by the Germans the duck had been sitting. As I have said,
they ignored each other though both were anxious to obtain mates.
I therefore caught them up and put them in a pen by themselves.
For a long time they kept as far apart as possible and should the
duck come near the drake she was savagely attacked. Months went
by and I began to despair of mating them. Then I noticed the duck
nervously and always at a safe distance courting the drake. Very
slowly he took to her and once they were devoted to each other
I again turned them out into the main enclosure.
The Crested Duck is a curious species, one minute behaving like
a Mallard, and the next like a Sheld-duck. I will now try and describe
in detail some of these actions. The typical call note, used, for example,
when calling to flighting Mallard, is very similar in the case of the
female to the call of the duck Chestnut-breasted Teal. The " quacks "
have the same spacing and the same slight cadence--" aap-aap-

apapap," The voice, however, is distinctly deeper. The drake's
call is the&amp;apos;same as the duck's in form, but his voice is a rather windy
whistle. The duck is much given to " nattering ", an endless series of
short grumbling notes, when a person she likes is near or when her
mate is creating hell for all around her. The duck's note when courting
her mate is very similiar to the note a common Sheld-duck uses on
similar occasions. The Sheld-duck swims by - her mate, uttering a
series of " arrups ", while stretching her neck along the water and at
each note slightly raising the angle of her head and beak. The Grested
Duck carries her neck stretched upwards with her beak rather below
a right angle. At intervals the duck utters the note similar to the
Sheld-duck's, at each note stretching out her neck, opening her beak,
and then withdrawing delicately back again to her former vertical
carriage. The whole action is extremely graceful and reminds one
somehow of the way an Indian dancer uses her hand and arm when
symbolically picking a flower. Sometimes when on land she runs
around her mate, using the same display and each time she passes
in front of him he extends his neck and opens his beak in a similar
manner to her, but in his case in silence.
The drake's display has two main forms, one used on land and the
other when on the water. When calling or during display the drake
tightens all his plumage as much as possible, giving himself a quite
fantastically long and thin outline. When displaying on the water
he sits looking extraordinarily long and thin. Sometimes he swims
backwards to place himself more favourably in relation to the duck.
He keeps repeating an asthmatic " wheek " at each note, extending his
neck upwards and giving his head a shake. This performance is
repeated several times, then suddenly he rears up exactly as does a
Mallard, giving the water a lightning bite and pulling his head up
along his body. A difficult display to describe, but anyone who has
watched a farmyard drake on a pond will know what I mean. When
on land the prelude is the same, but the second movement consists
of lowering his head to the ground quite quickly by bending only
the base of his neck. It always reminds me of a hammer which has
been stood on its handle and is falling down. As soon as his beak
touches the ground he raises his head again with a lightning movement,
swings his face at right angles away from the duck, uttering at the
same time a throaty " wheeoo ", a noise made by some people when,
scaring away cats. The duck occasionally does what I call the feather
ripping display, common to females of such diverse species as Ghiloe
Wigeon, Rosy-bill, and Carolina. I think it is really a speculum display
which is almost always performed by the female, though the male
Mandarin and Carolina both use abridged forms of it in their dis-
plays. I have never seen any Sheld-duck use it, but the female Black-
necked Swan often performs. The flights of one wing are slightly

lowered and at the same time the tertiaries are slightly raised. The
bird puts its head behind its wing, quickly running its beak over the
flight shafts, producing a noise like tearing cloth.
The invitation to mate consists of a raising and lowering of the
head and neck, while the pair float facing each other. This is the action
of Mallard, the Teals, Pintails, and Wigeons, but not of the Sheld-ducks,
which immerse their heads and necks, bringing them to the surface
with a jerk, as do the geese and swans. After mating the drake swims
rapidly round his mate as does a Mallard.
The duck had three nests during the summer and each one was
placed amongst rank herbage and not in a box or burrow. The nest
was a well-built affair for a duck and lined with down. Unlike any
other duck I have kept, she was noisy when on her nest and always
gave her position away by her incessant nattering. The eggs, of which
there were eight in the first clutch, are creamy white and rather
long. In size, shape, and colour they were indistinguishable from
those laid by our female Chiloe Wigeon.
The ducklings when first hatched are very similar to those of the
Common Pintail, but whereas the Pintails as they grow tend to become
a more level grey, the lighter patches of the Crested duckling's become
more conspicuous, and as they grow older they more resemble young
Sheld-ducklings. They are quite the worst-tempered of any duckling,
and even little birds of a week old will seize another duckling and
attempt to flog it with their little wing stumps. They are not par-
ticularly easy to rear and, like the young of the Common Sheld-duck,
require a great deal of animal food. I had always reckoned that
once a duckling had begun to feather it was past all rearing troubles,
but not so the Crested duckling, which seems to have a critical stage
at about five to six weeks old. At this stage they seem to completely
go off any artificial food, to take very little grain, and manage to
survive on green food and all the live food they are given or can find.
At the very stage when any normal duckling endeavours to keep its
crop perpetually full in order to grow its flight feathers quickly, the
Crested ducklings are off their food and finnicky like young Turkeys
shooting the red. The first plumage is a fawner and more washed out
edition of the adult's.
The old pair had a very strong desire to stake out a territory,
no bird, duck, goose, or Waterhen was allowed in it, but as soon as
they crossed the boundary the drake gave up his pursuit. When
driving off trespassers the drake extends his neck out along the water
and swims as fast as he can, the base of his neck is under water; often
he uses his wings to put on a spurt. The Australian Sheld-duck,
when breeding in the enclosure simply attacked anything within
sight and was quite impossible to keep there, but the Crested ducks
even when breeding, would come out of their territory to feed along-

side the other birds and they ignored them. After the other birds
learnt about the territory and did not go there they settled down quite
happily, but two pairs of Waterhens bred within it and kept him
busy from morning till night, which was probably a very useful
safety valve for his temper.

NOTES ON SOME WATERFOWL AT THE
SANCTUARY OF ST. LUCIA, ZULULAND

By the magic wand of modern transport one can be transplanted
in a matter of 72 hours or so into the heart of Zululand to a nature
reserve, the kind which one dreams of but seldom expects ever to find,
The wild life sanctuary of the Estuary of St. Lucia is a vast con-
glomeration of about everything known in geographical terms,
islands, rivers, lakes, swamps, lagoons, forests, isthmuses, deltas, high
forest-covered hills, vast mud- and sand-banks, etc., in fact all that
is conducive to varied and abundant bird life.
Here, under rigid protection, flourish almost every kind of waterfowl
known to inhabit South Africa. Vast flocks of Pelicans, Flamingoes,
Spoonbills, Storks, Ibis, Herons, Avocets, and a great many others
live out their lives undisturbed by Man as they did long eons ago.
In the dense forest patches, which vary from half an acre to many
square miles in extent, and on the savanah, live many rare and
wonderful species of endemic land birds, huge Hornbills, Touracous,
Rollers, Trogons, Glossy Starlings, Sunbirds, and a hundred other
kinds, but as our esteemed Editor has asked for a few notes for the
waterfowl number of the magazine, I must confine myself with those
birds.
The White-backed Duck (Thalassornis leuconotus ).--About half a
mile from the eastern shores of the Lake of St. Lucia on a narrow
isthmus of land between it and the sea and at the base of some forest-
covered hills are a series of " Blue Lily Pools " as we used to call
them. They are quiet still waters, the whole surface practically
covered with floating aquatic vegetation, including the lovely blue
African water lilies, which grow in great abundance. These are ideal
spots for certain types of water birds, yet, strange to say, only one of
these " pans ", as they are locally called, was inhabited and by a very
mixed population.
When one arrived there was a general scurry, some of the birds
flew away and others dived or hid amongst the reeds. After settling
in the shade of a forest tree and making oneself as inconspicuous as
possible, the pool came to life again, the Herons, Ibis, and Cormorants
which had flown away came back. The Ducks, Jacanas, Grebes, etc.,

came out of hiding and began to disport themselves on the surface,
and in an hour all was normal again.
The last of all to be noticed were those strange little birds, the
White-backed Diving Ducks, whose plumage blends so well with the
surrounding vegetation and who are ready to dive and disappear at
the slightest provocation.
For the main part they rest quietly and ride low on the water,
dozing or nonchalantly preening their plumage, or perhaps sun-
bathing, lying sideways with one foot stretched behind looking
disproportionately large, and covered by one wing seemingly so small
for the size of the bird.
In their actions and general demeanour they seem more like 'Grebe
than Ducks, continually diving with hardly a ripple and staying under
the water for long periods. They nest very near to the water's edge
in the dense reeds, or some authorities state, on masses of floating
reeds. They are amongst the most aquatic of the ducks and seem
hardly ever to come upon the land.
This species has very seldom been imported, though I think I re-
member seeing the Madagascar sub-species in the collection at Walcot.
The White-faced Tree Duck ( Dendrocygna viduata) . -- On the same
quiet lily pool where the White-backed Duck lived there was also
a small flock of these Tree Ducks breeding. Most of the birds seemed
to have five or six young ones, though one pair (?) had twelve which
used to swim head to tail in a long complicated line after one
of the adults. I rather think these were the young of two hens. In the
rear of this large family was a Gape Dabchick ( Poliocephalus ruficollis
capensis) which always fell into the line when it was formed and
followed on. As a matter of fact, a Dabchick seemed to attach itself
to each family and seemed to play the part of diving instructor !
Whenever the Dabchick dived, so did the young duck. This diving
often developed into a frenzy, the ducklings going under every few
seconds in exactly the same manner as the Grebe. In fact, so much
do the young resemble Grebes that I thought they were young Dab-
chicks when I first saw them at a distance.
These birds are fairly common around the St. Lucia area and are
frequently seen in small parties of from six to eight individuals. They
look very dark on the wing and while ordinary duck seem to fly in
a horizontal position, these seemed to fly at an angle.
These Tree Ducks do a lot of talking to each other in a kind of
low whistling conversation. They also do a lot of flying about from
one part of the pond to another.
I have kept them in England and found them tame and charming
birds, but unfortunately very susceptible to frost which affected their
feet.
Other duck seen were the Red-billed Teal (Pacilonetta erythrorhyncha ),

of which I had a pair given to me, but these escaped and were never
recaptured ; and also the Yellow-billed Duck (Anas undulata ), which
is the South African Mallard and in its habits seems to differ but
little from Mallards in general.
The European Pelican (.Pelecanus onoerotalus) and Pink-backed
Pelican (P. rufescens ).--Perhaps the most spectacular of all South
African birds, especially when in flight. These huge birds would
certainly not be able to hold their own in Southern Africa were it
not for the sanctuary of St. Lucia. They are birds which offer far
too tempting a target for the average South African, who suffers from
an all too ready itching #S trigger finger ", to resist. Also, the eggs
and young are edible---I was going to say " morsels ", but they are
pretty big ones--to the average native.
Strict protection and an abundance of fish have kept these birds to
what must be their orig'nal numerical strength of pre-European days.
Huge flocks frequent the lake, the estuary, and the sea-front proper
where the Umfalozi River runs into the sea.
The Pelicans are highly gregarious and keep in closely packed flocks
when resting on much frequented spots on the various islands or on
the sand-banks and on the beaches. One very low-lying island towards
the head of the lake was very much used by the birds, in company
with Sacred Ibis, Grey Herons, Wood Ibis, Spoonbills, etc. As one
approaches these spots where the birds are wont to rest, the most
overpowering &amp;lt;# fish market " smells assails one's nostrils. Few people
seeing Pelicans in zoos or stuffed specimens in museums realize how
beautiful these birds are in a state of freedom, for their plumage is
a lovely pale salmon pink colour, the feathers being remarkably smooth
and satin-like. Some birds do not have this pink bloom, probably
second-year young ones, the young ones of the&amp;apos;last nesting season,
have a strange ghostly look, being of a totally uniform monotone of
grey, including the feet, beak, face, and eyes.
The aerial exercises of the Pelicans are one of the most spectacular
things I have ever witnessed in the avian world. Hundreds of these
birds gather together high in the sky and go through all manner of
aerial manoeuvres. From, a distance it resembles a huge R.A.F.
display. There is compact flying in closely massed square formation,
this breaks up and the birds form into long frontal lines, small convoys,
lines tip to tail, formation flying of threes and fours together wing-tip
to wing-tip. The remarkable thing is that one hardly ever sees the
birds move their pinions, it is all done by gliding. The birds in the
various formations being all the time equidistant from each other.
There is nothing haphazard in these exercises, which last for hours
at a time. A Pelican, in spite of its bulk, is as graceful as a Seagull
in the air and, considering the weight of the bird, it takes but little
effort to get airborne.

When on the ground or on the water the birds are not unduly
timid, but allow one to get within fifty yards or so of them. On the
water they gather either in a compact mass or when moving proceed
in single file one behind the other. Their fishing is also remarkable.
The birds wait about the lake or estuary until a shoal of fish is
spotted, they then take to the water and form in a single line, gradually
forming into a semi-circle and driving the fish towards the beach,
and when these are in the shallow water there is a " general post "
and each bird seizes what it can.
During the hours of relaxation the birds often form into courting
couples and generally " bill and coo ", which consists of preening
each others plumage and holding one anothers' bills.
In a wild state the bills are most beautifully coloured with various
markings of pale blue, mauve, yellow, pink ; the huge pouch is bright
yellow.
The birds breed in the almost inaccessible marshes at the head of

Currency restrictions and fowl pest precautions make it difficult in
these days to build up a collection of waterfowl, but in spite of these
there have been some interesting new arrivals in the enclosures at the
New Grounds, where the Severn Wildfowl Trust has assembled some
650 ducks, geese, and swans of 86 different kinds. These enclosures
are open to the public (except on Sunday mornings, which are
reserved for members only) and the steady flow of visitors makes the
birds exceptionally tame. To me this is a most important feature of
a waterfowl collection, since rare birds are hardly worth keeping if they
are always hidden in the shrubbery or only to be seen running up and
down the far wire as soon as one appears upon the scene.
The collection has recently received a fine shipment of more than
fifty birds from across the Atlantic. These were presented to the Trust
by various aviculturalists, notably Dr. Dillon Ripley, Mr. Oliver

Undoubtedly the most important and interesting of these new
arrivals is a fine pair of Philippine Ducks (Anas luzonica) . The status of
the bird in the Philippine Islands does not seem to have been worked
out, but its range is undoubtedly very limited, and it is the first time
so far as is known, that it has ever been brought to Europe alive.
It is known locally as the Philippine " Mallard " which is not a
particularly appropriate name since, although clearly related to the
Mallard, it is much more distantly related than the North American
Black Duck, the Florida Duck, the Mottled Duck, the Australian Grey
Duck, Meller's Duck, the Spotbilled Ducks, and even perhaps the
African Yellowbill. Since none of these are called " Mallards " it is
obviously inappropriate to the Philippine Duck, which has so much
less in common with Anas platyrhyncha.
In the Philippine Duck the sexes are more or less alike and the
female, although a little less brilliant than the male, has none of the
mottled markings of the females of all other surface feeding ducks.
In this it seems to be unique in the genus Anas.
Both sexes have soft, greyish-buff bodies. At first I took this to be
fine vermiculation, but it is a smooth even grey tone, of great beauty.
The grey is paler on the neck and there is a sharp line where the red-
brown head-colour begins. This is very similar to the colour of a
Wigeon's head ; but the crown and a bold line through the eye are
jet black. There is a brilliant green speculum, the legs are dull orange
(although described by previous writers--who presumably had only
handled skins--as " blackish ") and the bill is a fairly bright slate
blue (again described as " blackish-grey ").
It has a rather long tail and very short wings, which give it a curious
round-backed look, and the flank feathers are exceptionally long.
When the birds first arrived these flank feathers were evidently not
completely waterproof and were always drooping into a curious little
peak. This still happens when the bird has been washing, but normally
the flank feathers lie flat along the sides of the tail.
The call appears to be very similar to the Mallard, but the female
has a low conversational chirrupping note and the male a low clucking
note. So far there has been little to observe in the birds' behaviour
except to note with regret that both--but especially the female--are
rather bad tempered with other species feeding near them. They
seem to be well paired and should breed. In any event the display will
be especially interesting as a pointer to the relationships of this curious
and beautiful species.
The arrivals from North America include a number of other
interesting ducks : a trio of Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) , a pair of
Indian Spotbills (Anas pcecilorhyncha) bred by Dr. Dillon Ripley this
year in Connecticut, and two pairs each of the closely allied Cinnamon
and Blue-winged Teal (Anas cyanoptera and Anas discoirs). It is particu-

larly pleasant once more to have a breeding stock of these two attractive
little Teal here in this country.
Nine Canvasbacks {Ay thy a valisineria) and seven Redheads {Ay thy a
americana ) completed the ducks in the shipment.
But there was also a fine selection of the North American Geese.
The most important were two pairs of the Pacific Black Brent {Branta
bernicla nigricans) . As far as I know the only ones previously seen in this
country were a pair which I wing-tipped on Tomales Bay, in Northern
California, and brought back in 1938. This sub-species is notably
darker on the belly than our European Dark-bellied Brent
{B. b, bernicla ) and the flanks are much paler, which makes a charac-
teristic contrast. The back has a sooty brown tinge, but the principal
difference is in the white neck ring. In the two European forms the
white consist of two flecks--one on each side of the neck. In the
Pacific race there is more white and it forms a continuous band round
the front of the neck.
Colonel Rankin brought no less than four of the seven recognized
races of the Canada Goose. Only one of these was new to the collection.
This was the Central form of the Honker {Branta canadensis interior).
The pair came from British Columbia and represent a race which
intergrades with the typical or Labrador form ( B. c. canadensis). The
breast, and indeed the general colouring is a little bit darker than in the
typical form. The bird is interesting in that it demonstrates the range
of racial variation in a species which is spread across a continent.
This central form is not to be confused with the large chocolate-
coloured western form {B. c. occidentals) which may possibly be shown
to deserve specific rank. This bird has an extremely restricted range,
breeding in the Queen Charlotte Islands and wintering on only two or
three marshes in Northern California and Washington. Its bill is
smaller than that of the ordinary Honker and the black " neck-
stocking " does not stretch so far down the neck. The whole of the
body feathering is deep chocolate-brown. For two years we have had
a gander of this form at the New Grounds. He was known to be
13 years old when he came. Now he has been joined by three more,
a young female and a breeding pair which are her parents. With
these came a pair of Lesser Canada Geese {B. c. iencopareia) and two
Cackling Geese {Branta minima) which appear to be females. These
four birds were apparently wild taken, having been wing-tipped. The
Lesser Canadas have joined a family of a brother and four sisters
which have been at the New Grounds for two years. They will be
useful for fresh blood. The sub-species is one which has a wide dis-
tribution in the central and Pacific flyways of North America. It is
about the size of a White-fronted Goose, or a little smaller, and in
colour it is exactly like the Central Canada Goose {B. c. interior).
The Cackling Goose is perhaps the most interesting of the races of

the Canada Goose. It is a very small dark form with a tinge of
cinnamon about the plumage of the breast. In size it is as small or
smaller than a Brent Goose, but has rather longer legs and a very
elegant carriage. It is one of the most charming of all the geese, and
genetically it is one of the most interesting, for it seems to represent the
dawn of a species. The bird breeds in Western Alaska and winters in
California, and so does the Lesser Canada Goose. But recently the
two have been found sharing the same breeding grounds at the mouth
of the Yukon, and not, apparently, mixing. There can be no doubt
that the Cackling Goose is closely related to the Canada Geese, and yet
according to present doctrine two birds which share a breeding ground
without interbreeding must be regarded as full species. So what was
Branta canadensis minima should now, perhaps, become Branta minima . 1
These and four Lesser Snows ( Anser hyperboreus ) completed the ship-
ment of geese, but the most spectacular of the birds brought by
Colonel Rankin were four magnificent Whistling Swans ( Cygnus
columbianus columbianus) . These have settled down very well and
are particularly interesting when compared with a fine female
Whooper recently sent to us in exchange by Mr. Terry Jones.
Apart from the new birds from North America, the Trust has
recently received a number of Marbled Teal (Anas angustirostris) from
the Persian Gulf. This bird, which has a range throughout southern
Europe and western Asia, is quiet but rather charming in appearance,
and interesting in that it has a plain pale grey wing, without speculum.
The species has not been seen alive in this country for nearly forty
years, when a number of specimens were kept in the Lilford collection
and also, I believe, at Mr. St. Quintin's collection at Scampston.
In this connection the Severn Wildfowl Trust took particular pleasure
in sending a pair of these birds to Mr. A. F. Moody at Lilford, who was
previously at Scampston, and who had not seen them for so long.
Another recent acquisition at the New Grounds is a group of four
Grey-breasted Tree Ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis discors ). This is
the South American race of the Red-billed Tree Duck, and is almost
the same except for the greyer breast. The sexes of Tree Ducks are not
easy to determine, but it seems possible that these birds make up two
pairs. They have settled down well and may sometimes be seen diving
in their pond. This is a most comical performance, as they jump
1 Aldridge believes that the Cackling Goose and the very small pale form--
Richardson's Goose (B. canadensis hutchinsii ) from Hudson's Bay are nonspecific and
that the two " miniature " forms should be grouped together as B. hutchinsii. This
would make the Cackling Goose's name B. hutchinsii minima. I do not, however,
agree that any evidence exists that the size is an older character than the plumage
colour. In short, I believe that the two miniature forms were evolved from larger
pale birds in the east and larger dark birds in the west. Since no other sub-species of
the Cackling Goose has been described this leaves Branta minima as the appropriate
name.

The Trust is aware of its good fortune in acquiring so many new and

Members of the Club, 24 ; guests, 7 ; total, 31.
The Chairman said it gave her especial pleasure to be able to
welcome Mr. Kenneth Hutchinson, the son of Mr. Rowland Hutchin-
son, Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural Society of New Zealand,
as principal guest of the Club. Many of those present were greatly
indebted to Mr. Hutchinson for the many food and seed parcels
sent during the war and which were, in fact, still being sent. It was
impossible adequately to convey thanks by letter, and she was glad
to have this opportunity of publicly thanking Mr. Hutchinson through
his son. The Club was always glad to have friends from the other side
of the Atlantic and was honoured by such a distinguished guest as
Dr. Elsa Allen, wife of Professor Arthur Allen, one of the foremost
ornithologists in America. Mr. Spurway, Director of Forestry and
Game Warden of Sarawak and Borneo, another representative of
the Commonwealth, was also very welcome.
Mr. Hutchinson said he was delighted to have this opportunity of
conveying the best wishes of the Avicultural Society of New Zealand,
a very small daughter, to the parent Society in England. He was
pleased to meet in person so many aviculturists who had hitherto
been to him but names in the Avicultural Magazine. He then
described briefly some of the birds successfully kept and bred in their
aviaries in Auckland, and touched on the avicultural conditions at

present prevailing in New Zealand. Of considerable interest was his
description of a mechanical "conveyor" for supplying mealworms,
gentles, grasshoppers, etc., to Shamas at regular intervals. Further
details of this ingenious device would be welcome.
Mr. Spurway dealt with a few of the birds of Sarawak and Borneo
and said one of the finest sights he had seen was a covey of seven
Bui war's Pheasants. Also under his protection was the One-horned
Rhinoceros, now reduced to but two bachelors. This species had been
virtually wiped out owing to the demand by the Chinese for the horn
for medicinal purposes. Whatever other birds there were in Sarawak
and Borneo the ubiquitous Sparrow was entirely absent. His own
personal theory regarding this was that birds arriving in the rigging
of ships were quickly killed by ever-watchful Peregrine Falcons.
Attempts to establish the Java Sparrow had not been successful.
Dr. Elsa Allen said she would like to tender the good wishes of
Cornell University. She had brought with her a recording, made by
Professor Arthur Allen and herself, of the songs of some American
birds. This, entitled " Birds of the Northwoods ", included such birds
as the Scarlet Tanager, Hermit Thrush, and Whippoorwill.
The Chairman commented on the fact that the recorders had
succeeded in overcoming extraneous sounds, a matter that presented
much difficulty. Mr. Vane proved a very efficient operator.
The Chairman warmly thanked the three speakers for their very
interesting contributions and proposed votes of thanks. These were
duly carried with acclamation.
Miss Knobel then caused very considerable amusement by her
recital of " Some of the things the Secretary is expected to know ".
This consisted of collected extracts from letters, etc., received during
her long term of office, and ranged from simple matters like giving
advice on what to do with a parrot that has laid an egg, and what to
do with the egg, to identifying numerous species of birds from very
decomposed bodies, the provision of a monthly translation into Italian
of the Avicultural Magazine, the supply of coloured plates for
papering a room, and the hire of Peacock feathers for a fancy dress dance !
Mr. Lynch showed an Indian Zosterop he had been colour feeding.
His purpose was to demonstrate that colour change could take
place without a moult. A lively discussion followed in which
Mr. Lynch's real object was virtually overlooked ; an argument
developing on whether colour-feeding had improved the bird or not.
While generally agreed that the bird was very attractive the consensus
of opinion seemed to be that it had not been improved. Mr. Dulanty
was particularly vehement in upholding the virtues of the natural bird.
Mr. Norris said he had known the species in freedom in India and it
then appeared to be more brightly coloured than aviary-moulted
specimens ; with this Mr. Ezra agreed.

Mr. Lynch then gave a very entertaining description of the omni-
vorous appetite of his Raven while in the keeping of Mr. Sibley :
nothing came amiss, from the Sunday joint to a large haddock,
and when it showed designs on the dog it was deemed best to send it
to the Zoo. His Touracou also had a large appetite and on one occa-
sion swallowed whole five Victoria plums, fortunately with no ill-effects.
Messrs. Sibley, Lynch, and Vane gave some of their experiences in
connection with the production of recent films. All three have had
almost incredible demands from the studios, but they have, never-
theless, managed in part to comply. After the expenditure of much
personal time and patience, and great expense on the part of the pro-
ducers, the results shown to the public were almost negligible.
The date of the next meeting is 12th January, 1949.

Tropical Birds. By Sacheverell Sitwell, 1948 (Batsford, 6 j-. 6 d.).
Since the war, any book containing coloured plates of birds has
sold in thousands--only limited by paper allocation. Somewhat
naturally it is the aim of many publishers to produce such a " best-
seller 55 . What easier than to select a dozen or so of John Gould's
plates and to add a few pages of descriptive letterpress ? This plan has
the advantage that Gould's work is introduced to very many who
otherwise would not have an opportunity of seeing examples. But it
is essential that the plates are carefully chosen and that the descriptive
matter is written by an authority.
The present volume, a Batsford Colour Book, contains sixteen of
Gould's plates and twelve pages of Introduction and Notes on the
Plates, contributed, we are told, by Sacheverell Sitwell. The general
presentation is excellent and it is interesting to note that it has been
printed in the Netherlands. The plates have reproduced remarkably
well and consist of Birds of Paradise, Cockatoos, Broadtails, King-
fishers, etc.
Gould produced at least a hundred lithographs of Parrot-like birds,
and it is a little surprising to find that one of the plates selected is
that of two Fiery Parrakeets (Platycercus ignitus) described as " typical
of the race ". This is unfortunate in that P. ignitus is a " species "
without status, being merely an aberration of the Rosella (P. eximius).
Incidentally, the spelling " Parakeet " is persistently used throughout.
As this is essentially a book of popular appeal, the author may,
perhaps, be forgiven his obvious love of metaphor--Birds of Paradise are

cancan dancers. Lorikeets " masquers in the Venetian carnival "--
but it is always undesirable to liken birds to human beings.
The literary style is unsuited to a book of this kind, for example,
the fulsome description of a Leadbeater's Cockatoo :--\0x25A0
" I have known one of these birds in captivity, if it can be called captivity where
the prisoner was treated as a beloved friend and guest, where its perch was perpetually
its owner's shoulder, and the white and rose petal of this ecstatic being, this messenger
of the arts of love and peace, did . really make the green , garden in Gloucestershire
under the apple trees, where a race of white doves crooned incessantly or clapped
their wings, into a corner of paradise and the terrestrial equivalent of ' a more
voluptuous region With long persuasion and much argument the cockatoo was
cajoled to raise its crest, a tricoloured crest of scarlet, white and yellow, lifting up
and spreading out into a fan, a fancrown or tiara, the centre part of the plumes
over the white base or crown being scarlet at their base, then yellow tipped with
scarlet--white, again, the points or spikes of the tiara, the rose petal effeminacy of
the bird's whole colouring, for of its particular beauty it could be but feminine like
rose petals or the fluting of a lovely shell, being corrected and made masculine by
the addition of this white-pointed diadem with its bold band of colours. And as
though to give proof that after all it is but earthly, this cockatoo, in common with
others of its race, gives off from its feathers a fine white dust which can be brushed
off, or it will stay in evidence upon the coatsleeve, the tangible relic of this celestial
visitant."
Nevertheless, readers are recommended to buy this book, the plates
are very good value.

British Cameroons. Amongst the many rarities brought back was a
Grey-necked Rock-fowl (.Picathartes areas). It is at present on exhibition
in the Tropical Bird House, and it is believed that this is the first shown
alive in captivity anywhere.
W. J. C. Frost, the indefatigable collector, but recently returned
from Singapore with a collection of animals and birds, has left for New
Guinea in search of Birds of Paradise, and does not expect to return
until next summer.
Dr. Dillon Ripley, Associate Curator, Department of Zoology, Yale
University, arrived in France on 13th October, en route for Nepal.
One of the main objects of his expedition is to search for the Pheasant-
Quail (Ophrysia superciliosa ). Almost nothing is known about this bird,
last reported in the foothills of the Himalayas some seventy years ago.
In spite of its small size it is considered to have close affinity to the

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.-
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures o.\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

NOTES ON BIRDS SEEN AT PRETORIOUSKOP,
KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, TRANSVAAL.

The Kruger National Park is perhaps the most famous of all national
parks, though " Park " is rather a misnomer, for this reserve is a vast
area of between eight and ten thousand square miles. Larger in fact
than the whole of Wales. It is one of the last refuges of South Africa's
much persecuted fauna.
It is true to say that were it not for this sanctuary most of South
Africa's larger animals would to-day be extinct ; some had already
disappeared, but since the formation of the Park numbers have found
their way in from Portuguese East Africa and re-established them-
selves.
The reserve is a vision of the glory that was once South Africa
before it was devastated by the European races. In the last hundred
years both the natural vegetation and the wild life has been subjected
to unending commercial exploitation, until few large animals are left
and one sees the results of erosion everywhere, due to the burning of
the veldt and the cutting down of the forests.
Fortunately the bird life has not suffered to the same extent as that
of the mammals, though quite a few of the larger birds, such as the
Giant Bustard, the Cranes, the Eagles, Geese, Pelicans, etc., have now
become exceedingly rare. A few more years will probably see the
end of some of the large and magnificent Eagles.
Unfortunately my visit to the Park was in the summer, when most
of it was closed owing to it being the malarial season, the only parts
being open to visitors being in the southernmost extremity, where the
camps of Pretoriouskop and Skukuza are situated.
Fortunately the bird life there is very abundant, especially the
tropical migrants, which depart in the autumn. Outside the camp
enclosures one's bird watching has to be done from a car, owing to
the abundance of lions, which one has sometimes to push gently off

the road with one's car bumpers to allow one to proceed on the
journey. This has its advantages, for one can watch the birds,
especially Plovers and Bustards from only a few yards' distance.
As the animals have never received injury from cars they remain
perfectly indifferent to them, and it is a great thrill to find oneself
surrounded by vast herds of zebra, wildebeest, impala, or to observe
from only a few yards that magnificent and exceedingly shy antelope,
the kudoo, or to see the head of a giraffe peeping down at one through
the open sunshine roof, or to watch that shiest and wariest of all
birds, the Giant Bustard, stalking majestically along within a stone's
throw from one's car window. To those not so interested in the avi-
fauna, the greatest excitement of all is to be surrounded by a pride of
lions and to have an inquisitive lioness put her front paws on the
running-board and look into one's car. This is usually more than the
nerves of most lady visitors can stand. The animals are not tame
--merely indifferent to cars.
After the Ostrich the Giant Bustard, or Gom Paauw (Gum Peacock)
of the Dutch, is, as far as weight is concerned, the largest African bird
and also one of the largest flying birds in existence. Previously, owing
to its wonderful eyesight and alertness, I have never been able to get
within half a mile of it on the very rare occasions when I have seen it
on former visits to Africa.
Before it received complete protection no game bird was more
sought after than this one, for, being larger than a Turkey, sometimes
weighing over 40 lb., it was no mean addition to the larder of the
Dutch farmer, especially as its flesh was stated to be delicious.
Even now very few farmers can withstand the temptation to shoot
it should it stray on to their lands, in spite of its protection. Con-
sequently the Gom Paauw is never seen except in the very isolated and
unsettled districts.
It was a great joy to see this noble bird practically without fear (at
least of motor cars), and to be able to approach it within a range of
comparatively few yards in the Kruger National Park.
Here on the areas of the veldt, which had been grazed by the vast
herds of zebra, gnu, etc., for the bird is never found in the long grass
where it is unable to see the surrounding country, one finds it stalking
along with a slow and measured gait and with a look of complete
hauteur.
Usually the birds are seen singly and never more than a pair together,
and even then they leave a considerable distance between them. As
the birds stride along on their never-ending perambulations, edible
morsels are picked up all the time---grasshoppers, locusts, lizards, in
fact, all manner of insects, small mammals and reptiles are consumed.
Quite large objects must be swallowed at times, for the bird has an
enormous gape, extending almost to the back of the head.

When being watched the Bustard will give a long and haughty
stare, resume its never-ending search for food, and gradually and
almost imperceptibly move away, getting further and further all the
time, until it is lost to sight.
The Superintendent of the Kruger Park, Col. Sanderburg told me
that he had seen these birds flying into trees preparatory to roosting at
night. This is interesting as I do not think Bustards normally roost in
trees. However if the birds didn't do this one wonders how they would
survive the hordes of jackals, lions, leopards, hyenas, and other
predatory animals which also find sanctuary in the reserve.
Some writers say that when the bird takes flight it quickly leaps into
the air. In my observation it takes quite a time, after running a
considerable distance, to get airborne.
Very often in the early morning the birds appeared very wet and
bedraggled, no doubt owing to heavy falls of dew.
My friend G. T. Astley- Maberly, who has spent very considerable
periods studying this bird, has frequently watched its display, which
is, as with most of the Bustard family, very spectacular. I hope he will
not mind my quoting his description of it, which appeared in the
Ostrich for July, 1937.
" When the mood is on him, the ' Pou 5 displays intermittently
throughout the day ; but to see him properly ' blown out ' in the early
morning or about sunset are the best times. . . . He gradually inflates
his throat until it resembles (from a distance) a luminous greyish-white
bladder, which projects beyond the tip of the bill. The crest meanwhile
is erected in a most aggressive manner until it resembles that of an
enraged Bittern. The tail is spread like that of a Turkey and raised
almost perpendicularly, thereby exposing the soft white undertail
coverts in the form of a kind of ' bustle '. Not content with the grotesque
caricature which he has now made of his otherwise dignified self,
Monsieur Gom-pou partially droops his wings and with head (or
what can be seen of it) poised at a supercilious angle, he proceeds to
strut about in the most aimless fashion, apparently completely
absorbed in self-contemplation. Actually his vision is so restricted on
account of the enormous distension of throat and neck that quite
frequently he stumbles over hummocks and small bushes ; while to
eat is manifestly impossible.
" When the distension is at its height, the Pou takes up his stance for
perhaps an hour or more near some small anthill or bush. At intervals
now he will vibrate this curious balloon-like object which represents
his neck and a peculiar sound results--soft, resonant, and far-carrying,
which I could best compare to the distant sound of a football being
kicked . . . Voomp ! . . . Voomp-voomp !
"As the sounds are produced the shining grey-white ' bladder ' is
distinctly seen to be vibrated. Presently from somewhere in the

surrounding c bush ', similar sounds may be heard indicating that
rival ' Pous 5 are similiarly blown-up at different points of the compass.
" Within a reasonable distance may be noticed the cause of all this
pomposity, the female ' Pou \ She takes not the faintest notice of it
all, however, and quietly walks about in search of grasshoppers and
other delicacies . . . though perhaps she occasionally vouchsafes
a discreet glance from the corner of her beautiful hazel eyes. When the
4 call from within ' asserts itself, Milord allows himself to subside like
a punctured tyre in order that he can pluck a few beakfuls of hastily-
snatched grass ; but such intervals are brief and little time is lost
before he re-inflates himself."
The name &amp;lt;c Gom-paauw " (Gum Peacock) was given to the bird
by the old Dutch settlers, who said that it fed upon the gum which
exudes from the thorn or acacia trees and which most animals seem
fond of. It is like pale amber and quite pleasant to eat or chew, being
much preferable to chewing-gum.
I saw specimens of this bird in the Zoological Gardens both at
Johannesburg and Pretoria, but they did not look happy in captivity ;
those in the latter place had many wild Pigeons confined in the
same aviary, which caused the birds' plumage to be spoilt by their
droppings. Kept in a large enclosure on dry sandy ground and pinioned
they would no doubt do well in their native land, but I doubt whether
they would ever thrive in this damp and dismal climate.
Besides the above there are nine other species of Bustards found in
South Africa, including eight of the small and delicate species known
as l&amp;lt; Korhaans ", which are something like miniature Cranes.
The only other Bustard seen in the Kruger Park was the beautiful Red-
crested Bustard, a bird with the body about the size of a domestic fowl.
These differ from most of the others of the family in that they seem
to prefer the wooded districts where the large timber grows. I only
saw it on a few occasions--a shy and wary bird usually on some mound
or other place of vantage where it could see the surrounding country.
Once I came upon a female when it was practically dark ; she was
attempting to seize a scorpion which was ably defending itself. On
our approach the bird departed and the scorpion fled into the grass.
Another time we came upon a hen in a great state of agitation and
which was endeavouring to cross the road, but our presence seemed
to stop her. I think she must have had young ones on the other side ;
however, she finally summed up courage and crossed within a few
feet of the car, and one was able to admire the beautifully vermiculated
plumage which is a mixture of brown, buff, sand colour, and fawn.
This bird has also a very spectacular display which unfortunately
I never witnessed but which had been frequently described. Gol.
Stevenson Hamilton, in his wonderful book Wild Life in South Africa ,
describes this display as follows : " Towards sundown the cock bird

will suddenly rise straight into the air, higher and yet higher, above the
sea of bush, until at a height of over a hundred feet he pauses as if
suspended, with flapping wings. Suddenly closing the latter tightly
to his sides, he drops to earth like a stone. With such velocity does he
fall that to the onlooker it seems that he must be dashed to pieces ;
but in a moment the wings are once more outstretched and with
a couple of graceful circles he alights safely and easily, once more to
rise and repeat the performance."
Mr. Astley-Maberly is the first to describe what precedes this
44 Towering display He writes (The Ostrich , July, 1937) : " During
September and October in the Low Veldt the charming, cheery,
ringing call of this Korhaan may be heard on all sides ; it is one of the
most typical sounds. Shortly after sunrise another strange sound may
be heard by those who listen for it. This is a measured 4 tap ! tap !
tap ! tap ! 5 which in its regular beat suggests some mysterious veldt
* time signal \ For a while I was completely at a loss to account for
these sounds and was suspicious that something was going wrong with
my car. However, the mystery was soon solved. One morning as
I * switched off J to watch and listen for birds, the strange tapping
commence close at hand and presently I located a cock Red-crested
Korhaan. He was perched on a small anthill, holding himself very
erect and opening and shutting his bill regularly. So wide is the bill
opened that one sees the tongue as well. With each brief closing of the
mandibles the sharp 4 tap s is produced and so the bird proceeds.
After about a dozen 4 bill-claps 5 the bird commences, simultaneously,
to utter his high-pitched call. Softly at first, it gathers in volume until,
as the ringing scream swells into its stride, the bill clapping ceases
altogether, and the performance becomes purely vocal. ... It is at the
end of this call when it has gathered almost hysterical emotion, that
the little Bustard shoots perpendicularly into the air like a rocker to
a considerable height, closes its wings and somersaults to earth with
a violence that causes the beholder to catch his breath, recovering at
the last moment to alight gently."
This bird has a bright red crest on the back of the head but it is not
very conspicuous at a distance and is apparently not used in the
display. The only other. species of Korhaan seen was the Black-
breasted, but my acquaintanceship with this bird was only very
fleeting and I made no notes on it.
That these small Bustards would make delightful pets is borne out
by a description of a pair of Blue Korhaans in The Game Birds and
Water Fowl of South Africa , by Major Horsbrugh. But, like the Giant
Bustard, they would need a hot dry climate to keep them healthy.
I hardly think they would flourish in this country unless. it was in
some dry spot in Hampshire where the soil was sandy.

THE WOOD SWALLOWS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997745651162791" page_id="56311708"  page_num="6" year="" vol="">
By R. W. McKechnie, Adelaide, South Australia
My first experience with these birds began with the accidental
trapping of two of the common Dusky Wood Swallow. This bird,
like the five others of the genus Artamus , is approximately the size
of the English Bramble-finch, and the body coloration in the case
of the Dusky is brownish black or sooty brown. This bird is the least
migratory of the family and is to be found in areas close to Adelaide
for most of the year. The numbers of birds seen vary, indicating that
probably not all birds remain in southern latitudes throughout the winter.
After the birds were caught no difficulty was experienced in inducing
them to take readily a softbill mixture, flavoured alternately with
mealworms and termites (white ants). Quite soon both birds were
eating every variety of food offered, and at no time looked other than
in perfect condition.
The problem of sexing these birds proved difficult. The only relief
of the body colour described above is a bluish tinge of the primary
flights ; and a white edging of the main tail feathers. The beak, as in
all Wood Swallows, is a steel-grey tipped black. The under surface
feathering of the wing is another feature of all birds of this family,
being a silver grey, and only visible when the birds are planing in
flight. All features described above apply to both sexes, and thus
helped very little in sexing the birds.
At this stage it was decided to assume that the birds were a true
pair and as such an attempt should be made to breed them. Many
nests had been observed in the state of nature, and a preference was
usually shown for a large fork of a tree or a loose shingle of bark,
behind which the flimsy nest was constructed. Although several ideal
sites were offered, the birds showed a preference for a 4-in. flower-
pot, hung on a post in the open flight. Many types of nesting material
were offered, and in September, although the birds were obviously
anxious to nest, the material offered seemed to leave them wanting.
Several times a nest was partly constructed only to be destroyed and
a fresh start made. The season progressed, and it was felt that the hen
would surely lay in an empty pot, in which case the possibility of
successful incubation seemed remote.
As a last resort it was decided to attempt to substitute a nest made
by a pair of Duskys at liberty and see if my birds would be satisfied
with this second-hand home. A nest was obtained and duly installed
in the chosen flower-pot and an anxious time was spent watching the
birds to see the reaction to this latest offer. The hen, after careful
approach, eventually settled into the nest and made a few minor
adjustments to fit her body, and then seemed quite satisfied with the
result. This development occurred on a Saturday and to my great

surprise upon investigating the borrowed nest on Sunday an egg was
observed. The clutch was completed on Tuesday when the second egg
was laid. The difficulties now seemed over as, after a fourteen-day
incubation shared by both birds, two young hatched. These were
reared to maturity on a diet of mealworms, white ants, and softbill
mixture, comprising plain cake, dog biscuits, hard-boiled egg, and
boiled bullocks 5 liver. So much for the Dusky Wood Swallow.
After this success, with possibly the first breeding record of the bird
in captivity, I decided to try another species of Wood Swallow, but as
it happened, two species were taken together. These birds were the
White-browed and Masked Wood Swallows. Unlike the Dusky, these
birds are definitely migratory, arriving in southern South Australia
in late October to breed, departing again northwards in late January.
Both species often arrive in breeding areas together, and mixed
colonies are not as unusual as are a colony comprising only one species.
Both these birds are more pleasing to the eye than the sombre Dusky.
The Masked's body is coloured a lovely French grey, with a large
black facial mask and throat, bordered with a white band running up
to behind the eye. With the White-browed the under body colour
extending from the breast to the vent is a warm brown. The facial
mask is again black and the throat patch extends almost to the breast,
the white edging to this mask is absent, and the back and wings a slate
blue. Two large white eyebrows complete the description, extending
from close to the base of the beak up over the eyes to the back of the
head.
A nesting colony of these birds was located some sixty miles south of
Adelaide, a journey to the spot was made, and the birds seen in circum-
stances which defy description. The nesting site was on the banks of
the Murray River, the location the homestead garden of a sheep farmer.
Every conceivable nesting site seemed to be occupied, the birds
nesting with equal abandon in orange, apricot, almond, and plum
trees, not to mention the many nests in gums and pines bordering this
small garden, also those at the very front door of the homestead in
ornamental shrubs and cacti. As one could imagine, the height of the
nests from the ground varied from 2 feet to those built in last season's
Magpie's nest, high in the tree-tops. As in the case of most colony
breeders, when approached, a general panic takes place, which makes
it a difficult task to trap any birds. The general practice of the birds
is to wheel high in the air scolding, and as individual nests are
approached an old bird will dive-bomb the intruder, turning off at the
last moment. This proved the case with this colony, and although
many types of traps were tried both with live food bait and with a nest
of young birds as decoys, the best result was to have an occasional bird
alight on the trap without touching the trigger, lean over, snatch a
mealworm, and make off.

Time soon passed, and at dusk it was decided to try and catch some
birds on their nests after dark. After several attempts a pair of each
species were secured, plus their young, and so ended a long remembered
day. My share of the booty, as chief snatcher, was the adult birds, and
before detailing my experience with these I would like to say that all
five youngsters taken were reared by hand to maturity.
Birds taken in the middle of the breeding season, as these were,
naturally do not settle down enough to breed until the following year,
but my birds showed no unrest by their enforced stay in southern
latitudes, after their kin had migrated north. The Masked started
nesting the following August, two months earlier than birds arrive in
the nesting areas. The sexual difference in both these Swallows is
marked, the hen in each case is a duller edition of the cock, so no
doubts were entertained in this direction.
The birds behaved in a perfectly normal manner, and both species
nested in shrubs in the open flight in positions similar to many I had
seen in the nesting colony of the previous year. As mentioned above
the Masked were first, and as if bred they would be another first
recording, I was delighted when they had a solitary youngster on the
wing. Success was, however, short-lived, as this chick died when only
a week out of the nest and far from independent. The White-browed
followed with better luck, rearing two nice young with the same food
and incubation as the Duskys. The Masked took heart from this per-
formance and again hatched a clutch of which one, a cock, was reared
to maturity.
The eggs of these birds, while collectively similar, are not difficult to
distinguish, mainly by the arrangement of brownish-black spots, in
the case of the Dusky, in a ring at the largest diameter of the egg. In
the White-browed the ring of spots is present, plus a scattering of spots,
all at the large end. The Masked has no formation of spots, these being
distributed over the egg from end to end.
At this stage the possibility of obtaining any of the remaining three
Swallows looked very remote. The Little Wood Swallow is not recorded
in South Australia, the Black-faced and White-breasted reported only
very occasionally within a hundred miles of Adelaide. On a recent
excursion, by the purest of chance, as is often the case, a few pairs of
Black-faced Swallows were found, apparently some considerable
distance out of their territory. Unlike any of the family previously
encountered, these birds were feeding from the ground which made
trapping by a mealworm-baited spring trap a simple matter. The
latest development possible to report is, three Black-faced Swallows,
quite difficult to sex, are settling down nicely, and their owner has just
convinced himself that out of three birds, the chance of a pair is much
better than that of two Duskys.

During the war, I used to read again and again all the books in my
avjcultural library, including those delightful little textbooks and
periodicals, in which most of the Waxbills and foreign Finches were
stated to be reliable breeders. In common with many others, I had
never found that description was accurate except in the case of Zebra
and Parrot Finches. 1948 has shown me that I was perhaps a little too
suspicious. My old friends the Parrot Finches let me down, and
although one pair laid and sat on five clutches not a single egg was
fertile.
Three pairs of Red Avadavats all nested successfully, one pair
producing two broods. Orange-breasted and Dufresnes Waxbills also
reared young.
Nos. 1 and 2 pairs of Avadavats were both in separate small
aviaries 4 feet wide, 6 feet high, and 14 feet long, consisting of
shelter, covered and open flight, the back and ends of which are
boarded. No. 1 pair laid three eggs about the beginning of July, all of
which hatched and were reared. They nested again in September and
reared two. The nest in each case was built in a " Keston " wire
finch-nestbox with the front left open. Their companions were a pair
of Blue-breasts, but the hen died before any attempt at nesting could be
expected. There were also two other odd birds in the aviary at the
time, but I forget what they were. The Avadavats were peaceful
enough, except if any others went too near the nest, but after hatching
they seemed not to be nearly so ready to drive off intruders.
No. 2 pair were willing to start at about the same time and they too
chose a Keston wire nestbox. Their companions were an old pair of
Zebra Finches who at the time had just reared five young Longtail
Grassfinches. When these flew they used the Avadavats 5 nest as a
roosting place and held up operations until they were removed. As
soon as that happened the Avadavats settled down and reared two.
No. 3 pair were in my largest aviary, which has a naturally planted
flight, 24 ft. by 18 ft. wide, the roof rising from 6 ft. 6 in. at the sides to
g ft. in the centre. The shelter is only 5 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. by 0 ft. 6 in.
high. There were about twenty or so other small Finches and Waxbills
in this aviary. As the Avadavats in particular seemed to spend a great
deal of time in the bushes, I quite thought they would build there, but
they also chose a wire receptacle, this time consisting of a cylinder of
|-in. mesh wire netting with a piece of roofing felt rolled up with the
wire to form a roof, and one end squeezed up to make the back. I have
found these are very popular with Finches and Waxbills and of course
they are cheap and very easy to make.

B. H. DULANTY-BREEDING WAXBILLS AGAIN
Nos. i and 3 pairs both had fresh wood ants, cocoons, of which I
bought 1 lb. per week from an advertiser in Cage Birds. Provided they
are spread out and air allowed to circulate over them they keep about
a week. They are supposed to be killed, I assume by placing in the
oven, but if the weather is at all warm quite a few hatch out each
week. I had thought it would be a splendid idea to put them in the
refrigerator, but the veto was exercised when my wife saw one of these
ants. Only one mind you ! She had already refused to allow maggots
to be put there, in spite of the fact that I told her that the method was
strongly recommended by Wallace Wood. The reader will gather
that there is a lack of that spirit of co-operation which we are told is
so necessary to increase production.
No. 2 pair and No. 1 for their second brood were too late for ants,
eggs, but seemed to find maggots a perfectly satisfactory substitute.
I noticed that the pair in the big aviary seemed to spend a great deal
of time hunting in the bushes and on the grass, which in their aviary is
mowed every week with an ordinary lawn mower. I did not expect
any great breeding results from the birds in this aviary, otherwise
I should probably never have started to mow the grass for fear of
causing desertions. When later on the Avadavats and few others
nested, I found that it made no difference. For example a pair of
Zosterops had three nests and sat the full time in each case, unfor-
tunately without result. Each nest was in a box bush or creeper and it
was necessary to mow right round them. The hen would come off
while the mowing was going on but returned as soon as it stopped.
Perhaps it may have been an advantage that it was necessary to go
into the flight each evening to feed, so that the birds became used to
me walking about the flight. In the same way, if you want to examine
nests, do it each day or not at all, at least if birds can see you. I noticed
that after they had flown the young Avadavats all returned to the
nest at night, but spent most of the day in the shelter. They were
almost the only birds in the big aviary who made any use of it except
for feeding.
The Orange-breasts and Dufresnes were together in an aviary of
the same general pattern as those first described but only 1 o ft. long
overall. The Orange-breasts started first building again in a Keston
wire box in the shelter. The first clutch resulted in only one youngster,
which left the nest a day or two early. Unfortunately I did not get
home that night until after dark and found it dead in a corner of the
shelter the next morning, the weather being very cold at the time
(mid-June !). That so often seems to be the fate of single nestlings.
The cock Orange-breast became very pugnacious when building and
sitting on eggs, so much so that the Dufresnes were discouraged from
their attempts at building. The latter never went into the shelter as
the seed hoppers were hung on the wall of the covered flight. They

B. H. DULANTY-BREEDING WAXBILLS AGAIN I I
roosted between two horizontal joists in the open flight with very little
protection over head. As there were several cold snaps at the period,
I was very worried about them, but they seemed to be none the worse.
As soon as the Orange-breasts hatched, the cock stopped his persecution
and the Dufresnes built in a wooden box from which the top half of
the front had been removed. They built the nest low down at the back
of the box with a curved tunnel leading to it, so that the eggs could
not be seen and it was a job even to feel them. This aviary is one of
those prefabricated ones that used to be advertised so widely before
the war and like most of them is badly designed. There is no feeding
door and the only entrance door is the full .height of the flight, so that
each time you go in there is a risk of a bird coming out. Soon after the
birds had been put out I was in the flight stooping down to give fresh
water. The birds had as usual all gone into the shelter and I was
taking no further notice of them until I heard a call in the garden
which sounded like Waxbills. My ears did not deceive me and I saw
both Dufresnes in some peasticks about 50 feet away. The door,
which was fitted with a spring, had not closed properly and they had
flown over my head and out. I shut the Orange-breasts in the shelter,
propped the entrance door wide open, and feeling that it was all
pretty hopeless, went to see what a # 1 o pair of Waxbills looked like at
liberty. I must say they were a delightful sight flitting about long
grasses and weeds (of which there was a good supply), never flying
more than a few yards. I gently chivvied them towards the aviary and
the cock flew straight in. I caught him and put him in a small wire
cage in the flight and the hen followed almost as soon as I left the
aviary. After that a large whisky was the obvious sedative for shattered
nerves. Perhaps I should not lay too much blame on the aviary,
because that was the first of a series of escapes last summer, although
in the other cases I was not the culprit. However, Zosterops, Peach-faced
Lovebirds, a hen Canary, Golden Pheasants, a cock Parrot Finch have
all had experience of a larger world than that bounded by wire netting
and all have returned safely after an hour or a day, or in the case of one
of the Zosterops, a week, during which time I never heard or saw him.
To get back to the breeding, the Orange-breast hen seemed to find
the ants' eggs very much to her liking, although for the first nest I never
saw the cock touch them. Seeding grass and soaked millet were his
favourites. When it was their turn the Dufresnes took no apparent
notice of the ants' eggs and on reading Miss Elsie Robinson's account
of the first breeding of this species in the Avtcultural Magazine
(October, 1934), I saw that she found they did not care for this form
of live food, but they would eat the cocoons of the meadow ant. I went
out and got a bucketful from a neighbouring field and gave them some.
The birds went for them at once and polished them off at a great rate.
I then proceeded to separate the ants' eggs from the earth with which

they were gathered by the oft described method of spreading them out
on a sheet. Meadow ants take rather longer about the job of separating
than wood ants, but they get there in much the same fashion. After
a few hours pockets of eggs and ants will be found in any fold in the
sheet and may be then scooped up. I put them all into a galvanized
trough about i foot high and 18 inches in diameter, so that the ants
could not remove the cocoons during the day.
However, after a few days, I found that the Dufresnes took to the
wood ants' cocoons, no doubt following the lead of the Orange-breasts.
The Dufresnes reared three in their first nest and two in their
second. Like the Avadavats the second nest came too late for ants'
eggs, so that maggots had to take their place.
The Orange-breasts reared four young in their second nest and were
feeding three in the third when the hen injured her foot in some way.
The cock carried on for a day or two, but eventually all three died.
On the whole, I have no serious complaints about breeding in 1948.
Apart from Parrakeets, I have bred well over fifty birds, including
besides the Waxbills : Gouldians, Long-tailed Grass Finches, Cut-
throats and Zebra Finches.

THE ORIGIN OF THE YELLOW REDRUMP
PARRAKEET
By Edward Boosey
Now that Yellow Redrumps have become thoroughly established in

<bodyText confidence="0.9824616875" page_id="56311714"  page_num="12" year="" vol="">
aviaries throughout the British Isles as well as on the Continent, it
seems the appropriate time to put on record just where and when this
" sport " of the common Redrump was first propagated.
The first Yellow Redrump ever to be seen in Europe was sent from
Australia in 1935 to the then Marquess of Tavistock who wrote and
asked me if I would care to have a shot at breeding from it, and I
replied that I should be only too pleased to do so, and I was of course
very thrilled at the thought of seeing something entirely new. The
bird, which turned out to be a hen, arrived here at the Keston Foreign
Bird Farm a few days later. Incidentally I think I am right in saying
that it was a wild-caught specimen, and not one that had occurred as
a sport among aviary-bred stock.
In colour it was not so much yellow, as a pale shade of creamy-buff,
but it was certainly a great improvement upon the very dull and
uninterestingly-coloured common form of the hen Redrump.
The bird was in due course mated to an ordinary cock Redrump

which, however, had been specially chosen for his outstanding colour.
We thought this advisable because, as any one who has kept them
knows, males of this species vary very considerably as to the brilliance
of the green in their plumage, as well as to the extent and richness of
the red rump colouring.
That avian Poltergeist, X, of the mere mention of whose existence
Mr. Alastair Morrison so strongly disapproves (simply an excuse for
the Aviculturist's own incompetence !), must on this occasion have been
on holiday, or perhaps on more important business elsewhere, or it is
even possible that I myself was less incompetent than usual. At any
rate, to my utter astonishment, this hen Yellow Redrump--at that
time the only known specimen in the world--instead of suddenly
dropping dead from the perch in a fit, refusing to breed, becoming
egg-bound, breaking her eggs or murdering her brood, actually--
believe it or not--reared, in two nests, 10 fine young ones during her
very first season here. And, what's more, these turned out to be five
hens and five cocks !
All the young ones were, of course, ordinary Greens in appearance,
and the following year I mated them brother to sister. The result of
these matings was broods consisting of Green cocks and hens with also
a certain proportion of Yellow hens, exactly like their grandmother.
This was slightly disappointing because naturally my chief desire
was to see what a cock Yellow Redrump would look like. It did, how-
ever, prove one thing, namely that it was a sex-linked inheritance.
I therefore decided that the best thing to do was to part the original
Yellow matriarch from her Green husband, and mate her to one of her
sons.
I cannot now remember exactly what this mating produced, except
that at least one young Yellow cock was reared--the first one ever to
be bred. But I can still remember the excitement when we found there
was a Yellow young one in the nest with a red rump !
Actually young cock Yellow Redrumps are a purer combination of
yellow and red in the nest, and when they first leave it, than they ever
are afterwards, as when adult the feathers of the head, tail, wings and
mantle become more or less suffused with a pale greenish-grey colour,
which is usually rather brighter and greener on the head.
I confess I had rather hoped for a Canary yellow bird with a red
rump, but this was perhaps rather unreasonable, as Yellow Redrumps
are, after all, not lutinos. In fact I have always considered that they
bear very much the same relationship to common Redrumps as the
pastel coloured Silver Zebra Finch does to the common form of Zebra
Finch. I think, however, that now they have become so well established
and are being bred by many different Aviculturists all over the country,
as well as on the Continent, changes will doubtless soon appear,
possibly towards a more truly yellow bird.

As instances of this tendency to change, we have a yellow hen with
various red feathers on the rump, and last year we bred a young cock
with a wide and distinct though rather irregular shaped band of deep
orange-red feathers across the lower breast. However since then this
bird has, surprisingly and rather disappointingly, completely reverted
after a second moult, to the normal plumage of a cock Yellow Redrump.

It is hoped to publish in succeeding numbers of the Avicultural
Magazine a series of eight or nine articles on Australian Psittacine
birds, dealing with the different species principally from the avicul-
tural viewpoint. These articles will, where possible, deal with the
author's personal experiences in keeping and breeding the various
species in captivity in South Australia ; where this is not feasible,
accounts of the experiences of other aviculturists or of Zoos in Australia
will be given and, in rare instances, the experiences of persons or
institutions outside Australia will, of necessity, be quoted.
In this preliminary article the writer's views on general management
are given.
Housing .--In Australia fixed aviaries are the invariable practice, and
for economy of space and material it is usual to construct blocks of
aviaries consisting of a number of adjoining compartments. The
only disadvantage of this arrangement is that it is virtually impossible
to keep closely related species in adjacent cages without considerable
fighting resulting in loss of toes and even beaks ; consequently it is
necessary to arrange the occupants of a block of cages with due care.
It is stressed at the outset that length is of prime importance in
aviary design, width and height being of relatively little moment.
Thus it is generally considered that a width of three feet is adequate
for the smaller Parrots and four feet for the larger species ; for Cocka-
toos a width of six feet should be the minimum. The height of an
aviary should not be less than six feet but anything over eight feet is
quite unnecessary. As already indicated, the length of the flight portion
of the aviary should be as great as possible ; the author's own aviaries
have six feet flights for the smaller and nine feet for the larger Parrots
and these are regarded as the absolute minimum length. For Cockatoos
a flight of fifteen feet is considered the minimum.

The aviary shelter should be at the rear of the flight and of the same
width. It should also be of the same height as the flight where it
adjoins it, and should rise about another two feet at its back, thus
allowing of a sloping roof. The front of the shelter should be closed for
a half to a third of its extent to allow privacy, shade, and protection of
birds and food from rain. The shelter need not be more than four or
five feet in depth and its roof should project a foot or more over the
adjacent portion of the flight in the form of a veranda and should
preferably end in a gutter.
Communicating doors between adjoining compartments are best
situated in the flight portion under the veranda as shown in the
accompanying diagram ; they are time-saving in regard to feeding
and watering and prevent the unnecessary disturbance of the inmates,
which invariably occurs if the doors are placed at or near the fronts of
the flights. Doors placed between the shelters are liable to interfere
with the correct positioning of the food and water.
The flight framework is best constructed of galvanized iron piping
of either half or three-quarter inch width, which can easily be erected
with the use of special fittings or clips which obviate the necessity for
cutting threads on the piping and using threaded unions. Half-inch
mesh netting is satisfactory in most instances, although three-eighth inch,
when available, has the great advantage of being mouse-proof, although it
is considerably more costly. If it is proposed to keep some of the larger
species, such as the Ringnecks and larger Rosellas, the wire netting
should be of heavy gauge, as these birds are able to bite holes in the
light gauge. For Cockatoos chain wire is essential and one-inch mesh
will be found to be sparrow-proof.
Aviaries should always be made rat-proof, either by having a con-
crete foundation to a depth of a foot belo w ground level for all external
walls or by continuing the half-inch mesh beneath the ground for the
same distance. If mouse-proofing is desired and half-inch netting is
used, it is then necessary to use flat iron sheeting sunk one foot into the
ground and raised the same distance above ground level, with an
out-turned flange about two inches wide at the top.
The shelter is probably best constructed of brick or concrete, but
a hardwood framework with asbestos sheeting makes a much cheaper
and quite satisfactory job ; small-fluted galvanized iron sheeting is
adequate but has the disadvantage of getting very hot. The roof may
be made either of galvanized iron or of corrugated asbestos and the
floor of the shelter should always be of concrete for ease of cleaning ;
the floor of the flight is composed of the natural earth with or without
a covering of sand.
Aviaries (in Australia) should preferably face either north or east,
or in general words, away from the prevailing cold wind.
The writer believes that the number of perches should be reduced

to a minimum in order to encourage flight and places one about
a foot from the front end of the flight and about a foot below the roof,
another under the veranda at about the same height, and a third in
the shelter which is invisible from the front of the flight, and is so
placed that droppings do not foul the seed or water ; this last perch is
situated as high as possible towards the rear of the shelter to afford the
maximum protection. Either garden stakes with the sharp edges
planed off and of a size in proportion to the birds or natural branches
may be used ; the latter need to be renewed fairly often but have the
advantage that the birds spend much time removing the bark, thereby
preventing boredom and the development of overgrown beaks.
Feeding .--For the smaller Parrots, e.g. the Grass Parrots, the writer
uses a seed mixture consisting of two parts of Canary seed, two parts of
pannicum (a small variety of millet), and one part of hulled oats. For
the medium sized species, e.g. the Psephoti , the mixture used is equal
parts of Canary, pannicum, hulled oats, and sunflower, and for the
larger species, e.g. Ringnecks, Rosellas, and Kings, the mixture consists
of two parts each of hulled oats and sunflower and one part each of
Canary seed and pannicum. Wheat may also be added to this mixture
but it is not generally eaten until most of the other seed has been
consumed. In pre-war days hemp was also fed to both medium sized
and large species in equal proportions to the sunflower and oats, but
it has unfortunately been unobtainable in Australia for many years
now. For Cockatoos the staple diet should be sunflower, oats, wheat,
and small or cracked maize in roughly equal proportions ; boiled
maize is often appreciated more than the hard seed. Black Cockatoos
seldom will eat any seed other than than sunflower and occasionally
hemp. As regards Lorikeets, there is little unanimity of thought and the
writer's personal experience is very small. It is admitted that the
larger species can be kept for long periods and even bred on a seed
diet alone, but most persons who have kept these birds at all extensively
are agreed that a combination of a seed diet and bread and milk
sweetened with either sugar or honey is desirable. The use of sweetened
maize meal is also advocated, and recently trapped birds are usually
sent south from Queensland on this diet. The smaller Lorikeets
practically never eat seed under any circumstances.
Green food in one form or another is desirable at all times and
essential during the breeding season for all species except Lorikeets and
some of the Cockatoos. All forms of seeding grasses are appreciated
and the common little garden weed known locally as winter grass
(Poa annua) is a very valuable food and has the advantage of being
available in the early spring when other grasses are not easily obtained.
Thistles are very good but should not be too coarse, it is advisable
to pick only the flowering tops. Of the cultivated vegetables, lettuce
is a great standby and is much relished by most species; silver beet

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992935422222222" page_id="56311720"  page_num="18" year="" vol="">
is also a very useful food. It should be stressed that all greens should
be given fresh and leavings should be removed the following day.
Fruit in the form of apples and sometimes pears or grapes is relished
by almost all the Parrots and is an absolute necessity for the smaller
Lorikeets and is highly desirable for the larger. Although the true
Parrots can survive almost indefinitely without fruit, the writer con-
siders that it is a very desirable addition to the standard diet at all
times and is practically essential during the breeding season. The
Cockatoos vary very considerably in their fondness for fruit and the
black varieties will seldom touch it.
Nuts such as almonds and peanuts are keenly sought after by the
larger Parrots and Cockatoos and are undoubtedly beneficial. Pine
nuts are greedily eaten by most Black Cockatoos, but large supplies are
hard to obtain.
The writer prefers to feed daily, or if this be impracticable, on
alternate days. The seed trays used are shallow cake tins raised about
one foot from the ground on pedestals to render them inaccessible to
mice. Various forms of hoppers can be used to obviate the necessity
for feeding other than at week-ends, but there is always the possibility
of blockage and starvation, even with the most fool-proof designs. It
is essential that the sweetened bread and milk mixture used for Lori-
keets should be renewed daily.
In addition to food, cuttle-fish bone should be available at all times
as a source of lime ; it will be found to be particularly sought after
during the breeding season.
Watering .--Fresh water should be provided daily in the hot months
and not less frequently than every second day during the cooler months
of the year. Glazed earthenware bowls are the easiest to keep clean ;
they should not be more than two or three inches deep and should be
placed in permanent shade in the aviary shelter, clear of perches to
avoid fouling of the water. The diameter of the bowl used varies with
the size of the bird ; but as some of the larger species such as Kings,
Rock Pebblers, and their allies do not bathe except in rain, relatively
small vessels will suffice for them. Nearly all psittacine birds like
a spray and any form of garden sprinkling device is appreciated
especially by those birds that only bathe in rain. The various auto-
matic devices used by poultry keepers for watering have been adapted
for aviaries, but, as with hopper feeding, there is always the fear of the
system failing.
Nesting Accommodation .--Hollow logs, of varying lengths and diame-
ters according to the size of the bird in question, undoubtedly make
the best nesting appliances. One end of the log is securely closed with
sheet-iron and the opposite end is closed in such a way as will allow of
opening for inspection purposes, a side hole being cut near the top
end. Alternatively, the top end may be left completely open or partly

closed with wood. The logs are hung at an angle of approximately 45
degrees with the horizontal, either under the veranda or immediately
behind the part-closed front of the shelter, so that the side opening, if
present, faces out into the flight. Inside the log is placed some of the
mixture of rotten wood and earth that accumulates at the bottom of
a woodheap. Care must always be taken to see that the hen has not
managed to eject all of this material prior to laying her eggs, and if
this has been done more must be placed in the log. Earth or sawdust
may be used as alternatives to the above-mentioned material.
The writer removes the logs from the aviaries as soon as the breeding
activities are obviously over and does not replace them until the birds
show signs of coming into breeding condition, usually about the end
of July or beginning of August in the case of most species.
It is well to emphasize that Parrots are extremely tolerant of inter-
ference with their nests, and the writer has never known a case of deser-
tion of eggs or young which could be attributed to inspection of the
logs, even if it involves manual removal of the sitting bird from the
nest, a practice which should be avoided whenever possible on account
of the risk of damage to eggs.

The mould diseases known collectively as Mycosis and occurring
sometimes in human beings (bronco-mycosis, actinomycosis, etc.)
are represented in birds--fairly frequently in some, rarely or never in
others--by one caused by the spores of the mould Aspergillus fumigatus
and known as aspergillosis.
The disease is thought by some to be due to keeping the birds under
insanitary conditions, but this is not necessarily the case, for certain
species living in large enclosures day and night in the open air will
contract it more readily than will the Waxbill in the dealer's shop.
The mould is said to form most readily on damp hay, but there is
little doubt that mouldy grain is a frequent source of infection, and the
spores appear to be air-borne.
It is a curious fact that some birds are highly susceptible, while others
are almost, if not completely immune. The domestic fowl, which
often eats mouldy food and lives in close contact on farms with mouldy
hay, must be immune, while other gallinaceous birds seem to be
highly resistant. As might be expected, the sea-birds are among the
most susceptible, though, oddly enough, not all to the same extent.
For instance, at Sterrebeek we found that Long-tailed ducklings
very readily contracted aspergillosis and Scoters less readily, while
I do not recall a case among Eiders, Barrow's Golden-eye, Harlequin,
Merganser, or Goosander ducklings. I have seen the disease in a
Bewick's Swan, and during the war I had an inj&amp;apos;ured juvenile Herring
Gull which died from aspergillosis within three weeks, though an
injured Black-headed, kept under similar conditions, lived a long
time and never contracted it.
At Slimbridge during early 1947 several newly caught Brent Geese
and Wigeon--both, it will be observed, largely sea-shore birds--
died from it, but there were no cases among other Ducks or Geese.
When making a collection of birds in the Gameroons forest, a place
where heat and humidity combine to make a paradise for moulds of
many kinds, I lost a Babbler and on examination found, to my dismay,
the familiar lesions of aspergillosis--possibly not caused by A. fumigatus
but the result was the same.
There were no other cases until some time later and after the com-
mencement of the rains, when we had moved to another place which
had around it a fairly large area of grass. Here the cages were arranged
in an open sided hut, some facing east and some west, and it was
from the western side that the prevailing winds and breezes came.
After a week or two the disease reappeared, this time in two Ground
Thrushes (Geokichla earneronensis ), birds which inhabit the dense forest

where, no doubt, this type of mould does not exist, and I thought at
the time that it might have come from the decayed palm fibre that
was used as covering for their cage trays.
Later there were more cases--two Blue-shouldered Robin Ghats,
a Forest Robin, a Chestnut-crowned Bush Shrike, and a Yellow-billed
Barbet, but when, at last, I got some potassium iodide and gave it
in the proportion of one grain dissolved in warm water and mixed
with a medium-sized basin of food, there were no further cases among
the birds that ate the food, though there were among those that did
not--two more Yellow-billed Barbets, a Spotted Bulbul and a Pyrrhurus
simplex (all of which were living on fruit and had not taken to eating
any of the insectile mixture), a Nigrita canicapilla and a j*uvenile Black
Sparrow Hawk.
I noticed that nearly all the cases were among birds facing west, the
side of the prevailing breezes, and it is strange that Yellow-billed
Barbets were so susceptible.
Gray, in Diseases of Cage and Aviary Birds (pp. 14 and 15) says,
" It occurs more often in Canaries than in other cage birds, perhaps
for the reason that more people keep them. The Green Cardinal bred
in confinement is particularly liable to it. It is rare in Budgerigars.
" Direct sunlight, exposure to fresh air or violet rays, inhalations of
oxygen, sound seed free from mouldiness, fresh insect life and green
vegetables are not only preventives but also curatives.
" Iodide of potassium, Lugol's solution of iodine or solution of
calcium iodinate in the drinking water has a deleterious effect on the
mould in the system.
" Steaming with boiling water containing compound tincture of
benzoin or oil of eucalyptus or exposure to the vapours of the cresolene
lamp should be tried."
Sunlight, fresh air and green food do not prevent it among such
grazers as Brent and Wigeon, and it is doubtful, owing to the rapid
course run by the disease, whether there is any effective curative
treatment.
There is, however, some reason to believe that potassium iodide is
a prophylactic, for apart from the experience with the Cameroons
birds we found at Sterrebeek that there were very few--I believe none,
but do not recollect with certainty--cases among Long-tailed ducklings
in 1939 when potassium iodide was given, whereas in 1938 there were
a number.
It has been said that aspergillosis can be confused with tuberculosis,
but I feel sure that there is no mistaking either the symptoms or the
lesions, and the bluish spores can sometimes be seen on the whitish
yellow growths that form in air spaces and lungs.
The symptoms vary a little and there is not always at first a difficulty
in breathing (though towards the end there always is) depending on

whether the lungs are diseased or not, for sometimes the growths
form round about the heart and cause death by pressure on the heart,
while the lungs may remain fairly free from growths or congestion
and in these cases the bird lives a little longer.
The duration seems to depend a lot on this and the size of the bird,
---Geese, for instance, will linger for some time, while small birds may
die within a few days.
The birds, of course, look ill and do not feed.
Mercifully the disease is not, in the general way, such a menace in
this country as to warrant any special preventive measures beyond
avoiding the use of hay where possible and, of course, mouldy grain
of any kind. For such susceptible sea-birds as I believe some of the
Penguins are, the provision of sea-water might be worth a trial.

Blue Mountain and Scaly Lorikeets make the most delightful of
subjects flying at complete liberty. They can be trained without much
trouble to return to their aviary for food and shelter. Probably the
best way to do this would be to have mated pairs in an aviary which
must be provided with sleeping logs. When the birds are thoroughly
accustomed to their surroundings let one of them out in the morning.
It should stay about calling to its mate. Food could be left on the
aviary but taken away later in the day. By evening the bird will be
hungry and easily induced back through a small opening in the aviary.
My birds gained their freedom quite by accident. I had a pair of
Scalys and what proved to be two cock Blue Mountains. I had kept
them in the usual way in an aviary for three or four years. I might add
here that during this time the Scalys nested several times but never
succeeded in rearing their young. Two eggs only were laid to a clutch.
After moving to a new district the birds were put into a triangular
wire netting chicken coop in which a log was set up for them to sleep.
They were to have remained there until their aviary was finished.
However, a week or so later, the hen Scaly escaped. She spent most
of her time flying about in the trees near and by evening was back
again in the coop. I searched but could not find how she had got out.
Next day she was out again and as before went back of her own
accord. By watching I discovered the hole in a corner near the bottom
of the coop. As she always found her way in and out but none of the
others attempted to follow her I left the hole open. For a couple of
weeks she went out each day returning whenever she wanted to.
Then by some accident the door fell in and all of the birds were flying

loose. I looked at them in dismay, but that evening to my surprise
both Blue Mountains could be heard squabbling in their log and the
Scalys were sitting on top of it as usual. From then on the door of
the coop was left open and only shut at night as a precaution against
owls and cats. The birds had complete liberty for over a year following
this and always they returned to their coop at night and, of course,
their food was left there each day. I later moved the log nearer the
house and they were fed there. When hungry their screeches could be
heard at the back door and they even came inside. They flew about
amongst the trees and it was most fascinating to watch their queer,
grotesque antics while playing, generally upside down, clinging to
some downward-hanging gum branches. Their lovely colours were
particularly beautiful in their own natural surroundings. One could
but wonder what need there could be for keeping these lovely creatures
in an aviary when they could be kept so much easier together and to
so much better advantage just at liberty! All four agreed well together
for some months till one day the cock Scaly was picked up dead. Then the
hen Scaly chose one of the Blue Mountain cocks as her mate and later
the odd Blue Mountain cock met with an accident. The end came
one very hot day when both birds were found dead in a drum half
filled with water. Perhaps it was a love pact ! Anyhow they were
a devoted couple. A word as to their feeding. These Lorikeets and also
the Swift Parrot are provided with very curious brushlike tongues
specially suited to the kind of food they live upon, this being nectar
and fruit. In an aviary they should on no account be forced to live
upon hard, dry seed. This will result in the loss of sheen in their
feathering and will bring about fits which nearly always prove fatal.
Mine were fed on milk sweetened with honey in which a piece of
stale bread was left to soak. For fruit apples were preferred. I
hope this account may induce some other bird-lover to try a similar
experiment.
I made a model of the birds as they appeared in characteristic
attitude while playing, and these and a model of a Regent Bower Bird
(1 Sericulus chrysocephalus) are shown on the accompanying plate. The
models are made of wood, which is carved, wire and tin, painted
with the natural colours of the birds. The Blue Gum leaves with
the Blue Mountain Lorikeets and the Queen Wattle with the Bower
Bird are made of similar materials.

Millions of years ago a cataclysmic upheaval of the earth completely
separated New Zealand from Australia and Asia, cutting off the south-
ward drift of mammals. As a result New Zealand became a country
of interdependent forest and birds.
The Maoris introduced the first mammals, the dog and the rat, in
about 1350. Four hundred years later Captain Cook, and then the
early settlers, brought more mammals into the country, so that,
almost immediately, the bird population began to decline. Now so
much bush country has been cleared that many species have become
extinct or are threatened with this fate.
The accounts of the first ornithologists to reach New Zealand are so
full of vivid descriptions of interesting, unusual, and beautiful birds,
that any visitor interested in ornithology who has read some of these

accounts is bound to be disappointed when he first arrives in the
country.
There are many introduced species of British birds to be found
almost everywhere. Goldfinches, Greenfinches, Redpolls, Chaffinches,
Yellow Buntings, Song Thrushes, Blackbirds, Starlings, and Skylarks
are all common in the North Island and the ubiquitous Sparrow has
become a pest. Other introduced species which have become numerous
include the Australian White-backed Magpie and the Mynah. In
some areas Rosella Parrakeets occur in large numbers and, near
Hunterville, Sulphur-crested Cockatoos breed freely and manage to
maintain their numbers in spite of relentless persecution by the
farmers.
Of the native birds only a few can be described as reasonably
common. Fantail Flycatchers and Zosterops can be seen in most
gardens even in the largest towns. There are two " Fantails ". The
black species (Rhipidura flabellifera ) is quite rare and is found mainly
in the South Island, but the Pied Fantail (R. fuliginosa ) is common
throughout the Dominion. The pied species has a chestnut breast,
brown wings, and a brown and white streaked tail, which is slightly
longer than the remainder of the bird and which it spreads into an
attractive fan, enabling it to perform remarkable aerial feats. In size
the Fantails are slightly smaller than the British Robin. They occur in
light bush country rather than in dense forests, are extremely tame and
confiding, and can be persuaded to enter homes where they make
a comprehensive search for insects. Most, if not all, of their food of
flies, mosquitoes, and midges is taken on the wing, and they usually
hunt in pairs. The nest is finely woven of twigs, hair, and moss, and is
generally suspended from a leafy branch overhanging running water.
The eggs are white with brownish spots at the larger end, four form the
normal clutch, and usually three broods are reared each year. Their
tameness and beauty make them general favourites, and the New
Zealander contemplates the Fantail with the same fondness as that
with which we regard our Robin.
New Zealand Zosterops (Zosterops halnaturina ) are well known to
English aviculturists, but I doubt if there are many in the country
to-day. In May and June they arrive in the gardens here in large
numbers, and fruit trees become covered with them hunting for insects.
With the approach of spring they migrate into the bush to nest. It is
thought that they arrived in New Zealand after having been blown
across the Tasman Sea in about i860, since when they have become
firmly established. It is to be hoped that a few pairs will find their way
to England soon, where they should be encouraged to breed in large
planted aviaries rather than kept in cages for show purposes alone,
which has been done so often in the past.
There is much controversy as to which New Zealand Honeyeater is

the better songster, the Bell-bird or the Tui. The Bell-bird ( Anthornis
melanura ) is about the size of a Thrush ; its general plumage is
yellowish olive, the head is black, and the wings and tail are brownish
black. The eye is bright red, the beak is curved and black, and the
legs and feet are grey. Its song is probably richer and more varied
than that of the Tui. Bell-birds have recently increased rapidly in
numbers, but they are shy and can be seen only in secluded wooded
areas. Even there they are difficult to observe, for their colouring
harmonizes well with their surroundings. They feed mainly on berries
and insects. Their flat nest is built not far up from the ground and is
constructed of moss and grass lined with feathers.
The Tui or Parson Bird ( Prosthemadera nova seelandia) is found
throughout the Dominion in fairly large numbers. It is mainly a glossy
greenish black with two conspicuous white feather tufts adorning its
throat, but its beauty in the sunlight is indescribable. It is a large bird,
about the size of a Jackdaw, and in flight its wings make a pleasant
rustling sound. Its nest is built at the top of a leafy tree and is an
untidy structure lined with Punga (Tree Fern) down. It feeds on
nectar, berries, and insects.
Sacred Kingfishers [Halcyon sanctus) can be seen frequently during
the winter perched on telegraph wires often above busy roads near
the towns. Their cream breasts and abdomens, green and blue wings,
blue tails and rumps, and blue heads, combined with their typical
Kingfisher appearance, make them easy to identify. These birds feed
mainly on large insects and seldom on fish. They nest in hollow trees
usually near water.
The better known Parrot-like birds peculiar to New Zealand are
the Kea [Nestor notabilis ), the Kaka [Nestor meridionalis) , the Kakapo
[Strigops habroptilus) , and the Red-fronted and Yellow-fronted
Parrakeets [Cyanorhamphus nova-zealandia and C. auriceps ). Several
examples of the Kea can still be seen in the snow country of the
Southern Alps, where they make their nests in rock crevices high up
in the mountainous country. The Kaka was once common in forest
country but now few, if any, remain to be seen. In size and shape it
resembles the Kea, but differs in colour, which is brownish red. It
feeds mainly on grubs and it nests in hollow trees. The Kakapo or
New Zealand Ground Parrot is remarkable for having lost its power
of flight. It is considerably larger than the Kea and Kaka, its plumage
is mainly green, and in some respects it resembles a large owl. It is
most active at night, runs strongly, and climbs actively. Unfortunately
few living specimens remain. Few Parrakeets exist on the Mainland,
but they occur in small numbers on Island Sanctuaries, e.g. Kapiti
Island. The Red-fronted and Yellow-fronted species make excellent
aviary birds, become very tame, are not difficult to keep successfully,
and breed freely.

28 J. R. HODGES-NOTES ON BIRDS OF NEW ZEALAND
Two species of Cuckoo migrate from the Pacific Islands to New
Zealand, where they remain from September to April. They are the
Shining and Long-tailed Cuckoos (Lamprococcyx lucidus and Eudynamis
taitensis ), both of which lay their single egg in the nest of the pretty and
common Grey Warbler.
One of the most attractive of all New Zealand birds is the Native
Wood Pigeon ( Hemiphaga nova-zjalandid) . It is much larger and
considerably more brightly coloured than the British Wood Pigeon.
The head is golden green, the upper parts are coppery purple, the tail
is greyish green, and the lower breast and abdomen are pure white,
contrasting with the red legs and feet. It can be seen occasionally in
both the South and North Islands, but it is rapidly becoming more
scarce. It builds an untidy platform-like nest of twigs high up in dense
foliage. Its food consists almost entirely of berries, and it is important
economically as the main distributor of the seeds of forest trees.
Of the Rails the commonest are the Pukeko or Swamp Hen ( Porphyrio
melanotus) and the Weka or Wood Hen (Galliralius australis , etc.). The
Pukeko is very different from other Rails with its brilliant indigo and
black plumage and red legs. It frequents swampy inland areas where
it can be observed easily, searching for grubs and young shoots. In
flight, which is laboured and heavy, it trails its long red legs behind, and
makes a very striking picture. The Wekas, of which there are several
species, are mainly brown. Unlike the Pukeko, the Wood Hen has
no powers of flight and relies on its ability to run swiftly.
Along the coasts of New Zealand can be seen Red-billed Gulls,
Shags, Gannets, Petrels, Penguins, Albatrosses, and many other
interesting species of sea birds. But it is the birds of the bush and forests,
found in no other part of the world, which hold the greatest fascination
to the bird-lover, who must sadly contemplate the fact that so many
species have disappeared quite recently.
Government regulations prohibit the keeping of New Zealand
native birds, except Zosterops and Keas, in captivity, and the authori-
ties will not permit the export of any of these species even to well
known Zoological Institutions. There are a few bird sanctuaries, and
in many areas suitable trees have been planted to encourage the
increase of Tuis and Bell-birds. But still more species are disappearing.
The Huia has long been extinct, and soon probably the Saddleback,
the Blue- and Orange-wattled Crows, the Tomtits, the beautiful
Wrens, the Parrakeets, and many others will have disappeared com-
pletely. I am convinced that efforts to breed these birds under the
best conditions in captivity would meet with a certain amount of
success and save at least some species from complete extinction. One
or two aviculturists do keep New Zealand Parrakeets in captivity
where they breed well and regularly. But these men are breaking the
law and risk being prosecuted. At the Hawke's Bay Acclimatization

Farm, where they are permitted to keep Kiwis, two young birds have
been successfully reared, and when I visited the farm recently (Sep-
tember, 1948) the adult male was incubating another fertile egg. If
Kiwis can be preserved under controlled conditions surely many other
species can be saved in the same way.

BELGIAN AVIARIES
By Jean Delacour
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990449515151515" page_id="56311733"  page_num="29" year="" vol="">
Early in September, 1948, M. A. Decoux and I were the guests of
M. J. Bruyneel, at Steynockerzeel, near Brussels. M. Bruyneel
has kept various birds extensively for more than forty years, but he
now specializes in Parrots and Parrakeets. For a long time he has
acquired and bred many rare species and to-day his collection is
a remarkable one. There are hundreds of birds in his aviaries which
are placed in many groups throughout a large walled-in garden at
the back of his house. These aviaries are of the fixed type, compara-
tively small, with roomy, deep shelters at the back. That they are
suitable is proved by repeated successes with rare and difficult species.
M. Bruyneel is a true lover of birds and an expert aviculturist. His
birds are beautifully fed and cared for. They receive the best sorts of
seeds, green food, and fruit. It is true that there are now few restrictions
in Belgium, which makes his task easier than it would be in other
countries of Europe. But all through the war he managed to maintain
his collection, to breed many birds, and to provide them with the
necessary food, a great achievement. A large amount of the seeds and
fruit used are grown in his vast kitchen garden.
All the better known Australian Parrakeets -- Red and Mealy
Rosellas, Pennant's, Stanley's, Red-rumped, Barraband's, Rock
Pebblers, Crimson-wings--are present, often several pairs of each
species. There are many Queen Alexandra's, Blue-winged, Elegant,
Bourke's, Ground Parrakeets, a few Barnard's and Port Lincoln, Tur-
quoisines, five cock Scarlet-chested, a pair of Yellow Red-rumped,
and Many-coloured; two magnificent pairs of Leadbeater's, a still finer
pair of Moluccan, as well as two newly imported Gang-gangs, represent
the Cockatoo family. There are various Lovebirds, including Blue
Masked, and also Lories, mostly Red-Collared, a hen Red (Eos
horned) and a hen Purple Cap, which bred successfully for many
years with a cock of her own species which died a few years ago.
She has since produced a gorgeous hybrid with a male Red-Collared.
As hybrids go, there are two pairs of very beautiful birds, the result
of a cross between King and Crimson-winged Parrakeets. The males

have scarlet crown, nape, neck, and breast, the sides of the head bright
green, the wing coverts yellow and red ; the markings are even and
one could easily mistake them for a true wild species. A hybrid Rock
Peplar X Crimson-wing is more like the latter, with the wing coverts
spotted yellow and red and a longer tail.
The last addition to the Bruyneel's aviaries has been a larger flight,
well sheltered by two walls, where he keeps successfully a varied and
lovely collection of Grass Parrakeets.
In M. Bruyneel's company we went to see Mme Y. Malisoux, at
Beez, near Namur. The loss of M. Yvan Malisoux, soon after the
liberation of Belgium, has deprived aviculture of one of the most
intelligent, observant, and capable breeders of Pheasants. Mme
Malisoux carries on courageously with a few rare species. To-day she
keeps three pairs of Satyrs and three of Blyth's Tragopans, the latter
being the only good stock left in captivity. This year 13 Satyrs and
2 Blyths have been reared; some of the Satyrs belong to the fifth
generation bred in captivity. They are extremely well fed and cared
for so that they have not deteriorated in the least degree. Mme
Malisoux also possesses a pair of Palawan Peacock-Pheasants, and
she has recently added Amhersts, Mikado, Grey Peacock Pheasants,
from the Leckford collection. During the war birds were kept and
reared at Beez quite successfully, particularly the difficult Indian
Koklas, which, Mme Malisoux says, gave no trouble at all, a happy
exception with these delicate mountain birds.
We saw at the Antwerp Zoo an extraordinary hybrid, raised a few
years ago from a Satyr Tragopan cock and a Swinhoe's hen, a queer,
long bird, with a short tail, a mottled purplish face, and large patches
of dark blue and bright mahogany red in the plumage. The only
hybrid produced by a Tragopan ever recorded was one between
a Temminck cock and a Koklas hen obtained in France over sixty
years ago.
We visited again the excellent Antwerp Zoo, which is improving
steadily under M. Van den begh's enthusiastic direction ; the
Rotterdam Zoo, very interesting and quite modern ; the Tilbury
Zoo, now owned by M. N. van Dijk, and the aviaries, exceptionally
clean, suitable and well kept of his brother, M. Henri van Dijk.
the famous dealer, the only one in Europe to-day to receive really
interesting collections of birds. Where are the days when bird shops
in England and in France were full of all sorts of feathered treasures ?
But they will return before too long, I hope, and the Avicultural
Society is working towards a restoration of more normal, less harsh
conditions than those existing since the beginning of the last war.

In response to inquiries from the Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural
Society the following details of breeding successes have kindly been
supplied by aviculturists in Australia in December, 1948 :--
From Mr. E. Hallstrom, Sydney.
In regard to the breeding of Australian and other Parrots, the
following list is from memory, and would be underestimated.
I have bred forty Macaws, twenty-eight of which were Red-and-
Yellow, and have a pair of Blue-and-Gold Macaws with chicks. I have
not examined the number.
I have also bred ten hybrids which are a cross between the Red-and-
Yellow and the Blue-and-Gold, and at the moment have more hybrids
in the nest.
A pair of Military Macaws are sitting on four eggs; I am not very
hopeful of the result as the male is very old. Many of the previous eggs
of this pair have been infertile, but in the last clutch a few were fertile
and I am hoping this present batch may bring forth some chicks.
I am breeding regularly Black Cockatoos (Banksian). I also have
White-tail and Yellow-tail Black Cockatoos, which have laid infertile
eggs.
I have bred the Gang Gang Cockatoo, Major Mitchell, White
Cockatoo, Galah, Blue Mountain Parrot, and Eclectus or Red-sided
Parrot.
Of the smaller Parrots I have bred Brown's, Eastern Rosella,
Moreton Bay Rosella, a hybrid between the Eastern Rosella and

Lovebirds, Yellow and ordinary Nyasa by hundreds, African Black
Cheeks, Masked Lovebird, Lutino Nyasa, Fischer's Lovebird, one
Yellow-naped Amazon.
In addition to these I have bred a Knysna Lourie. This bird is now
about one-third grown and is the strangest baby I have ever seen. It
left the nest as a tiny fledgling, and although not a quarter of the size
of its parents, can find its way back to the nest. The youngster is doing
very well, and is well cared for by the parents.
I also have some unnamed Parrots from New Guinea, which are
breeding at the present moment. The first lot of youngsters, after
three weeks, disappeared. The birds have been changed into different
aviaries and are now nesting again. I am hoping for better luck with
their next effort.

The breeding which I have referred to has taken place over the last
fifteen years, and is still going on. I do not keep a record, as I have so
much work to do as a refrigerator manufacturer that I do not want to
add to this by keeping close records of births of birds. If you wish to
have a record of some particular bird or birds I could get one of my
staff to follow them through this year if you consider it important
enough.
My aviaries contain over a thousand Parrots, excluding the
Budgerigars and African Lovebirds. As I close this letter I recall a
number of small American Parrots which have also been bred success-
fully in my aviaries.
From Mr. D. Martin, Warrnambool, Victoria.
I am only too pleased to let you have all the information you require.
I have been crossing Parrots for years and have had good hatches each
time. I have been crossing large Parrots with small ones and always
use the cock of the large species and hen of the small. Here are some of
the crosses :--
Western Australian King Parrot male X Red Rump (Grass Parrot)
female. Laid six eggs, hatched four and reared them, being three males
and one female. 18th November, 1946.
Yellow Rosella male x Red Rump (Grass Parrot) female. Laid six
eggs, hatched two, both being males. 12th December, 1947.
Cockatoo Parrot male X Blue-winged Grass Parrot female. Laid
five eggs, hatched four, reared three only, one dying at a week old,
one male, two females. 2nd December, 1947.
Stanley Rosella male x Red Rump (Grass Parrot) female. Laid
six eggs, hatched four, reared one only, being a hen; the three died on
the fourth, fifth, and eighth days. 27th November, 1947.
I crossed the same birds this year. They have hatched four birds,
out of six eggs and have reared the four--two males, two females.
</bodyText>
<footnote confidence="0.8661804">
5th November, 1948.
African Ringneck male x Crimson Rosella female. Laid six eggs,
hatched three, reared three--one female, two males. 20th October,
1948. All eggs not hatched were infertile.
Have also bred Apostle Birds in 1946 and 1947. King Parrots,

eggs, hatched three, reared one only, others killed by other birds when

two weeks old out to date this year. Have had a 50 per cent hatch and
have a number of eggs due out next week. Have fourteen kinds of
Parrots, six kinds of Quail, and lots of others.
From Mr. R. Probert, Oatley, N.S.W.
I have two male Barraband x Princess Alexandra hybrids which
were bred by me just on three years ago.
The colour at present is orange-red on forehead, rest of head, side
of face, neck, and wings, green, as in the Barraband Parrakeet.
Throat, chest, and down to vent, orange-red, mixed with some yellow
on the chest. Some of the feathers on the belly edged with pale blue.
The rump is bright blue and the sides of the body a paler blue. Wing
patch yellowish-green, somewhat similar to Princess Alexandra, under
tail-coverts pale blue and green. Upper tail green, intermediate in
colour between Barraband and Princess. Underside of tail black,
edged with pink. Beak red, eye orange-red.
Last season I bred two Barraband x Rock Pebbler, but one bird has
since died. The other is now twelve months old and is beginning to
moult into adult plumage, showing a few reddish-orange feathers on
the forehead and throat. The juvenile plumage is green, with
a yellowish wing-patch. The bird is apparently a cock. The male
parent was, of course, the Barraband in each of the above crosses.
The hen Rock Pebbler has eye disease at present, so I could not use
her for breeding purposes this year.
I also bred two young from a Pileated x Pale-headed Rosella last
year. These young may be a pair. The juvenile plumage is dull green
on head, neck, side of face, back, and wings. Red across the forehead
and pale blue cheek patch. Chest, greenish-blue, but one bird has now
moulted out to pale blue on the chest. Under tail-coverts and around legs
red, rump yellowish, with a patch or bar of red. Edge of wing blue. Tail,
green above and black and pale blue below, similar to the Pileated.
Bill, horn-coloured, and shaped like a Rosella's, but slightly longer.
Eyes brown. The male parent was the Pileated (Red-capped) Parrakeet.
At the present time I have four young Pileated Parrakeets in the nest.
They are due to fly in about a week's time. I do not know of anyone
breeding these birds previously in New South Wales.
The hen of the breeding pair is still in immature plumage and I
would think about twelve months old. She came over with a batch of
birds from Western Australia (Perth) some months ago and is quite
tame. It would appear that she is a bird that has been taken from the
nest (in the bush) and hand-reared.
I have bred Princess, Scarlet-chested, Hooded, and Indian Ring-
necks this season. I have some Varied Lorikeets in my aviaries, but
have not had them go to nest so far.

Members of the Club, 19 ; guests, 14 ; total, 33.
Mr. Seth-Smith showed a splendid selection from his collection of
slides to illustrate Courtship and Display among Birds. The species
depicted were Peacock, Amherst, Argus, Rheinart's Argus, Temminck's
Tragopan, Grey Peacock-Pheasant, Ocellated Turkey, Great, Lesser
Superb, and Hunstein's Magnificent Birds of Paradise, Ruff, Great
and Australian Bustards, Andean Goose, King Vulture, Sun Bittern,
and Kagu.
The displays of many of these species were photographed for the
first time by Mr. Seth-Smith, notably that of the Argus, Kagu, and
King Vulture, in fact that of the last named is unique.
The Sun Bittern was shown not giving a courtship but a warning
display. The whole talk and slides were of absorbing interest, and
well merited the applause given to the speaker.
Considerable discussion followed, in which many members took
part. Mr. Webb said he had kept a Sun Bittern in British Guiana
as a pet, and had seen it display at a dog, presumably with a view to
impressing the dog with its size, and thus using it as a protection.
He thought one of the most extraordinary displays was that of
Jackson's Whydah, which as part of its performance makes a series
of high jumps of between two and three feet. A bird of this species
had been kept at the Zoo for about sixteen years.
Mr. Norris considered the behaviour of birds in captivity approxi-

mated those in freedom. He described the " display " of his Lead-
beaters Cockatoo, but insisted that such exhibitions should be treated
with reserve.
Mr. Vane stressed the important part aviculture had played and
could play in the study of display ; much of what was known was due
to the observations of aviculturists. Mr. Seth-Smith had said the Zoo
had never succeeded in breeding the Great Bustard owing to infertility,
a condition possibly induced by the birds being pinioned. He thought
a more likely reason was .a diet deficiency, possibly lack of vitamin E,
which could be best supplied in the form of sprouting seed. In his
experience Parrakeets, notably Bourke's, that ate sprouting seed bred
successfully, whereas those that did not, often produced infertile eggs.
Mr. Ezra remarked that his Cranes were pinioned ; the operation
had certainly not affected their fertility, as they bred every year.
Mr. Vane then said Mr. Seth-Smith had referred to past breeding
successes at the Zoo. He would like to know why greater efforts
were not being made now. At Whipsnade during the past year or
so great strides had been made in the breeding of Pheasants and
Waterfowl. Could not similar efforts be made with Parrakeets ?
Dr. Hindle replied that the Zoo's list of birds bred in the past was
formidable. Present-day conditions prevented anything much in the
breeding line. The Gardens occupied a comparatively small area,
and it was not possible to allot space to aviaries solely for breeding
purposes. Apart from which, the enormous number of visitors would
make it impossible to provide the necessary seclusion. Whipsnade
was not too favourably situated for the purpose of breeding Parrakeets
and other birds ; the Park was in a somewhat bleak position. It
would be useless to attempt breeding on an extensive scale without
properly constructed aviaries, not just shelters. Shortage of material
and various restrictions prevented anything being done for the present.
Mr. Seth-Smith agreed.
Mr. Dulanty observed that some years ago Mr. Teschemaker was
very successful in keeping and breeding small insectivorous birds in
well-planted, open aviaries without shelters. Mr. Seth-Smith, how-
ever, pointed out that these were in a far better location in Devon.
Well-planted aviaries were, of course, impracticable for Parrakeets.
Mr. Vane said that during the past few years, when it had been
virtually impossible to construct new aviaries, or for that matter to
repair old, aviculturists had found that large, movable aviaries were
not essential to ensure the health of the occupants. Some remarkable
breeding results had been obtained in quite small, fixed aviaries, and
the stamina of the stock maintained. Under these conditions he had
bred various species to the third generation, without the slightest
deterioration.
Dr. Amsler asked Mr. Vane what he considered a desirable length

of flight, and he replied fifteen to eighteen feet. Dr. Amsler said that
some years ago he had a pair of Rosellas in a small aviary, 9 feet by
3 feet by 6 feet high. Seventeen young were reared from clutches of
ten and seven, and left together with their parents for want of room
until the end of the season. The sight of these nineteen birds in one
small flight was almost suggestive of a dealer's stock-cage.
Dr. Kindle asked Mr. Seth-Smith whether he had any theory as to
why birds displayed. Mr. Seth-Smith replied that it was mainly to
increase the ardour of the female, a sexual stimulant. It was extra-
ordinary that Birds of Paradise had developed such specialized plum-
age, and should indulge in such elaborate forms of display, whereas
at the other end of the scale birds like the Hedge Sparrow, in which
the sexes were almost identical, should have little or no display of
any kind.
Mr. Floyd and Mr. Murray also took part in the discussion.
The next meeting of the Club will be on Tuesday, 15 th March, 1949 .

REVIEW
BIRDS OF A VALLEY. By W. R. Philipson. (Longmans. 10s. 6 d.)

<bodyText confidence="0.990366263157895" page_id="56311740"  page_num="36" year="" vol="">
Mr. Philipson's book is a quiet account of some time spent watching
the birds of the Lakeland valley at the southern end of Ullswater. How
long he spent in this district is not made clear, although his descriptions
cover all the seasons of the year. He gives much space to careful and
detailed accounts of the display of many species which nest or migrate
through the dale, to the incubation and development of nestlings of
some common birds, and the feeding habits of Dipper, Woodcock, and
some of the migratory ducks which rest on Brothers Water. Of the
two more general chapters the one on migration may be a useful
summary for bird lovers, and that on roosting incorporates the author's
own observations from outside the district. Mention is also made of
Peregrine Falcon and Raven, but the author does not convey the
grandeur of the high fells, where these two are the dominant species.
A whole chapter is devoted to the Buzzard; it would be strange if the
birds of this small area should differ from others in the district in failing
to decorate their nests with a fresh green sprig ; lastly, Mr. Philipson
can be assured that he has not seen the last pair of tree-nesting
Buzzards in the Lake District.

A. Decoux has been fortunate in obtaining a pair of imported
Forsten's Lorikeets and a pair of the very rare Blue-faced Lorikeet
(Trichoglossus capistratus ).
Cecil Webb has been very ill with malaria and various other diseases
contracted during his last collecting trip to British Cameroons. Readers
will be pleased to know he is now recuperating nicely.
Dave Bush expected to bring a collection from Australia for the
London Zoo, but the authorities decided it would be safer to wait until
the spring. In the meantime, he has been collecting Palm Cockatoos,
Birds of Paradise, Tree-Kangaroos, etc., in New Guinea.
H. A. Fooks has joined the Nigerian Forest Service and is leaving
shortly for Nigeria. He is, however, keeping on his farm in Sussex.
He will be pleased to hear from any members interested in obtaining
local animals and birds.
Mrs. Nancy Edgar Smith last spring reared two Cereopsis Geese.
They were full-winged at complete liberty. One has just met a tragic
end by flying into a hydro-electric wire. Mrs. Smith had previously
reared one young one which went to Peter Scott's collection.
Guy Falkner is now resident in Natal. In a recent letter he says he is
hand-rearing a young Mynah. " They were imported here from India
and, like the Grey Squirrel, have taken over from many of the native
birds." He is also rearing a young Pied Starling--entirely African and
very local--and a pair of Cape Spotted Pigeons. A pair of Stanley
Cranes were nesting on his land, " very common here."
Francis H. Rudkin, the doyen of American aviculturists but, of
course, English by birth, now age 88, still maintains a very extensive
collection of Parrot-like birds. In a recent list he gives over 260
Psittacines, in addition to 230 Lovebirds, including twenty-five pairs
of Masked, blue variety. Breeding successes this year have been com-
paratively few, owing to rebuilding the aviaries, but two Leadbeater's
and one Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoo were reared. He has recently
been elected President Emeritus of the Avicultural Society of America,
in succession to the late Mr. W. H. Browning. F. H. R., jun., is coming
to England next summer and hopes to meet English aviculturists.

Additions to the London Zoo.
October, 1948. The new arrivals, apart from transfers from Whipsnade, numbered
twenty-two. A small collection was received in exchange from the National Zoological
Park, Washington, and consisted of 1 American Crow ( Corvus hrachyrhynchos) , 2 Blue
Jays ( Cyanocitta cristata ), 2 Mexican Rose Finches ( Carpodacus mexicanus), 1 Northern
Mocking-bird (Mimus polyglottos) , and 4 Bob Whites ( Colinus virginianus).
A Black Kite ( Milvus migrans ) was presented by Mr. R. Stevens, and a Western
Bluebird ( Sialia mexicana occidentals) was received in exchange, otherwise there was
nothing of special note.

November, 1948. There were sixteen new arrivals during the month. The more
interesting were 2 Blue-winged Geese ( Cyanochen cyanoptera) from Abyssinia ; 1 Turn-
stone ( Arenaria interpres ) picked up at Romford ; and 1 hybrid Chinese
Silver X Edwards' Pheasant, bred in the Menagerie. 11 o Budgerigars, bred in the
Menagerie during 1948, were taken on the strength.

Snow and Lapland Buntings.
Once more I would impress on members the importance of recording in the
Magazine all breedings, whether in their own aviaries or in those of acquaintances.
I had always supposed these Buntings to be very difficult to breed in captivity,
based on the fact that in my files I have only the following records :--
" Snow Bunting. Bred by G. T. Kay, Lerwick, Shetland Isles, in 1942, after
twenty years endeavour. Two young ones were hatched 3rd July ; one bird died
during the moult in September, and the other in December (account by the
breeder in Avicultural Magazine, 1944, 106).
" Lapland Bunting. In 1933 Teschemaker sent Dr. Hopkinson some extracts
from his old notebooks, among which is the record of the breeding by him of this
Bunting in 1916. Three young were hatched, i8th-20th June, and one of them
lived in his aviary for a year or more. Teschemaker wrote that he sent details
to Cage Birds, but only to the correspondence column."
Now, quite by chance, I learn that W. H. Smith, of Grimsby, has bred both Buntings
on several occasions and apparently has not attached any great importance to the
successes. He has had both species in his aviaries for the past ten years and has bred
with them most years. Usually it is the second or third year when they commence to
breed. Nests are made on the ground in a layer of sand and grit, with tufts of dry grass
and heather planted in it. Last year three Lapland and two Snow Buntings were
reared, but one Lapland died when it was well on the wing.
In view of the foregoing it is possible other breeders have been successful, in which
event I would be interested to have particulars.

The National Cage Bird Show.
The National Exhibition of Cage Birds was held at the Royal Horticultural (New)
Hall on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th December, 1948. It was organized by Cage Birds and the
proceeds are to be divided between the Forces Help Society and the National Council
of Aviculture.
The Foreign Section attracted 144 entries--an increase of forty-one on last year--
and was judged by E. N. T. Vane.
The National Award of Merit for the best foreign bird and National Foreign Bird
Silver Trophy were awarded to A. Ezra for his Brown-eared Bulbul.
The Psittacine classes received better support than last year, forty-seven entries.
The class winners were E. F. Benjamin's Masked Lovebird, W. P. Bland's Bourke's
Parrakeet, C. Laidman's Plum-headed Parrakeet (Best Parrot-like Exhibit), A. Ezra's
Green-winged King Parrakeet, and P. A. Birch's superb pair of Yellow-cheeked
Parrots. There were twenty-three entries in the class for common Waxbills,
Mannikins, etc., and this was won by T. Crewes' Golden-breasted Waxbills, followed
by P. Barnes' St. Helena Waxbills and T. Crewes' Zebra Waxbills.
The rarer species of Waxbills and Mannikins class provided a win for T. Crewes'
Chestnut-breasted. A pair of Rufous-necked Weavers won the Whydahs and Weavers
class for A. Ezra ; the Parrot Finches and Gouldian class was won by T. Crewes's
Red-headed Parrot Finches.
The class for Grassfinches and the rarer small seedeaters provided T. Crewes with
his fourth premier award; in addition his birds occupied six of the first seven positions.
His leading birds were Melba Finches, Golden-breasted Buntings, and White Java
Sparrows : A. Ezra's Gay's Finch was second, and prevented a clean sweep.
The small insectivorous bird class produced twelve entries, including five Sunbirds.
A. Ezra was first and third with Collared and Double-collared, and T. Crewes second
with a pair of Zosterops.
The class for medium-size insectivorous birds was won by A. Ezra's Brown-eared
Bulbul (Best Foreign Bird), with his Rothschild's Grackle third, and T. Crewes'
Golden-fronted Fruitsucker second.
The best of the larger insectivorous birds was G. C. Lynch's well-known Donaldson's
Touracou with its companion, the Blue Satin Bower Bird, third, the gap being filled
by T. CorralPs Eastern Pie.
The remaining class for lutinos, hybrids, etc., was won by J. E. Williams' Blue-
winged X Turquoisine Parrakeet, with C. Gunton's Green Singing Finch X Canary.

The Duke of Bedford's Birds.
Members, especially those resident abroad, occasionally inquire whether the Duke
of Bedford is still actively interested in aviculture. The Duke's many activities prevent
his devoting the time he would wish to " this most amiable pursuit ", but he manages
to maintain a small but very interesting collection. The principal birds are :--
Solitary Lory, one pair.
Goupil's Lorikeet, three males, one female, and one young one bred last year.
</bodyText>
<reference confidence="0.751584214285714">
Gang-Gang Cockatoo, one pair.
Roseate Cockatoo, three males and one female, albino and albino-bred.
Queen of Bavaria's Conure, female.
Blue-fronted Amazon, lutino, female.
Derbyan Parrakeet, one pair and one sex unknown.
Malabar Parrakeet, female.
Green-winged King Parrakeet, male.
Pileated Parrakeet, one pair.

London. Inquiry at the Constable's Office revealed that there are at present six
birds, the full establishment.

AVIAN IMPORTS

<bodyText confidence="0.967557" page_id="56311744"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
A few days ago I went to the Import Licensing Department of the Board of Trade
in order to inquire about the regulations governing the importation of birds and was
informed that, apart from a possible exception in the case of those required for
scientific research, there is a ban on all birds and snakes.
The official view seems to be that any small bird will eat seed, and the order is
evidently worded in such a way that quadrupeds (excepting horses and cattle) may
be imported freely, together with those of doubtful quadrupedal qualifications, such
as monkeys, and so we have the Gilbertian situation of a lizard with four feet being
admitted and all legless lizards or snakes being excluded.
It is apparently only the small birds that peck away the foundations of the country's
economic structure, for I was told later that permits might be granted for large birds,
such as Cranes or Flamingoes, destined for zoos.
An hour or so later I went into a dealer's shop (where, incidentally, I saw three
Greater Spotted Woodpeckers and wondered if they conformed to the law by being
aviary-bred and close-ringed) and, on inquiring if they had any foreign birds, was
offered Silverbills and Mannikins at #2 ioj - . per pair.
These were not actually on view but they were, I was assured, recently brought into
the country by someone and would soon be in the shop. And so the farce goes on.
Binstead,
Isle of Wight.
John Ye all and.
(Mr. Yealland's experience is similar to that of several other members who have
approached the Board of Trade. While steadfastly refusing to grant import licences
to any except zoos, they seem entirely unable to give any reason for their attitude.
The sympathy of a well-known M.P. has been enlisted and he has taken up the
question with the appropriate Department, but without getting a satisfactory reply.
He has now formulated a question to be put on the Order Paper and answered on the
floor of the House.--A. A. P.)

THE BLACK-CAPPED SOCIAL WEAVER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.967977545454546" page_id="56311744"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
I see Mr. Webb writes in the Magazine that he thinks the Weaver I wrote about was
not the Black-capped Social Weaver. I am fairly confident that it is. I watched them
through field-glasses and made note of their colour at the time and directly on my
return to Nairobi went through the skins at the Corydon Museum and picked out
the bird from the notes I had made. Mr. Webb may be right and very likely is.
Until someone who is an authority on the Weavers can put me right " my guess is
as good as anyone else's ". I sent some photos of the birds at the nests to MissBarclay-
Smith when I sent the article but they were too small for reproduction, otherwise
they might have cleared the matter up. If I have described the bird inaccurately
I must apologize to the readers of the Magazine, but can only state what I saw and the
conclusion I came to after examining the skins.

THE BIRD COLLECTION AT DUDLEY ZOO
By George A. J. Weaver, F.Z.S.
Dudley Castle is situated in the heart of an industrial area in the
Midlands and commands an excellent view of the surrounding
countryside. This ancient castle, for centuries the seat of the Earls
of Dudley, is mentioned in the Domesday Book, although it is thought
to have been in existence some hundreds of years prior to this. The
present Earl conceived the idea of creating a Zoo in the castle grounds
and ruins, and work commenced in the early 1930's. On 6th May,
1937, the Zoo was opened to the public under the chairmanship of
the late Mr. A. E. Marsh, this position now being held by his son.
Mr. E. E. Marsh, and some months ago the Dudley Zoological Society
became a public company.
As with many such institutions, Dudley suffered badly during the
war and by 1946 the enclosures and buildings were in sad need of
repair and stock had dwindled to a mere handful. The Society was
extremely fortunate about this time in obtaining the services of
Mr. D. Bowles, B.Sc., as General Manager, and as a result of his
energetic and untiring efforts the Zoo again began to take shape, and
to-day it houses a fine collection of exhibits, under far better conditions
than it did pre-war. Repairs have been speedily effected, fresh stock
acquired (we all know the pitfalls abounding in this direction), and
thousands of bulbs have been planted to brighten the gardens in
spring.
The original features of the Castle have been fully utilized in the
planning of the Zoo, as, for example, the moat, which to-day is
divided into sections to house seals and waterfowl. Although not a
large collection compared with that of Regent's Park, the birds kept
at Dudley are a representative selection and one is greatly impressed
by the fine condition in which all specimens appear to be. The manage-
ment and staff should be complimented on maintaining such good
health and general appearance amongst their charges, particularly

42 G. A. J. WEAVER--THE BIRD COLLECTION AT DUDLEY ZOO
during the present trying times when proper foodstuffs are difficult to
obtain.
Sharing with ruminants the larger paddocks, some of which must
be an acre or more in extent, will be found examples of Sarus,
Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes, Black-shouldered Peafowl (which
successfully reared chicks last season), and Red Junglefowl. The Sarus
has, I believe, been in the collection some fifteen years and is a fine old
bird. Another paddock is devoted to four Emus, unfortunately all
male birds, which, of course, is a setback where breeding is concerned.
However, they prove an interesting exhibit and serve to illustrate to
the general public the size attained by some species.
The Bird of Prey avairies contain fine examples of Buzzard,
Caracara, Bateleur Eagle, Griffon Vultures, Milky Eagle-Owl, Cape
Owl, and Brown Owl. The Vultures built a nest in February, 1939,
but did not achieve any success in hatching young.
The Pheasantry at Dudley is circular in design and is divided into
compartments housing outstanding pairs of Impeyans, Blue Crossop-
tilons, and Edwards, the first two species being recent acquisitions
from Leckford. Others of this family to be seen are Goldens, Silvers,
Amherst (pure), Melanistic Mutants, and a few of mixed ancestry.
My only regret is that space does not permit the housing of these
beautiful birds in more spacious enclosures, an impossibility, alas !
with many of our Zoos. An excellent specimen of a Red-legged
Partridge is also on view and deserves mention.
There are several ranges of outdoor avairies dotted about the
grounds, and amongst these will be found a nice collection of Budgies
of various colours. Other compartments contain pairs of Cockatiels,
Golden-mantled Rosellas, Redrumps, Indian Ringnecks, Roseate
Cockatoos, and Senegals.
Another circular building is the Bird House, which is constructed
of concrete and contains a fine selection of exotic species, Psittacines
being particularly well represented. Here the visitor will find examples
of Goffins, Citron-crested, Gang-Gang, Lesser and Greater Sulphur-
crested Cockatoos, Stanleys and Alexandrine Parrakeets, Peach-faced
Lovebirds, Festives, Yellow-fronted, Blue-fronted, and Red-topped
Amazons, a White-fronted Caique, Red and Blue, Red and Yellow,
and Illiger's Macaws, African Greys, and Purple-capped and Black-
capped Lories. The last named has recently laid two eggs but
unfortunately was not paired. Others of this family expected shortly
are Plumheads, Golden-fronted Conures, and Pennants.
A large enclosure in the Bird House houses two superb specimens
of Hartloub's Touracou in excellent condition and extremely tame.
These birds, together with a pair of Ground Hornbills and various
animals, etc., were brought back from Africa by the Head Keeper,
Mr. H. Hatch, who also supervised the transportation and safe

delivery of a pair of hippos to Regent's Park. Another large compart-
ment is devoted to the smaller Finches, including Bishops, Delamere,
and Pintail Whydahs, Gordon Bleus, St. Helena Waxbills, Fire
Finches, Avadavats, Reichnow's Weavers, and a Red-crested Cardinal.
Perhaps the most novel construction at the Zoo is the section
devoted to wildfowl, which, as previously mentioned, is part of the old
moat. Grass-covered banks, dotted with bushes, slope down to
concrete pools and in the various pens of this section are to be found
a nice selection of Ducks, Geese, etc. The ornithologist in particular
would immediately be taken by two flawless pairs of Red-crested
Pochard, a species rarely encountered by the average bird-watcher
unless he be in the happy position that enables him to travel far
afield and seek out such rarities. Colour is provided in these pens by
Mandarins and Carolinas, while other species of Duck include Gape
Teal, Ruddy Sheldduck, Rosybill, Falcated Teal, Wigeon, and Pintail.
A fairly wide variety of Geese are also on view, consisting of Spur-
wings, Greater White and Blue Snow Geese, Barheads, Egyptian,
Abyssinian, Canadian, Chinese, and Emden. Pairs of Black and
Mute Swans are also on show, other water-loving species including
Flamingoes, White Pelicans, Gannets, and Common Gulls.
Apart from a number of domestic and fancy Pigeons there are a few
Turtle Doves, a Red Mountain Dove, Olive Pigeons, and a pair of
Bronze-winged Pigeons. Other birds not yet mentioned include
Ravens, Linnets, Jackdaws, Goldfinches, Guinea Fowl, and some
fancy Bantams and Ducks.
The above list contains some ninety odd different species, the total
number of birds being somewhere in the region of 230. This is a great
improvement since 1946, and with further additions expected, will
provide excellent interest to the aviculturist and ornithologist who can
find the time to pay Dudley Zoo a visit.

(i) Cockatiel (.Leptolophus hollandicus)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.991378184210526" page_id="56311754"  page_num="44" year="" vol="">
Synonyms. --Cockatoo Parrot, Quarrion (in Queensland and in parts
of New South Wales), Weero (in Western Australia).
Distribution. --Occurs over most of Australia ; is commoner in the
northern parts and is rarely seen near the coast in the south.
Description. --The adult male is a slim, crested Parrot, whose pre-
vailing colour is grey, relieved by a broad white band on the outer
wing-coverts. The forehead, face, and base of the crest is yellow and
the ear-coverts are orange ; the tip of the crest is greyish-black.
The adult female has duller orange ear-coverts and a rather dirty
yellow face, the grey of the under parts and rump is freckled with
creamy yellow and the tail feathers are also similarly spotted, the two
lateral ones being more yellow than grey.
Immatures resemble the female on leaving the nest, but young
males usually show a slightly brighter yellow on and around the face ;
they usually assume the adult facial colouration when about five or
six months old, but retain the speckled tail feathers until the first
complete moult.
Variations. --Several subspecies have been described, but minor
variations are common in a number of birds from any given locality,
especially in the hens.
Coloured Plates. --Good plates are not common ; that in Greene
(vol. i, p. 33) portrays the colouring of the male fairly accurately
but gives the bird a fore-shortened appearance. Roland Green's plate
in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 239) is quite good, except that the male has
rather a pale face, while that of the female is too grey, and does not
show the dirty yellow tinge.
Field Notes. --I have seen this bird in South Queensland on several
occasions, either in pairs or in what appeared to be small family
parties from the presence of a single adult male in the group.
Aviary Notes. --A very well known aviary bird, which has been kept
and bred extensively, both in Australia and abroad. It is an excellent
bird for a mixed collection as it agrees well with other Parrots and
also with birds of other orders. It is one of the few Parrots that can
be bred in a mixed collection, as a pair will often quietly but firmly
appropriate a log and are usually able to defend it successfully against
the most aggressive of the broadtails ; it can also be bred in a colony,
provided there is not an excess of cock birds and that reasonable space
is provided.

My first experience in breeding this species was in 1935-6. A pair
obtained in August of the former year nested in November and hatched
two young from a clutch of five eggs ; only .one of these survived and
it left the nest in mid-January ; it proved to be a cock and had
attained adult facial plumage in July. Three further young were
hatched in March but did not survive long. In the spring of 1936
four eggs had been laid by 20th September and five young were seen
on 13th October, these were all reared and left the log between the
12th and 19th November. A second clutch was started immediately
thereafter, but none of this or a subsequent clutch laid in January
were reared successfully. In the spring of 1937 eggs were laid in the
middle of August and four young left the nest between the 10th and
17th October. The second clutch, consisting of six eggs, was completed
by the end of October ; all of these were hatched and reared, the
last leaving the nest on Christmas Eve.
Since then I have bred a good many Cockatiels, but seldom more
than two or three to a clutch. The birds have usually had three or
four clutches each season, but have invariably spoilt one or more by
laying before the young of the previous clutch have left the nest.
On these occasions the young have frequently been badly plucked
about the head and face ; presumably the parents have resented their
presence in the nest after having laid again.
It is well known that the cock Cockatiel shares the duties of incuba-
tion, sitting from early morning to late afternoon while the hen carries
on for the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Both sexes feed the
young but I cannot recall ever having seen a cock feed his mate.
It has always been my opinion that the Cockatiel is more closely
related to the Cockatoos than to the true Parrots, partly on account
of both sexes brooding and partly because of the sexual differences in
plumage which are, to my mind, analogous to those which occur in
the Black Cockatoos, especially in the two red-tailed species.
The Avicultural Society of South Australia deemed the Cockatiel
ineligible for its medal, as it was known to have been bred on numerous
occasions prior to the Society's foundation in 1928. It is strange that
a bird which has bred so freely in captivity and become domesticated
in several countries has not produced any mutations ; I have been
informed that a fawn or cinnamon sport has been bred in a country
town in this state, but I have not been able to verify this statement.
A cock Cockatiel when first introduced to a hen, especially if he
has led a bachelor existence for some time, usually indulges in a
rather comical display consisting of a series of rather absurd looking
hops while following the hen along the ground, and accompanied by
a low warbling variant of the usual shrill call note. Apart from this .
preliminary courtship, I have never seen a cock display to his mate,
and although devoted to each other and indulging frequently in

mutual preening, they are quite easily consoled after the loss of a
mate and readily pair up when a newcomer is introduced.
(2) Red-sided Parrot (Lorius pectoralis )
Synonyms. --Red-sided Eclectus, Rocky Parrot (by the residents of
Cape York).
Distribution. --Confined as far as Australia is concerned to a portion
of Cape York Peninsula, North Queensland, but also found in New
Guinea and some of the adjacent islands.
Description. --The adult male is a large short-tailed Parrot, of a
predominantly bright green colour, relieved by a patch of red on the
sides of the body which extends under the wing. The upper mandible
is red with a yellow tip and the lower is black.
The adult female is strikingly different, being mainly of a reddish
crimson colour, except for a purplish blue abdomen and a blue band
across the upper back. The mandibles in this sex are black.
The immature birds of each sex closely resemble the adults, being
only slightly duller in coloration.
Variations. --It is extremely doubtful if the Australian bird can be
separated from the one found in New Guinea.
Coloured Plates. --The plate in Greene (vol. iii, p. 89) is a fairly
good representation of the two sexes. That by Roland Green in
Mathews (vol. vi, p. 248) is not very good, inasmuch as both birds
are shown in rather unnatural postures and the male is drawn in a
position which does not exhibit the conspicuous red flanks, whilst the
blue of the female is much too violet in shade. Gronvold's plate in
The Emu (vol. xiv, plate F) is a reasonably good representation of
a male.
Field Notes. --I have not seen this bird, but observed the closely allied
Grand Eclectus (L. roratus) on Morotai ; they are usually seen singly,
and had a slow flapping flight and uttered their harsh call note at
intervals while flying.
Aviary Notes. --Although I kept a hen Grand Eclectus for several
weeks on Morotai, I have no personal experience of the species under
review as, although I once owned a pair, I exchanged them before
actually taking delivery of them.
These birds have been represented in the Adelaide Zoo collection
almost continuously since 1908, and although many eggs have been
laid and several young have hatched complete success has never been
achieved. In Taronga Park Zoo, Sydney, several pairs of these birds
have been kept together in the one aviary for many years and a
considerable number of young have been reared, but I think I am
correct in saying that, apart from a few of the first breedings, the
young have been removed from the nests and hand-reared after

reaching a certain stage of development. For further details the
reader is referred to the articles by Patten in Avicultural Magazine,
1939, P- 288, and 1944, p. 123. It would appear that the hen bird
alone incubates and that the cock feeds the hen but has not been
observed to feed the young ; this latter point, however, requires
corroboration.
I have no record of birds obtained in Australia being kept in captivity
other than on Gape York ; all the published observations deal with
birds obtained from New Guinea or their aviary-bred descendants.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.972175393939394" page_id="56311757"  page_num="47" year="" vol="">
Distribution. --As far as Australia is concerned, this bird is only
known from Cape York Peninsula, but an apparently identical bird
is found in New Guinea and some of the near-by islands.
Description. --A medium-sized short-tailed, mainly green Parrot in
which the male has the face, forehead, and throat pinkish-red and the
crown and back of the head a bluish-violet. The beak in this sex is
red, with a yellowish tip. The female differs from the male in that
she has the whole of the head and face of a brownish-grey colour and
the beak is black. The immatures are said to resemble the female and
judging by the analogy of a closely allied species the young males
should show a pinkish tinge on the head.
Variations. --Like the foregoing species, it is probable that this bird
cannot be separated from the New Guinea form.
Coloured Plates .--These are few in number. That of a pair by
Roland Green, in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 253), is quite good, and the
plate by Gronvold, which appeared in The Emu (vol. xiv, plate F),
when the bird was first discovered in Australia, is reasonably good of
a male. There is also a plate of the male of the closely allied, if not
identical, bird from the Aru Islands, in the Avicultural Magazine,
1931, p. 181.
Field Notes. --I have not had an opportunity of seeing this species,
but the closely allied species (G. cyanicollis ) was common on Morotai
and I have recorded my observations on its habits in the Avicultural
Magazine, 1946, p. 209.
Aviary Notes. --I have never seen this bird in captivity. Gayley
records that a few specimens, obtained from New Guinea, were kept
in Taronga Park Zoo for a short time and I remember that the
Adelaide Zoo had correspondence just prior to the 1939-1945 war
with a person in Central Queensland who claimed to have a pair.
The few records of members of this genus in captivity in England
stress the extreme delicacy of the birds, possibly on account of
unsuitable feeding ; my impression is that the genus is probably a
fruit-eating one.

Before passing on to the next genus, reference should be made to
a large black and red Parrot which has been seen on Cape York on
several occasions but has never been collected. The writer is of the
opinion that this will eventually be proved to be the strange Pesquet's
Parrot ( Psittrichas fulgidus , olim Dasyptilus pesqueti), of New Guinea,
figured in Avicultural Magazine, 1936, p. 175, which has been
imported into England and several of which have been exhibited in
Taronga Park Zoo in recent years.
(4) Barraband Parrakeet (Polytelis swainsonii)
Synonyms. --Superb Parrot (R.A.O.U. Checklist, 1926). Green Leek
(name commonly used in districts where it occurs).
Distribution. --Occurs only in parts of Victoria and New South Wales
and appears to be practically confined to the vicinity of the upper
Murray River and its tributaries.
Description. --The adult male is a slim, long-tailed Parrot of a
predominantly bright green colour, the forehead and throat are orange-
yellow and there is a crescent of scarlet below the yellow on the throat.
The female is a much duller green and lacks the yellow and red
adornments ; she has, however, a few red feathers on the legs, and the
inner webs of the tail-feathers, apart from the central pair, are pink.
The immatures resemble the female, but the green of the young
males is of a slightly brighter shade, especially on the head, and there
is often a suspicion of rose where the red crescent will ultimately
develop, and a few young males show a distinct yellowish wash on the
forehead and throat. It is not always possible to sex individual
juveniles, but some of each sex can usually be picked out with
certainty from a clutch. Adult male plumage is attained by a slow
moult which usually begins when the young birds are between six and
nine months old and is not completed in most cases until the birds
are from twelve to fifteen months old.
Variations. --There do not appear to be any valid subspecies.
Coloured Plates. --Boosey's illustration of a male in Tavistock (p. 98)
is the best that I am aware of; Roland Green's, in Mathews (vol. vi,
p. 261), is quite good of the female but not as good of the male ;
Gronvold's in Seth-Smith (p. 122) is poor, whilst the plate in Greene
(vol. i, p. 67) portrays the male plumage accurately but does not
adequately convey the bird's slim lines.
Field Notes. --My only personal acquaintance with this species
consists of seeing a pair in flight while motoring from Melbourne to
Sydney in November, 1933. Mr. F. Lewitzka, of Enfield, S.A., informs
me that while in camp at Wagga, New South Wales, he observed these
birds on many occasions and noticed them feeding on straw which
had been used for thatching huts.

Aviary Notes .--This species is a most desirable aviary bird, being
hardy, long-lived, and peaceful in a mixed collection. Newly trapped
birds are extremely timid and very unsteady, and take a considerable
time to quieten down ; in any case, this species seldom becomes as
tame and confiding as do most examples of the other two members
of its genus. Barrabands particularly resent being handled and keep
up a continuous squawking when so treated or even when placed in
a confined space, such as a travelling cage.
My early experiences in breeding this species were with a pair
consisting of a cock in adult plumage and of uncertain age obtained
in 1937 from the late Mr. Wachsmann, of Sydney, and a hen bred by
Mr. Waddel, of Melbourne, in 1937 and obtained from him in 1939.
This pair had been kept segregated since the hen was acquired but
it was not until 1945 that any attempt at breeding occurred. In
October of that year a clutch of five eggs was laid ; young were
first heard on 10th November and five could be counted on the 19th.
The first two left the nest rather prematurely on 13th December, the
temperature on that day being well over the century. On the following
day, which was equally hot, a third youngster was out of the nest on
the ground and the remaining two, although almost fully feathered,
were dead in the log. The third young bird died the following day
but the two eldest survived and appeared from the first to be a true
pair. Mr. Koenig, of Ararat, Victoria, obtained these birds from me
and subsequently informed me that the cock was coming into colour
by the end of October, 1946, and was fully coloured by the end of
March, 1947.
In 1946 the old pair again laid five eggs in October ; on this
occasion all were hatched and duly reared and proved to be one cock
and four hens as was thought to be the case soon after they first left
the nest ; the cock bird in this case was not as obvious as the bird
of the previous year, but he was nearly in full colour when I parted
with him when he was nine months old.
In 1947 the hen started her clutch in October with a soft-shelled egg,
but thereafter incubated steadily, and it was not until the middle of
November that I had an opportunity of inspecting the nest and found
that it contained one addled egg and another containing a fully
developed dead embryo. The old hen died suddenly in February, 1948,
and the cock, who had not moulted satisfactorily, only survived her
by a few months.
This season (1948) I mated one of the hens bred in 1946 to an
unrelated cock, and at the time of writing (end of November) they
have three large young in the nest.
This species, judging by its disposition, would almost certainly breed
if several pairs were kept together in a sufficiently roomy aviary ; in
fact, I think I have read of success being achieved under such

conditions. I have no record of this bird ever being other than single
brooded. The male usually feeds the hen when she leaves the log for
the first week or two after the young hatch, but thereafter he usually
helps the hen by feeding the young directly. The display and the
hen's gestures when she wishes to be fed by her mate are quite comical
and are well described in Tavistock (pp. 254-5).
Breeding records in South Australia are not very common. The
A.S.S.A. medal was awarded in 1939 to Mr. Banyer, of Blackwood,
and the species has bred in the Adelaide Zoo on a couple of occasions.
Barrabands are extremely susceptible to ophthalmia (eye disease),
and, although cures are claimed, in most cases that I have observed
the disease has seemed to reach a chronic state with some persistent
swelling of the lids. Paralysis of the legs occurs occasionally and, if
not fatal, leaves the victim hopelessly crippled.
(5) Rock Pebbler Parrakeet (. Polytelis anthopeplus)
Synonyms. --Regent Parrot (R.A.O.U. Checklist, 1926), Smoker
Parrot--the name most commonly used both in Victoria and
Western Australia, Black-tailed Parrakeet--the earliest name.
Distribution. --Confined to the region of the lower Murray River and
the adjoining mallee country of New South Wales, Victoria, and
South Australia ; also found over a wide area in South-Western
Australia.
Description. --A rather large, plump, long-tailed Parrot. In the adult
male the predominant colour is a rich mustard-yellow ; the mantle is
an olive-green and there are some dark carmine markings on the
inner wing-coverts, while the tail is a very dark blue-black. The female
is similarly patterned, but the yellow is replaced by an olive-green and
the tail is green with the inner webs of all but the central feathers a
pale rose-pink. The young resemble the female on leaving the nest,
but the young males in a clutch can usually be identified by the
slightly yellower tinge in the green coloration particularly on the
head. They begin a slow moult at about the age of six months, when
the bright yellow feathers begin to appear on the head and breast,
full adult male plumage being usually reached when the bird is about
fourteen or fifteen months old.
Variations .*--The Western Australian birds form a good subspecies
(westralis), the males being greener and never attaining the bright
yellow shade of the Eastern form while the females are brighter
and less of an olive-green shade.
Colour Plates. --The plate of a male in Greene (vol. iii, p. 65) is
very good except that the tail is a little too short. The plate in
Mathews (vol. vi, p. 266), by Roland Green, is only fair ; the male

figured, although an eastern bird, is not bright enough, and the
colouring of the tail gives an erroneous impression ; the female is
quite good, although looking rather more like the eastern form than
the western which it is supposed to be.
Field Notes .---My only acquaintance with this bird in the field is
a recent one in that I noticed three birds, apparently one male and
two females, from the window of a train near Southern Gross, Western
Australia. In flight they certainly give the impression of being
predominantly yellow birds.
Aviary Notes .--A quiet, attractive aviary bird, soon becoming
relatively fearless and always very inoffensive in a mixed collection.
Young birds taken from the nest and hand-reared make pleasing pets
and excellent whistlers.
My early breeding successes with this species were with a pair, which
consisted of a cock which was in adult plumage when I obtained him
in 1938 from a local birdshop and a hen obtained for me during 1940.
It was not until 1944 that any success was obtained, although some
interest in a log had been evinced in the previous year. In 1944 the
first egg of a clutch of four was laid on 25th September, and three
young were seen on 22nd October, the fourth egg having disappeared.
One of the young birds died when a week old, but the remaining two
survived and both left the nest on 27th November, one being a little
more mature than the other. These proved to be two cocks, as was
thought likely when they were first fledged, and had attained full adult
plumage at the age of fourteen months. In 1945 the same pair of
birds had a clutch of five eggs in late September, and hatched them
all, but only reared three, two dying when quite large and the survivors
leaving the nest in late November ; these were correctly diagnosed as
two cocks and a hen. In 1946 the clutch of five was commenced in
mid-September; four were hatched, but the youngest left the nest
prematurely and, although replaced repeatedly, it was ultimately
found dead on the ground ; the remaining three were successfully
reared and proved to be all hens, although not accurately diagnosed
on this occasion. In 1947 five young were hatched, one died early,
and the remaining four were successfully reared.
The old pair's career was terminated by the hen's death in the
winter of 1948 after an unsatisfactory moult. A new hen was obtained
shortly afterwards, and at the time of writing (late November) a fine
brood of six young have just left the nest.

no definite record of two clutches having been laid in the one season.
The male assists with the feeding of the young as soon as the female
ceases to brood them more or less continuously, usually about the
tenth to twelfth day; prior to this he usually feeds his mate when-
ever she leaves the nest.
The display is somewhat like that of the Barraband, but not usually
so elaborate ; the hen, about the time of laying, frequently importunes
her mate to feed her in the same way as a Barraband hen does.
Rock Pebblers are prone to eye disease, but it is by no means as
frequently seen in them as in the case of Barrabands.

Description. --A slim Parrot with a very long tail, clothed in pastel
shades. In the adult male the crown of the head is light blue, the
mantle is olive, the wing-coverts yellowish-green, and the rump violet.
The throat is pink, the breast and abdomen greyish-green with some
pink on the thighs and the under tail-coverts are olive-green. The
central tail-feathers are very long and olive in colour, all the others
have the inner webs rose-pink. The third primaries have the peculiar
spatulate elongation, which is often abraded and lost some time prior
to the moult ; I have no definite record regarding the age at which
this feature is first acquired.
The adult female never has the spatule, and her tail is never as long
as is that of the male. In addition, the rump is always rather slaty in
colour, the blue on the head is replaced by a greyish-mauve, and the
wing-coverts are greener. The beak, which is a coral-red in the male,
is darker in the female. Immatures tend to resemble the female, but
the pink on the throat and thighs is considerably brighter and more
of a puce shade ; they are not very easy to sex, but the young males
have larger, flatter heads and tend to be a little brighter on the crown.
Adult plumage is acquired rather slowly and more or less imperceptibly
between the age of twelve and fifteen months.
Variations. --No valid subspecies are described, but it would appear
that not all males acquire the vivid violet colour on the rump.
Coloured Plates. --These seldom do justice to the bird's exquisite
colouring. Roland Green's plate in Avicultural Magazine, 1935,

the spatules on the wings.
Field Notes .---Very few ornithologists have seen this bird in the field
and I have not been one of the fortunate few. It would appear to be
a naturally fearless bird from all accounts. Mention has frequently
been made of its alleged habit of resting along a thick branch instead
of perching in the ordinary manner ; this peculiarity is certainly not
noticeable in captivity.
Aviary Notes .--This species has always been extremely popular and
much sought after as an aviary bird, and in the last twenty years has
been bred so freely in Australia generally, and in South Australia in
particular, that it can now be regarded as domesticated. Its delicate
colouring, elegant shape, and tameness have always had a wide appeal
for bird-lovers, but individuals and pairs have been singularly variable
in their behaviour and readiness to breed in captivity.
My personal experiences with this species have been very dis-
appointing, as the following account will show. My first pair were
obtained late in 1935 and were extremely tame ; the hen laid three
eggs late in October of the following year and then proceeded to
produce, with increasing difficulty, a series of soft-shelled eggs, which
eventually proved fatal to her. A new hen, obtained late in November,
1936, laid two eggs early in the following month but broke them both ;
two more eggs followed and were incubated, but although one of these
was fertile, it failed to hatch. During the next three seasons no eggs
were laid although the hen came into breeding condition in September
of both 1938 and 1939. The cock was changed prior to the 1940
season but without any improvement in results. In 1941, however,
five good young birds were reared, and it was hoped that the tide had
turned at last. Success was short-lived, however, for although eggs
were laid in 1942 they were ejected from the log, and in 1943 no eggs
appeared at all. In 1944 a clutch of five was commenced late in
September, but only two eggs proved fertile ; of these, only one
hatched and the youngster survived a few days only, probably because
the hen stopped brooding it at night far too soon. For the 1945 season
a new cock bird was tried, the immediate result being a series of
soft-shelled eggs. Later in the season another soft-shelled egg was
followed by a good one, which was incubated but proved infertile.
August, 1946, saw the introduction of a new hen, an aviary-bred bird
nearly two years old. She came into breeding condition almost at
once and laid a clutch of five early in September, one of them on the
ground. Only two of the remaining four were fertile and one of these
hatched early in October, the other failing to emerge from the shell.
This solitary youngster was reared successfully. High hopes were
entertained in 1947 when the hen started laying in mid-September,
but she became egg-bound with her fifth egg and, although she

continued to sit after eventually laying this egg, the other eggs were
spoiled and none of them hatched. I thought she was going to lay
again late in October, but nothing eventuated. The present season
(1948) started poorly, the first egg, laid in mid-September, being
soft-shelled ; however, four good eggs followed, but only two of these
were fertile and only one hatched and was eventually reared. Before
this bird left the nest the hen had started to lay again ; this time four
out of the clutch of six were fertile and duly hatched, and at the time
of writing (mid-December) four young birds are progressing satis-
factorily. From the foregoing it will be seen that my experiences with
this species have been anything but smooth, and although many
aviculturists have reliable breeding pairs, such as the famous one at
the Adelaide Zoo (vide Avicultural Magazine, 1947, p. 58),
many others can recount experiences similar to mine and also com-
plicated by egg-eating hens and non-feeding cocks.
The eggs of the Queen Alexandra are unique amongst those of
Australian Parrots by virtue of their highly glossed appearance.
The A.S.S.A. medal for breeding this species was awarded in 1928
to F. P. Kell ; there are, however, several earlier records of which
the first appears to be that of Zietz, in 1899.
More often than not the species appears to be single-brooded
although there are plenty of hens that invariably have two nests in
a season. Individual cocks vary enormously in their habits, some being
assiduous feeders, both of their mates and young, whilst others are of
no help whatever and are sometimes even a hindrance to the hen in
her task.
The display is somewhat like that of the Barraband, but is even
more ludicrous to human eyes ; cocks, when displaying, are able to
erect a few feathers in the frontal region in the form of a tiny crest.
Fortunately this species does not seem to be nearly as susceptible
to eye disease as are its near relatives.
Community breeding has been successfully practised on a number
of occasions but plenty of nesting sites and a spacious aviary are
necessary to avoid undue interference ; generally speaking, segregated
pairs are more satisfactory.

Description .--A heavily built large Parrot, with a long wedge-shaped
tail. The adult male has the head and underparts scarlet, the back
and wings are dark green, relieved by a light green stripe or " butter-
fly 55 on the wings, the rump is dark blue, as also is a narrow band
across the back of the neck, and the tail is black. The upper mandible
is orange-red with a blackish tip.
The adult female differs in having the head, breast, and tail green,
the rump is a duller, rather greenish blue, and there is only occasionally
a faint " butterfly " stripe on the wings ; the upper mandible is black.
Immature birds resemble the female on leaving the nest. I have
never found them easy to sex, but Tavistock (Avicultural Magazine,
1932, p. 295) states that " they can be sexed quite easily within a few
weeks of leaving the nest, as the bills of the females quickly darken
while those of the males are of a yellowish colour ; young hens also
are more slender than their brothers, with smaller heads, and they
have much less red on the abdomen and lower breast ". Adult male
plumage is obtained by a slow moult which starts when the bird is
something over fifteen months old and is not completed until the bird
is between 2J and 2 \ years old.
Variations .--The birds from the northern extremity of the range have
been given subspecific rank [minor) ; they are said to be smaller
with the red colouring of a darker shade ; whether this is a constant
feature I am unable to say.
Coloured Plates .--Not many good plates exist. Roland Green's, of a
pair, in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 291), is very good. The plate of a male
in Greene (vol. i, p. 93) is poor in that there is too much blue on the
mantle and tail and the pale green wing-band is not shown.
Field Notes .--I have seen this bird on several occasions in the
Dandenong ranges, near Melbourne. Wild birds can usually be seen
in the Sir Colin Mackenzie Sanctuary, near Healesville, Victoria ;
they are fairly tame and are attracted by the food provided for the
inmates of the Sanctuary.
Aviary Notes .--This species is reasonably hardy and long-lived in
captivity but, although gaudily coloured, it is a rather sluggish and
somewhat uninteresting inhabitant of an aviary. It is rather a heavy,
clumsy flier and needs a large enclosure to be seen at its best. It has,
however, the advantage of being relatively peaceful and unaggressive
in a mixed collection.
Kings are one of the species that I have not yet succeeded in
breeding ; a hen that I had from 1936 to 1947 with two different mates
used to raise my hopes by coming into breeding condition in November.
In 1946 I felt certain she was going to lay as she spent a lot of
time in a large log, but nothing eventuated. A new hen was obtained
in 1947, and although she gave no indication of breeding that year
she came into breeding condition early in November the following year

and proceeded to lay four eggs either from the perch or on the ground,
being quite disinterested in the two large logs provided. Only one of
these eggs was unbroken and it was placed under a pair of Adelaide
Rosellas but it proved infertile.
Kings are notoriously difficult to satisfy as regards nesting accom-
modation, they appear to favour a very long log, the bottom of which
is resting on the ground. On a good many occasions they have been
known to lay in a seed tray or a box on the ground, or even in a
hollow that they have scratched out on the ground and success has
been achieved under these apparently unfavourable conditions.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded in 1940 to Mrs. Isaacson
for breeding this species for the first time in South Australia. Her
birds were housed in a relatively small, entirely covered, shed-like
aviary and had been there about three years before nesting. They
chose a log about 5 feet from the ground, laid late in November, and
hatched and successfully reared two young birds which left the nest
towards the end of January.
Apart from the foregoing, I am only aware of the three following
successes in South Australia. A single bird was bred in the Adelaide
Zoo in 1940, and in 1946 Mr. I. Banyer, of Blackwood, reared two
young birds, the father of which was still in immature plumage without
any sign of the red head whatsoever. I am not aware of any other
recorded breeding of this species with an uncoloured male, though
presumably it occurs in the wild state. The male bird referred to
came into full colour in a much more rapid moult than usual shortly
after the young were fledged, and the same pair have bred again since
then. Mr. H. Bradley, of Plympton, appears to have been the most
successful local breeder. Having kept a pair of these birds for many
years, they proceeded to come good with a vengeance and reared four
young in 1946 and five in each of the two succeeding years.
The display of this species is described at length in Tavistock
(p. 244). Shortly before the onset of the moult, the scarlet coloration
fades appreciably to an almost brick-red. Other than at the time of
the moult, birds showing this colour are invariably old or in poor
health.

the Timor species. In Australia the bird favours mainly open timbered
country.
Description .--A moderately large Parrot with a rather short, wedge-
shaped tail. The adult male has the head and underparts a vivid light
green, the mantle is a peculiar purplish-black colour, the rump is
a vivid blue, and there is a broad crimson band on the border of the
wing.
The adult female is often a slightly larger bird and is a duller green,
without the dark mantle and with a lighter blue rump ; there is
a band of red on the margin of the wing which varies considerably in
width but is always much narrower than in the male.
Immatures closely resemble the female and are extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to sex with any certainty. The width and extent of
the red wing-bar is quite unreliable as evidenced by the experience
of a well-known local Parrot fancier who attempted not long ago to
sex a brood of four young Crimson-wings ; he put rings on the birds
he believed to be young cocks, judging by the extent of the red bar,
and time proved him to be exactly 100 per cent wrong ! A recent
close inspection of another brood of four young birds made me think
that the intensity of the blue on the rump might be a guide to sex,
but I have not had the opportunity of following up this hunch. Adult
plumage is not attained by the cocks until they are over two years old ;
frequently, however, their sex is revealed by the appearance of a few
dark feathers on the mantle or extra red ones on the wing when they
are between fifteen and. eighteen months of age. This, however, is not
invariably the case, and many aviculturists have kept a bird for many
months believing it to be a hen only to be ultimately disillusioned by
the eventual appearance of one of these tell-tale feathers.
Variations .--Northern birds are said to be smaller with a deeper
shade of crimson on the wings, but I have grave doubts as to the
constancy of this difference and as to whether it warrants the establish-
ment of a subspecies.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate, in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 279),
is an excellent portrayal of the two sexes. Greene's plate (vol. i, p. 71)
is quite good of an adult cock.
Field Notes .--During a few hours spent in Darwin late in 1945 I was
delighted to see a single bird of this species. Its flight is buoyant and
erratic and quite unlike the heavy, rather laboured flight of the King ;
in fact, I consider that they are erroneously placed in the same genus.
Aviary Notes .--Once established, this species is relatively long-lived
in captivity, but newly trapped birds are always delicate and doubtful
propositions and even aviary-bred birds are apt to be upset by a move.
Cocks are often very spiteful, not only towards their mates but also
towards other nearly related species, although they will seldom cross
swords with a Broadtail. Individuals vary very considerably in their

behaviour towards their own mates, but most cocks indulge in a certain
amount of wife-beating, especially in the breeding season ; apart from
the loss of a few feathers little harm seems to result in most cases.
This species makes a most attractive aviary bird on account of its
brilliant colouring, and being active birds they consequently make a
good display in a mixed collection.
Crimson-wings are another species that I have been relatively
unsuccessful with both as regards longevity and breeding. However,
a pair, of which the cock was obtained in 1937 and the hen the following
year, were more satisfactory in both respects than most of my earlier
acquisitions. They first nested in 1941, laying in a log which was
standing vertically on the ground and rearing two young, which proved
eventually to be hens. The following year they laid a number of eggs,
none of which were hatched, and in 1943 the hen died egg-bound
and her mate did not survive much longer. Another pair, which
I brought home from Queensland early in 1944, lived until quite
recently, but although considerable interest was usually evinced early
in the spring of each year no eggs were ever laid.
Crimson-wings frequently come into breeding condition early and
also start to moult correspondingly early, and I often wonder if these
birds are derived from the Northern Territory and are following the
usual habits of Northern Rosellas and Hooded Parrakeets in this
respect.
The A.S.S.A. medal for breeding this species was awarded to the
late E. Baxter Cox in 1935 ; the records of this breeding have
unfortunately been lost. A good many subsequent successes with the
species have been recorded but I know of none in which the cock has
been an uncoloured bird.
Like Kings, Crimson-wings are sometimes difficult to satisfy as
regards a nesting site, and in many cases they seem to prefer a deep
log extending to ground level.
Reports suggest that this species is, in part at any rate, a nectar-
feeder, and I have often wondered whether this fact accounts for the
delicacy of newly trapped birds.
The display of the Crimson-wing is fully and excellently described
in Tavistock, on pp. 250-1.

<bodyText confidence="0.998614684210526" page_id="56311769"  page_num="59" year="" vol="">
The sequence of plumages in the Long-tailed Duck ( Clangula
hyemalis) is very complicated and has long aroused the interest of
ornithologists. For many years Scandinavian students have maintained
the existence of three annual moults, a view which has not until
recently been generally accepted. A few years ago I published a study
on this subject (Journ. f Ornith ., vol. 89, 1941, pp. 282-337) based on
the unique material of about 650 skins in the Zoological Museum of
Copenhagen. I came to the conclusion that the moulting phenomena in
this peculiar bird was still more complicated than hitherto suspected,
and that it was most convenient to divide the annual sequence of
plumages into four, viz. the well-known 44 ornamental or winter-dress ",
the 44 nuptial or summer-dress ", the " eclipse-dress ", and the new
44 autumn-dress ". However, it was expressly emphasized that no
feather-germ produced more than three annual generations of feathers.
My results gave rise to the following remarks from Messrs. Delacour
and Mayr in their modern treatise of the Duck tribe ( Wilson Bull.,
vol. 58, 1946, p. 107) : 44 These are rather startling conclusions, but
we lack the material to discuss them critically." In spite of a still
more pronounced deficiency of material, Mrs. Vesta Stresemann has
not put the same restraint on herself as the said authors, but has
recently published a paper of some length in the December issue of
Avicultural Magazine (" Eclipse-Plumage and Nuptial Plumage in
the Old Squaw or Long-tailed Duck," vol. 54, no. 6, 1948, pp. 188-
194), the main theme being a criticism of my results. As I do not
agree with the conclusions in the paper by Mrs. Stresemann, I think
it advisable to add some comments and to answer some of the questions
asked for by the authoress, especially as my paper, written in a German
Journal, is probably not easily accessible to English readers.
Mrs. Stresemann reproaches me (p. 189) that I have included the
moult of the wing in the eclipse-moult. 4 4 It appears absurd that the
bird would wear an eclipse wing in its highly evolved specific plumage."
I did not lay any stress on this point, but have only followed the
common usage in conformity with Witherby, Schioler, etc., who all
have used the same procedure. The wing-moult continues the eclipse-
moult in the Ducks and is therefore united with this as one 44 moult "
by most authors, but Mrs. Stresemann is no doubt right in her
assumption that the hormonal balance necessary for producing
ornamental feathers is reached just before the wing moult, with the

<bodyText confidence="0.999297733333333" page_id="56311770"  page_num="60" year="" vol="">
consequence that the new wing must be looked upon as a part of
the ornamental--not of the eclipse--plumage. Mrs. Stresemann
maintains the view that feathers produced under different physiological
conditions cannot be regarded as belonging to one and the same dress,
and on the basis of this viewpoint the wing moult naturally cannot be
united with the eclipse moult. However, such a clear-cut distinction
is too theoretical and would make it impossible to admit the existence
of all compound plumages. No students would, e.g. deny the develop-
ment of a certain " summer-dress " in the Guillemot ( Uria aalge ),
although only the head moults in spring and more than four-fifths of
the feathers of the summer dress are retained from the winter dress.
In many species which moult during a long period the appropriate
threshold of certain hormones influencing the feather pattern is
reached in the course of the moult (e.g. in the Ptarmigan), and this
circumstance accounts for the variegated aspect of the final plumage.
In such cases it would be irrelevant to claim that the feathers belonging
to this very dress should be produced under the same physiological
conditions. So I should rather leave this complicated question open,
and in the meantime use the division adopted by Witherby, etc.,
concerning the wing moult in the Ducks.
Mrs. Stresemann further is of the opinion that the nuptial or
summer plumage, for which she adopts Millais' term cc semi-eclipse ",
is not a special dress, but only the half-finished eclipse-plumage.
Nevertheless, she is aware that the scapulars are moulted twice, both
during the summer-moult as well as during the eclipse-moult. I have
maintained the two plumages in question only on the basis of this
double moult of the scapulars, and no one has ever postulated any
double moult of other areas of the plumage. However, it appears to
me that this is sufficient to admit the existence of two plumages.
How else is it possible to describe a plumage with two different sets
of feathers of a certain, definite region ? Gould it be called " eclipse
plumage ' A ' and 'B' " ? This would be especially absurd in this
species, in which the scapulars form such a dominant part of the
plumage, and the two generations of scapulars are so strikingly
different that they no doubt have different biological tasks. To unite
the summer plumage and the eclipse plumage in the Long-tailed Duck
would be to deny facts.
The explanation of the biological value of the summer-plumage by
the authoress is exactly the same as I have given in my paper, pp. 331-2,
so I certainly agree. Mrs. Stresemann only does not concur with my
opinion that this dress should have a significance in courtship. I have,
however, emphasized that the epigamic value of this plumage is
subordinate to the cryptic one and said literally : " The development
of small epigamic characters is very well compatible with the primary
cryptic value of the summer plumage " (p. 332). When bearing in

mind that the establishment of the plumage is entirely pre-nuptial,
that the courtship-display with its various antics takes place in this
plumage, and that the scapulars and the ocular patch are very
conspicuous and contrasting in their coloration, it is obvious that the
summer dress must have an epigamic function too.
The main point in the argument of Mrs. Stresemann is the rejection
of the autumn plumage. Without having examined a single specimen
in this dress my critical investigation of a large series of material is
entirely condemned. Birds in this dress may--according to Mrs.
Stresemann--either be young birds or birds in second winter. " How
can we know they are not young birds ? " she asks. Having handled
hundreds of these birds it is easy for me to answer this question. The
difference between the autumn-plumage and the juvenile and first-
winter dresses are clear-cut ; there is a large gap between them which
is not bridged by any specimen, i.e. there are no intermediates. Besides,
some males in autumn-plumage have kept remnants of the eclipse-
plumage, as described pp. 309-3n in my paper. So they could not
be young birds ! It is as easy to explain why the autumn-plumage
cannot be the second-winter dress. If it were so it would be worn
the whole winter, but it is only found during the autumn ; not a
single individual clad in the autumn-plumage has been found later
than November (almost a hundred ad. from December to March
examined). Moreover, all adult males from the period 25th September
to 25th November (a total of 13 specimens examined) wear the
autumn plumage, some still with remnants of the eclipse plumage,
others showing various stages of the moult into the winter plumage ;
even in the first half of December many birds have not yet quite
finished the winter moult. This appears from the diagram on p. 317
in my paper. Not in a single case was a direct moult from eclipse- to
winter-plumage observed. What can we deduce from all this ? When
all adult males examined have a definite plumage in the autumn--
and only in the autumn--the conclusion must be that all adult males
actually exchange the eclipse-plumage with the autumn-plumage and
from this moult into the ornamental or winter-plumage ; no other
explanation is possible.
In 1944 I examined the entire material of Long-tailed Duck in
various Swedish museums, a total of about 100 specimens. In all
details they a*greed with my previous material. I found three adult
males collected in the autumn months, viz. from Sigtuna, 17th
October, 1926 (in Zool. Inst, of Uppsala), and two from October in
the private collection of Mr. Tage Adolfsson, Bohus-Bjorko, all three
specimens wearing the autumn plumage.
Mrs. Stresemann expresses her opinion as follows : " We do not
believe in a special autumn plumage for which there seems to be no
biological justification." To reject facts because they at present appear

to be inexplicable has nothing, to do with science. There are other
dresses in Ducks which seem to be completely useless, without any
biological value, e.g. the plumage, more or less suppressed, which
follows the male juvenile plumage in many Ducks, and as a rule is
shed very soon, being replaced by the first ornamental plumage. This
dress was described by Schioler in most surface-feeding Ducks and in
the genus Aythya (also mentioned in the descriptions in Witherby's
Handbook , vol. 3), and I have recently described it also in the genus
JVetta (Dansk Ornith. Foren. Tidsskr., vol. 39, 1945, p. 209). Only in
the Shoveler this plumage is kept for some time as a real " first-winter
plumage ". I believe that this plumage, as well as the autumn-
plumage of the Long-tailed Duck is a remnant of a phylogenetic older
stage which is now receding and which no longer serves any biological
function.
There is no doubt much more to learn about the complicated moult
of the Long-tailed Duck, but what we need are critical and painstaking
studies in the field and in the museum, not mere speculations.

Now and then a letter arrives from some corner of the world asking
me for news of Cleres. Has it been totally wrecked in the war, and
have any of the birds survived the ordeal of invasion ?
I now realize that I never yet have written the whole story for this
magazine where, along the years, news of my collections, big and
small, can be found, whether I kept birds at Villers before 1918 or
later on at Cleres, including the accounts of their destruction.
When I saw Cleres on 7th June, 1940, for the last time until the
autumn of 1946, the grounds had already been bombed heavily twice,
and many animals and birds had been killed ; but for craters and
damaged trees, the park still looked lovely, with hundreds of creatures
all about the place.
The German troops that arrived the next day caused, so I am told,
little trouble ; they even saw that the birds were cared for. But things
soon took a turn for the worse. Birds and animals were killed for fun
or for the pot ; for example, my four precious breeding pairs of
Andean Geese were eaten at Christmas time by soldiers ! Food
became scarce ; Monsieur G. Olivier, who had kindly assumed the
ungrateful charge of preserving Cleres during the absence of
Mr. Fooks, now a refugee in England as I was myself in America,
had to dispose of a large part of the stock. Some birds
were sold to dealers, others deposited at the Paris Zoos and

with Monsieur F. Edmond-Blanc. Valuable species, however,
were kept at Cleres, particularly Waterfowl, and the Gibbons. But
destruction at the hands of the occupants was increasing, and my
friends asked Professors Stresemann and Ghigi to intervene ; this
they did promptly and successfully. During eighteen months Cleres
was neither occupied nor disturbed any more. But the situation
deteriorated in 1943 and Cleres was reoccupied. Civilians, drafted for
the establishment of V1 bombs' launching rails in the vicinity, were
stationed by the hundreds in our grounds. They proved more
destructive than any troops before, breaking the fences and slaughtering
animals and birds. In 1944, the German soldiers were demoralized
and became more obnoxious ; they kept dogs and horses in the park,
and they did much harm. But M. Olivier and Andre Brohart, the
capable and devoted head-gardener, managed to repair the worst
damage and to save a great deal. There were still Deer, Gibbons,
and rare birds. Even Red-breasted Geese, Gape and Sharp-winged
Teal bred during those years. More damage was done by bombs in
1944 and 1945, this time by Allied planes, and two terrible craters,
50 feet across, were made in the higher part of the park by German
Vi bombs crashing soon after they had been launched. My friends
were proud to have saved a nice lot of animals and birds when, on
the very last day of the occupation, practically all were destroyed.
It was a very bad stroke of luck ; S.S. troops, who had been prevented
from crossing the Seine for several days by Allied bombing, managed
to pass the river one foggy morning, and they went straight to Cleres.
Partly hunger and partly spite, they shot with tommy-guns everything
alive they could find, just before they left for good. When Mr. Fooks
was allowed to come to Cleres in 1945, one Muntjac, one Crane,
some Junglefowl, a Swan, and a few Ducks only remained.
Mr. Fooks had reported that, empty and spoiled as it was, Cleres
could be restored. I then decided that he should return, which he was
eager to do, and resume managing the estate as he had done so well in
the past twenty-five years. Despite tremendous difficulties, which further
occupation by Allied troops did not alleviate although they proved
helpful and considerate, most of the park, the gardens, and the
aviaries were soon put into order. When I returned in September,
1946, I was agreeably surprised at the results of Mr. Fooks' work.
The place looked much as before in a general way, and it was already
fairly well stocked, thanks to the generosity of two of my English
friends, Mr. Spedan Lewis, who had presented a fine collection of
Pheasants and Waterfowl, and Major A. Pam, who had given many
Wallabies and Geese. Also Professor A. Urbain, Director of Paris
Museum, had returned birds which he had kept for us during the war,
and loaned many others and some animals. It may be said here that
I have bequeathed Cleres and the adjoining property to the National

Museum in order to ensure its future as far as can be done in these
troubled times. Mr. Fooks came to New York and brought home
a large collection early in 1947.
Cleres was officially reopened on 25th May, 1947, by M.
Andre Marie, Vice-Premier and Minister of Justice, accompanied
by all the authorities of Normandy, the British and American
Consuls, the Director of the National Museum, and the delegates
of numerous scientific institutions and societies ; many of my
friends were there, among them Miss Barclay-Smith, Dr. Hindle,
and Mr. Peter Scott, from England ; Mme J. M. Derscheid,
Colonel and Mme J. Dufour, from Belgium. To me it was a very
moving occasion.
Since that day Cleres has been a public park, where visitors are
admitted every day and may wander as they please, the gate
takings paying for most of the upkeep. It is gratifying to state
that they seem to appreciate it and cause little trouble. In the present
circumstances, such an arrangement is the only way open to maintain
the collections and to keep up the park. The days when such activities
could be privately financed hobbies are, I am afraid, gone for ever.
As I have said previously, the general aspect has remained the same.
The chateau, completely burnt inside, does not show any scars outside.
The gardens are as usual, the rarer plants, which had disappeared, being
gradually replaced. The main aviaries have been done up, as also
a good part of the pheasantries, the rest being damaged beyond
repair. The various pens inside the park have been re-established,
and the general fencing reconditioned. The tropical houses and
indoor bird galleries, however, are a total loss, and it is hardly worth
while reconstructing them as long as fuel and special foods are not
available ; it would also be almost impossible to procure to-day the
rare small birds for which they had been planned.
Across the road the deer park is again well stocked with Pseuxaxis
presented by M. Edmond-Blanc, but the enclosures and pens where
so many Cranes, Rheas, Cassowaries, Ostriches, Geese, etc., used to
live and breed have completely vanished, the fences and houses having
been removed during the war. The rat-proof duckery alone has been
partly repaired, and we hope to restore everything gradually. Given
time and peace, Cleres may one day regain its past splendour.
The collections, of course, are not yet up to the old standard.
But they have made a good start and are progressing year by year.
A number of rare species are again represented. Blackbucks and
Moufflons from Vincennes, Wallabies from Wormley, Chinese Water-
deer from Woburn roam the park with Reeves' Muntjacs which have
been recaptured in the neighbouring woods. A couple of Barbary Apes
live at liberty, but Gibbons have not yet been procurable. There are
Rheas, Emus, Sarus, Demoiselle, and Crowned Cranes, also Wild

Turkeys and Red Junglefowl. The latter are the genuine wild birds
and, owing to being shot at during the war, they have become so
shy that they cannot be approached, flying off at 50 yards. They
appear to be the only pure stock left in Europe.
Flamingoes, Black-necked Swans, many Peafowl, Pheasants, Geese,
and Ducks have been sent recently from the United States, as well as
a good collection of Doves bred in California.
The five kinds of Peafowl are now represented ; there are Blue and
Brown Eared Pheasants, Monals, Temminck's Tragopans, Grey and
Germain's Peacock Pheasants, Siamese Firebacks, Cheers, Sonnerat's
Junglefowl, Edwards, Mikado, Versicolor, Elliot's, and all the
commoner species of Pheasants. I could even obtain a pair of the rare
Imperial Pheasant, which I discovered in Indo-China in 1923 ; there
are still a few of them in American aviaries, all descendants from the
original pair which bred at Cleres for the first time in 1925 ; it is
nice to see them again where their ancestors lived before. There are
four species of Swans and a good collection of Geese, including
Cereopsis, Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Emperor, and Red-breasted,
South African, and Paradise Sheldrakes, Fulvous Tree Ducks and all
the more usual species of Ducks and Teal, and an old Sharp wing
which survived all the trouble. Among the Doves, most of the
Australian species are represented, including the pretty Brush Bronze-
wing, Philippine Cuckoo-Doves, Grayson's, Bleeding-hearts, and
African Blue-headed ( puella ). Budgerigars of many new colours,
Fischer's Lovebirds make a good show in some of the aviaries, while
a pre-war pair of King Parrakeets, which spent several years in a cage
in Paris, have bred the last two seasons. There are also Stanleys,
Crimson-wings, and a few other Parrakeets, two or three Amazons,
and some Macaws. Other aviaries are well stocked with Glossy
Starlings, Weavers, Whydahs, Waxbills, and other seed-eating
birds from Senegal, easy to obtain in France at present. In spite of
great difficulty with labour and food, a number of birds have been
reared the last three years.
It is easy to imagine what an effort it was necessary to make to
rehabilitate Cleres. The credit for it goes almost entirely to Mr. Fooks,
whose skill, courage, and devotion have overcome all obstacles.
Although fate has decided, so it seems, that I shall spend the greatest
part of my later years across the Atlantic, I would not consider the
idea of abandoning Cleres once it was certain that its revival was not a
hopeless proposition. I am still much attached to it, and I cannot forget
that I spent the best years of my life in making it the sort of place that
I had always dreamed to have for a home, surrounded with the best
that nature has to offer within a frame of order and beauty. As a
home, Cleres hardly exists for me to-day ; but the site remains,
picturesque and harmonious. If I never again can completely enjoy

it as I did in the past, since so much I loved is missing, others can
derive pleasure from it. It was, I think, my duty to preserve Geres
to the utmost of my power for the country and for lovers of nature
and art at large. The maintenance of the park and of the historic
buildings also is important for many who, directly or indirectly, derive
their livelihood from it. I am glad to say that my endeavour has
been appreciated. I was touched by the gratitude and understanding
of the people, and by the appreciative and helpful co-operation given
us by the public authorities at Rouen and in Paris, and by friends
abroad.
I spent many happy years at Geres, and it is with a somewhat
nostalgic but real pleasure that I return there for short periods. In
many ways, it is painfully different to-day, but it has kept a great
deal of its former charm, and glorious memories still dwell under its tall
trees, along its transparent waters, and in its ancient stones. And
gorgeous birds still live, call, sing, and nest in the romantic old park.

Three species of large Macaws to which the above title is applicable
have received scientific names. One of these, the smallest, is Ara
tricolor Bechstein, which was confined to Cuba and the Isle of Pines
and is now extinct (Rothschild, 1907). It was at first thought to be
a variety of A. macao, but apart from this supposition it need not
further trouble us here. The confusion I wish to clear up relates to
the two larger surviving species-- A. macao Linn, and A. chloroptera
Gray, both of which may and have been described either as " red-and-
blue " or " red-and-yellow ", yet they are very distinct. The confusion
arose long ago and is probably attributable to the fact that the early
naturalists had to content themselves with dried skins for reference,
though this should not have prevented them from recognizing the
striking differences in colour of plumage. I will discuss the two in
order of their recognition by ornithologists.

First named by Linnaeus in 1758, the species was by him described
(Syst. Nat., p. 96) as Psittacus macrourus ruber , remigibus supra coeruleis ,
subtus rufis , genis nudis rugosis. The last quality--naked cheeks--fixes
the type, for in the other species the cheeks, though largely naked, are
distinctly marked by parallel tracts of small red feathers separated by
intervening bare skin. Linnaeus later adds tectricibus pluribus luteis,

a feature which is constantly linked genetically with the naked cheeks.
These characters therefore conclusively fix the name macao to the
large red Macaw with completely naked cheeks and much yellow on
the central feathers of the dorsal aspect of the wing.
Unfortunately, Linnaeus states that he based his description on a
bird referred to by Marcgrav (1648) under the native (Tupi) name
of araracanga ; but on consulting the latter author (p. 206) I find that
he states that the bird had green on its wing. Linnaeus must have had
other evidence--possibly captive specimens--he had casually observed
and mentally registered the fact that some, at least, of these large red
birds had yellow wings. This is, of course, mere surmise though it is
obvious that confusion had already arisen.
Latham (1781) was aware of two different large red Macaws, one
of which he terms the red-yellow-and-blue Macaw which is clearly
the macao of Linnaeus's description, the other being labelled merely
the " red-and-blue ". Shaw (1812), on the contrary, recognized but
a single red Macaw which he terms A. macao , or scarlet Macaw. His
figure, though uncoloured, depicts the Macaw of Linnaeus's descrip-
tion. Shaw's description is taken verbatim from Edwards (1743).
He realized the existence of plumage variations, but attributed these
to age factors.
Nevertheless, we have Spix, in 1824, describing as a " new " species,
under the name Arara macao , a Macaw coccineo-rubra , genis periophthal-
miisque large nudis, plumuloso-rugosis , and tect. alarum maiores immac.
virides , all of which features are applicable to the bird noted by
Marcgrav and referred to by Latham as red-and-blue Macaw, but
which do not pertain to Linnaeus's macao. Spix, however, recognized
the Linnean macao under the title A. aracanga , noting the tectfices
alarum majores aureo-Jlava and also the fact that supra et subtus miniaceus
(i.e. cinnabar-coloured) and rugae genarum piloso-albae in reference to
the sparse, short, white hair-like plumes on the cheeks, in contrast to
the feathered tracts of the other species. Spix, then, knew the two
birds, but mixed up the names. He had plenty of later imitators !
Wied (1832), for instance, shortly followed with a description of
" die roth Arara mit griinen Fliigeldeckfedern " and rows of red
feathers on its cheeks as P. macao L., but rightly claims the bird to be
the araracanga of Marcgrav. He was obviously misled by his precursor
Spix over the scientific name. He mentions, by the way, that the
Cuban A. tricolor is probably a variety of the araracanga.
In the same year Lear's plates (1832) depict the red-and-yellow
Macaw answering to the description of Linnaeus's macao under the
name Macrocercus aracanga , i.e. with naked cheeks, central wing feathers
yellow with green edges, the central rectices red with blue tips, and
the lateral ones reddish-chocolate with blue tips, the most lateral pair
blue throughout.

Brehm (1842) recognized two red Macaws, but persists in the
transposition of their names. His Macao At a is shown dark red with
green centres on the wing-feathers and with scattered red feathers on
the naked cheeks. He shows a black-tipped upper mandible. His
Araracanga-Papagei , on the other hand, is figured red with much
yellow on the wing-feathers, though this shades to green along their
margins. The face is shown quite naked and the tip of the bill dusky
with a smaller pigmented triangle at its base than in his " macao ".
Clearly this second bird is the red-yellow-and-blue Macaw of Latham
and the Psittacus macao of Linnaeus.
The next important work in this connection is the Ornithologie
bresilienne of Descourtilz who, like Brehm, under the title Ara aracanga
describes the yellow-winged, naked-cheeked Macaw. His figure shows
no black tip to the bill. He does not mention the green-winged
Macaw. Pelzeln (1867), in a similar work, mentions both birds under
correct specific names, using the generic name Sittace. Unfortunately,
he gives the Portuguese title of arara vermelha to the wrong bird,
i.e. to S. chloroptera (Gray).
Reichenow's well-known monograph (1878-1883) more or less
corrects the position and gives adequate descriptive and pictorial
evidence of the two birds. He, too, uses the generic name Sittace
and describes S. macao as " hellrother Ara ", giving also the French :
name as ara rouge , and the English " red-and-blue " Macaw as distinct
from " dunkelrother Ara ", ara aux ailes verts, but spoiling the account ;
by the English " red-and-yellow " Macaw for S. chloroptera. Moreover, |
he uses the name Aracanga for S. macao which is not in accordance
with Marcgrav's first usage.
Salvador's British Museum Catalogue (1891) adds little, but under
the synonymy of A. macao is listed the red-and-blue Macaw of Edwards
and the red-yellow-and-blue of Latham.
The best published account overtopping not only all those listed so
far but also those that have appeared since, is Penard and Penard's
(1908) De Vogeln van Guyana. This applies both to descriptions and
figures. Ara macao is termed Scharlakenroode-Ara with English equivalent
" blue-and-red Macaw " whilst A. choloroptera is labelled Bloedroode Ara,
anglice " green-and-red Macaw ". Four years later, in the List of the
birds of South America, Lord Brabourne and Chubb (1912) revert to
" scarlet macaw " for A. macao, using the term " red-and-blue "
Macaw for a species to which it had never previously been applied,
i.e. Illiger's Macaw (A. maracana ). A. chloroptera is further confused
by calling it "red-and-yellow". Chubb (1916) perpetuated these
mistakes in his later publication, but Cory (1918) partly corrected the
position by relabelling A. chloroptera " red-blue-and-green macaw ",
though retaining " red-and-blue " for A, maracana .
This disquisition on the names applied to A. macao may suitably

be terminated by reference to the present-day standard work of the
Marquess of Tavistock. 1 Here, the larger A. macao is wisely referred
to as " red-and-yellow " whilst for A. chloroptera the rather ambiguous
" red-and-blue " is perpetuated. It is noted that immature specimens
of A. macao have more green on the wing than the adults.
(2) Ara chloroptera G. R. Gray, 1859
Marcgrav must be credited with the first recognition of the green-
winged red Macaw, yet despite Linnaeus's assertion that he based his
macao on Marcgrav's bird, the fact remains that Linnaeus's description
is not applicable thereto. This Macaw received its scientific name
Ara chloropterus [sic] from Gray only in 1859. But it is debatable
whether or not Gray's name should be regarded as nomen nudum.
It appears merely as an item in a list and is not accompanied by a
description--unless the English vernacular title " green-winged
Macaw " be regarded as adequately distinguishing the bird. Probably
it does, and it is pretty clear which bird Gray had in mind ; neverthe-
less, it does not conform to what is ordinarily understood by a
description, though possibly sufficient to satisfy Article 25 of the
International Rules in so far as " green-winged " is an " indication ".
Sclater (1859) at once accepted Gray's name modifying the spelling
to suit better the generic name Ara. The only earlier names are
hrasiliensis used by Brisson in 1760--usually regarded as non-binomial.
The specific name aracanga ought by rights to be available, since it
derives from Marcgrav, but unfortunately, from Gmelin (1788)
onwards, it has been transferred to the Macaw whose proper name
is macao , which name has priority. Since Gray's time all ornithologists
who have recognized the bird have employed his name.
Muddle, however, has been omnipresent with regard to vernacular
names, especially in English. Though German writers have fairly
consistently recognized the present species as dunkelrother Ara in
contrast to the hellrother Ara (for A. macao ) in English the terms red-and-
blue, red-and-yellow, green-and-red, or red-blue-and-green have been
promiscuously employed, whilst some of these have also been used
for the previous species and, one at least, for a totally different bird
from either of those at present under consideration ! ( Vide supra.)
Personal Observations and Recommendations
It is pretty clear that two birds of similar size and generally similar
in appearance have been long confused, yet are quite distinct. These

There is no evidence that the two kinds interbreed in nature, and
they have always been regarded as distinct species, not as geographical
variants of one form. 1 They do, however, interbreed in captivity,
for Mr. G. S. Mottershead informs me that in 1947 three eggs were
laid by a female A. chloroptera that had lived in the same aviary as a
male A. macao. One of these was infertile, but the other two were
hatched, one baby being killed almost at once, but the other lived for six
weeks. The babies were very small, " no bigger than a man's thumb."
What are we to call these Macaws in English ? In the first place,
the name " red-and-blue " ought to be scrapped for obvious reasons.
In fact, all these cumbersome descriptive titles based on different
colours linked by the conjunction " and " are undesirable. For
A. macao the name Scarlet Macaw is to be recommended ; it has been
used before ; it corresponds well with the German hellroiher Ara , the
French Ara rouge , and the Portuguese Ara vermelha. For A. chloroptera
we cannot do better than perpetuate Gray's " Green-winged Macaw ".
1 Peters (Check list) refers to a subspecies A. chloroptera major of chloroptera, presum-
ably larger than the typical form described by Bertoni in 1901 (An. dent. Paraguayos
(i), no. 1, p. 52, to which I have not had access).
A. macao.
Slightly the larger (total
length, 36 inches).
Scarlet.
Yellow tipped with green
(greener in immature
bird).
Scarlet, with purplish blue
tinge at base and tip.
Blue with some reddish-
chocolate at base.
Naked with sparse, whitish
piles.
Whitish horn colour with
large triangular black
area at base of its lower
margin. Tip often black
also.
Yellowish-white " Hoch-

Reichenow.
A. chloroptera.
Slightly the smaller (total
length, 34 inches).
Crimson.
Median wing coverts olive-
green, greater blue ; in-
nermost greater upper
wing coverts and scapu-
lars olive-green, more or
less tinged with blue.
Dark red with blue tip.
Maroon at base, with blue
tip.
Naked tract traversed by
six or seven curved rows
or dark red short feathers
coursing forwards and
curving upwards be-
neath the eye. (This is
a different arrangement
from the tracts of black
feathers seen on the
cheeks of A. ararauna.)
Similar but with smaller
area of black at base.
Straw-yellow."

NOTES ON BIRDS IN KENYA, UGANDA, AND
TANGANYIKA
By Andrew Wilson
Shortly before I left Glasgow for East Africa in January, 1947,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.980740272727273" page_id="56311781"  page_num="71" year="" vol="">
a friend, a retired district commissioner in Uganda, said to me,
" Africa is a country where you will change your mind about many
things." I now know how right he was, for my two visits to " The
Dark Continent", January to March, 1947, and January to April,
1948, demonstrated that much that I thought to be quite simple turned
out to be not so simple as one was led to believe.
For instance, I held the common belief that tropical Finches, the
common kind that were imported in their thousands before the war,
could be caught by the hundreds, that they went about in huge flocks,
and all you had to do was to set your traps, and, Hi Presto! you had
more birds than you had cages to house.

How different we found the real picture. With a few exceptions
which I will mention later, most of the birds we saw were in ones and
twos, and although we covered nearly 6,000 miles by car, we could
never say that birds of any kind were plentiful. So that the old adage
" Birds of a feather flock together 55 did not apply at the time of the
year when we were there.
Lest I be misunderstood, I hasten to say that we did see some wonder-
ful birds in their wild state. The following list will indicate that East
Africa holds some wonderful birds, birds that are a joy to behold, birds
that are like living jewels when in flight, birds that are a feast for the
eyes, birds that would bring joy to many in aviaries in this country,
if ---and it's a great big if ---the stupid regulations and orders that have
now become part of our everyday life did not prevent them from being
imported unless for Zoos and for medical research purposes.
Here is the list. Fire Finches, Senegal Waxbills, Melba Finches,

of Sunbirds.

<bodyText confidence="0.985137944444444" page_id="56311782"  page_num="72" year="" vol="">
As I have already said, we found most of these in ones and twos ;
for instance in most compounds we were almost sure to find a pair
of Sunbirds, usually Malachite [Necterinia famosd ), the probable reason *
for one pair only being on account of the quarrelsome disposition of
these beautiful little birds.
Then, wherever we found wild fig trees growing we always found
Mouse Birds (Colius striatus ), and it was easy to see why they got their
name. They run up and down the branches like mice, using their
tails in the same fashion as Woodpeckers, hanging on to the ripe
fruit, sometimes in upside-down positions like Tits. They are certainly
most interesting birds to watch. It's a pity they don't do well in
aviaries, not because they are difficult to keep, but on account of the
fact that their tails get destroyed on the wire netting and this takes
away their feature of particular attraction.
My wife and I stayed for a period at Shanzu Beach Hotel, 1 o miles
from Mombasa, where a never-ending source of amusement was
the group of Weavers that monopolized two palm trees that grew
on the foreshore, a few yards from the door of our room, or

A. WILSON-BIRDS IN KENYA, UGANDA, AND TANGANYIKA 73
These industrious birds started work at dawn, repairing, adding to,
and building new nests ; nests that are indeed works of art in structure
and in shape. The last job at dusk appeared to be feeding the young ;
when this was finished silence reigned supreme, such a contrast to the
activities and noise of daytime and as sudden as if one switched off an
electric light ; nor does the simile end there for there is little twilight
in Africa.
We were fortunate in finding a group of Crowned Cranes, about
200, in a clearing a few miles from Nairobi. They were feeding on
grass, grasshoppers, and other insects. When not thus engaged they
performed dances that put one in mind of clowns in a circus. When
disturbed they took to the air, got into line of formation as if under the
orders of a sergeant-major, flew around in a circle and landed in an
adjoining field allowing us to get near enough to take a cine picture.
This picture, however, did not come out because the native who did
the developing used hypo for developing and developer for fixing.
It may be of interest to give particulars of how the natives catch these
Cranes. A hole, sufficient to hold two " Boys 55 is dug, then covered
over with brushwood to resemble the surrounding ground. For a few
days grain is scattered near the hole thus encouraging the birds to feed
at this spot. One day two natives get into the hole, cover it over as
formerly, wait until the birds come near enough, grasp them by the
legs and pull them into the hole. Seldom are more than two a day
caught by this method. The Cranes appear to get wise to it and steer
clear of the hole for days or even weeks.
Regarding Flamingoes, I was informed that owing to the fact that
all East African Flamingoes feed on the small plants, Snails, fish, etc.,
of a particular kind that are only found in the swamps at the edge of the
soda lakes, 1 it is impossible to keep them alive in captivity ; that
unlike Egyptian Flamingoes they will not thrive on shredded shrimps,
soaked grain, or meat scraps. Whether this is so or not I cannot answer,
but it is the common belief in East Africa, so common that no one
appears to have tried the experiment ; in point of fact I was astonished
at the lack of interest in aviculture, as we know it in this country. In
all my search I only found one private person with an aviary and
therein were a very indifferent pair of Green Budgerigars. A few
dealers have aviaries with the larger types of birds, Turocous, Cranes,
Ostriches, etc., housed near leopards, hyenas, etc. I would account
for this lack of interest in the smaller beautiful birds to the fact that
everyone's attention appears to be focused on the big game that
abounds in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika, the shooting of which
appears to be a greater conquest than keeping the magnificent feathered
creatures alive in aviaries.

Members of the Club, 23 ; guests, 9 ; total 32.
The Chairman said it gave him very great pleasure to welcome
Mme. Jeanne Derscheid as a Guest of Honour. The articles of the
late Dr. Derscheid were well known to all readers of the Avicultural
Magazine. What impressed him so much was the wonderful courage
of the man, who could not only write articles on birds, but also
illustrate them while under the terrible conditions of imprisonment.
Dr. Derscheid held a unique place in the affections of British avi-
culturists, and the Club was honoured and proud to pay tribute to
his memory through Mme. Derscheid.
The Club presented a bouquet of red carnations, tied with the
Belgian national colours, to Mme. Derscheid as a token of regard.
Another very welcome guest was M. R. D. Etchecopar, Secretaire
general, La Societe Ornithologique de France.
M. Etchecopar said he felt very flattered to be asked to attend,
especially as he was not an aviculturist but an ornithologist. He
described briefly the difficulties experienced in producing UOiseau
during the war, but thought that in future this journal would be
published at regular intervals.
Mr. K. A. Norris showed a selection of his remarkable, hand-
coloured slides. The series represented the birds of marshland and
foreshore in Holland. Some idea of the ground covered may be
gathered from the following : Little Black Tern, Purple Heron,
Montagu's Harrier with nest of three young ones in varying stages of
development, Long-eared and Short-eared Owls brooding, Avocet,
Redshank, Black-tailed Godwit, Ruff in display and Reeve, Kestrel
and nest on ground in heather, Kentish Plover, Ringed Plover and

some two thousand pairs of Cormorants near Rotterdam.
The Chairman, thanking Mr. Norris, said it was one of the finest
and most interesting exhibitions he remembered seeing, and he
warmly congratulated him on his skill and success as a photographer.
These remarks were reflected in the sustained applause accorded
Mr. Norris.
The date of the next meeting is Wednesday, 11th May. It is
hoped that M. Jean Delacour will be present.
Many members do not seem to appreciate the importance of the
meeting notice cards. At most of the dinners there are members who
have not expressed their intention to be present. To enable the
Secretary to complete the organization of the dinners the cards must
be used.

The Duke of Palmella, Portuguese Ambassador, has presented four
Spanish Blue Magpies to the London Zoo. The Duke brought them
from Sesimbra, south of Lisbon, when he returned to this country
earlier in the year.
Sydney Porter, the much-travelled, has i been wintering in
California. He has been staying with F. H. Rudkin, jun., and has
visited many of the larger aviaries. At the last time of writing he was
waiting for the snows to clear on the mountains before going up to
endeavour to see the now very scarce California Condor.
A. H. Scott has, as usual, been wintering in Switzerland. Writing
from Grans-sur-Sierre, he says : 4 4 This is the most bird-less Swiss
resort I've yet struck. Hundreds and hundreds of rowan trees all
loaded with berries, though leaves are gone, and not a bird to eat them.
Even above 6,ooo ft. there are usually Bullfinches to eat them off.
Years ago I caught some in St. Moritz, and brought them back to
England."
Dave Bush, writing at the end of January, says : "Just returned
from New Guinea. We leave for London, via Africa, on the Nestor
from Sydney about 9th February. I suppose it will be about the end of
March when we arrive in London. Had a very nice trip and brought
back the following varieties of stock, some of which were secured by

The Silver Medal for the outstanding breeding achievement of the year was awarded
to Dr. Lendon for the Pileated Parrakeet.
Dr. Lendon writes :--
" All Mr. Knuckey's breedings were from the shipment of African birds received
by him in 1947 and referred to in my previous letter (A.M., 1948, 97) ; there
are still several others that he may succeed in breeding. In contrast to last year,
you will notice that no softbills were bred. Mr. McKechnie twice hatched a
young Southern Scrub Robin ( Drymodes brunneopygius) , but on each occasion the
young bird disappeared on the day of hatching."

Avian Imports.
Several readers have inquired whether it is possible to clarify the situation regarding
the importation of birds.
The following extracts are from a recent letter from a very high-ranking official
of the Board of Trade and explain the reasoning behind their policy :--
" The restrictions on these imports are due to the ever-present problem of our
balance of payments. The amounts involved may not seem large but these small
items, when taken together, tend to add up to quite a substantial sum. Once we

<bodyText confidence="0.980819529411765" page_id="56311787"  page_num="77" year="" vol="">
commence to relax upon the import restrictions there is the problem of deciding
which items merit first consideration and I think you will agree that birds and pets
could not come very high on the list.
" There is a particular difficulty in the case of seed-eating birds in that supplies
of bird seed are insufficient to meet current needs and these supplies can only
be increased at the expense of other types of feeding-stuffs. The same sort of
problem arises, to a limited degree, on imports of other types of pets.
" Some import licences are issued for imports intended for educational or research
purposes, such as the imports by zoos, but these relate in the main to transactions
which do not call for any expenditure of foreign currency. Also imports are
permitted for total re-export provided the business results in a currency profit
to this country : this is in keeping with our policy to foster entrepot trade but the
benefits of such trade would be largely dissipated if we were to allow some of the
imports to remain in this country, also we obviously could not permit a tolerance
of this nature in the case of birds and pets without considering a similar concession
on other commodities, and the loss of potential currency earnings would be corre-
spondingly increased.
" . . . (regarding) the facilities already accorded to imports of quadrupeds
from the British Empire. The volume of these imports, apart from agricultural live-
stock, is not large and generally they relate to types which serve a useful purpose in
our economy : the policy is kept under review and further restrictions will be
imposed should these prove necessary."

Mr. J. Clinton Bond, late Curator of the McMahon Museum, Quetta, sent a
number of non-competitive exhibits, five Eastern Goldfinches, four Pink-winged
Desert Finches, and a pair of Red-mantled Rose Finches. The two first named were
all males, but I am given to understand a number of females had been kept at home.
The only exhibit from abroad was a Venezuelan Siskin X Roller Canary, flown
from Paris. This " Red Canary " proved a great attraction, but for some unknown
reason it was labelled as having an " Abyssinian Siskin " as a parent.

The John Frostigk Memorial Cup.
T. Crewes was the winner of this Cup at the &amp;lt;{ Crystal Palace " Show. His* four
nominated foreign birds scored 27 points ; three firsts and one second.
Grey Parrot Bred at Brighton.
Considerable interest was caused at the recent National Show by a young Grey
Parrot exhibited by H. A. Avery. It was labelled " Bred at Brighton " ; and its
parents were also on show. Avery then gave me brief particulars and in confirmation
writes as follows :--
" Regarding the young African Grey, this was born in about April, 1946,
and is probably about thirty-two months old. It was born out of doors in a
secluded and sheltered aviary. The parents made the nest on the ground after
I had removed the nesting-boxes--having made six previous attempts, all of
which were very disappointing, I eventually decided to give them a rest. I had
two pairs of Greys in flights adjoining, and the six previous attempts were made
with these four birds. This last nest contained two eggs ; one with chick dead in
shell, practically fully developed, and the other produced the bird you saw at the
Show. I left the parents to themselves only placing daily a supply of soft and
ordinary food."
This noteworthy breeding success was, of course, about a year after E. J. Boosey's.

A DESERT EAGLE OWL
By J. G. Mavrogordato
The Desert Eagle Owl {Bubo ascalaphus desertorum) is, even for an
Owl, an exceptionally handsome bird. It is one of the smaller Eagle
Owls, and its coloration harmonizes, as one would expect, with its
desert habitat. The general ground colour of its plumage is " old
gold ", brindled with dark sepia, and spotted with white. It is, of
course, eared, and has strikingly handsome eyes of a glorious orange
colour.
In the Sudan it lives on the little rocky hills (jebels) with which the
scrub-covered desert is interspersed. These jebels are normally
waterless and practically devoid of vegetation, but contain an infinity
of caverns and caves of every shape and size. The surrounding
country is arid scrub, that is, sand or gravel dotted more or less
sparsely with thorn bushes and an occasional tree. The jebels with
which I am myself familiar lie within two or three miles of the Nile,
to the North of Omdurman.
The numerous castings scattered about an occupied jebel provide
a fairly accurate clue to the feeding habits of this Owl. Rodents
(rats, mice, jerboas, jerbilles) not unnaturally provide the bulk of
its food. Scorpions are, however, a surprisingly common ingredient
in the castings. Feathers are rare, but I have found Sand Grouse
feathers, and suppose that these Owls sometimes find an opportunity
of pouncing on a jugging bevy of Sand Grouse.
Little seems to be known of their nesting habits, and it required
three years of intermittent search of jebels known to. be occupied by
resident Eagle Owls before I found (in April, 1948) the fledgeling which
I now have. Even so I cannot claim to have found the actual nest,
for the little cave into which the young Owl retreated on my approach
showed no greater signs of occupation than any of the surrounding
caves, and I could find no trace of any other member of the family.
Although not yet able to fly this Owl was a strong runner, and

J. G. MAVROGORDATO-A DESERT EAGLE OWL

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.990251918918919" page_id="56311796"  page_num="80" year="" vol="">
about the rocks to relieve his boredom.
This young bird is of a somewhat nervous disposition, and when
first taken used to indulge in a good deal of beak-snapping ; he can
give a shrewd bite with his beak, but has never made any aggressive
use of his feet.
His appetite is small for his size ; or at least for his apparent size,
for he weighs only i- |lb. For reasons of convenience, I found it
necessary in Khartoum to change his diet from fur to feather, and
used to feed him on House Sparrows, Golden Sparrows, Pigeons, or
Doves. Feeding time was at dusk every evening, and a suitable ration
appeared to be about four Sparrows, half a Pigeon, or two-thirds of
a Dove (the ubiquitous Mourning Dove). During his holiday at the
London Zoo (which kindly offered him hospitality during my leave),
his daily ration, I am told, consisted of three or four white mice.
Though I give him water (in a shallow Pigeon bath), I cannot say
if he drinks, but he certainly paddles.
In Khartoum I kept him in a lean-to aviary, about 4 yards long by
2 yards wide by 2 yards high, floored with sand and having a small
rock-built cavern in one corner. At first he used to retreat into his
cavern when alarmed, as well as for a siesta during the heat of the
day, but latterly he seemed to prefer sitting on a perch outside, unless
the heat was extreme. In fact, as with the adult Owls, which are
in the habit of sitting out on rocks in the full light of the sun in the
mornings and evenings, bright sunlight seems to cause him no incon-
venience or distress, and he can certainly see tolerably well in it.
In England, having no aviary available, I used to keep him in a
shed at night, and on fine days pegged him out in a sheltered corner
of the garden on a bow-perch, to which he was attached by jesses,
swivel, and leash, like a trained hawk. This method appeared to
suit him very well, and the constant handling involved served to keep
him a good deal tamer than if he had been left to his own devices in
an aviary.
I cannot, of course, prophesy how this Desert Owl would stand an
English winter ; it could probably tolerate mere cold, but would
have to be carefully protected from damp and draughts.
My own bird, however, missed the experience, as he returned with
me to Khartoum at the end of October.

RAOL SHRI DHARMAKUMARSINHJI BIRDS OF PREY AS COMPANIONS 8 1
BIRDS OF PREY AS COMPANIONS
By Raol Shri Dharmakumarsinhji
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9996855" page_id="56311797"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
In India there is a great variety of birds of prey which breed in
many parts of the country, and during the autumn and winter
seasons there are large migrations of birds which invade the plains
regularly. It would take too long to mention all these birds, except
those which are well known for their use in falconry, which has
achieved a high standard in India. I am sorry to say that to-day the
art of falconry is vanishing rapidly in India, and there are few who can
really appreciate the finer points of this sport. In this article I do not
wish to discourse on the art of falconry, but to give an idea of some
birds of prey as human companions. As a Hawk grows older in
captivity we trouble less about making it perform, and she becomes
more attached to her master as time progresses. Moreover, in spite
of the companionship of a bird to a man, one often expects some sort
of display or work worthy of the bird's ability, which may be quite
voluntary and irrespective of the fundamentals of the art of falconry.
Let us take the Goshawk. She has been condemned by many
except the Oriental falconers who prize her most, but not without
reason. Once a man becomes attached to his Goshawk I do not
think he will sell her for a thousand ! The sentimental value in the
East is something that should be understood by the West. The per-
formance of the Hawk may be little, but the sentiment value great.
The Taj Mahal, with its splendour and architectural beauty, amazes
everyone, but I was told that an American visitor asked how many
bedrooms it had got ! The difference between a Goshawk and a
Peregrine mainly lies in its size, shape, and performance, as much
as between a good gun dog and a classic greyhound. In general, for
that matter, the East cannot appreciate the Englishman's dog and the
way he keeps it. As a companion there is no Hawk to excel the
Goshawk or the Baz ; unhooded she remains at all times with cat-like
eyes. It is we who have to study her. In my memory there have
been a number of Goshawks that have passed through my hands,
but there are only some that have remained as true companions,
the reason being that it has not been customary to intermew our Hawks,
and until then the real friendship relation between man and Hawk
does not arise. Moreover, when a performance is to be seen and
shown to visitors the Hawks are keyed up and require careful handling.
I well recollect a male Goshawk which would come back to my fist
at almost any distance on my calling him, which very much amused
many of my falconer friends, who in banter termed him a Falcon.
Thereafter, I was often questioned as to how I managed this method
of training, but I could give only one answer, that I knew the Hawk
and he knew me and a real friendship existed between us two.

The " Baz " as a companion gives immense pleasure, especially
during morning and evening walks, and one does not have to think
of the multitude of falconry do's and dont's and to speak of drugs.
I have often taken out a Baz day in and day out as a companion in
the countryside, and it is a delight to watch her eyes picking up each
and every small movement ; a hare has often crossed the path, and
before one knows it the Baz has either tackled it, missed it, or not
even attempted, depending on her mood, and I have never been dis-
appointed. Sometimes she has merely chased a hare and taken her
exercise, and then as I have extended my arm from a distance and
called her she has come to my fist or has often come running on the
ground towards me to be picked up. In fact, I have never troubled
about these pseudo-flights until my wife complained about fresh
meat ! Besides, I might say that some of these flights ended in unusual
success, which made me wonder as to the length of flight and ability
of a Goshawk. I can well recollect one chase when my " Khandan "
Baz was on my fist. One evening while walking over a black cotton
field I put up a hare and my Baz, leaving my fist, made a number of
attempts which failed, but the wind being favourable she did not
give up, and at the end of my walk I was amazed to find the hare
caught in her firm grip. The distance from where the hare got up
to where it was killed must have been about 300 yards. I may tell
you, however, that all Goshawks, however well trained they may be,
will not attempt such long flights, but there are as many individual
traits in Hawks as in man, and they can be readily recognized.
Goshawks get fairly attached to their masters, as do some Falcons,
and they will come to the fist without any bait, unless they are too fat.
I have kept many kinds of birds of prey, and I feel there is much
prejudice against the Goshawk in the Western countries. Yes, she
is a moody Hawk I admit, with a bad temper, but is she not courageous
and a happy companion ? I have always felt that Western falconers
have not sufficiently studied the Goshawk. I hope I am. wrong.
If I were asked which bird of prey I would prefer for a long friend-
ship I should certainly say a good Baz. Perhaps the short flight of
the Goshawk is not so exciting, but the companionship is valued
greater. A Goshawk will take to you better, and there are less chances
of losing her. While hunting she will run around bushes and in
and out of hedges like a dog affording full amusement. She will
indicate a Francolin in a bush when you cannot see it, give you
exercise, make you think, and be much more amiable, coming to
your fist frequently. A Goshawk once attached to you will hate from
the keeper's hand as soon as she sees you ; in short, she enjoys being
on your fist. If you wish to reap the real benefit of a companion
Hawk, keep a Goshawk, study her, and let her behave naturally, for
she will be in truth a friend all your life. Perhaps I would be going

too far if I said that Hawks will respond to their masters under any
conditions.
However, I have dwelt on the Goshawk too long. Now I shall
come to the Peregrine, nay, the Shahin, for she surpasses it in tempera-
ment and fidelity. The Shahin is called the " Amir 55 in the East,
a fitting designation with the complexity of its meaning, though in
short it means a noble Falcon and a noble Falcon she is. Neverthe-
less, I bow my head to the Peregrine for courage and perseverance.
I will now tell you of a Shahin I had, which became so attached to
me that when I used to take her out in a car unhooded she would
still be quiet, in spite of the many jolts on the bad road. After her
release she had the habit of soaring to such an unearthly height as
to be out of sight, and to make us rather nervous of losing her ; but
she invariably returned when she was satiated with sunning herself.
Notwithstanding, one day, I very well remember my patience having
given out. Having called so much as to give me a sore throat and being
disappointed at her not returning, I decided to leave her where she
was, and told my co-falconer to give up hope and get quickly into
the car. No sooner had I started the engine and moved the car some
yards than I saw my Shahin next to me on the ground waiting to be
taken up to be fed. She thought that we had forsaken her, and she
dropped to earth as we started to move home, so as not to be left
behind.
Lost Shahins are well known for their reappearance at the site
where they have been released, which they do much more frequently
than Peregrines. Moreover, they become quickly attached to their
masters. In spite of these admirable qualities they do not fetch a
better price than the Peregrine.
Similar to the Shahin the Peregrine is an excellent companion,
expressing happiness by croaks and gestures and the eyes convey
much. Out of the many fine qualities that she possessed a striking
one is that of while pursuing a quarry to keep strictly to one selected
bird out of a flock throughout the flight and I have had Peregrines
which showed this. I even noticed this peculiarity, with surprise, in
Duck-hawking and I cannot exactly account for it. But you must
admit that it is a trait which must be much admired, especially when
in the face of easier quarry being available at the time. In fact, this
trait of singling out a particular bird once she has decided upon it is
seen in many kinds of Falcons, and is quite rightly considered a very
good point by Eastern falconers. Some falconers go as far as to say
that they can predict this and other good qualities of the birds by their
colour and markings.
It is interesting to note how some birds of prey quickly associate
ideas by visual signs. While hawking with Sakers it is often the case
that a hare is flushed in a field of standing cotton without the Falcons

perceiving it, and so keen are the birds at the time that they leave the
falconer's fist unhooded automatically, without seeing the quarry.
So when accompanied by horses the riders chase the hare into more
open ground, and knowing that the leading horseman is following
the hare, the Falcons follow in the direction of the leading rider, even
though he may be a great distance away, until the hare comes into
view. I have also seen the Saker Falcon hovering over or swooping
at the bush in which the hare has taken refuge at the time when the
rider has appeared on the scene. Such is the intelligence of birds of
prey, some of which is acquired by experience.
In falconry birds of prey well understand that man is a friend.
Falcons and Hawks understand the dangers of Eagles robbing their
prey, and it is instinctive to them to take shelter immediately after
they have captured their prey. I have often had tame Falcons
dragging and sometimes carrying their prey towards me in order to
escape the anticipated attacks of wild birds of prey. They also do
this to evade the intense heat. This has been very well filmed by
some of my friends. Falcons and Hawks are intelligent birds, and if
association of ideas are rightly inculcated in them, they become most
interesting companions.
To say a few words on Eagles. The Golden Eagle does not usually
occur in the plains ; nevertheless, it is perhaps the ideal of falconry.
However, we get some Eagles which can be well trained. Eagles are
generally noted for their ferocity and bad temper, but once they have
been reclaimed are quiet as lambs. I had a Tawny Eagle which would
enjoy sitting in my lap like a broody hen, and show all the affection
of a Parrot. By mentioning this, please do not be misled that I suggest
the Eagle as a pet. With exception of the poor appetite of Eagles,
they make most amusing companions. They will follow you a mile,
walking or flying in the hope of getting a morsel. Being cumbersome
birds, one does not see in them the agility of the smaller Falcons and
Hawks, but they are intelligent birds, and if we are prepared to carry
their weight, they will certainly enjoy human companionship. Eaglets
make good friends, but are not so useful in the art of falconry. A young
Tawny Eagle which I had gave out all the yells and screams of friend-
ship sufficient to attract an entire town. Well-trained Eagles become
docile but, like a caged lion which has drawn fresh blood, they become
rather unruly when on fresh prey. At this moment some instinctive
urge makes them sudden strangers, and they require careful handling.
Eagles which have been in the mews for some time, and have been
given full liberty, do not readily leave their precincts, and they
become regular visitors, yelling and screaming for meat, and woe
betide your poultry and ducks. Wild Tawny Eagles become very
tame, and I do not know why they cannot be easily bred in large
aviaries. A female Tawny Eagle which I had caught and reclaimed ,

became so tame that when she was given full liberty, never left my
compound for many months together. She sustained herself on the
bones and titbits from the kitchen. However, she was regularly
mobbed by Crows, of which she took no notice. I am afraid the end
was rather a tragic one, for a wild Eagle seized her, and the fight
resulted in her being so badly wounded that I was compelled to
destroy her. After that I had often felt that giving freedom to tame
birds of prey was a sort of cruelty. However, trained Hawks which
are freed at the end of the season are fattened, and when they regain
the urge of the wild, are let loose. The smaller Falcons, such as Red-
headed Merlin and the Hobby, make amusing pets, as do Sparrow-
hawks, Shikras, black winged Kites, and Kestrels. I imagine, in
tropical India, birds at liberty suffer much more than in colder climes.
Nevertheless, intermewed small Hawks make excellent companions,
provided one has an elementary knowledge of how to keep birds of
prey, and one may even try to go as far as enticing them to breed in
captivity. One Hobby that I had, I remember, would soar for a
considerably long time, and then swoop at the lure with sardonic
impertinence, only to rise up into the sky to look back at me as if to
say "You have no control over me ". At the end of her exercise
she would quietly settle on the small lure without any fear of being
taken up.

A PET KESTREL

Some years before the war I became the owner of a fine male
Kestrel, and during the time it was with me it grew exceedingly tame
and confiding. A friend of mine found this bird lying beneath an
electric pylon, having presumably accidentally collided with the
overhead cables. Thinking it dead, my friend brought the bird along
to me as a possible specimen for mounting, but whilst holding it
in my hand I was surprised to see it come to life and promptly seize
the fleshy part of my finger. I opened my hand, anticipating that
the Kestrel would take wing, but apart from scrambling unsteadily
to its feet and releasing my sorely tried finger it made no effort to

leave. I gave it a careful examination and could find no sign of
fractured bones, so having an enclosure vacant I placed the bird
inside and left it to settle down.
The problem that next faced me was food. It was Sunday and the
joint as yet uncooked ! With little difficulty I persuaded my mother
to cut me a portion, which in size would dwarf the present-day ration,
and cutting it into small pieces I proceeded to the aviary. Placing
the food in front of the Kestrel I retired some distance and awaited
results. I was disappointed, for apart from taking a disinterested
glance in that direction the bird fell to contemplating its new surround-
ings. I again approached, and picking up a piece of meat waggled
it in the Kestrel's face. After one or two half-hearted pecks he suddenly
took it in his beak, transferred it to his claws, and commenced tearing
off small morsels and devouring them hungrily. After that it was
plain sailing, and I never again experienced trouble in feeding.
His diet of butcher's scraps was varied as much as possible with fur
and feather to aid digestion, and beetles, spiders, and cockchafers
were also greatly appreciated. On every appearance I would be
greeted with a " mew ", varied sometimes with a cry not unlike a cat
bent on some nocturnal mischief.
Gradually the Kestrel regained the use of his wings, and the day
arrived when I decided to give him his liberty. Opening the aviary
door I saw him at last take wing, and with a farewell mew he vanished
from my ken. For some days after he revisited my garden before
finally taking to the wilds and freedom, but I never regretted my action,
for I personally consider that except for exhibition or hawking all
birds of this family are unsuited to captivity.
The Kestrel builds in a variety of places, and I have found their
nests on cliff ledges, old Magpies' nests, holes in trees, and in disused
buildings. If required, young should be taken a day or so before they
are ready to leave the nest. They are apt to become surly if taken too
soon, and are very subject to fits of screaming. A large enclosure is
necessary if the bird is to be seen at its best, and one may be lucky, as I
was, to observe at close quarters the wonderful hovering powers
peculiar to this species.

By J. F. M. Floyd
She was twins, when I first set eyes on her, crammed into a coop
up Haverstock Hill way. Who could resist those glorious orbs of fire ?
Luckily I was able to resist them in duplicate, for by their equality
in hugeness the birds were unlikely to be a pair, and by their ferocious
demeanour obviously not hand-reared. So one of her came in a box
and was tipped into an empty two-stalled stable, where she still is ;
it must have been in 5 36 or '37.
An inflexible sort of character, she remains to this day as wild as
ever---that is, she seldom waits for my near approach. Having heard
other folk on their Eagle Owls, especially when nesting, I used to
carry a rolled newspaper by way of a truncheon, harmless but alarming,
when I went in, but I have never seen her for a moment what you
could call aggressive ; just bill-snapping and bluff, making herself
look like a fan with her wings and mantle. She gives visitors a show
of flying over their heads from gable to gable, until she pops through
the window into an outside flight constructed against the back.
This never was an ideal affair, but by planting tall privet bushes
behind one end I endeavoured to give her that comfortable feeling of
shut-in-ness, a niche to which to set her back to. For a long time
we never caught her out in this flight, so painfully sewn together of
wire and extra strong wire mesh, but I used to listen at night with
a window open in great expectation of her first hoot. If only the
Eagle Owl hooted to scale in the Brown Owl's vein ! When it came
it fell far short of that, just a " hooo " now and again, not at all
impressive, though it could be heard across the lake on the high road.
However, the only notes I can find in diaries all too sketchy are vocal
ones. Here is 27th March, 1938 : " The E. Owls (pair ?) have been
much more noisy of late at night, not merely a single 4 Hoooo ' as
usual, but a double c Who-hoooooo ' and much louder, and more
frequent." Here's a hiatus ! I wonder how many aviculturists
keep detailed diaries, writing them up in the small hours. We put
our trust in memory ! The " query pair " means I had been along
to Fockelmann and ordered a male Owl that would breed. The
query implies a wonder as to whether he was a man of his word.
He was, as I rather expected. He, the Owl, came as from Munich
Zoo, and bred there ; a model bird in every way. While " she "
was flying pendulum overhead, he would stay on a perch and allow
me to stroke his head with never a snap of the bill ; much too good
for her.
The suspected nest was actually in a dark corner under the manger
of the far stall; the upper half of the stable door being open and

wire-netted. All kinds of rubbish and Owl fluff galore in which eggs
were hidden, and I didn't try to count, but stole out on tiptoe. Beware
when your handbook says " lays in scrape in ground ", it understates ;
in the breeding season the hen can dig , e.g. under a door. So your
apartments, Eagle Owl, must be made proof everywhere at ground
level. There is no point in being exclusive about it, quite the reverse.
Many a time the night has been punctuated by the crash of a pounce,
the rattle of corrugated on a former hen-house embodied in the flight,
and the squeal of a rat. I'm afraid the rats went on squealing, for
these raptors deserve no credit on humanitarian grounds ; it sounded
as if the Owl held the rat and cogitated, or just did nothing. A rat
was dessert in those nights of plenty or not even that. Something
to be put by and eventually removed by us. Appetites are small, a
rabbit would only lose its head, the choice bit, in the days when the
big hen lived alone.
I do not know the mouse-measure for an Eagle Owl, she doesn't
feed to order ; but for a Spotted Eagle (A. pomarina , I think, a young
bird said to come from Austria) quartered under the mill it is eight
housemice, consecutive, after a day at threshing a rick---not seldom a
mousey gold mine. In an attic over the shop where I got the little
Eagle there was a huge young Golden or Sea Eagle perched on a
towel-horse, quite untrammelled. One had to brush past to look at
some Pacas, but it did not mind a bit ; a very great temptation.
It went on the stage--at least was loosed in her boudoir by a Star, I was
told, but soon returned. My Eagle eats anything, anything remotely
part of an animal, or does it refuse a Rook or a Jackdaw ? Memory
again. I am told that Owls are dainty feeders ; during the war they
had to do with a lump of passe sausage-meat when nothing else
turned up, or even wartime sausages that were just a bit too far gone.
There must have been blank days. Good enough feather-building
stuff withal, Q^.E.D. It is convenient that the head of any prey is
the tit-bit of birds of prey ; they are well content with the heads of
poultry, one a day for Falcon, Eagle Owl, or Eagle, and a Turkey's
head lasts two days.
During one season there used to be a Jay, I suppose a former pet,
often to be seen about the apple boughs inside the flight, quite at ease.
It took little notice of me and none of the Owls, who ignored it, and
lived on pickings, but I fancy it never stayed inside to roost. An
otter hung about, outside so far as I know, sometimes disturbed by
G. of an evening on his rounds, and leaving its tracks in the snow.
One hard winter, not the last, we had a tame wild Heron--or rather
two ; but one, a large immature bird, was exclusive of the other,
though second-comer. They haunted the cages and got what they
could reach ; one used to come round one corner of an aviary and
see a Heron slip round the other, and a Heron actually used to go

through the open mill door after mice, and once to mutilate a casualty
left inside, a Peacock.
The young were a trio in buff-grey down, dimly visible under the
manger, standing upright together. I don't remember that the cock
showed any anxiety, and the hen behaved as usual or dodged outside
through the window, but I crept away and left them very much to
themselves. If the hen had been tame she might have been dangerous.
They grew fast into vast fledgelings, all eyes, more bizarre when their
ear tufts were added, odd bits of fluff persisting on top. They ought
to have been hand-reared. One of them got as large as their mother,
and two were smaller, a hen and two cocks most likely. I shut them
off from the old birds, and imagined they would be as amicable as
Owls in a zoo.
The following year there was another nest in the same place and
three more hatched, but the war was in full swing, and the supply of
fowls' heads very indifferent, and they vanished in the downy stage,
which was just as well. In one of my absences there was a sad scene
when their attendant, or rather his wife, came one morning. The
two smaller birds lay headless, and the young hen lived alone. Their
food ought to have been divided and each seen to cover its own portion,
but under the circumstances that was too much to expect. At last
there was only one Owl in the stable, as at present, when I came on
leave. There were bits of the male's wings lying about, poor amiable
bird ; of course, he may have died. The hen seems as good as ever.
On 13th February of this mild year she began to hoot leisurely,
steadily, oo-er-hooo ooer-hooo.
My Aplomado Falcon {F. fusco-coerulescens Vieill, South America)
almost lived to see the war out. There is a plate, 121, in Temminck's
Coloured Plates under F. femoralis. At first I had two of the same
size, hand-reared birds just off a boat. The same old mistake of one
cage and thinking birds liked each other's company. Of course, one
died. The other wintered out each winter perfectly well, in a deep
compartment of an aviary wired in front facing south, roofed only at
the back, so as to admit some rain. There was a question raised in
Ibis not long ago, " Do birds play ? " This bird used often to stalk
and grab invisible mice along its perch with every sign of glee, and
would pounce on your twiddled finger any time you liked. Once
I gave it a mouse alive, thinking that would be the quickest way to
kill it, but the wretch took it up in one foot to its perch, and held it
so in chancery for quite a long time. He (?) used to squeal a lot for
his own entertainment or in greeting, and was willing to enter into
a duet.
Another war casualty was a Kittiwake. This was brought in a
basket, in immature plumage, with a black bill and bold black eyes,
by a boy who found it in the Cuckfield cemetery after a winter storm.

I wondered if the white stones attracted it, shining through the
murk. It was unable to stand up, but when warmed at the kitchen
fire began by taking a few sardines and soon came round. From the
start it took command of the kitchen as far as the dogs were concerned,
a peck on the nose to the spaniel and a jab or two for one or two fox-
terriers, and that was that. It went through its allotted moult to
maturity in an aviary with a pond, where it could dominate a single
Silver Gull and even at first a pair, but eventually the pair got the
upper hand and led it a life so they had to be separated. Minced
meat and bits of fish suited it well, but it failed to survive when hound-
meal had to be substituted.
At the date of reading these proofs, 28th April, the little Eagle
has been calling all day for quite a month, and not from hunger, for
the value of fowl's lights remains nil, whatever the tone of the market.

Our Editor has asked me to contribute something to the Birds of
Prey Number, but as Little Owls are the only raptorial birds I have
kept my remarks will have to be confined to the pair of these birds
which I had for some years.
I came by them originally quite by accident. I was in a pet shop
one day and, as was usual in such intriguing places, in the mood to
buy anything interesting that took my eye, when the assistant, who
knew my taste for something a bit out of the ordinary, produced a
parrot cage containing two Little Owls.
They were obviously young birds of the year and in good condition,
so I bought them on the spot.
Having got them home, their immediate housing became a problem,
as my aviaries were full, and they had to have a place to themselves.
Eventually a compromise was made, however, and they occupied a
large flight which they shared with two Jays, a young grey squirrel,
two hand-reared wild rabbits, and some guinea pigs. The flight was
some 30 feet long, 11 feet wide, and 10 feet high.
I had some fears for the young guinea pigs, but strange to relate the
Owls never molested them even at night.
Owls have always intrigued me with their beautifully patterned
plumage, their wonderful eyes, and their slow, deliberate movements
when at rest. Whilst the Little Owls were by no means the loveliest,

their pale yellow eyes, small size, and neat shape, and particularly their
quaint habit of bobbing up and down when looking at one, made
them great favourites all the time they lived with me.
Although reputed to be hand-reared, they lost all tameness when
turned into the aviary. I provided them with a sleeping box and
they would sit at or near the entrance to this most of the day, dis-
appearing inside at one's approach, rather like Lovebirds do. If one
sat quietly in the aviary for some time, however, they would eventually
come out again and stand on one leg with usually one eye half closed,
like a couple of graven images.
As soon as one moved they would be instantly on the alert, with
both eyes wide open, staring intently at one. If one bobbed up and
down they would appear to copy one's movements, crouching low and
then drawing themselves up to their full height. The next instant
they were back in their roosting box where, if you opened the front
and looked in, they would throw themselves on their backs, displaying
their talons in self defence, the while uttering a rasping sort of screech.
They had remarkable strength in their talons for such small birds,
and their needle-sharp claws could easily pierce the skin of one's
hand, as I knew to my cost !
Their feeding was in those happy pre-war days quite simple. Raw
beef cut into small lumps was their main diet, supplemented with all
the mice and Sparrows I could catch. I used to keep mouse traps
baited with bread and set under bramble bushes in the garden, well
covered to hide them from wild birds, and it was surprising the
numbers of field mice and voles I used to catch, which kept the Owls
well supplied.
They could dismember a young rat and eat it piecemeal, but full-
grown mice were swallowed whole. Sparrows were partially plucked
before being eaten. The Owls had a wider gape than one would
suspect from their small beaks, and had a peculiarly reptilian way of
gulping down a mouse until only the hind feet and tail protruded from
their mouths, these eventually being disposed of with a final twist
of the neck.
A few hours later an oblong pellet about 2 inches in length, con-
sisting of fur and bones tightly packed together, would be all there
was to show of their meal.
Occasionally they would cast up pellets of what appeared to be bits
of leaves and green stalks. Why they ate this I do not know, unless
it was to give them " roughage " on the days when no mice were
forthcoming with their attendant fur and bones.
Quite soon after I had them I thought they were a true pair.
One was a good deal smaller than the other, as is usual with birds of
prey, and the small one was altogether less aggressive than his mate.
The following spring my surmise proved correct, as they went to

nest. Their sleeping box, of which the dimensions were about 12 inches
by 12 inches by 12 inches, had the usual hole in one side near the top,
and was one-third filled with earth. This they scratched and scraped
into a hollow at the back of the box, and eventually three round,
white eggs, not quite so big as those of a Pigeon, appeared. If I
remember rightly, they were laid on alternate days.
The hen sat assiduously for several weeks, and then one by one the
eggs vanished. Whether they got broken and the shells were removed
by the parents, or whether the young hatched and were eaten as soon
as they emerged, a common occurrence I believe with raptorial birds
in captivity, I do not know.
My Little Owls were keen on bathing, and would occasionally take
a tub during the day. As is well known, they are more diurnal than
most Owls, and mine were certainly about during the hours of daylight.
They were much more active at dusk and on moonlight nights,
however, when they could be seen flitting about in the gloom and their
yelping cries were often heard during the night.
As mentioned before, they never molested even baby guinea pigs,
and were well behaved with their other companions.
Their staring yellow eyes seemed to have an unnerving effect on
certain mammals, however, in particular my pet grey squirrel and a
young Rhesus monkey.
The squirrel occupied the same enclosure as the Owls, and normally
each ignored the other. Occasionally, however, the squirrel would
be bounding round the aviary from perch to perch, as was his wont,
and would accidentally find himself face to face with one of the Owls.
The bird would puff itself up with clicking bill, every feather
quivering with menace. For a moment Nutkin would hesitate with
flattened ears and flickering brush, wondering whether to call the
Owl's bluff, only to lose his nerve at the last moment and turn tail,
muttering and gnashing his teeth.
The monkey, too, whose cage adjoined the Owls' aviary, could
not stand those unwinking yellow eyes which stared right into his
simian soul. At first he would try and smack his lips at them as a
placatory gesture, but when they still continued to stare he would
lose his temper and curse them as only a monkey can. Still the Owl
was not impressed, until with a slow blink it would turn its head and
stare in another direction.

THE MARQUESS HAGHISUKA-THE STELLER'S AND BLACK SEA-EAGLES 93
THE STELLER'S AND BLACK SEA-EAGLES

The largest Eagles found in the cold and temperate north are the
Sea-Eagles. Our familiar White-tailed Sea-Eagle (Haliaetus alhicilla ),
is a dull grey bird ; only its white tail in the adult is conspicuous.
But we find a beautiful Steller's Sea-Eagle (H. pelagicus ), only in the
north-eastern corner of the Far East. This Eagle breeds around
Kamchatka and is found wintering in Amurland, Korea, and Japan,
but it is rarely found south of this region and some stay all the year
round in their breeding ground.
Like the White-tailed, Steller's Sea-Eagle is very fond of salmon and
other large fish which abound in large rivers, lakes, and coasts. So
the little Commander Islands are one of its noted localities. There
are many hot springs spouting near the coast of Kamchatka where
water never freezes and many Ducks choose to stay there rather than
to migrate southward during the winter. In large trees growing on
the shores of these lakes several Steller's rest and wait for Ducks and
fish. As its name implies, the Sea-Eagle, unlike the Golden Eagle,
seldom catches its prey in the air or on the land, but it is really at
home on a big sheet of water and occasionally Gulls and young seals
are also added to its menu.
Marquis Yamashina reported that on Torishima, one of the Seven
Islands of Izu lying south of Honshu, Steller's preyed solely upon another
Steller's, the Steller's Albatross (.Diomedea albatrus). This Albatross
unfortunately only comes to Torishima to breed during the winter, and
only at this particular season the Eagle appears from the north.
To me Steller's Sea-Eagle is not only magnificent for its size but is
truly beautiful among birds of prey. The large portion of its shoulders,
ample feathered talons, and slightly pointed tail are snowy white
which contrasts strikingly with the uniform rich brown of the remaining
portion of the body. Added to this, the massive bill and toes are bright
yellow in a matured bird.
In captivity Steller's makes a very fine show. It is tame and sociable
(several may be kept together) and is quite lively. The shrieking
cries of the Tokyo zoo specimens are heard for&amp;apos; a long distance in the
Uyeno park.
Many zoo animal collectors who came to Japan years ago sought
this Eagle, and if dealers were notified a sufficient time in advance,
Steller's was no more difficult to get than Lidth's Jay or Swinhoe's
Pheasant.
Steller's has a close cousin which is the Black Sea-Eagle (. H . pelagicus
niger ). Only the tail of this eagle is white, and the remaining body is
dark chocolate brown which looks quite black in a cage.

A well-known home of the Black Sea-Eagle is Korea, though
Jankowsky reported it in Sidemi near Vladivostok and Godlewsky
found it on the beach at Onon, in Dauria ; but these records are quite
old and more recent specimens were all captured in Korea. Yet it
remains a very rare bird, for only a dozen to fifteen specimens have
been captured within the last sixty years.
We know that the range of the Black Eagle is within that of Steller's.
This overlapping distribution and similarity in size and plumage to
a great extent makes the systematic position of this Eagle still somewhat
of an unsolved mystery. The late Dr. Hartert in his famous book
considered it as a distinct species, because the particular specimens he
examined had more massive bills ; but he confessed when we saw a
specimen together in Marseilles on our way to Africa that there are
not sufficient specimens in museums to justify his classification. The
Japanese " Hand-List " considered it a sedentary sub-species of Steller's
in this restricted range, but to me the Black Eagle appears a melanistic
form of Steller's.
Among Hawks and Eagles melanism is common. Chocolate coloured
individuals are found all over the world, and among certain species
melanism persists more in one district than the other. For instance
in the Gabar Goshawk {Metierax gab ar), of Africa, dissimilarity between
the grey normal and black phase is so profound that until recently,
when more complete field observations were made, people thought
they were two distinct forms. A less known, but equally good, example
is Sanford's White-breasted Sea-Eagle {H. leucogaster sanfordi) from the
Solomon Islands. When we know more about the Korean Black
Sea-Eagle, its status may come out the same as the Gabar Goshawk or
the White-breasted Sea-Eagle, but whatever its systematic position
may prove to be in the future, niger will remain a very interesting form
of Eagle. My treatment of niger as a sub-species of Steller's is only
tentative.
The first discovery of this Eagle was made by Pere Heude, a French
missionary at Zikawei, near Shanghai, who in 1884 obtained a young
one taken out of the nest in Korea. He reared his bird, enjoyed
observing plumage changes and finally it died in 1908. So we see that
Pere Heude's type specimen remained for twenty four years his close
companion, a most enviable experience no one can repeat now-a-days.
In spite of their rareness in their native land and in museums several
Black Eagles have been brought over to some European zoos. One
of the two birds brought over to Hamburg was acquired by the London
zoo, and its coloured plate appeared in the Proc. #**L Soc. in 1896.
There is also a record of it in the Berlin zoo. A stuffed black bird in
the Marseilles museum died in the zoo of that city in 1897. M. Lavauden
published an account of it with a photo in 1924.
My first acquaintance with a Black Sea-Eagle was in Korea in 1926

when Monsieur Delacour, his mother and I visited the Seoul zoo. We
admired a fine specimen of niger with a snowy white tail and sulphury
yellow bill and toes. I was much interested in this Eagle, and its
photograph was taken and given me by Mr. Shimokoriyama, the
director of the Seoul zoo. The accompanying plate of niger is the one
we saw at Seoul, and I believe it is the first photograph of a live adult
ever published. The fate of this bird was tragic ; it died in a perfect
plumage about a year later, and Mr. Shimokoriyama kindly sent the
skin to me in Tokyo. Unfortunately, however, it was during the hot
season, and owing to the carelessness in a taxidermist's shop this
beautiful skin was completely destroyed by insects.
At my request Mr. Shimokoriyama ordered Korean bird catchers
to get me one and finally sent one Eagle to Tokyo which I kept about
seven years. The Koreans seem to know something about the habit
of this Eagle and captured it without a great difficulty. As the Manchus
who value tiger's claws the Koreans prize Eagle's claws, and my poor
bird was not an exception. But it lost two or three claws before the
Director interfered to save the bird. When my Eagle a rived, its
plumage was chocolate black all over, and its light greenish bill was
an unmistakable sign of immaturity. It became very tame, and as years
went by its bill turned to yellow, and white started appearing on the
tail feathers and it became purer and purer. But it was rather to my
regret that its shoulders also had white freckled feathers instead of
turning to black. This plumage meant that my niger reached maturity
and showed some touch of Steller's on the shoulder.
One year Mr. Hagenbeck brought his circus to Japan and visited
my aviary. He was very much impressed with my Eagle and was very
anxious to take it back to Germany if I were ready to part with it.
Hagenbeck left some animals in my pen, and my Korean Black Sea-
Eagle left Japan as a member of the world famous circus.
Postscript .--When the above article reached the Editor, Miss Barclay-
Smith kindly tried to find out further details about my Eagle in
Germany, and on her behalf Mr. Robert Goombes wrote to Hagen-
beck's Zoo for information. The reply was that the Eagle with
defective claws which he had from me was killed during an air raid
in 1943, and that, strangely enough, if Mr. Hagenbeck's memory can
be trusted, this particular bird had absolutely the same plumage as
the typical Steller's. Miss Barclay-Smith's letter informing me all
this gave me a great surprise, but I incline to believe the fact is true.
In the first place there is no one more familiar with the Black Sea-
Eagle than Mr. Shimokoriyama, who was a long time Director of the
Korean Zoo (only repatriated last year). I received a bird which
appeared to him to be niger , but after several years it turned into
somewhat intermediate plumage. However, I always took it to be
nearer niger than pelagicus. During the course of about ten years in

Germany it apparently became a typical Steller's. These years of
observation are very valuable, although it has not been carried out
by one person, because such long observation on the plumage change
in any bird is not often carried out. Now, Hagenbeck's report makes
me believe more strongly that niger is a mere colour phase and not
a subspecies.
Readers will be interested to know of a somewhat similar example
in a Japanese bird which went through a colour change during its
lifetime. It is the Varied Tit, Pams varius. This cinnamon-coloured
Tit occasionally produces hepatic, albinistic, and melanistic phases,
but the hepatic is the commonest of the three. Marquis Kuroda and
Mr. Momiyama found that, after keeping hepatic individuals in
company with normal coloured birds on the usual diet, the particular
individuals turned into normal types and Marquis Kuroda reported
an extraordinary case of a hepatic bird which turned into melanism ;
gun metal colour. A coloured drawing of these birds was published
in Tori , vol. ix, pi. v, 1937.

country village with one " Pension " run by an English lady. I made
inquiries about the local birds, particularly the birds of prey which
have always been my favourites, but could not get much information
beyond a vague rumour that there were White Owls, which I soon
verified, one Barn Owl came round the pension every evening, and
that in spring " Milans royals 55 nested in the mountains. These I
found out meant the Black Kites, common on the borders of Spain,
and I thought, but without much hope, that a pair would be desirable
to add to my small collection of birds if I could procure young speci-
mens. Fortune favoured me, for I learnt from one of the tradesmen
who supplied the Pension that someone had a pair of young birds and
would part with them for a small sum, as he was tired of them. Two
days later the butcher negotiated a deal, and the next day I heard
that he had brought the birds. I hastened to inspect them, and was
confronted with a pair of screaming scarecrows, without a whole
feather between them, dirty to a degree, and evidently half starved.
The boy had driven them in front of him, and rather unnecessarily
told me that they could not fly, and were " tres vilains ". I was
taken aback, and wondered what my family would say when I reached
home, but I had not the heart to refuse the poor wretches, so bought
them for a few francs. The next week I started for home with the
Kites in a basket. I was travelling by night, but the screams attracted

more attention than I desired, and I had to submit to many inquiries
from porters and railway officials before it was decided that the
Englishwoman, being mad (as it was well known they all were), might
be allowed to proceed on her way-- ## a good riddance 35 they probably
thought ! I wondered rather nervously what anyone else would say
who might enter the same compartment, and one lady did change
into another, but then fortune favoured me, for a lady with a small
yapping dog entered, and we agreed that she would not object to
my birds if I would tolerate her dog. That was a night ! The dog
yelped incessantly and the Kites screamed and fought.
Fortunately no one else boarded our compartment and we got to
Paris unchallenged, but I had made up my mind that one Kite would
be all I could expect my long-suffering family to put up with, and that
as the station was close to the Jardin des Plantes I would deposit
the other bird there. I had all the day before me, so having seen to
my luggage I made my way to the Jardin and inquired for the bird
keeper, who was feeding his birds. After some parleying he consented
to accept one (later I received a polite letter of thanks for my gift),
and I thankfully parted company knowing that I had done the best
for the poor creature.
When my Kite and I reached home--I will pass over the remarks
made by my family (which were precisely what one would expect) --
I installed my bird in a secluded aviary until I could get a block or
jesses from the falconer at the King's House, where the then Deputy
Surveyor kept a beautiful falconry. Then my bird was placed on the
lawn, and though of course his feathers could not be replaced until the
moult, they were at any rate clean and free from vermin. He quickly
became tame, and proved the truth of the old saying, ## Where the
Kite breeds look to your lesser linen," for he would snatch a handker-
chief or duster and play with it until it was more or less forcibly taken
from him. He roosted on a bough at night and would call for his
breakfast of rabbit every morning.
In time his feathers grew and he became a very fine and handsome
bird, though not as richly coloured as the red Kite, and was accepted
as a member of the family. He liked to watch a game of croquet,
and commented on the strokes with chuckles and remarks. Mowing
the lawn was also an event for, of course, he had to be moved out of
the way of the mowing machine.
His end was a tragedy : one morning he was missing from his bough
and the leash was dangling broken. At first we hoped that he might
have got loose and flown away, but about a week later his corpse
was picked out of a rhododendron bush, and a mangy fox, who about
that time was raiding poultry, was doubtless the culprit. He died
much lamented--a beautiful gentle creature, who had endeared
himself to us all.

DILLON RIPLEY-EXPERIENCES WITH OWLS
EXPERIENCES WITH OWLS

<bodyText confidence="0.998617878048781" page_id="56311816"  page_num="98" year="" vol="">
Although by no means an Owl expert, it has fallen to my lot to keep
a few Owls at one time or another, which have been a very consider-
able source of pleasure. Far and away my favourite was a Sumatran
Bay Owl which I purchased from an Atjenese in the highlands of
north Sumatra in March, 1939. I consider this by all odds the most
beautiful of the Owl family. The Bay Owl (Phodilus b. badius) is a
smallish fellow, about ten inches tall. It is placed in a sub-group of the
Owls along with the Barn Owl. However, it is much more beautiful
than that bird. There is the same white ruff about the facial disk,
the feathers tipped with chestnut and blackish. There is the same
type of coloration on the head, back, and wings, chestnut with sparse
black spots and white spots interspersed with the black on the scapulars
and wing feathers. But the underparts are the glory of this bird.
As he sits surveying one solemnly on his perch, he presents a front
of the most delicate pinkish lilac, delicately spotted with black edged
with white. It is a beautiful colour, soft and subtle, and without
parallel.
I could never call my Owl a " Bay " Owl. There seemed to be no
sense to the name. To me he was always my Dancing Owl. He
became very tame, and whenever I fed him he would give me his little
display, gently twisting from side to side, puffed out on his perch,
so as to show the full glory of his spacious lilac waistcoat. It reminded
me almost of a hula dance. Then he would fall to feeding deliberately
and daintily, and leave off his dancing until the next time.
To my regret my Dancing Owl was very fond of birds, and while
I was in the China ports on the way home I hardened myself and
bought wretched Sparrows in the market on which to feed him.
But later on he became quite used to meat, provided I included some
roughage such as bits of feathers or bone, which he could cough up as
pellets. My little Owl never called in captivity, but another one
which I shot on the Island of Nias, off the west coast of Sumatra, had
a very distinct soft call, " who wieyou," the accent coming on the
first, ascending syllable of the second word. This species is certainly
not by any means a diurnal Owl. It always seemed to me that it
was far happier in rather dim light. Of course the species is sensitive
to cold, and the following winter, lacking a suitable inside aviary,
I had to my great regret to present my Dancing Owl to the Zoo.
In Ceylon during the late unlamented war I made the acquaintance
of the little Scops Owl (Otus b. bakkamoend ). A small bird in the grey
phase, it used to flutter in and out of my " cadjan 55 hut looking for
winged ants, and became entangled one evening in my mosquito net.

A more welcome addition than the scorpions which were also addicted
to my net, I had it placed in a cage and kept it for some time. How-
ever, whether because I gave it less attention or because its disposition
was less amenable, it never became tame as did the little Dancing Owl.
This little Scops has a soft muted call, related and resembling in a
way our native American Scops, the Screech Owl.
My latest Owl has been a large Great Horned [Bubo v. virginianus ),
the fiercest of the North American Owls. This is the fourth I have
caught on the same pole trap in my waterfowl enclosure in the
seventeen years I have had the pond. It has become remarkably
tame, and allows one to scratch the nape of its head at feeding time,
although it has only been in a cage three months. I suspect it is a
year-old bird, still fairly young, although in full plumage. These are
magnificent birds with their streaked tawny plumage, piercing yellow
eyes, and the impression of power they convey as they stare solemnly
at one. It is said that their favourite food is the skunk ( Mephitis)
that odorous creature, and yet I have never seen one which smelt
badly of skunk. I suppose they attack skunks from above in such a
way that the animals have no successful way of spraying them from
their " stern bastions ". This is a very commonly kept Owl, and
has been bred in captivity by several people, including the " non-
pareil 55 of Owl keepers, Mr. Spedan Lewis. They do well in a
roomy cage, which must have good light litter and drainage in order
to avoid the otherwise strong smell of carnivorous birds' habitations.
Nowadays, of course, it is often difficult to find enough to feed such
hearty eaters of meat, but in Connecticut we are well supplied with
pests in the shape of crows, skunks, jackrabbits, and so on, and so on,
to keep an Owl happy provided one keeps a shotgun near. So far
we have not had to give my latest acquisition meat from a " frig "
more than once in ten days.
From the point of view of aviculture Owls are all too often neglected,
and it seems a pity that this should be so. Certainly few other species
are hardier or easier to keep, and to the discerning eye their subtle
plumage patterns and symmetry are most rewarding. I suppose that
in a way Owls are the cats of the avicultural world. Like cats they
keep their own counsel and seldom respond to affection or gentle
handling. Like many felines they seem content to be admired from
a distance.

EAGLE-OWLS
By Arthur A. Prestwich
The Editor's decision to produce a special Birds of Prey number was
extremely ambitious. This very large group of birds has been severely
neglected by aviculturists. During the full half-century of the Society,
only a mere handful of members, notably Lord Lilford, Bonhote,
Meade-Waldo, St. Quintin, Gurney, Moody, Whitiey, Spedari
Lewis, and Miss Chawner, have kept them on anything like an
extensive scale. Many of us when young tried our novice hand at
keeping an Owl, or possibly a Kestrel. Those early ventures almost
invariably ended disastrously, and with the resolve " never, no more ".
Unfortunately, of course, but few aviculturists have facilities for
keeping birds of this nature, and even the few seem reluctant to do so.
The Striges are perhaps more suitable than the Accipitres for avi-
culture ; but, even so, only a dozen species have been bred in Great
Britain.

The only species to have bred in any numbers and to have become
established, even temporarily, are the Eagle-Owls, Bubo bubo and
B. virginianus. The present intention is to give summaries of the four
species of Bubo that have been known to breed successfully.
Eagle-Owl. Great Horned Owl. Bubo bubo (Linne)
Edward Fountaine bred Eagle-Owls at Easton, Norfolk, for some
twenty-five years. Gurney published an account of the first breeding
in 1849 i n Zoologist, 1849, 2452, 2566. Fountaine gave a full
account of the period 1849-1859 in the Ibis, 1859, 273. The following
is a brief summary : The female had been in confinement twenty years
before Fountaine procured her, but the male was said to be only one
year old. They were housed in a large cage, about eight feet square,
and about the same height. " The period of incubation is thirty days,
and one week usually elapses in addition between hatching the first
egg and the last."

One egg laid 13th April, the other on the 17th.
Fountaine says : " I have proved that many of the first nests were
destroyed, not from the coldness of the weather, but because the young
birds were egg-bound ; and when I was myself from home, there was
no one who understood how to take them out of the shell. I could
have saved the young bird this year if I had been at home. I found
on one occasion a young bird egg-bound, which it took me three days
to take from the shell. This bird lived and was brought up."
In the Ibis, 1859, 473, there is a note by Fountaine : " A pair of

and hatched one young bird. This is the first instance that any of
the eggs of my birds, produced by individuals bred themselves in
confinement, have proved fertile. The female which laid these eggs
is ten years old, the cock about half that age." In the account pre-
viously quoted, he had written : " Three pairs of the Owls which
I brought up in confinement have at different times laid eggs and sat
on them, but the eggs have never proved good."
From i860 to 1864, the story is continued by Henry Stevenson in
his Birds of Norfolk , vol. i, p. 47 (1866). After dealing with the earlier
successes, he writes : "In i860, a pair of young birds brought up one
nestling, but there were none from the old pair. In 1861, two young
ones were brought up by the old pair only. In 1862, an old blind
female, presented to Mr. Fountaine some time ago, paired off with a
male hatched in 1850, and two young birds were brought up. In the
same year a young pair also had one nestling, but which was instantly
devoured by its unnatural parent in consequence, says Mr. Fountaine,
c of my putting a hen's egg under her to keep her on the nest until
she was inclined to sit, and as I forgot to take away the hen's egg,
she hatched it and ate it, and served her own young one the same.' 1
No young that year from the original pair. In 1863, the blind bird
laid, but her eggs proved of no use. The old pair brought up one
nestling, and the young pair also had one young one, but the hen
bird pulled its head off when about two weeks old, in consequence,
it is supposed, of her being alarmed one night by the light of a lantern.
In 1864, another young pair nested towards the end of February,
and laid three eggs, but from the severity of the weather and high
winds all the time, there was not sufficient warmth to hatch them.
Neither the original pair, nor the blind female, did anything this
year, but another young pair had three good eggs, which should
have been hatched in the end of April, but, in Mr. Fountaine's absence,
these were unfortunately taken away under the impression they were
bad. In spite of all these disappointments, however, Mr. Fountaine
has now in his possession twenty-six of these noble birds, and has
given away thirteen others at different times. They are fed on rats,
rabbits, and small birds. A young pair of these Owls, in Mr. Gurney's
aviary at Catton, the offspring of Mr. Fountaine's old pair, also
hatched for the first time in 1860, when they brought up two young
ones ; in 1861, two more, and in 1862, three young ones. In 1863,
1 A somewhat similar incident is described in the Bull., B.O.G., xxxiii, p. xxi,
vol. v, and Ibis, 1896, 261 : " Mr. H. M. Wallis exhibited three eggs laid by a Golden
Eagle (Aquila chrysaetus), which had been about thirty years in confinement, and
began to lay eggs about fifteen years ago. The eggs having been taken and those of a
domestic fowl substituted, the Eagle hatched three of the latter and reared three
fine birds, feeding them principally on the flesh of rats. One of these fowls, a cockerel,
was slain by his foster-mother, but the others had thriven. A photograph was
exhibited, showing the Eagle and the fowls."

three were hatched and two brought up ; and, in 1864, two were
reared and presented to Mr. Fountaine, to supply this losses."
Fountaine was apparently breeding them as late as 1875, for
J. H. Gurney {Ibis, 1875, 517) writes : " Mr. E. Fountaine . . . whose
success in breeding the European Eagle-Owl in confinement was
recorded in the Ibis for 1859 (p. 273), and has been continued with
very little intermission since that period."
Sclater {P.#.S., 1869, 626) says bred at the Zoo before 1868 ; other
successes there are two bred in 1898, and one in 1899 {P.#.S., Addi-
tions) .
Meade-Waldo ( A.M. , 1900, 76) writes : " Our first nest this year
(1899) was that of the old Eagle Owls, who hatched two young ones
on April 3rd--this is fully a month later than usual. Both young were
reared : which make ninety-seven reared during my lifetime. Hardly
any eggs have been laid but what have been hatched, and no young
one has ever died, with the exception of one that was choked ; the
old pair going on year after year having their two or three young as
regular as clockwork."
Major Flower {P.#.$., vol. 1080, p. 208), says that two presented to
the London Zoo, 20th March, 1927, had both been bred in the Meade-
Waldo aviaries, one in 1882, the other in 1899.
Bonhote ( A.M. , 1910, 263) writes : " The only young one I have
reared is seven years old and still alive and well . . . The old pair . . .
persistently refuse to feed their young. In 1904, she had three nests
and hatched eight young." Later, in A.M. , 1911, 282, he says, " nests
very freely."
Miss Ghawner reared one young one in 1913, from birds bred by
Meade-Waldo. The young one passed into the possession of Sir G.
Tyrwhitt-Drake. For the five years previous the hen had laid two
clutches and incubated them without result. A later young one is
mentioned, but there is no confirmation of its being reared. In 1915,
however, another young one was fully reared {B.N., 1913? 237 ; 1914,
246 ; .1915* 260 ^ - 4 .AT. Club , 1913, 32 ; 1914, 69).
Whitley had a pair that successfully reared young in 1929 and
following years ; three bred in 1929, teste Delacour {A.M. 1930, 261).
Dr. Hopkinson ( A.M. , 1931, 314) records two bred in 1930, and says
that at the time of his visit in 1931, " The hen is sitting on half-grown
young."
Miss Ghawner (. A.M. , 1928, 277) recording the results for 1928 in the
Spedan Lewis Owlery writes : " Three eggs laid and all hatched ; the
third nearly a week after the others. All went well for six weeks, and
a plentiful supply of rabbit was given twice daily. But just as the
nestlings had begun to feather and were using their wings they all
' went light 5 and died in a few days."
Moody says the species " appears to be a free breeder, very hardy,

American Eagle-Owl. Greater Horned Owl. Bubo virginianus

William Borrer, in his Birds of Sussex , p. xvii (1891) writes : " Con-
cerning the Owls formerly in the Keep of Arundel Castle, which
I believe were generally supposed to be Eagle Owls, and were men-
tioned as such by Mr. Knox in O.R. , p. 91, as they were for many
years a great attraction to visitors ... I may say that when I saw
them many years ago I had no doubt that they were the Virginian
species, in which opinion I am confirmed by the following notice in
the Beauties of England and Wales , vol. xiv, p. 82, by F. Shoberl, where,
speaking of the Keep of Arundel Castle, he says : ' The Owls which
are kept here were a present to the Duke from North America.' This
was published in 1813. Mr. J. H. Gurney kindly made enquiries for
me of the present Duke, who most courteously gave all the information
in his power, stating that he believed it to be the fact that the Owls
were introduced into the Keep by Charles, the nth Duke, who
died in 1815, and that some were still remaining when he himself
came to the title in i860, but that during his minority they gradually
disappeared from the Castle, though two were remaining in a garden
in the town up to the end of 1869. Mr. Mostyn, the Duke's agent,
kindly forwarded me a letter from an old man, for many years the
custodian of the Owls, who states that they occasionally bred in the
Keep, producing but one egg in the season, and hatching it ; but in
1859 one bird laid three eggs, which produced three fine young,
which grew to maturity. One of the Owls, which had long been
known as c Lord Thurlow ', at last laid an egg, which was the subject
of considerable amusement. Mr. Gurney had a cutting from the
West Sussex Gazette of 1859, stating that one of the Arundel Owls,
believed to be the original c Lord Thurlow ', had just died, supposed
to be about a hundred years old."
Miss Chawner reared one young one in the Spedan Lewis Owlery
at Wargrave in 1928 ; A.S. Medal (A.M., 1928, 97, 195 ; 1929, 101,
198). In the 1928 volume (p. 251), G. H. Gurney gives some extracts
from his grandfather's diary for 1873 ; from these it appears that two
young were hatched, but whether they were actually reared to
maturity is not stated.

By P. W. Teague.
Many years ago I kept a Barn Owl as a pet.
It was in full adult plumage when given to me and I should say
from its beautiful condition and lovely plumage that it was a young
cock bird, and under a year old.
The name 44 Dayo 99 was given to him, probably because he would
come to me in daylight when called, and he was an interesting and
most useful pet for he kept our stable loft free from rats and mice,
as we had no cats.
For a time he was kept in a good sized box cage and later on he
was given the freedom of our stable loft where he lived for about three
years, and later on given his complete freedom.
44 Dayo 95 got very tame and would come when his name was called
and would perch on my hand or shoulder, and take his food from my
hand.
He was always very gentle and never once attempted to claw or
savage anyone--although he knew a stranger and would keep out of
sight when possible.
He usually slept on the wall ledges just under the roof, and would
occasionally give me quite a start if I happened to go to the loft for
hay or chaff. Silently and suddenly appearing from 44 nowhere 5 9 --
4 4 Dayo 99 would perch on my shoulder or head without the slightest
warning, for these owls are quite silent when in flight.
44 Dayo 99 was fed on pieces of meat, mice, rats, voles, bits of rabbit,
and very occasionally a sparrow.
I always gave him a dish of water, but he did not drink much and
I never remember seeing any trace of his having had a bath, yet he
always appeared clean and in beautiful plumage.
Whilst on the subject of Owls, it may be of interest to mention an
experience I had recently with that little fiend, the small Grey Owl.
I saw two fighting under an apple tree some 50 to 60 yards from the
road, so I climbed the railed fence and walked up to the combatants
and put my hat over them. I brought both home and put them in a big
packing case where they soon renewed their fighting again--so I

destroyed them. Some may ask why, well, I think more small Grey
Owls would be destroyed if they were half as well known as I know
them. In broad daylight I have seen these little fiends kill full grown
Thrushes, Blackbirds, chickens 4 to 6 weeks old, almost half grown
Partridges, Pheasant Chicks, and all kinds of our smaller birds.
Like the grey squirrel they do far more damage than good. As it is,
our small bird population have far too many enemies without the
addition of these destructive aliens.

The Chairman, in welcoming Mr. Delacour as guest of honour
pointed out that this was really a contradiction in terms for if anyone
was an essential part of the Avicultural Society it was Mr. Delacour;
he was a Vice-President and had been a member of the Society for
thirty-three years, twenty-seven of which he had served on the Council
which constituted a record, but the Club wished to have an opportunity
of expressing their feelings of appreciation. Miss Barclay-Smith
then paid tribute to the great work Mr. Delacour had done for avicul-
ture in general and the Society in particular, and said the Society
would not have survived the war years without his constant help and
support which he had ceaselessly given in spite of great difficulties.

She added that aviculture was not purely concerned with the successful
keeping and breeding of birds in captivity, but it had its part to play
both in the science of ornithology and in bird preservation--
Mr. Delacour was the embodiment of all that aviculture should stand
for--he was the greatest aviculturist in the world, he was a very
distinguished ornithologist and he was President of the International
Committee for Bird Preservation. The Chairman concluded by telling
Mr. Delacour how glad his friends were to have him among them
again and, though they greatly regretted his migration to another
continent, so long as he maintained his strong homing instinct which
he had so commendably shown he could be forgiven this lamentable
lapse. The Chairman then welcomed Mr. Jean-Paul Harroy, the
Secretary-General of the newly formed International Union for the
Protection of Nature, stating how honoured the Club was by his
presence and drawing attention to the great importance of his work.
Mr. Delacour expressed his great pleasure at once again being with
his friends in England and thanked the Chairman for her kind words.
His associations with the Avicultural Society had been a long and close
one, and time had not weakened his feelings towards his British
colleagues. Every year since 1946 his summer " migration " from
America had been a little longer ; his present visit in Europe would
last three and a half months, a good part of which would be spent
on this side of the Channel. He then made the following remarks :
" I want to take this opportunity to point out the importance of avicul-
ture as an art and as a science. It is no doubt a delightful hobby and for
all of us here, successful bird-keeping and breeding are activities from
which much pleasure and interest are derived. But it has a greater
significance. Aviculture can play a considerable part in saving a
number of species which are becoming rare and are threatened with
extinction in the near future. The increase of the human populations
of the earth and the penetration of the remotest parts of the world,
coupled with disorder and lawlessness, which are constantly extending
cause increasing destruction and prevent efficient measures of con-
servation in many regions. Particularly with the larger birds such as
game birds, Waterfowl, Pigeons, Parrots, etc., captive stock can be
established so that the existence of the species is made safe. Few
people realize perhaps that the Swinhoe Pheasants, common to-day
in aviaries, all came from a few specimens imported eighty years ago,
as also do the Brown Eared-Pheasants, now perhaps extinct in northern
China, three specimens only of which were brought to France in 1862
for the first and last time. The importance of propagating rare birds
in captivity has now been recognized particularly by the U.S. Govern-
ment, who have set up projects for the rearing of the Trumpeter
Swan, and by the Hawaian authorities, who are now planning to save
the native Goose--or Nene--which is dangerously nearing extinction.

" Another very important function of aviculture is the recording
of data that is difficult and even often impossible to obtain from the
observation of wild birds in their haunts. Such truth has been very
vividly brought to my notice in the preparation of different works,
particularly the recently complex manuscript of The Pheasants of the
World , and in the preliminary studies of The Waterfowl of the World ,
which I am now starting. Very little is known and there is too often
nothing recorded of the behaviour, displays, habits, breeding, and
incubation of even quite common species, such as, for instance, the
Golden Pheasant. The eggs, chicks, and moults of many others are
particularly unknown. No description of the chicks of the Koklass,
a species which has been reared several times in captivity, can be
found in literature and no specimens existed in any collection until
quite recently. Aviculturists can fill up these gaps in ornithological
knowledge. I beg you to record carefully what your birds are doing,
and to preserve and send to museums any available specimens of
eggs and chicks. It will contribute to the advancement of zoology
more than you might yet realize and it will also help our Editor
a great deal in making the Avicultural Magazine ever more
interesting and valuable."
Mr. Harroy expressed his great pleasure in being given the oppor-
tunity to meet such a representative gathering of English aviculturists.
He felt specially honoured as he was a fellow guest of that very eminent
ornithologist, Jean Delacour. Mr. Harroy gave a brief account
of the research work being carried out in the Belgian Congo and
extended a warm invitation to members of the Society to visit the
Institute for Scientific Research of Central Africa there.
Sydney Porter described briefly his recent visit to California.
Aviculture, he said, is in a very flourishing state. Apart from the large
collections there are many smaller about which one rarely hears, the
majority kept by ladies. Some of the better-known are those of F. H.
Rudkin, Senr., who although nearly ninety years old, maintains
unaided about a hundred aviaries : Eric Kinsey whose vast collection
is restricted to California native birds and whose success at breeding,
including Woodpeckers, is phenomenal ; Mrs. Gilbert Lee who has
bred Grey Parrots to the fourth generation ; and David West who,
while still only about twenty, has one of the best collections of Parra-
keets in California. It is to be hoped that Sydney Porter himself will
give us a full account, so in anticipation we will limit his remarks to
the foregoing.

E. N. T. Vane has recently added pairs of Yellow-cheeked Parrots
and Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (sp. incert) to his collection.
They are believed to be true pairs, so developments are expected.
E. J. Boosey recently visited Woburn, and writes : "It was thrilling
to see among other rarities a flock of, I think, no less than thirty of the
lovely Red-breasted Geese." The Duke of Bedford hopes to move
what is left of his collection at Lindfield to Woburn, and also to have
a few Parrakeets at liberty.
Alex. Hampe, who in pre-war days sent so many rare Chinese
birds to aviculturists in England and America, now finds life in
Germany very difficult and complicated, even though he is living in
the American Zone. He is unfortunately without birds, and says,
" Aviculture in Germany is altogether at the lowest ebb possible."
Readers who have been so fortunate as to see slides from photo-
graphs by K. A. Norris, will be interested to hear he is now with
J. F. M. Floyd in the Camargue. We shall hope to see the results in
due course. Incidentally, Norris showed slides to illustrate " Birds of
the Marshland and Sea-shore of Holland 55 at the Scientific Meeting
of the Zoological Society of London, on 12th April, 1949.
On 17th May, Peter Scott left to join an expedition sponsored by the
Arctic Institute of North America. Its main object is to study bird
life in the Queen Maud Gulf area, north of Canada and some two
hundred miles south of the North Magnetic Pole. The greater part
of the study will be carried out by air.

There are many books on British birds, but none quite like this one,
dealing, as it does, not only with the birds to be found wild in Britain,
but also with those that may be met with here in a state of domestica-
tion. It is quite a large book of some 570 pages, full of matter that is
all well worth reading, for Frances Pitt is a first-rate naturalist and
what she does not know about birds and beasts, at any rate those of
this country, is hardly worth knowing.
In Part I we are given a general Review of Birds, their place in
nature, structure, distribution, migration, and behaviour. The
chapter on structure being particularly useful, explaining, as it does,
the great difference between, say, the tails, wings, or feet of the various
groups, and their adaptation to particular habits and environment.

Part II deals with the various families, commencing with the Grows.
Native British birds very properly receive the most attention, and
they are dealt with very thoroughly, but others, even the Parrots,
are not neglected. Of that delightful bird, the Avocet, the author
expresses the hope that it will re-establish itself as a breeding species
in Britain, a hope that is now being realized, for it has bred here during
the last two years.
This book is very generously illustrated, both in colour and mono-
chrome. As a frontispiece is a lovely coloured plate of a pair of
Goldfinches, by Winifred Austen, while that excellent artist, Roland
Green, has contributed no less than sixteen plates, beautifully drawn
and coloured, each figuring some five or six species. The photographic
illustrations, of which there are a large number, are all very good.
One hesitates to suggest that just a few of these might have been
omitted, but the book would have been equally valuable had such
domestic birds as the Canary and farmyard Ducks and Geese been
left out, and we hardly want so many photographs of the Mute Swan,
one of which is printed twice over (pages 42 and 344) ; neither do
pictures of Parrots, Golden Pheasants, or the Lyre Bird seem quite to
fit into a book of this kind ; and if the Satin Bower Bird must be
included, it is a pity that the bower should be described in the caption
as the " nest
This is a really excellent book, a worthy successor to others from
the gifted pen of Frances Pitt who, in addition to the text and many
of the photographs, has supplied some useful line drawings.

Predatory Birds of Great Britain. By Eric Parker. The British

recall days when one's own idea of bliss went with a gun, even a cata-
pult, and things done one would prefer to forget. However when the
writer of the Foreword tries to grow the wings on the Keeper, as
virtually Warden of the Dawn Chorus (and it must be admitted that
tragedies do happen where the Sparrow-hawk goes his round), one
remembers an Osprey settled on a loch in Forfar, when an attempt
was being made to reintroduce the Osprey, shot for stuffing by the
keeper on a certain estate, and the apology tends to seem naive even
academic, keepers doing just as they like in such matters, not un-
naturally. The transition, or evolution, Keeper to Wild Life Warden,
is no doubt taking place and we should all like to see the Keeper's

position reinforced in dealing with the collector, the present maximum
fine of one pound an egg reveals itself as quite inadequate.
One would probably say with Major Buxton " I like an Eagle
much better than a Hare, a Harrier much more than a Pipit 53 or
words to that effect. One has never had the luck to see an Eagle
among the Grouse, a Falcon successfully stoop, or even a Sparrow-
hawk ; amenities not to be met with every day. It is unfortunate to
have associated Eagle and Falcon in such company as the Carrion
Grow ; practically nailing them on the dreadful Tree. Indeed the
classification here seems arbitrary--you can picture " Sportsman 35
scratching his head over the Falcons ; Eagle and Eagle go naturally
together--Aquila with Haliaeetus, and then Buzzard, but the natural
group of Falcons is peppered any old how ; it is not classification
by size ; give it up.
More than thirty pages of Schedules of Protection, county by county,
bird by bird, " unravelled 35 and set in order by Miss Barclay-Smith,
tempt you to the verge of vertigo, should prove most beneficial to our
fast vanishing species, and I am glad to know (living in Sussex) that
it is only at rabbits they are shooting on a Sunday.
Interesting local names are given, translated where possible, in
English (nicknames), Welsh and Gaelic (more Bardic, " Ruddy o 5
the Burn, Gleaner of the Hunt ").
Gulls ! That Great Black-back, most imposing ornamental, they
have forgotten the old ruffian's finishing patch of scarlet on yellow bill ;
but eighty-odd pages, well and legibly produced, for three shillings
post free ! And, drawings by Lodge. Consider the Hobby, highway
bound with visor black.
This little book could awaken observation, of the living rather than
the dead, admiration !

Roseate Cockatoo X Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo Hybrid.
Mr. D. Bush, knowing my interest in such matters, kindly informed me that there
was a Galah X White Cockatoo hybrid living at the Royal Hotel, Tenterfield,
N.S.W.
The owner, Mr. J. C. Munro, has been to considerable trouble to trace the breeder
of this bird. It appears that twenty-four years ago, the late Mr. John French had

the parent birds, both good talkers, mated over seven years before they nested in a
short, hollow limb. Two young ones were reared, but unfortunately one managed to
escape.
Mr. Munro describes his Cockatoo as follows
" The hybrid, which is approximately the same size as a White Cockatoo,
has plumage of an apricot colour from her beak to the base of the tail. The crest
is of a deeper apricot shade, lightening off until the top of the head is pure white.
The back and wings are grey splashed with white feathers."
The bird that escaped was a male similar in colouring, but more pronounced,
the breast being a vivid orange.

Additions to the London Zoo.
February , 1949. --There were only two new arrivals during the month : a Lesser
Moorhen ( Gallinula angulata ), a species new to the Collection, caught at sea offBeira,
Portuguese East Africa, presented by C. W. Benson ; and a Stanley Crane.
March , 1949. --The thirty-one additions contained no rarities. The more interesting
were a Giant Whydah, a Cinnamon Teal, a Blue-winged Goose, and a Rosy-billed
Duck.
Ten Golden and ten Reeves's Pheasants were transferred from Whipsnade. The
only new arrivals at Whipsnade were eight Golden Pheasants, one cock and seven
hens.

" Centenarian " Macaw Lays Eggs.
A Red and Blue Macaw at the Brighton Aquarium recently gained considerable
publicity in the daily Press by virtue of the fact that at the reported age&amp;apos;of 125 years
it had laid two eggs. But acceptance of its reputed longevity must be considered with
more that a modicum of reserve. Inquiry of the Aquarium management produced
the reply :--
" Our Macaw # Robert 5 was purchased some fifteen months ago from a dealer
who had then recently acquired it from a spinster who had just died. The bird was
known to have been in her family for at least 125 years and it is quite possible that
this bird is considerably older."

SEXING BLUE-FRONTED AMAZONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.980897682926829" page_id="56311831"  page_num="113" year="" vol="">
I think I have at last discovered the way to sex Blue-fronted Amazon Parrots, and
it now seems so obvious that I can't imagine why I never noticed it before.
On the bend of the wing Blue-fronts have a patch of bright colour which is normally
entirely hidden by the overlapping breast feathers. During the display, however, the
wings are slightly lowered and thrust forward by both sexes, thereby bringing these
patches of colour into prominence. At present we have eight Blue-fronted Amazons
at Keston, and in each case the colour patches are either pure crimson or crimson
at the back shading through orange into bright yellow in front.
In both the two nesting pairs the cocks have precisely the same tricoloured wing
patches, while in the hens they are pure crimson.
I went to have a look at a supposed " pair " we have which, despite their bright
colouring, I have long suspected might be two hens, and sure enough both have
the colour patches pure crimson. A recently obtained Blue-front showed the tri-
coloured patch, so I put him in the aviary with the above-mentioned couple, and
he at once showed every sign of pleasure and displayed to both of them.
Finally, a very quiet and retiring Amazon--an alleged cock Blue-front--has just
been received. It struck me as temperamentally very unlike a cock bird, and as
soon as I had a chance to examine it closely, there, as I expected, were the two pure
crimson wing patches.
I do not, of course, claim yet that this is conclusive, but it is, at any rate, a very
striking coincidence that out of eight Blue-fronts five should have identically the
same pure crimson wing patches, and the remaining three tricoloured ones, equally
identical.
Finally, with regard to the mating up of Amazons. This, I believe, is sometimes
considered to be such a tricky business as to necessitate the prospective bride and
bridegroom spending weeks in separate cages side by side, before it is safe to put
them together.
Personally I think this does perhaps apply to African Greys, but not to Amazons,
which temperamentally are so utterly dissimilar.
My own experience is that any normal male Blue-front which, without previous
introduction, is put into an aviary with any normal female Blue-front, takes to her
just as quickly as would Roseate Cockatoos under similar circumstances.
I say " normal ", because, of course, one does, particularly among members of
the Parrot tribe, occasionally come across eccentric individuals which, though often
friendly enough to human beings, seem to have a fanatical hatred of all other Parrots,
regardless of their sex.
Such birds are quite unmateable, and are usually, I think, slightly mental, and are
best segregated, as they are a very real menace to any other Parrot they are put with.

<bodyText confidence="0.994876666666667" page_id="56311839"  page_num="115" year="" vol="">
Distribution. --Confined to the south-western corner of Western
Australia and not extending north of the Moore River or east of
Esperance.
Description. --A medium-sized, rather slim Parrot, characterized by
a greatly elongated upper mandible. The adult male is deep green
on the back and wings and yellowish-green on the rump and sides of
the head. The cap is a deep crimson, the breast and abdomen are
purple and the under tail-coverts are red with a slight admixture of
green. The adult female differs in that the red cap is never quite as
vivid and sometimes has a few greenish edges to the feathers, and the
breast is duller and rather more violet than purple. In addition there
is usually relatively more green on the sub-caudals. The oft-repeated
statement that the female differs but little from the immatures is quite
incorrect. The immatures differ from the adults in that the cap is
green like the back with just a trace of a dull red frontal band, the
breast is of a greyish-violet shade and the subcaudals show more green
and less red than is the case in the mature birds. Individual juveniles
are not too easy to sex but when several are seen together it will be
noticed that the cocks have considerably larger and flatter heads and
tend to show more red on the under tail-coverts. Adult plumage is
acquired with the first complete moult when the birds are from twelve
to fifteen months old.
Variations. --As is to be expected from the limited range of the
species, no valid subspecies have been shown to occur.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate of a male in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 386) is very good. That in Greene (vol. iii, p. 8) probably
portrays a female, but even so the breast is of far too lilac a shade.

I 1 6 A. LENDON AUSTRALIAN PARROTS IN CAPTIVITY
Cayley's plate of a pair in The Emu , vol. xxxvii, pi. 28, although
criticized in an editorial note in regard to the highly coloured female,
is in reality quite good, except that the red caps are depicted extending
too far on to the back.
Field Notes .--I saw this species on several occasions during a recent
visit to Western Australia but unfortunately failed to get a good look
at a mature bird in the wild state. It is an easy species to identify in
the field on account of its very distinctive call-note and because of the
yellowish colour of the rump, which is well seen in flight.
Aviary Notes .--Always a rare bird in captivity and never very popular
with aviculturists on account of its extreme timidity and unsteadiness
in most cases and also on account of the strange shape of the beak,
which is considered ugly by many people but is more than compensated
for, in the writer's opinion, by the gorgeous colouring. Another
advantage is that the bird is not nearly as pugnacious as are most of
the larger Broadtails ; consequently several pairs can be kept together
and the species does reasonably well in a mixed collection.
I first saw this bird alive in 1936 when I visited the collection of
Dr. R. N. Thomson, who was then living at Bankstown, a suburb of
Sydney ; at that time he had a magnificent cock bird which was
seen to great advantage in an aviary with a very long flight. Later
in that year, through the kindness of a colleague in Western Australia,
I was able to obtain ten of these birds, the majority of which were in
immature plumage. I kept a pair for myself and let the Adelaide Zoo
have the rest; they were all housed together and young were bred from
them first in 1938 and on several occasions subsequently.
My personal experiences with the species have, until recently, been
very disappointing. The first cock bird that I had did not survive
very long but his successor, obtained in March, 1937, is still in my
possession. He was mated to my original hen but no breeding was
attempted either in 1937 or 1938. In 1939 a clutch of five eggs was
commenced on 15th October and four young were seen on 11 th
November, the fifth egg proving infertile. All went well for a week
but then the parents apparently ceased to feed the chicks and
immediately started to moult. The hen, who had been in adult
plumage when obtained, died early in 1940 and a replacement only
survived about a month. It was not until August, 1942, that a further
hen could be obtained for my collection. The newcomer seemed to
be even more nervous than the average Pileated, but laid some eggs
the same season. I was away at the time and am not certain if they
were laid in a nest but in any case no results were obtained. In 1943
and 1944 no eggs were laid but in 1945 three eggs were laid from the
perches and were broken. 1946 was another blank year, but in 1947
a clutch of five was laid, mostly on the ground, but two of them
unbroken in a log. For a few days it looked as if the hen would incubate

<bodyText confidence="0.977300813953488" page_id="56311841"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
but then she abandoned the task and proceeded to moult. I felt so
certain that she would never do any good that I would have disposed
of her had a substitute been available. As it transpired, it was fortunate
that I did not do so, for in 1948 a clutch of six eggs was commenced on
13th October and all were laid in the log ! Some days then appeared
to elapse before the hen made up her mind to incubate, but eventually
it was seen that four eggs were fertile. One young bird was seen on
16th November, three the following day, and four by 19th November.
These all flourished and left the nest at daily intervals from 19th
December onwards, all being fine specimens, reasonably quiet and,
I think, one cock and three hens.
The above is the only record of the species having been bred in this
state, other than at the Zoo, and the writer has been awarded the
A.S.S.A. medal for this achievement and also the silver medal of the
Society for the outstanding breeding success of the season. The species
has been bred in Victoria on at least two occasions and also in Sydney
during the 1948 season.
This bird is quite the most typical of all the Broadtails and has no
close relative. Its note is quite unlike that of any other Australian
Parrot and is rather like the noise produced by the wooden gas-rattle
of World War II ; its display is also quite unlike that of any other
Broadtail and consists of the red feathers of the cap being erected in
a striking way whilst the outspread tail is slowly raised towards the
back ; there is none of the tail-wagging and shoulder-squaring of the
typical broadtail display.
(10) Mallee Parrakeet (.Barnardius barnardi)
Synonyms. --Barnard's Parrakeet, Ringneck Parrakeet, Buln-buln.
Distribution .--The inland, drier parts of South Australia, Victoria,
New South Wales, and South Queensland. In the last-named state it
has not been recorded north of Windorah and in South Australia it
is not found west of Spencer's Gulf and the Flinders Range. As its
name implies, it is a bird of the low rainfall, mallee type country.
Description .--A moderately large Broadtail, whose prevailing colour
is green in various shades. The adult male of the typical eastern race
has a broad dark crimson frontal band, light blue cheeks and margins
to the wings, a yellow ring round the back and sides of the neck and
a medium-sized band of the same colour across the lower breast.
The remainder of the body colouring consists of varying shades of
light greenish-blue with the exception of the mantle, which is a dark
blue. The adult female differs in having a smaller rounder head and
a smaller beak ; the body colouring is slightly duller generally and
the dark blue mantle is replaced by a dull green with some blue
shading. The immatures closely resemble the female but all the

markings are less clearly defined and the coloration is duskier in all
respects. The sexes can be distinguished in most cases by the size and
shape of the head and beak. Adult plumage is attained by the first
complete moult of body feathers which occurs when the birds are
between twelve and eighteen months old.
Variations. --Individuals of this species vary very considerably.
The South Australian race ( whitei ) differs in being smaller and having
a much darker head and the yellow abdominal band replaced by
a smaller, less regular band of an orange shade. The aberration
described as crommelinae is merely a bluish variant with the yellow
areas considerably restricted ; birds of this type are not very
uncommon but cannot be regarded as a valid subspecies.
Coloured Plates. --The plate by Roland Green in Mathews (vol. vi,
p. 365) is a very good representation of a male of the dark South
Australian race. That by Goodchild in Seth-Smith (p. 184) is too
pale and not up to that artist's usual high standard. The plate in
Greene (vol. iii, p. 17) gives the bird a most unnatural expression, but
the coloration is reasonably accurate except that the crimson frontal
band is continued around the eyes. Gronvold's plate in Avicultural
Magazine, 1927, p. 145, of the bird originally described by Tavistock
as crommelinae is quite good of one of these occasionally seen bluish
variants.
Field Notes. --I have frequently seen this species in the belt of mallee
country which comes to within forty miles of Adelaide in one place.
They are usually seen in pairs or family parties and, in the former case,
the difference between the sexes can easily be seen when the birds
are in flight.
Aviary Notes. --Hand-reared birds of this species are always in
demand as they frequently make good whistlers ; they are, however,
most unattractive pets as they almost invariably become aggressive
and anxious to bite anyone who takes any notice of them. Like all
its near relatives, this species is unsuitable for a mixed collection on
account of its pugnacity.
When first trapped, Mallee Ringnecks are very wild and frequently
knock themselves and one another about very badly and there seems
invariably to be a high mortality amongst these newly caught birds;
in my early days I quickly lost more than a dozen trapped birds
before obtaining any satisfactory specimens.
I had several birds of this species between 1937 and 1944 without
ever getting them to go to nest. Then, in May, 1944, I acquired an
elderly hen that had bred a considerable number of unattractive
hybrids with various other Broadtail mates in previous years. She
proved to be a temperamental lady, and although terrified of the first
mate I provided for her she was extremely rude to the substitute
provided in July. Notwithstanding her disapproval of her mate, she

went to nest early that season, laying the first of a clutch of five eggs on
14th August and incubating steadily. However, as I had expected,
these eggs were all infertile and I removed them early in September.
By this time the cock had got over some of his early nervousness and
fed the old lady occasionally in an apologetic sort of way and conse-
quently I was more hopeful when a second clutch was commenced on
19th September. On 1 ith October one young bird had hatched, and
a week later there were three large and one small young in the log ;
the little one only survived a few days, however, and a fifth egg
contained a dead embryo. The three larger chicks did well and the
first, a hen, left the log on 14th November and the other two, a pair,
four days later. This success, being the first recorded breeding of the
species in South Australia, gained the A.S.S.A. medal.
The following season (1945) a clutch of four was laid early in Sep-
tember and all were successfully hatched and reared, proving to be
two of each sex. A second clutch was not laid that year. In 1946
a clutch of six was laid early in August, but the cock bird, who had
not looked very well during the winter, was found dead soon after
incubation had started and the eggs proved to be clear and were
thereupon removed. A new mate obtained almost immediately was
very badly received and a period of introduction in the adjoining cage
was necessary. By mid-September the old lady seemed reconciled to
her new mate and laid a further clutch of five by the end of that month ;
however, these were again infertile as were a third clutch laid late in
October.
In 1947 a clutch of three was laid early in September and although
these again proved infertile she was allowed to continue incubating
until late in the month, when four fertile Red-rump eggs, taken in
the bush, were substituted. Two of these hatched three days later,
and a fortnight later three young Blue Bonnets, a little more than half-
grown, were also put in the nest. Quite undeterred, the old lady
proceeded to rear the lot with a minimum of assistance from her
mate. I disposed of her before the 1948 breeding season as she was
becoming progressively more difficult to satisfy as regards a mate, a
characteristic not uncommon in Broadtail hens as they get old, and
especially in those that are inclined to be tame.
The display of this species is identical with that of all the other
Ringnecks and Rosellas, and consists of a squaring of the shoulders
accompanied by a side to side waggling of the outspread tail.

north-western Queensland, and extends northward towards the Gulf
of Carpentaria ; the southern limit of its range is unknown but it is
probably separated by some hundreds of miles from the northernmost
limit of the range of the Mallee Parrakeet. The extent of its range in
an easterly and westerly direction has likewise not been recorded.
Description. --A medium sized Broadtail whose prevailing colouring is
a pale green relieved by blue cheeks and wing margins, pale yellow
neck ring, and a broad band of the same colour on the lower abdomen.
The sexes are very much alike but hens are usually slightly duller and
have a smaller, more rounded head and a smaller beak ; individual
birds, however, are by no means easy to sex with any degree of certainty.
The immatures are only slightly duller than the adults when they
leave the nest, and rather surprisingly show an indistinct orange
coloured frontal band which is lost after a few months, thereafter the
transition to mature plumage is practically imperceptible.
Variations. --None are known to exist.
Coloured Plates. --The plate by Goodchild which originally appeared
in The Ibis , 1902, p. 610, and was reproduced in Avicultural Maga-
zine, 1939, p. 375, is excellent. That by Roland Green in Mathews
(vol. vi, p. 365) is also good but the yellow abdominal band is too
restricted and the back is too dark and too bluish in shade. Cayley's
plate in The Emu (vol. xxix, plate 1) is also quite adequate.
Field Notes. --I have not had the opportunity of seeing this bird in
the field ; Macgillivray has recorded that its habits are similar to those
of B. barnardi as would be expected.
Aviary Notes. ---This species was practically unknown to aviculture
prior to 1939 ; a few birds were kept as pets in Townsville, North
Queensland and it is probable that others were kept in the districts
where the bird is found. Through the kindness of Mr. Oscar Seppelt
I obtained my first example of this species, a young male, in April,
1939. In August of the same year, whilst on holiday in North Queens-
land, I succeeded in obtaining a further pair of these birds in Towns-
ville. These appeared anxious to go to nest as soon as they arrived in
Adelaide and a clutch of five eggs was laid towards the end of Septem-
ber. Of this clutch, one disappeared, two proved infertile, a fourth
contained a fully developed embryo which failed to hatch and the
fifth hatched on 20th October but the young bird only survived three
days. After this initial disappointment, a second clutch of four was
laid in the middle of November and although two of the eggs were
again infertile, the other two hatched early in December. One of
these died a few days later and the other was successfully reared and
left the nest on 9th January, 1940, and proved to be a hen. This was
the first recorded breeding of the species anywhere in the world and
gained the A.S.S.A medal ; it was described in more detail in
Avicultural Magazine, 1940, p. 91. Not satisfied with this record,

the hen laid another clutch of four almost immediately and hatched
them all, but unfortunately three succumbed during a spell of very
hot weather when almost fully fledged, and the sole survivor left the
nest on 19th March.
Thereafter this pair of birds had a remarkably consistent record,
rearing two nests of three young each in 1940, 1941, and 1942. Early
in 1943 the cock succumbed as a result of injuries sustained in a fight
with a pair of Mealy Rosellas into whose cage he had accidentally
found his way, but I was fortunate enough to again be able to obtain
Mr. Seppelt's original cock bird. With this new mate the old hen
again reared three young from the first nest in 1943 but the second
clutch were all infertile. In 1944 three were reared from the first
clutch and two from the second and in 1945 two were reared from the
first and none from the second.
The beginning of the end came early in 1946 when the second mate
died, for although one of her sons, bred in 1944, was obtained the old
hen obviously did not like him much and a solitary egg, laid in Sep-
tember, was infertile. I exchanged her mate for one of her 1942 sons
without any improvement, as two more eggs laid in December were
also clear. In 1947 the first clutch consisted of two eggs, one of which
was surprisingly fertile and hatched on 7th October. This bird was
reared and left the nest on 15th November but was never a very
robust specimen. A second clutch of two was laid but both were clear.
1948 saw what I think is the usual end of an old hen's breeding career,
namely diminishing clutches, most of which are infertile. In this year
a single egg was laid and although incubated steadily, was clear.
I still have the old hen, once again widowed, but I doubt if she will
ever lay again ; after all, thirty-one young successfully reared is not
a bad record ! Of the progeny, a pair reared a single young bird in
the Melbourne Zoo and another owner is reputed to have reared
a fair number of young ; this is, however, unconfirmed.
The original pair were both accomplished whistlers and it was
interesting to note that many of their offspring, particularly the
young cocks, were able to whistle the same tunes !

Pilbara and Geraldton, and extending eastwards to Lake Way, a very
distinct form ( occidentalis) is found which is possibly worthy of the
specific rank bestowed on it by North in 1893.
Description. --A large Broadtail whose prevailing colour is green,
relieved by a black head, blue cheeks, a yellow ring round the back
and sides of the neck and a broad band of the same colour on the
abdomen. The adult male usually has a larger, flatter head and
a larger beak than the female, but this is a species of which certain
individuals are particularly difficult to sex ; in addition, females
usually have the black coloration of the head less intense than the
males. Immatures are duller than adults, particularly as regards
the head, which has an almost brownish hue; the difference in the
size of the beak seems to be more apparent in young birds and makes
them easier to sex than adults. The assumption of full adult plumage
is gradual and is not completed till the bird is over a year old, but it
is not particularly noticeable owing to the relative similarity of adults
and immatures.
Variations. --As already indicated, the form known as occidentalis
is very distinct. It is much smaller than the typical bird, the green is
much paler, though not as light as the shade of green of the Gloncurry,
the head is more of a greyish-black and the cheeks are a paler blue.
I have only seen this bird in life on one occasion, Mr. E. J. L. Hallstrom,
of Sydney, having a specimen in his collection early in 1948. The
Central Australian form, originally described as a subspecies, does not
appear to differ materially from the typical bird. One occasionally
sees an otherwise typical Port Lincoln which exhibits a few red feathers
in the frontal region, but this variation is not constant from any
particular area, as far as can be ascertained.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 373)
is excellent. That in Greene (vol. iii, p. 13) is quite good except for
the cheek patches which are much too light. Goodchild's plate in
Seth-Smith (p. 184) is not up to that artist's usual high standard.
Cayley's plate of the subspecies occidentalis appearing in The Emu
vol. xxix, plate 1, adequately depicts the difference between this and
the typical form.
Field Notes. --I saw this bird in pairs or small parties in the vicinity
of Port Lincoln in January, 1948. In its natural state it appeals to me
as one of the most attractive of all the Australian Parrots, with its
graceful, undulating flight, striking colouring, and pleasing call notes.
Aviary Notes.---A very popular cage bird on the West Coast of South
Australia with a reputation of being an accomplished whistler. Most
specimens seen in captivity have been hand-reared and are conse-
quently fearless and aggressive and not very suitable for breeding
purposes.
I obtained a nice young hen of this species in 1935 and as she was

not too tame, I always regarded her as a potential breeder. For some
time I had considerable trouble in securing a suitable mate for this
bird and it was not until August, 1937, that I secured what appeared
to be a good specimen. Nothing eventuated that season, but the
following year a clutch of four eggs was laid early in September ; of
these, the first was broken and the rest were incubated steadily but
proved to be infertile. Early in 1939 I exchanged the cock for a very
fine specimen which exhibited the almost silvery sheen which is
sometimes noticeable in the green of the upper surface. This season
a clutch of four was commenced on 10th September, all the eggs
proved fertile and duly hatched, young being first seen in the nest on 3rd
October. All four young, two of each sex, were successfully reared,
the first leaving the nest on 9th November and the last on 15th. This
being the first breeding recorded by a member of the A.S.S.A. gained
the medal award, but there is also a doubtful record of an earlier
breeding in South Australia by a person who was not a member of
the Society.
This pair of birds had a gloomy record following their success, as
the hen did not lay in 1940, laid and broke all the eggs in 1941, and
again did not lay in 1942. The hen died early in 1943 and was not
replaced until August of the following year. The newcomer soon
appeared anxious to nest and the first egg of a clutch of five was laid
on 15th September. All the eggs were fertile and young were first
seen on 13th October. All five eventually hatched and were successfully
reared, leaving the nest between 20th and 23rd November. The
following year two clutches of six were laid, but on each occasion the
eggs all disappeared ; in view of a previous similar occurrence, the
cock was suspected of being the culprit. In 1946 clutches of six and
four were laid, but again the eggs gradually disappeared ; this time
it was thought more likely that the hen was to blame. A new pair was
tried in 1947 but they did not go to nest and I did not have any of the
species during the following season.
Port Lincolns usually look very sleek in an aviary and possess quite
musical call notes. Typical birds never seem to possess the " twenty-
eight " call of the next species to be described.

and scarlet frontal band. Adult males are very big birds with huge
beaks of almost Cockatoo size and large flat heads. Adult females are
smaller generally and have smaller, rounder heads and much smaller
beaks; the black of the head is less intense and the red frontal band
is much narrower and sometimes quite inconspicuous. Immatures
resemble the female but are quite easily sexed by the size of the beak.
Their heads, in addition to being dull black, sometimes have a greenish
suffusion, and the frontal bands are quite small and of a dull orange
shade. Adult plumage is not attained till the birds are a little over
a year old ; its assumption is quite a gradual and not a very noticeable
process.
Variations. --Apparently some south-western birds occasionally show
a few yellow feathers mixed with the green of the abdomen, but the
great majority have this region entirely green. In the wheat belt the
birds are smaller, the red frontal band is more variable in extent, and
a yellow abdomen of variable extent is constantly present. This is
the race known as dundasi (= woolundra ) although the bird Mathews
originally figured as dundasi looks to be a typical Port Lincoln,
i.e. zonarius.
Coloured Plates. --Easily accessible plates of this bird are most
uncommon, the only one that the writer is aware of being that in
Greene (vol. iii, p. 37), which is very good as regards colouring but
does not quite convey the bird's massive build. Mathews does not
figure this species at all.
Field Notes. --An unforgettable sight was a small flock of these birds
seen early one morning in an orchard near Bridgetown, Western
Australia, in August, 1948. Another pair were seen investigating a
nesting hollow in a tall eucalyptus and several other small parties were
seen and the typical call note was heard on several occasions. In the
wheat belt the birds look appreciably smaller and are not as attractive
in appearance ; these birds were not heard to call " twenty-eight ".
Aviary Notes .--Like the preceding species, hand-reared specimens
are in considerable demand as pets and are as aggressive as most other
Broadtails similarly treated ; the size of the beak should certainly
engender caution in any would-be fondler ! Trapped birds of this
species are more commonly available than is the case with Port
Lincolns.
I obtained my first specimen, a very fine old male, from a bird-shop
in Sydney in January, 1936, but it was not until May of the following
year that I obtained a young hen, an extremely wild bird that never
really became quiet in captivity. From 1938 onwards this bird used
to spend a considerable amount of time in the log every spring and
feeding and mating were often observed. However, nothing ever
eventuated as far as is known and in 1943 the cock died. A replacement
was not obtained until July, 1944, and that season saw a repetition of

previous performances. In 1945, however, a clutch of four eggs was
commenced on 25th October and three young were seen on 26th
November. These flourished and two of them, both hens, left the nest
on 2nd January, 1946, and the third, imperfectly fledged, three days
later. This bird, a cock, had always been smaller than the others and
was neglected by the parents after leaving the log ; an attempt made
to hand-rear it was not successful. This breeding was the first recorded
for South Australia and gained the A.S.S.A. medal.
In 1946 the same pair repeated their success, although the first egg
of a clutch of four did not appear until 23rd November. All the eggs
were fertile, young were first seen on 16th December, and all had
hatched four days later. Two of this clutch perished during some very
hot weather about Christmastime, but the other two survived and
a cock left the nest on 24th January, 1947, and a hen the following
day. Both old birds died in the autumn of 1947, and although I was
able to secure a new pair they did not attempt to breed that year
and I disposed of them before the next breeding season.
Twenty-eights were bred in the Adelaide Zoo in 1946, but I am
not aware of any other success anywhere else in Australia.

THE MINIVETS OF INDIA
By W. Griffiths
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998461452380953" page_id="56311850"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
India has many beautiful birds of which she is very proud. In spite
of her majestic Peacock, her iridescent Sunbirds and other avian gems,
she feels most proud of her Minivets--the Scarlet Minivet (Pericrocotus
speciosus ) taking first place.
So elated are the Indians with these beautiful birds that the names
of Raja Lai and Peela Ranee given them tend to prove the authen-
ticity of my statement (Raja Lai and Peela Ranee meaning Red King
and Yellow Queen respectively). These names aptly suit, the male
being robed in glossy black and rich scarlet whilst his mate is frocked
in ashy grey and yellow.
A flock of about thirty of these birds, flitting about the upper
terraces of high trees in search of insects and occasionally darting out
to catch them on the wing, is surely a sight never to be forgotten.
These birds are rarely brought to the bird markets of Calcutta and
I remember, very clearly, the excitement I felt when I first beheld
a pair for sale. So eager was I to purchase them that, contrary to usual
procedure when purchasing, I even paid the price asked, to find later
that I could have obtained same for less than a quarter of that amount.
Taking them home I let the pair into one of my aviaries, and shortly
after, I visualized a nest, four or six eggs and even youngsters. Alas !
They only survived three days and away went my already built
castles. These birds, coming from the Himalayas, led me to assume
that the terrific Bengal heat was far too severe for them.
A few months later I saw in the same shop an Orange Minivet
(P. jlammeus )--a solitary male--another beautiful bird indeed and
not unlike the foregoing save that instead of a scarlet waistcoat he
had an orange-red one. The urge to procure it for my collection was
very strong but the loss of my Scarlet pair led me to decide otherwise.
There is another species, the Short-billed Minivet (P. brevirostris),
but I never saw any find their way into the bird markets. A friend of
mine, however, living up in the hills informed me that he had a pair
which he purchased from a Nepalese bird-catcher.
The method they adopt in catching birds is quite an ingenious one.
They get a long thin bamboo, little thicker than the type used by
boys for pea-shooters, or perhaps two or three joined together. At
the top they lash a leafy twig which is smeared with a very sticky
substance. The trapper lies concealed at the foot of a tree with the
bamboo already in position between the branches. The unsuspecting
birds, busy in their search for insects, are unaware of the moving twig
coming nearer them. When close enough, the trapper directs the
bamboo towards the bird, and, before the poor thing knows what has
happened, it is securely stuck to the twig. The more it flutters the

greater the difficulties it gets into, and, very soon, it is powerless. The
bamboo is lowered and the bird retrieved--a very painful procedure
I should imagine. The glue is then removed from the feathers with
a special oil. Birds caught in this way show traces of their means of
capture, as the gluey substance can never be properly and totally
removed by the trapper. The insistent pruning of the feathers by the
birds also tend to prove this.
Well the pair my friend purchased was soon safely installed in his
aviary, but the following morning he found the female lying dead on
the floor. He immediately wanted to release the male but on second
thoughts did not, and later never regretted his decision. He raved
about its beauty and this is understandable, it being not unlike P.
speciosus , except that it had more black in the tail and the wings had
a lovely scarlet band across them. It lived on insectivorous food and
became finger tame, but he complained of one peculiarity. Whenever
there was a downpour of rain the bird never bothered to take shelter,
like other birds did, and would soon look a very wretched, pitiable,
and miserable object.
There are two other Minivets found in India and these are really
very common. The Small or Little Minivet (P. peregrinus ), found mostly
in the plains, is the commonest and naturally not appreciated like the
preceding. However, he is a handsome, perky little fellow, smaller
than the others already mentioned. He is very much like the Scarlet
Minivet except that he has grey on the back and the scarlet is replaced
by orange-crimson. The female, a paler edition of the male, has mostly
yellow instead of orange-crimson. They go about in small flocks and
are often seen in groves and gardens searching for insects, small
moths, and their larva.
The other little commoner is the White-bellied Minivet (P. erythro-
pygius ). With a black and white tail and white under parts and with
rump and breast of orange-red the male looks almost as handsome as
his foregoing cousins. The female of this species is very plain, with dark
brown replacing the black, rump as in the male, and rest of lower
plumage white. Both the Small and White-bellied Minivets are very
cheap and as such not worthwhile keeping, the cost of feeding these
birds being far beyond the pleasure derived from their beauty--their
only recommendation.
It will surely be a great day for me if and when, any of these
gorgeous Indian Minivets are seen in the bird-shops of London,
especially when I may once again possess a pair of Scarlet Minivets--
a beautiful Red King and a fine Yellow Queen.

Goose, Chen hyperborea hyperborea , and a female Canada Goose, Branta
canadensis, occurred on the game farm of Jack Miles of Denver,
Colorado. He has a small band of pinioned Canada Geese and one
crippled, male Snow Goose. In 1942, and the following spring, the
Snow Goose followed a Canada Goose and attempted to mate,
apparently without success. His attentions continued in the next
two years, and eggs were laid both seasons, but they did not hatch.
In 1946, four eggs were laid, and in due time three young appeared,
two of which were raised. These two young, a trifle larger than the
Snow Goose, have nearly white heads, a flecking of white upon the
neck, and their underparts are whiter than in Canada Geese."
There is a good photograph of one of the hybrids.
The Edinburgh #oo.
The Annual Report of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland
for the year ending 31st March, 1949, gives the following results :--
" Four pairs of King Penguins had eggs, but only one hatched, and
the chick has been reared and is now full-grown. Two pairs of
Gentu Penguins also nested. One pair hatched and reared two chicks,
but the other pair deserted their eggs which were then placed in an
incubator. One egg was hatched, but though the keeper made every
effort to rear it by hand, it died when a week old. Night Herons and
Canada Geese were hatched and reared, and for the first time in the
Park a pair of Swans nested and hatched cygnets, two of which were
reared. A pair of Tawny Owls nested and hatched a chick, but failed
to rear it."
The Tasmanian Masked Owl bred in Victoria.
David Fleay gives a full account of his success, and a series of
photographs in the Emu, 1949, 169-176.
Gould described this species, Tyto castanops, as the largest " Barn
Owl " in the world, and Fleay says that that is exactly what it is.
In March, 1946, Fleay put a pair in a secluded bush aviary in
Healesville Sanctuary. Eggs were laid on 20th and 22nd July, and
on 23rd August, thirty-five days after the laying of the first egg, a single
owlet was hatched. It throve amazingly, and at the age of nine
weeks made its first nocturnal excursion away from the hollow, and
thereafter became increasingly venturesome. The female parent

then laid the first egg of a clutch of four on 2nd October, but the
owlet continually upset its mother by wing exercises, etc, and eventually
all the eggs were broken. The parents were transferred to another
aviary, and by mid-November, 1946, the female had laid a clutch
of three eggs. These were removed for expert examination. In the
late summer (February-March) of 1947, one young one was hatched
and reared--a female, whereas the first had been a male. During
1948, two pairs of eggs were laid, but proved to be infertile--due
to unsuitable housing.
Fleay does not claim his as a first success, but writes : "In the
absence of records to the contrary, it appears that the Tasmanian
Masked Owl was first bred in captivity by Miss Audrey Lee in a
Launceston, Tasmania, collection in 1945. Unfortunately, however,
as far as I know, there is no written compilation of the activities of
the birds at that time. 55
Twenty-one Splendids bred in California.
David West writes : "I certainly do enjoy your Magazine ! All
plans are dropped when it arrives. Breeding results have really only
been fair this year. The only outstanding success was with the
Scarlet-chested--three pairs have raised no fewer than 21 young, every
one a beauty. Six Turquoisines, five Bourkes, two Elegants, and six-
teen Blue Rosellas (from three pairs) were also raised ; but only one
Princess Alexandra, though it is exceptionally large and colourful.
Several other species, such as Stanley, Red Rosella, Barnard's, Plum-
headed, Many-coloured, and Hooded failed me. The Scarlet-chested,
of course, are a wonderful balm ! 55

Joseph Bruyneel writes : " The breeding season has not been very
successful, but I have young of Bourke's, Elegant, Blue-winged, Red-
rumped, Stanley, Mealy Rosella, Barnard's, Crimson-winged, Barra-
band's, Princess, Masked Lovebird, blue ; and others that still brood.
I did expect to have many more, but the weather has not been favour-
able. Recent hybrids bred are Crimson-winged X King, Crimson-
winged X Rock Pebbler, and Purple-capped Lory X Red-collared
Lorikeet.
I would be very pleased to hear of a pair of Splendids and a Derbyan

very soon after (1834) at Lord Derby's menagerie at Knowsley in
England. The birds bred regularly for many years in a number of zoos
and private collections and became fairly common in Europe, but
it was scarce again after 1900 and eventually disappeared entirely.
Intelligent management and planning could have kept the species
going for ever. The last specimen in Europe lived in my collection at
Cleres until 1940, when it vanished at the time of the invasion of
France. It had come from the late F. E. Blaauw's collection in Holland,
where it had been reared forty-two years before. Blaauw had a great
deal of experience with the species and was the last breeder to rear
it successfully. He reports as follows in the Ibis, 1904, p. 68 :
" The next birds to lay eggs in 1903 were a pair of Sandwich Island
Geese (,Neochen sandvicensis), a species which has become extremely rare
in Europe of late years. These birds are kept at Gooilust in a small
grass-grown enclosure, with plenty of shrubs and a wooden shed in it.
As they are not happy in the frost and snow, I have them shut up in
the shed every night after winter has set in. One good result of this
arrangement is that the birds usually build a nest in the hay which
covers the floor, and this makes it possible to protect them and their
eggs from the cold weather that often prevails at the early season
when they are accustomed to lay.
" Last February five eggs were laid. These were all hatched, and
during the whole time of incubation the male was constantly on the
watch beside the female, running with great fury at everyone who
came near.
" The chicks are of a dark olive-green, darker on the head and
back and whitish on the under parts. The tips of the wings are nearly
white, the bill and legs black.
" These birds grow very quickly, so that at the age of about nine
weeks the wings have to be cut to prevent them from flying away.
" The immature dress is very much like that of the adults, but the
general tone is more grey than yellow, and all the black or brown
markings are less clearly defined. The curious spiral ridges in the neck-
feathering are already visible in the young bird. The yellow of the
neck is greyish black, and is darker in the young males, so far as my
experience goes.
" At the end of July the young birds began to moult, and in about
six weeks had acquired the adult plumage, the flight- and tail-feathers
being retained, as in other young waterfowl, until the following year.

" Of this particular brood of five, I had the misfortune to lose three
when they were only half-grown. A very cold night seems to have
been the cause of their death."
Hawaiian Geese require the same treatment as the majority of other
Geese. In Europe the only difficulties were their limited resistance
to cold winters, their early laying, and the bad temper of the ganders ;
some were inclined suddenly to attack their mate, even after years of
peaceful life, and to kill her. Otherwise they were easy to keep and to
breed. Hawaiian Geese are quarrelsome, and it is necessary to separate
each adult pair in a pen large enough never to become overgrazed.
As with all Geese, the first condition of success is an abundance of
grazing. The birds feed mostly on grass to which they must have
free access throughout the year. It is advisable to surround the pen
with a thick live hedge to ensure privacy and shelter, and to plant
a few clumps of shrubs and small trees for shade. There should be
sufficient water for free swimming and mating, a pool 6 by io feet
being a minimum. The old Hawaiian gander at Cleres swam freely
on the ponds at times. If rain and wind are strong, an open shelter is
useful. The Geese should be pinioned. Besides grass and various other
green foods, a daily ration of grain and rich protein mash are all they
need.
The Hawaiian Geese will take care of their goslings, but if any
predators are around it is safer to incubate the eggs under a broody
hen (or in an incubator) and to rear the young in safe coops with
a sufficient run attached--which is moved as often as necessary on a
good, fresh lawn, usually three or four times a day. When the young
are two weeks old, they are let out during the day on good grass,
under constant watching if any enemy is likely to attack them. Besides
grass, lettuce, and other greens, soaked biscuit and custard (egg and
milk cooked together) with plenty of duckweed, if available, is the
best diet.
To-day Hawaiian Geese have been reduced to perhaps less than
fifty individuals in their native island, where they live in a more or
less protected state. The local authorities are trying to save them and
they are making plans for their propagation in captivity and the
eventual restocking on their old territory. They are found on the
island of Hawaii only.
An excellent study of the distribution and reduction in numbers of
the Hawaiian Goose by Paul H. Baldwin, has appeared in The Condor ,
vol. 47, Jan., 1945, pp. 27-37. From some 25,000 birds probably
existing in the early years of this century, they had dwindled
down to less than 100. Another sad chapter of the story of the destruc-
tion of wild life during the twentieth century.

NOTES ON TWO JAYS

<bodyText confidence="0.999203761904762" page_id="56311856"  page_num="132" year="" vol="">
Of all the birds I know, the Corvids are my favourites (although the
Ducks and Pigeons run them close), and of the Corvida the Jay takes
top place in my esteem. He is not, I think, quite so intelligent as the
true Grows ( Corvus ) and Magpies (Pica), and not such a good homer
if allowed his liberty, but being far less aggressive to other birds and
when not alarmed far less noisy, he is to be preferred as an aviary
bird. I am only too well aware that I am almost alone in this opinion
of him, thanks in some measure to the damage he does in the garden
(damage that would be as a rule laughingly dismissed if committed
by some favoured species), but chiefly to exaggerated and wilfully
misleading propaganda put out by certain of the game-preserving (?)
fraternity and those bird-lovers who love only the smaller species.
People who themselves will kill for pleasure some of the loveliest
birds in the world (Pheasants and Ducks) talk about " the wicked
black heart " that beats beneath the gay plumage of the Jay, because j
he kills a few small birds 5 nestlings to feed his young when they are
crying for food. The Jay's harsh alarm notes may have helped his
unpopularity. " What ! Is the Jay more precious than the Lark
because his feathers are more beautiful ? " wrote the Bard of Avon ;
and from Shakespeare to the modern authors I have searched in vain
for one kindly reference to the Jay in literature, unless W. H. Hudson's
remarks on his vivacity or La Fontaine's " proudly as a Jay on a tree "
comes into this category.
Prior to 1940, when I was called up, I had kept several Jays at
different times, but had not achieved my ambition of owning a
breeding pair. Luckily I was finally demobbed in mid-June, so was
able to go straight ahead with my plans for obtaining them. I hand-
reared four unrelated young Jays, hoping to have at least one pair
among them. As so often happens, things did not go according to
plan. When only two months old one of the youngsters got out and
was promptly shot by a neighbour--the fate of so many tame birds
when allowed their liberty. One of the remaining three had always
been nervous and timid, and despite the example of its comrades,
became more so as it matured. To release it was a kindness to all
parties, and I had no misgivings in so doing, as the bird would
obviously " go wild " almost immediately, and as that autumn
(1946) there was a bumper crop of acorns there was no fear of it
going short of food whilst " finding its feet By October the other
two were beautiful birds, differing much in appearance, one having
the crown thickly streaked and a strong grey tinge on mantle and
breast, and the other a lightly streaked crown and a bright reddish-
pink tinge on the fawn parts of the plumage. These differences in

plumage shade appear to be individual rather than sexual or racial,
as commonly all the young in a nest will show a decidedly pinkish
or greyish tone--noticeable even in the " foxy " juvenile plumage--
whilst in the next nest in the same wood birds of the opposite extreme
may be found. From this perceptible colour difference I fell into the
habit of calling these birds " P 55 and " G " in my notebook, and will
do so in this article for convenience.
Since G commonly greeted me with the soft chirruping notes that
I thought to be indicative of the female sex, I presumed it to be a hen,
and as P was slightly smaller in size and with a finer head and bill,
I imagined that both were of the same sex. G was at first dominant
to P, but by the late Autumn this state of affairs had been reversed
without any obvious fighting having taken place. Except where
breeding birds are concerned a captive Jay that is subordinate to its
companion suffers little if at all. The dominant one threatens it with
snapping bill and makes it give precedence at bath or food dish, but
does not bully it or rob it of food that it has in its bill, nor does sub-
missive behaviour on one bird's part inflame the other's anger and
incite it to indulge in the type of murderous persecution so often
shown by Doves and Pheasants in such circumstances.
In the Spring of 1947 the two Jays made no attempt to nest. True
on one occasion P flew down, picked up a stick (how my heart
fluttered !) and dropped it again. Three times--but on isolated
occasions--I saw P feed G, and once when Gwent into the submissive (?)
posture with raised rump and quivered wings--on 17th May--P
mounted her and they overbalanced and fell off the perch together,
but they gave no signs of being paired, and when later on P started using
the wing-quivering posture towards me I felt quite sure they were
both hens.
My attempts to purchase a tame cock Jay met with some lack of
success. One well-known fancier sent me a letter dilating on the
tameness and accomplishments of a bird in his possession. These
eulogies took up a page, and I expected that the next page would
inform me that the bird could not be parted with; instead it informed
me that it could not be parted with for less than #10 ! I declined
this generous offer, but eventually I had spent nearly #10 one way
and another--including the purchase of two birds which died almost
on arrival--before finally I had two more Jays, both of which were
in poor condition, with frayed and broken plumage (this last perhaps
caused in some degree by the train journey) and of doubtful sex.
One of them seemed an obvious hen, at first greeting every Jay that
settled near it and every person entering the aviary with a most
exaggerated version of the wing-quivering posture, body and head
crouching (but well up on legs), tail and rump raised and quivered,
and wings arched into bright quivering fans on either side of it. As it

improved in condition, however, it ceased this behaviour. The other
bird was a rather large specimen, but was nervous, and would not
feed from the hand. This bird I called R in my notebook, and the
other new one W. W was at first subordinate--after being worsted
in its first deliberate quarrels with them--to all the others. Later,
however, R was badly injured by a box which fell on top of him.
He was blind and helpless for some days, during which I feared he
would die, but he eventually made a slow recovery, although having
lost the sight of one eye. (Incidentally, at the time of writing, although
recovered otherwise, he is still blind in one eye, but manages not only
to get about without any loss of dexterity and to catch morsels thrown
to him, but also to dominate his companion.) At the same time, G in
some unexplained manner injured one of her wings. It was not
broken, but completely incapable of beating, and after a few days the
flesh became swollen and discoloured. W took advantage of these
misfortunes to become dominant over both of the injured birds, but
did not persecute them in any way. On the 15th February I saw
P feed G (who was still unable to fly) five times in about twenty
minutes, each time flying deliberately to her. She did not solicit
this feeding, and seemed to accept it with some reluctance. G's
wing suddenly started to mend. On the 18th she attempted to fly--
without much success, but showing that it no longer pained her to
try, and by the 21st she was flying freely, but a little lopsidedly, about
the aviary. By the 7th March G could fly almost as well as ever,
and P was feeding her constantly and hopping round her in the display
posture (feathers of rump, flanks, and lower back erect, mantle and
upper breast flat, crest usually raised), uttering a peculiar note--\0x25A0
a sort of prolonged throaty, rasping hiss, that I had only heard pre-
viously from the (presumed) male of a nesting wild pair. I still,
however, feared the birds might be two hens, especially as often
G would hop up to P with food in her bill--not held in the gullet as
were P's offerings--and give it to P who would accept it in the wing-
quivering crouching posture, into which G would also fall as she
offered it or immediately after. Sometimes the morsel would be
handed back and forth several times, as was never the case when
P gave food to G in the more usual way. By 20th March G had
commenced to harry R and W, so they were removed to an adjoining
aviary. P never seemed very jealous of them. His jealousy was
focused on myself, and he commenced to attack me. He was, and is,
essentially of a more nervous and timid disposition than G, but having
screwed up his courage and found that he could attack with impunity
he thereafter did so constantly. My giving tit-bits through the wires
to R and W annoyed him intensely, and feeding G made him still
more furious. I deliberately refrained from the latter, not wishing
to risk anything that might arouse abnormal sexual behaviour in her.

Daily P's anger at my presence in the aviary and his persistent
feeding of G increased in intensity, as did my excitement and im-
patience, and then at last, on 27th March, I saw G tug several times
at the end of the branch she was perched on and then detach and drop
a twig, and knew that nest-building would soon be under way. On
the following day G picked up and dropped several sticks. When
I mowed the lawn on that day both birds as usual fell into a state of
excitement at the sound of the mower, and went into the display
attitude. After some moments P suddenly dashed at G and chased
her madly about the aviary. The speed at which they flew--" spring-
boarding " off the wire at either end, dodging and twisting--was
almost incredible, and how neither bird injured itself by striking one of
the many perches scarcely less so. The speed of movement was too
much to see what finally occurred, but the affair ended with a most
furious fight, the birds, with crests fully erect, springing up at one
another like game-cocks and falling to the ground interlocked,
screaming and tearing feathers from each other. I separated them,
and the next moment the cock was feeding the hen in the most loving
manner as though nothing had happened. Thereafter these chases--
often ending in a fight--took place several times. They were certainly
not forcible attempts at coition, which is the usual explanation given of
similar chases among passerine birds. So far as I could see, the
emotion involved was primarily aggressive. In every case P would
"work himself" into a state of intense aggressive excitement, and,
failing to expel me if I was in the aviary in spite of his attacks or to
get at me if I was outside, would suddenly turn on his mate. Stronger
evidence for the idea that aggressiveness, which balked of its proper
object just had to have an outlet, was the main cause of these attacks
was that later when--during the period that she was broody--G
became dominant over P, she frequently chased and finally fought with
him in precisely the same manner. In every case this occurred when
she had become enraged in her vain efforts to reach and attack the
Jays in the adjoining aviary, and finally turned on her mate for
emotional relief.
By the 4th April both birds were carrying sticks frequently, but
they did not favour the thickets of conifer branches I had contrived
for them--perhaps because they were not high enough, as I had
hoped to force them to nest where I could look at the nest from above
or on a level with it--and persistently carried them to a beam that
runs along the top ridge of the aviary about six inches below the wire
at its highest point, where they soon fell to the ground. Weakly
capitulating, I fixed up some branches high up alongside the top
beam, and tied some conifer boughs to the wire above on the outside,
to provide some shelter both from the weather and those two scourges
of the aviculturist, the domestic cat and Tawny Owl. P at once

investigated with every sign of excitement and pleasure, and G did
likewise, but after much hesitation. Building started the following
day, but for about a week little visible progress was made. From
what I saw--and I spent much time watching them unobserved from
a window overlooking the aviary--I think it safe to say that for every
ten sticks they carried up to the nest they knocked down eight and
pulled out one. Both sexes took sticks to the nest in about equal
numbers, but in the early stages G spent more time on the nest-site
than her mate, so was probably doing most of the serious work. She
had the habit--never observed in her mate--of pulling out and dis-
carding any stick which hung awkwardly downwards or jutted out , of
the nest, even going so far as to scramble about upside down below the
nest whilst thus engaged. The common effect of one of these laudable
efforts at tidiness was to rupture the framework, cause several more
sticks to be dislodged, and undo in a few moments the work of several
hours. By the nth April a " skeleton framework " of two sides of the
nest had been formed. Being unable to find the source of the roots
used by wild Jays for their nests, I obtained coconut fibre by dis-
embowelling an armchair, and this was readily accepted by the birds.
They never took a beakful of fibre at one mouthful, but drew out one
strand at a time, holding it in the back of the bill whilst pulling out and
disentangling the next, and so on, until they had as much as they
could carry. To my surprise the cock bird took a rather greater
share in gathering fibre and lining the nest than the hen. I still
at this time feared the birds might be two hens, and this behaviour
rather worried me, especially in view of the frequent fights and the
fact that I had never seen any attempt at coition on P's part, even
when G appeared to be obviously soliciting him.
By the 15th April a rather frail nest with a very frail lace-like
tracery of fibre lining it had materialized. By the 20th the lining was
much thicker than that usual in a wild Jay's nest. That evening G
was looking very heavy. She attacked her mate several times--after
trying to get at the hated birds next door--but finally he turned on
her and chased her, and she flew awkwardly, and became very puffed
and distressed. Next day she went on the nest at dawn, and came off
at 0650 hours without having laid. At seven she went on again,
and came off for a few minutes at 0740 hours, leaving an egg in the nest.
I must here digress for a moment to warn those who are about to
put this article down in disgust as just another success story, that such
is far from being the case. Disaster circles above, like a patient,
relentless Kite, and at the appropriate moment stoops very effectively,
as those who read on will learn.
To continue. Four more eggs were laid at daily intervals.
G remained on the nest--except for brief intervals of a few moments
to obtain drink and exercise--from the first day, but I suspect that

actual incubation did not start until the third egg was laid. P fed
her on the nest, but was particularly solicitous in feeding her when
she came off. The manner in which he did this, if ever I was present,
strongly suggested that he was jealous of me as a rival for his mate's
attention. Certainly any attempt on my part to feed her by hand
was furiously resented by him. On the morning of the 9th May three
of the eggs were chipped, and at midday the young had hatched.
G came off the nest, and both she and her mate fed themselves, but
did not attempt to feed the young. I then offered mealworms, and
G at once came off again, ate them, and then went back and fed the
young, taking a lot of time about it, and in the intervals uttering a soft,
inexpressibly tender crooning note. The other two eggs hatched
on the 1 oth and 11 th respectively. On the latter date I examined
one of the young ones and it looked very poorly. Subsequent tests
suggested that the old birds were only feeding insects--which had not
been supplied in sufficient quantity for a sole diet. Then began a time
of vain toil. At dawn I went out and sawed down caterpillar infested
boughs to fling into the aviary. After work I dug out ants' nests, and
after dark I visited all the street lamps within a mile or two of my
home to collect the cockchafers that blundered and crashed about
them. On the 12th the male bird removed a dead (?) young one
from the nest, and pulled it to pieces (the pulling to pieces of any
object lending itself to such treatment being a habit apparently
universal in Jays, as in children and monkeys). The young bird's
stomach was intact, and contained several undigested caterpillars and
a piece of mealworm. After about a week the parents gave soft food
freely to the young, and I thought all was well. Two of the young ones,
however, were weak and puny, and died at about ten days old. I was,
however, still optimistic. The remaining two young looked fat and
healthy, and wild Jays very frequently rear only two young ones,
and hardly ever the complete brood, which is usually five when first
hatched. The conduct of the parents throughout was full of interest.
At first P gave the food to G, and she fed the young, but after the first
few days he would only give her a portion of the food in his gullet, and
they would feed the young together. On at least two occasions he
refused to give her any, inserted his head beneath her, and fed the
young himself, and she was forced to content herself with helping to
remove the faeces. Both birds were extraordinarily keen on this.
They watched with tense expectancy, and the moment a young one
started to defecate one or other of its parents would eagerly seize and
swallow the faeces. These were carried in the gullet, often for upwards
of ten minutes, and subsequently disgorged and placed carefully on
some perch or ledge, never dropped haphazard on the ground. I had
often wondered why the Corvid# so seldom rear all the young they
hatch. The Grow usually lays three or four eggs, the Jay five, and the

Magpie six, yet in my experience from one to three for the Grow and
from two to four for Jay and Magpie is the usual number reared.
The behaviour of my Jays, if typical, strongly suggests that the weaker
are " encouraged 55 to waste away by a system of (biologically)
deliberate neglect. If the young one did not instantly swallow when
fed the food was at once removed and given to another. Commonly
the parent would utter the food call, up would stretch the gaping
mouths on the wavering necks, callously as a drill sergeant watching
a squad present arms, she would watch the heads gradually waver and
sink, and finally the last two still managing to gape would alone be fed.
The two weaklings faded away and died, but the other two seemed
healthy enough and--fool that I was--I rejoiced, thinking them
past the danger stage, and my ambition at last achieved. Then
came the pay-off! The primaries, secondaries, and rectrices of the
young birds grew stunted and aborted. They were horrible to see,
twisted, swollen, growing at odd impossible angles, and when the
young left the nest at 18 days old they became completely earth-
bound. When this happened their mother ceased to feed them, and
soon ceased to care for them in any way, but their father still fed them
assiduously. Their food, apart from insects, had consisted chiefly of
cooked Golden Pheasants' eggs, and on consultation with a friend,
we came to the conclusion that probably the " B " group of vitamins
(inter alia) were insufficiently represented in the food. Accordingly,
Bemax and Galci were added to the soft food, and every endeavour
made to give the young birds a varied diet. However, to cut a long
and sad story short one of the young ones went from bad to worse
from a plumage point of view, and its continual vain attempts to fly
were painful to behold, and when it seemed certain that it would
not improve and its life was obviously one of frustration and misery
I killed it, feeling rather lower morally than the average murderer
who at least does not destroy those he has fed and cherished. The other
young one, however, showed vast improvement. When the old
broken, aborted feathers were removed many normal, or nearly
normal, ones grew in their place. Some of them are far from perfect,
and some a little out of alignment, but it must be a great strain for a
young passerine to have to grow two lots of quill feathers within a few
months of leaving the nest. He cannot compare with his parents,
but he would " pass in a crowd He was at first very wild, but is
now beginning to " take to " me although he will not yet feed from
the hand. I have high hopes that his first full moult next summer
will result in a great improvement. At the moment he is still in
the midst of his first moult (4th September, 1948), and comparison
with his parents who are now in perfect new plumage hardly does
him justice. I like him and rejoice in his triumph over his early
misfortunes, and if I sometimes feel as Sid did of Tom Sawyer, that

Postscript .--Checking the proofs of this article at the present date
(26th April, 1949), some further remarks seem appropriate. The
young bird mentioned greatly improved but, owing chiefly to the little
time I was able to devote to it, did not become tame so I finally
liberated it, when it soon disappeared. Of the two Jays purchased
as cock W. moulted out into a nice bird but R., although much
improved otherwise, again grew primaries and tail with defective
webbing. The old pair P. and G. again have eggs and I am hoping
for better luck this year.

SURVIVAL OF THE NOTORNIS

(Received from the Official Press Department of the High Com-
missioner of New Zealand in London)
The danger of the extermination of the Notornis, New Zealand's rare
bird recently rediscovered in the Lake Te Anau area of the South
Island, is emphasized in a statement by the Minister of Internal
Affairs (the Hon. W. E. Parry). The Notornis, he says, is very
sensitive to disturbance, and on that account every care should be
taken to prevent the colony from being molested. Mr. Parry says
that according to the preliminary report of Dr. R. A. Falla, director
of the Dominion Museum, who visited the Te Anau area, the Notornis
colony recently discovered by Dr. Orbell, could not be regarded as
flourishing. There is no evidence to show that the present population
is increasing, while the low rate of reproduction of apparently one
egg, one chick, to each breeding pair, suggests that the colony is
precariously stable at a level determined by the food available and
predatory pressure. Evidence of between ten to twenty nesting pairs
was seen by the party, and it was thought probable that there might
be up to a hundred birds. Dr. Falla described the eggs as dull cream
with brown spots and faint mauve blotches. The chicks are clothed
in jet black down, have a black bill, large purple-brown feet, and
conspicuous wing spurs. One observer's description of the Notornis
itself is that it has remarkably vivid plumage in shades of indigo,
peacock blue, and olive. So far as could be seen, the Notornis lived
on a diet of snowgrass supplemented with grass seed. The sound
made by the Notornis to attract its chick is similar to the clucking of
a domestic hen. Mr. Parry says the observations of Dr. Falla and his
party represent the first scientific study of the living Notornis ever
made, and full credit should be given to Dr. Orbell for his painstaking
research over many years.

During the twenty-five years I have seriously collected records of
birds bred in captivity I have come across many curious reports, both
real and imaginary.
Many years ago I heard a somewhat garbled but, as it later tran-
spired, substantially accurate account of a breeding experiment with
Grey Parrots that had been made in America some years before.
At the time it struck me as being so improbable that I did not
attach much importance to it and more or less graded it in the " It
couldn't happen here " class.
I was, therefore, considerably surprised when some years later I read
an account of the event by the breeder himself in Aviculture , 1930,
pp. 255^7. As Parrots are of interest to a great many readers I am
venturing to reproduce the more pertinent parts of the article.

friend's cow barn in Jersey. Three years later sixty-seven birds had
been added to the original number placed in this loft and eleven
skeletons were found. The birds never saw a human being after being
placed in their loft, consequently no pictures were taken. The experi-
ment was really quite novel and one that I do not think should be
printed at this time because of the lack of detail that bird lovers will
want to know about.
The entire loft was lined with f inch wire netting to keep out the
rats and to allow climbing around. There was a continuous water
supply, regulated so that two or three porcelain dishes were kept filled,
and the attendant saw to it that there was a slight overflow from these
raised dishes to keep the four of five inches of sawdust that was scattered
over the floor damp and cause some rotting.
The nests were hung from the ceiling on hay wire wrapped around
small branches ; some were barrels cut in half, partially filled with
peat moss and sawdust ; others were rotten logs hung vertically, and
some horizontally. Soap boxes were also nailed to the wall, all the
same " pigeon style ". All of the entrances to the nests, and in fact
a great many of the nests, were covered with Florida moss, hay, etc.,
in order to give the birds more seclusion. Ordinary chicken hoppers
were used which had a connection from the outside to put in hemp,
sunflower, millet, canary, and clover grass seed. The sawdust on the
floor being damp, much of the wasted seed sprouted and was readily
eaten by both the old and young.

A. A. PRESTWICH-AN EXPERIMENT IN BREEDING GREY PARROTS 141
In one end of the loft was a half-inch hardware square netting
basket and under it a box of bran. Occasionally a calf's head was
thrown in and while I never saw the Parrots eat any of the fresh or
decayed meat, nevertheless they relished the maggots which dropped
from the basket. This loft being in a dairy barn made it very con-
venient for the attendant occasionally to slip in by way of the trap-
door pans of sour milk or cottage cheese. I put in a chute, the entrance
of which was on the outside, which went down to the centre of the
room. Mixed feed was thrown daily down this chute. The reason for
this was twofold.
First, because so many birds, as you know, will not clear away the
shells at the hoppers ; and second, to give the birds some exercise
when hungry."
To. say the least, the experiment seems a little unusual and open to
considerable suspicion but for the fact that in later years Gilbert Lee
was extraordinarily successful in breeding Grey Parrots, but on more
orthodox lines.
In 1933 a single young one was reared, partly by hand ; and in
1934 a brood of four was fully reared by the parents alone. During
the following five or six years Mr. and Mrs. Lee consistently reared
more and more as they were able to get pairs mated. Mr. Lee died in
1941, but Mrs. Lee continued to breed Greys and has now, I believe,
bred them to the fourth generation.

Once again this year the President extended his customary hospitality
to those members who, with their friends, wished to take advantage
of the opportunity of inspecting his collection at his beautiful country
home.
It is hoped that those familiar with Foxwarren Park will pardon a
brief topographical preface for the information of the numerous
recruits, many of whom reside abroad, who have recently joined the
Society, and who may not yet have had the pleasure of visiting Fox-
warren. The estate lies about twenty miles south-west of London on the
Portsmouth road, which is still, despite modern encroachments,
probably the most beautiful highway out of the Metropolis. No
railway has as yet been built within some miles of the Park, and the
country around is still unspoiled, and the visitors had an ample
opportunity of appreciating its beauty during the latter part of the
drive from London on the coach, which the President generously
provided. Those geologically or botanically minded will doubtless
be able to form a mental picture of the surroundings if they call to
mind a typical Bagshot Beds landscape, consisting of undulations of
a light and sandy soil, ideal for aviculture because of its dryness, the
typical vegetation of which comprises bracken, heather, birch, and
pine. The house itself surmounts a ridge overlooking on the south
the sharp slope well-known to the erstwhile cyclists of the " Ripley
Road 55 as Red Hill, beyond which stretch commons, woods, and
fields to the range of the North Downs, some four or five miles away,
whilst to the north the agricultural portion of the estate (for our
President's interests comprise farming and a considerable Jersey herd),
slopes gently down to the River Wey, seen as a shimmering ribbon
in the distance.
In this landscape, ideal in soil and situation, the main group of
aviaries has been constructed, surrounded by a sheltering screen of
larches. Two long shelters, substantially weather-boarded and roofed
with ruberoid, and each divided into a number of enclosures, give
access to a corresponding series of open-air naturally planted flights.
To this extent the arrangements may be considered conventional, but
an unusual and striking feature is the addition, at the outer end of
these flights, of relatively enormous further flights, coterminous with
the length of the shelters and furnished with rockwork and pools,
into which the occupants of each division may be released in turn.
In past years many visitors have gazed awestruck at the portentous
wonder of the Giant Whydah-bird in majestic flight round these
spacious enclosures, but this year we had to be content with his
slightly less impressive, though no less interesting, cousin, Jackson's

Whydah. One of the company present, who has probably done more
than any other member of the Society to enable us to admire in life
some of the avian wonders from overseas, created much interest by
his description of the scene in Kenya when an examination of the
far-flung landscape disclosed a number of dancing black dots--the
cocks of Jackson's Whydah busy at their courtship.
A very sweet singer, of chestnut and black plumage, caused a
certain number of inquiries, principally from the younger members
present, as to its identity ; it is indicative of the starved condition of
aviculture in this wonderful post-war epoch that the formerly familiar
Alario Finch should have been unknown to quite a number of the
visitors. But probably to all this unassuming little serin struck a new
chord of endearment as he followed the movements of the company
from his own side of the wire, uttering his cheerful melody. Some
Pekin Robins in the same enclosure were also evocative of nostalgic
memories, but a different emotion was aroused by the Rothschild's
Grackles, for most of us know well enough that one of the few certain
things in a world of uncertainties is that we shall never be able to
contemplate our own specimens of this marvel from the island of Bali.
A turfed bank in front of the large enclosures enables one to stand
at some little elevation above the level of the floors of the flights, and,
overlooking the aviaries from this vantage point, one was well able
to appreciate the manifold beauties of their largest inmates--two
pairs of Specifer Peafowl, recently imported. These belong to the
Annamese form of this species, differing slightly in its head ornamenta-
tion from the typical Burmese race, although the rich green of the
neck is of an identical hue in both. These are very spiteful birds and
the attendant does not care to enter their enclosure without a broom
or similar implement for warding off their attacks.
To the left of these large aviaries are two ranges of smaller ones,
consisting of shelters and flights, many of them untenanted at present,
but the Albino Grow remarked on last year still attracted attention,
although he now has a formidable competitor in a Black-winged
Grackle, whose ejaculations and apparently semi-strangulated
gurglings caused much amusement, of which the pearly-eyed
perpetrator appeared not to be entirely unaware.
A path behind the main block of aviaries, incidentally affording
peeps of their interior economy through the glass windows of the
shelters, allows inspection of the main range of Parrakeet aviaries.
The birds to be seen here, although not reaching the variety visible
in the halcyon ante-bellum years, were well worthy of attention. The
famous strain of lutino Ring-necks is flourishing exceedingly, and--
one doubts which is the more gratifying--Queen Alexandra's, that
most charming member, both of its particular order and of the
Australian avifauna as a whole, bids fair to make a very good second

in prolificacy. The chaste pastel shades of the latter contrasted in an
exceedingly attractive manner with the vivid canary-yellow of the
lutinos.
A brisk tootling on the horn of our host's wheeled chair warned the
company that it was now time to give its attention to the waterfowl,
to which the way led downhill to an adjacent part of the estate,
where the duck ponds provide a spectacle, equally idyllic, of various
species of the anatine race, enjoying surroundings exactly suited to
their requirements. Barrels fixed to trees provide nesting sites for
Mandarin Ducks, but, seeing nothing of the birds themselves, we
were informed that, being full-winged, they were just then paying
a visit to the neighbouring river, neither did they return that after-
noon. Some Carolinas were, however, to be seen, and Grey Teal,
Chilean and Bahama Pintail, and Eyton's Tree-Duck were among
the most prominent occupants of the ponds, but the main attraction
to the guests that afternoon was undoubtedly provided by the Ruddy-
headed and Ashy-headed Geese, of which a young family of goslings
was being reared. Their parents had the free range of the many-
acred enclosure which they share with a number of other birds and
mammals. This is surrounded by a wire-netting fence, the top of
which is bent over to exclude vermin, and the occupants include a
herd of Blackbuck, whose antics are a delight and a tonic--one
trusts to themselves as well as to their entranced human observers.
On being cajoled into motion, they career across the glades, periodic-
ally indulging in their characteristic leaps as they run. If there is
one thing more delightful to watch than the leaping of an adult
Blackbuck, it is the leaping of a baby Blackbuck. As he suddenly
interrupts his earthbound run to rise in the air, he seems for a brief
instant to remain stationary in mid-career, until he descends and the
observer realizes, what he had half suspected for a moment not to be
the case, that this leaper is bound by the laws of gravitation after all,
and has to descend to earth again, as do other terrestrial bodies. The
dash forward is then resumed, until, one after another, the herd
again indulges in heavenward movements, which, one feels sure, are,
under such circumstances as these, actuated quite as much by pure
joie de vivre as by the desire or instinct to confuse a pursuer.
A number of Wallabies hop about in this enclosure and breed well,
as do the Muntjac deer. Among avian species, the charming
trumpeters which formerly ranged here, waiting for human visitors
to whom they could temporarily attach themselves, are, alas ! no
more, but Jungle-fowl, blue Grossoptilon Pheasants, and Guinea-fowl,
which the alert and experienced eye of Mr. J. Bailey enabled him to
identify as the Kenya Crested species, although at several hundred
yards distance, are still to be seen.
Returning to the house for tea, the party listened on the lawn to the

rich notes of a Shama which could be seen at an upper window pouring
its song over an English landscape, and was also enabled to appreciate
the flashing scintillations caused by the sun's rays on the metallic
plumage of Sunbirds inhabiting neighbouring cages.
After tea some of the party visited the paddocks, where Demoiselle,
Stanley, and White-necked Cranes lead what is practically a natural
existence. Others explored the beautifully laid-out grounds, with
their miniature cascades, leading down from the terrace to a large
lily pond, across which it had been necessary to stretch strands of wire
to protect the shoal of fish it contains from the appetites of the Herons
which would otherwise have engulfed them. Some Chukor Partridges
find congenial retreats among the bushes in this part of the garden.
The guests took a reluctant farewell of their host and hostess, and
of their family, with many sincere expressions of gratitude for the
way in which they had worked so hard to entertain the members of
the Society.

Frank (Bring 'em-back-alive) Buck, now recovered from a serious
car accident, left London on 22nd June for Singapore. This is his
first expedition since the war, and he hopes to get together a large
collection for various American Zoos. Also, while in Malaya, he is

G. E. Lodge, considered by many Britain's foremost bird artist,
held an exhibition of Falconry, Bird, and Animal pictures at Rowland
Ward's Galleries, 31st May-25th June. Over eighty years of life have
in no way dimmed Lodge's eye, and he still paints with the skill and
sureness for which he is so justly famed.
And speaking of Rowland Ward's, R. G. Witting has for some
months been engaged in enlarging the Natural History book depart-
ment. As many of our readers are aware, Witting, besides having
very considerable ornithological knowledge, is also something of a
linguist.

chapters of this book. Much of it could be sought for in vain in the
average zoological text-book, yet it is of prime importance in the under-
standing of bird biology and especially of the ecological relationships
of birds. Birds are not, as is often the case with ornithological writers,
taken right out of their context and treated as beings apart. Here we
find bird-life treated both structurally and functionally in its relation-
ship to reptiles on the one hand and mammals on the other. Sections
of particular interest that have been neatly handled in the space
available are the origin of flight, the question of preening, Pigeons'
milk, and reproductive processes generally.
It is unfortunate that in a work of this kind a Peacock's train should
be referred to (p. 27) as its tail. This is the type of popular error one
expects to see corrected in a book of this character. The reference (p. 29)
to a boiled lobster's colour as being of similar origin to a red coun-
tenance or a cock's comb is both unnecessary and erroneous. The
reviewer moreover cannot agree that a frog uses its voice solely as
a sexual call (p. 56). There are one or two serious mistakes in the
diagrams ; coccyx is misspelled on the figure of the cock's skeleton
(p. 15), whilst on p. 93 surely the legend reads wrongly in respect of
the air-sacs and lungs.
These, however, are minor errors which do not detract seriously
from the general value of the book, which is greatly assisted by Mr.
Brightwell's sketches, executed in his usual lively style, giving zest to
the theme, lifting it out of the category of necrology into the realm of
the living bird.

Death of Vice-President of Avicultural Society of America.
English aviculturists will be grieved to learn of the sudden and violent death,
21 st February, of Mr. Andrew Gibbs Orear, Third Vice-President of the Avicultural
Society of America, as the result of a motoring accident on a lonely stretch of Arizona
desert highway. Mr. Orear joined the Society shortly after its formation more than
twenty years ago and always had been one of its most enthusiastic supporters. He
had served it well as President, Treasurer, Secretary, Director, and Vice-President.
An expert photographer, the many charming movies in colour which he made of
birds and beautiful scenery encountered on his travels were a constant source of
delight to the members of the Society to whom he showed them at the monthly
meetings. During the war Mr. Orear was one of the leaders of the movement which
resulted in the sending of packets of seed to various English aviculturists. His passing

Rock Pebbler : An Early Breeding Record.
Alan Lendon mentions (p. 54) an early breeding record for Queen Alexandra's
Parrakeet. Another early Polytelis record, one invariably overlooked by Australian
aviculturists, is for the Rock Pebbler. A. J. North writes in the Ibis, 1894, 260,
that Mr. W. White " found this Parrakeet breeding during September, 1863, in the
holes of the large Eucalypti overhanging the banks of the Murray River above the
north-west bend near Pudnooka in South Australia. ... A pair of these birds obtained
by Mr. White in the same locality and placed in his aviary nested during October,
1865, in the hollow limb of a tree, successfully rearing three young ones from a
clutch of four eggs

Mistaken Identity of Plate of Common King Parrakeet.
In Dr. Lendon's interesting article on the Australian Parrakeets, reference is made
to the plate of the King Parrakeet in Dr. Greene's well-known work, and, as Dr.
Lendon rightly says, the plate " is poor in that there is too much blue on the mantle
and tail and the pale wing-band is not shown ".
It would appear that the plate is not one of the Common King at all, but of one
of the " Island " Kings --probably the Amboina Island King or possibly the Salwatty,
both of which, if I remember rightly, have much blue on the inter-scapular region,
while the upper side of the tail is decidedly bluish and there is no " butterfly "
marking on the wing---and, as such, is a drawing of fair merit.
No doubt it was made from a skin, and it is curious that such a mistake should
have occurred over so common a bird.

The subject of the accompanying plate was collected in July, 1948,
in British Gameroons, and brought home alive to the London Zoo,
where it still survives (July, 1949). Its interest lies in its queer form,
its bare head, and its unusual nesting habits. It is also very rare, has
been seen in the wild state only by two other Europeans, and has
never before been exhibited alive. When one is familiar with the
families of birds, the genera and species of which are dotted so pro-
fusely all over the Ethiopian Region, it comes as a great surprise to
find something that seems to have no close affinities with anything
else. The Grey-necked Picathartes is such a bird. It was formerly
called a Bald Grow, but more recently has been found to have no
affinities at all with the Gorvidae but to be related anatomically to the
Starlings. However, its exact position in the systematic list has yet
to be determined.
It is somewhat Jay-like in form and size, with a long neck and long
legs, but in some ways, such as its rounded wings and longish rounded
tail, it strikes one as having affinities with the Babblers (Timeliidae).
Its head is completely bare, the skin of the anterior portion being blue,
the posterior red, and the sides black. The blue skin has the remark-
able appearance of closely-matted feathers. On the ground the bird
progresses in long bounding hops but, except when feeding, is
apparently arboreal. It is insectivorous, subsisting on termites,
grasshoppers, cockroaches, beetle larvae, etc. It does not scratch
but sweeps its beak sideways when wanting to turn over the earth or
leaves, and often picks up lumps of earth in its bill and throws them
to one side to get the insects underneath.
The story of the bird's capture is an interesting one and shows that
collecting (like fishing) can occasionally bring forth phenomenal luck.

150 C. S. WEBB-SOME NOTES ON THE GREY-NECKED PIGATHARTES
staying on a rubber plantation near the Mungo River which divides
British and French territory. This is nine miles from Kumba and
about seventy miles from the coast. The rainfall in this district is
very heavy and unfortunately for me, the rainy season commenced
shortly after my arrival. Early one morning during the incessant
rain, a native arrived at my headquarters carrying a very bedraggled-
looking bird. He had caught it accidentally in a porcupine trap--a
native-made contraption comprising a running noose made of cord
that is attached to a bent sapling. These traps are very powerful
and are set in the runs of Brush-tailed Porcupines, both in the planta-
tions and the forest. The question of injury does not arise as every-
thing captured is destined for the pot. This fate would have befallen
the luckless bird we are now discussing, if it had not been for my
presence. That it was uninjured was as much a miracle as its capture.
My surprise on seeing that it was a Picathartes oreas can well be
imagined, considering that no one had seen it in the British
Gameroons since the type specimen was obtained in 1899. The only
four skins in the British Museum were got in the French Gameroons
and were collected by native hunters for Mr. G. L. Bates, the well-
known ornithologist, who resided there for over twenty years. He
himself saw Picathartes on one occasion only. The Paris Museum
contains only one skin.
As far as is known at present, it is confined to the wildest parts of
the Gameroons forest at no great distance from the coast. Its apparent
rarity is probably due to the fact that the parts of the jungle most
suited to its requirements are very inaccessible. It makes an open
mud nest on an overhanging rock-face and such places are distinctly
rare in the British Gameroons. Such sheltered situations are very
necessary, for although nesting takes place in the so-called dry season,
there are always showers, and owing to the large size of the mud-
nests, they collapse easily when wet. The base of the nest is pure
mud, but higher up it is interwoven with fibres, and the rim is a
mixture of mud, small sticks, fibres, and leaves. According to Bates,
the egg is blotched and glossless.
The strange thing is that the native who caught my bird had never
seen it before, and I was unable to find anybody, even experienced
woodmen familiar with jungle birds, who knew anything about the
bird or its nesting habits. To all the old bushmen, I explained the
sort of rock-face that Picathartes nested on, and offered a large reward
to anyone who could lead me to such a place, but the result was
negative. My own specimen interested me so much that I was deter-
mined to find out all I could while the opportunity presented itself.
As my specimen was captured soon after daybreak, I deduced that it
had only moved a short distance from its roosting-place, so with this
in my mind I got the native to lead me to the scene of capture. It

was a fairly long trek through very hilly forest. At this season (July)
the larger streams were converted into raging torrents, and the forest
was wet and gloomy. The only information of any interest that the
boy could give me when we arrived at the spot, was that another
similar bird had flown up when he approached the trap. This at
least seemed to indicate that Picathartes travels in pairs, and that
this one was " standing by " its captured mate.
In the rainy season the forest here is most uninviting, to say the
least. The foliage is always dripping and owing to the dense canopy
of the tree-tops there is little light. To add to this, divergent spurs
with deep intersecting valleys strewn with fallen tree-trunks, make
exploration a strenuous business as well as upsetting one's sense of
direction.
For many days I returned alone to this spot and set nets in the hope
of catching the mate of my captive Picathartes, but by now the rain
was almost incessant. Frustrated in this effort by the weather, I
decided to make a thorough search for a possible roosting or nesting
place. While taking a tortuous course along a ridge, which is the
only way of getting along at any speed, I noticed that the terrain on
one side seemed to fall away particularly abruptly, so I investigated.
In descending the slope I came to a spot where I was confronted with
a vertical drop of about 12 feet. Skirting this and coming to the
lower side, I found a bare and slightly overhanging sandstone rock-
face. The top was adorned with a cloak of hanging plants down
which water cascaded from above. The height of the bare part of
the rock (7 feet) was not as much as I had hoped for, but being fairly
near where my bird was captured, it seemed very promising.
Quickly scanning the rock, I saw the remains of three large mud
nests which I knew could not have been made by anything but
Picathartes. Water was seeping through fissures in the rock and was
trickling on to the nests, and had caused the upper portions to break
away. One nest had fresh claw-marks on the soggy part that remained
on the rock-face. It seemed that one bird (or pair) had departed from
making the orthodox mud nest, and instead had utilized a saucer-
shaped depression on a rock shelf with an overhanging ledge. This
was lined with fibres and leaves in the same manner as the others.
Greatly encouraged by this find, I revisited the place and set nets,
but the rain increased and for a whole month it hardly ceased. More
and more water seeped through the rocks and a considerable volume
poured over the top. To ascertain if Picathartes came here to roost,
I set off one evening and concealed myself in the undergrowth near
the rock. It was a gloomy business, but I remained until it was quite
dark. There was no sign of Picathartes. I think they had been roosting
here until very recently, but the excessive rain had made things too
uncomfortable for them. It was eerie in the extreme when I tried to

find my way back ; the night was pitch black, and as I scrambled
through the dripping undergrowth alone, my main concern was
whether the bulb of my torch would give out. It was a great relief
to get clear of the forest on to a path, although I still had two raging
torrents to wade through, and a precipitous hill 300 feet high to scale.
In spite of the rain, I made this long tiring journey twice daily in
order to look at my nets, but conditions were completely against
catching anything. However, my efforts were not wasted, for on one
occasion when I was sheltering beneath the overhanging rock and
resting in preparation for the return journey, a Picathartes landed as
silently as a phantom on a sapling only a few feet from me. Its
behaviour was most interesting, for it made no alarm note, but
stretched its long neck forward for a second while peering at me, and
then flew to the ground from a height of six feet and made off at
great speed through the undergrowth with a series of enormous hops.
As it was alone, I took it to be the mate of my captive specimen. On
another occasion, when sitting in the same place watching the streams
of water cascading over my head, and thinking of primitive man who
sheltered under rocks just as I was doing, I was brought sharply back
to the present by two Picathartes that seemed about to alight on top
of me. They arrived silently, as the first one had done, and again
neither made any alarm note on seeing me, in spite of being only a few
feet away. One clung to a thin vertical sapling, exactly as a Reed-
warbler clings to reed-stumps. These two flew silently away, and
this was the last I saw of Picathartes in the wild state.
One can only guess why these birds visited their old nesting-site,
but I noticed that the smaller crevices in the rock were teeming with
crickets and cockroaches, which may have been the attraction.
The thing that impressed me most about these birds, apart from
their unusual shape and bare heads, was their quick movements and
appearance of alertness.
Most of the low-level forest dwelling birds in the Gameroons are
small and dull in colour. That they have to be continuously on the
look-out for natural enemies lurking in the undergrowth, was brought
home to me by the number of times that birds were taken from my
nets by some unseen intruder leaving only some tell-tale feathers,
blood, and perhaps a large hole. But I never once saw the culprits,
which were probably mongooses. It is obvious then that in order to
survive, a bird so large and conspicuous as Picathartes, feeding as it
does largely on the ground, must be silent and quick in its movements
and have excellent hearing and sight.
Experience has taught me that even a bird so large as Picathartes
can be quite plentiful without anyone suspecting it. That is why I
persevered, even though native testimony suggested that the bird was
almost non-existent. I was thinking of an experience I had in Annam,

Indo-China, many years ago. There, on the Col des Nuages, I spent
several months collecting the local forest-dwelling birds. At the time
of my visit, Ghaulet's Cissa was known only by one skin which had
been obtained by a native. This bird approximates Picathartes in
size and habits and somewhat resembles it in form, except for the
bare head, but it is more conspicuous, having colours of yellow and
green. A museum expedition with the aid of native hunters failed
to get another specimen, or even to see one in this locality while I was
there, and yet shortly afterwards I trapped five live specimens during
a fortnight, in a single spring-net trap set on the ground and baited
with mealworms. Seeing that I never once got a glimpse of these
Gissas, and no other European had ever seen one, this is a remarkable
instance of how an apparently conspicuous bird, feeding in the lower
stratum of the forest, can escape detection. The birds of the upper
stratum have not developed this extraordinary alertness as they have
not the same natural enemies lurking around.
No doubt Picathartes also has its sight and hearing so well developed
that it manages to escape detection to an extent that people imagine
it to be much rarer than is actually the case. In fact, had it not been
for the adverse weather, I feel sure I could have captured some more
of these birds and found out more about their habits. It will be
surprising if this species is not found to have a wider range than is
known at present. I see no reason why it should not extend into
Spanish Guinea and Gaboon.
According to published descriptions of P. oreas&gt; the underparts are
white, whereas the belly of my live specimen was buff in colour at
the time of capture, but has faded a little since. This bird has the
curious habit of puffing out the throat. The only call-note it has made
is a low ga-a-a.
Obviously the peculiar nesting habits of Picathartes has served it
well in the struggle for survival, and to depart from them would seem
to involve considerable risk, but that there are individuals willing to
experiment is shown by the instance of the nest I found in a depression
on a rock shelf. But a bigger departure from the normal is the nest
discovered by Mr. Reis in a hollow log.
A few days before my departure from British Gameroons the rain
eased up, and so I was able to photograph the nesting site, although
the forest was still exceedingly gloomy. With an extra rapid pan-
chromatic film, I had to give an exposure of one second with the stop
at 3-8. This will give some idea of the dark conditions prevailing in
the forest at midday at a time when the sun was trying to peep through
the clouds.
I have used the English name Grey-necked Picathartes in view of
the fact that " Grey-necked Bald Crow " does not now apply. Banner-
man in his Birds of Tropical West Africa , in place of Bald Grow, has

called Picathartes " Bare-headed Rock-fowl ". However, as it is
not a gallinaceous bird and, as far as the Cameroon species is con-
cerned, does not necessarily dwell among rocks, but requires a rock-
face only for nesting purposes, I see no reason for retaining this name.
There is one other species of Picathartes--the Yellow-necked
Picathartes (P. gymnocephala ), which was first obtained in the Gold
Coast, but has not been seen there for over fifty years. Many years
ago a few specimens were collected in the neighbouring territory of
Togoland. Latterly it has, quite surprisingly, been recorded some
700 miles further west in the territory of Sierra Leone where, it appears,
certain localities are particularly suited to its requirements. The two
species of Picathartes are separated by many hundreds of miles which
includes the whole of Nigeria.

When on a visit to Belgium in the autumn of 1947, I learnt from
Madame G. Derscheid that Her Majesty Queen Elisabeth was very
interested in the waterfowl on the lakes at the Palace of Laeken, and
that a pair of Black Swans would be a welcome addition, as there
were only two old birds, both males, at Laeken.
When I returned to England, I told our President about this, and
with his usual generosity he immediately agreed that the Avicultural
Society should offer to present a pair of Black Swans to Queen Elisa-
beth, and that he would be responsible for purchasing the birds.
At that time Black Swans were extremely scarce, and it was not
possible to procure any till a promise was given by Mr. Terry Jones
that a pair should be reserved from Mr. Spedan Lewis's Black Swans
when they nested in the autumn of 1948. A brood of five were hatched
on 17th October, and these were sexed at three months old and a pair
chosen.
A letter was then sent by the President and Hon. Secretary to
Monsieur de Streel, Secretary to the Queen, as follows :--
" As President and Hon. Secretary of the Avicultural Society,
whose object is the study of British and foreign birds in freedom and
in captivity, we are venturing to approach you.

include some Australian Black Swans on the lake of the Palace of
Laeken, and we should be greatly honoured to be allowed to present
Her Majesty with these birds. Black Swans have become very
difficult to procure since the war, but our Society has been fortunate
enough to secure a young pair which could be sent to Belgium this
summer.
" We should be particularly honoured and gratified if Her Majesty
would graciously accept this modest token of homage of a British
Society which consists of 550 members, has been in existence for
over fifty years, and is in close touch with the principal British and
foreign scientific societies.
" We shall be greatly obliged if you will be so good as to inform
us whether you consider that Her Majesty, whose interest in every-
thing concerning Science and Nature we all know, would be willing
graciously to accept these birds which we offer with our humble
respects."
The following reply was received :--
" Her Majesty Queen Elisabeth of Belgium has instructed me to
convey Her sincerest thanks for your most amiable offer. The Queen
will be very pleased receiving from the Avicultural Society a young
pair of Australian Black Swans, and accepts your gracious present as
a token of sympathy from the Avicultural Society.
" May I suggest you let me know the names of the members of the
Avicultural Society who will come to Brussels in the near future.
Her Majesty will be pleased to meet them and have the pleasure of
seeing you."
The Swans were then, by the kind offices of Mr. Gansdale, sent by
air to the Antwerp Zoo, where Mr. Walter Van den bergh, the Director,
was good enough to take charge of them for a few days. The Swans
were taken to Laeken on 4th June by the Hon. Secretary, Mr. A. A.
Prestwich, Miss Kay Bonner, and myself, accompanied by Madame G.
Derscheid and Madame J. M. Derscheid. Though Her Majesty had
been ill and was confined to her private apartments, she nevertheless
expressed the wish to have the Swans presented to her personally,
and they were taken to her room in a basket. This very gracious act
on the part of Her Majesty was greatly appreciated.
The Swans were then released on one of the lakes in the Palace
grounds, and after having swum round and investigated the whole
place most thoroughly, they settled down well. It is hoped that
they will found a dynasty of Black Swans which will be a token of
the friendship between Great Britain and Belgium.
Our grateful thanks are expressed to Mr. Walter Van den bergh
for taking care of the Swans at Antwerp, and for making all the

M. A. DECOUX'S COLLECTION AT GERY,
HAUTE VIENNE, FRANCE

<bodyText confidence="0.989754363636364" page_id="56311888"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
M. A. Decoux is one of our oldest members. For over forty years he
has kept a very large and choice collection of small birds, Parrakeets
and Doves, and his breeding successes, often recorded in this magazine,
have been extremely numerous. Of much the same age, M. Decoux
and I have been friends of very long standing. I have very often been
at his place at Gery, near Limoges, and I was glad to be there with
him again last summer. My previous visit had taken place under
tragic circumstances in June, 1940 : in the disorderly retreat of those
dark days I had the idea to stop with my men at Gery : it would in
any case save my friend the trouble of billeting more objectionable
soldiers ! I had hardly arrived there when the Fooks family, fleeing
the Germans, also arrived, to leave two days later for Bordeaux and
St. Jean de Luz, where they found their way out to England for the
duration, while I was leaving for Agen, further south, and eventually
for America.
Through correspondence, and later on when I saw M. Decoux
again in Paris and at Cleres, I had heard the reassuring news that his
aviaries and birds had not suffered too much during the war.
Until the end of 1942, Gery had been situated in the unoccupied
zone of France, which later on the Germans never held so tightly as
the northern half of the country. Not only was their control much
slighter, but their troops only occupied large towns or important
strategic points, so that Gery never saw the invaders. The only losses
in the bird collection was caused by the lack of proper food and care,
which affected mostly insect and fruit-eating birds, all of which
eventually died. But the greatest part of the large collection of Finches,
Parrakeets, and Doves could be saved. During the past four years,
many new birds have come to Gery, while also numbers of young
reared there have helped restocking other aviaries.
The installations were not damaged. They include about forty-five
moveable aviaries for Parrakeets built after the Duke of Bedford's
principles, most of them very large, which are set on the
lawns of the big pleasure garden which surrounds the house. A fine

block of five compartments, also in the same garden, is inhabited by
small birds and Doves. A dozen roomy aviaries for Lories, Doves, and
small birds have been built in a neighbouring meadow, and a large
flight, the oldest aviary in the place, with five small compartments on
either side, all for small birds, is placed along the wall of the kitchen
garden. A couple of bird rooms complete the establishment. All the
aviaries, except some of the moveable ones, are neatly built of slender
steel frames and mouse-proof wire netting, with large brick and
concrete shelters and foundations, pleasantly planted with shrubs.
A small pond is used for Mandarin and Carolina Ducks.
To-day the collection of Parrakeets still is very important. Among
the Australian species, all of the more usual ones are present, but
I noticed particularly pairs of Brown's, Barnard's, Twenty-eights,
Bauer's, Many-coloured, King, Crimson-wing, Barraband's, Rock
Peplars, Queen Alexandra's Parrakeets, and there still is an old cock
Yellow-bellied. The Grass Parrakeets are represented by a number of
Bourkes, Elegants and Blue-wings, and several varieties of Budgerigars,
Opalines, pure Whites, and Yellows. There are also various Lovebirds,
including Blue Masked. The Lory collection consists of Swainsons, Red
Collared, Mitchell's and Yellow breasted; an old Scaly Lorikeet
produces every year hybrids with a Swainson. Some rare odd birds,
which it has been impossible to pair off, are a golden-fronted New
Zealand Parrakeet, a Musk Lorikeet, and a Latham, bred at Gery
many years ago. A pet Red-and-blue Macaw lives at liberty, while
a Great Black Cockatoo, very tame and gentle, is kept on a stand in
the bird room, which is slowly filling up again with new insectivorous
birds, now including Shamas and various Glossy Starlings and
Thrushes.
The collection of Doves is good and breeds well. There are all the
more usual species, among which Diamond, Peaceful, and Crested
produce every year many pairs of young. Brush and Common Bronze-
wings, Jobi, Grayson's, Bleeding-heart, and Ashy Ground Doves are
among the most interesting.
The small bird collection is not to-day, of course, what it used to be,
but nevertheless, it is an exciting one. All the West African species of
Weavers, Whydahs, and Waxbills, now easily obtainable in France,
are there, even some of the rarest such as Quail Finches and various
unusual Firefinches. The Australian species are represented by
Gouldian, Ruficaudas, Masked and Long-tailed Finches ; there are
also some Indian Avadavats and Red-headed Parrot Finches. Zebra
Finches nest by the dozen, and include the White and Isobelline
varieties. There are even some New World species : Red Cardinals,
Nonpareils, Indigo Buntings, Cuban Finches, and some Red
Pileated Finches, the latter reared on the spot through many genera-
tions.

158 A. R. ROBERTSON-BREEDING SUCCESSES IN SOUTH AFRICA
It is a comfort to find that not only the large Gery collection of birds,
but many others in Central and Western France, particularly in the
Vendee, are still flourishing. Most of the bird seeds have always been
grown commercially in that district, so that they were still procurable
throughout the war and after. Therefore a certain stock of seed-eating
birds could be maintained and their breeding continued, without
great difficulties. What handicaps French aviculture to-day is the
control of bird importations, which requires special permits difficult
to obtain from the Finance and Health departments. But altogether
the situation, uneasy as it is, has much improved and is not nearly so
desperate as it still is in England.

By A. R. Robertson, M.B., Ch.B.
South Africa should be an aviculturists paradise. There is every
inducement in this country for birds to breed. Sunshine all the year
round, mild winters with warm sunny days and an abundance of seed
and insectivorous food. Most of our aviculturists prefer aviaries,
a flight and shelter, and the seedeaters are the most popular birds kept.
There is as far as I know only one softbill enthusiast and he is Mr.
Gleugh. There is one more exception, Mrs. Galbraith, of Gape Town,
who successfully keeps and breeds Knysna Louries.
The Waxbill is the most popular of all our native birds and no
aviary is complete without a collection of them. Considerable progress
has been made in breeding our native birds, and with the increased
knowledge of habits and diet there should be a further improvement
in breeding successes later.
We find that it is easier to breed foreign birds in South Africa than
it is to breed our indigenous species. However, there have been some
notable successes during the last three years and some of them I
believe ought to be mentioned. The most interesting breeding recorded
is that of the Paradise Whydah (Steganura paradisea ).
For many years controversies have raged about the breeding
habits of the Paradise Widow Bird, the consensus of opinion
being that it was parasitic and that its host was one of the
Waxbill family. This supposition is correct, and has been borne out
by the recent breeding of the P.W.B. in captivity by independent
aviculturists in two successive seasons. In both cases the Melba Finch
(,Zonogastris melba ) was the host.
I am able to give fairly accurate details of this breeding in the
aviaries of Mrs. Prinsloo, Evaton, Transvaal, and can state definitely
that the breeding by Mr. Cronje of Pretoria was accepted only after
the birds had been examined by members of the Avicultural Society.

A. R. ROBERTSON-BREEDING SUCCESSES IN SOUTH AFRICA 159
Mrs. Prinsloo keeps a mixed African collection comprising mainly the
Waxbill family. She has a large aviary approximately 8 feet by 24 feet
by 12 feet, consisting of a large flight and a smaller sleeping portion.
The sleeping portion is well stocked with cat-bush, a kind of thorny
evergreen found in most parts of this country. The flight has a large
pepper tree growing in it. The collection is fed on Manna-seed only
(small kind of millet), green food to the desired amount, and of course
a very generous supply of termites. Antheaps are found by the thou-
sand, only a matter of yards from the farmstead. In this large collection
there were several pairs of Melba Finches, two P.W.B. cocks and only
one hen. Three pairs of Melba Finches went to nest at different times
during the breeding season. Each time their nest were parasitized by
the P.W.B. hen. During the course of the incubation period by the
first Melba hen it was noticed that the Paradise hen paid visits to
the Melba Finch's nest. These visits were looked upon as a nuisance
because Mrs. Prinsloo was rather keen on breeding Melba Finches.
Not a thought was given to the real intention of the Paradise
hen. Only when the Melbas left the nest did one realize what had been
happening. Three young ones left the nest, two were Melbas, of that
there was no doubt, but the third, although it looked like a young
Melba Finch, was not one. Its shape was different, its head different,
and even though its wings had a green sheen on them it did not possess
the one important distinguishing feature, and that is that its tail had
the same dull colour as its body and not the deep wine colour of the
other two Melba babies. As it grew older and was able to fend for
itself it left the Melbas and was to be found only with the Paradise
Whydahs which it now resembled very closely. When the second
Melba Finch went to the nest I examined the eggs; there were six in all.
Five were almost identical and white, and I presumed Melba eggs,
the sixth egg white as well, but larger and longer than the other eggs.
From this nest eventually only one Paradise Whydah was reared.
The Paradise Whydah did not only confine her maraudings to the nest
of Melba Finches but laid eggs in the nests of every Australian Zebra
Finch she could find.
Her eggs were larger than unfertile eggs of Melba Finches which
were kept for comparison. In a third nest of Melbas a third Paradise
Whydah bird was hatched out. When they moulted out into the first
summer plumage there were two hens and one cock. Mrs. Prinsloo
watched the Paradise hen going into the Zebra Finch nests. There
was, as far as she was able to see, no attempt at destroying the eggs of
the host.
Violet-eared Waxbills (Granatina granatina). --Violet-eared Wax-
bills are the prettiest and most popular of our Waxbills. As a boy
I used to catch hundreds of these pretty little fellows, only to find that
in captivity they did not live very long. In the Orange Free State, on

the wooded banks of the rivers, they were once plentiful, but with the
influx of people and unscrupulous trappers they have become almost
extinct in those parts and are to be found only now and again in small
swarms. However, in the Bushveld where I spent a holiday on Mrs.
Prinsloo's farm, they were to be seen in hundreds, especially early in
the mornings, at the drinking troughs of the cattle, where they were
fed in the winter months on manna seed. Not only did one see Violet-
ears, but there always came along with them the Melba Finches,
Black-cheeked Waxbills, S.A. Ruddy Breasted Waxbills, Pietjie
Canaries or Mountain Canaries, Yellow Seedeaters (Serinus Jiaviventris),
and several other birds and mainly softbills, the names of which I did
not know. Violet-ears are easy to catch, but one found that the
younger birds took to captivity far more easily than the old birds did ;
they were able to adapt themselves sooner, and the old birds were
always first to die. Violet-ears usually do not live long in captivity,
and it is only recently, since Aviculturists have been studying the
diets of these birds, that they have been able to keep them longer and
also have attempted to breed them in captivity. Several breeding
attempts have been made during the last three to four years. In two
cases these breedings have been successful to a certain extent. The
birds are as much insectivorous as they are granivorous.
In 1943 Mr. Ballack bred not less than seven hens and one cock from
a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills. During the 1944-1945 season I have
had a pair go to nest on several occasions. The eggs have been fertile
on all occasions, but only once did this pair of birds rear two young
ones successfully. There is something very interesting about the way
these young birds have moulted. When they left the nest they were
a drab brown colour with black beaks, black tails, and a violet coloured
rump. After six weeks they moulted into a prettier brown colour
resembling that of an adult hen bird. The beaks became coloured
and the violet ear appeared. The birds can be sexed at this stage too,
the cocks having a small well-defined black throat patch. From about
twelve weeks I have noticed the cocks gradually getting the chocolate
colour of the male adult bird.
The Violet-eared Waxbills lay white eggs, and this pair in captivity
and others I have had go to nest usually lay a clutch of five eggs. The
young when they hatch have black skins and the fluff on their heads
and backs is a dark grey colour. They have several phosphorescent
spots on either side of their beaks. I have noticed that the Melba
Finch's young ones and Violet-ear's young are absolutely identical, and
one wonders if the Paradise Whydah Bird does not parasitize Violet-
eared Waxbills in their native habitat as well as the Melba Finch.
Blue Breasted Waxbills.-- These delightful little fellows are easy
to keep and breed freely in captivity. They are one of the commoner
species of Waxbills and are found in most aviaries.

They make a dome-shaped nest and lay four to five eggs. The
nestlings are usually a dull blackish brown colour. When they leave
their nests they have the same colouring as the adults, only a duller
colour. They are easy to sex, the hens having the dull grey patch on
their abdomen extending up to the chest. The blue colour of the body
is not as bright as it is in the males.
The Common Grey Waxbill.-- These sprightly little fellows are
found everywhere and several subspecies have been described.
Although they are as common as their name denotes it is only recently
that they have started breeding freely in captivity. Most aviculturists
find that they can now be likened to the Australian Zebra Finch, for
once they start breeding it is difficult to stop them. In one season
I can remember breeding over forty of them.
They are usually found along the banks of streams and rivulets ; in
wintertime always in small swarms, very often hundreds of them
together. I have on several occasions observed white ones in the
swarms, and when quite a boy I managed to catch one of these
albinos. I kept it alive for several months. The Common Waxbill or
Rooibekkie is very easily sexed. The cock bird has a black patch which
extends from the vent half-way up the abdomen but the hen does not
have this black patch at all. They make a double-decker nest, a
smaller one on top of the actual nest they breed in, which is supposed
to be for the cock to sleep in. In captivity I find that they often breed
in boxes and any breeding receptacle one has in the aviary.
Pheasants, Partridges and Quails. --Except for the Quail very
few of the others are represented in aviaries, and as far as I am able to
ascertain only the Red Winged Partridges ( Francolinus levaillanti)
and the Coqui Partridge have been bred; neither of these are firmly
established as aviary birds. All of the Quail have been bred excepting
the Blue Quail which I have yet to see. It is found in the low veld,
little being recorded about it. Another pretty bird to keep in captivity
and difficult to keep is the Jameson Ruddy Breasted Waxbill. It has
been bred successfully, butlike its cousin, the South African Fire-finch and
the little Ruddy Breasted Waxbill, it has not been firmly established.
Buntings are always attractive birds in aviaries and we have our
representatives here. The two most commonly kept are the Red Backed
Yellow Bunting ( Emberiza flaviventris flaviventris) and the Rock Bunting
(.Fringillaria tahapsi tahapsi). The former is another one of those difficult
birds to keep in an aviary but when acclimatized they live for several
seasons. They have been bred in captivity by Mr. Strachan of
Johannesburg. Their nests were made of coir and resembled an
ordinary Serin type of nest. They are voracious insect eaters. The
Rock Bunting is an easier bird to keep; although it does not breed
easily it has been bred on several occasions by different members of
the Avicultural Club.

The Serins or Canary type of birds paradoxically are usually the
easiest to cater for and are the hardiest of our own birds, yet the most
elusive when it comes to reproducing their own kind in aviaries.
However, most of them have at one time or other been successfully
bred. The Cape Canary and Blackhead and Striped Canary have
only recently bred. While we have many types of Doves and wild
Pigeons very few people keep them as aviary birds. They are, I think,
difficult to breed and difficult to keep with smaller birds, which are
far more popular as aviary birds. The Cape Rock Pigeon, Turtle
Doves, Ring Doves, and Namaqua Doves have been successfully bred
at various times.

(14) Crimson Rosella {Platycercus elegans)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.93552452" page_id="56311894"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
Synonyms. --Pennant's Parrakeet, Red Lory, Lowry.
Distribution .--This species has an extensive range in the eastern part
of Australia from Cape York in the north down through the eastern
portions of Queensland and New South Wales and throughout most
of Victoria, with the exception of the drier areas, into the south-east of
South Australia. It is also found on Kangaroo Island, where it is rare,
and on Norfolk Island, where it is believed to have been introduced.
Description .--A large Broadtail whose main colour is crimson,
relieved by blue cheek patches, wing margins and tail. The mantle
feathers are black edged with crimson and there is a black shoulder
patch.
The adults of both sexes are very much alike, and the size of the
beak and size and shape of the head is the surest indication of sex ;
most females are as brightly coloured as the males.
Immatures are usually very different from the adults in that the
crimson is largely replaced by dark green with the exception of small
areas on the crown, throat, and under tail-coverts. As in the adult,
the cheeks and wing margins are blue, but the tail is greener and the
mantle and shoulder patches are green. Some immatures, however,
leave the nest as merely duller editions of the adults, the crimson areas
being not as bright and the edges of the mantle feathers being a mixture
of red and green ; the shoulder patches also are more green than in
the adult. I have been unable to ascertain whether this is a constant
feature in some part of the range of the species, but have an idea that
it might occur constantly in the northern birds.

Like the adults, immatures can be sexed with reasonable certainty
by the size and shape of the head and beak. Adult plumage is acquired
by the first full moult, which is completed when the bird is about
fifteen months old. Prior to this, additional crimson feathers have
gradually appeared on the abdomen and a few scattered adult mantle
feathers have also been acquired.
Variations. --At the northernmost extremity of the range, a smaller,
darker bird, which appears to be a valid subspecies {nigrescens) , is
found. The Kangaroo Island bird has been given subspecific rank, but
examination of skins does not suggest that this is worthy of retention.
Coloured Plates. --These are fairly numerous. That by Goodchild
in Seth-Smith (p. 160) is really excellent, whilst that by Roland Green
in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 304), portraying the northern form ( nigrescens ),
is also very good. The plate in Greene (vol. i, p. 141) is fairly good as
regards colouration, but gives a wrong impression of the shape of the
cheek patches. Gould's plate has been reproduced in the recently
published Tropical Birds , and in addition to a good representation of
an adult, shows a young bird in a stage of transition from the green
plumage to that of the adult.
Field Notes. --I have seen this bird on numerous occasions in various
parts of Victoria, and also in New South Wales and Queensland.
They are usually seen in pairs or small parties, and a more vivid sight
than a pair of fully-plumaged adults is hard to imagine. The species
tends to favour hilly country, and does not often appear in more open,
flat country. A few birds can often be seen in the eastern end of
Collins Street, Melbourne, and they are said to nest in the city
buildings !
Aviary Notes. --A favourite aviary bird on account of its hardiness
and gaudy colouring, but no more suitable for a mixed collection
than any of the other larger Broadtails are on account of its pugnacious
nature.
I have seldom been without one or more examples of this species
in my collection, but it has only been in recent years that I have had
sufficient suitable aviaries to enable me to segregate a pair with a view
to breeding. A very fine cock bird obtained in 1938, lost his mate as
a result of a brawl in 1940, and lived a bachelor existence in a mixed
collection, no mate being provided for him until December, 1944.
Then he, too, succumbed after a fight in the spring of 1945, and I did
not replace him till the beginning of 1946. In that year, I attempted
to breed the species for the first time, but although the hen spent a
considerable time in the nesting log during September and October,
no eggs were laid as far as is known. In January, 1947, I obtained
two birds from Sydney, which were reputed to be a breeding pair.
In October of that year they began to take an interest in the log
provided, and on 22nd of the month, the first egg of a clutch of five

was laid. The hen sat very closely, and it was not until 17th November
that two young were observed, the remaining eggs being infertile.
By the end of the month one of the young birds had died, but the
remaining one, a male, survived, and left the nest on 20th December,
in the almost mature crimson plumage previously described. When
disposed of in June, 1948, this bird was in mature plumage except for
some green feathers on the wings in the areas which ultimately become
black. In 1948, the hen of the same pair laid the first egg of a clutch
of six on 24th October, three only being fertile. Two young had
hatched on 19th November, and the third the following day. The
parents on this occasion proved to be very indifferent feeders, and
several times one or more of the young birds were found out of the
nest and had to be replaced. The most advanced young bird con-
tinued to leave the nest very prematurely, and ultimately died on
24th December ; the other two left the nest the following day, and
although practically never fed thereafter by the parents, they appeared
to thrive for a while, but both died about the middle of January.
All three of this clutch left the nest in the crimson plumage, the
youngest, a hen, being a little greener on the margins of the mantle
feathers than the other two, which were a pair.
The medal of the A.S.S.A. was awarded in 1936 for the breeding of
this species to the late E. B. Cox ; unfortunately, the details of this
achievement have been lost. Apart from the above, I am unaware
of any other local successes. There seems to be little doubt that in
the wild state, birds of this species frequently breed when less than a
year old and before the assumption of full plumage ; I have no
record of this having occurred in captivity.
(15) Adelaide Rosella (Platycercus adelaidae)
Synonym .--Adelaide Parrakeet.
Distribution .--Confined to South Australia and extends from the
Flinders Range in the north to the tip of Fleurieu Peninsula (Cape
Jervis) in the south. The species does not appear to.cross the River
Murray, although it approaches to within a few miles of it in places.
Description .--A large Broadtail of approximately the same size as
the preceding species. The prevailing colour of a typical southern
bird is orange-red in varying shades, fading to yellowish on the sides
of the breast, and relieved by blue cheeks, wing margins and tail.
The mantle feathers are black edged with orange-red and there is the
black shoulder patch which is typical of all the Rosellas. Many
females differ but little from the males except in the size and shape
of the head and beak and some have a greenish tinge to the margins
of the mantle feathers.
Immatures are mainly an olive-green colour with brick-red areas

 |on the crown, throat, and subcaudals ; the cheeks and wing margins
are blue as in the adults, but the tail is green. During the first autumn
and winter more red feathers appear, especially on the breast, and a
few adult mantle feathers are acquired. Full adult plumage is not
attained until the first complete moult, when the birds are about
fifteen months old. Immatures can be accurately sexed by the
size and shape of the head and beak.
I have never seen or heard of a young Adelaide leaving the nest in
a semi-mature plumage, like that described for the preceding species.
Variations .--This is a very variable species in the southern part of
its range, some quite bright red and quite yellowish birds being found
in the same locality. Towards Cape Jervis the birds were alleged
to be particularly bright and to approach the Crimson Rosella in
colouration, and it was considered that some infusion of blood from
the adjacent Kangaroo Island birds might have occurred ; several
recent visits to the district in question do not support this view, as
some quite pale birds were noted amongst the flocks seen, and it
would therefore appear that the subspecies fleuriensis is not a valid
one. In the Flinders Range the birds are much paler and the breasts
are yellow, with only a little red mottling thereon ; this subspecies
(.subadelaidae ) was formerly thought to be a variant of the Yellow
Rosella {P. flaveolus).
Coloured Plates .--Except in Gould, coloured plates seem to be non-
existent ; even Mathews does not figure the bird. For the reader who
is unfamiliar with the species, it is best to imagine a Crimson Rosella
in which the crimson areas of the plumage are replaced by varying
shades of brick-red, orange, and yellow
Field Notes. --A very common bird in the Mount Lofty Ranges close
to Adelaide, and even occurring at times in the parklands around the
city. Seen in pairs, family parties, and, especially in the case of young
birds, in small flocks. Is frequently seen in orchards, where it does
considerable damage.
Aviary Notes. --A common cage bird in South Australia but quite
rare in other parts of Australia, not being regarded as particularly
attractive in colouring by most Parrot-lovers.
I still possess a hen bird that was in adult plumage when I obtained
her in January, 1936 ; a mate was obtained for her a couple of
months later, and they survived in a mixed collection until the cock
was killed in a fight in 1943 ; limitations of space and the fact of the
species being so common locally had always predisposed against any
attempts being made to breed from them, although they had always
looked a likely pair. In December, 1944, an immature male of the
northern race was obtained, but again in 1945 they were not segregated.
In 1946, the erection of additional breeding aviaries gave this species
its first chance to reproduce in my collection. Somewhat to my

surprise, I found a broken egg in the log on 15th October, and two
days later a second egg was laid but this, too, was broken the next
day. As the cock was seen emerging from the log he was regarded
with suspicion ; it is not known if any further eggs were laid that
season. In view of this experience, I substituted a new young cock
of the southern race prior to the 1947 breeding season, and in due
course the first egg of a clutch of five appeared on 16th October ; four
of these were fertile. On 14th November three recently hatched young
were found dead in the log, the fate of the fourth egg being unknown ;
whether the hen did not feed them or whether they were murdered
by one or other parent remains a mystery. Feeling that it was so
long since the hen had had a chance to breed that she might be out
of practice, I decided to give the same pair another chance in 1948,
and a clutch of five, of which the first disappeared, was started on
23rd September. The remaining four eggs proved fertile and were
incubated steadily, but by 26th October three eggs had disappeared,
and the fourth by the next day ; investigation revealed two newly-
hatched dead chicks in the log. Another attempt was made in that
a clutch of four was commenced on 24th November, and all proved
fertile. Two of these were transferred to another Broadtail that was
incubating a clutch of clear eggs and she, incidentally, deserted them
before they were due to hatch ; the remaining two were incubated
by the mother with the usual result, namely death of the chicks shortly
after they had hatched on 18th December. To date, therefore, I have
not succeeded in rearing Adelaide Rosellas, and it does not look as
if I am likely to be successful with the present old hen.
The A.S.S.A. deemed the Adelaide Rosella ineligible for a medal
award, probably because it was recorded by A. J. Campbell as having
been bred by Mr. White, of Reedbeds, many years ago. Apart from
this record, the only success that I am aware of is that of H. J. Packer,
of Gilberton, who reared two young birds in 1946, but I feel certain
that there must have been other successes.
Like the preceding species, it seems definite that Adelaide Rosellas
breed in the wild state before they have assumed full adult plumage.
(16) Yellow Rosella (Platycercus flaveolus)
Synonyms. --Yellow-rumped Parrakeet, Murray Rosella.
Distribution .--Confined to the vicinity of the Murray River and its

south as the town of Mannum. How far up the Darling it extends,
I am unable to say. It is probably commonest in southern New
South Wales in the Murrumbidgee area, and it is also found

in Victoria following the tributaries of the Murray in a southward
direction.
Description .--A moderately large Broadtail, being only slightly
inferior in size to the two preceding species. The adult male has the
head, underparts, and rump a clear pale yellow, the frontal band is
red, the cheeks, wing margins, and tail are blue, and the mantle
feathers are black edged with pale yellow. The usual black shoulder
patch is present. The adult female has a smaller, rounder head, and
a smaller beak, also the yellow coloration is slightly duller, and there
are invariably a few reddish-orange flecks on the feathers of the throat
and upper breast.
Immatures leave the nest in a plumage which is mainly a pale
yellowish-green, which is lighter on the underparts. They have blue
cheeks and wing margins, and a greenish tail, and the red frontal
band is present. During the first year of life some of the breast
feathers are moulted and replaced by yellower ones, but this change
is relatively imperceptible ; in addition, a variable number of adult
mantle feathers are acquired. Adult plumage is attained at the first
complete moult when the birds are about a year old. Immatures
are easily sexed by the size and shape of the beak and head.
Variations .--No valid variations appear to be recognizable.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's plate in Seth-Smith (p. 160) is really
excellent, and Roland Green's in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 317) is almost
equally good. That in Greene (vol. ii, p. 8) is reasonably good and
almost certainly portrays an adult hen ; even so, the red on the
throat is rather too extensive, as far as can be seen.
Field Notes .--I met with this species in the wild state recently for
the first time, several pairs being observed at Swan Reach, on the
River Murray. It is said seldom to wander far from the eucalypts
which follow the courses of various rivers and creeks which ultimately
flow into the Murray.
Aviary Notes .--This species has always been rare in captivity in
South Australia, and is seldom obtained by the local dealers.
In May, 1936, I obtained a fine adult cock bird, and in January,
1937, I secured a mate for him in the shape of a tame, obviously hand-
reared, hen. This pair were given many opportunities to breed, but
although feeding and mating were often observed in the spring, the
hen never became really interested in the logs provided for her, and
no eggs were ever laid. In 1942, I exchanged the hen for another tame
bird, but without any improvement in results either during that year
or the following. In 1944, I loaned the cock bird to Mr. H. J. Packer,
of Gilberton, who had a hen of the species that had reared hybrids
the previous season when mated with a cock Adelaide ; however,
his hen did not see fit to lay either that year or the next while mated
to my bird. In March, 1946, Mr. Packer returned my bird, having

had the good fortune to catch another cock bird, obviously an escapee,
on his aviaries, and later in that year he succeeded in breeding young
from this bird and his old hen, thus securing the medal of the A.S.S.A.
Meanwhile, my old pair were reunited, and again did no good in
1946, although looking more promising than in previous years, and
after the cock's death in August, 1947, I secured a new pair, which
made no attempt to breed that year. Mr. Packer's pair had mean-
while reared two clutches of young, both in 1946 and 1947, and in
March, 1948, he was kind enough to let me have them. In the
spring they duly went to nest, the first egg of a clutch of six appearing
on 16th October. All the eggs were fertile, and young were first
observed on 12th November ; in all, five hatched and all were reared,
the first leaving the nest on 17th December, and the last on Christmas
Day. The hen laid again almost at once, the second clutch numbering
four. Once again, all the eggs were fertile, and young were seen first
on 30th January. One egg failed to hatch, although it contained
a fully-developed embryo, and of the remaining three, one died when
about ten days old. The remaining two, a pair, were reared, leaving
the nest on 6th and 8th March, 1949.
I have no definite information as to whether this species breeds in
the wild state in its first year of life ; judging by analogy, it would
seem probable that it does so.
(17) Green Rosella (Platycercus caledonicus)
Synonyms. --Yellow-bellied Parrakeet, Tasmanian Rosella, Mountain
Parrot.
Distribution .--Confined to Tasmania, where it is widely distributed,
and to the larger islands of Bass Strait.
Description .--The largest of all the Rosellas, the name Green Rosella
being singularly inappropriate, as there is practically no true green in
its plumage. The head and under-parts of the adult is a rich golden-
olive, the frontal band is red, and the cheeks and wing margins are
blue. The mantle feathers are black with very dark green margins,
and the rump is a dark olive. The sexes of the adults, and also of the
immatures, are easily distinguished in that the head especially, and
also the beak are very much larger in the male than in the female,
although the general colouring of the latter is only slightly duller.
Immatures differ in that the head and underparts are considerably
greener and the back feathers are dull green with practically no
evidence of the scalloping seen in the adult. As with the already
described members of this genus, adult plumage is obtained at the
first full moult, which is completed when the birds are about fifteen
months old. During the first winter, some of the breast feathers are

moulted and replaced by yellower ones, and a few adult mantle
feathers may appear.
Variations. --The birds from King Island ( henriettae) are said to
have more red on the head and to have the subcaudals strongly tinged
with red. Though I have seen birds exhibiting this variation on several
occasions, I have never been able to discover their origin with certainty,
although I always suspected they had come from Tasmania itself,
in which case the subspecies is probably not valid.
Coloured Plates. --Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 322)
figures a pair of the King Island birds, and is an excellent repre-
sentation of that variation. The only other readily accessible plate
that I am aware of is the reproduction of Gould's original plate in
Tropical Birds (pi. 8), which is very good of the typical race, although
the bird in the hollow, which looks like a cock, shows an unusual
red flecking on the throat, rather reminiscent of a hen Yellow Rosella.
Field Notes. --Although I have visited Tasmania on two occasions,
I was never fortunate enough to see this bird in the wild state, although
it is said to be quite common in many parts of the island. Sharland
in Tasmanian Birds , states that it is well distributed, especially in fruit-
growing areas, also in thick forest country and on the mountains.
Aviary Notes. --Although frequently seen in dealers hands prior to
World War II, it is now extremely rare in this state, and I am practi-
cally sure that my pair are the only birds in captivity here at present.
In pre-war days it was usually available from Melbourne dealers also.
My first hen was obtained in August, 1936, and was then in immature
plumage ; she had attained adult plumage by February, 1937, and
was mated with three different cocks, but never showed any particular
inclination to go to nest. Just prior to the 1942 breeding season
I obtained a new pair, but these were never at all friendly, and early
in 1944 the cock lost his heart to a one-legged hen Red-vented Blue
Bonnet which had escaped and had remained in the garden. In
June, 1944, a new hen, said to be aviary-bred, was obtained from
Melbourne, and though the Blue Bonnet was caught and disposed
of, the cock would not be consoled, and would have nothing to do
with the hen either that season or the following ; in fact, he remained
unmated for the rest of his days. In March, 1946, I obtained a new
cock, and although he tolerated the hen, he was never very keen on
her, and when he fell violently in love with another Broadtail hen in
the next aviary, I thought it desirable to make yet another change.
The new cock was obtained early in October, and immediately seemed
pleased with his mate who responded to his attentions and laid the
first egg of a&amp;apos;clutch of four on 6th November. All the eggs were
fertile, and two young were seen on 30th November, and a third a few
days later, the fourth egg having disappeared. The third chick only
lived a few days, but the others flourished until 23rd December, a very

hot day, when they were found dead in the nest, with full crops.
This was particularly disappointing as other Broadtail young of the
same age survived the heat. The father of these chicks died in the
autumn of 1947, and a new cock obtained subsequently seemed no
keener on the hen than all but one of his predecessors had been, and
no results were obtained that season. In 1948, although the pair were
not actively hostile towards one another, neither feeding nor mating
had been noted, and it was therefore somewhat of a surprise when
the hen laid the first of a clutch of five on 15th November. Unfortu-
nately, these eggs were all infertile, and were replaced by two fertile
Adelaide Rosella eggs which the hen deserted a few days before they
were due to hatch.
The only record that I have of this species being bred in captivity
in South Australia is that of Mr. F. Lewitzka, who gained the medal
of the A.S.S.A. in 1938, rearing three good young birds which left
the nest in mid-December of that year.
Green Rosellas look very handsome when they have recently
completed their moult, but towards the end of the year they frequently
begin to look very ragged, and the breast shows an untidy appearance
due to the dark bases of some of the yellow feathers becoming visible
in an irregular pattern. Although I can find no positive information
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.4767936" page_id="56311904"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
on the subject, I would think it highly likely that this species will breed
when less than a year old and whilst still in immature plumage.
(18) Pale-headed Rosella (Platycercus adscitus)
Synonyms .--Mealy Rosella, Moreton Bay Rosella, Blue Rosella,
Blue-cheeked Parrakeet (the northern race).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.975448625" page_id="56311904"  page_num="170" year="" vol="">
Distribution .--The range of this bird is from Gape York Peninsula
in North Queensland down the whole of the eastern part of Queens-
land into north-eastern New South Wales, where its southern limit
does not appear to have been defined.
Description .--A medium-sized Broadtail with a yellow head, white
cheeks with blue lower margins, blue breast and abdomen, and red
subcaudals. The mantle feathers are black edged with bright yellow,
the rump is a greyish blue, the wing margins are blue, and there is
the usual black shoulder patch. The sexes are very alike, but some
males have a very much more vivid blue breast than others, whilst
in all females the breast is rather a greyish blue. The size and shape
of the head and beak is a help in sexing, but is not as reliable in this
species as in many other Broadtails. Immatures leave the nest as
duller editions of the adults in every respect. There is often some red or
grey feathers on the head and the amount of red may increase with the
first partial moult which takes place when the birds are a few months

old ; I have been unable to convince myself that this red or grey
feathering is a sexual distinction. Full plumage is acquired rather
gradually and is not complete until the first full moult at the age
of about fifteen months.
Variations .--Whilst considerable individual variation occurs amongst
birds of this species, particularly in the immatures as already indicated,
the birds from the northern extremity of the range, originally described
as the Blue-cheeked Parrakeet (amathusiae ), are very distinct and
possibly deserve specific rank. They are smaller birds with more
blue and less white on the cheeks, and with a pale yellow area across
the chest. I have not seen this variety in life, but skins show the
difference very clearly.
Coloured Plates .--Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 338)
is a really excellent representation of the two varieties. Cayley's
plate in The Emu (vol. 30, pi. 14), also portrays both varieties very
adequately. The figure in Greene (vol. ii, p. 6) is quite fair although
the blue is too bright.
Field Notes .--I have frequently observed this bird in the vicinity of
Brisbane, and in other areas in Southern Queensland. It is usually
to be seen in pairs or in small flocks. In habits, it resembles the other
Rosellas, and is often to be seen feeding on the ground. A pair nested
in a hollow spout of a tree growing alongside the operating theatre of
the army hospital to which I was attached in 1943.
Aviary Notes .--A well-known aviary bird, but one which has a bad
reputation for delicacy when first purchased, probably only on
account of the deplorable conditions under which newly-trapped birds
are frequently kept and boxed. My early experience with this species
was in accord with the above and about half a dozen trapped birds
survived only a relatively short time.
An acclimatized hen obtained in January, 1937, proved a much
better proposition and went to nest late in September of that year,
laying eight eggs, the first two of which were broken. Though she
incubated steadily all the eggs proved clear, and this tended to confirm
the doubt which had always existed in my mind in regard to the sex
of her alleged mate. In the following year a definite cock was not
obtained until late in September, and no nesting took place. In 1939,
however, a clutch of six eggs was laid in August, three of which were
fertile. One young bird was seen on 13th September and another the
next day, the third fertile egg failing to hatch. Both these birds
died when just over a week old. A second clutch, on this occasion
consisting of four eggs, was commenced on 17th October ; one egg
was broken, another was clear, the third failed to hatch, and the
fourth hatched on 14th November, and the young bird, a hen, was
reared and left the nest on 13th December.
In 1940, this young bird was mated to a very fine cock, obviously

an escapee, that had been caught on the aviaries during the previous
year. She commenced a clutch of six eggs in late September, when just
nine months old, but these were all infertile. The next two years'
clutches of eight and nine eggs produced no results, and in 1943 a log
was not even provided. In 1944, a clutch of eight was commenced on
11 th August, incubation proceeded steadily and young were first seen
on 15th September. In all, five hatched, two eggs being clear and the
other containing a half-grown embryo. The five were all reared,
leaving the nest between 19th and 26th October. As the hen laid an
egg on the ground on 1st November, I replaced the log, and a further
four eggs were laid therein and incubated until the hen suddenly
started to moult and deserted ; on examination, all the eggs were
found to contain half-developed embryos. In 1945, the same pair
experienced a series of misfortunes. The first clutch of five was com-
menced in mid-August, but the eggs were spoilt by the nesting material
all falling out of the log ; a second clutch of five commenced towards
the end of September met with a similar fate. When a new log was pro-
vided, a third clutch was begun on 31st October. On this occasion six
eggs were laid and the first young bird was seen on 29th November ; in
all four hatched, but one died during the first week. The other three
flourished until Christmas time, when they all succumbed during a
spell of very hot weather, though they were within a week of leaving
the nest. The following season (1946) a clutch of eight was begun
early in August, and although the first two were broken, five of the
remaining six proved fertile and four had hatched on 9th September,
and the fifth a couple of days later. One of these died in the first week
but the remaining four were reared and left the nest between 11 th and
15th October. A second clutch of five was started on 27th October
and all had hatched by 26th November ; once again, one died early,
and the remainder were reared and left the nest about Christmas time.
I see from my notes that I thought at first that probably seven of these
eight were hens ; actually only five proved to be, but this serves to
illustrate the difficulty which can be experienced in sexing this species,
both in the immature and in the adult stage. In 1947 the hen died
egg-bound in September, having started the clutch with a soft-shelled
egg and then producing four satisfactory ones. A new hen was
obtained a week later and she went to nest early in October, but her
four eggs were all clear. She laid a second clutch of five in mid-
November, three of which were good. Young could be heard early in
December, and two were later seen, but they only survived a few days,
the other fertile egg having failed to hatch. In 1948 the old cock died
during the winter and a new one was obtained in time for the breeding
season. A clutch of four, of which only two were fertile, was laid late
in August. Only one of these hatched and it was deserted by its
parents when about a fortnight old. A second clutch, of five, was

started on 20th October, four proved fertile and young were seen on
18th November ; eventually three were counted, but one died when
quite young and the other two, both hens, were reared and left the
nest just before Christmas. A third clutch was laid, and two young
were seen on 30th January ; one of these died when very young and
the other survived until mid-February.
This species has been bred in captivity in South Australia on a fair
number of occasions, the first recorded being that of Mr. U. F. Coneen,
who was awarded the A.S.S.A. medal in 1937.
In the United States this species appears to be practically domesti-
cated ; at any rate, it is said to be the commonest of all the Broad-
tails in that country.
(19) Northern Rosella [Platycercus venustus)
Synonyms. --Brown's Parrakeet, Smutty Rosella.
Distribution. --This bird has only been recorded from the Kimberley
division of Western Australia and from the northern parts of the
Northern Territory.
Description. --Apart from the Western Rosella, this species is the
smallest of the Broadtails. The plumage pattern is both striking and
unusual, and consists of a black head, cheeks which are white in their
upper part and blue in their lower, under parts pale yellow with fine
black edges to the feathers and scarlet subcaudals. The mantle is black
edged with pale yellow, the rump is also pale yellow and the wing
margins are blue, and there is the usual black shoulder patch. Adults
of both sexes are remarkably alike in colouring and the hen is usually
only very slightly duller than the cock. The size and shape of the head
and beak is a help in some examples, but quite a number of birds are
seen which are extremely difficult to sex. The immatures leave the
nest as duller replicas of the adults with all the colours less vivid and less
clearly defined ; they, too, can be extremely hard to sex in some
instances. Assumption of adult plumage is a gradual and not very
noticeable process and appears to take about a year to be completed.
Variations. --No valid subspecies have been shown to exist, but
individuals vary considerably. Some red feathers scattered through
the black of the head are not very uncommon, and one occasionally
sees examples with a broad band of scarlet running up the centre of the
abdomen.
Coloured Plates. --Goodchild's plate of a pair in Seth-Smith (p. 168)
is extraordinarily lifelike, and Boosey's picture in Tavistock (frontis-
piece) is also quite good. Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi,

p. 345) gives both birds rather a ruffled appearance, though the actual
colouring is quite accurate.
Field Notes .--This is a species that I have not had an opportunity of
observing in its natural state. It does not appear to be a common bird
anywhere, and is said to be usually met with in pairs or small parties.
Aviary Notes .--Always a rare bird in captivity and one which appeals
to most Parrot lovers, even though they may be unattracted by the
majority of the larger of the Broadtails.
I obtained my first example of this species, a hen, from the late
Mr. Wachsmann, of Sydney, in January, 1936, but this bird only
survived a couple of months in my collection. Later in the same year,
the same gentleman was good enough to let me have a pair of these
birds. However, the cock bird never liked his mate and always seemed
to be attracted by every other hen broadtail in sight until he died
suddenly late in 1937. In March of the following year I was fortunate
enough to obtain a new cock, and the pair seemed to be satisfactorily
mated from the start. The first egg of a clutch of five was laid on
8th August and four of the eggs were fertile. The first young bird was
hatched on 3rd September and two more emerged within the next
couple of days, but one did not survive long ; the other two flourished
until 16th September, when they were found dead in the nest, and
thereafter both parents immediately started a heavy moult. In 1939,
a clutch of four eggs was started on 16th August ; of these, three were
fertile and young were first observed on 13th September. All these
flourished and two left the nest on 14th October, and the third the
next day, all being fine specimens. I was extremely uncertain in
regard to the sexes of these birds at first, but they eventually turned
out to be two hens and a cock. This success gained the medal of the
A.S.S.A., being the first breeding by a member, although the species
had been bred in the Adelaide Zoo prior to this. In 1940, the first
clutch consisted of three fertile eggs laid in mid-June ; three young
hatched early in July, but only one survived to leave the nest on 12th
August. A second clutch was laid later in that month, but all the eggs
were clear, and shortly afterwards the old pair were killed by a pair
of Twenty-eights when the latter bit a hole in the wire dividing their
adjacent flights, and entered their cage.
For some years thereafter the species was not represented in my
collection, and it was not until 1945 that I obtained the loan of a pair
which were said to have laid numerous clutches of eggs which had
always been infertile, probably because the cock was almost devoid
of toes as a result of fighting. True to form, a clutch of four was laid
in May of that year and incubated steadily without result. The
following year clutches of three and four were laid in March and
August respectively, without any improvement in results. In January,
1947, I succeeded in obtaining a fine new cock bird, but the hen

expressed her disapproval of the arrangement by not even laying that
year ! In September, I loaned the cock to an acquaintance who had
an unmated hen and the old hen was restored to her former mate to
the undisguised joy of both ! Early in 1948, I obtained a pair of the
progeny of my loaned cock bird, but one did not survive long, and at
the time of writing I now have the hen of this pair and a recently
received aviary-bred cock that have settled down well together.
Northern Rosellas are early breeders and whilst they do not always
have an autumn nest like Hooded Parrakeets usually do, they almost
invariably commence nesting operations in mid or late winter. This
peculiarity in not adapting themselves to the seasons has been a great
trial to overseas aviculturists, but does not appear to be a disadvantage
locally.
(20) Eastern Rosella (.Platycercus eximius)
Synonyms .---Red Rosella, Rosehill Parrakeet, Golden-mantled
Rosella (the northern subspecies).
Distribution .--From southern Queensland, where the northernmost
limit of its range appears to be unrecorded, through eastern New
South Wales and most of Victoria, apart from the Mallee belt, into the
south-eastern portion of South Australia, where it extends as far north
as Tintinara. A small isolated colony is also to be found in the Adelaide
hills, but there is some doubt as to whether these may have been
introduced. The species is also found in Tasmania, but apparently
does not occur on the Bass Strait islands. It has been introduced
into New Zealand.
Description .---A medium-sized Broadtail with extremely gaudy colour-
ing. The head and upper breast and under tail coverts are scarlet,
the cheeks are white, the lower breast is yellow, and the abdomen and
rump are pale yellowish green. The mantle feathers are black edged
with yellowish green, the wing margins are blue, and the shoulder
patch is black. Hens are usually somewhat duller than cocks, but
occasionally very bright ones are seen, and these may easily be mistaken
for cocks, particularly as the size and shape of the head and beak is not
very helpful in this species. However, white spots on the flight feathers
appear to be very constant in hens of this species and absent in adult
cocks. Immatures leave the nest with all the colours duller, and the red
of the head replaced to a considerable extent by green. Particularly is
this so in the case of young hens, so that immatures are usually easier
to sex than adults. More red feathers are acquired in the first autumn
and winter, but full plumage is not assumed till the first complete
moult at the age of a little over a year.

Rosella ( splendidus ) is sufficiently distinct to warrant its being regarded
as a species by many authorities. It differs from the typical bird in
having the margins of the mantle feathers golden yellow instead of
yellowish green, the rump sea-green rather than yellowish green, and
the red of the head more of a vermilion shade. This race is found in
southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, where it comes
as far south as Scone. At Muswellbrook, to the south of Scone, the
typical bird ( eximius ) is found, and the same holds good at Merriwa
and Gobbora to the west ; in fact, the range of the Golden-mantled
bird is roughly limited in a westerly direction by the old New South
Wales-Queensland railway. The Tasmanian birds ( diemenensis)
appear to be distinguishable by their larger size and the greater extent
of the white cheek patches.
Coloured Plates. --Gronvold's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 352) is an
excellent representation of a male of the golden-mantled variety.
Greene's plate (vol. ii, frontispiece) is quite an adequate portrayal of
the same subspecies. The pair which are displayed on the dust-cover
of Cayley's Australian Parrots are perhaps the best, easily accessible,
representation of the typical birds.
Field Notes. --The typical birds are common in most parts of Victoria
and in the south-east of South Australia, and seem to favour open,
timbered country. I have also observed the golden-mantled race in the
vicinity of Toowoomba and Warwick, Queensland. As with all the
Rosellas, they are usually seen in pairs or small flocks.
Aviary Notes. --Probably the best known of all the Australian Parrots
and very commonly kept as a cage bird in Victoria and New South
Wales, many hand-reared birds making good whistlers. A showy bird
in a mixed collection, but no less pugnacious than any of the rest of
the group.
Although the species was practically continuously represented in my
collection, it was not until 1946 that I possessed sufficient breeding
aviaries to warrant devoting space to these relatively common birds.
In that year I had a cock Golden-mantled that I had brought back
from Queensland in 1943, and a hen of the common variety obtained
from a local bird shop. The first egg of a clutch of six was laid on
3rd September, but although the hen sat closely, all the eggs proved
clear and were removed towards the end of the month. The hen soon
went to nest again, eggs being seen under the sitting bird on 15th
October. This time the clutch consisted of five, of which only two were
fertile. Two young birds were seen during the first week of November
and the first, a hen, left the nest rather prematurely on 2nd December
and was replaced ; the other, a cock, made its first appearance on 5th
December, and the hen reappeared in much better shape, the next
day. On leaving the nest, these birds could scarcely be distinguished
from typical young Eastern Rosellas, but when they assumed adult

plumage, they were more or less intermediate between the two races
in colouring. In 1947 the hen died and another pair of typical Easterns
did nothing. The old cock Golden-mantled was mated to a young
Golden-mantled hen obtained late in the previous year. This pair
were seen feeding on many occasions *in September and October, but
did not get any further.
In 1948, yet another pair of the common race were tried and the
first of five eggs was laid on 3rd October. Young were seen on the
last day of the same month and eventually five were counted ; the
first left the nest on 27th November, and by 4th December all five had
left it, but they all exhibited the unusual habit of returning to it for
several days thereafter. This clutch consisted of four hens and one
cock.
Towards the end of 1947 I had been lucky enough to secure a pair
of Golden-mantleds which had laid two clutches of eggs that season
while in the possession of Mr. H. J. Packer, of Gilberton, but had been
disturbed on each occasion. In 1948 the hen of this pair laid the
first of a clutch of four on 25th September ; all proved fertile, and
young were first seen on 23rd October, and all were successfully
reared, leaving the nest between 23rd and 25th November. Of these,
two were obviously hens and another equally obviously a cock, but
the fourth, which eventually turned out a hen, was much brighter
than her two sisters and was thought to be a cock for a long time.
The hen appeared likely to lay again, but was found dead in the log
early in December, possibly as a result of egg-binding.
The A.S.S.A. did not see fit to grant a medal for the breeding of the
Eastern Rosella, four members, Messrs. S. Harvey, V. J. Duignan,
E. B. Cox, and Mrs. D. K. Isaacson having achieved almost simul-
taneous success in 1934. The above-mentioned breeding of the
Golden-mantled race was the first on record and gained a medal.
(21) Western Rosella (Platycercus icterotis)
Synonyms .--Stanley Rosella, Yellow-cheeked Parrakeet.
Distribution .--Confined to the south-western corner of Western
Australia and not extending farther north or east of a line running
through Moora, Wongan Hills, and Merredin. Further south it has
not been recorded east of Dundas.
Description .---Easily the smallest of the Rosellas and quite unique
in its genus on account of the dissimilarity of the sexes, a feature which
has been overlooked to a greater or lesser degree in most ornithological
works. In the typical race, the adult male has the head and under
parts bright scarlet, the cheek patches bright yellow, and the rump
green. The mantle feathers are black edged with green and a variable,
often quite inconspicuous, amount of red, the wing margins are blue,

and there is the characteristic black shoulder patch. The adult female
is considerably duller than the male, having the scarlet replaced by
brick-red which has a large amount of greenish olive mixed with it.
Immatures resemble the adult female, but show more green and less
red in the plumage and they entirely lack the yellow cheek patches,
unlike all other immature Rosellas ; also, the mantle feathers are
green without the black centres. Young birds are not easy to sex as in
this species there is relatively little difference in the size and shape of
the head and beak. During the first autumn and winter some of the
green feathers on the head and breast are replaced by red ones, and a
few yellow cheek feathers appear and at about this stage young males
can be more easily picked out. Full adult plumage is not achieved
till the birds are about fourteen months old, when a fairly rapid
complete moult takes place.
Variations. --The inland birds ( xanthogenys ) differ considerably from
the more commonly seen coastal race. The adult male has the red
colouring of a duller, rather brickish hue, the cheeks are a paler
yellow, the mantle feathers are edged with pale red and show no green,
and the green of the rump is much duller. Adult females of this race
are not as green as the typical birds and approach the male colouring
more nearly. In fact, both sexes of this race are not unlike very small
Adelaide Rosellas with pale yellow instead of blue cheeks.
Coloured Plates. --This species has been figured relatively seldom
and the only female portrayed, as far as I am aware, is in Gould.
Roland Green's plate in Mathews (vol. vi, p. 329) is a splendid repre-
sentation of an adult male of each race, and there is also an excellent
plate of a male of the inland race (. xanthogenys ) by Keulemans in the
Catalogue of the Birds of the British Museum (vol. xx).
Field Notes. --I observed the coastal race of this bird on a good many
occasions during a tour of the south-west of Western Australia in
August, 1948. They were seen in pairs and small flocks, the latter
consisting mainly of young birds. Near Kojonup I thought I caught a
fleeting glimpse of a pair of the inland race.
Aviary Notes. --One of the most popular of the Broadtails on account
of its relatively small size and the ease with which it can be bred. In a
mixed collection it is perhaps the least quarrelsome of all the Rosellas.
From 1936 onwards I possessed a pair which consisted of a male of
the common race and an elderly female of the inland sub-species. This
hen was fed by the cock each spring and spent a good deal of time
ejecting the rotten wood from the nesting logs provided for her, but
as far as I am aware, she never laid. A new pair were obtained
towards the end of 1942 and the following season a clutch of eggs
was laid, and although the cock died shortly afterwards, the hen carried
on single-handed and reared three fine youngsters, a cock and two
hens. It was not until September of 1944, that I was able to secure a

new mate for this hen ; when introduced she appeared anxious to go
to nest immediately, and laid the first egg of a clutch of eight on
26th September. All the eggs were fertile and young were first observed
on 24th October; eventually it was seen that six had hatched, the
other two eggs failing to do so although containing fully-developed
embryos. All the young were reared, leaving the nest between 28th
November and 5th December, and all were good specimens, except
the youngest, which was a little on the small side. Early the following
year the hen met with an accidental death and the young bird kept
as a mate for the father turned out to be a cock. A new hen was not
obtained until after the breeding season was over, and in 1946 feeding
was noted in September, and in October the hen spent a lot of time
in the log, but no eggs were ever seen and she was found dead in the
nest in mid-November. For the 1947 season a new pair was obtained,
and although the cock apparently pulled his upper mandible off in
September in trying to disentangle his foot from the wire door catch,
he recovered and was seen feeding his mate early in November, and
the first of four eggs was laid on 20th of that month ; all were fertile
and duly hatched, but one died within the first week. The first two
of the survivors left the nest on 13th January, and the third, very
prematurely, two days later ; ultimately, this bird developed into a
good specimen. In 1948 one of the young cocks of this clutch was
mated with his mother, and although he was still in juvenile plumage,
two eggs out of the clutch of five commenced on 31st October proved
fertile. Two young were seen late in November, and the smaller was
found dead in the log on 20th December, the parents having inexplic-
ably ceased feeding. The other young bird left the nest somewhat
prematurely that day, but fared no better, and died a few days later.
As the parent birds did not start their moult for several weeks after-
wards, their sudden desertion was all the more difficult to fathom.
The A.S.S.A. medal for the first breeding of this species was awarded
in 1936 to Mr. H. J. Packer, of Gilberton. Since that date it has been
bred by a fair number of aviculturists in this state.
I have always felt that this species formed a link between the
Rosellas and the Many-colours and Red-rumps, partly because of the
marked difference in the plumage of the sexes, and also on account
of the call notes which are soft and melodious and quite unlike the
relatively harsh notes of most of the other members of the genus.

RINGING SCHEME FOR WATERFOWL
RINGING SCHEME FOR WATERFOWL

<bodyText confidence="0.989246558823529" page_id="56311914"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
In response to many requests the Avicultural Society has decided
to institute a scheme for the ringing of waterfowl kept in captivity,
as quite distinct from the various schemes for ringing wild birds
which are in operation in many countries.
The rings are primarily intended for use on either full-winged or
feather-clipped birds, but can also be used on pinioned birds for
purposes of records of pedigrees.
As it is essential for the efficient working of the scheme that the
rings should bear a well-known address to which reports can be sent,
the Zoological Society of London has kindly consented to allow the
Avicultural Society to use their address for this purpose. The rings
are therefore engraved with a serial number and the words " Return
A.S. c/o Zoo, London ".
The rings are coloured blue in order that escaped birds may be
distinguished at a distance and, it is hoped, thereby obviate their
being shot. In addition, the scheme should be of help in tracing lost
birds, and be a means of keeping a record of pedigrees. So far as
Great Britain is concerned, the scheme should do much to reduce the
uncertainty regarding reports of rare ducks observed, for in the past
doubt has frequently been felt as to whether the birds in question are
escapes or genuine new records for this country.
It is hoped that all those who keep waterfowl will co-operate in the
scheme, and in order to give every encouragement for their wide use
the rings are being sold at cost price, the Society bearing all cost of
administration, record slips, etc.
The rings are at present available for geese and ducks only, and
can be obtained in the following sizes :--
Size 2/3 for Teal . . . Price 2s. 3 d. per dozen, post free.
Size 3 for Wigeon . . Price 2 s. 3 d. per dozen, post free.
Size 4 for Mallard, Pintail, etc. Price 2 s. 6 d. per dozen, post free.
Size 5 for Geese . . . Price 2 s. g d. per dozen, post free.
The scheme is not confined to Great Britain alone and the rings
are available to aviculturists of any country.
Requests for rings should be addressed to the Hon. Secretary,

In the April, 1939, issue of this Magazine, I gave an account of a
hybrid Heron reared in Japan. It is therefore of interest to record
another hybrid Heron between the Eastern Great White Egret,
Egretta alba modesta , which breeds in Japan, and the Philippine Night
Heron, Nycticorax caledonicus manillensis from Basilan, the Philippines,
which was raised in Uyeno Zoo, Tokyo.
In 1929, a Night Heron was put into a large flying cage with an
assortment of waterfowl, and a few years later an Egret was intro-
duced ; no other Herons were in this aviary. They mated in the Spring
of 1939, and built a nest at the highest place of the cage. The eggs
hatched 12 th June, and about a month later three young happily left
the nest. Through observations during nidification, observers agreed
that the Night Heron is the male and the Egret the female.
It is of great interest to see the stage of growth, because both
parents are totally different in shape, size, and colour, the Egret
being very large and slender with immaculate white plumage, while
the Night Heron is small and roundish in stature, having a spotted
plumage in the young and plain roufous with black head in the adult.
The general shape of the hybrids is very much like the Egret. They
stand tall and keep their necks erect. Their bills are narrower and
sharper than the Night Heron's, but when watching for fish they
assume the crouching attitude of the latter species. In the autumn
of 1939 the general plumage of the young was light brownish-grey,
heavily spotted with white ; that is to say that they were like young
caledonicus , only lighter. During the course of the second year the
colour gradually became paler and the maculation disappeared.
Finally in the spring of 1941, their third year, they assumed a complete
adult plumage. The colour at this stage is warm grey on the upper
parts, paler below, with faint irregular streaks along the neck. They
lack the nuptial train of the Egret during the summer months, but
assume throughout the year a pair of long ornamental plumes hanging
from the hind head, characteristic of the Night Heron. However,
the plumes are much shorter than in the Night Heron and reach
only to the upper neck, about the same proportion as in the Little
Egret. The colour of these plumes is a stained white. The general
shape of the head is more like the Egret, the bill much more slender
than in the Night Heron, and the eyes are normal sized like the
Egret. On the whole this hybrid, in its shape, size, and colour reminds
me of a young Grey Heron in every respect, even in the shape of the
bill, except that its general colour is slightly more buffy or pale
cinnamon rather than grey. Two of the three hybrids died within

NOTES ON A FEW AFRICAN BIRDS

Having just returned from a three months' tour in South Africa,
during which time I motored over ten thousand miles, I hoped to
write an interesting article on the birds for the Magazine. I must
start by saying that I have, on the whole, been disappointed at the
number and variety that I was able to identify. I carried with me
Dr. Leonard Gill's book on South African birds which was my vade
mecum during the whole trip, and without which I should have been
at a complete loss, except for a few unmistakables of pre-war importa-
tion.
Starting at the Victoria Falls, the first birds that presented them-
selves in numbers were Layard's Bul-buls and Pied Wagtails. The
former, rather larger and not quite so attractive as the red-vented
species of the East, were very much in evidence, the Wagtails, tame
and confiding as they usually are. In the " Rain Forest " in front of
the Falls were Red-billed Hornbills and Trumpeter Hornbills, the
latter very ugly and grotesque looking, not to say alarming, when they
suddenly give vent to an ear-piercing blow on their trumpet from
a leafy perch. It was very amusing to watch them picking small berries
off a tree, which they swallowed whole in large quantities. I also saw
the Yellow-billed Hornbill, and later, while in the Kruger National
Park, had the good fortune to see a good pair of Ground Hornbills,
feeding in the early morning, on the sunny slope of a kopje. These
are also exceedingly ugly and awkward creatures when compared
with the little sparkling gems of Sunbirds noted further south.
The two most common birds to be seen in South Africa, as far as
I could judge, are the Red-winged Glossy Starling and the Shrikes of
different kinds. Of the latter, the one I saw most of was the Fiscal
Shrike : quite a handsome fellow in black and greyish white. The said
Starlings are met everywhere in small flocks. They seem to build
mostly in rocky ground, of which there is plenty, high up in cliffs on
mountains, both inland and around the sea coast. They are attractive
birds to my mind, beautifully iridescent with a bright russet under-
wing, which only shows when flying. I imagined they would make
nice pets, and they sing quite well, and have a beautiful mellow call
note. I saw several of another kind, which I should have called Mynahs,
but there they are classed as " Pied Starlings ".
Travelling for ten thousand miles one passes through a lot of very

barren country, positively arid, without a tree to be seen. An
astonishing sight in these parts are the numerous nests which are built
on the completely exposed struts of the telephone poles ! More than
one kind of bird seems to take advantage of these substitute trees !
Although the nests were not by any means all inhabited, I saw one
with a Dove sitting hopefully upon it. As it is often very windy in these
open spaces it must take a great deal of patience to establish the
foundations of the abode. In fact it is quite an amazing sight !
My first sight of a pair of Greater Double-collared Sunbirds was in
the semi-tropical garden of the Mountain Inn, a few miles south of
Louis-Trichardt, in the Transvaal. I went out early before the dew
had departed from the flowers and the sight of the little gems sparkling
in the sunlight provided a thrill not likely to be forgotten.
From Bulawayo I motored out to the Matopos to see the grave of
Cecil Rhodes, so impressively placed upon the crest of an enormous
boulder. When having tea on the stoep of the small inn en route I was
charmed to see a pair of Namaqua Doves. Most fascinating of all the
species, and just about one-third of the size of an ordinary Turtle Dove,
with long pointed tails. They reminded me forcibly of the Australian
Grass Finches that I used to breed.
One day, with good luck, I spied a fine pair of Secretary Birds
stalking along in an open space in the bush. I watched them for
some time through field glasses till some natives appeared from the
rear and startled them. After looking around in a supercilious way
they ran forward to gain momentum, rose slowly, and flapped away.
It was indeed a treat to see such curiosities in their own surroundings,
in contrast to the wretched single and somewhat bedraggled specimens
to be seen in European Zoos.
During the drive from the north southwards, especially, I think,
in Natal, I saw literally hundreds of what they call " Long-tailed
Widow Birds ". The term " Widow ", I take it, being synonymous
with " Whydah ". These are a kind of Weaver bird which build
among the grasses of swamps. There was neither time nor opportunity
to investigate for nests, but they must have been in season, as the cocks,
resplendent in their nuptial garb of black and orange, with tails from
fifteen to eighteen inches long fluttering in the breeze, hovered over
the swamps or sat on the fences and telegraph wires. They were to
be seen in stretches of country where no other birds were showing,
except perhaps a very common kind of Buzzard which were also fond
of resting upon the telephone poles, as being the only available perch
for the sole of their foot.
In the Drakensberg Mountains I again saw a Double-collared
Sunbird cock feeding on nectar from a protea flower, and sparkling in
the sun. It was there I saw the first Sacred Ibis, of which I saw a good
many further south.

In the estuary of the River Umvolosi, at St. Lucia Bay, I was
intrigued by three Flamingoes feeding in the slush. I think they are
quite the quaintest birds alive. Keeping always equidistant with their
long necks outstretched downwards and their bills turned upside down
in the mud. They all decided to go to sleep at once and stood immobile,
equally spaced out, on one leg. They breed further up the estuary,
presumably on an island. At the time of my visit the breeding season
was on but one was not encouraged to go and see them, which was
a disappointment as it was one of the sights I had much wished to have.
On one occasion I happened to see a specimen of that strange bird
the Hamerkop. These are not very shy although they slink along as
though they were ashamed of themselves ; something in the nature
of a Landrail. They are strange birds, classed by themselves, and
seem to have no definite place in the order of things. I was fortunate
to come on a specimen walking round a small pond by the roadside.
This was in the vicinity of Outshoorn where there are large Ostrich
farms, and I saw innumerable Ostriches grazing in the fields, like, or
along with, cattle. They are very inquisitive and when the car stopped
several came up to peer in to see if there was anything edible going,
because the fields where they were were absolutely parched and lifeless
and covered, within reach of the road, with dry powdery dust. In
spite of this, the poor things cropped at every available blade, swallowing
dust and all regardless. They are really very droll to watch. Talking
of Ostriches, there was a very amusing scene one afternoon on the
coast of the Gape Point Game Reserve. A party of fishermen were
hauling in a large net teeming with silvery fish of about one to two
pounds weight. So heavy was the catch that the net could not be
brought ashore for fear of breaking and the men decided to leave it
in the water till the tide receded. They therefore tied it up and started
mending the holes for fear the fish would escape. Every now and
then they pulled a fish through a hole, and threw it up on the beach.
A pair of semi-tame Ostriches sauntered down and stood eyeing the
performance, and when the men withdrew to look to their basket
some way off, the pair approached very cautiously and began to peck
at the still gasping fish on the sand. Whether they would have actually
eaten bits of them or not I do not know, but suddenly one of the men,
catching sight of the thieves, came rushing towards them yelling out
and throwing stones, whereat the Ostriches turned and ran trying their
best to look dignified at the same time. On this occasion they did not
wait to hide their heads in the sand !
Round about the Falls and the Kruger Game Reserve, my attention
was arrested by curious cries or call notes which I had no means of
identifying without seeing the operator. In connection with this I was
very much amused by one of the Lesser Bustard tribe, the Black
Khorhan, which stood on the top of an anthill emitting a series of

loud clicks such as it was difficult to believe could come from a bird
about the size of a Capercailzie hen. Another bird of those regions
with a loud peculiar cry was the Grey Lourie or " Go-away bird ", of
which I heard and saw a few. I also saw a specimen of the Knysa
Lourie, which is much more handsome, with his green, red, and blue
plumage.
One day I got a good view of a fine pair of Hoopoes, and a single one
on another occasion. These are somewhat brighter in colour than
those frequenting the more northerly zones, such as Egypt.
Weaver birds colonies turn up in unexpected as well as expected
places. Between the Falls and Gape Point I met various kinds ;
Masked, Gape Weavers, Yellow Bishops, and Orange Bishops ; the
latter I came across at a very high elevation. Both the Yellow and
Orange were hanging about swampy ground, and I suppose they
were nesting, as the cocks were in full dress.
The Botanical Gardens at Kirstenbosch near Gape Town supplies
one of the best fields of observation, especially if one happens to be
there at the right season for the flowers. I was too late for most of
them but there were still a considerable number of Protea bushes in
full bloom and these flowers supply the nectar for Sunbirds and
Sugarbirds. The latter are fully represented there by the " long-tailed "
species, of which I saw several. I have not heard of these in England
and presume that they were not imported, as their plumage is quite
dull green, more like the females of some of the bright varieties. Never-
theless they are very attractive and really sing remarkably well,
chiefly inside a bush. Their tails are about twelve inches long in the
breeding season and look rather embarrassing. Also at Kirstenbosch
I had a good close-up view of a pair of Mousebirds. These are very
peculiar little things and seem rather aloof. They are put in a class
by themselves in the books, as they do not fit into any other group.
The ones I saw were a pretty soft dun colour and were supposed to
have red legs and feet and, I think, eyes, but I cannot say that I dis-
tinguished that although I had my glasses on them. On their heads
they have a stiff triangular tuft which is always held upright, and a long
stiff tail. I felt I would love to possess a pair. I do not know whether
they sing, I fancy not, but they have a harsh call.
One day, with a stroke of luck, I caught sight of a pair of Malachite
Sunbirds in a small village on the coast of Gape Province which struck
me as an unexpected place to see such treasures. They were sucking
nectar on a high tree. I only saw one more of these, the chief reason
being that it was the very dry season, and flowers of any sort were not
rampant.
In the forest above Kirstenbosch I caught sight of a fascinating pair
of Cape Flycatchers. These are very bright little birds more in the
nature of a Tit than one's idea of a Flycatcher. They are shy and rather

confined to high trees. Talking of Tits I did not see any alive, but in
the Gape Town Museum there is a very good case showing two nests
which are amongst the most intriguing imaginable. On a branch,
built of what can best be described as " blanket 55 consisting of fluff
and spiders' webs woven together, the nest, round about the size of
a small melon, with a long tunnel of the same material leading in and
out, would be impossible to investigate without destroying it. This
masterpiece is the work of the Penduline Tit. There are some very
good cases of birds in the museum which greatly assisted in identifica-
tion of the various species encountered.
One very pleasant afternoon was spent in the company of Dr.
Leonard Gill, the well-known authority on South African Birds.
I had hoped that he would be able to show me some specimens of birds
that I had not already seen and in particular the Orange-breasted
Sunbird. Dr. Gill knew just where, under favourable circumstances,
certain birds could be seen. Unfortunately every place was so com-
pletely dried up, being far on in the summer (January), that the birds
were not showing. In spite of that the outing was very enjoyable as
there was such a feeling of real professional power in the air. The fact is
that during the very dry season the birds migrate to the north from
the Gape where the rains produce both water and vegetation with the
accompanying flowers and insects. In passing let me say that I have
never been in a country where so few noxious insects abound, including
flies of every description. This probably only applies to the dry
season. This was one of the agreeable surprises of the tour.
The Bokmakierie Shrike is a nice bird besides being pretty and has
a lovely call note which reminds one of a Bullfinch and has a loud song
as well. It is also quite friendly and seems to frequent the low bush
around the coast. In the same quarters were what used to be known
to the trade as " African Singing Finches " in three sizes. Most of those
I saw were considerably larger than the kind one used to see in bird
shops. There are two or three different birds called Canaries which
frequent the coastal bush. They are dark green and not very interesting.
The very day after the futile expedition to look for the Orange-
breasted Sunbird I happened to see a beauty down at Gape Point in
the Game Reserve and Bird Sanctuary there. It was a thrill to see it
feeding on a Protea flower and later I saw another, far inland at
a place called Geres, feeding on the flowers of a white gum tree very
high up in the air. This flower is one of their favourites, and I am sure
there would have been more birds had it not been for the high wind
that was blowing at the time, swaying the trees to such an extent that
they really could not feed in comfort.
Kingfishers were remarkably scarce. The only species seen were the
Angola and the Pied. Of the latter I watched two or three diving after
fish in a lagoon near the coast. I spent several weeks around the coast

of the Gape Peninsula and visited two or three fairly prolific " vleis 55
or freshwater lagoons where there were Flamingoes, Pelicans, Black-
winged Stilts and Avocets, quantities of Coots, Waterhens, and, in one
case, Crested Grebes. One day, on arrival at the " vlei ", a small
sandbank out from the shore was covered with Terns and five Pelicans
were swimming around it. Later five more Pelicans arrived and settled
on the island. More and more Pelicans appeared in the sky all settling
on the island till there were fifty there and the Terns had all to take
off. The Pelicans looked rather like squadrons of aeroplanes in the
sky. I presumed that they had been fishing out to sea and had returned
inland to digest their catch. Round the sea coast there were innumer-
able pairs of White-breasted Sand Plover ; rather smaller than our
own Ringed Plover, they behave in just the same way. At the time of
my visit, a violent wind known as " The South Easter " was blowing
with the result that some of their eggs were blown along the sand and,
I think, several pairs lost their nests by sand blowing over them. In
more than one place I saw minute and newly hatched chicks about
the size of a walnut. Also on the shore were grown up families of
Oyster-catchers. These are jet black all over with orange red beaks
and legs, rather larger and heavier than our home species and certainly
less wary though they have exactly the same cries. &amp;apos;
One day sitting on the sands in a very secluded bay I had the luck
to see about twenty-five Penguins swimming along in front of me. Every
now and then they rose to the surface in a body but mostly they swam
under water, the waves being so transparent that they were easily
visible through the field glasses. There is only one kind of Penguin
around the coast--the Jackass or the Black-footed--the most unin-
teresting, I think, of the family, but these looked very nice seen in their
native surroundings.
Although I have not mentioned them yet, the birds which really
afforded me the greatest thrill to spy besides the Sunbirds were the
Blue-breasted and Pink-cheeked Waxbills and White-Eyes. A small
flock of White-Eyes frequented the trees of an hotel garden where I was
staying on the coast quite close to Cape Town, and the Waxbills I saw
amongst the trees in a beautiful shady ravine beside the Montagu
Hot Springs. I did not see as many of these as I would have liked owing
to the fact that I was travelling too fast and had not sufficient time to
devote to bird watching in earnest--in suitable places.
In addition to the birds mentioned, I saw several different kinds of
Swallows. They sat in large numbers on the telephone wires. Swifts,
both large and small, were also numerous but impossible to identify
on the wing. Large flocks of Guinea-fowl frequented the open bush
and the Game Reserves. Egrets, both large and small (Cattle Egrets or
Tick birds being very common), and Herons of various kinds were to
be seen around all the lagoons.

By The Rev. J. R. Lowe, M.A.
It was in the first week in April that we found him, sitting disconso-
late and forlorn at the foot of a large beech tree in the garden, and a
cut-leaved beech at that. His parents early in March had made no
secret of their intention to increase their kind. Father on windy days
in January in high brief lovely sentences had that in mind, and now
such hopes had been abundantly fulfilled and parental duties gladly
undertaken with no thought of family allowances. But there was a
problem at the foot of the tree, insufficiently clad for a cold spring day,
ridiculous stilt-like legs that persisted in folding up like a deck chair,
apologies for wings, twenty feet of bare beech trunk to the nursery, no
ladder, and the memory of misguided though kind attempts to return
wandering children to other nurseries with hideous results, shrieking
parents, children floundering all ways at once and the result an empty
nest.
No, the problem must be solved another way, after all he was
a parishioner of a kind, and I his minister.
With no kind of protestation I gathered him up, he was too new and
innocent to know what fear was. His parents I knew were shopping in
a field not far away.
I hurried with the new baby into the Vicarage. He snuggled
happily down in a cardboard box lined with soft hay. I have reared
a heap of waifs in 40 years from Carrion Grows to Willow Wrens, but
never was there so accommodating a child as this small Missel Thrush.
For the first fortnight alternate meals every three hours of goat's milk
and bread and a drop or two of cod liver oil and large worms. He
hated to start feeding himself, and even to-day he loves to be fed. He

has never looked back, his staple diet this dry summer has been
brown bread soaked in goat's milk with cod liver oil always. Beetles,
centipedes, but not wood lice, are accepted as valuable prizes, tiny
bits of raw meat, liver, rabbit, chicken, and cooked white fish are
always eaten with relish, in fact the child is omniverous.
A charming child, completely fearless, it would be disastrous if he
left his little garden aviary. My Siamese cat spends hours staring at
him and hoping, while he hardly bothers to chatter at her.
What lovely black eyes my waif possesses. The body moult is
complete but for head and neck, great black spots on a buff, deeper
than anything I have seen in a Missel Thrush before, perhaps it's the
cod liver oil.
Occasionally I am offered a straw, or a piece of hay ; does this
mean that after all I have an adopted daughter. I have an idea that
this is so.
Alongside the Missel, a young cock Blackbird, taken from a cat
later in June, and entirely unable to support himself, is beginning to
put on his sable coat. He is almost as tame as the Missel, but he and
his kind are a little hysterical and easily lose their heads.
I have dreams of match-making in the spring, though I don't like
hybrids.

Recent reports from members indicate that the past breeding season
has been above the average.
P. A. Birch reports that : " White Zebra Finches, Rock Pebblers,
G.M. Rosellas, Redrumps, and Yellow Redrumps have all done well.
On the debit side a proved breeding hen King died from a burst blood-
vessel after laying a rather large egg, and a hen Redrump hatched
nine eggs but let them all die at about a week old."
Captain R. W. Veitch has had success with two pairs of Alexandrine
Parrakeets and writes : " One pair five years old have reared young
for the first time, and one pair nearly twenty years old who have
reared young regularly for many years, but missed last year and the
previous year. Both pairs have two good young ones out in the flight
and feeding themselves."
Keston has had quite a good season, especially with Ringnecks.

E. J. Boosey will doubtlessly send his annual report in due course, so
I will not anticipate.
Miss M. C. Maitland has bred eight Cockatiels and three Stanleys.
E. N. T. Vane has done well, and amongst the birds reared are four
Noble's Macaws, three Leadbeater's Cockatoos, three Turquoisine
X Elegant, and a Green-winged King X King Parrakeet.

William Alden, head keeper of the Parrot House at the London Zoo,
is retiring at the end of the year after forty-three years' service. He has
marked his last season by several breeding successes, obtained under
far from ideal conditions ; two Queen Alexandra's, one Green-winged
King, and two hybrid Pennant's X Rosella Parrakeets. The many
members of the Society who have experienced innumerable kindnesses
from him over a very long period will unite in wishing " Bill " Alden
and his wife the very best of luck in his retirement.
California. --David West writes : " I have had seven young from a
rather odd Bourke mating. A year old cock mated with two hens and
both laid and produced young ones. Their first nests contained three
and two, while the second nests contained only one each.
" I have recently added five Adelaide Rosellas, probably the only
pure-bred stock in the U.S., and two pairs of Mexican Lineolated
Parrakeets."
Australia. --Leonard Webber reports : "You may be interested to
hear of a new mutation in the Gouldian Finch. So far this year I have
bred six 4 Green-headed ' Gouldians. The birds are not yet through the
complete moult, but there is a variation, from plain mid-green to
green on black, green and yellow, and a copper metallic hue with
green, yellow, red. These birds were from two sets of parents, details
of which I will release when the young birds have assumed full adult

Members of the Club, 32 ; guests, 21 ; total, 53.
The Chairman, opening the meeting, said he had great pleasure in
welcoming several important guests : Mr. Gansdale, Superintendent,
and Mr. Lester, Curator of Reptiles, London Zoo ; and Mr. and Mrs.
Rudkin, Jr., from California. Mr. F. H. Rudkin, Sr., had been a
member of the Society for nearly fifty years, and although long resident
in California was English by birth. He had formed probably the
largest collection of parrakeets in America and this was now shared
with his son. He welcomed this opportunity of sending greetings to
the father by the son.
Another C# guest "--a unique " guest 55 --was " Mr. Ramshaw ",
accompanied by his assistant, Captain C. W. R. Knight. He was
specially interested to see &amp;lt;c Mr. Ramshaw " had developed into such
a magnificent bird as, some twenty years ago, while Curator at the
Zoo, he had been instrumental in obtaining " Mr. Ramshaw " for
Captain Knight.
Captain Knight then gave a brief account of the world-travels and
exploits of " Mr. Ramshaw ", and the famous Golden Eagle was put
through his paces. Two or three short flights were made and a peck
or two at a chicken's head allowed as a reward for good behaviour.
Many questions were asked and answered in Captain Knight's
inimitable manner. Sustained applause by the audience indicated
the appreciation and enjoyment of this remarkable " partnership ".
Mr. Rudkin said that he and his wife were delighted to attend this
meeting of the Club. Many members were already well known, at
least by name, to him through hearing his father speak of them. They
were due to return to America on the following day, and his father
would derive great pleasure in hearing they had been entertained by
the Club. During his visit to England he had had opportunities of
seeing several collections, and of the birds he had seen those that most
appealed to him were lutino Ring-necked Parrakeets--a variety
virtually unknown in America. Mr. Rudkin modestly referred to some
of the many breeding successes obtained in the Rudkin aviaries, and
in this connection mentioned Leadbeater's Cockatoos, Eclectus
Parrots, Chattering Lories and, of course, blue Masked Lovebirds,
of which they had a couple of dozen breeding pairs.
The Chairman thanked Mr. Rudkin for his remarks and there was
the usual acclamation.
The date of the next meeting is 9th November, 1949.

incapacitated for several weeks with a strained Achilles tendon. He is,
fortunately, now able to get about again.
Third Vice-President Jean Delacour returned to New York on
15th August. His very many friends this side of the Atlantic find his
visits all too brief.
Gerald Durrell and Kenneth Smith returned from West Africa at the
end of August. Their seven months' trip has resulted in a collection of
some five hundred animals, reptiles, and birds, destined for various
zoos. Viewers had an opportunity of seeing them with some of their
captures--a Potto, two Mona Monkeys, and a Python--on television's
" Picture Page ", on 31st August.
The Perry River Expedition, financed by the Arctic Institute of
North America, was successful in its search for Ross's Snow Goose.
Three hundred pairs were found breeding on a small lake ; ten of
these Geese were amongst the birds shipped to England by Peter Scott.
Andrew Wilson has long cherished the ambition to open a Zoological
Park in the West of Scotland. This ambition has now been fulfilled by
the recent opening of the Graigend Castle Zoological Gardens. They
are within easy reach of Glasgow and consist of some 220 acres of park-
land, woods, and lochs. We shall watch their development with great
interest.

Cyril Newberry. Country Life, Limited. 12 s. 6 d. net.
The days of collecting the skins and eggs of birds have, happily,
gone, at least to a great extent, and they have been followed by the
fascinating and harmless pastime of bird-watching which becomes
more popular every year. But to watch and make notes of wild birds
is less satisfying to some enthusiasts than in being able to record
observations by means of photographs, and so the art of bird photo-
graphy both in colour and monochrome in still pictures and cine-
matograph films is becoming very popular.
We should all like to be able to take good pictures of wild birds
but, although many have tried, only a few have completely succeeded.
Among these few the name of Eric Hosking appears as a master in
the art, having produced probably more first class photographs than
anyone.
It is not every successful artist who is willing to give away the
secrets of his success and so all who would wish to become good

bird photographers will be very grateful to Eric Hosking and his
collaborator, Cyril Newberry, for giving us a book containing not
only many superb examples of bird photography, but very full informa-
tion as to how these were obtained. We are told of the right sort of
equipment and given full instructions as to how to use it, and of how
to approach the birds and to find their nests without unduly disturbing
them. In this we have to be very careful as a hasty and inconsiderate
would-be photographer may do much harm and be just as much a
menace to the birds as is the egg collector. One wonders how many
nests have come to grief by the careless and thoughtless person who,
thinking only of the picture he is after, cuts away or tramples down the
vegetation and so exposes the nest to predators, or by undue haste
scares the birds away for good and all. This is not likely to happen
if the aspirant to this art follows carefully the advice given in this
excellent book. D. S-S.

BIRDS OF BRITAIN. By J. D. Macdonald (in charge of Birds,
British Museum). G. Bell and Sons, Ltd. 8 s. 6 d. net.
This is a small volume designed to provide an easy way of naming
some 200 of the commoner British birds. It is divided into two sections,
the first being a guide to the various groups so that the beginner may
recognize in which group to place any given bird. Then having
decided whether it is, for instance, a Grow, Thrush, Warbler, or what
not, he turns to the second section where he finds descriptions of
the birds in each group and so should not find much difficulty in
spotting his bird. The book only professes to include such birds as
might be met with by the novice, and so most of the rarities are
omitted. One is surprised to find the Aquatic Warbler included and
others that anybody might come across with luck, omitted. For
instance, during the severe winter of 1946-7, Waxwings were seen by
many people, even in town gardens, and in parts of the country several
of the less common migrants are seen every year on migration.
Juvenile plumages are omitted as, we are told, young birds can be
identified by association with their parents. But they keep their
juvenile dress long after they have left their parents. The young Robin,
for instance, that frequents one's garden in its spotted plumage, or the
young Starling in its brown livery.
There are several quite useful coloured and uncoloured plates, each
one figuring eight or more species, and on the whole both the drawing
and colouring are good. Pen drawings are freely distributed through-
out the text and these, in most cases at least, are a distinct help to

identification. A few, however, such as the Nightingale, Meadow
Pipit, and Hedge Sparrow, are not a success. All the illustrations are
by Phyllida Lumsden, who has added greatly to the value of the book,

may not be of much use to most people, but some of us have very often

Visit to Cleres in May, 1950
At the kind invitation of Monsieur Jean Delacour arrangements are being made
for members of the Avicultural Society to visit Cleres in 1950. The party will leave
London on the morning of Saturday, 20th May, crossing via Newhaven-Dieppe, and
arriving in Cleres that afternoon ; and will return on Monday, 22nd May. Hotel
accommodation will be arranged in Cleres and members will be informed of the
inclusive cost of the trip. The number of the party will be limited, so those wishing to
visit Cleres should apply to the Hon. Secretary in good time.
Monsieur Delacour is also inviting Belgian and French aviculturists to visit Cleres
at the same time, and it is hoped this occasion will result in closer co-operation between
the aviculturists of the three countries.

June, 1949. --The registered additions were sixty-four in number.
Nine Gentoo Penguins {Pygoscelispapua) arrived from South Georgia, via Montevideo
by air : presented by the Governor of the Falkland Islands, they are the first of their
species to be exhibited in the Collection since 1929. John Bowden presented two Gold
Coast birds, a Blue Touracou ( Corythceola cristata ) and an African Crake ( Crecopsis
egregia ), the latter new to the Collection.
A Savigny's Eagle-Owl {Bubo ascalaphus ) from the Sudan was presented by J. G.
Mavrogordato ; and 10 Shaga {Phalocrocorax aristotelis) , from the Isle of Lambey,
were received in exchange.

GIANT WHYDAHS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983365388888889" page_id="56311930"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
We have here at Keston two cock Giant Whydahs which have just come into full
colour in two planted aviaries.
When we obtained them out of colour last winter, I noticed that one of them
was perceptibly the smaller bird of the two, and wondered if they were a pair. Now
that they have come into colour, however, the larger one turns out to be the well-
known bird with the handsome cream and orange shoulder patches, whereas the
other, in addition to its smaller size, entirely lacks the coloured shoulder patches.
The only indication I can find that there are two forms of Giant Whydah is in
Aviculture, vol. i, where it is stated that " The Kenyan form (C. delamerei) with still
longer tail has recently been imported into England ", but no mention is made of
any difference in plumage.
Perhaps one of our South African members can tell me if the smaller black-
shouldered bird we have is C. delamerei from Kenya ?
If so, very few can ever have been imported, because although, since I was quite
a small boy, I have seldom been without Giant Whydahs in my aviaries, I cannot
recall having ever seen one before without the coloured shoulder patches.

<bodyText confidence="0.970286714285714" page_id="56311930"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
As one who has kept ornamental Pheasants for a large number of years, I have no
hesitation in saying that I consider the Registry of ornamental Pheasants is a fine
job of work. I feel sure that many fanciers, in addition to myself, are indeed grateful
to Mr. George Weaver for all the work he has put in making the census of these
birds. Whether our hobby is Pheasants, Waterfowl, Parrots, or any other kind of
bird, it is essential that information should be available as to the numbers and sexes
of the birds which are in captivity. We are experiencing difficulty at the present time
in getting the birds we require, but with a Registry it greatly helps fanciers in obtaining
the birds they need, and in many cases prevents the extinction of rare species.
I feel that the Avicultural Society is to be congratulated on this work, and I hope
that members will back it up all they can.

BIRD PLUMAGE ON HATS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99549575" page_id="56311930"  page_num="196" year="" vol="">
A few days ago I had occasion to follow a popular custom of the times by standing
in a queue, and during the period of waiting my attention was drawn to the hat of
a lady in front of me. Although not an expert in feminine headgear, the hat in
question was to my mind certainly modern, and the outstanding feature was the
skins (including heads) of five Hummingbirds, together with a number of wings from
a larger species which I could not identify. Whilst moulted feathers of certain colourful
species including Pheasants and Peafowl are always in great demand for ornamental
purposes it came as an unpleasant surprise to see complete bird skins in use after so
many years. One wonders if the traffic in these has recommenced, or if this is an
instance of putting to a more practicable use the relics of Grannie's Victorian glass
case ! I sincerely trust that the latter is the answer, far too many rare species having
come to near extermination at the hands of plumage hunters.

</sectionHeader>

(Chrysolophus amherstia)
By David Seth-Smith, M.B.O.U.
With the scarcity of all Ornamental Pheasants as well as other birds
desired by aviculturists, the Amherst Pheasant is once more regarded,
as it always should be, as one of, if not the most beautiful as well as
desirable of the whole group to which it belongs. That is if one wishes
for a thing of beauty rather than an object of sport, for as such it has
never been a success. It has been introduced into coverts where
Pheasants were preserved for sport and has proved hardy and prolific
but tended to drive out other Pheasants which were far more useful.
It is not in any sense a utility Pheasant but as an aviary bird it has
few equals, being as hardy as any, a free breeder, and extremely
beautiful.
The native home of the Amherst Pheasant is Western China and
Tibet, and it was first described, by Leadbeater, in 1828 from two
living examples presented by the King of Ava to Sir Archibald
Campbell and by him to Lady Amherst, who kept them for a time in
India before bringing them to England. Both were cocks and did not
survive for very long, and it was not until some forty years later that
half a dozen specimens, of which only one was a hen, reached the
Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park. Others came later, and the bird
became popular. It was at once evident that it was a close relation
of the Golden Pheasant, a species that had been well known in this
country for many years. It proved to be as easily bred in captivity as
that species and the two, being very closely allied, were found to cross
freely. Some of the hybrids are certainly of startling appearance and
were at first regarded as things of great beauty, but, to my mind, are
less beautiful than either of the parent species. No doubt some of these
crosses were produced as a result of the scarcity of Amherst hens, but
many from a mistaken notion that Nature could be improved upon.
Crossing has done wonders in horticulture, but in the zoological world
it is rarely a success and in the case of these two Pheasants it has
proved disastrous and really pure-bred Amherst Pheasants are now
much scarcer than the hybrids. Any Pheasant keeper who has them

should regard them as great treasures and be careful to keep them pure.
It is not difficult to distinguish a pure cock Amherst from one with
traces of the Golden, but not so easy to be sure of the purity of the hen,
for the hens of the two are much alike though readily distinguishable
by the expert. Hybrid cocks always show traces of red either on the
flanks or abdomen.
Perhaps the most characteristic feature of the cocks of the two
species of Chrysolophus is the tippet, or ruff which, in the Amherst, is
white, each feather being margined with a band of dark green. The
breast and back are metallic green, each feather tipped with black.
The under parts are white, the rump yellow, a certain amount of red
on the tail-coverts, while the broad tail itself is white banded with
black, the two central feathers being of a lace-like texture. The
forehead is green and the crest crimson, the skin of the face blue and
the legs and feet lead-coloured. The Amherst hen is somewhat larger
than that of the Golden and the dark bars on her plumage are broader.
As already mentioned, the Amherst is a free breeder and, unlike
many species of Pheasant, the hens will readily incubate their eggs
provided their aviary is spacious and furnished with ample cover.
In fact, without these conditions the cock is only too likely to kill the
hen, especially if there is only one. There should be four or five hens
to one cock in a breeding pen as the polygamous cock is far too
vigorous to be content with only one mate.
The display of the cock Amherst to his mate is very similar to that
of the Golden and is a beautiful and interesting performance. With
mincing steps he runs around her, suddenly stopping and spreading
his whole body sideways so as to present the most striking of his
colours. The broad tail is spread, the body flattened so as to show the
upper side, and the tippet opened out like a fan on the side nearest to
the object of his attention, forming an almost complete circle with the
eye in the centre. Suddenly he rushes around in the opposite direction
and, approaching his mate, again spreads his plumage on the side
nearest to her. This performance goes on for quite a long time each
day during the height of the breeding season and, as one watches this
wonderful bird showing off his exquisite plumage, one realizes why it
has been called the " Flower Pheasant ", a title perhaps equally
applicable to the only other member of the genus.
Although both of these Pheasants will, under favourable conditions,
incubate their own eggs and rear their young, the usual practice with
Pheasant keepers is to remove the eggs and give them in charge of light
hens of which, perhaps, the most reliable type is a cross between the
silkie and some clean-legged breed of bantam. At the Zoo we used
to employ a silkie-jungle-fowl cross. The method is more certain
than leaving the eggs to the Pheasant though hardly such true
aviculture.

By George A. J. Weaver, F.Z.S.
It will be remembered that about two years ago the first census of
Ornamental Pheasants, Peafowl, and Junglefowl was undertaken to
ascertain the approximate numbers and species still maintained in
these Islands, and it is due to the resulting information that many odd
birds have changed ownership. It was hoped that with the pairing up
of these odd birds a substantial increase in numbers would be seen the
following year, but unfortunately the wet summer produced low
fertility and a further count was not deemed worthwhile. So far 1949
has proved more encouraging, and probably the best news received to
date comes from Leckford where a nice batch of Swinhoe chicks have
been reared. This success should greatly help in re-establishing one of
the rarer species (certainly as far as this country is concerned), the
1947 count showing but 23 individuals surviving in the British Isles.
It has been decided to again take a count, and at the same time compile
detailed information on feeding under post-war conditions, possible
reasons for low fertility, and general impressions on the state of pens
and enclosures. Fanciers, be their stock one or one hundred, are once
more asked to give their support to this scheme by returning Registry
Forms as soon as possible, at the same time stating " wants " or birds
for disposal.
Perhaps a few notes on the activities of Pheasant lovers across the
Atlantic may be of interest to fanciers here. It is pleasing to hear that
these birds are flourishing in America, species such as the Silver,
Golden, and Amherst being far too numerous to arrive at an approxi-
mate figure. Others which we in England now term as rare, including
Elliot's, Swinhoe's, Blue and Brown Grossoptilans, Firebacks, Trago-
pans, and Peacock Pheasants are kept and breed in fair numbers, as
may be gathered by the following specimen advertisement taken from
a current number of Modern Gamebreeding , and which is but one of
dozens that may be found in the pages of this periodical.

Surely an item to make any Pheasant lover in England feel envious
and long for better days.
One of the foremost establishments breeding Pheasants in the U.S.A.
is the Circle H Ranch, where a large and varied collection is main-
tained by the owner Mr. Claude Hooke. Probably the only remaining
pairs of White Crossoptilans are to be found here although there are
a number of odd birds of this species to be found in other collections.
Another rare species represented by at least a pair is the Malayan Argus
whilst most others that we in England regard as scarce are kept by
Mr. Hooke.
A past Secretary of the American O.P.S., Mr. A. F. Sturgis, includes
the following birds in his collection at Philadelphia. Cheer, Elliot's,
Blue, Brown, and White Crossoptilans, Imperials, Impeyans, Mikado,
and Temminck's and Satyr Tragopans.
Mr. Lawrence Taylor, the present Yearbook editor to the above
Society, has a representative collection and the latest news to hand is
that Elliot's were hatching well and Impeyans were laying. The Bel's
unfortunately died in the shell. Some interesting information has been
given me by this gentleman concerning the feeding of ground-up
alfalfa hay to Pheasants. This hay, which is a type of clover, contains
a high protein content, and is used throughout the country by sheep
and dairy farms, also in the large Turkey and game Pheasant estab-
lishments. With present day difficulties in procuring feed for livestock,
any alternative that proves beneficial deserves consideration. Have
any members here tried this ? If so may we hear the results ? Mr.
Taylor has until recently numbered White Crossoptilans among his
many birds and was successful in breeding from them for several
seasons, the chicks, however, dying suddenly when about two weeks
old. An expert from a proprietary Game Bird Food concern was
consulted and gave his opinion that these losses were due to gizzard
erosion.
Mr. D. W. Rich of the Golden West Pheasantry of San Gabriel also
deserves mention, species of special interest at this establishment being
Malayan Crested Firebacks and Grey Junglefowl.
Mr. Rudkin of Fillmore, California, has an interesting collection
including Swinhoe's, Elliot's, and Germains Peacock Pheasants. Ten
young were reared from the latter in 1947 and perhaps of note is the
number of Specifer Peafowl reared that season, 12 from a male and
two females. Incidentally the Specifer Peafowl is fairly well established
in America and this may be due to the fact that the majority are kept
in better climatic conditions than we in England can expect. This
gentleman also has a number of the other varieties of Peafowl, his
Whites bringing up fifteen young and the Common a similar number.
A few records from Canadian fanciers have also come to hand and again
we find Swinhoe's, Elliot's and Impeyans in fair numbers. Mr. G. R.

Marshall of Hamilton keeps these, together with the commoner species
all more or less breeding fairly well.
I have been able to contact a number of Zoological Institutions in
America regarding their Pheasant collections and the following is a
brief account of the more outstanding species.
The Philadelphia Zoo has approximately 18 species, Siamese Crested
Firebacks, Blue and Brown Crossoptilans, Cheer, and Satyr Tragopans
being of particular note.
New York Zoo can show 33 species some of which must be almost
the only representatives in captivity. The " plums " of this collection
are Malayan, Bornean, and Siamese Crested Firebacks, two Rheinarts
Argus, one Great Argus, and two Imperial. Others include White
Crested, Black Crested, and Lineated Kalij, Germains Peacock
Pheasant, Cheer, White Crossoptilan, and Elliot's. The General
Curator, Mr. Lee S. Crandall has kindly compiled a list of species kept
in the U.S.A. together with his estimated strength of each species which
may give a further indication as to the position there.

the O.P.S., more or less confirms this list although he excludes Copper
and includes Palawan Peacock Pheasants and Bornean Argus. It
would appear that Blyth's and Cabot's Tragopans, the Crestless
Firebacks, and Bronze Tailed Peacock Pheasants have completely
disappeared and some of the rarer species are more or less confined to
zoos where there are no facilities for breeding. However, as can be seen,
the position is most encouraging as far as the majority of species are
concerned and we trust that when restrictions lift our American
friends will be in the position to send us the fresh blood we so badly
need.
To revert to our own problems, materials for building pens appear
a little easier to come by and it may be a good idea, whilst waiting
for stock to become available, to proceed with the construction of any
pens contemplated and plant same with suitable cover. Thus growth
may become well established which will be found a great advantage
when turning out fresh acquisitions, for it will not only be an en-
couragement to breed but will obviate to some extent the damage to

grass and small shrubs that usually results on releasing birds in
newly planted enclosures.
Pheasant enthusiasts may be interested to hear that M. Delacour
has completed in manuscript form his work Pheasants of the World and
that it should be published towards the end of the year or early in
1950, matters being delayed somewhat by the time required in execu-
ting the plates. This valuable book will contain 20 maps, 16 coloured
and 16 black and white plates by J. G. Harrison and as the majority
of these illustrations will show five birds, most species and sub-species
will be pictured. Imperial, Salvador's, Crested Argus, and Congo
Peacock, which are not found in Beebe's monograph, will each have
a plate to itself, a welcome addition to the existing works of reference.
In giving this information to the American O.P.S. on 5th January,
M. Delacour at the same time remarked on the lack of accurate data
regarding the successive plumages and life habits of many species
commonly kept in captivity and urged breeders to make notes of their
birds behaviour, etc., for future reference. British ornithologists and
aviculturists have always been to the fore in their detailed accounts
and keen observation of birds, and we should not let this be an excep-
tion. If members will send such information to me, I will gladly
compile a record of same and publish in this Magazine at a later date.
Data is required under the following headings :--
Behaviour. Display. Mating. Voice. Feeding Habits. Shape
and Colour of Eggs (Size in cmm. if possible). Incubation Periods.
Colour and Markings of Downy Chicks, First Year Plumage,
Moults, etc.
Will everyone owning Pheasants, irrespective of species kept, please
assist in this additional inquiry and further the cause of science ?

By Jos. R. Lowes
I am writing this article on the method adopted by me for the
rearing of my Pheasants and Waterfowl, hoping to be able to pass on
some information which will enable some of my fellow members to
save many chicks and ducklings which otherwise would be lost through
feeding and attempting to rear on food which is unsuitable to them
and against nature itself. Do let us follow nature as much as possible
and think for a while what the birds are reared on in their wild state
whether in the jungle or otherwise and until such times as they are old
enough to judge for themselves regarding their likes and dislikes. It is
during those critical first two weeks of their existence on which I want
to dwell and let us ask ourselves " what do they feed on in their
natural habitat ". The answer is insects ! Their first feed is insects
caught by their mother and offered to the chicks and ducklings from
time to time until they begin to look for them on their own accord ;
and so they carry on living on insects until they become older and
require a change of diet suitable to them and perhaps more easily
obtained but it is those first two weeks which are the making or breaking
of a Pheasant's or Duck's life. Many are lost in the early stages of their
life due to that lack of thought and by trying to force them to eat food
which is unsuitable and does not agree with their delicate digestive
system. I like to study my young stock and find through experience
that the method I use, and shall continue to use, and also pass on to
others, is within the reach of every fancier to-day whether he or she
has only a pen of Goldens or twenty pens of a varied collection. This
season I have again been successful with my rearing of ornamental
pheasants which include Goldens, Silvers, Reeves, Temmincks
Tragopans, Blue Grossoptilan, Edwards, Swinhoe, and Jungle Fowl,
also this season I have introduced ornamental waterfowl and am the
proud possessor of 22 Carolina and Mandarin Ducklings.
I can hear some of my fellow members saying " yes, but what about
your losses " ; well, my losses have been 2 Pheasants and 2 Ducks and
these deaths were due to the broodie crushing them when first put out
in the coops, since then my losses have been nil. As many of you know,
through past experience, that one does get a clumsy broodie once in
a while and you cannot avoid accidents. I lost many of my Pheasants
during the war through bombing but now I am making up for lost time
with the aid of Mother Nature who is the provider of my requirements
so essential to our young stock. By this I mean Fresh Ant Eggs,
no secret, only common sense, and by this method of feeding I have
not only saved many of my chicks but I know I am giving them

something which they need so much and at the same time know that
it will not upset their little stomachs. In addition green food is provided
at all times as some Pheasant chicks eat more than others.
After the chicks are hatched out, dried, and well on their feet,
I transfer them into the meadow in a coop with run attached, give
them nothing for at least 36 hours when by that time they are beginning
to look round for something to eat.
That something is a tin containing ants eggs which I have
previously collected in readiness, and by dropping a few beside the
broodie, who will in most cases pick one up and call the chicks to her
and at the same time almost saying " look what I have got for you "
she will then drop it, when it will be at once picked up by the strongest
chick first, then as the others strengthen there is a rush for who has to
be first to secure the tit-bit. They will only take a few the first feed or
so but these they increase as they go along until I give them 5 feeds per
day ; the first as early as possible and the last as late as possible, with
clean fresh water available at all times. By the end of the first week
when the runs are taken away (in some cases earlier), it is noticeable
how they will run towards you knowing that you are bringing them
something which they enjoy and relish at all times no matter how the
day or what the time.
Well, we have got the first week over and all is well, with the chicks
growing and feathering to satisfaction, but now we must think of
introducing other food and reducing the ants eggs. I use a good
quality biscuit meal which can be obtained in 3 sizes, small, medium,
and large and into this is added a small quantity of G.L.O. which is
first class in helping the chicks through with their crown feathers ;
moisten the biscuit meal with boiling water, allow it to cool before
feeding, then add a little meat, meal, and ants eggs ; these they will
pick out first, but eventually begin to take the biscuit meal, etc., but
each day now I reduce the quantity of ants eggs until by the end
of the second week they are completely on another diet. If you have
an unlimited supply of ants eggs near by, then my advice is " carry on "
with them as long as the supply lasts, there is nothing better, and by
this method, whether you are rearing on a free range or confined to
pens and aviaries your losses will be very small indeed and many of
the rarer species of Pheasants will be saved, not only that, it is cheap and
it is the ideal feed for rearing Pheasant chicks. This method applies
also to the rearing of ornamental ducks with only enough water to
drink, having almost filled their drinking tin with small stones which
only allows them to get a little water between the stones, until after
the first week ; if then they are growing well and strong I place a 6 inch
kitchen sink in their run, drop it to the level of the ground and fill it
with water ; here they need only be watched a little while to know that
they are happy and content and if a few ants eggs are thrown into the

water they soon make short work of them. How many will say 44 where
are we to get the ants eggs ? Well, there are many counties in England
where there is an abundance of these, especially in heavily wooded
districts and it only requires a little time and labour ; but at the same
time you know that what chicks you lost last year will this time be
saved. Also a few inquiries made in your district will provide you with
the required information. Failing this, an advertisement in the local
paper will most likely do the trick. I feel I must warn you here, that it
is not all plain sailing gathering ants eggs and perhaps if my advice is
followed it might save a little discomfort at times. First of all, having
learnt where there are some ant hills be sure to buy a pair of rubber
gloves, because on opening the ant hill, the ants at once put up a fine
spray of formic acid which coming in contact with your bare hands
will destroy the outer layer of skin which all peels off in the course of
a few days, so by using a pair of rubber gloves you will save this ; also
use a pair of trouser clips to fasten the trouser bottoms. Open up the
ant hill and there near the surface you will find an abundance of fresh
ant eggs which you place in a tin complete with lid. Here I must leave
the collecting of ants eggs because I am getting away from the theme
of my article but if any member cares to write to me I shall be only
too glad to give them a plan to follow ; but what I do wish to point out
in conclusion, do let us take advantage of this method of rearing our
rarer species of Pheasant and Duck rather than try to rear them on
something which upsets their digestion and I am writing from past
experience and hoping to be able to pass on what I have found a great
success. If it has to be that you have to buy a few ants eggs to start off
your Impeyans or Tragopans etc., surely it is more satisfactory to
spend 30 shillings for ants eggs and save your chicks than to spend
#3 on something unsuitable and lose them, but I do know from letters
received from time to time that this is happening. Here I must state
that I do not sell ants eggs ! This method of rearing does not only
apply to our ornamental Pheasants, but also to our Game Pheasant,
which owing to Government restrictions placed upon the buying of
foodstuffs have to be reared by nature's method, and in my capacity of
Head Keeper one can, and has done, during the past war, shot 470
wild Pheasants in one day simply because two of the most essential
things were kept foremost in our minds, i.e. keeping down the vermin
and allowing nature to provide the food in the way of insects ; later,
of course, when insect food begins to get short we have in our Pheasant
a great specialist in adaptation and throughout the season they can
turn their attention regarding food to whatever comes along in rota-
tion, but try always, if possible, to allow your chicks a free range ;
I know it is not always convenient to do so, if space is confined, then
make a practice of moving your coops and runs once a day onto fresh
ground, then after the rearing season is over, give your ground a good

dose of lime which will then sweeten the ground ready for another
season. Again, let me once more stress the importance of fresh insect
food especially in the early stages, you will also find that you will also
be free from stomach and bowel complaints, particularly indigestion,
and many of our ornamental Pheasant chicks die of this through giving
them food which soon goes sour especially in hot weather.
Since starting to write this article my Ghukar Partridges have
hatched out, nine of them, and now they are a week old and being
fed as stated and doing well. If you notice your chicks are nice and
tight in the feather then you know all is well, but once they begin to
fluff out and drop their wings a little then look out for trouble, they
refuse whatever you are feeding with and take no interest in life
whatever and perhaps by morning they are dead, due to indigestion.

such a sick and complicated diet. Remember you can kill your chicks

REMINISCENCES OF A PHEASANT FANCIER
By G. Beever
Having previously written several articles on pheasants for the
Avicultural Magazine, I find it difficult to write anything really

new. However when I look back on my experiences, I come to the
conclusion that it was an extremely lucky day for me when I became
a fancier of these wonderful birds.
From the first day that I owned a pair of Goldens in 1919, I became
thoroughly infected with the pheasant " bug I spent all my spare
time building aviaries, writing to various people for information on
the subject, visiting libraries, zoos, and museums, in search of anything
that would improve my knowledge of the birds.
If I saw advertisements of any new arrivals in London or Liverpool,
I often took the first chance to go and see them, although at that time
I could not afford to buy any but the cheaper kinds. People thought
I was completely mad to travel two hundred miles to see a few
pheasants. Eventually I became a member of the Avicultural Society

and this in turn enabled me to make the acquaintance of other members
interested in the birds. Many of these are still my friends. I also
made acquaintances in France and the United States which resulted
in my visiting these countries.
One of the bright lights of my pheasant experiences was when
I took a party of thirty to Cleres in 1937 to see Mr. Delacour's wonder-
ful collection of pheasants and other birds. It was a most perfect day
and everyone was charmed with the chateau and grounds, apart from
the birds. During the walk round the park one gentleman said to me,
" Well, this is the nearest thing to Paradise that I have ever seen. 55
The collection at that time was at its best.
Besides the pheasants which included some rare species like the
Mikado, Palawan Peacock Pheasant, and White Crossoptilon, we saw
numerous parrots at liberty and a large collection of ducks, cranes, and
other waterfowl. Perhaps the most interesting bird was a Crowned
Crane that accompanied us all the afternoon, and when we posed for
our photographs at the end of the tour, the Crane stood right in the
middle of the congregation.
Being a Pheasant fancier was also the cause of my visiting the U.S.A.
on three occasions. About 1926 I began to correspond with the late
Mr. Denley of Washington D.C. Every time he wrote to me he asked
me to pay a visit to U.S.A. to stay with him ; at last I decided to go, as
I could not possibly say no any longer.
I went in 1929, 1931, and 1939. He had a wonderful collection and
bought every species of pheasant procurable. I saw there the only
pair of Koklass I have ever seen. Whilst in U.S.A. I have on different
occasions visited New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Detroit
zoos also the Kellog Sanctuary at Battle Creek.
When I started with pheasants, literature on the subject was very
scarce, but the publication of Beebe's Monograph fulfilled a long felt
want, and the splendid coloured plates enable present-day fanciers
to form an opinion of the beauty of the different species. In some old
books the plates and drawings of Goldens and other Pheasants are
simply atrocious and often incorrect.
It is a pity that the Ornamental Pheasant Society has ceased to
function, as the magazine published by the society contained valuable
information that had never been in print previously. I have always
been immensely interested in the discovery of new species and in the
importation of species previously recorded but not imported.
During my thirty years as a fancier, several beautiful species have
been imported that in my wildest dreams I never expected seeing.
Amongst these I can think of Bulwers White Tailed Pheasant, Palawan

208 LEE S. CRANDALL-THE CONGO PEACOCK IN CAPTIVITY
doubt when Mr. Delacour writes his new book, we shall hear about
the latest new and sub-species of Pheasants.
I am also very impatient for information about the Congo Peacock
and wonder whether I shall live long enough to see a live one in
captivity.
My object in writing this short article is to show that a hobby like
pheasant-owning adds to the variety of life and brings friends, acquain-
tances, and experiences that add enormously to the pleasures of living.

THE CONGO PEACOCK IN CAPTIVITY
By Lee S. Crandall
(General Curator, New York Zoological Park)
When Charles Cordier, the well-known collector, went to the
Belgian Congo in the interests of the New York Zoological Society,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.985629344827586" page_id="56311950"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
his principal objective was the Congo Peacock (.Afropavo congensis).
That was in October, 1947, and it was not until 15th June, 1949, that
the shipment finally arrived, by air, in New York. A broken leg,
coupled with the innumerable other vicissitudes that beset the collector
in Africa, delayed the return but did not prevent final success. For
besides many other zoological treasures, Cordier proudly displayed
seven Congo Peacocks, the first living specimens to be seen outside
Africa.
It is still too early to forecast what the future of these birds may be.
There were five adult cocks, a chick of 1949, already showing cock
plumage and a single hen. During the remainder of the summer,
the birds were kept in small planted outdoor aviaries. What seemed
to be the best cock was run with the hen, three of the remaining cocks
were kept together, and the fourth, suspected of truculence, remained
alone. The cocks were noticeably apathetic, and definitely on the
dull side. The hen was much more alert and tighter in plumage. All
were quite tame and not easily frightened.
In mid-October, the birds were taken indoors for the winter, all
of the cocks in one pen, the pair in another. Once in dry, warm
quarters, all immediately responded with tighter plumage and im-
provement in general appearance. If they winter well, we shall have
confirmed or disproved our feeling that cocks are not inclined to
quarrel. And another spring will bring opportunity to test the
possibilities of breeding in captivity.
Feeding has been chiefly on greens, fruits, vegetables, and pheasant
biscuit, with a little grain. Our brief experience indicates that the
Congo Peacock is not too difficult in captivity and that its require-
ments more or less parallel those of the Argus Pheasants, with the
added advantage that odd cocks at least seasonally, will live together.

THE MUTATION OBSGURUS IN THE LADY
AMHERST PHEASANT
By Professor A. Ghigi
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999060947368421" page_id="56311953"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
It is several years since I thought of introducing in the Lady Amherst
Pheasant the mutation which produces the dark plumage in the
Golden Pheasant, a mutation known as obscurus. To secure this I
mated a black-throated Golden Pheasant ( obscurus ) with a Lady
Amherst hen of very pure strain. It is known that the character
obscurus is recessive in conjunction with the normal Golden Pheasant ;
thus all the young resulting from this pair were identical with those
which are obtained if the two species, Golden and Lady Amherst are
crossed. But these hybrids produced, following the Mendel law, a
quarter of young which were completely obscurus.
When the two obscurus cocks which I reared attained their adult
plumage, I was surprised by the remarkable differences to their hybrid
parents and their grandparents of pure strain. I will not repeat the
detailed description which I have published in Acta Pontificia Academia
Scientiarum , and I will confine myself to saying that both of them had
a white crest, and that one had a dark grey belly separated from the
greenish-black neck by a band of light grey, while the other had all
the underparts entirely black.
These birds were adult in 1944, when the Germans occupied Bologna
and my house. It was necessary to place several Pheasants in unsuit-
able accommodation, and the two black cocks F.2 obscurus X amherstia
died, and were made into skins.
Of this lot I was left with a single obscurus hen, which I was not able
to mate with a pure Lady Amherst cock until this year (1949). She
has laid twenty-five eggs, of which half were incubated, producing
eight young of light colour as if they had been the result of an ordinary
cross amherstia X ( pictus X amherstia ).
Unfortunately a polecat killed five of these birds, and I have only
a cock and two hens left. From this lot I expect one dark mutant
against three normal hybrids having three-quarters Amherst and a
quarter Golden blood ; but the mutation obscurus can change the
entire system of coloration in an unforeseen manner.
It is curious that the melanistic mutation should be dominant in the
genus Phasianus , while it is recessive in the genus Chrysolophus. In
the first case it is susceptible of selection by at least two degrees, while
in Chrysolophus pictus it does not appear to have the differences of degree,
but in both cases the chicks have more or less extended white spots
which disappear when the full plumage is assumed.

I am writing this article with some diffidence because I have no
long experience of Pheasant rearing and in fact I have only entirely
by myself reared Golden and Silver Pheasants, and that was fifteen
or twenty years ago. It seems to me that generally speaking there
must be something fundamentally wrong with the way Pheasants are
usually reared and kept in captivity. Each year one hears about bad
fertility and it seems universal. This in itself is perhaps the most
striking feature of the unnaturalness of the captive stocks. Pheasants
(and as far as Britain and the colder countries are concerned I am not
including the tropical Pheasants in these generalizations) were by
nature intended to be very fecund birds. They laid large clutches of
eggs and hatched big broods ; vermin, weather, and parasites thinned
their numbers. Nature never intended Pheasants to lay say a dozen
eggs and hatch three or four.
I think infertility may be caused in part by the intensive rearing
systems now so generally adopted. Some species especially amongst
the earlier introductions have proved pretty permanent in captivity.
Of the commoner species such as Golden, Amherst, Silver, and Reeves,
the larger proportion of the young bred have been reared by people
who only rear a few broods of Pheasants and have the chicks running
loose in their gardens. Brown Grossoptilan are, I believe, all descended
from three birds imported into France in the 1860s. From these three
birds and their children of the first season somewhere about 200 young
were reared in the second breeding season. I wonder if Monsieur
Delacour can give any details from the available records of whether
these young were reared in the fields as the game Pheasants were in
Europe before the late war ? In striking contrast is the history of
another Grossoptilan, the White. Some birds were bred from the
original wild stock, but now I believe pure breeding stocks are prac-
tically non-existent. Why the difference ? The best brood of Blue
Grossoptilans that I ever saw for size, vigour, and evenness of growth
were a brood of about eight reared by Mr. Whitley at Paignton and these
and their hen foster mother were all running loose in a big garden with
lots of shrubberies and stretches of grass. Mr. Whitley also had a
wonderful brood of some Kaleege which were being similarly reared.
Of the species largely introduced or reintroduced into Europe during
the inter-war period, Mikado, Copper Pheasants, Versicolor,
Imperial, Edwards, Lewis's, etc., have either vanished or become
extremely rare. The Imperials at Leckford before the war were never
bred though both pairs looked healthy. Of Lewis's we possessed only
a male. Edwards is still breeding fairly well, Mikados suffer badly

from infertility. The Copper Pheasants have temperament difficulties
so we will omit them from this examination. In America, I believe,
the breeding stocks of pure Imperial have ceased to exist. Imperial,
Edwards, Lewis's (which is a dark Silver Pheasant), Mikado, and
Versicolor all belong to families which should have been easy to
establish as say the typical Silver and the Golden and probably easier
than Crossoptilans. The above species were almost all very expensive
and were kept by people who took great care of the youngsters and
reared them in moveable coops. To-day pure stocks of nearly all have
ceased to exist or are very rare because the breeding stock is not
prolific. The war has, of course, speeded matters, but they had started
to fade away before the war. The White Crossoptilan was not so
badly hit by the war.
I was talking to Mr. Milligan who is in charge of our Pheasants and
who has had great experience in Pheasant rearing and who has an
unlimited amount of patience with small chicks. We were talking of
the breeding season which in the case of the water fowl has been the
best we have ever had. He said he used to have better fertility and
reared many more Pheasants, but I pointed out that the breeding stock
then used were either wild-caught imported birds which continued
to breed satisfactorily year after year or the first generation bred from
them. If someone possessed a good pair, say of Imperials, which for
six or eight years bred good broods people got the impression that
Imperials were becoming well established in captivity as there were
quite a lot about, but that impression was a false one unless their
children and children's children were still prolific.
The natural fertility of a Pheasant and a duck is similar ; they
both hatch large families for the same reasons and performances should
be comparable. From three Bahama Pintail Ducks, and one of them
an old prewar bird who laid one clutch and her two two-year-old
daughters, 65 Bahama Pintail have been reared this year. Ducks are
easier to rear and are sooner past the difficult stage. I'm not comparing
final results but the numbers hatched per pair. Waterfowl here have
always led a far more natural life than the Pheasants, and the ducklings
live loose on streams after they are a few days old. We undoubtedly
lose a few from vermin, or because they stray, but the survivors are
virile. The amount of exercise taken by a free duckling or by the wild
Pheasant chick in its daily search for insect or live food is quite fan-
tastic. Two hen wild Pheasants reared broods in the watermeadows
and I watched them daily. Two things surprised me, firstly that the
hen Pheasant reared them in a limited territory of about an acre
till they were quite large. I had never had a wild Pheasant under
constant observation and had presumed she j&amp;apos;ust wandered about
wherever her fancy took her. Secondly I was surprised how when
passing over the territory say on my way to and from breakfast I so

often met the hen and her tiny chicks first at one end and then on my
return at the other of her territory.
Last year we had Peafowl chicks reared by a hen first in a coop and
then in a large aviary and the second clutches reared by the Peahens
wandering loose. The latter grew much more quickly than the former.
This year we have the domestic hen loose and her chicks are main-
taining their lead.
Next spring we are going to try an experiment. I am going to rear
a few Pheasants running loose in the garden. I shall pinion them and
when they are grown up turn them out in a large orchard of five or
six acres. We shall catch up the birds at the end of the winter and put
them in aviaries and see whether the fertility of their eggs has improved.
So much for the rearing side of the management.
Now for feeding. I think probably Pheasants in aviaries either eat
too much food or get it too easily. To harp back to the waterfowl and to
the wild Pheasants. Between meals the waterfowl expend a great
deal of energy swimming about and searching for natural food. On
wet days and every evening they wander about the grassy parts of the
pen searching for worms and slugs and in one way or another lead
a pretty active life. The wild Pheasants in late summer and autumn live
fatly and easily on grain, acorns, and beech mast. In winter they work
much harder covering a lot of ground or get a lot of exercise digging
in the drifts of leaves looking for the remaining fruits. By spring they
live on green food and animal food, both of high protein content.
I wonder if it would help if one made Pheasants scratch in litter like
fowls for their living and in spring fed them a great variety of green
foods and a small amount of mash rich in protein rather than on the
more easily given grain and mash.
That Pheasants can be bred one generation after another when
intensively kept and reared I am fully aware, but under such conditions
they must receive very different treatment from the general run.
Mme Malisoux, for example, continues to rear Satyr and Blyth's
Tragopans in fair numbers from very limited breeding stocks. And
her stocks have been captive bred for a number of generations.
This article is not intended to be dogmatic. I do not know the reasons
for the extinction of such species as Imperial or Lewis's Pheasants in
captivity. I only wish someone would tell me. But that there is
something lacking in the way Pheasants are kept in captivity is obvious
from the long lists of disappearances of various species which cannot
be put down solely to the difficulties of war-time conditions. They
had in 1939 already started to fade away. Lack of new blood cannot
be the sole reason when such well established species as the Brown
Grossoptilan and Swinhoe have all descended from a very few indiv-
duals. Different species also must vary enormously in their ability to
adapt themselves to captivity, but when one species thrives and

Grossoptilan one must, I think, compare the management of the

THE KALIJS, SILVER PHEASANTS, FIREBACKS
AND THEIR ALLIES
(Genus Lophura)
By J. Delacour
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.995817571428571" page_id="56311957"  page_num="213" year="" vol="">
(Abstracted and adapted from The Ibis, 1949, pp. 188-200.)
The ten species of Pheasants which I include in the Genus Lophura
have been distributed among a variable number of genera by different
authors in the course of the last hundred years or so. Previously the
known forms had been generally united under the antedated generic
names Euplocomus. These species have in common a number of
general, deep-seated characteristics both morphological and biological,
but because of well-marked secondary peculiarities almost everyone
of them was later on set up as a monotypic genus. Such splitting,
however, was then perfectly understandable in accordance with the
fashion of the day. But modern tendencies for the simplification of
nomenclature, as well as new facts such as the discovery of the Imperial
Pheasant and a better knowledge of the morphology and behaviour
of several other species, have altered my viewpoint. We have now
learned by the study of more adequate series and by new observations
of live specimens, that the species inornata , edwardsi , and imperialis
provide links between other forms. I am convinced that all ten
species are related to a sufficient degree to be considered as forming
a single natural genus.
It must be remembered that the large and brightly coloured game
birds commonly called " Pheasants " clearly belong to a small number
(16) of very distinct, well-defined group of species, none of which is
very closely connected with the others. It is therefore inconsistent
to divide any of such a natural group of obviously near related species
into several genera, as it creates a false notion of real affinities. May
I repeat once again that the genus expresses relationship and the
species differences.
The Pheasants of the genus Lophura contain some fairly generalized
and rather primitive forms, and also very highly specialized ones.
They are heavy, fowl-like birds with compressed, roof-shaped tails
like the Junglefowls, Eared Pheasants, and Crested Argus, and large
erectile wattles covering the face around the eye resembling those of
Eared Pheasants, Cheer, Long-tailed, and Common Pheasants. The
legs are longer than the middle toe, strong and armed with a long,
sharp, white spur in the male, exceptionally also found in the female.

The bill is moderate in size. The wings are rounded, the first primary
short, the second equal to the ninth or tenth, the fifth and sixth the
longest. There are no complicated ornaments such as ruffs, long,
disintegrated hackles, ocelli, etc., but the feathers of the back and
rump are broad, truncated, and fringed with metallic colours in most
species, many of which are crested. Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon)
are probably the nearest genus.
The sexes are conspicuously different. The males show various
tones of grey, chestnut, fulvous and blue, black and white, with the
addition of coppery red, crimson, yellow and maroon in some species.
Females are brown of different shades, with or without markings, and
have indications of spurs only, the one exception being the black,
cock-like hen of L. erythrophthalma ; the face wattles are smaller. Three
species are fully crested in both sexes ; in four the cock alone possesses
a conspicuous tuft, while three others are entirely crestless ; crests
vary greatly in structure, shape, and size. Face wattles are blue in
two species, scarlet in all others ; they are usually covered with small
papillae, and have a velvety aspect ; when fully extended they show
several lobes, differing according to species, which in one case become
extremely long. The compressed tail consists normally of sixteen
feathers, occasionally reduced to fourteen in two species ( inornata,
erythrophthalma ), while the most elaborate member of the genus ( bulweri)
has up to thirty-two ; the tail moult processes from outside inward.
In two crestless species ( erythrophthalma , inornata ) the tail is hen-like,
short, not pointed, straight, the central pair of feathers shorter than
the third in erythrophthalma , as they are also in ignita and diardi , which
have pointed and curved rectrices. In edwardsi , the tail is rounded
and straight. In four others ( leucomelana, nycthemera , imperialism swinhoei)
the central pointed pair is the longest, but the tail varies much in size
and shape. In bulweri the rectrices are tremendously developed and
multiplied.
All the downy chicks have the same general pattern : crown and
upper parts brown of various shades, with a dark patch or line on the
crown, two darker lines from eye to nape, and two whitish bands on
the sides of the back ; under parts pale buff or whitish, the breast and
sides tinged with brown.
Gallopheasants live at low or moderate altitudes up to 11,000 feet,
in forest and jungle, on the foothills and lower ranges of the Himalayas,
from the Indus River, to Bhutan, Assam, Burma, Southern China,
Formosa, Hainan, Indo-China, Siam, Malaya, Sumatra, and Borneo.
Their centre of dispersion is probably Central Annam, where four
species are found within a small area ( nycthemera , imperialism edwardsi ,
and diardi). Three species occur in Siam, in Sumatra, and in Borneo,
but at different altitudes and in different parts, and only two may be
found together at any place. There are two species in Malaya,

Tenasserim, and the rest of Indo-China. Elsewhere one species only
lives in any one district. There are none in Ceylon and Java.
The more specialized birds show little or no geographical variation,
but the others are split into a variable, sometimes high number of
subspecies. All species are very distinct, with the exception of two,
leucomelana and nycthemera , which replace one another geographically.
Such important and stable characteristics, however, as the colour of
the legs, the shape of the crest, still more so the fact that birds of
the western leucomelana group mature the first year, while those of the
eastern nycthemera group become adult the second year only, and the
presence of unstable hybrid populations where both meet east of
the Irrawaddy in Burma, have induced me to consider them as two
separate species constituting a superspecies.
All Gallopheasants have similar life habits. They are found in
forests, bamboos, and thick bush where they are often difficult to see,
but many of them are not particularly wary nor wild. They go in
pairs and small flocks, often noisy, and some species can be found at
times on roads and clearings close to the edges of the jungle. Opinions
differ as to whether they are monogamous or polygamous, and do
really pair in the wild state. They are usually monogamous in con-
finement but, loose in a park, Silver Pheasants are polygamous, and
I have often met in Indo-China with parties of that species, and also
of the Siamese Firebacks, composed of one or several cocks and three
to five hens, even in the early spring, which may have been still
unbroken family groups. Gallopheasants live and nest on the ground,
roosting on trees at night, or when frightened. They are omnivorous.
The cocks are very quarrelsome, and when tame they will often
attack even human beings.
Hen Gallopheasants lay, as a rule, a fairly large clutch of eggs,
four to fourteen, in sheltered spots, without making much of a nest.
Incubation lasts from twenty-one to twenty-five days, twenty-four in
most cases. The eggs are spotless except for tiny white pit marks,
rather short and pointed at one end, varying from creamy white to
deep rosy buff.
The voice differs in tone according to species, but all have a variety
of notes, and the male emits a long-drawn shrill whistle followed by
loud and deep, ventriloquial boomings ; the hens utter a repeated,
deep "whooff". The cocks have the habit of beating their wings
at a fast, vibrating speed, producing a whirring noise ; otherwise,
with the exception of the elaborate display of bulweri, and to a lesser
degree of swinhoei , they have a fairly simple courtship, mostly lateral,
puffing out the lower back and rump, spreading vertically the tail
feathers, raising their crest or crown feathers, and expanding the face
wattles. They walk around the hens, clucking and booming, and
shaking the tail. In L. swinhoei , the courtship is more elaborate ; the

cock bobs his head up and down and jumps about jerkily ; its face
wattles extended as in all the others, but consisting of four lobes
instead of the usual two ; the upper one is long, upstraight, showing
well above the crown. The wonderful display of bulweri has been
watched, described, and figured by O. Heinroth at the Berlin Zoo
(, Journ.fiir Orn ., 86, 1938, the Avicultural Magazine , 1938, pp. 177-180,
and L'Oiseau , 1938, pp. 365-7). The bird expands his long face
wattles in a sort of a stiff, arched ribbon, 8 inches long, hiding com-
pletely the beak ; the huge white tail is spread into a vertical, flat
disk which reaches the nape in front and rattles on the soil behind.
He struts slowly about and stands still with a jerk when the hen comes
close up to him. Elaborate as the pose is, anyone acquainted with the
ordinary display of the average Gallopheasant can recognize the
basic similarity of the performance.
The greatest caution must be used when interpreting the courtship
displays of Pheasants. Particularly, no undue importance attaches
to the fact that it is frontal or lateral. This depends entirely upon the
shape of the tail and varies in closely linked species. When the
rectrices are set horizontally and the tail is flat, the frontal display
is the rule, as in Peacocks ( Pavo ), Great Argus (Argusianus) , most of
the Peacock Pheasants ( Polyplectron ) and Monauls (Lophophorus ),
which all spread their tail. Even Elliot's and Mikado Pheasants
( Syrmaticus ) have been exceptionally observed to do it. But species
with a more or less roof-shaped tail cannot spread it frontally ; they
have to content themselves with a lateral courtship, which, of course,
also exists in the others as a preliminary stage. It had no deep signifi-
cance as to natural relationship. Rheinhart's Argus ( Rheinartia) and
the Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasant (P. chalcurum ), for instance, close
relatives of the Great Argus and of the other Polyplectrons, have a
lateral display because their tail is narrow and compressed. Yet in
every other way they all resemble one another. No one has so far
observed the display of Polyplectron inopinatum, which, morphologically
speaking, holds an exactly intermediate position between P. chalcurum
and the other more specialized species of the genus. It would be
interesting to ascertain the mode of its courtship.
In ordinary circumstances, Bulwer's Pheasants resemble Siamese
Firebacks in shape and action ; they also have thin, high legs, and
their rectrices are curved outwards ; but contrary to diardi , they
always remain wary and wild, and they are usually silent. They
have smooth blue wattles like ignita. As Hachisuka has pointed out
(,Zoologica , 26, 1941), besides some relationship with diardi and ignita ,
bulweri has strong affinities with the Blue Pheasants ( edwardsi , imperialism
swinhoei). The enormous white tail of the cock is modestly suggested
by the large white central rectrices of swinhoei , whose face wattles
begin to show long lobes, announcing the tremendous ones of bulweri.

J. DELACOUR-THE KALIJS, SILVER PHEASANTS, FIREBAGKS 217
The metallic, fringed feathers of the back and rump are similar to
those of the males of all Blue Pheasants and Firebacks, only a little
more modified. The female bulweri recalls very closely in colour and
pattern those of edwardsi and imperialism differing mostly in the higher
legs, the blue face wattles and in the greater number of tail feathers.
She has no crest, as in swinhoei , edwardsi , imperialism diardi , erythrophthalmam
and inornata, and the male is also devoid of it as in the last two species.
It must be noted that the difference in the number of tail feathers is
not generally regarded as a generic characteristic in Gallus or in
Crossoptilon. L. bulweri is, in fact, intermediate in a general way
between the Firebacks and the Blue Pheasants. I do not consider
that the extreme development of the lobes of the wattles, nor that of
the number of tail feathers, both ornamental features, are very ancient
characters, and I prefer to place bulweri in the genus Lophura , of which
it constitutes the most highly specialized form.
Formerly there seemed to be quite a gap between the Firebacks
erythrophthalmam ignita , diardi ), the Blue Pheasants ( [swinhoei , edwardsi ),
and the Kalijs and Silver Pheasants ( leucomelana , nycthemera ), mostly
due to differences in the crest, the shape of the tail, the colour pattern
the shiny fringes and metallic hues of the first two groups varying a
great deal from the more sombre hues of the last-named birds. But
the discovery of inornata in Sumatra and of imperialis in Annam has
changed the whole picture. On the one hand, inornatam a mountain
species, is obviously related to the lowland erythrophthalma which it
represents at higher altitudes, having also a short, straight tail, grey
legs, and lacking a crest in both sexes. On the other hand, it is also
related to edwardsi and imperialis in the dark, blue fringed plumage of
the male and the chestnut dress of the female. The rather short,
straight tail of edwardsi is another indication of relationship with
inornata. But it remains that edwardsi is very close to imperialis and to
swinhoei. Either they all have to be considered congeneric, or to be
placed into three different genera, as it has eventually been proposed
by some authors. At the same time, imperialis no doubt provides a
link between the Blue Pheasants and the Kalijs ( leucomelana ) which
it resembles much, differing only in the presence of blue fringes to
the feathers, the red legs and the lack of a true crest of the female,
which, however, possesses elongated feathers on the crown that are
visible when they are erected. L. imperialis produces completely
fertile hybrids with leucomelana, nycthemera , edwardsi , and swinhoei. It
seems therefore impossible to split generically these species.
L. erythrophthalma, L. ignata, and L. diardi are showing undoubted
relationship in the peculiar metallic coppery-maroon coloration of
the lower back and rump of the males, while the females differ much
in colour, general proportions, shape of the tail, and the presence or
absence of a crest. Inornata certainly links them to edwardsi and

imperialis. They also resemble completely the other Gallopheasants
in voice, behaviour, and life habits. It is therefore appropriate to
place them all in the same genus, for which the name Lophura , the
oldest, must be used.
Experiments on the production of hybrids in captivity have been
conducted for many years ; particularly Professor A. Ghigi has pub-
lished very interesing studies on the subject.
Gamebirds belonging to widely separated genera will produce
hybrids when their mating habits are not too different, but such
hybrids are completely infertile. Others produce partly fertile
hybrids, the males of which breed successfully with females of either
parent species, but the females are either completely sterile and
masculine in appearance, or lay only imperfect eggs which cannot
develop. On the contrary, birds belonging to very closely allied
species and to subspecies of the same species produce completely
fertile hybrids. There are of course intermediate cases between these
divisions.
As far as Lophura is concerned, hybrids between the species of
Kalijs and Silver Pheasants ( leucomelana , nycthemera ) and of Blue
Pheasants ( imperialis , edwardsi , swinhoei) are completely fertile ; those
between Kalijs, Silver, and Blue Pheasants on the one hand, and the
Firebacks ( ignita , erythrophthalma , diardi) on the other, are partly
fertile, the male only being capable of breeding. No hybrids between
the different Firebacks, or between any other species and inornata or
bulweri, have yet been obtained. Hybrids between Lophura nycthemera
and Crossoptilon, Chrysolophus pictus , Syrmaticus reevesi , and Phasianus
colchicus are partly fertile, that is to say the males are, while the females
are sterile. Hybrids between Lophura and any other genus other than
those named above are sterile as far as we know.
The various degrees of fecundity in hybrids are certainly a good
indication of relationship between the parent species. But I do not
think that they can always be used as a final criterion for generic
division. I believe that they undoubtedly indicate definite affinities,
but they constitute only one of many characteristics, morphological
and biological, which have to be taken into consideration for a natural
systematic arrangement of the genera and species.

By S. Lag a
(Translated and reprinted from Ornithologie, bulletin of the Gercle
Ornithologique de Belgique)
In 1943 I obtained, quite by accident, a somewhat extraordinary
cross ; a male Satyr Tragopan (T. sartyra) and a female Swinhoe
Pheasant (Lophura swinhoe ) mated, and I possess the result, two males
and one female.
This is how it came about. I placed the two birds in a small aviary
16 square metres in size, also occupied by Budgerigars. The male
Tragopan was three years old, the offspring of an imported pair of
these birds. The female Swinhoe was six years old and of unknown
origin. Put together in January, these birds mated during February,
and at the beginning of March the female began to lay. She laid five
eggs only. The eggs were placed under a Peking bantam, and after
twenty-seven days four chicks were hatched, one of which unfortu-
nately died on emerging from the egg. The fifth egg was clear.
The three young hatched in the middle of April, and developed quite
normally so far as their feeding and growth was concerned. These
chicks were very vigorous and hardy ; at eight days they were already
able to perch to the great distress of their Peking mother. From their
birth to the ages of eight months they lived in a small aviary of 2
metres by 2 metres containing a privet bush, in the branches of
which they passed the night.
The food of the parents in this time of restrictions was not rich,
they received every day a handful of seeds and an abundance of green
food. As for the youngsters, up to the age of two months I gave them
three times a day a mash composed of stale bread finely crumbled,
scrambled egg, white cheese, some ants' eggs all mixed together with
lettuce and finely chopped carrots.
The cross was not intended or desired. It was only owing to lack
of space that the birds were put in the same aviary.
The hybrids so produced are objects of astonishment for the Pheasant
fancier. The two cocks resemble their Tragopan father ; they are
high on their legs, and have the head of a Tragopan. The young
female on the other hand resembles the Swinhoe of which she has
the general characteristics. I have the impression that the coloration
of their plumage is not completely developed at the age of one year,
and I am anxious to see what they look like next year.

transferred to the Antwerp Zoo. Mr. Walter Van den bergh, Director
of the Antwerp Zoo, writing in 1949, says :\0x25A0--*
" We received the three hybrids, two cocks and hen, but the hen
died in 1944. The hen showed the characteristics of a female Tragopan,
being a uniform brown colour, and the upper mandible of the beak
forming a regular curve with the skull.
One of the males was sent to Dr. Valle, Blerick lez-Venloo, in
Holland, but the other male is still in the Antwerp Zoo, and doing well.
The following is a description of it :--
Head. --Beak dark horn colour ; bare skin round the eye, of which
the iris is brown. Cheeks red mixed with purple. Crest black at the
base of the beak ; the feathers, which are lancet-shaped, are orange
in colour, with black tips ; with every 3 to 4 mm. a spot along the
edges. The back of the neck is black speckled with chestnut red
shading into dark chestnut red on the back. The feathers have chestnut
tips and have a light metallic reflection.
Wings. --Lesser wing-coverts dark, the middle being chestnut ;
median wing-coverts the same, but the patch in the middle smaller ;
metallic reflections. Flight feathers dark brown, spotted with chestnut,
with dark tips.
Belly. --Velvety black with here and there, irregularly, the tips of
the feathers chestnut red.
Tail. --Like the flight feathers.
Rump. --Black with metallic reflections.
Feet. --Flesh coloured."

bird, which I shall be pleased to send to any member wishing to look
at them.-- Ed.)

SOME NOTES ON COMMON AND GOLDEN
PHEASANTS

Despite my protests that, as one who has only kept two species of
Pheasants, the Common (P. colchicus) and the Golden (C. pictus ) in
my back garden, for my writings on the subject to appear among the
works of those whose vast aviaries are filled with the rarest galliformes
from the snow-capped Himalayas and the steaming Malayan jungles
would be as inappropriate as the fabled daw among the Peacocks,
I have been requested to write for our Pheasant number. Kind
reader, bear this in mind and if grieved at the waste of paper, direct
your wrath solely at the head of our fair Editor !
Most of us have heard of the ancient Greek philosopher, who, when
asked by the vainglorious Eastern potentate if he was not amazed at the
latter's magnificence replied to the effect that having already seen the
Pheasant he could no longer be amazed at mere human finery. Times
have changed, and in a more materialistic age most people see in the
Pheasant not a divine epitome of beauty but merely so much edible
flesh, or more often an instrument to satisfy the love of killing for
killing's sake which, strong in so many mammals, finds its most intense
expression in the arch-mammal, man. Still, whether appreciated or
not, the Common Pheasant, in all its many races and even in the
mongrel product of their injudicious interbreeding in the interests of
sport, stands now, as ever, as one of the world's most beautiful birds.
I obtained my first Common Pheasant when in my very early teens.
A fellow criminal and myself had wandered into a game preserve in
search of grass snakes, and were watching the Pheasants scattering at
our approach, when suddenly I saw one run into a small bush growing
against the wire fence round the field. Gould I catch it against the
wire ? Would it be foolish enough to try to go straight through instead
of breaking out to either side ? It was ! I could ! But when I held
the gorgeous bird in my hands I could hardly credit my good fortune,
and my friend was hardly less excited. No pangs of conscience worried
us but we realized that a hasty withdrawal from the scene was
expedient, and returned home triumphant. To go to catch snakes
and bring home a live cock Pheasant ! Did ever the gods so smile
on mere mortals before ? The Pheasant was placed in a large garage
that had been converted into an aviary and housed several small
birds. He was evidently a " reared " bird as he soon settled down
and became fairly tame. Unfortunately, his life was short as after
I had had him a week I slipped when near him in the aviary and,
throwing out my arms, startled the Pheasant who at once rocketed up
and struck the roof with such force that he fell dead. Needless to say,
more visits were paid to the game preserve, but without avail. Never

222 D. GOODWIN-NOTES ON COMMON AND GOLDEN PHEASANTS
again did a Pheasant run into the same bush, and elsewhere the
bushes were all on the wrong (woodland) side of the wire. On the
last visit we came upon scores of Pheasants in a low-lying field and
adjacent wood, but not one could we catch. After half an hour of
vain pursuit and empty stratagems we began to have misgivings. Not
without reason, as the constant whirring and cok-cok-cokking of
startled Pheasants, intermingled with the alarm notes of Jays and
Blackbirds, was enough to awake the dead. A quarter of a mile away
from the safety of a copse on some rising ground we looked back.
From all points of the compass a posse of determined-looking men
were converging upon the scene of our late endeavours. In the joy of
our timely escape we forgot to grieve at our failure but decided that
the place was now too dangerous for any further attempts.
Some years later I reared a brood of Common Pheasants under a
bantam hen. In those days I had more time than I have now, and
devoted much of it to tempting the finicky appetites of the lovely
delicate little birds with chopped egg custard, young lettuce, small
green caterpillars, and other dainties. Fortune favoured me in that
none died, but as they were running loose in the garden, some vanished,
doubtless borne off by some furred or feathered predator. Five hens
and two cocks were reared, the latter differing greatly in appearance,
one being a very dark, lustrous coppery purple bird but with a broad
white collar and the other a rather lack-lustre c torquatus '-like specimen
but with only a narrow neck-ring. They ran free in the garden with
their wings clipped, and were delightfully tame and friendly, with
none of the nervousness that these birds often show. Alas, a fox got
five of them one night as they roosted in a high privet hedge. Of the
two hens left, one--which had been left full-winged--disappeared the
following April. The other commenced laying on the gth April and
continued until well into June, a total of forty-nine eggs. She made
no attempt to sit, her method being to scrape out a nest, lay a dozen
or so eggs in it, and then start again. The eggs were all sterile, since
although she often solicited a cock Golden Pheasant kept with her,
he did not reciprocate.
This brings me to the Golden Pheasant, a bird not more beautiful
than the Common Pheasant but more strikingly coloured and although
so brilliantly clad yet without any clashing of the bright colours in
which the male is arrayed. As with the Common and Reeves' Pheasants,
the female's intricate cryptic markings are as beautiful as, and a perfect
foil for, the male's brilliance. This bird has become semi-domesticated
with all the powers of resistance to stale ground, poor feeding, and
close confinement usually attendant on this state. Nor has it yet had
its natural beauty ruined by being bred by fanciers into all sorts of
unnatural and unpleasing varieties as have most domestic birds.
Young Golden Pheasants are supremely easy to rear. Although they

D. GOODWIN--NOTES ON COMMON AND GOLDEN PHEASANTS 223
look at first even more delicate than Common Pheasant chicks they
are (in my limited experience) far hardier and less fastidious. I feed
mine at first on egg custard and green fly, but after a few days get
them to bread and milk and wood-ant cocoons, adding chopped
peanuts and a little grain from about the third week. They are kept
in a pen on the lawn and moved daily. No doubt at all that complete
liberty would be better for them, but it would be no kindness, as if
they are free when young they seldom take kindly to aviary life later.
Also, as in addition to the natural hazards in the way of Sparrow-
hawks, Owls, and Crows, one also has to contend with the far more
numerous and destructive dog and cat, it is much safer to confine them.
I might add that I have known Goldens (some thirty of them) reared
without mishap that were confined to small pens seldom moved--
never till the floor was a quagmire of mud and excreta--and fed on
hard corn and maggots tipped straight from a bucket of rotten fish
without any preliminary scouring. I do not advise such a system,
but it shows how tough the birds are. As liberty birds I think Goldens
would be a great success in a large garden surrounded by its own
estate, but in a smaller place they sooner or later fly off at some alarm ;
when they try to walk back they find several wire fences in the way
and are soon hopelessly lost. If they reach woodland they may survive
for some time, but in a region of gardens and wire fences they are
soon slain by man or dog. Goldens are usually perfectly inoffensive
towards other birds, but it must be admitted that like other Pheasants
they foul the ground more than a little and destroy every vestige of grass
(except in a very large aviary). Also, if one rears many young ones
one is liable to find them rather a responsibility, as it is difficult to
find good homes for them as a rule, whilst if one aspires to recoup his
fortunes by selling them he will find that buying and selling are two
vastly different things.
The common practice of rearing Golden Pheasants and others
under domestic fowls although justifiable in the case of rare species
where the number of young reared is the main consideration is
otherwise to be strongly condemned. The rearing of the young is,
or should be, one of the most interesting stages of the birds' life cycle
and no one genuinely interested in the study of birds ought, unless
compelled, to short-circuit it in the interests of gain or convenience.
There are also other considerations : most birds tend to become to
a greater or lesser degree sexually fixated on the species that rears
them, and I think much of the disappointments caused through cock
Pheasants refusing to mate with, or even killing hens of their own
species, could be traced back to their having been reared by bantam
foster-mothers. Certainly much remains to be learnt of the breeding
behaviour of even a common species like the Golden. In the Ibis for
April, 1949, I recorded how in 1948 my hen Golden Pheasants sat

for some twenty-four days without leaving the nest or taking food or
water. This was repeated in 1949 and I feel sure represents the normal
behaviour of the species in a wild state. I would appeal to all Pheasant
keepers to let their birds lay, retain their eggs as laid and sit in a
natural manner without any attempt to entice them from the nest.
Under these circumstances I think it probable that other species would
be found to incubate continuously, since it is most unlikely that the
habit is confined to four birds so distinct as the Eider Duck, the Argus,
the Golden Pheasant, and the Emu, which appear to be the only ones
in which it has been recorded. Unlike my hen Common Pheasant,
none of my Goldens has ever attempted to make a nest prior to
becoming broody. True, after she has laid the hen picks up leaves
or straws and throws them backwards over her shoulder (an odd habit
shared apparently by galliformes and charadriiformes) but nothing in
the nature of a nest results. Nor is any attempt made to protect the
eggs. I have seen a Jay stand by a laying Pheasant and break open
her egg the moment it was laid without her showing the least sign of
resentment or distress. Once she goes broody, however, all is changed.
The eggs are gathered carefully together, a hollow shaped out and
lined with any debris within reach and a few downy feathers, and
woe betide any intruder.
Few things are more appealing than a hen Golden with her chicks.
For the first few days she does little but brood them, but after that
she is most assiduous in calling them to any titbit she finds. This she
usually holds with lowered head until a chick takes it from her bill,
although rarely she may drop it on the ground like a domestic fowl.
She continues to act in this manner for some four months or more
until the chicks are quite as large as she is. What is more strange is
that sometimes hens that have not reared chicks or even incubated
eggs will in late spring commence to use the food call exactly as if
they had chicks to feed. I have been struck both by how quickly
other Golden Pheasants and Jays in the same aviary learn to profit
by this behaviour, and the fact that it is quite obvious that the hen
so calling does not do so with the intention of feeding such aviary
companions. Even a cock Golden Pheasant will sometimes call in this
way, just as the sight of an egg may induce in him the feminine actions
of" feeling " it with his bill and throwing leaves, etc., over his shoulder
like a female does after laying. The warning notes of the Golden
when she sees some predatory animal, or more often when she imagines
that she has seen one--the low startled " Tlook ! Tlook ! 55 followed
by the high-pitched squealing " eeee ! " must be well known, and
owing to its power of alarming other birds well hated, by all who
have kept the species, but used by a hen at liberty with chicks it has
an even more potent effect. As the squeal is emitted so the chicks
scatter, some diving into near-by herbage, others flying some distance

before dropping to earth. Not until she is quite satisfied that danger
is past, will their mother call them up again. Nor, until she does,
will the chicks shake off their terror. If, as sometimes happens, they
have flown into a neighbour's garden and one attempts to catch them,
although a few minutes previously they were tame and unafraid they
are now panic stricken and if aware that they have been spotted, dash
or fly madly away at one's approach. Similar behaviour can be noted
in active chicks of other species. It is as though the impulse to escape,
once set in motion by the alarm notes of the parent, cannot be
" switched off" except by her note of reassurance. As with the Jay
and domestic fowl (and I suspect most other birds) the " Hawk-
alarm " is entirely different from the normal one, being in this case
a very low moaning note, barely audible at a few yards. With adults
the bird seeing a Hawk keeps quite still as it gives the alarm, whereas
for any other predator, real or imaginary, it makes no effort to conceal
itself but flies up on to a perch, or if the object is at a distance or not
clearly visible will make a cautious but noisy approach. The reason
is obvious since no mammalian predator (excluding man) has much
chance of capturing a Pheasant once the latter has seen it and it
matters little how conspicuous the bird makes itself. With a bird-of-
prey the case is of course very different if the Pheasant is in the open,
and in this case it is biologically undesirable that the Hawk should
see or hear it. Pheasants, like Doves, often seem to find the sight of
crippled or sick birds of their own species displeasing and usually vent
their distaste on the luckless bird that arouses it. I have seen one of
my hen Goldens deliberately kill a sickly young bird that kept falling
over. The hen Goldens' defensive reactions are aroused by the cries
of a chick caught by some predator ; care must be taken when picking
up a chick as apart from the unpleasantness of having an angry
Pheasant fly into one's face, which of course will only happen if one
holds the chick near it, she is as likely in her agitation to peck the
chick as to peck the hand that holds it. The automatic nature of this
reaction was well illustrated when I caught up a cock Golden Pheasant
in an aviary in which a ten-year-old hen was sitting on chipping eggs.
At his first squeal of fear she hurtled across the floor of the aviary
and attacked me furiously. The automatic defending reactions having
evidently pre-dated the actual emergence of her young.
Apart from detailed study of its habits I think aviculturists,
particularly those blessed with money, space, or time in abundance,
should set themselves two targets with regard to the Golden Pheasant,
(i) To breed for a ## homing " propensity at least equal to that of
the domestic fowl, and (2) to set themselves resolutely against the
temptation to breed for size or abnormalities either of form or plumage
and let the little brilliant wild Golden be their physical model of
perfection.

most experienced breeder of Parrot-like birds in the country ; Lady
Spencer-Jones, wife of the Astronomer Royal, and Miss Yvonne
Arnaud, animal lover, pianist, and actress.
Mr. G. T. lies showed a colour film, Wild Life in Captivity, taken
at the Belle Vue Zoo, Manchester. Mainly devoted to animals it was
of such interest that it could not fail to appeal to all. The whole of the
Zoo was covered and there were specially interesting pictures of a
baby Tiger, Hippopotami, Miss Arnaud with a couple of Elephants,
and of the unique Gerenuk or Giraffe-necked Gazelle. The birds shown
included Flamingoes, Bateleur Eagle, Nubian Vulture, a White
Peacock, bred at Leckford, displaying ; and a 7 weeks old Ostrich,
which had already developed a passion for cigarette ends and tram
tickets ! Mr. lies remarked that a Laughing Kingfisher had lived in
the Gardens since 1921, and that it, and a companion, had a fondness
for grapes. A second film was devoted to Continental Zoos, and
conveyed a good idea of the Vincennes Zoological Park and the
Gardens of Zurich and Basle.
The appreciation of the audience was shown by the sustained
applause at the end of the films.
The Chairman thanked Mr. lies for giving what had proved such
a very interesting description of the various Zoos and congratulated
him on the excellence of his photography.
The date of the next meeting is nth January 1950.

Since first published in 1929, our American contemporary Aviculture
has suffered many vicissitudes. Jean Delacour has recently been
elected President of the Avicultural Society of America, and we
confidently look forward to an ever-increasing improvement in the
fortunes of this Magazine.
In 1908 David Seth-Smith made and brought to England an
important collection of Australian fauna--so important, in fact, that
the Zoological Society awarded him its Silver Medal. A link with
that collection has just been broken by the death of a Banksian
Cockatoo, after 41 years' residence in the Parrot House.
W. J. C. Frost has returned from New Guinea with a good collection
of birds. Included were thirteen male Birds of Paradise, ten Great

and three King, twelve Crowned Pigeons, four Pleasing Lories, six
Gold-crowned Bulbuls, etc. Needless to say none was available to
private aviculturists !
On his return to America, Frank Buck writes : " I did not make
the picture (They Kill to Live) while in Malaya. The Communists
and Chinese gang robbers up in the jungle, north of Singapore, were
too tough to attempt it. Hope to do it next Spring. But I did ship
back a small shipment of animals and reptiles, some fine Hornbills,
and a few other birds."
Peter Scott returned by air from the Arctic on 12th September.
The expedition was wholly successful. Some two hundred square
miles of tundra were put on the map ; much valuable data collected
on the Wildfowl ; and the customs and mode of life of a little-known
Eskimo tribe, the Kogmuits, studied. Six Ross's Snow Geese and

REVIEW
AUDUBON'S AMERICAN BIRDS. By Sacheverell Sitwell.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.96663235" page_id="56311974"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
B. T. Batsford, Ltd. 6 l 6 d. net.
This is a welcome addition to the Batsford Colour Books Series. The
sixteen coloured plates are representative of the five hundred water-
colour paintings in Audubon's great work. Printed in the Netherlands
by a new method, the originals are reproduced with complete fidelity.
Twelve pages of Introduction and Notes have been contributed by
Sacheverell Sitwell. He tells us little or nothing of Audubon that is
new, but he presents his subject in a manner that assists the reader to
appreciate Audubon and his work.
It is perhaps a pity that a full quarter of the very limited letterpress
should be devoted to lost breeds of fighting cocks and famous cockers,
Red Indian braves and Maori warriors, interesting though they are.
Under two pages are allotted to notes on the plates. In such a very
limited space one does not expect to find many " inaccuracies ". It
is all the more surprising, therefore, to read of the Summer or Wood
Duck " The blue, and black and white feathers of its wing shafts put
this Duck into the same category of quaint beauty as the Carolina
and the Mandarin ". It seems hardly necessary to liken " sponsa "
to " sponsa " !

Grey-necked Picathartes.
I was most interested in Mr. Webb's article on the Grey-necked Picathartes
(\0x25A0Picathartes Oreas) in the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine, as I had some

experience with this species in the summer of 1949, during my collecting trip to the
British Cameroons.
My base camp was at Mamfe, approximately 70 miles north of Kumba, where
Mr. Webb obtained his specimen. On the 25th July a native arrived from Eshobi,
a small village some 4 miles north of Mamfe in the heart of the forest, with two young
Picathartes, both of which were dead. They were both fully fledged, and had been

taken from the same nest ; my notes, taken at the time, record that they did not
differ from the adult in colouration, except that the bare skin on the head and neck
was yellowish flushed with pink, in place of the vivid colouration of the adult bird.
The colony from which these birds were taken was situated on an overhanging rock
far in the forest, some miles from Eshobi.
The hunter returned on the 29th July with an adult Picathartes, together with the
nest and two eggs on which it had been sitting. Both these eggs contained well-
developed embryos. On the 30th another adult bird was brought in with its nest and
two eggs, both of these, unfortunately, were badly cracked. These also contained
embryos, though not in such an advanced state of development as the previous two.
Thus it seems reasonably certain that these birds lay only two eggs ; whether the fact
that both fully fledged young, and eggs, were found in the same colony indicates more
than one brood is a moot point. Both the adult birds died in August of mycosis,
within a few days of leaving Tiko. Both these proved to be female.
I may add that I have sent one fledgeling and an egg to the Natural History Museum.

The Hawaiian Goose : Early History in England.
It may be of interest to some readers to have Jean Delacour's opening remarks on
page 130 amplified.
Sclater (P.#.S., 1880, 504) writes : " This species was originally based by Mr.
Vigors on a pair of birds living in the Society's Gardens, to which they were presented
by Lady Glengale in 1832 (see P.^.S., 1833, p. 63, and Rep. of Council, 1833, p. 13).
In 1834 a pair was also received by Lord Derby at Knowsley (see P.g.S., 1834, p. 41).
They bred in both places ; and in subsequent years our pair and their descendants
bred frequently in the Society's Gardens." Sclater then lists 38 dates, ranging from
7th May, 1835, to 23rd May, 1871, on which this Goose was bred in the Gardens
(see also Mitchell, Z 00 Garden Guide , 1858, p. 15). The Earl of Derby appears to have
been the first breeder as in P.^.S., 1834, 41, there is a note in which he describes how
his female laid her first egg on 5th March, 1834, followed by three others on the
7th, 9th, and nth. Two goslings were hatched on 13th April and one on the 14th.
Two soon died, but the third flourished, and in P.^.S., 1834, 81, we read that " it is
now fully as large as the parents, and nearly resembles them in plumage ".
Five home-bred birds were included in the Knowsley Sale, 1851, teste the Sale
Catalogue.

Breeding Records of Jays.
Derek Goodwin's graphic description of the nesting of his Jays caused me to refer
to my Breeding Records. I find I have only two entries. Wesley T. Page includes it in
his Species which have reared young (1914) without, of course, any reference. Dr. W. T.
Greene, British Birds for Cages and Aviaries, p. 122 (1899) says :
" The writer is acquainted with a case in which a pair of tame Jays nested success-
fully in an aviary (see Frontispiece, from a photograph by Mr. W. Bush, F.G.S.) ;
and that such naturally shy birds should have done so under such circumstances says
much for their owner's management and treatment ..." The photograph is titled
"Jay sitting on nest in aviary ".
The foregoing are far from satisfactory. It is quite possible there are other records
and I would be interested to learn of any.
