By Kerry A. Muller, Manager, Bird Division, National Zoological
Park, Smithsonian Institution, U.S.A.
There are few, if any, groups of birds that have been more thoroughly
described and discussed by aviculturists than the finches, Fringillidae
and Ploceidae. As a child, my early interest in birds began with a pair
of zebra finches, and I was soon obtaining and propagating many other
species and avidly reading every scrap of information I could find
regarding them, such as A. B. Butler's Foreign Finches in Captivity and the
innumerable articles in Avicultural Magazine, Foreign Birds , and Birds
Illustrated , as well as many books dealing with birds of foreign countries.
In October, 1965, the National Zoological Park received a generous
donation of several rare species of birds from the collection of Mr.
Edward Marshall Boehm of Trenton, New Jersey, and I was surprised
to find included in the lot one beautiful male finch of a species with
which I was totally unfamiliar. Then early this year in Ecuador, I
obtained 20 more birds of this species, and after rather laborious
checking (with other members of the ornithological staff of the
Smithsonian Institution), they were finally identified.
The species is commonly known as the Crimson Finch, Rhodospingus
cruentus, and ranges in the arid tropical zone from western Ecuador to
north-western Peru (Charles Hellmayr, A Catalogue of the Birds of the
Americas). The males are extremely attractive in their coloration and
in my opinion are, with the exception of some of the American Buntings,
the most beautiful of the South American finches. My first impression
was that the bright crimson and black plumage closely resembles that
of the male Vermillion Flycatcher, Pyrocephalus rubinus.
In size, the species is approximately 4J inches in length and is very
similar in body proportions to the common Zebra Finch. The male
has a bright crimson crown, chin, throat, and breast which fades to a
paler orange shade on the belly, sides, flanks, and under tail-coverts.
The forehead, nape, back, rump, upper tail-coverts, tail, auriculars,
lores, side neck, scapulars, and wing-coverts are a dull black. The
lower (proximal) half of the main vane of the nine primaries and first
six secondaries is white, while the distal half, the shaft, and the outer
vane are black, as are the remaining secondaries. When the wings are

folded the white areas are not seen. However, they form a flash
pattern in flight. The eyes are jet-black and the legs and feet slate-grey.
The beak is a combination of slate-grey and horn.
The female of the species has all areas that are red in the male
replaced with a golden buff colour, with the exception of the crown.
The areas that are black in the male are olive-brown in the female. In
appearance, she is much like a female Pileated Finch, Coryphospingus
pileatus , or perhaps a female Varied Bunting, Passerina versicolor.
Judging from general appearance it is my supposition that this species
might be closely related to the Red-Crested Finch, Coryphospingus
cristatus and Pileated Finch, with the bill structure suggesting an
evolutionary linkage to the American Buntings. However, Frank
Chapman considered it a distinct separate genus, probably based on
the distinct shape of the bill which is longer, narrower, and more
pointed than the typical fringillid beak. It tends to be constricted
vertically and is perceptibly wider vertically than horizontally. This
is especially noticeable at the base (Frank M. Chapman, " A Contri-
bution to the Study of the Origin of Andean Bird-Life 55 Bulletin of the
American Museum of Natural History , 1926).
This species has been housed in a variety of exhibits here at the Zoo,
and it has been found to be an admirable aviary bird in all respects.
Four pairs were placed on an almost exclusive seed diet and they
remained in good health, although the red colour gradually faded to
a more yellow shade. Others were housed with sugarbirds and small
tanagers where a diet of fruit and very little seed was available, and
these also remained in good condition. Some were kept in a humid
environment, some in a desert habitat, and all did well.
I have found that by adding Super Caradee to a slightly sweetened
mixture of bread and evaporated milk, the males will keep their
brilliant plumage. I recommend that in addition to the basic finch
seed, the bread-and-milk mixture, some fruit and greens, and also some
insectivorous mixture be offered regularly, supplemented occasionally
with mealworms.
Unlike the Pileated and Red-Crested Finches, our Crimson Finches
have never been observed to be aggressive, either to any other species
of birds or to other males. Like Coryphospingus, they will dive from
cover in a dense brush when frightened, but the male normally prefers
to sit on an exposed perch where his bright colours are seen to good
advantage.
In the wild state this species lives in arid, hot environments, and in
captivity the birds should be provided with a warm dry area. This is
especially true when they are newly imported.
I hope that in the future more of these lovely little birds will grace
the aviaries of bird fanciers, as they are certainly a desirable addition
to any collection.

(Trichoglossus haematod capistratus )
By W. H. Brown (Tonbridge, Kent, England)
During the summer of 1964 I received two pairs of Edwards's
Lorikeets from a dealer in Singapore. These had been ordered as
Forsten's and I believe that a number of people over here were misled
in the same way.
However, they are very attractive birds and, unlike other members
of Trichoglossus haematod , they are easy to sex. The cocks have a decidedly
orange-yellow breast, whereas the hens have a lemon-yellow breast
with little or no orange showing at all.
The adult cock had had his wings pinioned and, of course, has never
been able to fly, but he at once paired off with one of the hens. They
are certainly very loyal birds towards each other and, at night when it
was time for them to be shut in, the hen and the other pair would fly
into the house at once, but the hen would come out again every time
and call to the cock while he clambered along the wire netting. As soon
as he was inside in she would go, but not before.
I separated the two pairs in the spring of 1965 and put in a nest-box
but, though several eggs were laid, they were clear and the nest-
box was taken out in October.
They wintered very well without heat and in the spring of 1966 I
put the nest-box in again. Several pairs of eggs were laid but they
were again clear. However, two more eggs were seen on 25th June, and
the hen seemed to be sitting reasonably tight.
I inspected the nest-box on Saturday, 16th July, and was delighted
to find a newly-hatched chick. The next day I found that the other
egg had hatched.
The young chicks grew very well but were very slow at feathering up
and leaving the nest. I was beginning to give up any hope of their ever
coming out when on 29th September, they both appeared, still not
fully feathered but very healthy. This was ten weeks after hatching.
They became independent after a couple of weeks and are now very
well-feathered and standing up to the cold weather with no trouble at
all. I think they are two cocks because of the orange-yellow breasts, but
this might be immature plumage. The only other difference from the
adults is the black beak instead of the orange one.
When the parents first arrived they were put into a birdhouse at
70* F., but the temperature was brought down quite quickly and they
were put into outside flights within two weeks. These flights are
12 feet by 6 ft. 3 in., with a small unheated house at one end into which
they are shut every night from November until early March.
They all drink nectar made up as follows : One teaspoon Horlicks,

one teaspoon Full Cream Nestles' Milk, and one teaspoon honey. This
is mixed with six ounces of water.
This particular pair and the youngsters also eat a good deal of
sunflower, peanuts, and apple.
As described, W. H. Brown has bred Edwards's Lorikeet ( Tricho -
glossus haematod capistratus) . It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

THE PEARLY CONURE
By Rosemary Low (Sidcup, Kent, England)
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.981096037037037" page_id="56378981"  page_num="4" year="" vol="">
The Pearly Conure belongs to the genus Pyrrhura. There are over
twenty species of Pyrrhura and these are most often represented in
confinement in this country by the Red-bellied (P. frontalis frontalis )
and by the White-eared (P. leucotis leucotis). Most of the members of
this geiaus have never been imported into Britain and the Pearly is very
seldom imported indeed.
For those who are unfamiliar with this genus of conure, I should
add that they resemble the Aratinga conures--those most frequently
imported--in no way whatsoever. The Aratingas have given conures a
bad name with some aviculturists for these birds are generally noisy
and destructive and they are seldom willing to breed in confinement.
The Pyrrhuras --although noisy when alarmed--have not the pene-
trating depth of voice of the Aratingas and I have never known them to
attack woodwork. They are not easy to breed but when a pair do
settle down to breeding they usually prove to be quite prolific. More-
over, the Pyrrhuras have great character and charm and are very active
and inquisitive birds.
My first pair of Pearly Conures was purchased in March, 1965.
I had never seen one before but vividly recalled the excellent plate in
Seth-Smith's Parrakeets which depicted this species. The illustration
does, however, fail to show the most attractive feature of the bird--the
scarlet area on the bend of the wing. Green is the predominant
colour--the wings, back, rump, and the lower part of the chest are
dark green. The bend of the wing and the under wing coverts are
bright red, the tail is dull maroon and the flights are deep blue. The
crown of the head is dark grey, the cheeks are light grey and the
throat feathers are grey, edged with a lighter grey and the chest

feathers are edged with blue, thus creating the scaled chest markings
which are typical of the Pyrrhuras. The nape of the neck, the tail
coverts, and the feathers surrounding the vent are blue. The legs,
beak, and eyes are black and there is a small area of bare skin surround-
ing the eye. Total length: gj inches.
The conures were placed in a small outdoor aviary with no shelter
but they slept in the nest-box at night. Pyrrhuras must always be
provided with a box for roosting. So great is the curiosity of this
species that a new nest-box will be explored and entered within seconds
of it being placed in the aviary ; more wary species may take several
weeks to enter a new box. If a bucket is left in the aviary during clean-
ing, it is immediately explored inside and out and anything edible is
quickly removed !
This trait of curiosity led to their escape on one occasion. I returned
from two weeks holiday to find the aviary empty. A rat had burrowed
up from under the floor, and the Pearlies, no doubt unable to resist
the temptation to explore, had made their exit via this hole. It was not
long, however, before I heard them calling in the distance and they
soon alighted in a large apple tree in the garden. I opened the bird-
room door and they returned almost at once. They are extremely
intelligent birds and I have no doubt that under the right conditions
they would do well at liberty.
The following November I was surprised to come across another
pair of these birds. They were undoubtedly a true pair ; one was far
bolder about the head and its upper mandible was wider. In size it
was appreciably larger. These characteristics (and the size of the feet
in the larger parrots) are the surest guide to sexing any parrot-like
species as the age of the bird and whether or not it is in breeding
condition are immaterial, unlike the pelvic bone test.
I very much wanted to breed Pearlies and as I had come to the
conclusion that my first " pair " were two of a kind, I was delighted
when the owner of the true pair agreed to sell them. I acquired the
birds in December and placed them in a small outside flight, 12 feet
in length, with an open-fronted shelter. The aviary was one of three ;
 |pairs of Pearlies occupied the outside flights and the centre flight
; contained, at that time, a pair of Red-bellied Conures. The new
Pearlies were not nearly as steady as my first pair, one of which is very
tame and will take food from the hand.
The staple diet of these birds consists of white sunflower seed, canary
seed, and apple. A millet spray is given once a week and seeding grasses
when they are in season. Hemp is supplied occasionally. I have no
doubt that they would accept any fruit that was offered. Neither
pair show any interest in loose millet although they are very fond of
spray millet. They bite off a section and fly on to a perch where they
eat it held in one foot, or, as often happens, one bird will hold the

millet and both will feed from it. Seeding grasses are eaten in the
same manner.
In January, 1966, I was lucky enough to obtain a hen in exchange
for one of my original cocks. This new pair, however, showed no
interest in breeding ; they appeared far too concerned with everything
going on around them. Large cockatiel type nest-boxes were immedi-
ately explored--then ignored. Pair number two chewed out the inside
of a hollow branch which I then had to remove as it would not have
made a suitable nest. In July they excavated a hole between the
ground and some boards which concealed a cavity between their
aviary and the next one, and disappeared inside. I blocked the hole
up, for if they nested there I should have been unable to inspect the
nest, should anything have gone wrong.
The conures were observed mating during the weekend of 23rd-24th
July. A week later the hen spent long periods inside the box, the
cock keeping guard on the nest-box perch. The nest-box, which was
situated on the feeding shelf at the back of the shelter, measured
12 inches high by inches wide and 9J inches deep. On 5th August
I took a look into the box when the hen was off the nest and found
three white eggs which seemed quite large for the size of the bird
and measured exactly one inch (25 cm). The cock took no share in
incubation.
On 27th August I heard the sounds of a youngster being fed, but
I did not look into the box until three weeks later. The hen's continuous
absence from the box caused me to fear that something was amiss,
although the amount of food taken was increasing all the time. Inspec-
tion revealed three plump and very healthy looking youngsters, almost
completely naked, and one very soiled egg which had probably been
clear or punctured.
While rearing, the adults were fed on sunflower, canary seed, and
a whole apple every day and at least two kinds of extras, either a millet
spray, seeding grasses, chickweed or grapes.
I inspected the youngsters at weekly intervals for the next three
weeks as the parents showed no concern whatsoever when I removed
the box from the shelf. The hen apparently only entered it to feed the
young or to roost at night with the cock. There appeared to be more
than two days difference in the ages of the two elder youngsters and
a slightly larger gap between the second and the third. At the last
inspection on the 8th October, the eldest youngster, which was almost
fully feathered, adopted the same threatening attitude employed by
the adults when disturbed in their box ; ruffling up the head feathers,
stretching the neck, and swaying from side to side. It was seen later that
day looking out of the nest-hole.
I did not inspect the nest the following weekend as the eldest
youngster, which was probably exactly seven weeks old, appeared to

be on the point of leaving and I did not want to cause it to do so
prematurely. On the 18th October, in the early morning, I watched
one youngster emerge from the box and fly on to the perch at the
opposite end of the aviary. A few minutes later the second youngster
emerged, flying equally well. They had obviously left the nest on the
previous day.
Both birds were very like the parents in colouring but the back of the
head is dark grey and only faintly scaled and the legs and beak are
lighter. They were about three-quarters of the size of the adults. The
bill of the eldest youngster was a dark grey while that of the second was
a light silvery grey, but it changed to dark grey within a few days.
I feared that the youngsters might get chilled if they roosted outside
in the torrential rain. They roosted in the box, however, following the
adults straight inside at roosting time. They fed themselves on apple
and hard seed almost immediately.
Five days after they left the box, which was the first occasion on
which I was able to watch them for any length of time, I witnessed an
interesting incident. The eldest youngster begged for food from the
cock, dropping its wings, then flapping them vigorously whilst being
fed. It then immediately disappeared into the nest-box and judging
from the sounds coming from within, it was feeding its nestmate !
This youngster left the box six days after the other two and was
noticeably smaller.
I have given a rather detailed account of this breeding because so
little has been written on the Pyrrhura conures, especially regarding
breeding. I should be very grateful if any members who have bred any
species of this genus or who have kept any other than the White-eared
or the Red-bellied, would let me have details of their experiences
with them.

In December, 1965, my friend Dr. K. Searle from Hong Kong
cabled me saying that there was a pair of Lorikeets on the way to me,
but the species was new to him. However, they turned out to be
Blue-headed Lorikeets from New Guinea ( Trichoglossus caeruleiceps).
These must not be confused with the Dark-throated Lorikeet
(Trichoglossus haematod nigrogularis ) from the islands of Aru.
On arrival the birds were treated in the normal way and were
gradually hardened off and put out in open flights the first week in May.
On 1st July, 1966, two chicks were hatched ; unfortunately only one
survived, as one died on the seventh day.
The hen laid again and on 15th November there were two further
chicks ; these at the time of writing have now feathered up and should
make their first appearance about 7th January, 1967.
It is, however, our intention to remove them from the nest on
about 1 st January as the weather is becoming extremely cold and
I think it would be safer to hand-feed them for the next week.
The parent birds are being fed on a basic mixture of honey, con-
densed milk, Farex, and glucose. Live food is given to them immedi-
ately the chicks are hatched ; apple is given daily.
It might be of interest to breeders to know that all our Lorikeets are
wintered out ; in fact it is a common occurence to see them bathing
in icy water.
As described by J. Rawlings, the Blue-headed Lorikeet Trichoglossus
caeruleiceps has been bred in the Kelling Park Aviaries. It is believed
that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

in 1965, the original female was penned with one of the younger males
and produced twelve eggs, seven of which were fertile and all chicks
were reared.
It was decided to split the clutch into two. Heat was given to the
chicks for the first seven days at a temperature of 75 degrees and was
reduced over a period of fourteen days to 50 degrees. Turkey crumbs
were available at all times to the chicks ; chopped yolk of hard-boiled

A COLLECTION OF WATERFOWL
By Rosemary Upton (Ingatestone, Essex, England)
I can look back over 10 years of enjoyment from my Waterfowl
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.992994125" page_id="56378988"  page_num="9" year="" vol="">
Collection, in fact they have been real fun. There are 40 species now,
and about 150 in number. They are all together on one piece of water,
which has ample surrounds of grass, trees, and bushes. I have chosen the
species with care, and have resisted keeping any which are known to
be foul-tempered and dangerous to others. I got one species that I soon
had to banish--two pairs of Canada Geese. When they started to nest,
and had young, they put the fear of God into all and sundry. They,
all eight of them, were taken by me to a reservoir, six miles away,
and were permanently pinioned or feather clipped. I felt much
relieved as I emptied out each Canada from a sack. It was goodbye,
or so I thought. Two years later two of the young birds which I had
dumped on the reservoir returned to nest. They fed at my feet, as
always, and as all my collection do. This pair of Canadas nested
about two yards from where they had been reared themselves. As they
were far from a good tempered couple, I took their eggs away and
thank goodness they made off, never to return.
All my ducks and geese are hand-tame, which makes it so easy to
pick up an ailing bird, and do something for it if possible. I really do
know all the birds as individuals and what fun that can be. I can recall
several amusing happenings amongst them.
For three years there has been an amusing matrimonial triangle.
A pair of devoted Mandarins are followed everywhere by a love-sick
male Cinnamon Teal. The latter can scarcely find time to eat. The
female Mandarin is entirely unimpressed. Most of the day the

Mandarins swim side by side or stand together and the Teal continu-
ally displays and makes noises at the female Mandarin. The latter's
husband is so obviously saying " Dear, don't look round, he is there
again "!
A female Chilean Teal was driven off her nest by a Mandarin, but
was quite determined to sit on some eggs somewhere. She found at the
end of a drainpipe nest, two deserted Shelduck eggs. She literally
had climbed up on these large eggs, and as the top of the nesting
chamber was movable, I often looked to see if the Teal was still sitting.
The eggs were far from well covered, I thought. Later on, when I was
walking by this drainpipe, I stopped, as I heard noises coming from the
tunnel. Almost at once out ran Mrs. Teal followed by two baby
Shelduck. She was obviously overwhelmed at her large offspring, and
most certainly her spouse was, he must have wondered who his wife
had got off with !
In 1964 I kept amongst my collection a female American Wigeon,
full-winged. This duck flew away in October, 1964, where to I do not
know, probably to a reservoir six miles away. During the first two
weeks of April, 1965, I saw fly on to the pond, a male European Wigeon
with a female. The latter almost at once flew to my feet and fed, it was
an American Wigeon, and by her behaviour I recognized her as the
one who flew away in 1964. The pair settled down and a clutch of
eggs was laid just outside the enclosure, under a hedge. I took these
and hatched them under a bantam. The young birds were pinioned,
and disposed of to someone who is interested in hybrids. About June
the European Wigeon male flew away, but the female stayed here.
During the first two weeks in April, 1966, the female American Wigeon
was missing from the pond, but returned later with a European
Wigeon male. I cannot say for certain that it was the same male, but
I had every reason to think so. There was a nest again, but inside the
wire enclosure, so I left the duck to sit, and she hatched seven young.
Again in June the male was missing, and still is in November. The
female guarded her ducklings until August when they could fly. The
latter are tame and feed from my hand, like their mother always has
done. I wonder what will become of these hybrids? No doubt they will
give headaches to bird-watchers, especially if it is the male birds that
they see. The females are so like European Wigeon, they no doubt will
be identified as such.
During the severe winter of 1962-63 I lost none of my Waterfowl,
but my bathroom had to be given over to five near-casualties. The
two first arrivals were a pair of White-faced Tree Duck. After a night
of 32 degrees of frost, they were both covered in ice, and the only
remedy I could think of was a hot bath.
All my ducks and geese, being so tame, their unusual surroundings

bathe and then tried to perch on the edge of the bath, but of course
slipped off. A folded bath towel was the answer and the ducks whistled
their approval.
The next very weak duck that had to be brought in was an old
female Chiloe Wigeon. The Tree Duck greeted their friend with many
whistles, and she was soon in and out of the bath, and then on to the
floor to eat out of a bowl.
Next, I found a female Cinnamon Teal in the shape of a lump of
ice, she too joined the bathroom party. Her recovery was miraculous.
The husband I felt sorry for, as they were a very devoted pair, so I
went and caught him. The reunion of the pair was so delightful to
watch, that it was well worth the extra messes that would now have
to be cleared up ! The female Teal showed her spouse the way to
get into the grand swimming pool, from the floor. First a jump
up on to one log, another little jump on a still higher log, one more
hop up on to the edge of the bath, then plop into the water. I was not
tempted to bring in the Chiloe Wigeon's husband, as he seemed very
happy playing fast and loose with other people's wives.
The ducks had clean bath water every other day. This had to be
a well-organized ritual. I made the duck get on to the floor, and they
soon learnt what was required of them. I then pushed into the bath
the towel and rinsed it out, cleaned the bath, and ran in fresh water.
When full, the duck were allowed to get in--and what a splashing
went on. They all five were obviously delighted with the clean water.
When the arctic weather had gone, the ducks were returned to the
pond, and I must say we missed the duck far more than we had missed
our bath !

Branta canadensis lencopareia
By Carl E. Strutz (Jamestown, N. Dak. U.S.A.)
The birds were taken from their winter quarters about ist April and
placed in a breeding pen of their own which contained a good growth
of grass and fresh running water. They immediately became acclima-
tized to this new pen and their actions became much like other Canada-
type geese when mated and preparing a nest.
The female began to bag down about ioth May and this made me
feel very good for I was almost sure she would produce eggs. I did not
notice them mate but they became real aggressive toward other geese in
bordering pens . . . even though they were almost completely alone
because of growing shrubbery along the partition fences. When I went
into the pen to feed them the gander would viciously attack me, much
like other Canada geese. This surprised me because in normal times
they are very amiable birds and rather shy and tame.
The female laid her first egg on 19th May and refused a nest-box
I had made for her. Instead she made a depression in a clump of
Reed's Canary grass in the corner of the pen just above the small pond
in their pen.
The egg is about the exact size of a Cackler Canada goose egg . . .
possibly just a bit larger if closely compared. The colour of the egg is
about the same as all Canada goose eggs . . . Richardson and Cackler.
After the first egg was laid they both became very aggressive and
guarded the nest viciously . . . the female, however, was not nearly as
demonstrative as the gander. She would stand near by, honking
continuously . . . but the little gander would fly at me.
An egg was laid every other day until five were laid and on 27th
May she began incubating. She was a very faithful bird and left the
nest very few times as far as I observed. The little gander stood close by
and really protected the female and nest. He was a little terror when
she was incubating. After 26 days, on the morning of the 22nd June,
I noticed the first little gosling stick its head out from under her wing.
That afternoon I saw two others, a total of three. I did not disturb
her, but the next day she was off the nest with four little goslings.
I examined the fifth egg and it had a little gosling in it, but she had
trampled it and the gosling in the egg was " mashed " and quite
emaciated.
Their rate of growth is much like the cackler and the old ones
raised and guarded the young faithfully. The little gander would
remain with the female and the young birds when I fed them . . . and
discontinued his violent attacks on me.

By H. E. Hitchin (Skenfrith, Monmouthshire, England)
Some years ago I lived in a house near an old mill which had closed
down, and had no difficulty in finding supplies of mealworms in the
offal that still lay in odd places in the mill. These were always in good
condition. When I came to purchase supplies in this past season I had
difficulty in recognizing them as the same species, so thin and under-
nourished were they on arrival.
Consequently, when I had to turn to maggots when mealworms
recently became unobtainable I decided to carry out a series of
experiments on feeding them from the time of their arrival until they
were all consumed by the birds--in my case a period of a fortnight
or so. I approached the problem from this premise--that if the maggots
were not fed at all during the intervening period then they must live
on their own fat until turning into a chrysalis. I therefore tried them
with foods, and found that maggots up to a certain age do actually
continue to feed if food is made available. Evidence of this could be seen
when coloured food, such as grated carrot, was incorporated in the
mixture, the colour being visible in the gut of the larva. As a result of
this feeding the maggots remained well nourished right until the last one
was consumed, their bodies appearing fat and white, turning into a
yellowish butter-milk colour just before they turned into a chrysalis.
I found the following feeding method to be most convenient in my
case. On arrival the maggots were turned into a cylindrical drum
made of three-ply wood, and given a good handful of crushed oats. They
were then left for 24 hours to clean themselves. The following day
they were fed a basic mixture of:
one part prepared breakfast porridge, cold.
one part Farex mixed with milk.
one freshly grated carrot.
The porridge was left over from breakfast ; and the Farex, a
blended cereal product sold as baby food, was that which remained in
the receptacles of softbills to which it had been given the previous day.
The ingredients were mixed together with a little milk into a thin
paste. About a teaspoonful of the mixture was fed daily on a small
square of cellophane placed in the bottom of the drum clear of the
crushed oats. Later in the day, when the maggots had found the food,
the cellophane was turned over and the maggots soon congregated
underneath. After a few days it was found that it was mostly the
younger ones that were taking the food, the older ones keeping to the
crushed oats which needed replenishing at the end of the first week.
At the end of the fortnight the drum was thoroughly scoured and
dried in the sun before restocking.

The following additives have all been successfully tried--honey ;
malt extract ; and a liver-rich dog food. These were worked into the
porridge before mixing. Other possibilities may suggest themselves.
The procedure is strongly recommended to those feeding live food to all
softbills.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
I heard of Mr. Hitchin's experiments through a mutual friend at
a time when I was pondering the problem of the lack of chlorophyll in
the diet of birds which normally eat green caterpillars, but to which
I could only offer maggots. Although many insectivorous birds will
also eat greenfood this does not always seem to be the case. It occurred
to me that feeding might offer a solution. What I needed was a fairly
liquid solution of green vegetable that could be easily obtained.
I suddenly remembered the strained, creamed spinach sold in tins as
a food for small babies. I purchased a tin and mixed equal quantities
of spinach mush and Farex. My maggots I purchase in small quantities
and keep in small boxes, and I put a quantity of the mixture in.
For several days I had a rather nasty oozing mess of mixture and
maggots, but when I had removed them and allowed them to clean
themselves again I found that they were now a yellowish green colour
internally and had obviously ingested some of the mixture. The
technique requires refining but it has obvious possibilities for anybody
who is faced with this problem.

A CRITIC AT THE SHOW

I have an uneasy suspicion that even those who agree with the
sort of things I write about the " National Show of Cage Birds " may
have no great wish to read them yet again in our Magazine. My
excuse is that our fair editor asked me. How could I refuse ? It may
seem unchivalrous to put the blame on a lady but there is precedent for
such behaviour as those who read the Bible as well as the Avicultural
Magazine will know.
My first impression, which may be wrong, was that the show had
shrunk. At any rate it was all on the ground floor, which made things
more convenient to the visitor. Most of the birds shown were, as usual,
in very good condition. I went, however, on the first evening and I
doubt if all of them looked as well by the third day. I was particularly
struck with the quiet beauty of a magnificent Silverbird (Empidornis

semipartatus ), a species I have never before seen alive and a most
beautiful one. This aberrant African flycatcher is bluish silver-grey
above and a light, but rich, orange-rufous on the underparts ; slender
in build with a longish tail. A Rock Thrush of a species new to me in
life (Monticola rufiventris) was also both beautiful and instructive, being
much less like other Rock Thrushes than I should have thought from
comparison of skins or descriptions. Among the British birds I was
charmed by a pair of Tree Pipits whose tameness allowed a full
appreciation of their subtle colours, grace of movement, and perfect
condition.
At least a majority of the foreign birds and British " softbills " were
as usual shown in cages that would not strike the lay visitor as
atrociously small and their frequent decoration, even if sometimes
incongruous to anyone knowing the native habitat of the species (I
saw a Diamond Dove's cage decked out with lush green moss suggestive
of a tropical forest), does give a good impression to the visitor. Things
were, again as usual, otherwise with the British " hardbills Nothing
could give a much worse impression to the average layman than the
tiny, dark-green painted cages in which the finches and buntings are
incarcerated. Only temporarily / know but many visitors don&apos;t ! What
makes this have as bad an effect as it possibly can is that it is just such
species as Chaffinches, Goldfinches, Bullfinches, and Yellow Buntings
that the average visitor is pretty sure to recognize, or at any rate regard,
as " wild birds
The dealers' stands were, with one possible exception, much better
than a few years ago. At any rate I saw very few obviously ill or injured
birds. All the same I felt, as before, when contemplating the dealers'
stands, serious qualms about the ethics of bird keeping. Looking at the
crowds of parrots of various species, obviously recently caught in the
wild, it was hard to believe, much as one would have liked to, that all of
them would be bought by competent and kind-hearted aviculturists.
All too many I fear, at their present prices, will end their days miserably
mewed up in " parrot-cages ". Looking at the cages full of various
waxbills (Yes, I know that, under the conditions the dealer must of
necessity keep them, it is wisest and kindest to crowd many of these
species to ensure adequate warmth and lessen the likelihood of serious
fighting) I doubted whether even an average bird keeper, like myself,
would have been able to keep alive 50 per cent of any dozen bought at
random. Indeed though my own bird room is chronically over-full, the
Tempter kept whispering in my ear " Well these are worse off, are'nt
they ? " Only the fact that with so many dozens in each cage it would
be almost impossible for anyone catching some up not to catch the
weakest first, and the virtual impossibility of finding good homes for
surplus waxbills made me restrain myself from adding yet more
Blueheads and some other new species, to my collection.

M. F. COUPE-NEWS FROM CHESTER ZOO
I stopped to look at a Budgerigar that had won a first prize. It was
of a rather nebulous grey colour, at least as to its underparts, its upper-
parts had the natural colour pattern, but in dark grey and oflf-white.
It was not, however, its relatively unattractive colouring that repelled
me, but its large size, disproportionately large head, and even more
disproportionately large facial spots. I thought of the graceful, active
wild Budgies that I had seen in Australia, whose normally-sized cheek
spots so beautifully set off their yellow faces. The real horror of 44 the
Fancy " is not that it should deliberately prefer and strive to breed such
monsters but that it should succeed in 44 brain-washing 55 the 44 man in
the street " into accepting its perverse values. We have heard much in
recent years about the service bird-keepers might be able to do, and
in a very few instances have done, in the way of preserving rare species
by breeding them in captivity. As things are, however, it is likely that
as soon as any species, rare or common, becomes sufficiently domesti-
cated for numerous people to be able to own it 44 the Fancy " decides
its natural size and shape can and should be improved (= distorted)
with the result that the birds subsequently bred are, to those who
appreciate natural beauty, mere travesties of the original.
Bird shows in general and the National Show in particular are the
most potent factor in perpetuating and spreading the belief that only
birds that conform to the fancier's ideal are of value and worth breeding
and that a naturally sized and shaped bird is worthless and should not
be bred from. For this reason above all others I was pleased by my
impression that the show had shrunk this year, hope that it was not
a wrong impression and look forward to the time when it will no
longer be.

1966 has been most successful with regard to bird breeding and ;
at least 20 species have been reared. Scarlet Tanagers were hatched
and reared in the Tropical House and it is obvious that several other j
species must have raised young. However, these have not been
recorded as, due to the rapid growth of vegetation in this building, it has
become increasingly difficult to find nests and too keep a check on
individual species.
The most notable hatchings were of two Sclater's Crested Curassows,
which have been fully described in Vol. 72, No. 6, of the Avicultural
Magazine. In Vol. 72, No. 5, page 127, of the Avicultural Magazine

Many of the Avicultural Society Members who visit the Zoo are

Zoos are not the best places to breed parrakeets as the close proximity
of visitors will normally deter all but the most insensitive birds from
breeding. However, in our Bird House aviaries, which are now used
exclusively for parrakeets and similar species, these birds seem to settle
down very quickly. Each pair has a large outside flight and an

Among the birds received into the collection at Regent's Park
during October and November are representatives of one genus, three
species, and two subspecies not previously exhibited here. The new
genus is Chrysococcyx k. klaas, Klaas's Cuckoo, of which a pair has been
received. They are of particular avicultural interest, for they were
brought from Kenya three years ago by the late David Roberts and
they have been kept since then in the aviaries of the late Capt.
Quincey. This small cuckoo, like others of the genus, has always been
considered very difficult to keep and it is evident that these have been
cared for with great skill and kept under excellent conditions ever
since their capture more than three years ago.
Klaas's Cuckoo is brood parasitic on a wide variety of small birds
such as sunbirds, flycatchers, warblers, weavers, and others. Adults
have been observed feeding young of their own kind after they have
left the nest.

During 1966 T. S. Thomson reared 150 British birds, mostly
Greenfinches, including 33 rare-coloured. The pheasants also did
well : 12 Blue Eared were reared from one pair and 22 Elliot's from
three pairs. Numerous Amherst's and Swinhoe's were also reared.
A young pair of Monal had two clutches of infertile eggs.

40 years ago, it has been served by many efficient and selfless officers.
One such is Mrs. Velma McDaniels whose term of office as Secretary
has unfortunately been all too short--persistent ill-health having
forced her to resign.
Mrs. McDaniels successor is Don Huffman, already well acquainted
with the affairs of the Society as he has served as Membership Secretary

Charles Lucas has been elected President, Avicultural Society of
Australia, for the nineteenth successive year.
In a recent letter Lucas writes : " Our parrot breeding season is just
about completed. I bred two Crimson-wings, eight Princess of Wales's,
four Barraband's, eight Scarlets, six Elegants, and plenty of Bourkes,
as well as a few other odds and ends. Bourkes have been breeding here
in Melbourne so well over the past two or three years that it is becoming
difficult to dispose of one's surplus, even at give-away prices of about
#2 io^. per pair. I have about 30 in my aviaries at the present time."

Mrs. Dorothy Speed, Fresno, California, has successfully bred the
Slender-billed Cockatoo Kakatoe tenuirostris : one young one left the
nest-box on 27th May. It was taken from its parents on 6th August and
shortly after was reported to be " doing fine, eating good and getting
fat and healthy ".
This is probably only the second occasion this cockatoo has been
bred in the United States. The first was at the San Diego Zoological
Gardens, where one young one was hatched on 23rd February, 1959.
There is a breeding account by Kenton Lint and a photograph of the
young one aged 104 days in the Magazine, 1959, 107.

Roseate X Slender-billed regularly for many years, in fact no less than
36 young ones were reared. Campbell writes : " The Galah was
mercilessly plucked by the Corella. At all times his only feathers
were those covering his head, wings and tail. His body was completely
nude and he was indeed a very queer looking spectacle. He died about
a month ago.
With strangers the Corella is most vicious but, as is often the case,
her owner can do anything to her without protest. His method of
removing her from the aviary is to grab her by the neck and lift her
on to his shoulder ; treatment which she really seems to enjoy, and
shows great affection towards him. When out of her cage it is not safe
for strangers to be within 6 feet of her as she will attack without warning.
Her age is about 50 years."

" The readers, and the printers . . . and writer of this book, belong
to a species of sophisticated ape, distinguished ... by a certain power
to store and communicate experience, . . . and both altruistic and
viciously aggressive behaviour." Thus, much abridged, the first
pungent paragraph of this stimulating, interesting, and informative
book by an author who, wisely, has not shrunk from letting his per-
sonality and opinions, perhaps even his prejudices, enliven his pages.
A mere list of chapter headings could give little hint of the richness
and variety here provided. The history of British birds, so far as
known or reasonably surmised, is given together with that of the land
they live or lived in and the people who caught, ate, named, or studied
them. A chapter is devoted to birds in literature, music, and art. One
to bird gardening : that is the encouraging of birds, especially but
(I was glad to see) not exclusively small passerine birds. Here, although
the author subscribes to the conventional idea that a bird table or

elevated feeding tray is desirable he does recommend that food be put
on the ground for such species as Redwings, Fieldfares, and Dunnocks.
This advice should result in positive benefit to some of the more needy
birds if we get another hard winter. All too many writers on the
subject of bird feeding recommend putting all the food on a bird table.
To do this is to ensure that in really hard weather the garden's resident
Blackbird can, and will, easily prevent any starving Redwings,
Fieldfares, or Mistle Thrushes that turn up from getting any of the food.
Bird protection in all its aspects ; with the customary smile at the
legitimate shooters of ducks and geese and the obligatory scowl at the
wicked egg collector. A detailed guide of the bird geography of Britain
and Ireland with an indication of all major accessible Bird Reserves,
Wildfowl Refuges, Bird Observatories, Zoos, and Museums. A list
of notable bird-watchers down the ages. A list of all living and fossil
birds known to have occurred (assuming all fossils to be correctly
identified) in Britain are also included. The book is profusely and
diversely illustrated with both black and white and coloured illustra-
tions by numerous artists ancient and modern, among the latter,
Robert Gillmor, Peter Scott, and E. A. R. Ennion. The last is repre-
sented by a whole series of delightful and slightly impressionistic
paintings which successfully and beautifully capture the spirit of their
subjects.
Those whose interest in birds is less wide-ranging than the author's
may feel at first disappointed that so much space has been devoted
to " other " aspects but it is to be hoped that the easy, lucid style may
win them over to widen their interests. Equally some may disagree with
the author here or there on this point or that ; if so they will at least
be stimulated to check or investigate the correctness or otherwise of their
own opinions. I do not think any bird-addicts are likely to get a more
interesting twenty-five bobs' worth than this book. If I were so
unfortunate as to lose my free review copy I should certainly go
straight out and buy another.

BREEDING ABILITY OF JAVA SPARROWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999479375" page_id="56379006"  page_num="23" year="" vol="">
In reply to the request for information on Java Sparrows, I am pleased to offer
the following.
In 1965 Mr. Childs, a member of Chester C.B.S., bred four Grey Javas from an
imported pair of Greys. I obtained the four young late in 1965. During the early
months of 1966, the four Javas " paired " up, both pairs going their own ways. They
were housed in an aviary 30 by 20 feet. During February and March one pair fre-
quently conducted a courtship act, which usually ended in mating. No nest-boxes or
provision for nests had been provided. The second pair kept together, sitting side by

side, but no display or mating took place. It was considered they were both cocks,
this being somewhat confirmed by subsequent observations, no attempt at nesting
being made.
The four Javas were transferred to a 70 by 70 feet aviary in April, having wintered
in unheated quarters. One pair made a nest in a horizontal type Budgie nest-box,
four eggs being laid. While all hatched, two young disappeared soon after hatching,
the surviving birds leaving the nest as healthy youngsters. The young were reared on
an all seed diet of canary and millet. The sexes of the two young are at present
unknown.
The same pair of Javas nested again, but Zebra Finches or some other of the aviary
inmates upset the procedure, the eggs being destroyed. Field mice may have been
the culprits as later in the season some nest-boxes were stuffed full of dried up rasp-
berries and loganberries, which are cultivated in the enclosure.
Next season a few wild-caught imported Javas will be added, in the hope that more
breeding takes place and possibly prevent further inbreeding, the present pair being
brother and sister. Furthermore, it is my intention to liberate the occupants of the
aviary, mostly Zebras, and make observations on their " domestication ", having
conducted a similar experiment about ten years ago. The Javas will be included in
the liberty trials which will commence about a month after the majority of the aviary
inmates have commenced nesting.
A few years ago I visited an importer's premises and was able to make a personal
selection which included a " pair " of Bengalese. Both turned out to be hens. On
a subsequent visit to the dealer, I asked for two cock Bengalese, and he was most
surprised that the two previously purchased birds were both hens. He informed me
that the exporters sexed the Bengalese, only cock birds being exported.
In my initial selection I had selected two birds that did not " sing ", in the hope of
obtaining at least one hen. While this selection and exporting of only cocks may apply
to a domesticated species such as the Bengalese, it is difficult to visualize any similar
procedure being applied to a wild-caught species such as the Java Sparrow.

Herbert Murray's success with this species (1966, 131) is certainly not a first success.
The Pileated Song Sparrow or Chingolo was bred by W. Teschemaker, in Devon, in
1907 ; two young were reared for which the Society's Medal was awarded (1907, 26).
Writing in 1921, Dr. A. G. Butler says that one of the young birds, a cock, was still in
his possession in perfect health and condition.
Two young were reared at the London Zoo in 1917 and, I believe, again later :
and two by W. Shore Baily in 1921 {Bird Notes , 1920, 177 ; 1921, 177).
A more recent success is that of B. Bennett, Hazel Grove, Nr. Stockport, two young
reared in 1958 {Cage Birds , 6th Nov., 1958).

Mortality in parrots imported in overcrowded and insanitary
conditions used to be very high. They suffered from a contagious
disease, characterized by diarrhoea and wasting, and the sufferer
almost invariably died. Bacteriologists eventually diagnosed it as
psittacosis, parrot fever, and so, in 1897, a new word was added to
the language.
In 1929-30 there was an epidemic in human beings with these
symptoms, coupled with bronchial pneumonia. The daily press
sensationalized the outbreak when it was discovered that many of the
sufferers had been in contact with parrots. It was immediately
assumed, and as it transpired correctly, that the parrots were to a very
great extent responsible : psittacosis was indeed communicable to man.
The Ministry of Health, in its wisdom, on 20th May, 1930, put into
force the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930. This
Order imposed a general ban on the import of parrots of all species
from all countries. The " Culprits " were confined to birds coming
only from South America, but no species was exempt, not even the
Budgerigar.
The Order remained in force for twenty-one years. The Parrots
(Prohibition of Import) (Revocation) Regulations, 1951, published on
28th December, 1951, rescinded the previous Order. As from 8th
January, 1952, parrots were again allowed into the country without
licence. The Regulations were revoked because :--
</bodyText>
<figure confidence="0.839885666666667" page_id="56379008"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
(a) There was no significant recurrence of psittacosis which led to
the ban ;
( b ) Research had shown that psittacosis is not confined to parrots,
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.9748322" page_id="56379008"  page_num="25" year="" vol="">
but occurs also in birds of widely different groups, such as
sea-gulls, pigeons, ducks, and turkeys, and consequently this
virus disease is more properly ornithosis ;
(c) The development of antibiotics had, to a very great extent,
robbed the disease of its dangers.
But hardly had we become used to the idea of there no longer being
a ban when the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Animal Health
Division) decided to reimpose it. The Order, Parrots and Miscel-
laneous Birds (Prohibition of Importation) Order, 1953, came into
force on 16th February, 1953. The Regulations were aimed at safe-
guarding the country's poultry flocks against the introduction of
Fowl-pest (Fowl-plague and Newcastle disease) from abroad. And
that ban remained in force for over thirteen years, only being lifted as
from 1st November, 1966. The reason given by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food being " long experience has shown

that, in practice Psittacines are not a significant factor in the introduc-
tion or spread of disease in this country The virus has been
diagnosed in a very large number of different species of wild birds,
many of which appear to harbour the virus without showing any
ill-effects.
Before 1930 parrots were imported in very large numbers. It will
suffice to give just two examples. Some of the older members of the
Avicultural Society may remember the advertisements of one very
prominent dealer--the business closed down at the beginning of the
war--" Parrot and cage, #1 ", and the rows of cages with their dejected
inmates, mainly Roseate Cockatoos and Indian Ringnecks, with an
occasional Blue-fronted Amazon for good measure, that hung outside
the premises. And the thousands of lovebirds--pairs each of Fischer's,
Masked, and Nyasa offered for #2 the lot. It is inconceivable that
imports will ever again be of such magnitude, or that birds will be
offered at comparable prices. But importations on quite an extensive
scale are to be expected. It is up to exporter and importer alike to do
everything possible to ensure that birds are packed and transported
under the best possible conditions. For remember, should this ban ever
be reimposed it is very unlikely that it would be on public health
grounds, but almost certainly on humanitarian. And if ever it is
reimposed it would almost certainly be permanent.

Things you should know about this food
As will be seen by the above composition of ingredients, this food is a COMPLETELY
NUTRITIONAL FOOD in every respect and practically impossible to be improved by
any addition. It has transpired in various talks our Principal has had with
Humming Bird fanciers, that many add honey, vitamin C syrup, abidec and similar
concentrates, with the mistaken idea they are improving the food. THIS IS NOT SO,
any such additive will unbalance the proven formula and is likely to do more harm than
possible good.
Whilst Stimulite Nectar Food was originally produced for Humming Birds and
Nectarines in general, it is such a complete nutritional food that its range of uses cover
the whole of the animal and bird kingdom. It has many advantages, sick animals who
will normally refuse solid or semi-solid food, will drink nectar with relish, mainly
because of its complete absence of fat-intolerance and its palatability. It will wholly
sustain and build to complete health animals or birds in its entirety, promoting in the
process, a healthy, free from disease, skin, fur or feather.
Most Humming Bird fanciers like to give a fresh or a change of food in the afternoon
or evening; this is a good practice and we have now developed a special ready to mix
food for this purpose, which we have used for many years on our own stocks.
This will be known as
Green Label Grade
and is guaranteed to contain the following ingredients in appropriate

On 13th February, 1967, Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Prestwich gave a
cocktail party at the Windsor Hotel, Lancaster Gate, to the Founder
Members of the British Aviculturists' Club, and members of the Council
of the Avicultural Society to celebrate the 21st Annniversary of
the Club.
As a mark of appreciation and thanks to Mr. Prestwich for his
untiring work and generosity over the last twenty-one years it was
decided to make him a presentation. This took the form of a design of
Red-faced Lovebirds, beautifully carried out by David Reid-Henry,
and a silver and gilt model of a peacock trailing its train. As a gesture
to the great part played by Mrs. Prestwich in ensuring the success of
the Club she was presented with a floral arrangement of orchids.
The presentations were made by the President, Miss E. M. Knobel,
who spoke as follows :--*

I don't know how many of you know that this is a very special day,
because twenty-one years ago this Club was founded. I wonder how
many people here to-day were at that first meeting. We did not
start off in a very flourishing manner and I remember at the end of
the meeting Dr. Amsler coming up to me and saying, ' Well that
won't last long. I give it three months.'
But it has lasted, and why has it lasted ? How could it last ? It
lasted because of our good, kind, hard-working and generous
secretary, A. A. Prestwich. He ran the Club. He did everything.
He found the hotels who would take us. He arranged the dinners.
He got the people who would come and speak to us and show us
their lovely films. That was no easy task, and above all, he paid. Our
money was not always sufficient to meet all that was needed, so he
paid. He never told anybody, he never asked any of us to contribute
and a little more, he said nothing about it, he just paid and we
came. We loved coming. We met our friends. We laughed and
chatted and we enjoyed ourselves, and we owe him a very great
debt. So we have met here to-day to try and thank him and to
show our appreciation for all he has done. I, as your President, and
on your behalf am asking him to accept a tribute. It is a picture of

the Red-faced Lovebirds, painted by David Reid-Henry, which
were bred by A. A. for the first time in this country ten years ago.
We also think that A. A. must be feeling very proud so we are giving
him another object that is always proud--a silver Peacock.
A. A., it gives me very great pleasure to ask you to accept these
things with our love and deep appreciation for all the pleasures you
have given us.
In addition to the President and the Hon. Secretary the following
founder members of the Club were present--Miss P. Barclay-Smith,
Dr. E. Hindle, and Mr. Derrick England. The Vice-Presidents of the
Society were represented by Monsieur Jean Delacour who came over
specially from France to attend, the other Vice-Presidents, Sir Crawford
McCullagh, Mr. G. S. Mottershead, and Mr. Allen Silver were
unfortunately unable to attend but sent telegrams and messages of
good wishes.

By C. J. O. Harrison (Perivale, Middlesex, England)
In 1963 K. E. L. Simmons published in this journal a description of
some characters of behaviour which could be used to define and
separate the babblers, Timaliidae, from similar families with which
they had been grouped. Most of the information that he gave was
based on observations of birds in aviaries, and he emphasized the need
for further observations. The present notes, also based mainly on the
study of birds in aviaries, have been brought together as an addition to
the existing information.
Display
There is very little information on courtship display in the babblers.
Simmons (1963) described a display of the Pekin Robin, Leiothrix
lutea , and Painter (1965) gave notes on that of the Black-chinned
Yuhina, Tuhina nigrimentum. Apart from this the only well-documented
display is that of the Bearded Tit, Panurus biarmicus , now thought to
be one of the Parrotbills, Paradoxornithinae, a subfamily of the
babblers. The Bearded Tit fluffs out and raises its head feathers, and
raises and spreads the tail to show the under-tail coverts. In the male
both are conspicuously coloured, the head grey with black beards, and
the under-tail coverts black on an otherwise brown body. The female
also postures, however, and the young are said to pair while still in the
juvenile plumage, the male posturing before he has acquired his
conspicuous colours (Witherby et al., 1938 ; Koenig, 1951).
In March, 1962, a pair of Masked Jay-Thrushes, Garrulaxperspicillatus ,

were observed collecting nest-material in an aviary at the London Zoo.
These birds subsequently nested successfully in 1964 (Yealland, 1965).
Both birds were on the ground and tended to stand side by side or
move around with short abrupt hops holding a stem in the bill and
maintaining a special display posture, most marked in the suspected
male. The bird held the head well raised and all the head-feathers
were erected to give it a fluffy, big-headed appearance. At the same
time the body was held well above the ground, tilted forwards a little
so that the closed wings and tail were in a horizontal plane. The
feathers of the flanks, belly, and under-tail coverts were fluffed to
show a broad expanse of flank feathering, the legs appearing relatively
short owing to the fluffed feathering. The main colouring is dull brown
and the chestnut colouring of the under-tail coverts and posterior
edge of the flanks became suddenly conspicuous in this posture (Fig. 1).

The closed wings were raised slightly above the back and shivered,
and there may have been some subdued vocalization, although nothing
was audible at a distance of 4-5 yards. On a later occasion, after an
outburst of alarm calls from these birds, the supposed cock was joined
by the other bird and suddenly took up a very erect posture with all
head feathers fluffed, closely resembling the one described above.
In the summer of 1966, in the Snowdon Aviary, a bird of this species
was seen to join two others perched in a small tree, and immediately
to draw itself up very tall, with all head feathers fluffed, the bill
depressed a little towards the breast, the belly and flank feathers fluffed,
and tail lowered and half spread. This display resembled the previous
one in many details but the body was held in a vertical, rather than
a horizontal, plane.

30 C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME NOTES ON BABBLER BEHAVIOUR
At Chester Zoo in 1963, a White-breasted Jay-Thrush, Garrulax
albogularis, in a mixed aviary without other babblers, was seen to carry
a twig and approach a Mynah in a posture similar to the first one des-
cribed above, with the difference that the head feathers were sleeked
down. The latter was almost certainly due to the fact that the partner
was a rather unnatural one. Birds of this species at the London Zoo in
1962, were seen courtship feeding. The cock fed the hen when she
approached in a slightly crouching posture with feathers fluffed,
her wings being shivered slightly at the moment of feeding. Once the
cock gave her a tiny twig instead of food, and she carried it for a
moment or two before dropping it. Both birds toyed with nest-material.
Two of the pale-breasted form of the White-crested Jay-Thrush,
Garrulax leucolophus , were watched at the London Zoo in 1964. They
were perched together, one leaning forwards as the other preened its
nape. The preener then turned round and began to peck softly at the
under-tail coverts of the other bird, moving the bill towards the region
of the cloaca. It repeated this twice, but each time the other moved
slightly. Shortly after both moved to the ground. One took up a posture
like that described above for the Masked Jay-Thrush. It had the flank
feathers spread and fluffed in the same way to show the bright orange-
buff of the posterior flanks, conspicuous against the mainly white
underside of this form. The body was tilted forwards slightly so that
the tail was raised a little, and the under-tail coverts were more
conspicuous (Fig. 2). Both birds had the head feathers erected. The
active bird, the suspected cock, hopped around the other bird in a
slightly crouching posture, pecking or preening at the under-tail coverts
and possibly cloaca-pecking. The two birds were interrupted by a
Rice Grackle, Psomocolax oryzivora, which thrust itself between them,
bowed its head in the allopreening-soliciting posture, and simply stood
there. Both Jay-Thrushes froze into immobility, and after a momentary
tableau, which to the anthropomorphic eye, suggested nothing but
acute embarrassment at interruption at an inappropriate moment, the
birds parted and display behaviour ceased.

C. J. O. HARRISON-SOME NOTES ON BABBLER BEHAVIOUR 31
The tendency to direct all preening activity towards the under-tail
coverts was also observed in the Grey-headed Crow-Tits, Paradoxornis
gularis , in the London Zoo in August, 1966. When these clumped
together in pairs they frequently sat head-to-tail and one would lean
over and preen the under-tail coverts of the other. If the other objected
it would turn and seize the nearest leg of the preener just above the
tarsal joint in its heavy parrot-type bill, apparently by way of a warning.
The incidence of cloaca-pecking in these and Simmons's (1963)
observations suggests that this might be related to the stimulation of
the female to adopt a posture facilitating terrestrial copulation, such
as seems to occur in the Dunnock, Prunella modularis (Harrison, in press ).
Bathing
A Grey-headed Crow-Tit was watched bathing in a shallow pool in
an aviary at the London Zoo. It used the in-and-out method described
by Simmons (1963) as typical of the babblers.
Communal Rearing of Young
Many babbler species habitually remain in small flocks and are
sociable in most aspects of their behaviour. There does not, however,
appear to be much useful information concerning behaviour when
nesting occurs. Everitt (1961a) described breeding by a pair of Silver-
eared Mesias, Leiothrix argentatus, in a large aviary. Two other females
of the same species and a female Pekin Robin, a very similar species,
were also present. These were apparently tolerated by the pair, but
played no part in the nesting until the young emerged from the nest,
when all five fed and tended the young birds. When the Masked
Jay-Thrushes nested at the London Zoo (Yealland, 1965) they were in
the large wader aviary, where a pair of White-throated Jay-Thrushes
were also present. These showed interest after the young Masked
Jay-Thrush hatched, perching on or near the nest when the parents
were away, and later were seen feeding the single young one after it
had left the nest.
In contrast to these, several aviculturists who kept more than a pair
of Black-chinned Yuhinas found that when attempted nesting occurred
the breeding pair would fiercely attack others of the same species, and
it was necessary to remove them, while Everitt (1962 b) found that a
breeding pair killed another two of the same species and continually
attacked Yellow-naped Ixulus, Ixulus Jlavicollis.
In a paper by the Marquis Yamashina ( Compte rendu , IXme Congres
Ornith. Int ., Rouen, 1938, 453-6) on the breeding habits of Tuhina
brunneiceps in Formosa, he states that various nests were observed and
each was attended by more than a pair. Up to six birds were seen
building a nest, from the eggs it was deduced that four females had laid
in a single nest, six adults were seen incubating one nest at different
times, and up to eight adults of both sexes were found feeding young at

various nests. It would therefore appear that social nesting is a
character of the Yuhinas as well as other babblers, but that there maybe
specific or local variation in this habit.

Antiphonal Singing
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999624225" page_id="56379061"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Antiphonal singing occurs in a number of avian species in widely
differing families. In this type of singing a pair of birds alternately
utter notes or phrases with such perfect timing that the whole sounds
like the song of a single individual. The honking song of a pair of
Toucan Barbets, Semnornis ramphastinus , is the one with which avicul-
turists are likely to be most familiar. Among the babblers antiphonal
song has been recorded (Van Tyne and Berger, 1959) for the Red-
headed Jay-Thrush, Garrulax erythrocephalus , the Red-cheeked Scimitar
Babbler, Pomatorhinus erythrogenys, the Fluffy-backed Tit Babbler,
Macronus ptilosus , and the Yellow-breasted Tit Babbler, Macronus
gularis. In 1966 in Western Australia I observed a pair of Grey-crowned
Babblers, Pomatostomus temporalis , for a period prior to evening roosting
and heard them during the following morning in the vegetation along
a creek where they may have been nesting. They frequently indulged
in antiphonal calling, using short harsh phrases of differing pitch that
overlapped slightly. From a distance the slightly harsh rhythmic call
with its constantly fluctuating pitch suggested that of some game bird
rather than a pair of passerines. It was later found that back in 1901
A. J. Campbell had commented " Sometimes a bird (male probably)
makes a loud cat-like mew, repeated nine or ten times moderately fast,
while its mate perched on an adjacent limb or tree answers each call
with a whistle-like note. So precisely are the two kinds of notes repeated
alternately, that at a distance they seem really to be produced by one
bird Both species of Whipbird, Psophodes spp., of Australia, now
considered to be babblers, use antiphonal song between members of a
pair (Condon, 1966).
In the autumn of 1965 a group of White-crested Jay-Thrushes were
heard indulging in a bout of calling in an aviary. It was observed that
two were using different phrases which overlapped slightly in utterance
but alternated in a constant rhythm that suggested antiphonal singing.
The sexes of the birds was not known. This last record raises a point of
interest regarding antiphonal singing in the babblers. Most records of
antiphonal singing in other families appear to be correlated with the
fact that the birds live in pairs and may need to maintain contact with
the right individual in thick cover. Many babbler species, including
the White-crested and Grey-crowned Babblers, normally remain
together in small parties. It would be of interest to know how such song
is related to the needs of birds within small social groups such as these,
and which individuals use it. It is possible that such groups contain a
dominant pair and that it is these which use this type of call.

MOULT AND PLUMAGE IN CAPTIVE
SEED-EATING FOREIGN DOVES
By Professor Carl Naether (Encino, California)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975055" page_id="56379062"  page_num="33" year="" vol="">
It seems rather strange that even though I have kept seed-eating
foreign doves and pigeons for many years in Southern California,
I have not been aware of their moulting at any particular time during
the year. It seems that when I kept domesticated pigeons, there were at
least some feathers lying and flying about in their pens almost the year
round, testifying to repeated and often copious moulting. However, I
find no such evidence in the pens of my wild foreign doves. And yet,
as with all birds (and with some other animals which shed hair, skin,
or horns) their plumage becomes worn as a result of flying and fighting,
or simply with age.
It may of course be that the moult of captive wild doves is slowed
down, if not appreciably decreased, by the fact that they have an
abundance of suitable food before them every single day of the year,
enabling them to maintain maximum physical stamina. For even
though their feathers as such are lifeless, they require a healthy body to
be sound and to stay sound, and in many species colourful and lustrous.
Another important factor, in addition to ample food, particularly
potent in the Southern California climate, which undoubtedly affects
the time, extent, and quality of the moult of wild captive doves is the
almost daily sunshine which greatly attracts and benefits them.
To be sure, there are many kinds of moult, the life-span of both single
feathers as well as feather-groups varying decidedly. The down on
young squabs may last but one or more weeks before it is supplanted by
feathers, which in turn may serve a half year or a full year, or even two

years, as in the case of cranes. Thus we may speak of a juvenal moult,
a transitional moult, a complete moult. According to the time of year,
we may distinguish between a spring, summer, autumn, and winter
moult. This would suggest that the widely differing conditions of the
moult are admirably suited to the modes of living of the various species
affected. Under normal conditions, the moult proceeds during periods of
rest, following the breeding season, when demands on the bird's energy
supply, as made by mating, raising young, migrating, etc., are very light.
All birds moult at least once a year, many species twice, and a few
even three times. The main function of the moult is the renewal and
replacement of faded and frayed feathers. In most species of wild doves
and pigeons this " change of clothing " requires but a relatively short
time during the year. Some birds take years to complete the develop-
ment of their adult plumage : thus the Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise
may take seven years and the Baldheaded Eagle up to ten years !
The juvenal plumage of many species of seed-eating doves, both
ground and arboreal, is usually of a neutral colour, often in harmony
with the colour of its immediate surroundings, and to that extent
protective, not easily discovered by predators. Of the numerous kinds
of young doves which it has been my pleasure to raise during twenty-
odd years, none has exhibited a colourful plumage while in the nest.
Even after leaving it, distinct and rich colour patterns, such as the red
blotch on the breasts of Bleeding-heart Pigeons, are at first very faint,
almost invisible, requiring months for their full development. This
transitional plumage--between the down stage and the ensuing
plumage--is considered a separate and distinct plumage by some
scientists, despite the fact that it is never completely developed. Its
function is to furnish the dove with a plumage during a rather short
period while the bird is still growing, often serving as camouflage
during a more or less critical time when the young doves cannot as yet
fly or fly well. While many birds exhibit two separate adult plumages,
the breeding and the non-breeding, each worn for a given part of the
year, captive doves as I know them from experience have only a single
adult plumage. In this group we find species in which males and
females have identically coloured plumages, and others in which the
males' plumages are different, that is, in most instances, more colourful,
hence more readily identified. In cases of birds having two mature or
adult plumages, breeding and non-breeding, the sexes usually differ, the
colourful plumage belonging to the male of the species, but changing
during the non-breeding season to look rather drab like that of the
female. I do not know of any species of wild doves, the females of which
show a more colourful plumage than the males. The females of the
phalaropes are more colourful than the males, a fact being closely
related to a reversal of sexual display and parental behaviour, and
demonstrating the plasticity of plumage.

To come back to the matter of moult, this phenomenon is as sensitive
to selection as are plumage pattern and colour. Thus in wild pigeons
given to migrations, as some of them are, the moult may be postponed
until after the winter quarters, where food is usually plentiful, have
been reached. Since moulting consumes prodigious energy, it rarely
occurs during periods of migration or reproduction, but almost always
during periods when food is plentiful. However, among tropical species
of doves inhabiting regions where the different seasons of the year
are not sharply separated from one another, as is true of Southern
California, for example, a good deal of moulting may occur during the
nesting and breeding period. This is true of wild doves kept in local
aviaries, some of which will breed the whole year through, with no
noticeable let-up during the so-called rainy season or winter months.
In point of fact, a pair of Bartlett's Bleeding-hearts is at this very
writing (beginning of February) brooding a youngster, having laid the
solitary egg and hatched it during rather cold weather. In other words,
their moult does not appear to be correlated with the calendar year
at all. Most ornithologists assume that as a general rule the demands
made by the moult on the energy of the birds keep plumage changes to
a minimum. Access to food rich in fats, so certain experiments have
shown, seems to be conducive to a rapid, complete moult ; in some
species of birds, it has eliminated the summer moult into the non-
breeding plumage entirely.

By T. S. Thomson (Hoole, Chester, England)
The use of fosters to raise various species of birds usually implies that
an easy-to-breed species is employed to rear a difficult type. Fosters
are used when the breeding cycle is broken either by accident, or by
some failure on the part of the breeding stock. Bengalese are frequently
used to foster species of the finch family. Domestic pigeons have
incubated Californian Quail eggs. The bantam must be the most often
used foster. With some species of doves the use of fosters is a necessity
to perpetuate the strain of man-made freaks.
During the past few seasons, foster Greenfinches have been used,
mainly to propagate rare-coloured specimens of the species. With such
a free-breeder the reader might ask why this waste of aviary space, and
why go to all the trouble with keeping the records of transfers, which
are quite considerable, considering that most clutches are split and all
young must be close-ringed.
With forty pairs of fosters and as many breeding hens, during the
height of the season, up to eighty nests may require attention at any

one time. The " pedigree 55 breeding stock comprises carrier cocks
with up to five hens per cock, and single normal cocks paired to single
lutino and cinnamon hens.
When polygamous breeding is practised with a species such as the
Greenfinch which is normally monogamous, the use of fosters is a
necessity, otherwise the unmarried mothers will neglect their brood
when turning their attention to starting another round. With up to
five hens per cock carrier, very few infertile eggs were laid. The average
ratio was three hens per cock, the proportion being partly governed by
the size of the aviary and the cocks past performance. Where the
normal cock/lutino hen mating was practised, there was no advantage
in polygamous breeding, the hen being the dominant part of the
pairing, producing cock carriers.
The breeding stock is housed in aviaries ranging from 20 by 6 feet
to 30 by 20 feet. A battery of 12 by 3 feet compartments is employed to
test young cocks which may be carriers. While all cocks bred from
cinnamon and lutino hens are carriers, only a proportion of the cocks
bred from carriers are themselves carriers. The fosters are housed in
larger planted aviaries ranging up to 90 by 80 feet.
The availability of " unlimited " aviary accommodation is an
important factor when fosters are used on a large scale. There are,
however, possibilities where space is at a premium. For example, if a
Budgerigar fancier divided his study, using the poorer specimens as
fosters only and only breeding from the best birds, while less birds
would be produced, the all over standard would be higher.
When an organized use is made of fosters, the aviculturist can select
the most opportune period to transfer the eggs or young. Transfer can
be made at various stages, the first being when a clutch has just been
completed. Fosters which have just completed their clutch are selected
and the transfer made. The pedigree eggs are marked in case the foster
hen should have laid another egg. A felt tipped ink-marker pen is ideal
for the purpose. Due to the number of nests involved and the fact that
some nests are not discovered until incubation is under way, eggs are
frequently transferred when partly incubated. It is possible to match
partly developed pedigree eggs with those of fosters at the same stage
by holding the eggs up to the light. It may be considered that the
timing of the transfer of eggs would be governed by the availability of
fosters with eggs of the same age. However, it was found that young
can be successfully reared from eggs which hatched fully a week before
the fosters eggs were due and likewise young were reared from eggs
which hatched a week after the fosters eggs were due, the fosters eggs
having been treated to prevent hatching. A few casualties resulted
from this " mis-timed " transfer of eggs, the foster hens sitting too tight
on the " prematurely " hatched young.
Newly born cinnamon and lutino Greenfinches are easily identified

and are transferred to fosters at various ages, up to a week old. When
there is any doubt that the fosters may accept and feed the newly
transferred young, a normal chick may first be tried. Normal coloured
young outnumber the rare coloured when a normal cock is paired to a
coloured hen. While some of the young cocks from such a pairing may
be carriers, in many cases only the coloured young are transferred, the
normals being destroyed. Such drastic action is necessary to fully
employ the fosters on producing the maximum number of mutation
stock. Any young that may hatch from eggs laid by fosters are also
destroyed, usually when the pedigree young are transferred. The total
number of eggs and young disposed of, approaches 800 per season.
Such a statement may shock the reader, but the object of the exercise
is the production of mutations which number just over thirty per year.
Nevertheless over a hundred normal coloured Greenfinches are reared
per season. A few are carriers, some possible carriers, and the majority
normal cocks and hens. A number of the latter is liberated annually.
Losses from the going light trouble do occur, but in view of the small
percentage affected no antibiotics are used or other action is taken to
combat this trouble. Many rare coloured young die in the nest, some
possibly from exposure during wet weather, especially when only one
or two occupy a nest.
Experiments in allowing surplus Greenfinches liberty when nesting
in aviaries, have resulted in failure. A few individual successes have
been recorded when Blackbirds, Song Thrushes, Starlings, Great-Tits,
Bullfinches, Hedge Sparrows, and Redpolls were liberated when
nesting, the young being successfully reared.
Even with such drastic culling, and even though no young are
produced from foster stock, an average of 1J young per pair has been
produced during the past few seasons. This may well be below the
results from wildlings, but with the protection given to the adult stock
and the young, the rate of increase in the aviary stock must exceed that
of the wildlings.
Research on the breeding British birds under control conditions
has shown that restricting the number of nestlings, especially with hole
nesters such as Starlings and Tits, is most desirable. If fosters cannot
be used, only the desired number of eggs should be allowed to hatch,
but unless the breeder has no qualms over culling young, it is best to
reduce the number of young a few days after hatching. Abnormal
coloured young have a general weakness in sight, as well as stamina,
and such culling is necessary for success. Two young Greenfinches per
nest is normal practice, and frequently single young are reared. When
only one lutino or cinnamon occupies a nest, a normal nestling a few
days younger, is added, to be removed after the ringing stage, depending
on the climatic conditions and the situation of the nest. In the early
and late periods of the breeding season fosters with nests under cover

are favoured, otherwise nests in a natural setting situated in live
vegetation are most frequently in use. On occasion some foster nests
and eggs have to be destroyed without making any use of their services,
but normally there is a shortage.
It might be rightly considered that all this handling of eggs and young I
would have a detrimental effect on the breeding results. Very few
failures were attributed to this procedure. With a fairly large breeding
stock it is generally impossible to identify individuals and cater for their
various characteristics. No doubt the birds became familiar with the
frequent intrusions and the school-boy bird-nesting activities of their
keeper.
Experiments in rearing other species by fostering either eggs or
young under Greenfinches, have been carried out over the past years.
Siskins, Redpolls, Goldfinches, Linnets, and Bullfinches have all been
successfully reared. Usually Greenfinch fosters fail to feed the newly
hatched young. A greater degree of success was obtained when young
nearly a week old were inter-changed with young Greenfinches which
were removed from the nest, bar one.
Experiments on fostering various species other than Greenfinches,
have also been carried out. The rearing of Song Thrushes by Blackbirds
and vice versa has provided interesting results. Frequently one species
would reject the eggs of the other, even when the eggs were camouflaged
as when Thrushes eggs were coloured to resemble Blackbirds. Young
of both species have been reared by the other. On more than one
occasion young Blackbirds have fed second-round young which had
left the nest, but were unable to fend for themselves.
Last season three Pennant's Parrakeet eggs were placed under a
Blackbird. After a week the eggs proved fertile and contact was made
with a local fancier who had a suitable foster to complete the incuba-
tion. One Blackbird egg had been left and, on it hatching and the
fancier not coming forward, one of the Pennant's eggs was transferred
to a Fischer's Lovebird. Just prior to this transfer the Lovebird, which
had two eggs of its own, had been given an infertile parrakeet egg as a
test. This egg, much larger than the Fischer's, was embedded in the
nesting material. It was necessary, therefore, before transferring
the Pennant's egg, to consolidate the Fischer's nest, this being done by
the use of one's fist. Ultimately the Pennant's egg hatched under the
Lovebird which fed it for over a week. The Parrakeet was too large
for the Fischer's to cover, and lay beside its foster mother with its
head resting on her back. Just prior to the young Pennant's being
hand-reared, it wandered from the nest, the hole being level with the
nest, and fell on a concrete floor, receiving injuries which proved fatal.
A few seasons ago, two Dippers were hand-reared, after being
incubated by Starlings. One Dipper was liberated on the upper
reaches of the River Dee. It was close-ringed T5 B.B.B.A. The

Dipper's eggs were obtained when the nesting site was over-run by
dam builders. The use of Hedge-sparrows as fosters to rear the more
difficult small softbills provides scope for further research. If aviary-
bred stocks of a species were established, normal breeding could be
practised.
In some fields the aviculturist reaps a world wide harvest, doing little
if anything to replace the diminishing stocks of wild life. There is an
urgent need for a policy which would encourage the establishing of
strains of various species. While fosters may be employed, the ideal
must be to create conditions where a species reproduces itself.

A VISIT TO ITALY
By J. J. Yealland (London, England)
When Monsieur Delacour told us (in the Avicultural Magazine,
!965, pp. 187-9) *f his visit to some of the collections of birds to be seen
in northern Italy, he concluded by saying that his account might
encourage others to see them. One had, of course, previously known of
Professor Ghigi's splendid collection and of his many achievements in
the field of breeding gallinaceous birds ; also something of the large
and varied collection of the brothers Callegari at Ravenna, but
naturally to read of such treasures is but a poor substitute for actually
seeing them and so it was with particular pleasure and anticipation that
I accepted an invitation from our member Dr. H. W. Clarke who
lives on the outskirts of Rome to visit him and to accompany him on
this grand avicultural tour. Accordingly, in late April, I went to Rome
and on the first afternoon we went to see Dr. Spinelli who lives near
Rome and who is well-known for his success in the breeding of a
Cheetah. He also keeps other large cats in addition to some other
mammals in his beautiful garden, but at present he has only one small
aviary of birds. The next day we set out early and our first visit was to
the estate of Marchese Fioravanti situated on the hills overlooking
Florence. This estate has long been a much-needed sanctuary for the
wild birds and it was not long before we saw a Hoopoe and a Pied
Flycatcher and we also heard Serins; Scops Owls are there in the
garden as well as many other birds. The Marchese has a large number
of birds, both wild and domesticated, in his pens and aviaries and
during 1965 he bred among others the Blood-breasted or Bleeding-
heart Pigeon. Late that afternoon we reached Bologna and called on
Conte Masetti Zannini whose large garden is some twenty feet or
more above the street that runs along one side. Here, as already
recounted by Monsieur Delacour, we saw the breeding Gang-gang
Cockatoos, Queen of Bavaria's Conures, breeding Demoiselle Cranes

and very many others. I was particularly interested to see Ara ambigua ,
the Great Green Macaw. In one aviary lived a flock of Quaker
Parrakeets with the characteristic large nest of twigs. Conte Masetti
opened a small door high up on the side of the aviary and the parrakeets
streamed out, shrieking as only Quaker Parrakeets can. It was al-
together more spectacular than any homing Budgerigar flock, but I
could not help wondering what kind of minor revolution would be
caused by such happenings in the centre of some English city. The
birds busied themselves in the trees collecting more twigs for the nest
and, no doubt, they all came back in due course. There were once
Quaker Parrakeets at liberty in Whipsnade Park and this was a great
success up to a point, but the birds, I understand, raided orchards all
around and so the experiment ended.
The next morning we called on Professor Ghigi whose large estate
outside the city must form another refuge for the wild birds. As
already recounted by Monsieur Delacour, Professor Ghigi's collection
of gallinaceous birds is one of the finest. I was particularly interested to
see hybrids between Ocellated and the common Turkey. Another
interesting hybrid was Hume's X Mikado Pheasant. The other rarities
already reported were still thriving and Dr. Clarke obtained excellent
coloured photographs of some of them, including the display of Grey
Peacock Pheasant. We also visited Dr. Busacchi in Bologna and among
the large stock of birds were some Ruffs of which I bought three pairs
for the Zoo's Waders' Aviary. Ravenna was our next stopping place
and here at the brothers Pietro and Eugenio Callegari's estate on the
outskirts of the city we saw such a collection that it would have taken
many hours to make any sort of census. The wonders seen and
recorded by Monsieur Delacour were still there and many more
besides, including the Acorn Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes formicivorus ) and
their young about which Dr. Eugenio Callegari has already written in
the Magazine. The large Dryocopus javensis, the White-bellied Black
Woodpecker, was another noteworthy species. The Great Crested
Grebes were still thriving, also the many waders including a Pacific
Golden Plover ( Charadrius dominicus fulvus) which was, if I remember
rightly, caught in Italy ; it is, of course, known to be occasionally in
Europe. The Nightjars, Dwarf Wood Hoopoes ( Rhinopomastus minor),
the Central American Trogon elegans, Wryneck, Goldcrest, and Firecrest
and a wealth of others, large and small, were there, but it was the Bee-
eaters, particularly the Carmine ( Merops nubicus) that were perhaps the
most memorable. They were then still in the winter quarters and were
in excellent health and plumage. The success in keeping these was
due to the diet which consisted of a great variety of insect life collected
during the summer and kept frozen until required. Like Monsieur
Delacour, I was also astonished to see a Great Anteater in a tree.
Another collection we visited was that of Dr. Amadei where there

was a nesting pair of Black Storks. The display of the male was very
interesting to see. Our next call was to the fine collection of Dr. Roberto
Bucci at Faenza. A large area of lake, woodland, and lawn provided
a splendid setting for the waterfowl, flamingos and others. Among the
parrots I especially remember a pair of Spix's Macaws and three
species of Pyrrhura that I had not seen before. The very good and well-
arranged collection that Dr. Bucci has set up in one of the town's public
parks was visited by us and here the " homing " Quaker Parrakeets
were again seen.
On our return to Rome we visited the zoo and were entertained by
Drs. Bronzini and Baschieri. The famous large stainless steel aviary
contained a variety of birds ranging in size from storks to the Pied
Crow. Some fine new aviaries were in the course of construction and
other large-scale improvements were being carried out. Three forms
of Crowned Pigeon [Gourd) and, of course, very many other rarities
were on view. Naturally I saw Dr. Clarke's own collection of wallabies
and other mammals as well as the birds among which was Crax
carunculata , Yarrell's Curassow, which he succeeded in breeding.
Without making constant notes it would be impossible to recall more
than a fraction of the avian wonders that we saw on that memorable
tour : what is, however, readily remembered is the hospitality and

I have many favourites at Chester Zoo but perhaps those housed in
the Temperate House attract me most of all. Here, in this attractive
setting, some of the real bird characters of the Zoo can be found. An
excellent photograph and description of this house has already been
given by M. F. Coupe in Vol. 71, No. 5, of this magazine. Since the
photograph was taken the foliage has grown well and the whole effect
has mellowed.
The birds in free flight certainly enjoy life to the full. The Touracos
and doves take a particular delight in swooping at great speed just
above the visitors' heads. A Fairy Bluebird hen spends her days flirting
outrageously with two beautiful cocks, one in free flight and the other
in an enclosure, while close by, a cock Great Indian Hornbill enjoys the
company of a newly acquired hen of the same species. At present they
are getting to know each other in separate enclosures. All the birds in
free flight appear quite unafraid of humans yet they also lead a very
natural life. From the numbers of young birds flying around, it is
obvious that good breeding results are obtained in spite of the large
numbers of visitors during the breeding season.

My strangest favourite in the Temperate House is Billy, the Boat-
billed Heron. I have watched his progress since his arrival and have
noted a great improvement in him. From a pathetic and timid bird
who had to be fed by hand in an effort to keep him alive, he is now so
confident and " at home " that it is surely a tribute to his keepers who
have shown such patience and understanding of him. Billy in turn is
completely devoted to them and as soon as he sees a familiar face, he
claps his beak in joyful greeting. His favourite food is herrings and I
am told that he will go on a hunger strike if a substitute fish is offered.
On one visit during winter I was dismayed not to see the Heron but an
inquiry to his keeper revealed Billy's secret hide-a-way. I was taken
to the heating unit which is situated behind the waterfall and there,
sitting all alone on a wooden bar in most un-heron-like surroundings,
was Billy, enjoying the extra warmth. In the wild these Herons live a
quiet secluded life in the mangrove swamps of Mexico and Brazil. They
are mainly nocturnal in their habits and have the large brown eyes
always associated with animals of the night. This of course explains
Billy's preference for solitude during the day.
In the enclosures on each side of the Temperate House live the birds
which for various reasons, are not suitable for free flight. Several Hill
Mynahs occupy one of them and all seem to have accomplished the art
of copying the human voice. One in particular will readily inform you
in a most refined voice that his name is " Charlie Charlie ". He
inquires about your health and has several other polite phrases to hand.
But his reply is far from polite if you teasingly call him " Fred ". In a
low, determined voice he tells you in no uncertain terms . . . what to do !
Across the way lives one of my oldest friends at Chester Zoo, a
Kookaburra fondly known by me as " Kookie ". He seems content to
live a solitary life and gazes in silence at his many admirers. Occasion-
ally the house echoes with his cheerful laugh which induces dozens of
other birds to join in. His diet includes two mice each morning, one
of which is always eaten straight away. The other is held firmly in his
beak sometimes for an hour or more. This unusual habit reminds me
of my son's baby days. When offered a box of sweets he would
inquiringly say " One now and one waiting for me ? " Kookie so
often has one waiting for him !

By Major J. M. Hay (Edinglassie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland)
In early March, 1966, I observed that one of my pairs of Pacific
Brent were mating. As so often with geese and ducks, the mere act of
mating does not necessarily mean that a nest and eggs will follow, so I
was not unduly hopeful. However, nearly three months later, on
24th May, I found a soft-shelled egg at the waterside which was
definitely the egg of a Brent Goose. As I keep two species of Brent, and
all the females looked as if they were about to lay at any moment, I
had no idea which female had laid the egg. Unfortunately at this stage
my only other female Pacific Brent died of a kidney infection. This
resulted in the two ganders fighting for the remaining female. I was
doubtful, if she laid, whether her eggs would be fertile. Fortunately
after a day or two the ganders stopped fighting and they swam and
wandered about as an apparently happy party of husband, wife, and
boyfriend. I could not catch up the odd male as this would have
meant disturbing the other breeding geese. There was also the
possibility of removing the wrong gander. The female was showing
great activity and wandering about all over the place. I began to hope.
On 30th May, six days after finding the soft-shelled egg, I found a
sound egg lying in an almost imperceptible depression in the ground a
few feet from the waterside. I thought that this was probably another
random laid egg. But just in case it was to be the start of a nest I
covered the egg lightly with some withered grass and left it there. I
never found the female anywhere near the egg and the ganders took no
interest in the site.
On the following dates, 31st May, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd June, no more
eggs were laid. I decided that I would remove the egg on the next day,
4th June, and try to incubate it. I went down to the pond on the
morning of 4th June to remove the egg. To my surprise I found the
female sitting. Now I had to decide whether to allow the female to
complete her clutch and hatch the eggs herself or to remove the eggs
and replace them with substitutes. I decided to remove them, as it was
too big a risk leaving them. The next problem was to catch the goose
off her nest. Despite repeated visits to her nest, I could never catch her
away from it. I think she must have been feeding and watering at night.
The two ganders were proudly guarding the female. On 10th June
I decided to disturb her and exchange her eggs for Mallard eggs. I
expected that she would have completed her clutch of eggs. I ap-
proached the nest slowly and was promptly attacked by the ganders,
however, I persisted and got my hand to within 12 inches of the female
before she left the nest. I quickly exchanged the eggs and retired. She

44 MAJOR J. M. HAY--BREEDING THE PACIFIC BRENT GOOSE
had laid a clutch of four eggs. I weighed and measured them and put
them under two broody bantams, two eggs each. The average size of
the eggs was : weight 3^ oz. The average measurements were : 75 by
47 mm. I went back to the pond and found that the female had settled
quite happily on the Mallard eggs.
On the fourteenth day of incubation I tested the eggs, only one
proved to be fertile. This egg chipped on the twenty-second day of
incubation and hatched on the twenty-third day. The incubation
period is stated to be twenty-five days. So this was about right. The
bantam sitting on only one egg, would probably hatch it a little earlier
than normal. After drying off, the gosling and bantam, were removed
to a coop and small run and put on the lawn. Food for the first week
was grated hard-boiled eggs, finely chopped lettuce, and chick mash.
This was fed five times a day. Like most other goslings, the young
Brent started eating and pulling at grass almost at once. Even at this
early age it showed the typical Brent posture and behaviour. The
second week grated egg was discontinued and feeding reduced to four
feeds daily, the size of the run was extended. The third week finely
chopped lettuce was discontinued and the gosling and bantam were
moved to a small field with short grass. During the following weeks the
chick mash was gradually reduced and replaced by biscuit meal and
small grained imported wheat, this eventually being fed twice a day
only. No access to swimming water was given until the gosling was
fully feathered.
The gosling is now over six months old and has proved to be a female.
So perhaps in two to three years 5 time another successful breeding may
take place. It would be interesting to know how often these birds have
been bred, and how many hand-reared birds exist. If some numbers
have been reared it should be possible by sale or exchange to arrange
for a nucleus of hand-reared unrelated birds tG be formed. I do not
think that the Pacific Brent has ever been bred in Scotland and I
would be most interested to hear from anyone who may have done so. ;
Note .--The Mallard eggs duly hatched, but the ducklings did not
live more than three days. Their main trouble was that they seemed
unable to distinguish their mother from the other Brent geese, and
consequently got chilled and died. I think that if they had been on a
pond by themselves the female Brent would have reared them.

A first period of nearly a half century of the history of the Park, at
Cleres, has just ended. Frank Fooks, its director for many years, died
on 27th January, 1967, after a long illness.
Born at Briantspuddle, Dorset, on 6th March, 1892, Fooks came to
Cleres in the spring of 1920, as I was settling down in the Chateau.
Seriously wounded in action in France during the First World War,
he had worked for some time at the livestock department at Derry and
Toms, in London. Before the war, he had kept and reared birds which
he loved as a boy.
At Cleres, Fooks at first attended to the animals and birds, and, after
a few years, he took charge of the whole property, which became the
unique object of his interest and devotion. It is because of his great
efficiency and reliability that I was able to leave every year on expedi-
tions to Indo-China and elsewhere, and to travel extensively. I knew
that he would take the most excellent care of everything during my
long absences. He was a master at keeping and rearing birds, and also
a perfect agent to run the estate.
Innumerable species of birds were successfully kept under his
supervision, ranging from Ostriches to Humming Birds. A number were
reared for the first time in captivity, among them the Crested Argus,
Imperial, Edwards's, Berlioz's and Lewis's Pheasants, Comb Ducks,
Australian Shelduck, Madagascar White-eye, Meller's Duck, Hooded
and Elliot's Pittas and Brazilian Water Tyrants. Ostriches, Rheas,
Manchurian, White-necked, Australian, Eastern Sarus, Stanley's
Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes were raised a number of times, as well
as large numbers of all sorts of Waterfowl, game-birds, Pigeons and
Doves, Parrakeets and various small birds.
Frank Fooks had to take refuge in England between 1940 and 1945,
but he returned to his beloved Cleres as soon as it became possible.
He promptly restored the ruined park to its former state, despite
tremendous difficulties. Conditions had changed since pre-war days,
and we now had to rely on visitors to stand the main part of the burden
of its upkeep. He proved to be a most capable manager, and he was
very successful in carrying on the work, practically single-handed as,
until i960 when I retired from the directorship of the Los Angeles
County Museums, I could not spend at Cleres more than a few weeks
each year.
His loss has been a terrible blow to me, after forty-seven years of
close association and friendship.

has come to succeed him, and I have taken measures so that the
Chateau and the Park will go, after me, to the Museum National
d'Histoire Naturelle and the Departement of the Seine Maritime.
It is the only hope to perpetuate what is perhaps the last of the larger
country homes adorned with an extensive collection of birds and park
animals, such as we knew a number in Europe before the war, which
have since vanished. I therefore trust that all the years of incessant
labour that Frank Fooks has devoted to Cleres will not have been in
vain. To me, it never can be the same without his presence.

By W. D. Cummings (Athens, Greece)
r \
I have just been reading through my copy of the Avicultural
Magazine and two articles--one by Jeffrey Trollope, Breeding the
Red-crested Finch, and the other by Philip Wayre on breeding the
Wheatear--raised a point which I meant to bring up in the Magazine
a long time ago. In other cases young were reared with leg deformities,
and the diet on which they were reared was mealworms and maggots.
In my experience of rearing Shamas, Western Blue-birds, Niltavas,
and other wholly insectivorous birds on a diet of mealworms and gentles
alone, I have found leg deformities, i.e. twisted feet and weak legs ;
vertigo (caused through thin skulls) occur in a good 70 per cent of the
broods. This points to a diet deficiency, partly lack of calcium, but
there is more in it than this. Grated cuttlefish bone sprinkled on the
live food helps in some cases but I believe there are other deficiences,
as yet unknown. It might help if one knew more of the diet on which
mealworms were reared, and possibly alter it accordingly.
I kept mealworms on puppy meal, on which they seem to do well
and is meant to be a balanced diet but with no obvious improvement
in the young birds fed on these.
I mentioned 70 per cent of the broods, because I have found the odd
pair of insectivorous birds that will rear perfect young year after year
on a rearing diet of gentles and mealworms alone, but this is definitely
the exception. I have also found that a pair will sometimes rear
perfect young the first time they breed and never again.
Most insectivorous birds will take nothing else but insects when
rearing young--otherwise the remedy would be simple. Small amounts
of mincemeat (raw) sometimes helps and they will feed it to their
young--but this is very apt to overstimulate the parents so that they

turn the young out of the nest. Other artificial foods like Bemax
sprinkled on the live food might be the answer, if regulated to avoid
this overstimulation.
The deficiency could be apparent in the parent bird after years in
captivity, so affecting the make-up of the embryo and the egg before
it is ever laid. To this end it is important to give wholly insectivorous
birds a nourishing insectivorous mixture and make them eat it over the
winter by tailing off the supply of live food, and adding wild berries,
especially elderberries which they will all eat, and which are nature's
winter tonic.
The complete answer I have not yet found, but it must be some
formula to be sprinkled over the mealworms and gentles, thus pro-
viding the parent birds with a complete diet on which to feed their
young. Gentles and mealworms they must have, for this is the most
easily procurable form of live food, and they need live food in order to
stimulate them into feeding their young. But my point is that these two
forms of live food are not, in the majority of cases, of sufficient nutri-
tional value to rear generations of healthy aviary-bred insectivorous
birds.
Other forms of live food, of course, is the solution, and wood-ant
pupae and eggs are one of the best forms of food, but most people have
not the time or facilities for collecting these. Hence I suggest some
synthetic food in powder form is the answer.
Thrushes, Tanagers, and other more omnivorous feeders will feed
their young on a far wider range of foods (including mincemeat and
bread and milk) after the first few days, and so one does not have the
same problems as with the more specialized feeders.

FEEDING FRUIT PIGEONS

Quite large importations of numerous varieties of fruit pigeons
during 1966 have prompted many an aviculturist to try his hand at
keeping and breeding them. This happens to be especially true of
California, where now a considerable number of individuals--the
zoos kept fruit pigeons for many years past--are in possession of one or
more pairs of these colourful birds.
With many of these persons, the feeding of fruit pigeons poses a
problem. Given only soft food in the form of various diced fruits,
perhaps mixed with some cooked rice, the droppings of fruit pigeons
are usually very soft and loose. If these birds are kept in relatively
limited space, frequent cleaning of their aviary becomes necessary, else
flies will be attracted, particularly in warm weather.

In an attempt to " firm " fruit pigeons' droppings, this writer mixed
small millet with the chopped fruit; later, large millet; still later, milo
corn--all of which would cling to the fruit and be swallowed readily
by the pigeons. However, he soon found that none of these seeds were
digested, being expelled whole in the droppings. He recently solved
this problem by mixing the diced pieces of fruit with chicken pellets,
so-called "all-purpose chicken pellets", containing 16 per cent
protein. Being thoroughly mixed with the moist fruit, the pellets are
slightly softened and are thus rendered more palatable to the pigeons,
which take them readily. While, naturally, they prefer the fruit,
picking it out first, they will then take also the chicken pellets. Thus,
the writer's fruit pigeons have been " cured ! " of loose droppings,
rendering their keeping, especially in relatively small space, much more
sanitary.

Everyone is familiar with the " walk through " or free-flight aviary
where usually a fine display of exotic plants take pride of place and a
small number of nectar feeding and other inoffensive species, as far as
the plants are concerned, are presented. Imagine such an exhibit, a
relatively small one measuring 20 by 22 yards where over fifty of the
larger species of softbills live quite amicably and future plans include
the addition of possibly as many again. True, the plant growth is not
dense and possibly never will be, but surely the impressive sight of
Hornbills, Toucans, Motmots, Touracos and Fruit Pigeons winging
their way overhead is worth the effort required to encourage plant
growth.
This then, is the showpiece of the superb new Tropical Bird House
completed in July, 1966, at Heysham just outside Morecambe, for the
Morecambe Corporation, who realized the need for such an educa-
tional and pleasing amenity within their borough. It is certainly the
largest and most modern building, devoted entirely to the exhibition of
birds, within the British Isles ; and the aim is to acquire over the next
few years an unsurpassed collection of softbills.
In design the building is modelled upon the successful Frankfurt
Zoo bird house which was constructed several years ago, and like it has
three halls, the Freeflight, Main Hall, and Jewel Hall. Many rare
species are exhibited in the Freeflight area, including the Tarictic
Hornbill, Buffon's Touraco, Yellow-breasted Fruit Pigeon, Greater
Rufous Motmot, and Long-crested Magpie Jay. The paucity of

terrestrial species is to be remedied as soon as possible with Asiatic
Lapwings and the larger species of waders.
Access to the Freeflight from the Main Hall is through a " bead-
curtain " only, which restrains all but the more confiding species which
frequently push through. There are glass-fronted compartments on
either side of the Main Hall, which project outwards at an angle into
the concourse. All contain community groups of compatible species.
One of the larger compartments houses a fine collection including the
Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock, Sun Bittern, Bristle-crowned Starling, Blue-
winged Pitta, Hoopoe and Blue-winged Mountain and Black-eared
Golden Tanagers. Whilst of the smaller compartments the one
containing Egyptian Plovers, Dwarf Bitterns, Superb Manakins,
Flycatchers and Redstarts is typical of the variety and number of the
birds exhibited throughout.
Included in the Main Hall compartments are several uncommonly
exhibited species--The Southern Treepie, Coleto Mynah, Whiskered
and Scarlet-browed Tanagers, Amethyst Brown Fruit Pigeons, Scaly
feathered Malcoha, Pygmy Flowerpecker, Dollarbirds, and the Grey-
hooded, Woodland and Pygmy Kingfishers. The collection of Barbets
is particularly impressive, there being pairs of Double-toothed, Black-
spotted, Red-headed, D'Arnauds, Black-throated and Red-fronted on
exhibit.
There is also a large waterbird exhibit in the Main Hall in which
Ibis, Egrets, Flamingoes, and Trumpeters can be seen. The Ibis and
Egrets are fully flying and frequently fly out over the 3-foot high
barrier, circling the public concourse before returning.
The Jewel Hall contains ten smaller glass-fronted compartments
designed primarily for the nectar feeders and smaller species of softbills.
They are illuminated with overhead spotlights which give a greater
jewel-like effect because the public area is in comparative darkness.
These compartments can be serviced through a small door in the rear,
or from the front, the whole of which hinges upwards. Fortunately the
majority of birds exhibited have quickly learned to go through the
small door into the safety-porch beyond, so that even regular daily
servicing can be done with comparative ease from the front. Species
housed in these compartments at present include the Van Hasselts,
Superb and Malachite Sunbirds and the Yellow-bellied, Isthmian and
Blue Sugarbirds.
Throughout the building full use has been made, as far as finances
would allow, of rocks, water, and plants. A different effect has been
created in each compartment by landscaping with various types of rock
and having pools of varying shape, depth, and size. In some cases
waterfalls have been created. It is intended to improve these as the
opportunity occurs and create more ecologically suitable environments
where possible. One definite task for the near future is to replace a

non-planted Psittacine exhibit with a bamboo and bullrush exhibit
suitable for Bittern, Bearded Reedling, Dabchick, etc. Softbilled birds
and plants are not always compatible however. Our experience is that
most members of the Rhamphastidae, Icteridae and Thraupidae, in
particular, are destructive to plants, whereas the smaller insectivorous
species, nectar feeders, and many species of pigeons, particularly
Fruit Pigeons, have never interfered with the vegetation. Naturally the
plants have been chosen for their toughness and resilience and have
been carefully placed to avoid favoured perching places on the dead
branches provided for this purpose.
Glass has been used extensively throughout the building as a means
of restraint and is certainly more in keeping with a modern building
than any type of wire mesh or tensioned wire. In addition to providing
an unrestricted view of the exhibits it has many other advantages ;
possibly the most important is that it allows both temperature and
humidity to be controlled, allowing variation of exhibits within a
building. Where it is intended to show the more exacting insect-
eating species, glass-fronted compartments are invaluable as the use of
live insects--blowflies, locusts and crickets, is then possible. There is the
risk of course that birds will injure themselves by flying into the glass,
but my experience, even if perhaps somewhat limited, has been that
the percentage of injury through this is very low if the necessary pre-
cautions are taken when the birds are introduced to their new habitat.
Heat is provided by a large oil-fired boiler equipped with the latest
in automatic controls. The temperature is maintained at approxi-
mately 70* F. with a slight reduction at night, whilst the automatic
dimming and lighting system allows a full twelve-hour day during the
winter months.
Mealworms are used infrequently and more blowflies than maggots,
which many of the smaller birds have trouble in digesting, are used in
the glass-fronted compartments. Most of the smaller species of softbills
seem able to catch blowflies, particularly when these have just emerged
and are less active. For those birds which have difficulty with blowfly
maggots, houseflies are bred and their larvae used when about half
grown, at which size they seem ideal for small Tanagers and Sugar-
birds, and are far less trouble to rear than wax moths or allied species.
Due to the greenhouse-like conditions necessary for plant growth to
thrive, the provision of carbohydrate and oil-rich foods is carefully
regulated.
In keeping with the modern trend the service area is spacious and
contains a large kitchen, storeroom, staff room, office and large
birdroom well equipped with flights and small cages, as it is considered
essential to have ample space behind the scenes for new arrivals and
those off-colour. In the adjoining insect room large numbers of locusts
are reared. Their rapid rate of reproduction and size range from soft-

By Drs. L. A. and G. Swaenepoel (Lembeek, Belgium)
Obviously most Parrakeet-breeders have become " worm-conscious "
in recent months, and in my opinion this is a happy state of affairs, as
only when one is aware of a problem can a solution be looked for.
Personally I cannot afford, from financial and sentimental reasons, just
to discard the harvest of corpses into the dustbin and think of more
pleasant things. I hope every breeder will take the same attitude, so
we may be able to preserve in our aviaries the more rare species, many
of which are still in a very precarious situation.
It is certain that in recent years parasites have become a real plague
in most establishments, if not in all. This seems due in part at least to
the Australian Parrot ban, with subsequent shortage of fresh blood and
the extensive exchanges of birds between different breeders. A few
infested birds are quite sufficient to disseminate the disease through
the different collections in a short time. Wild birds, especially Starlings,
may have given a helpful hand : I have no idea of the identity of the
Ascaridia transmitted by these pests. It is quite probable that the
Capillaria have been distributed largely by domestic pigeons and
poultry. To our knowledge we all have an ample provision of these
parasites in our collections, some more than others, but up till now we
have never had the opportunity of visiting a clear collection. As a
consolation, I can affirm that according to news from friends every-
where, not one single country has a monopoly of these pests, but there
is an even distribution all over Western Europe and even other
continents.
We have the impression, on examining what little statistics are
available, that mortality by worm-infestation is quite high and may be
estimated as at least 25 per cent of the total mortality in Parrot-like
birds, excluding Budgerigars. The first step to prevent further losses,
due to any kind of disease, is to have a post-mortem of each casualty.

This can be done, preferably in an official laboratory, but attention
should be called to the possible existence of parasites in the bowels, as
some laboratories are not used to examining Parrot-like birds.
Alternatively it can be done by a veterinary surgeon interested in
aviculture, or by the breeder himself, who will at least be capable of
noticing major alterations to vital organs and who will jump from his
chair when witnessing for the first time a heavy infestation by
Ascarids. Human nature is thus that one gets used even to this.
I have neither literary nor scientific pretensions and quite possibly
this article will contain errors in some part. I do hope that some
specialist in parasites will take the trouble to rectify where necessary.
Ascarids
The Ascaridiae are the most spectacular parasites, colonizing the
digestive tract of Parrakeets. They are round worms, commonly
called Roundworms, and may attain several inches in length, but
usually i to i |inches. I am still in doubt which species of Ascaridia we
find in our Parrakeets. Some label them as A. galli, others as A.
columbae ; a Belgian specialist affirms it is a specific kind only found
in Parrot-like birds. He hints that there are little or no outward
differences, but that experimental contamination with the non-
specific species is not possible. I would be very interested to obtain
data on this very important point, capital indeed in the prevention of
reinfestation.
Ascaridiae are sexually dimorphic : female worms are longer than
male and possess a fantastic egg-laying capacity, which makes it a far
easier proposition to breed worms than young Parrakeets. I have never
counted the eggs laid per day per worm, but it is estimated that an
adult female of a related species, the human Ascaris lumbricoides, lays up
to 200,000 eggs per day !
On evacuation in the faeces the worm-eggs complete their embryo-
nic development in about fourteen days to a month under favourable
circumstances of moisture and warmth. They possess an extraordinary
resistant shell, excellent protection against atmospheric, chemical, or
physical action. In fact most of the usual disinfectants are utterly useless
to destroy them. There is one weak point though in this carapace :
susceptibility to heat of some sort. It seems that the eggs are destroyed
at 40* C. after a short time. Direct sunshine, boiling water, or a
flame-gun are excellent to sterilize the soil and shelters.
The only chemical 1 I know to be of value is Hydrol which has to be
used in a 1/4 dilution in paraffin : a friend of mine flooded his aviaries I
with this mixture and as he is of the careful kind he gave up smoking.
He left the birds in the aviaries and noticed no accidents, though I
could not advocate this, the product being quite toxic, especially in an
enclosed room. At the same time he treated his birds and during two

years he did not detect one single parasitic egg in his birds. As a test he
dug up three aviaries last spring and within three months he again
found signs of infestation in two of these aviaries. This means that the
top layer of the soil was apparently sterilized, but that the eggs lower
down were still alive and well, thank you ! This also confirms the
extraordinary protective capacity of the outer cuticle of the eggs,
which may remain contagious for many years.
Now, whilst writing this article, I had a phone call from this friend
telling me he had done a check-up in all his aviaries a few days ago and
that about 50 per cent again were infested by Ascarids ! It is difficult
to explain everything, but it shows that the battle against these
parasites is not a simple matter !
To return to our birds : the ingested egg containing a larva is
broken open in the digestive tract and the larva digs itself into the
mucosa of the small intestine. The human Ascaris makes a peregrina-
tion through liver and lungs before returning to the small intestine, but
this does not seem to be the habit with Ascaridia.
Capillaria
Capillaria obsignata , which seems to be by far the most frequent
species found in poultry and parrot-like birds, is much less spectacular.
This roundworm is somewhat less than an inch long, but so thin that
it escapes detection by the naked eye. The egg-laying capacity of the
female approximates a very modest hundred per day. The eggs
develop somewhat quicker than those of Ascarids, but they have a
similar resistance to external agents. Again heat and the chemical
hinted at earlier are effective means of destruction.
These very small worms dig themselves into the bowel-wall and feed
on lymph or blood. Some specialists (for instance in our country) stress
the danger of Capillaria -infestation ; on the other hand in Great
Britain this parasite seems to be considered " more a nuisance than a
real danger

Pathogenic Action

<bodyText confidence="0.999100363636364" page_id="56379086"  page_num="53" year="" vol="">
A slight infestation of either kind of parasite is not bound to cause
much harm to the host. The trouble is to keep the numbers down and
prevent heavy infestation, when the inmates of an aviary can pick up
the eggs by the million on the soil. The same problem is not posed to
the birds in the wild where droppings are scattered over a wide area
and reinfection becomes a possibility, not a probability.
The principal danger of heavy Ascarid infection is obstruction of the
bowel by a clot of entangled worms. Not seldom one witnesses
peregrination of Ascarids in the bile-ducts, even in the intra-hepatic
canals, where they may cause obstruction or severe inflammation.
Intestinal perforation has been observed with ensuing peritonitis,

though it is considered improbable that an Ascarid can break through
a healthy bowel-wall. The droppings may seem normal, but are
mostly gluey, due to the presence of mucosity.
Though the enumerated mechanical causes are by far the most easy
to observe and probably the most dangerous to the host, there are more.
In all cases there exists a more or less pronounced alteration of the
intestinal mucosa, mostly hemorrhagic enteritis, brought about by the
irritation of this pathologic presence, which facilitates secondary
infection. Disturbances in the absorption of food and vital substances
is a logical corollary.
The worms, when numerous, help themselves to a considerable part
of the digested nutritients in the bowel and this necessitates a higher
intake of the bird to counterbalance. Vitamins and oligo-elements are
skimmed off by these pests and may cause deficiencies of the host,
already living on a diet rather poor in several vital elements.
It seems likely that the parasites secrete substances, which act as real
poisons and cause a variety of intoxications, especially in cases of
diminished resistance. Often nervous accidents of epileptic, meningeal,
convulsive, or paralytic type may be seen, caused by the toxins ex-
creted by the worms, though of course these symptoms may be brought
about by totally different causes in completely worm-free birds.

Diagnosis
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999257095238095" page_id="56379087"  page_num="54" year="" vol="">
The only efficient diagnostic possibility is the systematic search of the
faeces for eggs of the two kinds of worms mentioned. This is not a
complicated business though not easy to explain in an article. A
demonstration is much quicker and more convincing. An ordinary
microscope with a magnification of 60 to 150 is quite sufficient, ranging
in cost from maybe #5 to #200, according to the craftsmanship. The
lowest-priced apparatus are really toys, meant for studious children, but
they are quite sufficient for a small collection. Owing to the fatigue to
the eye, a higher-priced microscope should be recommended for a
large collection.
A small particle of faeces (the dark part, the white being the urine of
the bird) is spread out on a glass plate with a drop of water. Care
should be taken to avoid grit, which hinders the close adherence of a
small cover glass used to flatten out the field. This field has to be
searched systematically in even, regular strokes from one side to the
other. It is no good just to twist the glass around a bit : if very few
eggs are present, you may miss them. It might do to send the faeces of
each bird to the laboratory, but apart from the financial objections
there is loss of time between the taking of the sample and the response.
I always cage the birds up inside until I have been able to collect a
nice fresh dropping. Many breeders strongly object to the handling of

their birds, so they have to find a way of ascertaining that the dropping
comes from a particular bird.
Eggs of Ascaridia are ovoid and measure about 80 X 45 p,. They
present an outer cuticle, a thin black line and a broader white shell.
The inner part is blackish or dark grey and gives the impression of a
network. Due to the fantastic egg-laying capacity, a thousand and more
of these eggs can be found in 1 g. faeces.
The eggs of Capillaria are rather smaller and much more oblong.
They have a light-coloured outer shell and the inner is mostly greenish,
depending on the light used. A definite characteristic is the presence of
a blister-like " plug 5 5 at each pole, which makes them resemble an
elongated lemon.

General Conduct
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992392133333333" page_id="56379088"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
It is of the utmost importance, in view of the complication of the
matter, to carry out a plan of campaign and let the little grey cells do
some work ! It is of no avail to clear the birds without a thorough
disinfection of the aviaries. Even this is not sufficient as the lawn and
the paths in front of the aviaries are sown with eggs, carried about on
boots, blown by the wind, or washed in by the rains. It must be remem-
bered that the offal taken out of the aviaries is highly infected and that
this is no place to take a lovely bunch or chickweed. A regular check-
up should be made of the droppings of each bird in each aviary : it is
not sufficient to take two droppings in an aviary, they may belong to
the same bird and it has been noted that quite often one partner is
highly infected whilst the other, usually the female, is quite free. It is
certain that an individual, and variable susceptibility exists, perhaps
regulated to some extent by hormones.
Treatment of the Birds
Many different methods and drugs are used, but only those with
which we have some experience can be mentioned.
Some breeders put the drug into the drinking-water : but one has
no control on the intake with our parrakeets which drink little.
Others put the product into the beak with a fountain-pen-filler. The
best method, we find, is direct into the crop with the aid of a syringe
and catheter. It could also be done by injection into the crop through
the skin, a method commonly applied to pigeons. This will be tried
out one day.
Piperazine is probably the best known drug. Different combinations
and salts are available from several firms and give fairly good results.
Some of these may be more potent than others for all I know. The usual
dose is approximately 100 mg. piperazine per 100 g. (4 oz.) live
weight. This corresponds to the weight of a Rosella, Pennant's, Princess
of Wales, etc. Piperazine does not seem very toxic, so extreme accuracy

is not necessary. This drug has no action whatever on the larvae dug
into the intestinal mucosa, so the treatment should always be repeated
fourteen days to three weeks later, when these have become adult. A
microscopic control is also absolutely indicated as one single dose
gives no guarantee at all. It should be remembered that it is wise to
give small progressive doses over a length of time in case of heavy
infestation : one massive dose may kill off too many worms, which may
very well cause an obstruction of the bowel of the patient.
Pamoate of pyrvinium 2 has similar activity. Dose : 1 ml. per 100 g.
live weight.
R82gg, an imidothiazol, 3 exists in injectable form for the larger
domestic animals and in tablets for oral administration to poultry and
pigeons. We have always used the injectable presentation, as the other
is quite recent. This contains 100 mg. active substance per ml., which
we dilute 1/10 and this dilution contains 10 mg. per ml. The normal
dose is 40 mg. per kg. live weight or 4 mg. (=0-4 ml. of the dilution)
per 100 g., which corresponds to the weight of a Rosella. Toxicity is
rather low and I tried out increasing doses of up to 2-5 ml. (25 mg.
active substance) on a Budgerigar of about 50 g. The bird showed no ill
effects at all, even when given ten times the normal dose. Some birds,
however, show vomiting : this can be prevented to some extent by
treating the birds at evening when the crops are full.
We have found this drug to be extremely active on Ascaridia, both in
adult and larval form. In only two cases of approximately one hundred
birds treated, one single Ascarid remained, though the bulk was
evacuated. A second dose took care of this escapee. As a precautionary
measure, we always give the bird a second treatment even when the
microscopic control is negative.
Unhappily the destructive action on Capillaria is not comparable. If
it is possible or even likely to clear a slight infestation, there is never
certitude. In one case of very heavy Capillariosis of a hen Cockatiel,
five successive and increasing doses brought no apparent difference in
the number of eggs found in the faeces. A cock Green Rosella of 175 g.
received about 30 mg. (3 ml.) without apparent ill effect on the host,
or on its guests. His Ascarids, however, had been cleared at the first
small dose.
Methyridine 4 exists also in injectable and oral forms. We started by
using the first, but have now fallen back to the second as more easy to
handle. This is an excellent product for treating Capillariosis.
Unhappily it is only slightly active towards Ascarids. The use of this
substance is not without danger as I experienced some time ago. The
toxic dose is about 250 mg. per kg. live weight. One should keep well
below this.
We now use the oral form in a dilution of 1/50 (i.e. 1 ml. oral product
to 49 distilled water). This dilution contains approximately 10 mg.

DRS. L. A. AND G. SWAENEPOEL-OF BIRDS AND WORMS 57
methyridine per ml., which I consider a dose sufficient for a bird of
Rosella-size. Results are very encouraging concerning Capillaria.
Even the extremely infested hen Gockatiel was very nearly cleared
after one single dose and was completely free after a second identical
treatment. All the other infested birds treated, perhaps a score, were
cleared apparently in one single treatment. I say apparently, because
the comparatively low egg-laying ratio commands an extensive and
repeated search for the eggs before one can declare a bird free of these
pests. One Ascarid (female of course !) cannot be missed, but a
thousand Capillaria cannot equal the egg-laying output of this cham-
pion ! When only a few Capillaria are present, it is not impossible
that no eggs are detected in one single preparation. Examinations
should always be repeated.
Technique
I touched a word on the different techniques of administering a drug
to a bird. My friend, D. Young, convinced me to use a syringe with
catheter, much superior to the fountainpen-filler I was used to.
Indeed this method is much easier, quicker, and less dangerous to the
bird.
I use a plastic syringe of 2 ml. with a medium-sized metal needle
attached. The tip of this needle is filed off, a plastic catheter (the plastic
coating of an ordinary electric wire after removing the inner cable is
ideal for this purpose) is firmly pushed around the needle and extends
beyond the tip. The length of this catheter should be 3 inches. The
bird is held in the left hand in the classical way, thumb and index
at the base of the head. The catheter is introduced sideways at the
commissure of the beak, pushed behind the tongue, and held in the
direction of the throat. It is absolutely unnecessary to continue
pushing and it may be harmful : far better to let the bird swallow the
catheter which weighs lightly downwards. The catheter should be
introduced about 2 inches for Neophemas, Bourke's, and Red-rumps,
about 3 inches for Rosellas, Princesses, Parrots, etc. Once the end of
the crop attained, the catheter will not proceed further and the light
weight of the syringe will not cause any harm. The injection can be
made steadily then, and with gentle movement the catheter is with-
drawn. It is wise to try your hand on a small bird of the gentle
species, such as Bourke's, Neophemas, or Red-rump. In cases of doubt a
veterinary surgeon will be of great help.
After the worm-treatment, we always advocate a dose of a multi-
vitamin preparation ; it is easier though to give proper indications to
fellow breeders than to apply them yourself and I must humbly confess
that often this last part was not executed in our aviaries. All these little
jobs, trivial by themselves, total up to quite a business and time is
limited !

I do hope that correct treatment of our aviary inmates will in time
put a stop to the sometimes heavy losses that occur in many collections.
If the loss of a Rosella is not an irrepararable catastrophe, it may be a
very severe setback for a small breeder and anyway the loss of a few
Blue Bonnets or Hooded is a catastrophe even in very extensive
collections.

In view of the increasing concern regarding the numbers of birds
which have been found dead or dying on arrival at London Airport,
the British Section, International Council for Bird Preservation decided
to convene an informal conference of bird preservation societies,
aviculturists, representatives of airlines, the pet trade, and other
interested bodies to discuss the whole problem of the conditions of
transport and importation of live birds.
The Conference was held on Tuesday, 17th January, 1967, in the
Meeting Room of the Zoological Society of London, under the
Chairmanship of the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Cranbrook. The meeting
opened at 10.30 a.m. and continued in the afternoon after a break for
lunch which was arranged in the Fellows Restaurant. It was attended
by over sixty participants including observers from the Board of Trade,
Home Office, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Ministry of
Health, and Nature Conservancy. Four major airlines, B.O.A.C.,
B.E.A., B.U.A., and K.L.M. were represented including the Chairman
of the I.A.T.A. Study Group on the transport of animals. The
Directors of Bristol and Chester Zoos and of Birdland and the Tropical 1
Bird Gardens, Rode, were present together with representatives of the
Avicultural Society, National Council for Aviculture, Foreign Bird
League, the Pet Trade Association, Livestock Importers Advisory
Committee, and many other organizations.
No formal papers were presented but a series of statements on various
aspects of the problem were given and the main business devoted to

There was a full discussion on all points and in summing up the
Chairman pointed out that there are three stages in the travels of a
bird from the point of capture to the Zoo, private individual or pet shop
in this country. The first is from the forest to the point of departure and
there, although no figures are available, the death rate is believed to be
high. In 1966 over 400,000 birds passed through the R.S.P.C.A. hostel
at Heathrow, 200,000 coming into this country (about half the total
number entering at London airport) and about 230,000 in transit.
From the figures supplied by the R.S.P.C.A., it was shown that the
average death rate amongst these birds during the journey was between
ij and 2 per cent. There is a further fairly heavy mortality in this
country before the bird settles down, which must be attributed very
largely to the shock and strain of transport. There are no accurate
figures for this subsequent mortality, but it is estimated at a further
2 to 10 per cent. These figures are an improvement on those of twenty
years ago, and this is doubtless due very largely to better containers
and efforts by the airlines to ameliorate the conditions of travel.
In 1959 the British Standards Institution produced specifications of
containers for the transport of birds and other animals and the Con-
ference was satisfied that if these were universally adopted a great
improvement should result. The Conference heard with great satisfac-
tion that the International Air Transport Association Study Group was
working on the whole problem of the transport of live animals by air.
A full report of the Conference will be issued.

A number of interesting species have arrived since our last report
was published in September-October. Our Waterfowl collection has
been enlarged by the following birds :--
i African Black Duck, 3/4 European Eiders, 2/3 European
Golden-eyes, 0/1 Abyssinian Blue-winged Geese, 0/1 Australian
Shelduck, 4 Australian Shovelers, 0/3 Pintails, 1/1 Argentine Red
Shovelers, 4 Australian Rajah Shelducks, 1 /1 Australian Shovelers.
During the last months of 1966, five Black Swans and three Black-
necked Swans hatched, but because of the bad weather conditions only
one of the latter was reared successfully. We bought, from a dealer,
nine Andean Flamingos ( Phoenicoparrus andinus) which we keep together
with our James' Flamingos ( Ph. jamesi ). As in all collections, also in
the Berlin Zoo, both these species are kept separated from the other
Flamingo species because they require a special food. In the Penguin
enclosure, a Jackass Penguin hatched, and the Humboldt Penguins laid
their first egg. In both species we have had very good breeding results
during recent years. This is probably due to the fact that the keeper
hand-rears the young ones for a certain time when their parents begin
to stop feeding them. This operation is done with a plastic syringe
filled with fish pulp.
From Australia we imported 0/1 King Parrot ( Alisterus scapularis)
because our old female had died when her young was just a few weeks
old. As the father did not take care of him, it was reared by hand.
Also from Australia came two pairs of Crimson Rosellas ( Platycercus [
elegans ) and a pair of Eastern Rosellas (P. eximius ).
New in our collection are two Spectacled Owls ( Pulsatrixperspicillata ),
which we got as a gift from the Fort Worth Zoo, Texas. We are very
happy to have received this beautiful species which we had tried to
obtain for many years. The birds are still young but they are now
beginning to change their youth plumage. Also new are four Burrowing
Owls ( Speotyto cunicularia) . Among the most valuable new-comers are
three fine specimens of Great Blue Touracos ( Corythacola cristata ) and
two Bald Crows ( Picathartes gymnocephala) , companions for our single
bird.

A large collection of Birds of Paradise have arrived at the Zoo since
my last article for the Avtcultural Magazine. These birds were
accompanied on their long journey by Mr. D. Bush and arrived in
excellent condition. The following species arrived : The Carol Six-
plumed, Count Raggiana's or Red-plumed, Lawes' Six-plumed,
Magnificent, Prince Rudolph's or Blue, Sickle-billed, and Superb. It
is now our proud boast that we have one of the largest collections of
Birds of Paradise outside New Guinea. These birds, in common with
our original Birds of Paradise, are housed in thickly planted aviaries
in the Tropical House.
The pair of Red-billed Toucans and a Laminated Hill Toucan
which were housed in aviaries, have been released in the Tropical
House. In such a large area, they show no signs of attacking any of the
other sixty species of birds at liberty. Several nesting barrels have been
provided for the Red-bills and they seem to be showing an interest in
these. The cock Orange Cock-of-the-Rock (.Rupicola rupicola :) and a hen
Scarlet Cock-of-the-Rock (.Rupicola peruviana sanguinolenta ) have also
been released in the Tropical House and have settled down very well.
The two young Sclater's Crested Curassows have been transferred to
an aviary away from their parents, who remain at liberty in the Tem-
perate Bird House. The adult birds are showing signs of going to nest
again and have attacked the young ones.
The Black Swans have one egg at the time of writing (22nd February)
and we are hopeful of a continuation of mild weather.
Apart from the Birds of Paradise there have not been a great
number of new arrivals in the Bird Section. We have received a pair of
young Emus, several Maned Geese, and a pair of Occipital Blue Pies.

The annual census of the Zoological Society of London, taken on
31st December, 1966, showed that the oldest inhabitant of the London
Zoo was an Australian Pelican, acquired in May, 1922. Friday,
13th January, was indeed unfortunate for " Percy " as on that date he
was found dead, natural causes. The oldest inhabitant is now a
Sulphur-crested Cockatoo " Cocky " who arrived in 1925.

Mrs. D. A. Speed, Fresno, California, has bred the Thick-billed
Parrot. She writes : " My baby Thick-billed Parrakeets are out of the
nest, perching and beautiful. They have white bills the same as when
they came out of the nest; just starting to darken a little on the lower
mandible. Can't understand how the ones at San Diego Zoo have
black bills." (Avic. Bull., Dec., 1966, p. 2).

Walther Langberg, Copenhagen, reports, 1966 : " Last year the
Australian parrakeets did quite well. I bred ten Crimson-winged, six
Princess of Wales's, five Pileated (Red-capped), four Rock Pebblers.
Bourke's, Turquoisines, Elegants, and Splendids all did well, but
Blue-wings only had one young one. The blue Indian Ring-necks had
clear eggs. The finches also bred well, with young from Royal and
Peale's Parrot-Finches, Bicheno's, Star, Chestnut-breasted, and
Painted.
At the moment (late December) I have on the perch three young
Spectacled Parrotlets ( Forpus conspicillatus )."

There are a unique series of photographs by Frederick Kent Truslow,
to illustrate " When Disaster Struck a Woodpecker's Home ", in
National Geographic ", December, 1966.
Truslow was photographing the nesting of a pair of Pileated
Woodpeckers in Everglades National Park, when the dead pine

containing the nest suddently broke off at the nesting hole, despite a
complete absence of wind. Later Truslow found that the woodpeckers
had so hollowed out the 8J inch trunk that the walls of the nest
measured only a quarter to three-quarters of an inch thick. The female
carried off the three eggs to an unknown destination--possibly to a
roosting-hole. The whole operation took just sixteen minutes from the
time the tree broke.

Henry Bates, who with co-author Robert Busenbark, has produced
standard American books such as Parrots and Related Birds and Finches
and Soft-billed Birds , writes : "We are very busy with quite a number
of humming birds. Most are from Ecuador, but we do have two
specimens of our native Anna's Humming Bird. One we hand-reared
with an eye-dropper. It matured into a charming little hen. The

into an attractive male."
For the information of those interested in such matters Anna was
the wife of a Duke of Rivoli, son of the French Marshal Massena. The
Duke himself had a humming bird named for him--Rivoli's Humming
Bird (.Eugenes fulgens).

I have always thought that the name Avocet was singularly appropri-
ate for this lovely wader. It is apparently derived from the Italian
Avosetta or Avocetta, probably literally " a graceful or delicate bird ".
The Avocet was believed lost to the British scene until quite suddenly
newly-hatched chicks were observed in Essex, in 1944. Since then an
increasing number of pairs have nested in Britain and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds has now announced that last year
about 145 young were reared--of these 125 were reared on Havergate
Island, Suffolk. This remarkable revival is in the main due to the
conservation programme of the R.S.P.B. It is indeed fitting that the
Avocet is the official emblem of the Society.

There are now no less than seventy zoological and bird gardens
open to the public in Great Britain. The time had surely come for
the formation of a society devoted to their interests. The Federation
of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland has now come
into being. Members will be required to maintain the standards laid
down by the Federation ; these include the care, housing and trans-
portation of animals, hygiene and public safety. In the interests of
conservation members will be asked to consult the Federation before
acquiring rare animals. The present membership consists of the
following Founder Members :--

As a " Tail Piece " to these notes in the January-February, 1966,
number of the Magazine I recorded the fact that a doctor in America
was offering 4 d. each for one hundred English sparrows to be made into
a " Fayette sparrow pot pie ". Whether he succeeded in obtaining them
I know not, but I do know that the landlady of an inn in Essex recently
baked a hundred sparrows in a pie for the regular customers--the
event was given wide coverage in the daily press. I strongly disapprove
but it must be remembered that many countryfolk in our forefathers'
day baked such things--they were unable to afford butcher's meat.
And people do still bake pigeon pie and to a lesser extent rook pie. It
is to be sincerely hoped that no one tries to emulate the old nursery
rhyme and bakes four-and-twenty Blackbirds.
Small bird life would seem ever to have been regarded as of little
value. In the market places of Galilee, sparrows--the name covered
the innumerable species of little dead birds--were offered at two for a
penny, or five for twopence. In living memory the bounty paid by the
so-called " sparrow clubs " was a mere halfpenny.
Sometimes nowadays one has cause to marvel at the little regard
shown by some juvenile courts. A recent case was that of two boys,
aged twelve and thirteen, who shot four Blue Tits in a neighbour's
garden. They were fined 5.y. each !

Such is the shortage of the larger Australian parrakeets that almost
any enthusiast in England would be only too happy to have a pair of
Kings or Crimson-wings in his aviaries. But in the " Land of Parrots "
the position as regards numbers is very different.
In Australian Aviculture , January, 1967, Ronald A. Thomas gives an
account of a lightning tour he made of some of the aviaries in
Queensland. Amongst others, visits were made to Mr. and Mrs.
Brosland, with sixteen King Parrots all in one aviary, and a dozen
Crimson-winged Parrots ; and Bill Hooton, sixteen King Parrots, the
adult pair and thirteen cocks and one hen. A visit to Mr. Sutton,
Longreach, revealed " In the first aviary he had thirty Kings, sixteen
Crimson-wings, two pairs of Galahs, and ten Pennant's Parrots. In the
second aviary there were Red-wings, Kings, and Buln Bulns. In No. 3
aviary there were Western Australian Stanley Rosellas, various Doves,
and Rainbow Lorikeets. In No. 4 aviary there was a flock of forty
White Javas which made a very striking display. In No. 5 aviary there
were Gouldians with young, Red- and Black-headed and, in
Mr. Sutton's words, " Copper (dilute reds) rubbish bred from his
reds." In aviary No. 6 there were forty Corellas and last but not
least a Wedge-tailed Eagle. The size of the aviaries is not given but
they must have presented quite a sight.
Ronald Thomas says that " those who keep Kings and Crimson-
wings find them to be free breeders and long livers. The consensus of

opinion is that if you keep one pair only in an aviary there is little hope
of breeding but with three or more pairs they breed very easily ".
It is to be very greatly regretted that there is not the remotest
possibility of putting the second part of this theory to the test in
England.

Owen Long, Salisbury, Rhodesia, writes : " Birdwise this has not
been a very good year, definitely not a vintage year. The pheasants
did pretty well, especially the Golds, but as most people seem to have
suffered a similar fate, perhaps it was not just me. Because of these
sanctions, some of the usually available food-stuffs were not available,
and I personally believe that this was the main cause. The owls did
not come up with anything at all. Most eggs were infertile, and the
Eagle-Owl ate all her eggs, just as they were on the point of hatching,
due, I believe, to an overdose of disturbance from dogs and things.
However, next year will be better. It couldn't be worse, I'm sure.
Last year, I had about a hundred Guinea Fowl eggs, whereas so far this
year I've had one !
You may be interested to know that five days ago, here in Salisbury,
a Zoological Society was formed. We have a committee of eleven,
seven of whom are professional zoologists or veterinary surgeons, yours
truly as Hon. Sec., and a former warden of Wankie Game Park as
President. One of our aims is to establish a Zoological Garden, as and
when funds become available. I hope to have something to do with the
birds, and one of my aims will be to try to get some of the birds on the
Red List established here. I firmly believe that the conditions which
we enjoy here would be most beneficial to most of the endangered
species, and with a little luck on our part, and a good deal of co-
operation from the birds, the bane of Wilson's life could become one of
the major factors in saving some of these animals. For example, no
one, to the best of my knowledge has ever tried to breed the Tadjoura
Francolin, nor the Swierstra's Francolin, and where would be a better
place to start than here in Central Africa. However, these things are in
the future, but so long as they are not forgotten, we might yet be able
to do our bit."

Is Trichoglossus caeruleiceps correct ? Peters says that it appears to be a synonym of
nigrogularis. It would be interesting to know how it differs from nigrogularis, and if it is
distinctly different, it would be considered yet another race of haematod wouldn't it ?
Whether nigrogularis or not, it would seem to be a first breeding.

Trichoglossus caeruleiceps is a race of Trichoglossus haematod. Cain (Ibis, vol. 97 (1955)?
447) recognized this race as being smaller than the very similar T. h. nigrogularis, with
slightly heavier barring on the underside and slightly more purplish-black on the
belly. Cain recognized twenty-two races of this species, resulting from its island
distribution, and many are only slightly differentiated from each other.

THE ORIGIN OF THE BENGALESE FINCH

<bodyText confidence="0.98746925" page_id="56379100"  page_num="67" year="" vol="">
In the November-December, 1966, issue of your Avicultural Magazine, the
book Common Cagebirds in America, by Val Clear, is reviewed by a writer identified as
" C. J. O. H." The writer commented, " it is a pity that the erroneous belief in the
hybrid origin of the Bengalese Finch should still be with us."
Mr. Clear's book refers to the ancestry probably including the Striated Finch, the
Indian Silverbill, and the Sharp-tailed Finch. Since several other American books
I have checked also refer to this same origin, I would very much appreciate if you
would advise me as to the true origin of this particular finch.

Mrs. Robert McClintock.
The Bengalese Finch and its ancestry was carefully studied by Dr. E. Eisner, who,
in addition to publishing some of her study of this species in other ornithological
journals, gave the results of her investigations in an article in the Avicultural
Magazine, vol. 63 (1957), pp. 101-8. She showed that it was a form of the Striated
Finch, Lonchura striata. The Sharp-tailed Finch is now regarded as a race of the
latter. Further notes by Dr. Eisner (Avic. Mag., 64 (1958) ; 31-3) and myself
(Avic. Mag., 68 (1962) ; 30-2) showed that hybrids between Bengalese and Silverbills
produced young with variable characters, unlike the typical Bengalese. There seems
to be no reason to doubt Dr. Eisner's conclusions, and it should be remembered that
in the past there was a tendency to attribute hybrid origin to most domesticated
birds, including fowls and pigeons, due apparently to an inability to accept the fact
that the variations shown could be produced by selection for recessive characters.

All the above nutrients are made for human consumption
Things you should know about this food
As will be seen by the above composition of ingredients, this food is a COMPLETELY
NUTRITIONAL FOOD in every respect and practically impossible to be improved by
any addition. It has transpired in various talks our Principal has had with
Humming Bird fanciers, that many add honey, vitamin C syrup, abidec and similar
concentrates, with the mistaken idea they are improving the food. THIS IS NOT SO,
any such additive will unbalance the proven formula and is likely to do more harm than
possible good.
Whilst Stimulite Nectar Food was originally produced for Humming Birds and
Nectarines in general, it is such a complete nutritional food that its range of uses cover
the whole of the animal and bird kingdom. It has many advantages, sick animals who
will normally refuse solid or semi-solid food, will drink nectar with relish, mainly
because of its complete absence of fat-intolerance and its palatability. It will wholly
sustain and build to complete health animals or birds in its entirety, promoting in the
process, a healthy, free from disease, skin, fur or feather.
Most Humming Bird fanciers like to give a fresh or a change of food in the afternoon
or evening; this is a good practice and we have now developed a special ready to mix
food for this purpose, which we have used for many years on our own stocks.
This will be known as

<bodyText confidence="0.964058771428571" page_id="56379114"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
(JVeorhynchus peruvianus )
By Robin L. Restall (Cheam, Surrey, England)
The Brown Grosbeak is a species which, I gather, may well have been
imported into Britain for the first time in 1966. I bought a pair from
Messrs. R. W. and V. K. Drury, which were listed as Slaty-coloured
Seedeaters ( Sporophila schistacea). One can hardly blame Mr. Drury for
getting it wrong because, apart from a line drawing of a head, the
accompanying plate is probably the only illustration ever published of
the species. Certainly the description of S. schistacea in de Schauensee's
list could be read to be very like N. peruvianus.
After successfully identifying the bird with the invaluable assistance
of the skin collection at the British Museum, and the expert advice of
Mr. Derek Goodwin, I wrote to Mr. Allen Silver to see if he had any
record of the species in confinement. Part of Mr. Silver's reply read as
follows : " In all probability, few people in Europe have seen or
owned it, much less bred it. Neunzig, who goes back to Russ, has no
mention in his index, and whatever the London Zoo may have had in
recent times it is not in the last list published. I note Brabourne and
Chubb call the Peruvian bird Brown Grosbeak and the Ecuador race
(apparently shorter) Verreaux's Brown Grosbeak. B.M.C. descrip-
tions, p. 80, Vol. XII, give colour descriptions which imply much
brown and ashy-brown areas in its plumage somewhat different to that
of the grey Sporophila.
" Its female plumage is dissimilar and there is a note of fresh
plumage (December and January) regarding the male. From a head
figure it appears to have a devil of a beak compared with the Sporophila
as a whole, in fact reminding me in that respect of Melopyrrha nigra of
Cuban fame. ..."
I must comment on some points raised in Mr. Silver's letter before
proceeding with my own notes. Firstly, in deference to Brabourne
and Chubb, I have used their English names, but I think they are
inappropriate. Much more suitable names, I suggest, could be
Black-throated Seedeater, or Grosbeak Seedeater. The name of
Brown Grosbeak, in the list of South American birds is misleading, for
at best the birds are ashy-brown above, and " Grosbeak " to me

always suggests a larger bird, and not a Sporophila as this bird quite
clearly is. At the time of writing (December, 1966) both birds are in
a moult.
I know nothing of habitat, range, or distribution, and neither of the
references mentioned by Mr. Silver helps in this direction. The labels
on the skins in the Bird Room suggest that the nominate race is
restricted to the northern half of Peru, while the Ecuador bird is
found roughly in the north-eastern part of that country. Both of these
areas abut the boundary of Colombia, but I have scoured de Schauensee
with no success.
Incidentally, I should make it clear that the genus Neorhynchus only
has the one species, peruvianas. The Peruvian bird is the type, peru-
vianas. The race from Ecuador is known as devronis.
The accompanying colour plate is drawn from life from my first
pair, which I am sure is the Ecuador bird, JV.p. devronis. Knowing the
problems of colour reproduction in all its forms, I doubt if the
subtleties of racial difference could be accurately portrayed.
The male of my pair died of a respiratory complication after about
four months--almost certainly a benign weakness made malignant by
the nasty fogs we had in November. Mr. Drury sent me another male
who is blacker around the face, and slightly smaller in the beak, which
is not so ridged. One of the sketches illustrates the difference.

General notes. --It is a dull sparrowy little bird, barely 4J inches long.
But for the enormity of the bill and the lack of chestnut on the back, it
would look very much like a miniature sparrow. The bill is very large
and compressed in relation to the body size, and it is very powerful.
All three birds have nipped me with considerable strength, and both
males have drawn blood. The legs and feet seem to vary. Some
name tabs at the museum gave " feet : brownish grey " (JV.p. peru -

are different ! The female's feet are hornish. The old male's were
distinctly on the blue-grey side of horn, but the young male's feet are
on the blue-pink side of horn. Irides are dark brown.
Male. --Forehead, lores, crown, ear-coverts, nape, neck, back,
mantle scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts are grey with a
brownish-olive wash. There is a tendency for blackish markings to the
centre of the feathers around the face. The lesser wing-coverts are
olive grey. Median wing-coverts have dark spots at the centre with
white edges to the innermost four or five. The greater wing-coverts are
dark greyish-brown with pale fawnish edges and the secondaries too.
The tertiaries are dark brownish with frayed, very pale margins. The
primary coverts are dark brown--nearly black ; primaries are dark
brown. The inner six of the nine have a white patch near the base (see
sketch). The second, third, fourth, and fifth primaries only have a
notched leading edge. The tail feathers are dull grey-brown, with pale
olive-fawn outer edges. The bill is yellow, growing progressively more
horn colour towards the culmen, which is ridged and brownish.

male, although there are shadow markings of this. Throughout, the
female is a one-shade-lighter version of the male giving a more fawn,
less striated impression. The pale belly and ventral regions are more
creamy than on the male. My female was definitely slightly smaller
than the old male, but is just about as big as the new male.
Sub-specific Differences. --The points of difference between the two
races may have escaped me but they appear to be {a) the nominate has
a smaller bill, (b) devronis is slightly browner on the upper parts.
General Behavioural Notes
The flight is direct but light, and they are very nervous and quick to
react to the faintest stimulus. The perching stance is very reminiscent
of a Lonchura as opposed to a Fringillid. I am not very familiar with the
Sporophila , but I suspect it is fairly typical in this respect.
Morrison is generally fairly cautious about the temper of male
Sporophilae and suggests they can be rather nasty at times. My first male
would often threaten other birds with his massive beak half open, but in

a passive, defence threat sort of way. However, he would often hit his
mate with a solid forward thrust with a half-open beak, hitting her
midway on the body. The two mandibles never closed into a bite, and
often the male would never actually connect. It was such a ritualized
movement that I wonder whether it might not signify a more com-
plicated display.
I have studied their roosting habits, and, while they roost near each
other on the same perch, I have never seen them actually touching each

Marchant says that the male performs a song flight with a feeble,
unmusical song in defence of its territory. I have seen no courtship or
pre-mating display song, but the male would often sit up on a perch
outside the entrance hole to the house and sing a fairly continuous weak
little song. He would stop as soon as he realized I was creeping up
through the shrubbery to get a better view. Throughout the perfor-
mance he just sat with scarcely a movement, and completely without
any histrionics at all.

Marchant is extremely helpful here, and is about the only source of
information on the species. Unless otherwise credited, the following is
largely a summary of Marchant's report.
Nest site .--The nest is built in woody herbs, bushes, and small trees,
often more or less slung in a fork, either in the centre or top of a small
plant, or towards the ends of long branches and among the leaf-
bunches at the outside of crowns of trees. The bird is clearly quite
liberal in its choice of site and will build in almost any species of tree at

any height from about 2 to 23 feet from the ground. There appears to
be a marginal preference for muyuyo or porotillo.
In broad-leaved bushes the nests are often arranged just below a
leaf, which then forms a sort of lid. This may have some significance
to the aviculturist, and, when I turn my birds out in the spring, I will
see that at least one nest site has this kind of situation.
Nest .--A thinly woven, open cup, about 4-5 cm. across and 3 *5 cm.
deep. It is usually a mere network of material, through which the
contents are easily visible, nearly always of a bright brown or greenish
brown, hirsute tendrils of a certain unidentified creeping or trailing
plant. These are invariably fresh and impart an unmistakable
appearance and show at once if the nest is new because the material
fades before the young fledge. Later in the season, some nests are made
of dry grass, but these are exceptional. Only the male has been seen
actually building the nest.
Eggs and Clutch .--The normal clutch is two or three (average 2 'fig).
The eggs, quite variable in shape, size, and marking, are laid daily,
and all hatch out together after 11 1 days. There are up to three broods
in a season.
Nestlings .--The young birds obviously grow quickly, as they are able
to leap from the nest at eight days old, if disturbed, and scramble away
on the ground. This must have survival value in the face of a par-
ticular predator(s). It is certainly worth remembering for the
aviculturist, as some precocious young nestlings are almost impossible
to persuade to return to their nest. The adults do not remove the
faeces from the nest so they collect round the rim, and probably on

the ground below the nest to some extent. The youngsters fledge in
about ten to eleven days.
The food, as seen through the transparent skin of the young, appears
to be all grass seeds. Marchant does not comment on the food of the
adults, and the labels on the skins at the museum do not help either.
But this remark does tally with my comments in the " Food " section.
Food
Mr. Drury told me that the birds had been shipped on budgie mix
(canary seed and mixed millets) together with some sunflower, which
they should be able to deal with easily judging by their beak.
I have kept both pairs under controlled conditions, when first
owned--followed by a couple of months in a planted garden flight--
then in a cage again. Throughout the whole time I have watched their
diet carefully, and they only eat millet.
Food taken readily : millet on the spray and white (pearl) millet.
Food taken in small quantities : brown millet (pannicum, etc.).
Food tasted, but not at all significant (below 5 per cent in total,
I suggest) : canary seed, canary mixture, hemp, paddy.
Food ignored (as far as can be judged) : Apple, pear, banana,
grapes, peach, sunflower, mealworms, maggots, earwigs, cherries,
cooked peas, oats.
There was plenty of growing grass in the flight, but I never saw the
birds on the ground other than to drink.

Many reports on breeding and other aspects of parrot behaviour
appear in Avicultural Magazine, Australian Aviculture , and other
such journals. A recent example is that of Brown (1966). However,
few of the reports contain the special information which would be of
most use to the investigators here working on the behaviour and
evolution of parrots. The reason for this is obvious enough : avi-
culturists cannot observe and report on all the behaviour of all the birds
in their aviaries. On the other hand, if a short list of behaviour patterns
of especial interest were to be listed, many aviculturists might enjoy
looking for this data and subsequently publishing their results in
avicultural journals. Further, we would be very happy to store this
information in a systematic way if it were to be sent to us directly.
Our primary aim is to elucidate the evolution of social behaviour in
parrots, and we hope from this to learn much of the adaptive signi-
ficance of social behaviour. One of our major tasks is to place the
present-day parrots of the world in their correct natural groupings.
To do this we are using all possible evidence ; for example, soft and
bony morphology, zoogeography, ecology, and behaviour. It is in this
last category that we lack much information which could be supplied
by aviculturists. I shall outline some of the data which could be
obtained which we badly need.

Method of scratching the head region with the foot ; is it over the
wing, or under the wing ? Broadtail Parrots (Platycercus , Barnardius,
Purpuriecephalus) and related parrots ( Psephotus , Neophema) always
scratch over the wing. Galahs, White Cockatoos ( Cacatua ), and Black
Cockatoos ( Calyptorhynchus ) scratch under the wing. All the true
Brushtongues ( Trichoglossus , Glossopsitta , etc.) also scratch under the
wing. On the other hand, some species of Opopsitta , and the Swift
Parrot (Lathamus diversicolor) scratch over the wing, as does the
Budgerygah ( Melopsittacus undulatus) and the Quarrion ( Nymphicus
hollandicus) . We should like to obtain the maximum amount of further
evidence on the manner or scratching in parrots.

Cockatoos and platycercines (i.e. broad tails) hold food in the foot.
Budgerygahs and Quarrion never do. Further data are required,

The colour of down varies between genera and families and appears
to be a useful character.
We have a large body of information already under these headings,
especially for Australian parrots. We are, however, lacking in much of
this sort of detail for non-Australian forms, and we should like to have
further evidence wherever it is available. Variation, which un-
doubtedly occurs in different degree in different forms is especially
interesting.
In addition to behaviour data, there is also a need for the bodies of
dead birds for morphological studies. Here again our gaps are chiefly
in the non-Australian forms. Dead material can be sent in plastic bags
containing a small volume of formalin, if the belly is opened and some
formalin is placed around the viscera and in the pleural cavity.
All aid of this kind received directly will be of great benefit to us and
will be correctly acknowledged. We shall endeavour to answer any ;
queries that are sent. While we would like to receive data direct it is
clearly important that information of this sort should be published by
those collecting and assessing it, in avicultural journals. In this way it
is accessible to all who are interested.

(.Paradoxornis gularis fokiensis)
By Peter J. Levi (The Zoological Society of London)
The information supplied in this paper, was acquired partly from
observations on five of these interesting birds in a large aviary in the
Bird House at the London Zoo. The aviary is very large and
picturesque, containing two big ponds surrounded by much peat,
which is adorned with two trees and many rocks ; in the foreground
there is an expanse of concrete. There, birds share the aviary with
a variety of other passerines--Bulbuls, Tanagers, Starlings, etc.--as
well as many aquatic species--Avocets, rails, etc.
The central and east Asian sub-family of crow-tits (Panurinae),
also known as parrotbills or suthoras, present something of a problem
to taxonomists, because although their feeding habits and nest-building
recall the babblers, the thick bristle covering the nostrils, ten primary
feathers, and the similarity of the plumage of the young to that of the
adults, simulate the true crows and tits ; in fact, they were formerly
classified with the latter family. To confuse the layman even more,
their bills, as the name parrotbill relates, is reminiscent of the parrots
(Psittacidae), but they have no connection with that family at all. There
are seventeen species of Paradoxornis. Another member of this sub-
family which was formerly classified with the titmice, is the Bearded
Tit ( Panurus biarmicus ), which, in view of this fact, is more aptly
described by its Norfolk names of Reedling or Reed Pheasant. The
Wren-tit ( Chamaea fasciata) of California and coastal Oregon is some-
times put in this sub-family also, but is so unusual that some authorities
have even placed it in a family by itself (Chamaeidae) ; according to
Peters' Check-list of Birds of the World , however, it is a member of the
babbler family (Timaliinae).
The head-plumage of this bird is very striking, indeed, even clown-
like, viz. the forehead, stripe extending back to the nape, and throat,
being black ; eye-ring, lores, broad moustache, and chin (the latter
being marked with black), white ; rest of head rich grey. The entire
upper-parts, including the wings and tail, rufous-brown, the inner
webs of the wing-feathers being darker. The under-parts are creamy-
white, the sides of breast and flanks being tinged with buff, though
this is subject to seasonal variation. The bill is orange, iris dark-brown,
legs and feet light blue-grey with whitish claws.
They are extremely agile and tit-like in their acrobatic behaviour--
they will often turn in a complete circle on a branch whilst engaged in
ripping strips of bark from it. This is an act born of purely destructive
motives, as very little, if indeed any at all, is actually consumed.

P. J. LEVI-THE FOHKIEN GREY-HEADED CROW-TIT
These birds are very sociable with other members of their species (in
the wild all crow-tits travel in parties, often quite large ones, in search
of food), but often aggressive toward other species--all five of them at
Regent's Park once attacked a Red-headed Marsh Bird (a Blackbird-
sized bird with quite a formidable bill) when the latter was introduced
into the aviary. They were often observed chasing each other among
the trees, during which they emitted a constant series of chirping noises ;
I have also known them to produce a nasal " cher , cher ". Much social
preening was also seen to take place, and they would always roost
together, bodies touching, on a branch. When on the ground, their
mode of locomotion is a series of hops--another Paradine feature.
In the wild, the diet of this bird is tree-buds, seeds, etc., as well as
insects and larvae, and the latter, so Mr. J. J. Yealland informs me, are
often obtained by biting open the stems of bamboos. In the Zoo, I have

seen them take sultanas, insect-mixture, tomato, orange, and seed, the
larger food being held down with the feet, tit fashion, and ripped
apart with the powerful bill.
Although the birds at Regent's Park have never built a nest or laid
eggs, the nesting is worth mentioning, however, as their nests are fine
examples of bird architecture. They are beautiful cup-shaped structures
composed of strips of bamboo, cobwebs, and lined with fine grass, one
of which La Touche found 14 feet up on a bamboo at Kuatun.
Also known as the Chinese Hoary-headed Crow-tit, this is a race
from south-eastern China, and is about 7 inches in length.

BREEDING THE PEARL-HEADED SILVERBILL
(Odontospiza caniceps)
By P. Scally (Grendon Underwood, Bucks, England)
I am really a novice at breeding birds, and in 1966 was the first time
I ever bred any birds. I do not think it would have been possible to
breed my Pearl-headed Silverbills if I had not bought an outside aviary.
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.956514791666667" page_id="56379126"  page_num="81" year="" vol="">
In 1966 I bought an aviary from Stoners of Crawley, Sussex, their
Model " C ". Length 7 feet, width 4 feet, height 6 feet at the eaves.
The birds were placed in the aviary as soon as it was constructed,
and within a day or so they started taking lengths of grass about
15 inches long to the nesting baskets which I had previously placed
there. During the time this was happening I kept a continual supply
of long bladed soft grass on the aviary floor. After a few days the birds
deserted this nest and I could not understand why. Thinking that they
needed more nesting materials I placed a few packets of nesting materials
which I had bought, in the aviary, but these were completely ignored.
I then decided to try feathers which I obtained from one of my wife's
cushions, much to her annoyance. She is now glad I did this because
the birds started building again, using the feathers from the cushion.
The first egg was laid on 16th June, then one each day until there was
a clutch of six. All the eggs were white without any marks at all.
Both the parents took turns to incubate the eggs.
Five out of the six eggs hatched and in the other one there was a
dead chick in the shell. Within a few days two of the young had died
so I removed them from the nest.
On 27th July the three remaining youngsters left the nest for the
first time, but on the same day one was killed by my neighbour's cat
when it landed on the wire.
The young birds were exactly the same colour as the parents except
they did not have the same speckles on their head.

The food consisted of mixed millet and canary with "Johnsons
Vit-min " mixed in with it. They were also supplied with soaked
millet, millet sprays, seeded grasses, and a continual supply of fresh
clean maggots which they really enjoyed. I also gave them fresh chick-
weed every day.
Also in the aviary with the Pearl-heads were two pairs of Bengalese,
one pair of Aurora finches, one pair of Lavender finches, and one pair of
Red-eared Waxbills.
On 12th August the Pearl-heads started laying a new clutch, which
all hatched out, but within a week all of them had died.
At the end of autumn I brought my Pearl-heads inside.
At the end of October I lost the hen of the pair which I had bred.
This year, if all goes well, I intend to use my Bengalese as foster
parents for the Pearl-heads' eggs, and place the Bengalese's eggs under
the Pearl-heads. Perhaps by doing this I will have better success.
I hope that what I have written may help your members, but if any
of them have specific questions they need answering I will be only too
pleased to answer them.

BREEDING OF TASMANIAN ROSELLA

hook-beaks per flight and attribute my success in breeding hook-beaks
to this.
I also have one flight 50 feet long by 15 feet wide and 8 feet high
with a shelter at each end where I keep any odd birds plus a few pairs.
It was in this flight that I had a hen Pileated and a cock Tasmanian.
In 1964 the cock spent a lot of time with the hen and on odd occasions
I saw him feeding her but that was all they did. On 24th November,
1965, I noticed the hen was missing and on looking in some nest-boxes
I had just put up a few days earlier found her in one with an egg.
I looked in each day and found she had laid five eggs by the end of the
fifth day. They all proved fertile and the first one hatched on the
eighteenth day and one each day after that. I should add that the hen
was very wild up to going to nest and was very hard to get a good look
at in the aviary as she flew around so fast. But she became very quiet
and I could lift her off her eggs and, later, chicks without her getting
upset. At six weeks of age all five chicks left the nest and although not
very brightly coloured were obviously three cocks and two hens. At

four months I lost the cock Tasmanian and three of the young with
round worms but managed to save two young cocks. I had to dose
them often to keep them alive but since have had no trouble. At six
months these birds were showing a lot of colour being somewhat like
a Rosella in shape but the colouring threw to the Pileated. I had
considerable success at bird shows in the Hybrid class winning at the
National bird show with one.
This season I had hopes of mating the Pileated hen to one of the
hybrids but it did not show any interest in her although she went to
nest on five eggs and sat solid for seven weeks. They have now coloured
up into magnificent birds and I will try one again this season with the
hen.

THE BIRDS OF BULGARIA
By Nikolav Boev (Research Associate, Institute of Zoology, Bulgarian
Academy of Sciences)

<bodyText confidence="0.9934184" page_id="56379128"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
An exceptional variety of mountains with snowy peaks and dark-green
conifers, crystal-clear mountain lakes, meandering brooks, calm
swamps, a most picturesque coast, golden fertile plains, and cool
deciduous forests constitutes the colourful habitat of 325 species of birds
which occur in Bulgaria. This is the area, crossed by the Balkan Range,
which forms part of the routes of the migratory birds from Eastern
Europe to the warm south in autumn and from sunny Africa to the
north in spring. One of the most important among these routes is that
along the coast of the Black Sea. Numerous flights follow one another
along this aerial " Via Pontica " and they find temporary refuge in our
country. A very mild winter in the southern parts of Thrace, along the
foothills of the Strandja Mountain (as also at the mouth of the beautiful
Ropotamo which is a game reserve), and along the valleys of the Mesta
and Struma the routes the birds take toward the Aegean, makes winter
quite a small hazard there as only a small area is covered with snow.
That is why birds often find it a very nice place and quite a number
forget about their Mediterranean passports and spend the winter there.
It is no exception for that favourite of all hunters--the Woodcock--to
decide to stay in this winter residence for a long time, while the
large doves may choose to stay there throughout the whole winter.
Again in winter, one can see roaming flights of various birds or single
specimens. The towns and villages then become the gathering places
for roamers such as Crested Larks, Yellowhammers, tits, Bramblings,
etc. Other winter guests are the melancholy Waxwings which come
from the woods of northern Europe and which like to concentrate in

the parks, being particularly fond of the pods with sticky seeds hanging
on the Japanese acacia [Sophora japonica).
At the moment when we are hanging the new calendar on the wall,
the return flight has already started. It is led by the small ducks--the
teals--or by the large Mallards. The spring procession then continues
with many more species and it probably finishes at the end of April or
the beginning of May. It is then that the master-singer, the Nightingale,
sings its unscored romances, and the clumsy Dalmatian pelicans in the
Sreburna reserve make enormous nests of dry cane in which later on
the shaky, ugly, though in a way handsome baby pelicans appear. At
this time, too, the red-winged Wallcreeper has already returned to the
mountain and flies from rock to rock like a large exotic butterfly in
search of food for its young. The serenades of the enamoured Caper-
caillie are over and his harem has already been dismissed. In the
plains below, another troubadour, the Quail, repeats his hysterical
appeal and from the hollows in the trees in the city parks rise the wide
open bills of the hungry progeny of the Syrian Woodpecker. The [
noisy Herring Gulls brood in their nests on the roofs of Varna and
Bourgas, while the elegant Avocets and Black-winged Stilts lay their
eggs by the salt ponds near Pomorie. In Plovdiv and in Pazardjik, in
addition to the common Kestrel, the Lesser Kestrel from the south is
also to be seen on the roofs of the old houses. There are birds all around,
and it is a good thing that over 200 species are protected by law in
Bulgaria--be it because they are rare, be it because they are useful, or
simply because we like them and we feel they are necessary to Nature.
Not many species are kept in captivity and I will only mention a few.
The most numerous are probably the descendants of the Rock Dove.
We must thank the dove-breeders for their love of these birds which
has helped to preserve certain old breeds of doves which are no longer
to be seen in the Orient and are unknown to the pigeon-fanciers in
Western Europe.
Canaries in Bulgaria belong to no particular race, and their colours
are snowy-white, yellow--varying from pale lemon to almost saffron
orange--and from olive to greenish-brown or spotted and mottled.
There are also crested canaries, which are somewhat like the English
Norwich. Our canaries are quite hardy and can live at ordinary room
temperatures and this does not interfere with their singing. Certain
canary-breeders prefer to train them to sing like a Nightingale, and
since the song of our southern Nightingales is much more mellow, with
a velvety timbre, the singing of the canary-pupils is bound to be similar.
That is why their songs are softer and more sonorous, and not as shrill
as is the case with Canaries taught by the Thrush-Nightingale. The
Thrush-Nightingale never breeds in our country but passes through in
flights from the north, as early as August. I know a lorry-driver, a
friend of mine, who kept southern Nightingales for tutors, and he used

to listen to them very carefully before catching them in the localities
where they were singing, because, in his opinion, there were certain
important differences in them. He put so much loving care in looking
for his Nightingale-tutors that one of them used to sing from dawn till
dusk in winter as well. It stopped singing only during the moult, to
start anew immediately after.
My friend has long ago released all his Nightingales. The age of
technical progress offered him its tape recorders, and his young
Canaries are now enriching their musical culture from recordings.
The Australian Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) is yet another
introduction which appears not only in its natural green colour but
also in all the variations achieved by breeding these birds. There are
white specimens with sky-blue markings, pale yellow ranging up to
intense yellow, others ranging from reseda to grass green, and still
others varying from cobalt blue to lead grey. The unfailing optimism
and buoyancy of these birds convey the idea of " perpetuum mobile ".
The third cage bird is also an introduction. This is the domesticated
Barbary Dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea ). It is a distant relative of the
migratory Turtle Dove and seems to be closely related to the wintering
Eastern Collared Dove (S. deco acta) in Bulgaria. This is a modest bird
and it makes no great bid to be classified as a singer, but its frequent
repetition of " cucurrru, coo " followed by continuous giggling is very
pleasant. In addition, it is a lovely creature to look at. These Turtle
Doves are found in two colours : creamy or sandy yellow and white,
but the white doves are comparatively poor fliers. Some ten years ago
I had the chance of observing a family of wild Turtle Doves. They had
acclimatized themselves of their own free will and spent three years in
an old tree in one of the Sofia parks where they had their nest. This
couple used to repel with aggressive and militant postures all their
relatives--the domesticated wild Turtle Doves--that tried to approach
them.
Unlike certain European countries, as is the case with Italy and
France, for instance, the law in our country forbids the catching and
killing of Starlings, Thrushes, Blackbirds, Skylarks, and buntings.
That is why in our country there is little netting of birds, nor are
gourmets interested in the piquancy of pates prepared from the meat
of singing birds. Is it not better for these birds to be allowed to live in
freedom ?
There are a number of other singing birds that are bred occasionally
in the country, in particular the beautiful Goldfinch. Bird-fanciers are
sometimes very happy when they can obtain hybrids, resulting from
crossing a female Canary with a male Goldfinch. Sometimes, however,
the result obtained follows the example given by Bernard Shaw and
the offspring may have none of the beautiful feathers of the father nor
any of the rich song of the mother. Another bird of this category is the

handsome Siskin, then more rarely the Linnet, the plain Greenfinch,
and the humble Bullfinch. Crossbills, Chaffinches, and buntings are
usually spared by the bird-catchers.
As for the pigeons bred in the country, there is such a great variety
of them that many would be valuable acquisitions to pigeon-breeders
regardless of the particular breeds they may like : sporting pigeons that
fly well and can perform interesting figures, or pigeons that are just
beautiful to look at. This is a very rich choice.

By S. T. Johnstone (The Wildfowl Trust, Slimbridge, Glos., England)
During the past fifteen years 195 Hawaiian Geese have been reared
at Slimbridge, and from birds distributed to other collections a further
124 have been raised.
The Slimbridge birds have been segregated for breeding purposes.
The male is very aggressive when the female is laying or incubating.
Whilst he is prepared to attack geese twice his size, we have felt that
he might not be able to sustain a fight against some of the opposition
he might meet in our communal pens. The ideal size for a breeding
pen is 300 square yards of grazing. The amount of water can be quite
small for in their native land there are few ponds. In consequence they
seldom swim and prefer to walk round the pond rather than to cross it.
Copulation invariably takes place on land.
Naturally we paid great attention to our first Ne-nes. Little straw
huts were built to shelter them on cold winter nights. In practice it
was found that the apprehension caused by driving the birds to get
them in probably outweighed the advantage gained. Furthermore, the
cold appeared to cause no undue hardship. But the huts did serve a
useful purpose for in each case they were used by the birds as a nesting
site. The straw huts have been superseded by wigwams. These are
made by pushing willow wands into the ground on the circumference
of a 2-foot circle, and tying them together about 3 feet up. An entrance
is left about a foot wide.
The Ne-ne goose almost invariably lays at two years. Generally the
birds lay two clutches and often a third, the number of eggs varying
between three and five. On Hawaii the birds nest in November, here
the earliest eggs have been in mid-January, but more usually in
February. The first goslings we had in 1952 were hatched with 2 inches
of snow on the sitting-box. Generally an egg is laid on alternate days
but there have been cases where three eggs have been laid in four days.
Throughout the years a number of females have been lost through

impaction of the oviduct. Subsequent post-mortem examination has
shown a great deal of fat deposited not only below the skin but also
around the viscera. This condition we sought to eliminate by changing
the diet from wheat to barley but the birds would not take the latter.
We then changed, on expert advice, to a diet of turkey starter crumbs
which proved acceptable and for some years appeared to increase the
fertility. One feels that a possible explanation for the excess fat in the
laying bird might well be due to the fact that nesting here takes place
at a time of year when the birds have stored up the adipose tissue for
winter protection. Perhaps if other species of geese were induced to
lay at this time of the year they would likewise suffer from oviductal
impaction.
The original trio of birds were a great success in that the male served
both females quite adequately. This happy situation was due to the
fact that the females elected to come into laying condition at different
times, the male being extremely attentive to the laying female. When
the eggs were removed and the nest destroyed he would transfer his
affection to the second bird which had commenced nest building.
Subsequent attempts to " trio " the birds have been unsuccessful
where both females commenced nesting activities at the same time.
We have almost invariably removed the clutches and incubated the
eggs under bantams, partly because the birds are thus induced to lay a
second clutch and partly because of loss of eggs from predation. On
the few occasions when the eggs have been left for the female to
incubate, desertion has taken place towards the end of the incubation
period, the one exception being where a pair hatched and reared five
goslings.
The following table shows the annual results for each of the fifteen
years. In all 1,162 eggs have been incubated of which 40 per cent were
fertile, 50 per cent of fertile eggs hatched, and 81 per cent of hatched
goslings were reared :--

A considerable number of the goslings were helped out of the shell.
This is probably a doubtful practice. Certainly more could have been
hatched by the Caesarean method but one wonders in the long run if
it is beneficial to hatch out the weak goslings. Of course, in a species
so rare, the temptation is very great. The goslings have come in two
kinds of down. The one with normal thick woolly variety, the other
with thin pale " cottony " down. There appeared to be no difference
in the vigour of the two kinds and after feathering no distinction could
be detected. On one occasion a gosling on feathering had a completely
black neck but unfortunately it only survived for six months. The
young in their own country are fond of watercress and sow thistle.
Here the babies are always provided with the former of which they are
particularly fond. We have tried watercress on other species without
success.
Ne-ne goslings are quite hardy and apart from an occasional
malformation of a particular bird, losses have been mostly from gapes
and aspergillosis. One must assess the high infertility either as a result
of interbreeding or possibly as a factor which has helped to bring the
species to near extinction. From the data it is obvious that the first
birds to arrive at Slimbridge had a relatively high fertility rate and
this declined considerably over the years. In 1964 two males containing
wild blood were sent over from Pohakaloa, the geese that these birds
were paired to have shown a high fertility rate.
It appears that incubation should be studied. Our method of using
hens and bantams instead of incubators is adequate in the general run.
Something between 80 and 85 per cent of fertile eggs are hatched. By
comparison the Ne-ne hatch is bad (50 per cent). Whether this is due
to cold weather at the time of incubation or to a weak germ or a
combination of both, it is difficult to say.
Our research department has now taken on the problem of looking
into ways and means of increasing the fecundity of our flock and it is
hoped that their findings will enable us to increase the world population
of this enchanting goose at a considerably greater rate.

By Harry Frauca (Canberra, A.C.T., Australia)
Around Christmas, summer time in Australia, is the breeding season
of the fascinating kingfishers. At that time the laughing Kookaburra
(.Dacelo novaeguineae ), one of the world's largest kingfishers, is busy
either feeding its young or protecting the nesting hole. The brightly
coloured Forest and Sacred Kingfisher fly swiftly about, pouncing on
insects or chasing birds that trespass into their breeding territories.
The Azure Kingfisher, sky-blue on the back and wings, can be seen
disappearing with an insect in its bill inside a burrow on a river bank.
Kingfishers are found throughout a large section of the world and
are characterized by long sharp bills and rapid flight. Most females nest
in burrows or tree holes and produce round white eggs.
Dr. Ben Keast divided the kingfishers of Australia into two main
types ; the wood kingfishers that have medium tails and bills, live in
the forest and usually pick up the food from the ground, i.e. the
Kookaburra, the Sacred and the Forest Kingfishers. And the water
kingfishers that have long bills, short tails, and dive for fish, tadpoles,
small frogs and others, i.e. the Azure Kingfisher.
In this article we are concerned with the wood kingfishers of which
this writer did a four-year study.
The Sacred and Forest Kingfishers (Halcyon sancta and H. macleayii)
are both migratory species breeding (in north-eastern Australia)
between September-October and April; thereafter both adult and
juvenile birds fly north to New Guinea and other islands where they
remain until the next Australian spring.
The Kookaburra, on the other hand, is more or less sedentary and,
if not disturbed, a population of these birds may stay in the same bush
for years. But like the Sacred and Forest Kingfisher, the Kookaburra
too commences breeding around October or so in north-eastern
Australia and occupies more or less the same habitat as the other two
kingfishers ; in fact, the three species can breed in the same area.
In my Queensland study-area, the three species above always nest
either in tree holes or hollow spouts up trees, or make a tunnel or
burrow on a termite mound up a tree. Arboreal termitaria are very
common in these parts of Australia, some trees, mainly wattles (Acacia)
having enormous clay mounds built by termites high on the tree-trunk.
A large mound may take upwards of twenty years to be built by the
industrious termites.
The association between those three kingfishers and the termite
mounds is a fascinating subject for studies. This is how it goes ; a pair
of kingfishers selects its breeding territory in a given area in which
there are arboreal termitaria. Approximately between early October

and mid-November, our hypothetical pair of birds alternate feeding
with periods of resting and burrowing in termite mounds. Suddenly,
a bird will land on a termite mound, hang on there with its feet and
peck away at the clay-like material. After a few strokes of its bill, it
ceases work and flies away to perch again. Down comes its partner
and it too proceeds to hammer away at the mound with its bill.
There is evidence that a pair of kingfishers can make more than one
burrow during the breeding season, as almost every termite mound in
the area of study has at least two to three burrows. In some cases,
there is evidence that the same burrow may be used by kingfishers over
several consecutive years but this has not yet been confirmed. To do
so, some birds should be banded and captured periodically. We do
know, however, that a population of Sacred and Forest Kingfishers |
may utilize the same breeding area year after year.
The entrance of the burrow on the termite mound is about 2 inches
in diameter and of circular shape. The depth of the burrow varies but
it can be upwards of 2 feet deep. Many of these burrows are dug in
live termite mounds so that, in effect, the breeding birds and their
young live in association with the termites or white ants. It has been
suggested, but not proved, that the young may actually eat termites
while they remain in the burrow. But the adult kingfishers may also
dig burrows in dead termite mounds in which case the young could not
rely on getting white ants at all.
The Kookaburra too utilizes termite mounds for nesting purposes.
Being a much bigger bird than the Sacred and Forest Kingfisher, the
Kookaburra's burrow is considerably bigger too, the entrance, also
circular, is over 4 inches in diameter and the depth of the burrow well
over 2 feet. Usually, the Kookaburra chooses larger termite mounds
than the other kingfishers.
The three species, however, may also nest in tree holes or in hollow
spouts of trees, or may make a burrow on a soft slope. But where
termite mounds are available both the Sacred and the Forest King-
fishers nest in those and the same, with some exceptions, can be said of
the Kookaburra.
The three kingfishers are very pugnacious and defend their breeding
holes most tenaciously. If you climb up a tree on which the burrow
contains either eggs or young, the parent birds will usually put on an
aggressive display which consists of loud alarm cries with " dive-
bombing " attacks upon the intruder, the birds passing only a few
inches from the intruder's head. These displays are regarded as bluff
rather than real attacks but there are exceptions.
Sugar-chemist Paul Farmer of Bundaberg, Queensland, a keen
amateur bird-watcher was examining the nest of a Kookaburra in the
hollow spout of a tree in November, 1966. There were four eggs inside
and he was holding one in his hand when suddenly one of the parent

birds dived down and struck Farmer on the side of his head with its
powerful bill.
The blow drew blood and such appears to have been the force of the
impact that the Kookaburra fell to the ground stunned. It took a few
moments to recover and so fly again. Farmer himself was feeling pretty
shaky as he climbed down the tree.
Ornithologists, however, believe that the Kookaburra and the other
kingfishers 5 attacks are usually bluff and that if the bird does hit a
human as it hit Paul Farmer, it may be an accident. That is, the
Kookaburra might have miscalculated distances and hence collided
with the man's head. They point out that the head and neck bones of
the bird are not really strong enough to withstand the impact of such
a crash and that after many of those crashes, the bird could sustain
internal injuries.
At present there is much evidence to indicate that most birds
synchronize laying with a time of the season when, on hatching, the
young will have plenty of food, mainly insects which form the main bulk
of the diet of young birds. In Australia an abundance of insects
usually follows periods of rain. Thus, the kingfishers too usually lay at
a time when, on hatching, there will be plenty of insects for the young.
The Kookaburra, however, feeds abundantly on small lizards and
also on small snakes as well as on birds and mice. But, perhaps, insects
constitute the main diet of the nestlings.
In any case, in our study area, eggs were found in the burrows of
Kookaburras, Sacred and Forest Kingfishers early in November and
young towards the end of the month when the bush was teeming with
insects and small skinks.
On hatching, the young of the three species are completely naked of
feathers and with their eyes shut. The incubation period of the eggs
varies. Of the Kookaburra, Sydney bird-watcher Keith Hindwood
said that it lasted between twenty-seven and twenty-nine days. The
young opened their eyes when ten days old and stayed with the parents
for a month or two.
The incubation of the eggs of the Forest and Sacred Kingfishers
takes about twenty days and the young stay in the burrows for some
twenty-five days or so. After this, they remain in the neighbourhood
until around April when, together with the adults, they set off on their
migration journey to the islands north of Australia where they spend
the winter.
The breeding burrow of the Sacred and Forest Kingfishers can be
extremely dirty and evil smelling. The young pass their waste products
near the entrance of the burrow but even so the place is permeated by
a very strong smell. Usually, the parents feed the young more inten-
sively early in the morning and during late afternoon. At these times,
every few minutes, one of the parent kingfishers flies in with an insect

in its bill, lands at the entrance of the burrow, hangs on there by its
feet, deposits the food inside, and flies away again, the whole operation
taking only a few moments.
The Kookaburra, the Sacred and the Forest Kingfishers are very
common throughout a large section of Australia occupying a wide
variety of habitat. From a scientific point of view, the association of
these birds with termite mounds is interesting and fascinating to watch.
Few sights in the bush are as quaint as that of a Kookaburra hammering
away at a termite mound on a tree with its big bill so that, gradually, it
makes a nesting burrow in it. And then the young hatch out of the
eggs and for many days live in the depths of the mound, sharing their
world with the industrious white ants which live in the honeycomb of
cells inside the mound*
But as far as colour is concerned, the Sacred and Forest Kingfishers
steal the show for they are amongst the most vividly coloured birds in
our bush. As they fly swiftly by, their sky blue and green feathers
catch the sun and glitter with the most glorious colours.

By H. E. Hitchin (Skenfrith, Abergavenny, Mon.)
I have been concerned for some time--like most aviculturists
keeping softbills--as to the position of our live food supplies.
The reported almost total demise of mealworm stocks on the
Continent, from where most of our supplies derive, gave rise to the
thought are we feeding them correctly ?
Some years ago I lived in the house adjacent to an old water mill
when it closed down. I had no difficulty in finding supplies of meal-
worms in the offal left lying about in odd places in the mill. They were
always well matured and in good condition.
When I came to purchase supplies this past season I had difficulty in
recognizing them as the same species so thin and undernourished were
they on arrival.
Consequently, on turning to maggots, when mealworms were no
longer available, I decided to carry out a series of experiments on
feeding them from the time of their arrival until they were all con-
sumed by the birds--in my case a period of a fortnight or so.
I approached the problem from the premise, that if the maggots
were not fed at all during the intervening period then they must live on
their own fat until turning into chrysalis. It was found that maggots
up to a certain age do actually continue to feed if food is made available
this being proved by the incorporation of grated carrot in the mixture
the colour being reflected in the gut of the larvae.
Not only so, but the quality of the maggot was well nourished right
until the last one was consumed, the fat body being pearly white
turning into a yellowish buttermilk colour before turning into chrysalis.
The following method I find to be convenient in my own case.
On arrival the maggots are turned into a cylindrical drum made of
three-ply wood and given a good handful of crushed oats and left for
24 hours to clean themselves.
The following day they are fed a basic mixture of:--

cellophane is turned over and the maggots will soon congregate
underneath.
After a few days it will be found that it is mostly the younger ones
that are taking the food the older ones keeping to the crushed oats
which require replenishing at the end of the first week. At the end of
the fortnight the drum is thoroughly scoured and dried in the sun before
restocking. The following additives have all been successfully tried :--
Honey, Malt extract, " Lassie " a liver-rich dog food, they being

Others, like tinned vegetable foods, suggest themselves.
The procedure is strongly to be recommended to those feeding live
food to all softbills.

Several of the more commonly exhibited birds which were obtained
in order that our exhibits were well stocked for opening day last year,
have now been replaced with rarer species ; and this is to be our
policy for the next two or three years until our goal--of exhibiting one
of the finest collections of rare softbills in the world--has been reached.
Since Christmas some very interesting birds have been acquired, the
most important being a trio of African Jacanas, a Lesser Green
Broadbill and a Chestnut-bellied Rock Thrush--a very attractive and
seldom exhibited species. We have also received pairs of Natal Robins,
Orange Gorgetted and Tickell's Flycatchers, Black-chinned Tit-
Babblers and Yuhinas, and a young male Orange Cock-of-the-Rock ;
whilst the addition of Tacazzi, Purple and Purple-rumped Sunbirds
brings the total of this family on exhibit to eight species.
The " freeflight " area, where the emphasis is upon large softbills,
has been enhanced by the addition of three Indian Pied Hornbills, and
a group of Roseate Spoonbills have been purchased for the open-
fronted waders exhibit.

Among the new arrivals is a specimen of the Sharp-tailed Conure
(.Aratinga a . acuticaudata ) and this appears to be only the second to be
received since the first came in 1868.
A pair of Cheriway Carrion Hawks and a pair of Hammerkops are
other notable arrivals. Two Wood Rails bred at Bristol Zoo have been
received, but not as yet identified : they are somewhat like Aramides
cajanea.
Owls so far hatched in the Gardens are three Great and three
Kenya Eagle-Owls : the Spotted (both the nominate race and the
northern cinerascens ) Eagle-Owls are incubating eggs and the Magellan
has laid, but the eggs have been broken. Javan Fish-Owls nested earlier
and a chick was hatched, but it disappeared : another egg or eggs are
now being incubated. One of this pair is a bird that was in the Leckford
collection and was received here in 1945.
A Black-footed Penguin has been bred ; also two more Speckled
Pigeons. Blacksmith Plovers hatched three chicks, but they did not
survive and another clutch is now being incubated : Grey-headed
Gallinules nested, but the eight or nine eggs did not hatch. A pair of
Pigmy Falcons ( Polihierax semitorquatus) deposited last autumn were
given a large nesting box in which to roost. They took to this at once
and in January we thought that they must be nesting : an inspection
revealed one white egg which later vanished, but the birds may be
nesting again, for, as before, they are not often both out of the box
together, though, of course, one could not say that they take turns in
incubating. This species breeds naturally in the deserted nests of other
birds such as the Buffalo Weaver.
When a number of Birds of Paradise, presented by Sir Edward
Hallstrom, came in May, 1965, some were put into the outside aviaries
at the Bird House. They have not spent much time during the day in
the outer flights, but come out during the evening or whenever rain is
falling. Now a deep cup-shaped nest has been built by one of the
female Princess Stephanie's ; she chose to build it in a privet hedge
that is divided from the passers-by only by the wire-netting, though a
similar hedge runs along the opposite side of the aviary close by the
division between it and the next compartment--a more secluded and
desirable site, one would think, but evidently the bird thinks otherwise.
To screen the nest from people passing close by we fixed a large sheet
of hardboard between the hedge and the netting, but this had the effect
of causing the bird to start again further along and in an equally
exposed place. The materials used are thin twigs, hay, and grass
provided by us and pieces of paper and cellophane supplied by visitors.

Some assistance was given by us in the form of an old nest of a Blackbird
and some supporting twigs, for the place chosen by the bird provides
little in the way of support for her own efforts. The male is very active
and calls from time to time, but so far no eggs have been laid.

Recently I was asked how to differentiate the Song Thrush ( Turdus
ericetorum) and the Mistle Thrush (T. viscivorus ) ; and, perhaps
somewhat naturally, whence the name of the latter.
Christopher Merrett's Pinax rerum naturalium Britannicum , 1667,
contains the earliest known list of British birds : amonst the 170
species listed is the " Mistletoe Thrush There can be little doubt
that Mistle is a curtailed Mistletoe, hence the spelling Missel, as used
by some, is incorrect.
" There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four
which I know not : The way of an eagle in the air ; the way of a
serpent upon a rock ; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea ; and
the way of a man with a maid." Thus said Agur, son of Jakeh, in the
Book of Proverbs. Alexander Wetmore, with his usual understanding,
has written : " Like Agur, untold numbers of men and women have
marvelled at c the way of an eagle in the air '--or, for that matter, the
way of a sparrow in the garden."

One of our neighbouring villages is Merle Common. All too often
when one inquires of the inhabitants why tjieir village is called such
and such they seem particularly lacking in ideas. But here the answer
is almost invariably that Merle means a Blackbird.
The Blackbird Turdus merula has been known as the Merle from very
early times--perhaps the name was even introduced by the Normans.
But more definite is that Randle Cotgrave, the English lexicographer,
the author of our earliest French dictionary (1611) anglicized Merle as
" a Mearle, Owsell, Blackbird ".
The name is scarcely used nowadays, so it is the more pleasing that
it is perpetuated, even if only in the name of a small Surrey village.

A gardener credited with " green fingers " is supposed to have a kind
of magic touch that makes whatever he plants grow and flourish. But
a very knowing old gardener once told me that he did not believe in
such things--there was no substitute for plenty of dirt under the
finger-nails !
In the realm of aviculture, however, there are those who seemingly
have a magic touch--many a breeding success has been achieved in
what might be considered far from ideal conditions. I have sometimes
wondered what could be considered as an avicultural equivalent of
" green fingers ". I need wonder no longer.
In the October, 1966, number of the Avicultural Bulletin it is men-
tioned that Dr. Sibley once referred to Edward Lawson, at one time
Curator at the Fort Worth Zoo, as " the man with the feathered
thumb ".

The Society's Medal was first awarded in 1897. The recipients were
R. A. Todd, for breeding the Long-tailed Grass-finch, Poephila acuti-
cauda , and G. E. Bouskill, for the Golden-headed Parrakeet,
Cyanorhamphus auriceps.
Since then it has been officially awarded on 267 occasions. It is
probable that the number is slightly more than this as the award was
not always entered in the Minutes of the Council Meetings, nor was it
always gazetted in the Magazine.
The highest number of awards is twenty-nine, to Alfred Ezra. Had
our late President claimed all the Medals to which he was undoubtedly
entitled the number would surely have been considerably more.
The runner-up is W. E. Teschemaker with twenty-four. Others to
reach double figures are the Keston partnership--E. J. Boosey (eight),
E. J. Boosey and A. Brooksbank (one), and W. D. Cummings (four)--
with thirteen, and W. Shore Baily, eleven. Mrs. K. M. Scamell has
been awarded nine during the past seven years and it certainly cannot
be long before she, too, reaches double figures.

On the origin of the name of our Society. In 1894 a small group of
bird enthusiasts gathered together with the intention of forming a
society devoted to their interests.
It was found necessary to invent or acclimatize a word which would
denote " a person interested in the keeping and breeding of birds
Aviculturist, being analogous to horticulturist, was considered to be a
very fitting description. According to the Shorter Oxford English
Dictionary : " Aviculture : Rearing of birds ; bird-fancying " has been
in use since 1880, but the adaption appears to be to the credit of our
founders. Prior to that those with interests similar to ours must have
been known simply as bird-fanciers or perhaps aviarists. Aviary is an
Elizabethan word, dating back to 1577. The earliest use I know is
when Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) says that "Lincolnshire may be
termed the aviary of England, for the wild-fowl therein ".
Mention of the foundation of the Society recalls that the roots of the
Society are deep in Brighton. Of the fifty-two Original Members,
fourteen were resident in Brighton. Included in this number were the
Honorary Secretary, Dr. G. S. Simpson, and the Treasurer, H. R.
Fillmer, who were also Joint-Editors of the Magazine : and the
Magazine was printed in Brighton.

The dictionary definition of Isabelline is " of an Isabella colour,
greyish-yellow, dull straw colour It has been bestowed on a Desert
Lark, Wheatear, Turtle Dove, and several other birds. But whence
the name ?
There are two stories, equally improbable, to account for it. Isabel
of Austria, daughter of Philip II, at the siege of Ostend vowed not to
change her linen until the place was taken. As the siege lasted from
1601 to 1604, we may assume that the worthy lady's clothing became
somewhat soiled by three year's wear ! The other story attaches to
Isabella of Castile who, it is said, made a vow to the Virgin not to
change her linen until Granada fell into her hands. Brewer&apos;s Dictionary
of Phrase and Fable says there is no reason for accepting either of these
derivations as the word appears in an extant list of Queen Elizabeth's
clothes, dated July, 1600 : " one rounde gowne of Isabella-colour
sat ten."

The Fiscal or Fiscal Shrike (Lanins collaris) was first named " Le
Fiscal " by Levaillant, in 1799. Perhaps the best explanation of the
office of fiscal is that given by Arthur C. Stark (The Birds of South
Africa , vol. II, page 8). He writes : " This shrike derives its name from
the title of one of the principal government officers in the old Dutch
times in Cape Colony, who had charge of public prosecutions and was
responsible for the administration of justice.
As in those days justice was not always tempered with mercy, the
word ' fiscal 5 has come to signify this most fearless and cruel bird,
which is constantly in pursuit of its prey and which ruthlessly kills and
impales in its larder any creature it is able to overpower."
Levaillant also named the Bacbakiri ( Telophorus zeylonus ), on account
of the onomatopoeic call of the male, expressed as " bac-ba-kiri,
bac-ba-kiri ". This shrike is now usually known in South Africa as the
Bokmakierie, one of its calls being construed as " bok-makierie ".

Visits to Birdland or Rode must surely have made many cherish
dreams of one day possessing a macaw. Some may even have fulfilled
their ambition, but unless exceptional accommodation can be provided
the best advice is perhaps that offered by &amp;lt;c Punch " on another, and
very different, occasion DON&apos;T.
The usual practice is, of course, to keep them chained by one leg to
a macaw stand. Edward Boosey has likened keeping a bird permanently
chained to keeping a dog forever on the lead.
The few macaws imported nowadays are almost invariably nestlings
that have been hand-reared. The majority make intelligent and
affectionate pets, devoted to their owners, but they are inclined to be

spiteful towards strangers, especially children: some of whom do not
always accord them the respect they deserve and who seemingly have
an irresistible urge to pull their tails.
It must be remembered that they can indulge in a terribly loud and
discordant screech, deafening to the owner and hardly conducive to
good neighbourliness. I have known both a macaw and a cockatoo
banished to outbuildings on this account.
C. W. Gedney, writing in the late i87o's gives an horrific account of
a battle between a macaw and a Bull Terrier. He says : "I knew one
bird that defied every effort made to tame him, and he killed a bull
terrier that shared his place in the stables ; you could not live in the
house with him ! Both his wings were broken in this terrific battle, and
a pretty spectacle the place presented when the man went as usual to
feed him in the morning. There lay poor Tyke dead, with his throat
torn open, the bird covered with blood, and almost featherless, stood
by, with destended and drooping wings, a perfect scarecrow, shrieking
at intervals either in pain or spite. What was to be done with the
creature ? Kill him, everyone said, except the man who looked after
the bird ; so his belief that the injuries would tame him saved his life ;
and the cripple was consequently shut up in a pig stye. His wings got
well, the bones growing out of place, but this old savage never abated
one atom of his hatred for everyone that went near him, and he had
ultimately to be poisoned."
A tragedy such as this must surely be unique.

The " Near Miss " in Rearing Humming Birds
I was very interested in the copious article by Mrs. Scamell on the " near miss " in
rearing Humming Birds. I am most surprised, however, that such an experienced
aviculturist should use the formula given for rearing the young. Let us examine
the formula, first, white sugar, the bulk of the food, contains absolutely no nutrients
whatsoever, this is fortified with a protein concoction 60 per cent plus minerals
which are not water-soluble, so that the bird has to stir up with the action of the
tongue to consume any at all. Such a diet is completely devoid of the essential Fat-
soluble Vitamins A, D, and E, etc., all of which are essential to give complete nutrition,
and complete nutrition is the only way anything can be successfully reared. It is
obvious, therefore, that the babies died of malnutrition (starvation), and not
unexpectedly so, the same applies to the failure to rear Sunbirds. It would be a
miracle if such solution would rear anything to maturity.
I would add that if a 4 ounce of pure yeast extract, or 4 ounce of crude black
mollasses were used in the place of the Gerval product, one would have a better food
in every way, but still deficient in the fat-soluble vitamins mentioned.
I feel I am fully qualified to make the above statements by the fact that I have
specialized in Nectar feeders since 1919. I am, as far as I know, the first purveyor to
import Humming Birds, around 1924 and since that time, with the exception of the
war period, and some little time after, been the sole purveyor of these birds until
I dispensed with the services of my collector in Ecuador in early 1963. In all these
forty-seven years I have handled many thousands and in that time I have had over
800 post mortems on Nectar feeders which show that around 95 per cent die from

excess sugar, this results in the almost complete dehydration of the flesh and muscles,
and invariably diseases of the liver, extended, perforated, and cancerous conditions,
and in most cases also, severe inflamation of the mouth, gullet and tongue, the latter
in very many instances rotting away altogether.
For successful longevity and reproduction, therefore, it is essential for the diet to
contain all necessary vitamins as laid down by the world's leading scientists. In my
forty-seven years, besides having unparalleled practical experience in the feeding and
management of these species, I have received advice from the experts carrying out the
post mortems, plus the guidance of a practical chemist who has carried out some
one hundred various analytical and nutritional tests on my foods. I have also studied
H.M. Publications on vitamins, published by the Medical Research Council and
Lister Institutes, and Manual of Nutrition, also by H.M. Government. The published
facts cannot be challenged.
Finally, I think, that for their own benefit and the birds they keep, the breeders
should forgo the doubtful pleasure of keeping the babies preserved in spirit but send
or deliver them for post mortem to the Government Institute of Nutrition and
Experimental Breeding Station in Kent. The report on both the deaths of the babies
and the food should be published in this magazine. I am sure that their report will
support all my statements. Further, whilst it may be cotton wool that appears to have
caused the deaths, as stated, this may well be, unconsumed protein powder in a con-
glomeration probably by fermentation, a post mortem will tell.

December, 1966, number of the Magazine can be regarded as a " first ". G. A.
Petrie, Dunfermline, has bred this finch on several occasions during the past few years.
1959. November. A pair was bought from D. Salteri.
1960. July. Two young were hatched, one reared. It proved to be a cock and is still
living.
1961. June. Three young were hatched but due to a shortage of live food only one was
reared. It turned out to be partially blind.

<bodyText confidence="0.831210571428571" page_id="56379154"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
1962. Three young were hatched and as one was thrown out of the nest at five days it
was decided to allow the parents semi-liberty. The experiment proved a great
success ; the two remaining young were reared, both were hens which died in 1965.
1963. Breeding was not possible owing to the construction of a new bird-room and
aviaries.
1964. Parents at semi-liberty. Two young ones were hatched and reared, but due to
the activities of a cat on top of the aviary both sustained broken legs and died three
days later.
1965. Clear eggs laid.
1966. Both parents died while rearing three youngsters. They were then seven
years old.
Quite a number of our local club members went up to Petrie's house to see the
birds flying at liberty and coming to their owner for mealworms.

BREEDING ABILITY OF JAVA SPARROWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.871968" page_id="56379154"  page_num="105" year="" vol="">
I have just to-day read the inquiry in the Avicultural Magazine and was
intrigued by it. I have, although, never bred or even tried to breed Java Sparrows
(Padda oryzivora), however, I think I can make a few suggestions which might prove to
be useful to you.

<bodyText confidence="0.9991425" page_id="56379155"  page_num="106" year="" vol="">
I have recently become greatly interested in avian reproduction and it seems to me
that aviculturists are quite ignorant of the phase of aviculture dealing with the
mechanisms which cause sexual stimulation. Birds of the temperate zone (to which
most birds bred in captivity are native) many times make use of the photoperiodicity
factor (length of daylight) to stimulate the hypothalamus which eventually stimulates
the gonads. Since the length of daylight near the equator is nearly the same all the year
round, the birds found there (as is the Java Sparrow) have to have some other stimuli
both internal and external to induce them to breed. As in so many strictly tropical
birds, Javas make use of another important factor and that is periodic rainy seasons.
So, I feel that by simulating rainfall, by the use of a sprinkler system, in an indoors,
controlled aviary, it would be quite simple to breed Java Sparrows. Gradually stop
the daily " rain " and provide paddy-rice. This might depict the concentration of
seeds, grain, and insects in their wild state after the rainy season. This might seem
complicated, but I think it is the best and most reliable procedure to enable you to
build up a breeding stock from wild-trapped sparrows.
You might wonder how the Japanese are able to breed Javas. Correct me if I am
wrong, but I am sure that Japan has periodic rainfall much like in south-east Asia.

Things you shouSd know about this food
As will be seen by the above composition of ingredients, this food is a COMPLETELY
NUTRITIONAL FOOD in every respect and practically impossible to be improved by
any addition. It has transpired in various talks our Principal has had with
Humming Bird fanciers, that many add honey, vitamin C syrup, abidec and similar
concentrates, with the mistaken idea they are improving the food. THIS IS NOT SO,
any such additive will unbalance the proven formula and is likely to do more harm than
possible good.
Whilst Stimulite Nectar Food was originally produced for Humming Birds and
Nectarines in general, it is such a complete nutritional food that its range of uses cover
the whole of the animal and bird kingdom. It has many advantages, sick animals who
will normally refuse solid or semi-solid food, will drink nectar with relish, mainly
because of its complete absence of fat-intolerance and its palatability. It will wholly
sustain and build to complete health animals or birds in its entirety, promoting in the
process, a healthy, free from disease, skin, fur or feather.
Most Humming Bird fanciers like to give a fresh or a change of food in the afternoon
or evening; this is a good practice and we have now developed a special ready to mix
food for this purpose, which we have used for many years on our own stocks.
This will be known as

A pair of malevolent yellow eyes staring balefully from the dark
recesses of a cardboard box, and a rattling hiss, much like that of a
rattle-snake, was my introduction to the Burrowing Owl.
Arriving as an unwanted part of a live animal shipment to the
Natural History Museum at which I am employed, the frightened bird
was destined to be returned to the animal dealer ; another long,
tedious journey. Gallantly stepping in, I snatched the little owl from
the returning ordeal of baggage car and mail truck and took him home,
so beginning a friendship with this species lasting to this day. I now
have a pair of these delightful creatures which tenant a glass-fronted
cage complete with artificial burrow, and fly from picture frame to
lamp-shade in the evenings, when I am at home to clean up after them.
The Burrowing Owl exists in two distinct races, one residing in
Florida, the other in the western portion of the country and down into
South America. The species is decidedly diurnal in habit, preferred
hunting times though being dawn and dusk. It is next to impossible to
mistake one of these little critters for anything else, what with their
small round forms and long legs (for an owl), and their amusing habit
of bobbing and bowing, while directing a stream of owl profanities at
the source of aggravation. They are confirmed hole nesters, but prefer
holes in the ground, hence their name. In the west, they often strong-
arm prairie-dog burrows from their rightful owners, but in the South
they are usually forced to do their own digging, quite a feat for an
owl 9 inches long.
But what the Burrowing Owl lacks in size, he admirably makes up
in temper and just plain guts. They have been known to take birds
nearly as large as they are, and are vigorous defenders of the hearth and
home (or is it hole ?).
Almost invariably selecting flat, treeless savannah and grasslands to
set up housekeeping, the " Ground ", or " Billy Owl ", as he is often

called, is most often seen flying off close to the ground at one's approach
and alighting on a rise in the terrain or a fence post from which to
berate the intruder.
In spite of all his spunk and designs for getting along in life, the
Burrowing Owl is fighting an uphill battle for survival, particularly
in Florida. Here, the intensive development going on in that State,
plus the irresponsible element among hunters, has driven the little owl
out of areas in which the sight of one was once commonplace. In the
West, on the other hand, the bird suffers severe losses as a result of
poisoning campaigns aimed at prairie dogs, among which the owls live.
One Caribbean island race of the species is already extinct, a victim of
introduced rats.
My own birds have, to date, resisted efforts to breed them, but none
the less display most of the traits and habits the species is reported to
possess. As mentioned previously, my pair are allowed the freedom of
my studio in the evening, and it is at this time that their normal
behaviour activities may be observed. However, having only observed
these owls under captive conditions, I cannot say just how much their
activities are curtailed or regulated by cage life.
The plumages are in somewhat less than satisfactory condition due
to the inevitable abrasion with the cage walls, although " hunger
streaks " or splits are non-existent. Bills and talons must be trimmed
and clipped periodically, and I do not use sand as an absorbent as
I had found abrasions and open sores on the foot soles until its use
was discontinued. I find that any good commercial cat-litter works
well, in addition to having a good deodorizing effect.
In my own experience with owls (this includes a South American
Striped Owl, Screech, and a Longear I have at present) I have found
that allowing the birds a full feed or " gorge " and then alternately
decreasing the amount fed, allowing them to become " sharp set ",
is beneficial, by and large. Natural sunlight is available to them,
vitamins are given at regular intervals, and mealworms are fed on
occasion to provide proteins and diet variation.
Although the birds have used the artificial burrow provided (as
evidenced by droppings and pellets in the nest cavity), they have not
shown any definite inclinations to breed. As one of the pair appears to
be a bit larger, I have assumed this to be the hen. But I have heard
that size is not a factor in sexing these owls, hence, if any member has
worked with this species and is acquainted with a method for sexing them
I would be most grateful to learn of it.
The Burrowing Owl is an extremely agile flier, hovering like a
Kestrel over an object of interest. They are extremely curious creatures,
poking and prying in and around furniture. Considering all their
amusing traits, and their questionable status and future in the wild
state, I would think that successful breedings would be both enjoyable

to record and worth while conservation-wise. Their future, some day,
may be up to breeders working with captive-bred birds.
Whatever future awaits him in this over-developed, overcrowded
world of ours, the Burrowing Owl will continue to coo and bob from
any handy fence-post, as long as there are prairies to hunt over. He
will pursue the insect and rodent hordes as long as there are those
among men who will protect him, appreciate him, and let him live in
peace.

(Colibri coruscans )
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey)
In my notes on " Near Misses with Violet-eared Hummingbirds "
(Avicultural Magazine, Nov.-Dee., 1966) I mentioned on p. 166
that I was thinking of putting the cock in the adjacent flight-shelter to
that occupied by the hen and keep them separate for the winter and
then try and pair them up again in the spring. This was done but as
was the case last year, the birds in their respective side by side
aviaries, came into breeding condition late in the very mild winter
which we had.
On 28th February, 1967, there were signs of nest-building 5 feet
high on the netting of the hen's shelter facing the pop-hole to the flight.
By the next day a cascade of cotton wool, kapok and grasses was falling
to the floor as fast as the hen put it up. She was in a great hurry and
trying to string up her nest on the netting itself, an almost impossible
task, so little progress was made. I then opened a division between
the two shelters and thus allowed the cock and hen freedom to enter
each other's shelters and flights. On 5th March it was obvious that
she would never complete the nest without help. She seemed exhausted
and the floor was littered with teased-out nesting material which had
fallen. The cock was again separated and knowing that nothing
would make the hen change her mind on the choice of nesting site,
my husband and I fitted a small cedar support under the nesting
material still hanging from the netting. By the next day there were
signs that she was attaching her nest to the netting and platform in
much the same way that she did last year when she was in the cock's
aviary. On that occasion she rested the nest on the aviary framing--
this time she was 12 inches above it.
Progress was slow, but the hen seemed stronger so on 8th March we
again removed the division and let the cock enter her aviary. Two
more days went by and the nest was still unfinished. On the 10th we
again closed the division and re-opened it on the 12th and by 15th

IIO K. M. SCAMELL-BREEDING THE VIOLET-EARED HUMMINGBIRD
March the nest appeared to be complete. The next day she spent
most of the day perching low down in the flight which was most
unusual. She did not look too fit so once again the division was shut
and the two birds separated ! The next day there was an egg in the
nest so the division was opened once more. At 6 p.m. she was incu-
bating with the male hovering quietly in the same shelter--the most
peaceful scene we had witnessed for many days ! It was not until the
morning of 20th March that she laid her second egg when we again
closed the division and shut the cock in his own aviary.
During the next three days, nectar consumption in the hen's
aviary remained high, a full tube (o- 7 fl. oz.) each day. It seemed that
the cock was distracting her from her incubation duties with his close
presence and continuous calling so, on 24th March, we caught him
up and removed him to another aviary about 30 feet away. He started
moulting shortly afterwards and ceased to call. Throughout the
incubation period the pop-hole door was left open in the daytime and
the hen was free to exercise in the flight. She seemed to spend some
time there in the late afternoons. On 28th March one egg had dis-
appeared, but the remaining egg had darkened and seemed fertile.
On 4th April at 8 a.m. when the pop-hole door was opened the hen
flew straight out into the flight. It was an opportunity for my husband
and me to see if the egg had hatched. On this occasion we saw an
almost black chick wriggling in the botton half of the shell--the upper
half was missing possibly just taken into the flight by the hen. We
did not linger but it was a sight not easily forgotten. This was the 16th
day since the second egg was laid so the first egg must have been infer-
tile or chilled during the three days between the laying of the two
eggs, when she sat only occasionally. There were plenty of fruit-flies
in the shelter but we added 20 lb. of bananas to a large box of over-
ripe fruit which had been in the shelter for over a year. It had supplied
fruit-flies throughout the winter as it was near an oil-filled electric
radiator and thus got sufficient local heat. Now to make sure of a more
rapid production of these flies we wrapped the box around with
horticultural heating tape as last year and this increased the local
heat. The problem was to supply local heat to the fruit-fly culture
and at the same time to keep the bird-room temperature down as I
was quite sure there would be no hope of rearing the young bird if the
room got too warm. We kept the fruit-box covered up and removed the
covers each time either of us visited this bird-room. There were other
birds in the same room, our old Rothschild's Grackles on two eggs, a
Paradise Flycatcher and pairs of Bulbuls and Grey-headed Thrushes
and some odd softbills. As last year, all the birds in cages were quietly
removed and placed in their summer aviaries leaving the Grackles,
Bulbuls and the Paradise Flycatcher, all of which had access to out-
side flights.

K. M. SGAMELL-BREEDING THE VIOLET-EARED HUMMINGBIRD III
For the next few days everything proceeded normally--we opened
the pop-hole door each day regardless of the weather (the nest was
only about 3 feet from the pop-hole) and we had some very chilly days
with maximums around 45 0 F. With such temperatures in the shelter
all day and night we were tempted to raise the thermostat, but decided
against altering anything as the chick was very active and growing
fast. Nectar consumption was higher than last year. On nth April,
when the bird was seven days old it was as large as last years chicks at
thirteen to fourteen days when they died. This we knew as we had
preserved last years chicks in spirit and were able to make a rough
comparison for size. It was a delight to see the young bird throw its
head up over the top of the nest--at times we thought it was going to
fall out. When feeding, the hen always alights on the edge of the nest
before thrusting its beak down the chick's throat.
Diary entries for the next few days read :--
" 12th and 13th April. Cold days with bitter winds. Maximum
temperatures still around 45 0 F. Young bird almost stands up to
gape. Some quills appearing on the back and wings.
15th April. Weather fine and sunny, maximum temp. 6o*-62* F.
Young hummer growing feathers. In the late afternoon it was lying
partly on its side with swollen, dark crop clearly visible. Jet black
excreta patches which surround the nest show that ample fruit-flies
are available."
I should mention that this particular birdroom is ventilated through
the door (when open) and the five pop-holes leading to the five
outdoor flights. Twelve fixed roof lights and two fixed windows let in
light and sunshine, but on a sunny day it can get very hot inside even
with the door open. We painted six of the roof lights white but on
17th April following a cold night the temperature inside the shelter
was approaching 8o* F. at 2 p.m. The young bird looked distressed
and I thought we were going to lose it. The other six roof lights were
painted out and the temperature quickly dropped. The room was now
very gloomy as we also shut the door to keep out the sun. Artificial
lighting was necessary in the daytime and from 5 a.m. and we had no
further cause to worry over excessive heat.
The next day, 18th April, was much cooler--a big drop in tempera-
ture and sunshine. The eyes of the chick were now quite noticeable
and it was sprouting feathers all over--it was very active. All went
well for some days and on 22nd April I noted that almost two tubes of
nectar were consumed in the twenty-four hours by the hen and chick
as against one and a half tubes by the cock. The hen rarely brooded
in the daytime. The weather continued cold and often wet with
maximum temperatures ranging between 45 0 and 50* F. By 26th
April the young bird was able to move around its nest and flap its long
quilly wings. In the artificial light it appeared quite dark in colour

with a beak J inch long, black except for a light coloured base. The
hen continued to brood at night. On the 28th it was noticeable that
complete feathering had continued down the head and back and
wings, the latter almost to the tips which were now finishing. By
30th April, when the bird was twenty-seven days old, feathering was
complete except for one primary feather on each wing. The tail was
about J inch long.
I was getting quite concerned at the long time the bird was in the
nest and wondered if it would ever fly ! All my reference books
stressed, however, that not only was the incubation period remarkably
long and variable, i.e. between fourteen and nineteen days, but as the
birds must fly strongly from the moment they leave the nest, the
rearing period could be from nineteen to thirty days.
2nd May was another cold day with sleet, rain, little sunshine and
a maximum temperature of 48* F. The young bird was moving around
the nest and changing its position every few minutes and we felt that it
would not be long now before it was airborne ! The hen seemed to
spend most of the day in the flight and as the afternoon went by, it
seemed to us that something was wrong. Nectar consumption was
very low, about half normal for the time of the day. The young bird
had become inactive and seemed soft and very flat in the nest. In the
evening the mother was brooding the young bird much earlier than
usual, sitting crosswise across its back. At 7.45 p.m. it was very weak
and opening its beak at intervals. The hen came off for a moment to
feed and we had a closer look. The young bird was torpid, or almost so,
and though I tried to move it to see if it could be hand fed, its feet
were firmly gripping the nesting material, so we left it where it was.
It made the faint squeak that torpid hummers make if one tries to
move them in that condition. The hen brooded again almost at once,
but at 8.25 p.m. when we switched the light off, nectar consumption
for the two birds was three-fifths of a tube as against nine-tenths of a
tube by the cock. Torpidity in hummers is always alarming to witness,
but in our experience and from all accounts is natural in hummers
under certain conditions. Our longest lived hummer, a Greenfly
(Chlorostilbon gibsoni) went torpid most nights for nearly seven years.
What worried us, however, was the low nectar consumption and the
possibility that when the young bird came round it might be too weak
to gape for food.
I did not expect the young bird to be alive when I opened the aviary
the next morning but to my astonishment and relief it was sitting up
as perky as ever ! Several times during the day I observed it fluttering
around the nest and exercising its wings but, as far as I could see, it
had not left the nest. The weather was still cold so in the afternoon,
for the first time I shut the hen in the shelter with the young bird to
make sure that the latter did not become chilled between feeds as I

K. M. SCAMELL-BREEDING THE VIOLET-EARED HUMMINGBIRD I 1 3
think was the case the previous day. When the bird was younger it
was sheltered from winds by the sides of the nest but now it was so
large that most of its body was visible above the nest and, facing the
pop-hole as it did, there was no protection from the cold winds.
I was glad I had shut the hen inside because that night there was a
moderate frost of at least 7 degrees. The nectar in some of the sun-
birds' aviaries was frozen solid as was the water in many of the aviaries.
Our azaleas and many of the fruit trees caught this frost and were
spoilt for flowering or fruit this year.
On 4th May it rained all day. At 8 a.m. the young hummingbird
was sitting in the nest--at 10 a.m. when fresh nectar was brought in,
it was sitting on a nearby perch side by side with its mother ! We
only let the hen in the flight for a few short periods during the day in
case the young bird got out and possibly drowned. Several times we
saw it perched quite still, with its head inclined towards its parent.
At 3.30 p.m. it was back on the nest. It had flown at thirty-one days
old.
My diary for the next few days reads :--
" 5th May. Young hummer on the nest at 8 a.m., perching at
10 a.m. then flew strongly round the shelter returning to the same
perch. In the nest at 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., off about 3 p.m. until
about 6 p.m. then on the nest again. Occasionally let the hen in
the flight.
6th May. A nice day at long last. No rain and temp, about 55 0 F.
with sunshine. Let the hen in the flight at 10 a.m., the young
hummer followed her for the first time. We kept a very careful eye
on it, but very soon it went in and out of the shelter at will until
5 p.m. when it returned to its nest and stayed there. The flight of
the bird has to be seen to be believed, no faltering or hesitation and
with a perfect sense of direction. The mother got excited at times.
There are a few blue feathers developing on the chest and also two
central blue tail feathers, otherwise in sunlight it is dull blue-green
generally, without metallic effect. Nectar consumption in the
twenty-four hours : cock one and two-fifths tube, hen and young
bird one and nine-tenths tube.
7th, 8th and 9th May. Managed to get a few snaps and a few
feet of 8 mm. film showing the hen feeding the young bird. This
always occurs on a branch--the birds perching side by side with the
young bird opening its beak until the mother plunges its own beak
down the birds throat. Feeding took place at roughly half-hour
intervals, but as we were watching it may well be that the demands
to be fed would have been satisfied earlier in our absence. The
mother chased her offspring inside from time to time and by
9th May more colour was noticeable. It still retired to its nest at
dusk, the hen perching a few inches away. She no longer broods.

10th May. We saw the young bird feed itself from a tube poked
through the netting. It was a short drink taken on the wing but on
other occasions it clung to the netting to drink."
It was very hot on nth May, about 75 0 F. The mother was observed
to feed the young bird from time to time and it was also seen feeding
itself. The tail and shoulders now show iridescence. It revelled in the
thundery rains of the next day and at 8 p.m. was back on the nest
with the mother perching close by as usual. 13th May opened dull
and then warm and sunny. From 2.15 p.m. to 2.45 p.m. we both
tried to film and snap the feeding operation, but not once in that time
did its parents try to feed it. She seemed to drive it from the nectar
tube in the flight every time the young bird took a short sip on the
wing ; they also sparred a little. Several non-birdy visitors arrived
unexpectedly and our attention was diverted for some considerable
time. At 7.20 p.m. we saw the young bird clinging to the netting in the
shelter with a very excited mother charging around uttering angry
noises. After some difficulty we separated the two and with the hen
shut in the shelter netted a very frightened young bird in the flight
and caged it in the lounge. It was midnight before we were satisfied
that the bird could find the nectar and had settled down in the confines
of a cage after the freedom of a comparatively large aviary. It was a
near thing and I am quite sure the mother would have killed her
youngster by the morning. We have seen this thing happen so often,
some birds such as Diamond Doves and Rothschild's Grackles will kill
their offspring unless they are removed in time, others will go on feeding
them for weeks. It depends a lot on whether the parents want to go to
nest again.
The next day, Sunday, 14th May, we transferred the young hummer
to an empty compartment in our conservatory where we keep about
twenty hummers. It soon found the nectar and drank a full tube in
the twenty-four hours. The following day we opened the pop-hole in the
compartment and let the bird into a planted flight measuring
10 by 4 by 7 feet 6 inches high which at the time of writing, 12th June,
it has occupied alone. We have so far shut it into the shelter each
night, but there is really no need to do so. It is hardy and powerful
on the wing and enjoys the rain regardless of the downpour and we
have had many almost tropical storms during May.
On 14th May we again returned the cock to the hen's aviary and on
19th May she laid another egg in her old nest which she had cleaned
up and rebuilt. On 22nd May she laid a second egg about 3.30 p.m.
We shut the division between the two shelters and the short honey-
moon was over ! We then removed the male to his remote aviary
and the hen commenced incubating. Somehow, I did not think any-
thing would materialize. She has behaved very strangely. First she
located the eggs as far apart as possible, about ij inches from each

other. Then she sat with her beak protruding through the netting
and looked most uncomfortable. On 24th May one egg disap-
peared only to reappear two days later. On 28th May no eggs were
visible at all yet she sat all day ! A careful look when she was off the
nest showed she had buried the eggs beneath the nesting material and
the nest itself was twice as thick as it was a few days earlier. She
finally gave up incubation on 6th June and we again returned the
cock who has completed his moult and is now in wonderful condition
and feather. The birds are not shut in at night and I thought I saw
a glimpse of her through the pop-hole at dusk this evening, sitting once
more on her rebuilt nest. I have still hopes of another clutch of eggs
this year anyway, provided she does not go into moult. The young
bird is developing more iridescence, but I do not think this will be
complete until it has had its first moult. As regards sex, it is possible
it is a female as a batchelor hummer in the next aviary is paying it
a lot of attention ! The nectar recipe is exactly the same as the one
I used last year, i.e. Gevral-Protein-Vitamin food plus sugar and water
in the proportions I mentioned in my previous notes.
As described, Mrs. Scamell has bred the Violet-eared Humming-
bird (Colibri coruscans ). It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDINGS AT THE EDWARD
MARSHALL BOEHM AVIARIES IN 1966
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994772975609756" page_id="56379177"  page_num="116" year="" vol="">
By Edward Marshall Boehm (Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A.)
I am pleased to relate some of the interesting breedings we have
accomplished at the Edward Marshall Boehm Aviaries in 1966. First,
I will mention, collectively, breedings which I think have not been
accomplished heretofore, and I use the word " think " advisedly,
because I have no definite way of confirming this.
Came first the breeding of the Princess Stephanie's Bird of Paradise
[Astrarchia stephaniae). Next, and perhaps the greatest thrill, came the
Ribbon-tailed Bird of Paradise ( Taenia paradisea mayeri), followed by
successes with the Golden-vented Bulbul ( Pycnonotus goiavier person ),
Schalow's Touraco (Touraco schalowi), Striated Tanager (Thraupis
bonariensis) , and Amethyst Sunbird ( Chalcomitra amethystina ).
The following do not have the glamour of first successes, but are
equally interesting. The Magnificent Bird of Paradise ( Diphyllodes
magnified) now has five broods, totalling seven youngsters, and is, at
present, residing over two eggs.
A revelation was the latest breeding of the Imperial Fruit Pigeon.
The youngster of 1965 was permitted to stay with the parents. The
parents nested again in the early spring of 1966, and after the hen had
raised her first brood, the youngster of 1965 (which proved to be a
female), proceeded to take over the abandoned nest. After fertilization
of her egg by her sire, she hatched and reared her youngling, without
any paternal help. The new youngster now has fledged and is perfectly
normal in every visual aspect. As I write this, on 10th February, 1967,
the original pair again has a youngster in the very same nest.
In the case of the Stephanie's and the Ribbon-tailed Birds of
Paradise, hatching time was twenty-one days. Time in the nest varied
from twenty-two to twenty-six days. In all nestings of the Stephanie's
and Ribbon-tailed Birds of Paradise, only one egg was laid.
Continued observation points up the lack of inclination of Birds of
Paradise to mate when the individuals have been paired together for
an extended period of time. New males, or the same male, introduced
just prior to the finishing of the nest, are accepted for mating and
copulation quite readily, often instantaneously.
The pre-copulation ceremonies of the Stephanie are quite vigorous
and brutal ; they grasp one another with their talons, usually in the
thighs, or in whatever manner chance may present. At times, it
actually becomes " mortal combat ", and I say this factually, because
I have had hens kill glorious males. I do not wish to conjecture on how
often death occurs, but we have lost two beautiful males in this manner,
and I have been an observer of this combat on eight occasions. I have

also seen a pair, in the throes of battle, fall into a pond of water. The
birds would have drowned had they not been rescued. In all cases,
their grasp on one another is so intent they fall to the ground ; and
they attack one another with their beaks. When the female is over-
powered and becomes submissive, they will then fly to a convenient
branch where he will crest his hood and shield in a display of colour
that is breathtaking ! At the culmination of this display, copulation
ensues.
Paradisea minor and Paradisea raggiana will display to each other, as
well as to like species. Male displays are confined almost entirely to
early morning or late evening activity. Of great interest is discovery
of the fact that in the displays of Paradisea minor and Paradisea raggiana ,
the females take part, even when separated from the males. I have
observed, day after day, the females displaying to one another in their
abodes, or a female displaying to a male in view in an adjoining aviary.
Male and female would cling to the wire separating the aviaries, or
perch on branches as near to each other as could be achieved ;
dictated, of course, by the growth of the trees in their respective
confines. The female repeats the ritual of the male, who rhythmically
and spherically umbrages his wings with a pulsation that carries no
definable metre. He sends his plumes into a cascade so reminiscent of
a waterfall. The female calls out as does the male, but in a much lower
key, like the whining of a puppy ; perhaps the begging of a fledgling
for food would describe it better.
The females often display among themselves while the males are at
rest. Their displays are of longer duration and shorter intervals than
those of the males. My observations have not connected these displays
with the nesting act, as I have had only one go to nest (Paradisea
minor) and that was before I had pairs opposite to one another. I
wonder if these complex displays are entirely a sexual attraction, or,
rather, occasionally for amusement or play acting.
The Amethyst was our third success with Sunbirds, having bred the
Scarlet-chested seven years ago, and the Golden-winged three years
ago (although the young did not survive thirty days). We seem to have
the greatest success in introducing sunbirds to nest by starting a woven
cocoon-like nest with heavy cord, weaving fine grasses between the
meshes and then lining the inside with cotton. We hang the nest on
the very tip of a tree branch. We then place in conspicuous places
capok, wool, and dog hair for their choice. Horse-hair is occasionally
used, but never before cutting it into rather short lengths, as the long
lengths can entwine their legs and wings, or enmesh them enough to
hang themselves or make them vulnerable to attacks by other birds.
Eighteen days comprised the incubation period of the Amethyst
Sunbird, twenty-one days the nest abode. The hen administered food
entirely during the nest period ; however, the cock fed after the

youngster had fledged. Ten days after the fledgling left the nest, the
female re-laid and raised a subsequent chick--no animosity was j
displayed to the first chick by either parent after the arrival of the
second chick.
The Striated Tanager raised two broods in 1966. These consisted
of two in the first nest and one in the second. Two eggs were laid each :
time. Nest construction was similar to that of our Wood Thrush j
(.Hylocichla mustelina ), and was built in the very top of a white pine, j
22 feet tall. The entire nest was of their own construction, and both
male and female fed the young. At this writing, there seem to be two
females and a male. Although the male has not yet come into mature 1
colour (seven months of age), he is showing the colour patterns of a j
mature male, but in various shades of grey. The grey of the breast in
the young male has a slight yellow-olive tint, indicating the brighter
hue to come.
We have now a very comprehensive collection of New Guinea birds, !
consisting of pairs of Paradisea minor , Paradisea raggiana , Bluebird,
Superb, Carol's, King's, Stephanie's, Ribbon-tailed, Sickle-bills, j
Magnificents, Orange-crested Bower Birds, Mackelot's Pitta, Hooded
Pitta, Double-eyed Fig Parrots, Stella's Lorikeets--we have success- !
fully reared the young of four species.
I should like to proffer an opinion concerning often-written articles |
about parents maliciously destroying their young, or casting them from
the nest. The theory that malice prompts these actions is fallacious.
I have occasionally seen it happen in our aviaries, but in each case, it I
was because the parents could not secure enough live food, particularly 1
in the first one or two days of the chick's life. I know that many will
say, " Well, I supplied this or that type of live food ! " However, the
questions to pose are : Was it of small enough size to suit the parent or
parents ? Were there other birds in the same aviary who might have
depleted the supply before the parents could gather enough for the
chicks, and before the attendant had returned with a fresh supply ? i
Given a sufficient supply of live food, was there some environmental
reason why the parents did not supply enough of it to the
youngster ?
I think few of us realize how many insects actually are fed in the
course of a day. We know from experience it runs into hundreds per
young. Many frugivorous, omnivorous, and seed-eating birds will not !
feed other than live insects until the young have left the nest or are
well on their way to leaving it.
This is why I think many parents are unjustly accused of destroying j
their young. What they actually are doing, in my opinion, is removing
the corpses from their nests preparatory to starting new nesting
operations. I saw this happen recently when our female Amethyst
raised two broods, the third being well into October. The chick was

fifteen days old at the time, and we experienced a rather extended
spell of rain. Food offerings were more than adequate, and the " black
lights 55 were left on at night as usual. However, one has only to
surmise that due to the rain falling, crepusculous, or night-flying
insects, were not in their usual prevalence. Consequently, the chick
died before the end of the second day. The parent removed the chick,
but not before trying, in vain, to feed it throughout the afternoon on
which it died.
It has been found here that the young among all types of birds
raised in captivity are subject to rickets. Evidently the condition is
brought about by the unavailability of insects containing chitinous or
exoskeletal formation. We experienced it in starlings, touracos,
tanagers, fairy bluebirds, etc. The parents will raise the young so
affected ; however, they are crippled for life and are best put down, as
they can neither perch nor fly. Experiments were carried out in one
case to see how long the parent would feed the affected youngster that
could not leave the nest area. Feeding was carried out over a longer
period than with the normal chick who went on to fend for itself.
We have developed a positive preventive of rickets. Though simple
in administration, it is, as far as I have been able to determine, ioo per
cent effective. Preventive measures consist of taking a few drops of
tasteless cod liver oil and rubbing them between the palms of the hands.
Mealworms are then taken and similarly rubbed to give them a slight
coating of cod liver oil. Care must be exercised not to overdo the oil
application, as it apparently inhibits the breathing mechanism of the
worms. This causes asphyxiation, and the birds are disinterested when
the worms display no movement. A mixture of 75 per cent calcium
carbonate, and 25 per cent steamed bone meal is prepared and placed
in a large commercial-type salt shaker and kept at hand. After the
application of the oil to the insects, they are dusted lightly with the
above mixture. When the food is placed for the morning feeding,
the shaker is carried along and a slight sprinkling applied directly to
the food of that particular aviary. This method is essential and
beneficial. When the mixture previously had been mixed into the bulk
food formula, there were no visible beneficial results. Whether the
calcium is lost by being absorbed by the fruit and food juices, I cannot
yet determine. I do know, however, that if the direct application of
the calcium is neglected on the insects or foods of that aviary where the
young is reared, we will experience rickets in the young.
The Schalow's Touraco reared two broods, although the first had to
be destroyed because of rickets. The last brood came well into frost
time, and before they were caught up to be placed in heated aviaries
(the young at this time not being totally feathered), they were exposed
to below-freezing temperatures, seemingly without any adverse effects.
The parents did not seem to suffer any adverse effects either. The

incubation period was the same as for all touracos, as was the length I
of stay in the nest.
The Schalow's make a much more elaborate nest than has been
observed in other touraco species we have had. The nest is more
"jay-like " in its construction. Not having experienced nesting!
preparations of all touraco species, I cannot say definitely that this is
characteristic only of Schalow's.
Our " old faithfuls ", the Fairy Wrens, Fairy Bluebirds, Natal Robin,
and others previously reported, continue to be prolific. Most have
raised two to three broods for the fourth consecutive year, and they :
are responsible for providing specimens to the San Diego, Washington, :
Cleveland, New York, and Brookfield Zoos. This tends to prove a
long-held contention of the writer that a national or international
aviary or aviaries could be established to propagate rare species and
species in danger of extinction. Its feasibility would depend entirely
on the people behind it--more definitely, on the men directly respon-
sible for its every-day function.
I would suggest that all aviculturists give serious thought to such a
possibility and, after a site were chosen and obtained, it could be built j
and maintained by an assessment to each zoological society in keeping i
with their available funds. Perhaps it could reach a status where
government funds would be available for its use. I feel sure many
pharmaceutical laboratories might be inclined to help support it, as it
could well prove beneficial to their research programmes. Possibly l
some of the large foundations could lend support.
As the population continues to explode, there seems little doubt that
flower and fauna will be taxed to their limits for survival. Will Rogers
once said so aptly, on being asked what he liked most to invest his
money in, " Real estate, 'cause that's one thing they 'aint ' making
any more of."
I expect to be in England some time in the coming year, when I will
endeavour to meet as many aviculturists as time and occasion permit.
If arrangements can be made at one of the meetings of the Avicultural
Society, I should very much like to present a rather fascinating film.
It has taken some months to prepare and bring to culmination. It will
possess both sound and colour and will be made available for use by
any Avicultural Society which desires to view it. It will show many
first breedings and the various modes of parental care bestowed on the
young by different species. Included will be incredibly beautiful
displays by various species of the Birds of Paradise.
I should like, at this writing, to extend to all aviculturists interested
in the propagation of birds, an invitation to visit the Boehm Aviaries,
where appointments will be established by letter or phone. Some time
in the near future, I will attempt an article on the relativity of area as a
stimulus to birds to nest.

Report from Dr. D. Hey, Director of Nature Conservation, Cape of
Good Hope, South Africa. As narrated by R. Horsham
Towards the end of 1956 we received a consignment of Red-cheeked
Lovebirds which had been confiscated at the Cape Town docks as
they were being imported without the necessary permits. There
were more than sixty birds in a small box and only thirty-three were
still alive, and these survivors were released into an aviary of
approximately 20 by 6 by 8 feet at Jonkershoek. It was only after the
birds were placed in this aviary we realized that both wings had been
severely clipped and the result was that the birds clambered to the roof
of the aviary and hung there. When startled they would release their
hold and endeavour to fly, but being unable to do so, dropped to the
ground, and in this way many were severely injured and of the total
number only twelve ultimately survived.
A research project was being undertaken at the time, of the breeding
of parrots and lovebirds in captivity and consequently it was considered
of interest to try to breed these Red-cheeked Lovebirds. We could
find only one account of this being done in captivity for which purpose
bales of peat were used. The first veterinary project was to tame the
birds somewhat and to improve their general condition by adequate
feeding. Among the twelve survivors there were five pairs. These
were presented with a wide variety of material including bales of moss
and chaff, wooden nesting-boxes of various design, hollow logs, and
bundles of rushes. The birds showed no sign of interest whatsoever in
the nests. Eventually Dr. David Davies (the late Professor Davies)
suggested we try providing them with a termite nest. Four old termite
nests were then mounted one on top of each other and cemented
together with clay, thus giving a mound of about 4 feet high and
18 inches in diameter.
Holes of approximately 2 inches in diameter were drilled into this
structure. This nest was placed in the aviary in the spring of 1958 and
by the middle of summer mating was observed among the Lovebirds.
Towards the end of summer one pair occupied one of the tunnels in
this termite nest and three young emerged in May, 1959.
In the Avicultural Magazine, 1959, page 119, John Perry
describes the nesting of a pair of Red-faced Lovebirds in the aviaries
of David Dale, Cape Town ; five young left this nest on 30th May to
14th June, 1959, and were fully reared. These events must have been
only a matter of days after Dr. Hey's success.-- Ed.

By Ralph C. Small (Parrot Keeper, Chicago Zoological Park,
Brookfield, Illinois, 60513, U.S.A.)
On 20th June, 1966, the first Darwin's Rhea chick to live was hatched
in an incubator. Four were hatched altogether. Two died of
pneumonia at a few days of age. The third one drowned at forty-seven
days. The fourth one lived, and is now nine months old.
It was decided to bring the chick to the Parrot House. The chick was
placed in a wire-bottomed cage, 5 by 5 feet. A duckling was placed
in the cage to keep it company and help teach it to eat. A heat lamp
was placed over it to keep the temperature at about 95 degrees. The
heat lamp was gradually raised to lower heat until it was no longer
needed.
The chick did not start to eat until the second day. The formula fed
was as follows :--
f gallon chopped escarole.

In the drinking water was placed o-6 cc. Vi-Syneral to 1 pint of
water.
The duckling was taken away at fourteen days. At this time, the
chick was placed in a corner on sand. Crickets were given when
obtainable, but the chick did not seem to care too much for them.
The chick grew very fast.
At two months of age, the heat lamp was turned off. The baby
enjoyed the heat lamp and would sit under it even though the building
was quite warm.
At three months, the baby was moved to the Antelope House where
it had a whole cage to itself. Now at nine months it is almost full
grown. This Darwin's Rhea is believed to be the first one ever raised
in the United States.
I believe that it would be easier to raise Darwin's Rhea chicks if
they could be let out to graze in the open air and given the above diet.
They would have to be kept from getting wet and then kept warm

THE WHITE-BREASTED MUTATION OF THE
GOULDIAN FINCH
</sectionHeader>

By F. Barnicoat (Johannesburg, Transvaal, South Africa)
For more than ten years I have derived endless pleasure from line-
breeding Gouldian Finches. It has been possible to ring dozens of
young Gouldians with closed aluminium Zebra Finch rings without
resulting in a single loss. The keeping of detailed records of all
parentages, only possible because I keep one, or at most two pairs to
an aviary, has been a labour I have never regretted, the steady
improvement of my stock being the chief reward. Over the past two
years, however, the wonderful task and challenge, granted seldom if
ever to an aviculturist, of establishing a new mutation has fortunately
come my way. News of this mutation of the Gouldian Finch will
surely be of interest in avicultural circles throughout the world.
In January, 1965, two white-breasted Gouldian cocks were sold to a
leading Johannesburg pet shop. Both were red-headed and were
perfectly normal Gouldians except that the entire purple breast was
replaced by the purest and most striking white imaginable. Many
mutant birds have at first proved rather inferior in physique, but these
lacked neither size nor vigour and all their other colours were quite as
brilliant as those of a normal Gouldian. Even the turquoise necklace
was very prominent, and, now against the white instead of purple
chest, showed up in a particularly striking way. I was asked by the
manager of the pet shop to attempt to breed a stock of these Gouldians
to avoid their being sold into possibly inexperienced hands. The task
was eagerly accepted.
The first question was whether this was a genuine mutation and
whether these cocks could ultimately reproduce their kind. Of this I
was almost certain, because for several years I had heard rumours of
the existence of these birds in the Transvaal. One fancier had definitely

bred some of them, but his stock had been lost. Another fancier was
alleged to have bought Gouldians from this man and produced one
white-breasted bird, but he had gone no further. Although a class for
these birds had actually been inserted in the South African National
Cage Bird Association schedule, their continued survival was generally
doubted. It never appeared on the show bench and remained a rather
mythical bird. I do not know whether the two cocks that came to me
were remnants of the stock of the fancier who did once possess some of
these mutants, or whether they were thrown from some of the stock
dispersed by him. At present, however, I have, to the best of my
knowledge, the only ones in South Africa. A prominent Australian
authority of very wide experience does not know of any specimens of
such a mutation anywhere in Australia. Mine could be the only ones
in existence.
The fact that both white-breasted Gouldians were cocks seemed to
indicate that the mutation would not prove to be sex-linked, as hens
usually appear first and predominate in this type of mutation. The
chances were that it was a recessive inheritance and, as Gouldians take
nine months to colour and never breed until the following year, the
road would obviously be a long one.
Given to me with these cocks were two hens supposed to be related,
but they looked old and past breeding. Though very healthy, the
white-breasted cocks looked old, their feet were very scaly and both had
a missing toe. Realizing that I might not have long to experiment,
I put them in an aviary with one of the old reputed related hens and
with one of my own red-headed hens which I had proved to be an
excellent breeder.
As I expected, the related hen never looked like going to nest and
died after a few months, to be followed shortly after by the other old
related hen ; but my own good breeding hen eventually laid a
clutch of eggs. I doubted whether they would be fertile, but they were
and the white-breasted cock even proved a hard-working and
conscientious father. In April, 1965, five babies left the nest, to be
followed by another three in July.
The eight offspring moulted out into six red-headed cocks and two
black-headed hens all perfectly normal in appearance, but Gouldians
of exceptionally good quality. I wondered seriously whether they :
carried the factor at all, but the breeding programme for 1966 held
thrilling prospects none the less.
The two original white-breasted cocks escaped all the disasters that
fate often brings to one's most precious birds, and they came through
a very heavy moult, spared for another breeding season and in obviously
better condition than in the previous year. They were mated to the
two black-headed hens, which I hoped would prove splits : if so,
50 per cent of the babies should be mutants.

During 1966 ten babies were reared from the two pairs, three from
the father mated to his daughter and seven from the uncle mated to
his niece. The long wait for these babies to colour seemed never
ending, and I shall long remember the September day when I noticed
the first white breast feather in one of these youngsters and realized
that the two-year dream had become reality. Yet the final picture
proved to be even beyond my wildest hopes. No less than seven were
white-breasted, and of these four were hens (three black-headed and
one red-headed) and three were cocks (two red-headed and one black-
headed) . All are magnificent, brilliantly coloured Gouldians and have
dazzling white breasts with not one purple feather. It is a wonderful
sight to see this mutation now in the black-headed phase as well as in
the red-headed. The other three babies, which must be splits, are all
red-headed hens absolutely normal in appearance.
The early days of 1967 unfortunately saw one of the original white-
breasted cocks go the way of all flesh, and even more unlucky was the
sudden loss of one of the young hens through a night fright. Still
the prospects for further success this breeding season are good, and, if
my luck can hold again this season, the stock will be put on a sounder
footing in 1967. I am deeply grateful to my good fortune for this
tremendous boon. I like to hope that one day I may see my stock of
these gorgeous birds sweep right round the world.

By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
Countless overseas visitors to St. James's Park, London, must have
asked why Birdcage Walk is so named. In very many cases they will, of
course, have been correctly informed that here formerly were animal
and bird enclosures for the pleasure of Charles II. The collection
must have been quite extensive, but few contemporary descriptions are
readily available.
Dr. Edward Browne visited St. James's Park in February, 1664,
and writes : " I saw many strange creatures, as divers sorts of out-
landish deer, Guiny sheep, a white raven, a great parrot, a storke,
which having broke its own leg, had a wooden leg set on . . . "
John Evelyn (1620-1706), the English diarist and author, was an
acknowledged authority on several subjects, but ornithology was not
amongst his interests. He owes his celebrity mainly to his famous
Diary --a keen and discerning observer of the passing scene he recorded
his observations and impressions with meticulous care. It is perhaps
not generally known that whereas the Diary covers the period 1641 to
1705-6 it was, in fact, not discovered until 1817, in an old clothes-
basket at Evelyn's home at Wotton, Surrey.
Evelyn's entry regarding his visit to St. James's Park has often been
reproduced, almost invariably with quite a few inaccuracies. Our
copy of the Diary is dated 1819 and so may be presumed to be the true
version. It is perhaps worth quoting it verbatim.
Under the date 9th February, 1665, Evelyn writes : "I went to
St. James's Parke, where I saw various animals, and examined the
throate of y e Onocratylus or Pelican, a fowle between a Storke and a
Swan ; a melancholy water-fowl brought from Astracan by the
Russian Ambassador, it was diverting to see how he would toss up and
turn a flat fish, plaice or flounder, to get it right into its gullet at its
lower beak, w ch being filmy, stretches to a prodigious wideness
when it devours a great fish. Here was also a small water-fowl not
bigger than a more-hen, that went almost quite erect like the
penguin of America ; it would eate as much fish as its whole body
weigh'd, I never saw so unsatiable a devourer, yet y e body did not
appear to swell the bigger. The Solan geese here also are greate
devourers, and are said soon to exhaust all y e fish in a pond. Here
was a curious sort of poultry not much exceeding the size of a tame
pidgeon, with legs so short as their crops seem'd to touch y e earth ;
a milk-white raven ; a stork which was a rarity at this season, seeing he
was loose and could flie loftily ; two Balearian cranes, one of which
having had one of his leggs broken and cut off above the knee, had a
wooden or boxen leg and thigh, with a joynt so accurately made that

y e creature could walke and use it as well as if it had been natural ;
it was made by a souldier. The Parke was at this time stored with
numerous flocks of severall sorts of ordinary and extraordinary wild
fowle, breeding about the Decoy, which for being neere so greate a
Citty, and among such a concourse of souldiers and people, is a
singular and diverting thing. There were also deere of severall countries,
white ; spotted like leopards ; antelopes ; an elk ; red deere ;
roebucks ; staggs ; Guinea goates ; Arabian sheepe, &amp;c. There
were withy-potts or nests for the wild fowle to lay their eggs in, a little
above y e surface of y e water."
The Russian Ambassador presented the original pelicans to
Charles II in 1662, and it is interesting to note that John Ray (1627-
1705) was able to identify them as Grey or Dalmatian. This gift was
the start of the pelican tradition in St. James's Park.
A white Pelican is mentioned by Sir Thomas Browne as having
been shot at Horsey Fen, Norfolk, on 22nd May, 1663. Sir Thomas
was careful to note that one of the pelicans had flown away from
St. James's Park about the same time, so it may very well have been
that one.

In April I paid a visit to Jamaica. One of the wonders of Kingston
is the Hope Botanical and Zoological Gardens. I am told people visit
these gardens from all over the world. It is five and a half miles from
Kingston on the Hope Road.
The Botanical Gardens has a wonderful orchid house which one
can walk through from the main gate. There are very wide roads
with a profusion of plants and flowers through which cars may be
driven.
The Botanical Gardens has a large lake near the Zoo on which I
saw Muscovy Duck, but I believe there are one or two swans which
I did not see. They grow coffee and other agricultural plants on the

estate, as it is run by the Jamaican Government from the Ministry of
Agriculture.
The Zoo itself is in about 20 acres divided off from the Botanical
Gardens. They have a small collection of West Indian Flamingos
(.Phoenicopterus ruber ) on a small lake near the main gate. There are some
Green-winged, Red and Yellow, and Blue and Yellow Macaws on a tree
on a pond near the flamingos. They have a collection of Amazon
Parrots which consisted of a large number of Jamaican Black-billed
and Amazon Parrots, some White-eyed Amazons, Levaillant's, Green-
cheeked, also some Yellow-naped Amazons. They were in flimsy,
small aviaries and did not have any nest-boxes in which to breed.
There were also some Conures and some Parrakeets. I saw the
Red-tailed Hawk ( Buteo jamaicensis) in a small cage ; they had a pair
of Globose Curassows with them. There is an aviary with some
Jamaican and Barbary Doves provided with nest-boxes in which they
were breeding.
The Iguanas of the Cayman Islands were displayed--both the
Cayman Island and the Blue. A group of Indian Coneys or India-
geocapromys (browni ) in a small cage, very heavily barred, by the
lion's enclosure--this animal is rare. Also a pack of the Central
American Grey Fox ( Urocyon cineptorcentus) , a very rarely seen canine.
There were some Virginian Deer. Peafowl roam round the Botanical
Gardens and the Zoo and I saw a mother Peafowl feed her young with
some white bread.
The Zoo unfortunately publishes no guide-book--a great pity when
so many interesting birds and animals are in their collection.

The following birds were purchased : 4 Puna Teals, 4 Andean

The most interesting addition to our bird collection are six fine
Hooded Cranes (Grus monacha ). This rare species had already been
represented in the Berlin Zoo in pre-war times. One bird lived here
from 29th February, 1912, until 17th September, 1937, and another
one also purchased in 1912 even lived until 30th January, 1944.
Although it is not possible to determine the sex of our newcomers we
hope that some of them will breed one day. As far as we know, Hooded
Cranes are becoming rarer and rarer in the wild so that zoos should do
everything for the conservation of this species.

From Costa Rica recently we received a shipment of great interest,
the most exciting of these new arrivals being a group of Long-tailed
Manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis , which are seldom exhibited in the
British Isles. Also included were three Black-necked Stilts and a pair of
Thicknees. Other recent acquisitions are pairs of Roulrouls, Blue-
headed Rock Thrushes, Orange-breasted Fruit Pigeons and Hoopoes,
and a cock Rothschild's Grackle.
Nesting activity has commenced at last, but the first to breed--a
pair of White-capped Redstarts--lost their young when they were
several days old, apparently having been disturbed by other birds. We
are now eagerly awaiting the emergence from her box of a Red-billed
Hornbill, sealed in by the cock seven days ago at the time of writing.
During this period he has been feeding her through the narrow slit
left in the mud-plastered entrance. Both the above pairs were newly
imported less than twelve months ago.
We do not expect a high breeding rate at the Winged World,
however, as our initial fears that our exhibits--heavily stocked to
provide a worthwhile exhibition from the public point of view--are too
overcrowded for breeding. Several pairs which attempted to nest have

had to be removed as they completely disrupted the harmony of certain
enclosures. This state of affairs is not a permanent one fortunately, as it
is proposed to expand our facilities by providing quarters outside our
building for those birds demanding a less disturbed breeding territory.
An improvement in our cage labelling system is just being put into
operation. Instead of relying upon artists' impressions for identification
purposes, we are in the process of having the majority of species
recorded upon 35-mrn. colour transparencies. These are to be
incorporated into our illuminated label holders, and can also be used for
publicity purposes and articles. Yuhinas and other small active species
have proved difficult to photograph, but it is our intention to construct a
glass-fronted planted box for restraining such species in a small area
for photographic purposes. The cost of producing these transparencies
has proved to be most economical and we are also hoping to offset this
by offering a selection of the best slides for sale in our kiosks.

Popinjay is an archaic name for a parrot. But whence the name
parrot ? I have never discovered who first used this name, but
according to the dictionaries it was as long ago as 1525. Etymologists
have been at some pains to show that the word is derived from the
obsolete French perrot (pierrot), a diminutive from Pierre (Peter).
There does not seem to be any evidence that in France parrots were
ever commonly called perrots or pierrots. The latter is in fact a colloquial
name for the House Sparrow.

Longevity. On 29th June, 1930, Olin Sewell Pettingill, Jr., was
amongst a party of four that visited Duck Rock, not far offshore from
Monhegan Island, Maine. During their stay of an hour they banded
81 young Herring Gulls ( Larus argentus), whose ages averaged about
ten days. One of the nineteen young banded by Pettingill was found
dead on 20th June, 1966, by a group of Girl Scouts, on the shore of
Little Traverse Bay, near Petoskey, Michigan. This thirty-six year
life-span of a wild bird may well exceed any other so far reported.
The previous record was held also by a Herring Gull, banded as a
chick and recovered 31 years and 11 months later (see Auk , 1967, 123).

Country lore has it that anyone trying daily to eat a whole Wood
Pigeon would not survive a year. Whether death would be the result
of severe digestive disturbance or from sheer monotony is anybody's
guess. In any event, no one is likely to test the theory. But one is
reminded of this by a very descriptive account in National Geographic ,
April, 1967. Roger Tory Peterson and a party recently visited the
Galapagos Islands and in the course of their cruise dropped anchor at
San Salvador (also known as Santiago or James Island). On the
island there is a salt mine and in reference to this Peterson writes :
"For five months no boat had come to supply the men who worked the
pit. Out of provisions, they had lived mostly on the island's small wild
doves, snaring them and clubbing them with sticks. Each of these ten
men had eaten an average of ten doves a day for three months,
consuming a total of 9,000 birds." Peterson's party took off the ten
men and one imagines they were very glad of a change of diet !

The 54th Annual Report , 1966, of the Royal Zoological Society of
Scotland, recounts some very interesting but, unfortunately, unsuccess-
ful breeding attempts by a pair of Cassowaries in the Scottish National
Zoological Park, Edinburgh. "In 1965 the female laid three eggs,
and the male had taken over incubation, when it is thought the
appearance of a stray dog at the enclosure frightened the female and
caused her to run into the hut beside the sitting male. A fight ensued,
during which an electric heating tube was torn from the wall, the
smaller male bird suffered injury, and all the eggs were broken. They
were found to be fertile ; and as the male recovered from his injuries,
and the pair resumed friendly associations, precautions were taken to
prevent the repetition of such an accident in the event of the birds
again breeding. During the year under review four eggs were laid and
accepted by the male, who was then isolated, though the pair were
able to see each other. On this occasion only one egg was fertile, and
from this a chick was hatched, but it survived only for three days."

The year 1966 at the Edinburgh Zoo was a disappointing one where
the breeding Gentoo Penguins were concerned. " At the beginning
of the breeding season the colony consisted of fifty-one adult and five
one-year-old gentoos, and from this number twenty-four nests were
occupied and fifty-one eggs laid. This constituted a remarkably high
percentage, as the five year-old birds had not reached maturity.
Twenty-five chicks were hatched, which was also satisfactory, but
from then on a series of unfortunate mishaps was experienced. After
seven chicks had been lost in three weeks due to the neglect of parents,
and as the other pairs were also showing a lack of interest in their
young, it was decided to remove the surviving chicks for hand-feeding.
These accepted food freely, and appeared to be progressing, when a
number of deaths occurred from aspergillosis, only four chicks sur-
viving to the adult moult.
Of the King Penguin colony, which at the breeding season num-
bered thirty-five adults and three one-year-old chicks, twenty-six
birds paired and thirteen eggs were laid. Of these, however, only four
hatched, but all four chicks have been successfully reared " {54th

AUSTRALIAN BIRDS IN COLOUR. By Keith Hindwood.

Parrots and Grassfinches apart, the birds of Australia have been
poorly served by illustrators since Gould, and it is pleasant to find that
with the spread of colour photography they are at last coming into
their own. This is perhaps poor consolation for the European avicul-
turist who may now have good illustrations of the birds he may no
longer have the opportunity to keep. The present small volume, some
5 by 8 inches, contains a series of fifty-two colour portraits of different
Australian species, selected from the work of eleven different photo-
graphers. The pictures are mostly of adults at the nest, and have been
well chosen to present a range that includes many of the smaller and
less well-known species. The pictures are clear and the colours in
general very good, ranging from the vivid blue of the Blue Wrens to the
sober colours of Thornbills and Thrushes. Although many of the
species show vivid colours some of the best pictures in this book, to my
mind, are the soberly-clad Wonga Pigeon, the Rufous Fantail, and the
Ground Cuckoo-shrike. The only defects with which one might
quibble are the tendencies for some greys to appear too blue, and to
appear as glosses on brown plumage, as in the pictures of Lyre Bird and
Bristle-bird. The page facing each portrait contains a text account of
the species by the Australian ornithologist Keith Hindwood. His
extensive and intimate knowledge of the birds has made it possible
for him to present, not the usual rather trivial text that tends to appear
in books where the plates takes precedence, but interesting accounts
with a great deal of useful and original information.
In all I found this an enjoyable little book, and one that might well
be emulated in other regions whose birds are unfamiliar to us.

NESTING BIRDS, EGGS, AND FLEDGLINGS IN COLOUR. By
Winwood Reade and Eric Hosking. Blandford Press, London,
1967. Price 25^.
In the preface to the photographic section of this book it is claimed
that the authors have attempted " . . . to show by photographs . . . "
the principal breeding birds of Northern Europe. In this aim they have
certainly succeeded. There is a thick " wodge " of photographs
showing different species at the nest. A majority of these photographs
are coloured and the general standard of colour reproduction is very
good and, so far as my experience goes, decidedly above average.

Some, but by no means all, show nestlings, fledglings, or eggs as well
as one or both parents.
One of these pictures may well, as the proverb says, be worth a
thousand words. As, however, many of them illustrate interesting
points of behaviour (e.g. the male Girl Bunting turning his head so as
to place food in his mate's bill and thus showing the underside of his
head to the camera) and the book seems at least partly aimed at
beginners, I think some of them should have had a few words to
indicate what they show beyond the fact that the bird is a " Girl
Bunting " or whatever it may be.
The book is also illustrated with coloured plates of eggs and a great
many black and white drawings. The former are adequate, allowance
being made for modern colour-printing and the individual variability
in the eggs of many species. The latter, by Robert Gillmor, are
delightful and a main charm of the book. Besides many sketches of
adults and young of different species there are three schematic drawings
of habitats, showing the typical birds thereof and with typical nesting
sites for each indicated.
The text is mainly adequate though hardly so detailed in its descrip-
tions of breeding behaviour as the publishers' blurb might suggest.
There is, however, a tendency to make some doubtful statements
without giving the evidence (e.g. that brightly coloured drakes divert
predators from the incubating ducks, p. 4) or statements which
although sometimes true or true for some species are certainly not
always true as is implied by their context and lack of qualification
(e.g. that " song is a means of establishing territory ", p. 5, or that
" Truly wild Rock Doves nest in inaccessible sites ", p. 206).
The book is compact and convenient in size with a pleasing format.
For the photographs and drawings alone it is well worth the money.

THE AVIARY OF ADMIRAL GEORGE CHURCHILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.973648" page_id="56379204"  page_num="135" year="" vol="">
I understand that your Society is interested in establishing the whereabouts of the
aviary of Admiral George Churchill, and I send you the following scrap of information
in the hope that it may provide a clue.
I have a signed oil painting by Bogdani, which I believe was painted for the Admiral
to record some of his birds. The picture shows a village in a valley in the near distance
with a church with an unusual spire on top of a low range of hills. The birds are in
natural surroundings, chiefly waterfowl ducks and ducklings predominating species,
some of which are in flight. There is also one Kingfisher, a Blue Tit and a Yellow
Wagtail.
Leaving out of account the possibility of artistic licence and the probability that you
have some idea of the location of the aviary I have made a rough sketch below of the
church and tower, which is partly obscured by trees.
I have been working on Gra(e)y family history and genealogy for a number of years
and I appreciate just how valuable odd scraps of information such as this can be on
occasions.

IN SUPPORT OF "THE FANCY" AND THE SHOWS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.994875976190476" page_id="56379205"  page_num="136" year="" vol="">
Having long been an admirer of the articles of Mr. Derek Goodwin with their keen
observations, published in this journal, I was the more surprised at his observations on
his visit to the National Show, recorded in the January-February issue of the Maga-
zine. I feel they cannot go unchallenged.
In South Africa a note to the effect that show cages are used for the duration of the
show only appears in the catalogue and sometimes is displayed in large print in the hall,
so that the casual visitors will be aware of that fact.
I know that fanciers are occasionally misled by the craze for size or exaggerate a
defect to a ridiculous degree as in the Scotch Fancy Canary, but surely it must be
admitted that the wonderful pattern of the Lizard Canary and the striking yellows
and variegations in the other breeds do not make them " mere travesties " of Serinus
canarius ; that since the formation of the Zebra Finch Society in 1952 Taeniopygia
guttata with its remarkable mutant forms has been stamped with a degree of interest
and a quality beyond the wildest visions of breeders in the early years of this century ;
and that, though the " nebulous grey colour was relatively unattractive ", the glorious
hues of the Budgerigar, like violet and sky-blue, and the development of other features,
have made the name of Melopsittacus mdulatus illustrious the world over. These things
have been partly achieved by the " Fancy " and greatly aided by the shows, which
are the stimulus behind such avicultural endeavours. Are the values of the " Fancy "
always perverse ?
Aviculture is a hobby of many facets. Some aviculturists take to breeding the rarer
and more difficult species, especially if they can attempt a first breeding in captivity.
It is perhaps primarily with these achievements that our Society is concerned and in
which regard it has served so well these seventy-two years. Others believe that the
greatest achievement is in founding aviary-bred strains of wild species, such as
Mr. Norman Nicholson has so ably done with the Red-headed Parrot Finch. Others,
again, prefer to enter a " fancy " and breed to a standard, which can hardly always be
considered " perverse ", although some unfortunate things may have been foolishly,
though inadvertently, done. While we of this Society may not interest ourselves in
these other achievements, it is a pity to deprecate the valuable efforts of so many of
our fellow aviculturists and not to give credit where credit is due.
To breed Budgerigars is one of the last things I should personally like to do, but, in
contrast to Mr. Goodwin, whenever I visit a show of Budgerigars, I do not wistfully
long for the original wild bird. I, for one, find the fuller development of their size and
natural or mutant features, provided not overdone, most attractive ; and the overall
achievement, looking back down the years, quite amazing. In fact I do not think
that natural beauty ends in the wild state. If the blue and lutino Ringnecks are
anything to go by, I hope that a great deal more of natural beauty is waiting to be
unlocked and developed by aviculturists in the years ahead. If we stand still we shall
perish : we must go on and the fanciers and the shows have a not inconsiderable part
to play, provided that the standards are sane ; and I am sufficiently optimistic to hope
that wisdom in the matter will prevail.

CROSS BETWEEN PHEASANT AND BANTAM
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996469222222222" page_id="56379206"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
There are few references to crosses between pheasants and chickens, but I did not
expect one to appear in my aviaries as the result of a little indiscretion on the part of a
golden hen bantam and a cock Silver Pheasant. The bantam was running with a
trio of pheasants intending to be foster-mother for the chicks in due course, and I had
picked her for her good colours. Apparently the plumpness of her form caught the
eye of the pheasant and the first notion I had of any happening was when my Boy
said, " Master, he is using her for a wife." Even then the impact did not sink in, and in
due time the bantam went broody on a clutch of five Silver Pheasant's eggs.
Apparently as a gesture of affection towards her pheasant-lover she added one of her
own eggs. Some weeks later I was surprised to see six chicks emerge and the stranger has
grown into a fine bird clearly showing its mixed ancestry.
It is a mule with male colouring and is slightly heavier (strangely enough) than an
ordinary Silver Pheasant, and about the same shape but with a somewhat shorter tail.
The silhouette is therefore of a pheasant, but the colouring is much more like the
bantam, being generally a speckled golden brown. It is an alert bird but is generally
shunned by the others, of both sexes, which is why I conclude that it is a mule ; but
it is quite well behaved in the aviary, apart from, unfortunately, regarding any eggs as
items of diet.

IN REARING HUMMINGBIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9927504" page_id="56379206"  page_num="137" year="" vol="">
I hope you will allow me to comment on the " Notes " in the May-June number in
which Mr. P. H. Hastings had so much to say about my article on " Near Miss " in
rearing Hummingbirds.
First, I would mention that Mr. Hastings recently made similar statements on the
use of sugar and protein foods in Cage and Aviary Birds in regard to an article by
Mr. Fell, of Lincoln, on his experiences in keeping hummingbirds and feeding them
on these foods. In the considerable correspondence which followed and which was
published in that paper Mr. Fell and others made it quite clear to Mr. Hastings that
the protein foods contained all the necessary vitamins.
However, to return to the " Notes ", I would mention that this year the same pair of
Violet-eared Hummingbirds produced two eggs, hatched one chick and reared it to
independence. It is now three months old and is as fit and as powerful on the wing as
any hummer I have seen. It was reared on Gevral-Protein-Vitamin-Mineral Food,
sugar and water to the formula which Mr. Hastings takes so much exception to, plus,
of course, plenty of fruit flies. I have a complete daily record of the intake of nectar
by mother and chick as compared to the intake by the cock, from the day it was
hatched until it reached independence and the quantity of " dangerous " nectar
consumed was quite substantial. The information is available to anyone interested.
The protein food I use contains Vitamins A, D (as yeast), Bi, B2, B6, B12, C, E as
well as many minerals and, of course, proteins which are digested perfectly well by the
birds. In fact this particular protein food is, I have been told by doctors, produced
mainly for invalids and geriatrics who sometimes have difficulty in digesting proteins
in o&quot;her forms. I hasten to add that I have no financial interest in this, or any other,
bird food and I don't suppose the manufacturer would really notice if I ceased to use
my daily one-third of an ounce which, with sugar, feeds my forty nectar drinkers !
Finally, if hummingbirds and sunbirds are so easy to breed and rear on some of the
foods sold specially for these birds in this country, then why is it that aviculturists have
not succeeded better in keeping and breeding nectar drinkers ? I venture to prophesy
that perhaps the lean days are over and now that many aviculturists are keeping
hummingbirds and sunbirds in planted aviaries instead of in cages, plus (dare I say it ?),

feeding with protein foods and sugar, breeding successes in the future will much
more frequent. All my hummingbirds and sunbirds have access to open flights all the
year round (unless there is a day frost) and are only shut in at night during the winter
and early spring. I know some aviculturists who never shut their hummingbirds
inside even in the winter. Surely people who keep these acclimatized birds must be
credited with some common sense in the food they choose to use ! My young Violet-
eared Hummingbird could possibly have been reared on other foods, I just don't
know, but what I do know is that there is a great difference in the knowledge, experi-
ence, and feeding skills required by the dealer to get the birds over the first few days
after importation, keep them as short a time as possible before selling them and those
of the buyer who has the problems of acclimatization to overcome before there is any
hope of a long life for the bird. I give Mr. Hastings full marks for his unrivalled skills
as the importer and dealer, but as the buyer I do not accept his feeding suggestion.

io. The Double-eyed Fig Parrot
(Opopsitta diophthalma)
The Double-eyed Fig Parrot, or Lorilet as it is often called in
Australia, is a polytypic species widely distributed throughout New
Guinea and the adjacent islands and along the coast of north-eastern
Australia as far south as northern New South Wales. It was first
described in 1841 by Hombron and Jacquinot from specimens collected
near what is now Triton Bay on the southern coast of West Irian. They
placed it in the genus Psittacula. It was subsequently realized that this
name had been used in 1800 by Cuvier for a group of Asiatic parrots.
Therefore the name Opopsitta , proposed by Sclater in i860, was
accepted and diophthalma designated the type.
In the adult male the hind-neck, mantle, back, wings, rump, and
upper side of the very short, pointed tail are rich dark green. Some of
the feathers on the back and wings are faintly margined with black
giving an inconspicuous scalloped effect. The underparts are bright
yellowish-green becoming paler and more yellowish towards the lower
abdomen and vent. The wing primaries and secondaries are rich dark
blue on the outer edges and brownish-black on the inner sides. On
the innermost median wing-coverts there is a bright orange-red
marking. Under the wings the sides of the body are strongly washed
with bright yellow. The underwing-coverts are bluish-green. Rich
dark red is exhibited on the forehead, the forepart of the crown, the
lores, and on the ear-coverts. This is bordered on the crown by a
variable golden-yellow band and on the lower cheeks by a bright
mauve-blue marking. A bright sky-blue spot above and in front of the
eye is responsible for the bird's peculiar name. The bill is pale grey at
the base merging into darkest grey towards the tip, the iris is dark
brown, and the feet greenish-grey. Adult females and immatures have
the lower cheeks buff-brown instead of red, and below the red line
extending underneath the eye there are some pale blue feathers which

A number of sub-species of Opopsitta diophthalma have been described.
The author (1967 b) has discussed the status of each of these forms and
the following is a resume of that work.
[a) The New Guinea Sub-species.

inhabits West Irian, including the western islands, and western New

Guinea as far east as Astrolabe Bay in the north and Etna Bay in the
south.
In 1902 a specimen said to have come from the east coast of
Bougainville in the Solomon Islands was examined by Madarasz, who,
because of the darker green of its body plumage, described 0 . d.
festetichi. The species does not occur in the Solomon Islands and the
type locality was altered to Astrolabe Bay in northern New Guinea.
Peters (1937) and Mayr (1941) synonymized this race with diophthalma ,
but Gyldenstolpe (1955) advocated its acceptance and referred to it
ten specimens collected by him near Nondugl in the Wahgi Valley.
The author examined two males and a female from the Kubor Range
and found them to be darker in colour and larger in size than the
nominate race. Pending the acquisition of more specimens it seems
advisable to accept 0 . d. festetichi for the birds from the Astrolabe Bay
area in northern New Guinea.
The separation of 0 . d. coccineifrons, the race inhabiting south-
eastern New Guinea, by Sharpe in 1882 was based on specimens
collected in the Astrolabe Mountains. The original description stated
that it differed from diophthalma by having the lores, cheeks, and front
of the face dull red, not scarlet. Ogilvie-Grant (1915) said that it was
easily separable as a sub-species because in the male the red on the
forehead and cheeks was dull crimson-scarlet and the yellow band
across the crown was distinctly wider. In nine specimens examined by
the author there was considerable variation in the red of the cheeks and
forehead, but the wide yellow band on the crown was a constant
character. In addition the red on the innermost median wing-coverts
was darker than in diophthalma , but paler than in festetichi. Although
an examination of a larger series of specimens could result in the
synonymizing of festetichi with coccineifrons , both races should be
accepted for the present.
Southern New Guinea between the Mimika and Fly Rivers, as well
as the Am Islands, constitute the range of O. d. aruensis. Separated by
Schlegel in 1874, this race is at once distinguished by the lighter, more
yellowish, green of the upper parts and by a complete absence of red
from the facial markings of females and immatures. The forehead and
crown are bright blue with buff-brown bases to the feathers ; the lores
and cheeks are buff-brown bordered below by mauve-blue bands
extending to and becoming paler on the chin. The adult male resembles
the male of coccineifrons but has the blue patch above the eye more
greenish in colour and restricted in extent.
Fergusson and Goodenough Islands, in the D'Entrecasteaux Group,
New Guinea, are inhabited by 0 . d. virago , a race originally described
by Hartert in 1895. The adult male differs from the male of aruensis
by the absence of the blue patch from in front of and above the eye, by
the replacement of the mauve-blue bands below the cheeks by a bright

blue spot on either side of the neck, and by the paler red on the crown
and face. The adult female has the periophthalmic region green
instead of blue as in aruensis , has a well-defined bright red spot on the
middle of the forehead, has the cheeks green with a few pale blue and
buff markings, and lacks the mauve-blue bands under the cheeks.
An almost complete absence of sexual dimorphism is found in
0 . d. inseparahilis from Tagula Island, in the Louisiade Archipelago,
New Guinea. This distinct insular sub-species was described by
Hartert in 1898. Both sexes resemble the female of virago and have the
entire head, except the forehead and forepart of the crown, bright
green as on the underparts. The forehead is bright red bordered
behind on the forepart of the crown by bright blue.
(b) The Australian Sub-species .
Keast (1961) cited 0 . diophthalma in Australia as an example of the ?
speciation process acting on isolated populations. The isolates are ;|
confined to the three major tracts of rain-forest occurring between the !
mountain range and the seaboard along the north-eastern coast. As
stated by Keast, coxeni and macleayana are approaching the degree of
differentiation typical of a species, whereas marshalli is probably a
recent immigrant.
In 1911, while camped a few miles from the Jardine River on Gape
York Peninsula, a prominent collector and fieldworker named
McLennan noted a pair of small " lorikeets 33 feeding high up in a
flowering bloodwood tree (Eucalyptus sp.). One was shot but fell into
thick brush and could not be located. McLennan stated that he was
sure that the birds were Cyclopsitta maccoyi (= 0 . d, macleayana).
Nothing further was heard of the presence of fig parrots on Gape York
Peninsula for more than thirty years. In the latter part of 1942, while
engaged in military operations near the Lockhart River, Captain A. J.
Marshall sighted fig parrots feeding in flowering trees on the fringe of
the jungle. Three specimens were collected, labelled as Opopsitta
leadbeateri (= 0 . d. macleayana ), and forwarded to the Australian
Museum in Sydney. They were examined three years later by Iredale
and, because of their striking difference from leadbeateri (-- macleayana ),
he described Opopsitta marshalli as a new species. Mayr (1947) com-
pared Iredale's description and drawing of marshalli with specimens of
aruensis and declared that he could find not a single difference. He
stated that absolute identity could not be established until the Gape
York specimens were compared directly with specimens of aruensis but,
until a valid distinction was found, marshalli would have to be con-
sidered a synonym of aruensis. To date doubts have always existed
concerning the status of this race and many authors have followed
Mayr's recommendation.

Despite the work carried out on Cape York Peninsula by collectors
and field observers, no sightings of Marshall's Fig Parrot, as 0 . d.
marshalli came to be called, were reported for more than twenty years
and it was presumed to be very rare. Then in 1963, during a brief
visit to Iron Range on the Claudie River, the author met with this
small, elusive parrot once again (see Forshaw, 1966).
Meanwhile pests had caused such severe damage to the syntypical
material of 0 . d. marshalli that it was useless for determining the status
of the race. The author, under a grant from the Frank M. Chapman
Memorial Fund of the American Museum of Natural History, led an
expedition back to Iron Range in January, 1966, for the purpose of
collecting new specimens. An examination of these specimens showed
that marshalli was indeed a valid race.
Although 0 . d. marshalli from Cape York Peninsula does resemble
aruensis there are, nevertheless, notable differences. In the adult male
the blue patch in front of and above the eye is deeper and darker than
in aruensis and has no greenish tinge, and the blue on the outer edges
of the primaries is darker. In the adult female the feathers on the fore-
part of the crown are tipped with bright violet-blue instead of pale
sky-blue. Unfortunately, no new specimens of the immature male were
collected. It is the smallest parrot inhabiting Australia ; two specimens
collected by the author and deposited in the C.S.I.R.O. collection
gave the following

The events leading up to the describing of 0 . d. macleayana from the
coastal regions of northern Queensland are most interesting. They have
been presented in detail by Chisholm (1929) so we may restrict their
repetition here to a brief summary. In 1874 specimens of a new fig
parrot were collected by K. Broadbent in the forests near Cardwell on
the north Queensland coast. He immediately contacted Dr. Ramsay
in Sydney, Professor McCoy in Melbourne, and John Gould in
London. All three went ahead and described the new species. Probably
on account of his reputation, Gould won recognition and his Cyclop-
sitta (= Opopsitta ) maccoyi was generally accepted. Unable to locate
Ramsay's description, Mathews (1917) adopted McCoy's leadbeateri
because it appeared one month earlier than Gould's description. His
action was almost universally followed until 1929 when Chisholm
found Ramsay's original description and showed that, because it
predated the others by more than six months, the proposed specific
name of macleayana was valid. Peters (1937) used macleayana thus giving
a recognized taxonomist's approval to Chisholm's findings.
The adult male macleayana has only the centre of the forehead and

the lower cheeks red, the remainder of the facial area being blue,
darker on the sides of the forehead, paler and more greenish around
the eyes. The adult female and immatures have the lower cheeks
buff-brown with bluish markings.
From a specimen collected on the Barron River, north Queensland,
Mathews described 0 . d. boweri and stated that it differed from
leadbeateri (-- macleayana ) by " being less conspicuously marked, the
red on the face and forehead not so bright, the yellow on the sides of
the body not so pronounced ". The author examined the type and two
other specimens from the type locality at the American Museum of
Natural History in New York and found that the slight colour
differences were due to nothing more than the normal individual
variation that is shown in any species of bird. Therefore, boweri must
be synonymized with macleayana.
In 1866 the fig parrot was added to Australia's impressive list of
parrots when specimens were sent by Eli Waller, a Brisbane bird-dealer,
to John Gould. The following year Gould described the new bird,
calling it Cyclopsitta (= Opopsitta ) coxeni in honour of Charles Coxen,
his brother-in-law. 0 . d. coxeni inhabits the coastal rain-forests of
southern Queensland and northern New South Wales from Mary-
borough in the north to the Macleay River in the south. It is decidedly
larger than either marshalli or macleayana and is the second sub-species
lacking marked sexual dimorphism. Both sexes have the crown green
with a few blue feathers on the centre of the forehead ; the cheeks are
orange-red bordered below by a variable mauve-blue band. In the
specimens examined by the author adult males had some reddish
feathers on the lores and surrounding the blue on the forehead ; they
also had slightly brighter and more extensive red cheeks and deeper
blue primaries than did the feamles.
When he introduced 0 . d. tweedi in 1917 Mathews did not give any
distinguishing features. He merely stated that it was based on the
specimen described and figured in his Birds of Australia (1917). This
specimen had been collected on the Tweed River in northern New
South Wales. As well as the type another male from the type locality
was examined in New York by the author, but no differences dis-
tinguishing them from coxeni could be found. This race must be
synonymized with coxeni.

From the time of its discovery in Australia 0 . diophthalma has
retained the status of an unknown, talked about by many ornithologists
but actually observed by very few. In 1929, sixty-two years after
coxeni was described, Chisholm asked, " Is there any genus of Australian
birds, containing more than one species, so little known as the Lorilets
or Fig-Parrots ? " While it is true that we have acquired much more

information on the life history of this species during the intervening
years, there is no doubt that it still remains one of the least known of
the Australian parrots. This lack of knowledge seems to be due not so
much to the rarity of the bird, for it may not be rare at all, but to the
difficulty in observing it. A small green parrot living amongst the upper
branches of tall trees growing in a dense forest is of course easily
overlooked.
As mentioned above, the Double-eyed Fig Parrot is restricted to the
three remaining patches of rain-forest on the north-eastern coast of the
continent. Observations suggest that within its range each sub-species
is probably distributed throughout most of the forested areas. However,
it must be pointed out that very few of these areas are extensive and
nearly all are being affected by land clearance and the implementation
of agricultural programmes.
Coxen's Fig Parrot, as 0 . d. coxeni is called, has been subjected to
more loss of habitat than has either of the other races. It is now
confined to the less accessible regions still supporting suitable forest.
In 1955, while the author was spending a few days on a dairy farm at
Uki near Murwillumbah, N.S.W., a cat brought in the remains of one
of these parrots. Having been informed that the cat had been success-
ful in catching Little Lorikeets (Glossopsitta pusilla) in a locquat tree
growing near the cow bails, I decided to investigate the possibility of
the fig parrot having come from the same tree. I went down and
threw a large piece of wood into the foliage. A flock of lorikeets accom-
panied by three fig parrots flew from the tree. The fig parrots were
distinguishable in flight by their noticeably heavier bodies, rounded
wings and very short tails, by their direct instead of weaving flight, and
by their distinct call notes. Of course it cannot be taken for granted
that they were feeding in the tree, but such was probably the case.
In 1928 a few Coxen's Fig Parrots were seen feeding in fig trees at
George's Creek on the Upper Macleay River, N.S.W., the southern-
most locality for the species as well as for the race. The northernmost
record for the sub-species is from Urangen, near Maryborough,
Queensland, where a nest was found in 1934. Localities within these
limits from which it has been reported include Gympie, the Blackall
Ranges, the Brisbane area and Stanthorpe in Queensland, and the
Tweed, Richmond and Clarence River districts in New South Wales.
In 1962 it was seen in Tooloom Scrub on the Upper Clarence River,
N. S.W. Here two birds were sighted on successive days and a single
bird on the third day. All were found in or near fig trees and the
remark was made that, once they had alighted, their small size and
protective coloration, coupled with the density of the foliage, rendered
observation virtually impossible.
Most of the information we have obtained on the life history of
O . diophthalma has been the result of observations carried out on the

146 JOSEPH M. FORSHAW-THE PARROTS OF AUSTRALIA
Red-browed Fig Parrot, as 0 . d. macleayana is usually called. This race
inhabits the coastal rain-forest between Gooktown and Cardwell or
possibly Townsville. Throughout these areas it appears to be quite ;
numerous and pairs or small parties may be seen feeding on the fruits
of native figs or flying above the treetops. Occasionally they visit the
parks and gardens in Cairns and Innisfail. In 1963 the author had a
fleeting glimpse of two birds flying above the forest canopy near Lake
Eacham.
Bourke and Austin (1947) found that 0 . d. macleayana frequented
open woodland and partly cleared country along the coast as well as
the dense forests and scrubs. During the day it fed in trees growing on
the edge of the primary forest or in the secondary forest and at dusk
returned to the interior of the jungle to roost. One or two large trees
were used by all the birds from the area in which the authors worked
and at times the flock built up in numbers until it contained more than
a hundred parrots. Early the next morning pairs and small parties !
departed from the tree in all directions on their way to the feeding
grounds.
Marshall's Fig Parrot is the race which the author has studied in the
field. Information gathered during a period of one week in 1963 and
another of three weeks in 1966 on Cape York Peninsula is the basis of
the details of ecology and habits given below. It has been supplemented
by the addition of the meagre published notes concerning macleayana
and coxeni.
The secretive habits of fig parrots are well demonstrated by the fact
that, although they were ultimately found to be particularly abundant
in the Iron Range area, only a single bird was seen during my visit in
1963 and four days had elapsed before they were sighted in 1966. As
I became more familiar with their habits the task of observing them
became less difficult and birds were located every day.
In the Iron Range area the predominant vegetation type is savannah
woodland and only along the banks of the Claudie River and the many
streams or creeks running into it from the mountain ridges and valleys i
are there extensive patches of rain-forest. However, marshalli appeared
to be a true dweller of the dense forest. Early in the morning and
towards dusk pairs or small parties were often seen in the open wood-
land making their way from one patch of forest to another. During
bright and sunny weather they travelled by means of short flights from
one eucalypt or melaleuca to another, pausing on the topmost branches
to preen their feathers. On the other hand, if it was overcast or wet
they made only one or, more frequently, no stopovers at all. Imitation
of the call-notes upset this pattern and caused the birds to call loudly
while repeatedly circling back to the nearest tree. Only on two
occasions were parrots flushed from trees in the open woodland during
the day and neither of these trees was more than 30 feet from the edge

of a patch of rain-forest. Of course it is possible that at certain times
of the year they leave the forest to feed in flowering eucalypts or
melaleucas, thus accounting for McLennan's observation in 1913.
During my stay flocks of Rainbow Lorikeets ( Trichoglossus haematodus)
were seen feeding in flowering melaleucas but they were not accom-
panied by fig parrots.
Our most memorable encounter with Marshall's Fig Parrot in the
wild state occurred during the 1966 visit. A member of our party
located a large Black Bean tree ( Castanospermum australe) in which a
number of Eclectus Parrots ( Lorius roratus) roosted each night. Late
one afternoon I took up a position at a vantage point overlooking this
tall tree towering above the rain-forest canopy at the foot of the hill.
Towards dusk the Eclectus Parrots, accompanied by two Sulphur-
crested Cockatoos ( Cacatua galerita), come in to roost. As the last rays
of sunshine filtered through the clouds and danced across the forested
valley, the harsh, grating calls, that had been coming from the tree
since the arrival of the first Eclectus Parrots, were joined by incessant,
high-pitched screeches. The topmost branches became a hub of activity
with small birds hurtling into the foliage from the enclosing darkness.
They were fig parrots and there were hundreds of them. By nightfall
eighty-four Eclectus Parrots, two Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, and a
great number of fig parrots were roosting in this one tree. Early next
morning a companion accompanied me back to the same position and
together we awaited sunrise. The first light of the new day exposed a
remarkable panorama before us. Moisture trapped in the forests of
the valley rose as columns of fine mist and one would be forgiven for
believing them to be jets of steam. Birds began to sing and move about
in the treetops. The loud booming call of a Cassowary ( Casuarius
casuarius ) echoed up from the valley. Purple-crowned ( Ptilinopus
superbus) and Wompoo Pigeons (Megaloprepia magnified) flew from tree
to tree, their brilliant colours flashing in the now rapidly increasing
sunlight. White-tailed Kingfishers ( Tanysiptera sylvia) darted through
the scrub, their long tails streaming behind them. Nearby a Magni-
ficent Rifle Bird ( Ptiloris magnificus) commenced to call and the loud,
clear notes carried across to the other side of the valley where another
bird returned the greeting. Torres Strait Pigeons (Ducula spilorrhod)
and Rainbow Lorikeets were passing high overhead on their way to
the feeding grounds. The large roosting tree was almost bursting at
the seams with movement ; Eclectus Parrots were preening their
feathers and stretching their wings, and fig parrots were fluttering
from branch to branch. Suddenly there was an eruption and fig parrots
flew from the tree in all directions. As if this was a signal, the Eclectus
Parrots rose high into the air and, calling loudly, made their way over
the hilltops and then down towards the river. During the next
forty minutes an estimated 200 or more fig parrots left the tree. This

number does not include the birds that were on the opposite side of
the tree and hidden from view. A Great Palm Cockatoo (Probosciger
aterrimus ) raised its crest and called loudly before leaving its perch atop
a leafless uppermost branch of a tall tree standing in the valley below
our observation post. A pair of Red-cheeked Parrots ( Geoffroyus
geoffroyi) paused momentarily in the eucalypt under which we were
standing and then continued their flight down to the valley. On the
way back to camp we agreed that the sighting of hundreds of Marshall's
Fig Parrots, hitherto regarded as being rare, had been the highlight
of a memorable experience.
The flight is direct and rather swift. Between each series of wingbeats
the wings are withdrawn in towards the body, but so rapid is the entire
action that it produces no noticeable undulation in the overall flight
pattern. The parrots fly in a straight line and do not indulge in
twisting and turning through the trees, a feature so characteristic of
the flight of many other species of parrots. Rather than move through
the forest trees they prefer to fly above the canopy.
Two calls were given by 0 . d. marshalli. The one most frequently
heard was a sharp, penetrative squeak uttered two or three times in
succession, each note being quite distinct and not merged into the next.
This call was given when the bird was alarmed, just after alighting,
prior to departure, or at frequent intervals during flight. The other
call, a high-pitched rolling screech, was given only when the birds
were in the air, and, strangely enough, was given more regularly
towards dusk than in the morning. Bourke and Austin ( loc . cit.) I
report that macleayana often emits a soft chattering call while feeding,
but this was not heard from marshalli.
Fig parrots feed on nectar from flowers as well as fruits and berries,
particularly native figs. Bourke and Austin reported macleayana
feeding on the fruits of Ficus eugenioides and Ficus ehretii. The parrots
would bite a piece out of the fruit and gradually reduce it, discarding
the unwanted portions which fell in a steady stream to the ground.
I observed the same procedure being used by marshalli when feeding
on the fruits of Ficus and Croton trees. Coxen's Fig Parrot has been seen
in the company of Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans) feeding on the
fruit of the Blue Fig (Elaeocarpus grandis) and with Scaly-breasted
(Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus) and Musk Lorikeets ( Glossopsitta concinna)
feeding on nectar from the flowers of the Silky Oak ( Grevillea robusta).
In 1963 I observed a male marshalli feeding in a small Bletharocarya
involucrigera tree growing in forest on the banks of the Claudie River.
It appeared to be eating the bark of the tree or a fungal growth which
may have been on the branch. If fluttered to the upright branch and
removed some of the bark or fungus, while holding on to the face of
the branch and using its tail for support in the same way as does a
woodpecker. A few seconds seemed to be sufficient time for the removal

of a piece of bark or fungus and then the parrot returned to a nearby
horizontal twig to crush and digest what it had taken. This entire
operation was repeated four or five times.
Very little information has been published concerning the nesting of
0 . diophthalma. In October, 1944, Bourke and Austin found two nests
of macleayana in the Cairns district. Both were about 30 feet from the
ground in small hollows in trees, one a Melaleuca , growing in open wood-
land on a coastal flat. Each contained two white eggs. Some doubts
have been expressed concerning the two eggs of Coxen's Fig Parrot
taken from a hollow in a rotting tree trunk lying on the ground in open
forest near Maryborough, Queensland. The parrot using the nest was
identified as coxeni from skins loaned to the observer. However, the
unusual site of the nest led some ornithologists to believe that it was
occupied by Budgerigars ( Melopsittacus undulatus). It must be pointed
out that in New Guinea some species of parrots have been recorded
nesting in rotting tree trunks (see Rand, 1942 a), hence the site may not
be so unusual. Furthermore, a comparison of the two white rounded
eggs with three clutches of eggs of Melopsittacus in the H. L. White
Collection shows a size difference. The eggs of coxeni measure 15 by
12 mm. as against an average of 17-9 by 14-4 mm. for those of
Melopsittacus. The author is unable to find any valid reason for doubting
that the eggs taken near Maryborough in 1934 are those of coxeni.
The nest of marshalli has not been described nor has the time of the
year during which it breeds been determined. Marshall collected the
original immature male in September and also noted that the adult
female collected at the same time had developing oocytes. No males
collected by the author in January were in immature plumage and in
none of the adults was there any gonadal development. The Civil
Aviation Officer at Iron Range informed us that in the May prior to
our arrival a pair of marshalli were nesting in a hole in the trunk of a
small tree growing on the edge of a clearing in the rain-forest near a
camp being used by a geological survey party. He believed that the
parrots always nested at this time of the year, that is after the wet
season. He also thought that the birds themselves excavated the
hollow in the soft, fibrous trunk of a particular type of tree. This
immediately brings to mind Rand's (1942 a , b) report that in New
Guinea pigmy parrots ( Micropsitta spp.) and Geoffroyus spp. excavate
their own nesting hollows.
The Double-eyed Fig Parrot is a rare bird in captivity so most of
the following suggestions concerning management are conjecture
based on what is known of its habits in the wild state. As well as being
a popular pet with the native peoples of New Guinea, the nominate
race has been kept in aviaries in Europe, the U.S.A., New Guinea, and
Australia. Rigid protection laws have been largely responsible for
keeping the Australian sub-species out of aviculture. A spacious,

well-planted flight with full shelter against winds and draughts should
prove satisfactory for the species. In cold climates the provision of
some form of artificial heating would be essential. Aviculturists who
have been fortunate enough to possess this charming parrot describe
it as being a good aviary bird, settling down well and becoming quite
tame and affectionate. However, it also has a reputation for being
very delicate, having a short life-span and usually succumbing to fits
after eighteen months or two years in confinement. The inclusion of
sunflower seed in the diet may have been the cause of this. It seems i
logical that fruits such as apples, apricots, pears, grapes, and figs should
be the basic ingredients of the diet. Almonds, walnut kernels, and
berries like hawthorn and pyracantha could be offered as additives.
Charcoal might be a valuable aid to digestion and in preventing
abnormal growth of the bill. In addition a nectar mixture comprising
equal parts of honey and sweetened condensed milk (or infants 5 food)
to three parts of water should be provided at regular intervals.
Although reported to be docile in captivity 0 . diophthalma could
become aggressive towards its own kind as well as towards other species
if breeding were attempted. The author is not aware of any recorded
breeding success in captivity, but a hollow log lined with fine grit or
wood shavings should prove satisfactory. Because of their diet fig
parrots excrete liquid droppings so it is recommended that the nesting
sites be constructed in such a way as to allow regular cleaning.
The Double-eyed Fig Parrot is an inhabitant of Australia's tropical
forests, where it frequents tall fruit-bearing trees. Even the most
ardent observer may be rewarded with only a brief glimpse of pairs or
small parties as they move from tree to tree. Nevertheless, only by
patient and careful observation will we learn more about the life-
history of this strange little parrot.

been associated with the Society as an officer for over forty-four years.
She was the only person in the whole history of the society who
successively held the three offices of Hon. Secretary, Vice-President,
and President.
She was the elder daughter of Edward Ball Knobel, an astronomer
and oriental scholar, who was President of the Royal Astronomical
Society and a member of the Board of Visitors of the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich. He wrote a number of papers on ancient and oriental
astronomy, and was interested in music and photography. Maud
Knobel shared her father's interests and, like him, was a member of
the Royal Institution of Great Britain. She became a Fellow of the

regularly attended the scientific meetings.
But it was as an aviculturist and specialist in parrots that she was
internationally renowned. As the late Dr. Amsler wrote in the
Magazine on Miss Knobel's retirement as Hon. Secretary in 1948 :
" A gift of a pair of Doves started this little lady on the fascinating road
of aviculture at the tender age of two years ; then followed a Canary
which lived for twenty years, a good proof of the meticulous care which
she has ever since bestowed on her birds and other pets. The Canary
was followed by hand-reared Blackbirds, Thrushes, a Magpie, and a
Rook, but the most remarkable was most certainly a Sparrow, a
species which, although cheeky and fearless in the wild, does not lend
itself well to cage life. The bird learned the song of the Canary and
when liberated found himself a mate and reared a family which he
brought back to his old cage-home for food. Finally, in 1911, the first
Parrot, a Blue-fronted Amazon, was purchased, and this started a
series of birds of this tribe for which Miss Knobel has become justly
famous. Of the forty-two species of Amazons she has kept twenty-
seven and there have of course been many African Greys, Cockatoos,
Parrakeets, Lovebirds, Budgerigars, and so forth."
During her studies of the skins and skeletons of the psitticines Miss
Knobel discovered the difference in the pelvic structure of males and
females, and was regarded as a great authority on sexing these birds.
She contributed a large number of valuable and interesting articles to

others.
Though of such advanced years her sight, hearing, and memory
were in no way impaired and she continued to take an active part in
the affairs of the Avicultural Society up to the end, fully intending to
preside over the autumn Council meeting. Her last public act was in
March last when she presented the President's medal to Monsieur
Jean Delacour with an eloquent and well-informed speech. Miss
Knobel had very wide interests ranging from music to boxing, which
she followed avidly on television ; she was also no mean snooker player.

An Hon. Secretary&apos;s Appreciation
Forty years have passed since I first met " Maudie ". Having a deep
interest in parrots we had something in common and our friendship
endured down the years. It was, in fact, " Maudie " who first called
me " A. A.".
Many tributes will be paid to " Maudie's " memory, so I am con-
fining this appreciation to her services to the Society.
" Maudie " was asked to become Hon. Secretary on a temporary
basis when illness necessitated the resignation of J. L. Bonhote, in
June, 1922. At that time the Society was moribund, due mainly to the
post-war slump. Membership had dropped to about 240 and the
financial position was critical. But thanks to " Maudie's " persuasive
powers it was saved from extinction by the united generosity of the then
Members of Council, who subscribed liberally to put the Society on its
feet again. During the following years she unremittingly nursed the
fortunes of the Society and they gradually but steadily improved.
The tenure of office was stretched to five, ten, and then twenty years
and, as Dr. Amsler has said, no one was " foolish enough to suggest any
substitute for her services ". And then eventually, after twenty-six
years' yeoman service, " Maudie " retired. She had borne the brunt
of the slump after the First World War, carried on during the Second,
and for the very difficult period following it. But in 1948 she decided
that the time really had come when someone just a little younger in age,
even if not in heart, should relieve her of what had been merely a
temporary appointment.
During the take-over period " Maudie " was kindness itself and I am
very grateful indeed for her guidance and advice during that time.
Since the foundation of the Society seventy-four years ago there have
been, apart from " Maudie ", eleven Hon. Secretaries. None has or is
ever likely to do as much for the Society as " Our Maudie ".

Maud Knobel and I joined the Avicultural Society the same year, in
1916, but it was not until 1922, when she was elected our Secretary,
that we became really well acquainted. As everyone knows, she was a
great Parrot lover and expert, and I never could think of her except
with her birds and her dogs. There were always dozens of cages in her
rooms.
She rendered immense services to the Society, later on as Vice-
President since 1948 and as President after 1963. She was always
present and efficient, no matter how old she was, nor how much hurt
in accidents. It is hard to believe that she has now left this world.
Her keen mind and determined spirit never failed her and one came
to think that she would always be with us.
I am perhaps the last of the older members who has taken an active
part in the work of the Society since half a century, and because of our
old and affectionate association Miss Knobel's departure has grieved
me deeply ; we had in common so many fond memories. She will be
missed by many and always be remembered as a particularly capable
and devoted officer of our Society.
J. Delacour,
Vice-President .
It was with a sense of deep personal loss that I heard yesterday,
10th August, of the loss of our dear Miss Knobel, whom I had seen for
the last time only two days earlier when she had discussed birds with
her usual interest and animation. She was a lifelong friend of my
father and for a great many of those years Secretary to the Avicultural
Society and later its much loved President. She had great knowledge
of birds, especially parrots, of which she always had at least three in her
bedroom, and she was also a great dog lover and kept Pekinese.
She was a wonderful woman with her keen interest in life, people,
also music, and she maintained this love until the end of her long life.
One can hardly imagine the Avicultural Society without Maud
Knobel. It is indeed the end of an era and she will be sorely missed by
her many friends.
Ruth Ezra.
I cannot allow the passing of our late President, Miss Maud E.
Knobel, to go by without paying my personal tribute to her memory.
Although precluded from attending many gatherings of our Society,
due to circumstances over which I had no control, over the years I
had the pleasure of conversation with her on many occasions and this
never occurred unaccompanied by a smile of welcome. If my memory
serves me correctly her regular attendances at meetings and other
gatherings of the Society must have amounted to a unique total. As

(.Member of the Society since 1904.)
We would like to express our sorrow at the passing of Miss Maud
Knobel. She became a Fellow of the Zoological Society in 1920 and
was so well known to all members of the staff as to be regarded as
almost an essential part of the Zoo. Many of these staff members are
now retired and we are certain that all would wish us to speak on their
behalf.
Although all the staff knew her, naturally those of the bird sections,
particularly the small birds and parrots, came into closer contact with
her. She was always one of the first to come and view any new addi-
tions and enliven the proceedings with her friendly, cheerful ways and
conversation. Her bright personality and interest continued until the
last and made one often forget her advanced age. Her experience with
all kinds of birds was very great indeed, while her knowledge--which
she was always ready to impart--and skill with parrot-like birds was
unique.
She was the possessor of a most happy and unforgettable personality
and the passing of Miss Knobel will be sadly mourned by all who knew
her, but we can be consoled by the fact that she enjoyed a very full life
with her many friends and interests up to the last.

(.Phoenicurus ochrurus rujiventris )
By Mrs. K. M. Scamell (Newdigate, Surrey, England)
Black Redstarts of various races occur in Europe, N.W. Africa, and
in parts of Asia. According to Popular Handbook of Indian Birds , by
Hugh Whistler, two races are found in India, P. 0 . phoenicuroides which
breeds in Persia, Turkestan, Afghanistan, and in the high mountain
areas of Kashmir and western Tibet, but wintering in the plains of
N.W. India, and P. 0. rufiventris which breeds from Tibet to China and
winters in S.W. China, Burma, Assam, N.E. Central and Southern
India. The Indian Black Redstart has been seen on migration as high
as 20,000 feet and is reported as having nests up to 17,000 feet in the
Himalayas ( The Redstart , by John Buxton).
The male Indian Black Redstart (P. 0. rufiventris) differs in appearance
from the male European Black Redstart (P. 0. gibraltariensis) by having
chestnut-red underparts and no white wing bars. Moreover the colour
of the eggs is a light greeny-blue, lighter but nearer in colour to those
of the Redstart (. Phoenicurus phoenicurus ), whereas the eggs of P. 0.
gibr altar iensis are white. When comparing the male P. 0. rufiventris with
P. 0. phoenicuroides , the former is black above with the wings black
whereas the latter is a lighter black above with the wings shading to
brown. In the hens the distinction is just as pronounced, the medium
brown above and lighter brown beneath of rufiventris comparing with
a light brown above and even lighter brown beneath of phoenicuroides.
Our first pair of Indian Black Redstarts were purchased late in 1962
and were separately caged in a birdroom until the middle of April,
1963, when they were released into a small brick-built and badly-
lighted little aviary, if you could call it such. Two nest-boxes were
placed high up--one a half-open fronted cardboard box and the other
a wooden lovebird nest-box with a inch diameter entrance hole.
The hen was not seen carrying nesting material until 23rd June, 1963,
and a check showed she was building a deep unlined cup of grasses j
in the cardboard box. On 30th June the hen was off the nest, which
was again checked to reveal two eggs. A third, broken, was on
the floor. On 3rd July another check still showed two eggs. A chick
was hatched on 12th July. Ants' eggs, small mealworms, and gentles
were fed as well as the usual insectivorous food. On 21st July a dead
chick was found near the door of the aviary and at the first opportunity
the nest was checked to find a second young bird within, but this time
very much alive. On 28th July there was no sign of this bird leaving
the nest and as live food consumption had dropped and neither parent
had been seen to carry food to the nest it was examined and a dead
youngster was found inside. It was fully fledged and had probably
died the previous day. From the dull light reddish colour of the

feathers covering the abdomen it was thought to have been a cock.
No further nesting attempt was made that year.
In 1964, after wintering in a birdroom, the pair were again placed
in the same aviary. They nested in early June ; there were two eggs
on 7th June and on 19th June it was suspected that one or more had
hatched out, and unlimited live food was given. On 21st June shell
fragments were seen on the floor. When the hen was off the nest it
was examined, to find three eggs only ! On 2nd July the three light
greeny-blue eggs, which were clear, were removed. On 7th July the
hen was seen building a new nest--this time in the lovebird nest-box.
On 21 st July there was one egg, but it was cold and the nest had the
appearance of being abandoned. This finished the breeding attempts
for 1964.
After caging separately in the birdroom for the winter, they were
again placed in the same brick aviary in the spring of 1965, but on
27th May the cock was picked up dead ; there was no sign of illness
or injury. The hen seemed quite fit but she too died in a cage the
following winter.
Our second pair of Indian Black Redstarts were purchased from
two dealers in November, 1965. Both dealers were importing from
Calcutta and after checking skins at the Natural History Museum
1 have no doubt that this pair, like our first, are P. 0. rufiventris. The
pair were in very rough feather and poor condition and were caged
together in the birdroom for the winter. In April, 1966, they were
placed in a planted aviary to themselves as by this time we had
decided to abandon the little brick aviary previously used. They
quickly settled down and had, before we released them into the aviary,
improved in condition to give us hopes that the pair would breed
before the summer had passed. Various nest-boxes were placed in the
aviary high up. However, in the far better conditions given to this
second pair, no breeding attempt was made in 1966, so in October
they were caged separately in the birdroom. We now felt that a
planted aviary was even more unsuitable for this species than the
little brick aviary mentioned earlier, so when the spring of 1967 came
round we placed the birds in a third aviary measuring 6 feet by
2 ft. 6 in. by 6 ft. 6 in. high with a shelter at one end and a sandy
earth floor growing the odd tuft of grass. Opposite the shelter grows
a Russian Vine which spreads through the netting and over the roof
and requires constant trimming. Towering over this little aviary is
a 20 feet high cobnut tree and an even higher silver birch so altogether
it is a very shady place. High up in the shelter were placed two
nest-boxes, one half-open fronted and the other with a 2 \ inch entrance
hole in an otherwise closed box with sloping roofs. The pair were fed
insectivorous food plus gentles and a few mealworms twice daily.
As the weeks passed there was no sign of breeding activity and we

were beginning to think that the aviary was again unsuitable, when
in the afternoon of 15th June we saw eggshells and one chick dead
in shell, all on the floor of the shelter. The shell fragments were a pale
greeny-blue and added up to probably two or three eggs in total. The
chick or chicks were either hatched that morning or late the previous
day. Gentles and mealworms were now given ad lib and as many as
possible of the latter were soft-skinned. We had no live ants' eggs.
Consumption of mealworms was, however, very low and even up to
the tenth day after hatching the daily requirement did not exceed
thirty. On that day, when the hen was off the nest, I reached up and
could just feel one or two chicks in a deep cup in the half-open-fronted
box. In view of the low mealworm consumption it was a relief to know
that at least one young bird was alive ! I checked again on 30th June
and was now satisfied there was only one chick which seemed fully
fledged and large enough to leave the nest, which it did the next
morning, the seventeenth or eighteenth day after hatching. It was a
large bird and kept to the floor for the next three or four days.
However, just when I was beginning to wonder if there was anything
wrong with its feet it started to perch high up. I felt that the parents
were not feeding it sufficiently so I placed a mixed food pot on the
floor. In minutes I saw it pick up and swallow a gentle and from then
on it flew well and perched as high as its parents. The hen was seen
to feed it on 6th July and again two days later. I removed it from
the aviary on 12 th July as it was now ignored by its parents and there
was a risk they would go to nest again. The young bird was caged
for two weeks and gradually " meated-off " on to insectivorous food
with a minimum of live food before it was placed in a little aviary to
itself. It is very fond of spiders and makes short work of any dropped
in its flight. I am sure it is a hen. At the time it left the nest it had
a short rufous tail, the flight feathers were a dark reddish-brown, and
the back and head a medium brown. The chest was pale brown and
the remaining underparts much paler. To-day, 2nd August, the tail
has grown to about 2 inches and the chest and underparts have evened
up in colour to a dull light brown. The legs and feet are black. The
parents have not gone to nest again and look as if they are about
to moult.
As described, Mrs. Scamell has bred the Indian Black Redstart
(Phoenicurus ochrurus ruftventirs). It is believed that this may be a first
success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this species
in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communicate at
once with the Hon. Secretary.

(Tymphanuchus cupido pinnatus)
By W. A. Newlands (Eley Game Advisory Station, Fordingbridge,
Hants., England)
Among the most fascinating and well-documented of the numerous
species of gamebirds in North America is the Pinnated Grouse, always
referred to in its native States as the Prairie Chicken. There were
formerly three sub-species, but the extinction in 1931 of the Heath Hen
(T. cupido cupido) of the Atlantic coast barrens, left only the Greater
Prairie Chicken, with which we are concerned here, and the Attwater's
Prairie Chicken ( 7 *. c. attwateri) of south-eastern Texas. A second
closely-related species is the Lesser Prairie Chicken ( Tympanuchus
pallidicinctus) which inhabits a narrow area of north-west Texas,
Oklahoma, and Western Kansas.
All these birds inhabit America's open heaths and prairies, and at
one period in the late 1800s they were the most abundant upland
gamebirds on the Continent. The spread of corn growing helped them
greatly in the early stages of breaking-up the prairie, providing food
and cover. However, when the proportion of virgin grassland fell below
40 per cent or so, the Prairie Chickens went into decline. By 1907, for
example, Missouri had to close its annual shooting season on these
grassland grouse and it has never been reopened. Shooting was not
the cause of the trouble, as continued decreases in numbers have shown,
and even the abandonment of much grain-growing land has not helped
the birds. In most States throughout their former wide range, the
Prairie Chickens have either disappeared or been reduced to remnants
living in reserves containing some of the few remaining areas of true
prairie grassland.
In 1963, a Grouse Management Symposium published by the
Journal of Wildlife Management, reported : " The ranges of both
Greater and Lesser Prairie Chickens have been drastically reduced,
largely because the original natural grassland habitats have been
eliminated. Both species now occur only locally throughout their
formerly extensive ranges."
The Greater Prairie Chicken is a most interesting gamebird, with a
display which has few equals among birds of this type. The cocks
weigh about 1,000 g. and hens 850 g. In brief, the description of this
grouse might be given as similar to the European Greyhen, but this is
misleading to a certain extent because the warmth of brown colouring
and intricate barring of the plumage are hardly conveyed by such an
outline. However, the Prairie Chicken is a true grouse, with the stocky
shape of its European relations, feathered legs, and wattles above the

W. A. NEWLANDS-BREEDING THE PINNATED GROUSE
eye of the male. Adult males and females are quite readily dis-
tinguished, the former having long pinnae feathers on the neck,
concealing a bare patch of wrinkled orange-yellow skin on each side.
In the female, the pinnae are short and comparatively inconspicuous.
In young birds, the sexes can be distinguished as the adult tail feathers
moult in, these being solid black in the males, barred with buff in the
females.
At a distance the sexes appear similar, except during the breeding
season, when the cock birds put on a spectacular performance on
" booming grounds ", the equivalent of our blackcock's lek. Males
gather on some open area of grass, starting before sunrise, and each
occupies a small territory on the booming ground. The birds go
through a series of pattering dances, then inflate the neck sacs--bright
orange and about the size of a tennis ball--following this with a noise
resembling " ooooo-oo-ooom " ; rather like the sound made by
blowing over the neck of a large bottle. This booming has the strange
qualities associated with other low notes when uttered in very open
areas : it does not seem to be very loud when heard close at hand, and
yet it carries for long distances. The booming of a group of ten to
fifteen Prairie Chickens can be heard for over a mile on a still morning.
Sometimes the boom is followed by a wild cackle.
Each cock performs individually, usually ignoring his neighbours.
The whole dance-boom-cackle process takes less than four seconds, but
it is repeated without pause for several hours at a time.
The act begins with a short run forward, then the cock stops abruptly,
stamps hard on the ground with a noise like fingertips drumming on
a table-top, turning in a half-circle as he does so. Meanwhile, the
pinnae are erected like ears, joining to form a single " crown " over the
head and the clear yellow wattles become more prominent. The tail
is also erect, showing white underneath, and the primary feathers are
half-spread down towards the ground. The boom is uttered, the sac
deflates, and the cock may leap up with a cackling " kek, kek, kek ".
Sham fights occur on the booming ground, but there is little real strife.
Hens join the cocks on the booming ground in late March or early
April, but do not show much interest. However, they later pass
through the younger, weaker cocks on the perimeter of the booming
ground and mate with one of the dominant males in the centre.
The Prairie Chickens boom morning and evening in March-June
and again in September-November, with lower intensity in the
autumn. The birds seem to be remarkably unaffected by predators or
disturbance during their displays, although they would appear to be
so vulnerable. During a study in Wisconsin, a total of 4,745 morning
watches was arranged at booming grounds and only three cocks were
seen to be killed by predators--two by large owls and one by a harrier.
During a visit to Britain in 1964, Mr. Charles Schwartz, of the

Missouri Conservation Commission, mentioned his work with the
Prairie Chicken to fellow game biologists in this country and arrange-
ments were made for the importation of a small number of eggs in 1965.
These were brought in with the co-operation of Mr. P. J. F. Enderby,
of the West of England Conservation Society, Swindon, Wiltshire.
Twenty-four eggs were imported, great care being taken with their
transport in several types of aircraft and even a sports car ! Sixteen
eggs were sent to other helpers in the project (all of which failed to
produce viable young) and eight were brought to the writer at the
Eley Game Advisory Station, Fordingbridge, Hampshire. All eight
hatched, despite the fact that the first bantam under which they had
been rather hurriedly set on 17th May, stood up at eight days. On
12th June, after twenty-five full days of incubation, the brood emerged
and were transferred to a 1 o by 5 feet movable pen on the lawn of my
home. The pen was of the type known to game-farmers as an
" Andover 55 pen, commonly used for rearing grey partridges. This
pen has no coop, but solid sides and covered ends, only the central
roof of the pen being of wire netting. One of the ends is covered with
transparent plastic, allowing sunlight to reach a dusting tray which
extends for the full width of the pen. Years of study with partridges
have shown that the dry conditions offered by this type of pen will
allow a bantam to rear, on average, fourteen out of fifteen chicks to
sexable age (twelve weeks), even in wet summers when the wild
parents are losing nine-tenths of their offspring.
The main colour of the Prairie Chicken chicks was bright golden
yellow, with russet brown markings on the back. Their feet and legs
were a particularly clear shade of what can only be described as golden
pink, with a fuzz of very bright yellow down on the front of the legs.
The main impression was of a big-footed, big-eyed chick, with much
more golden down than any other gamebird, at least on the British
list. The piping note of the chicks resembled that of a very distant
oyster-catcher.
The young birds tended to look upwards for food, examining the
underside of every blade of tall grass with tilted heads. All game food
crumbs were ignored. Lack of keenness among the chicks prompted a
hurried search for more attractive food and this was obtained by
placing a white sheet under the edge of nearby beds of nettles and under
hedges, knocking out live-food in variety with a big stick ! This produced
the desired effect, with all eight chicks feeding at once--but it was a
full-time job.
Gradually, however, the young birds were persuaded to take
maggots coated in a vitamin/mineral mixture and later mealworms.
Water was another problem. American sources said that the chicks
would ignore surface water and this proved to be the case. At first, the
use of a hand-sprayer provided " dewdrops " on bunches of cut grass,

but later a jam-jar was placed on the wire roof of the pen with a strip
of terry-towelling (about S of an inch wide) dangling from the water in
the jar down to a point about 2 inches above the ground. This provided
a drip a second when the jar was full, falling off in a few hours to a
drip every 15-20 seconds. The bright droplet invariably drew the eyes
of the chicks and solved the difficulty very satisfactorily.
By the third day the chicks were on to their basic rearing diet :
mealworms covered in " Stimulite " canary rearing food, maggots
kept in the same food, and turf ants' nests (ants, pupae and all). An
attempt was made to introduce wood ant pupae, but although these
were quickly eaten, the few remaining ants in the debris of the nest
were so alarming for the tiny chicks that they refused to go near the
proferred pupae. By this stage, the chicks would eat readily from dishes
on the ground, although they preferred to climb among clumps of
cocksfoot, turves of which had been introduced to the pen for their
amusement. They clambered up through the grass, their big feet
reminding the observer of moorhens in the reeds. The brood had been
confined in one end of the pen for two days, by means of a partition.
This was removed on the third day and they kept close to the bantam,
so it was not replaced.
On the fourth day the weather, previously dry and sunny, turned
cold and wet and one chick died, apparently of chilling. Management
continued as before, with the addition of " Multivitamin " to the
water. The pen was moved to fresh ground for the first time on the
sixth day. All food was still being shared by the broody bantam,
although her taste for mealworms was becoming expensive.
By the seventh day the birds were becoming well feathered, particu-
larly on the wings, with heavily barred juvenile secondaries and wing
coverts. When they flapped in exercise, they rose off the ground. At
this point, a reference was found to the U.S. practice of feeding meal-
worms dipped in egg yolk and " crumbed " with gamebird starter.
This sounded ideal, but the source neglected to mention that meal-
worms die instantly--or at least become completely immobile--if
dipped in egg yolk. The " crumbed " mealworms lay motionless in
the pen and were ignored. If the tail end only was dipped, the larvae
remained alive and were eaten. This process was elaborate and time-
consuming, so it was dropped.
There were still some worries about deficiencies in the basic maggot/
mealworm diet, most of the additives being rubbed off before the
chicks consumed the larvae. For this reason Phillips Yeast Mixture
was added to the list of proprietary products in the armoury and it
was found to adhere particularly well to the maggots.
By the thirteenth day the chicks were strong on the wing. One
escaped when startled by a wood ant among some pupae being placed
in the pen. I was away from home at the time and my wife (only a

month away from giving birth to our third child herself) managed to
capture the escapee in the herbaceous border after a 2^-hour stalk !
On the fourteenth day, the first greenstuff was being eaten--mainly
chopped lettuce and dandelion, with some white clover. There was
a break in available supplies of mealworms at this time, so the diet
of maggots and turf ants was varied with moths caught in a light trap
set overnight. Long, stringy dandelion shoots had an almost fatal
fascination for the chicks and they would choke down stalks as long as
their own bodies, if the greens were offered unchopped. By the six-
teenth day, the broody's taste for mealworms had become prohibitive
and she was confined behind 2-inch mesh wire-netting in one end of the
pen, which was now being moved daily on to fresh ground. Pheasant
starter was left before the foster-mother all the time so that she could
encourage the Prairie Chickens to eat it. The young birds were very
even in development at sixteen days, with no runts and no particularly
large poults. Shortly after this, however, one chick went into a long
decline, being culled at the age of three weeks and four days. A post-
mortem by Mr. T. H. Blank, Biologist at the Eley Game Advisory
Station, revealed traces of blackhead and the poults were put on a six-
day-course of " Emtryl ".
At four weeks the first signs of the booming dance behaviour were
noted, with two little poults, presumably cocks, standing face to face,
tails fanned erect and patches of bare skin (pink at this age) showing on
the neck. Five days later a young cock was seen " dancing ", following
the entire pattern of the adult display--quick run, stop, patter in
semi-circle, stop, " boom " (silent in the juvenile) and jump aside,
lowering pinnae and tail.
At 5^ weeks, the birds were very tame, feeding from the hand and
looking very attractive with russet crowns rather reminiscent of
Erckel's Francolin. They were jugging separately from the bantam by
this time (six weeks) and when she laid her first post-broody egg she
was removed. A week later the young cocks were displaying frequently,
their pinnae feathers showing more prominently. The skin at the sides
of the neck was bright purplish-red by seven weeks, but still not
inflated and the display remained silent. This proved to be the case
right through until the spring of 1966.
By seven weeks the brood was weaned on to game starter crumbs
with generous amounts of lettuce and clover. The quality of white
clover seemed to be important and it was helpful that this grew freely
on the lawn--which was now looking very disreputable and over-
grown ! At each daily move on to fresh ground, the previous site would
be found to have several juvenile flight feathers lying about and the
moult was proceeding very quickly.
The number of birds was reduced from six to five when an over-
helpful neighbour moved the pen in my absence, crushing one poult,

which proved on post-mortem to be a healthy male. The alarm shown
by the five Prairie Chickens on 16th August when a telephone linesman
was working at the top of a nearby telegraph pole was interesting.
When frightened they stood very erect, remaining almost motionless for
nearly an hour. This was preceded by some anxious patrolling of the
pen, bodies drawn up into a tall, slim shape and tails flicking nervously
downward. When the poults were merely curious, the feathers of the
head and tail were erect.
On 29th August, another poult died of blackhead. Unfortunately
no precautionary doses of " Emtryl " had been administered since the
earlier course of treatment, the birds all appearing to be healthy. The
disease struck this bird down without any warning and at first it was
thought to be the victim of a night fright. Post-mortem revealed the
infection and also showed the poult to be another male. At thirteen
weeks the tail feathers were all shed within a few days, leaving the
Prairie Chickens looking extremely " stumpy ", but when the new
feathers appeared they were sexable, the two males showing orange
markings on the pinnae and dark outer tail feathers (no barring). By
fifteen weeks all the pale shafted juvenile feathers of the dorsal area
had been moulted out. Body plumage is mature by this age, although
pinnae are short in males and tails are not complete.
On 20th September, at the age of fifteen weeks, the birds were
moved from the small rearing pen to a permanent 30 by 10 feet pen
erected on rough grassland at Fordingbridge. The birds were ap-
parently quite tame and the risk of moving them in an unpadded
wooden crate seemed acceptable. The 8-mile journey from my
home at Ringwood nearly proved fatal. One cock split his scalp open,
exposing a |-inch wide area of skull. This wound was hurriedly
stitched with black thread and the bird realeased (without any great
hope) into the wintering pen. Primaries of both wings were clipped at
this stage on all four birds. Food was now poultry growers pellets,
wheat, greenfood, and " extras " such as sunflower heads, apples, or
hawthorn berries.
The move made the Prairie Chickens extremely wild, so that they
cowered down at the sight of any visitor, " freezing " in the long grass.
The clipped primaries prevented them from taking wing when ap-
proached but they would leap up with a startling cackling and clucking.
The injured cock gradually recovered and eventually his plumage was
indistinguishable from that of the other male. The two hens and two
cocks lived happily as a " covey ", with no scrapping or fighting of any
kind. This is similar to their form of existence in the wild, with
amicable winter flocks which break up when the males start to display,
the females becoming solitary until they bring off their own broods.
By mid-January the first signs of this spring break-up of the flock
began to appear, one cock rushing at the other when he tried to display.

Snow made the birds uneasy, but they continued to thrive on a simple
diet of growers pellets, wheat, and kale. " Multivitamin 33 was added
to the water daily. On 20th February, the two pairs were separated,
one pair remaining in the 30 by 10 feet pen in which they had all been
wintered and the other two birds being run through into a 20 by 10 feet
pen which had been added alongside.
One cock bird took a particular interest during any visits by my
younger daughter, then aged three, and he would rush up to the wire,
raising his pinnae and tail, and cackling. The neck sacs remained
uninflated, however, and this display proved to be very different from
the full booming performance.
Absence on holiday from 1 st to 16th April prevented me from seeing
the development of the booming display, but on my return both cocks
were in fine fettle, performing freely in the morning and intermittently
throughout the day. Gradually the birds grew used to spectators and
many visitors saw both cocks in full display. On one occasion (5th May)
an entire lecture course of forty-five LG.I. agricultural representatives
lined a steep bank above the breeding pens and the birds displayed for
them, unabashed ! The variety of noises made by the cocks was
extraordinary. A ringing " kow-kow 33 formed part of the display
and they often added the " kaa-kaa, kek-kek-kek 33 of alarm or anger.
They boomed all day throughout May and the performance tailed off
in July. The hens were usually ignored, although the cocks did turn
towards them when they passed close by, booming towards them.
No actual treading was observed.
One hen started to lay early in May, the eggs being found under
cover in various parts of the pen. The eggs are similar to those of other
gamebirds in shape, khaki coloured with very slight brown spots. By
22nd May, eighteen eggs had been laid. The first clutch of nine was
put under a broody hen on that date and the second clutch eight days
later. The last egg was laid by the productive Prairie Chicken hen on
27th May (a total of twenty-one eggs). Throughout the laying period
the birds were fed entirely on poultry breeders 3 pellets and greenfood.
On 17th June, after twenty-six days, five chicks emerged from the
first setting of nine eggs. There were three " clear 33 eggs and one dead
in shell, unchipped. Owing to pressure of other work, these chicks were
put on a rather spartan diet--mainly of turf ants and pupae--which
did not seem to agree with them very well. Two died at five days, of
chilling, and this was partly blamed on a very nervous, active broody
hen. She refused to settle on the chicks and on 23rd June (six days old)
the remaining three were found dead.
The following day six further chicks emerged from a setting of
twelve eggs. Three were dead in shell, unchipped, and three " clear 33 .
These chicks were given the elaborate treatment which had been
lavished on the previous year's youngsters and did well from the start.

There were no difficulties with the broody hen, a very tight sitter and
sensible mother, and the brood progressed quickly, although again one
chick was lost to blackhead. The only other rearing loss came at about
nine weeks, when one female poult broke a wing as a result of a night
fright. The damage was severe with bones protruding, and the bird
was destroyed.
The non-laying adult hen had died on 22nd June, post-mortem
examination revealing avian tuberculosis and four pairs of gapeworms
(1 Syngamus trachea ). The bird had appeared in good condition up to the
time of death, but was very light in the hand when picked up dead
(post-mortem weight was 579 g.). On 4th August, the two adult
cocks and one hen were run together in the combined breeding pens
(50 by 10 feet). Later that month, all three birds developed symptoms
of gapes and were put on pellets containing Thibenzole at o - 6 per cent,
which cleared up the trouble. Gapes is a persistent problem at the Game
Advisory Station, where 14 acres of ground have been used intensively
for gamebird propagation work for nearly twenty years. The presence
of numerous diseases is almost a help to anyone working with pheasants
and partridges, but the same could not be said of the more unusual
species !
The three adults and four poults were run together in the large pen
on nth September and a week later they were seen by Mr. G. W.
Schwartz on a visit from Missouri, and Mr. P. J. F. Enderby. On
20th September, Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz and Mr. Enderby joined the
writer in presenting two young Prairie Chicken males to London Zoo.
These were accepted by Mr. J. J. Yealland, Curator of Birds.
At this time, the decision was taken to disperse the stock, owing to
pressure of other work and shortage of pen accommodation urgently
required for work with Japanese green pheasants (Phasianus versicolor)
and other species. One old male and one home-bred young male were
presented to Mr. F. E. B. Johnson, Stagsden, Bedford, and one adult
pair (successful breeders) to Mr. Philip Wayre, Ornamental Pheasant
Trust. Both of the Stagsden birds died within a fortnight and the same
fate overtook the birds at London Zoo, with gapes having recurred in
the latter case. The female presented to the Ornamental Pheasant
Trust also succumbed to an infection (mainly of the air sacs), but the
cock bird survived and is believed to be the only Prairie Chicken in
Europe (or even outside America) at the time of writing (spring, 1967).
The practice of North American game biologists, who have done
some work with Prairie Chickens, is to rear them on wire under brooder
lamps, in some cases using a day-old chick of some other game species
(e.g. Grey Partridge, Perdix perdix) to encourage early acceptance of
crumbed foods. The adult breeders are invariably kept on wire-floors
to eliminate soil-borne diseases. This is similar to the methods now
used in this country and on the Continent by breeders of Grey and

Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris rufa). For the breeder of ornamental
species, however, the artificiality of such penning is obviously un-
desirable and the fact that prairie chickens can be bred successfully by
using modern drugs to keep disease at bay, even on very contaminated
ground, is encouraging.

My pair of Luzon Bleeding-heart Pigeons (Gallicolumba luzonica) were
acquired through a dealer in November of last year, 1966. They were
in poor feather but otherwise good condition, there being no visible
difference between male and female.
For those who have not seen this pretty dove I should note that the
combination of colours is very attractive. The forehead is whitish,
passing to grey on crown ; back is a purplish maroon, upper parts
being grey-brown glossed with metallic green. The wing-coverts have
broad reddish-brown and bluish-grey bars ; the underparts are white.
On the centre of the breast is a blood-red patch which gives the bird
the appearance of having been shot.
In January, 1967, the male was seen displaying to the female. With
quivering wings he would pursue the hen, stopping suddenly to fluff
out his breast feathers and give a rather mournful " Coo". He also
picked up small twigs and these were placed by the hen in typical dove
fashion. A week later two white eggs were found in the seed dish.
These were put under some sitting Cape Turtle Doves, and were
hatched but not fed by their foster parents. A second attempt some
three weeks later, using Senegal Doves as foster parents, alas, had the
same result.
The hen then began to show interest in a 6 inch wooden cube box,
hung about 5 feet from the ground in the aviary shelter. In this she
and the cock bird placed small twigs, roots, and couch grass, and two
eggs again were laid. Incubation lasted about fifteen days, as near
as I could ascertain. Two young hatched, one chick unfortunately
being found dead on the ground after ten days, the other leaving the
nest five days later.
The youngster was well feathered except for the tail and was about
half the size of the parents. Its plumage was generally dull brown
with a dirty-white patch on the breast, no red being visible.
Food supplied was mixed bird-seed, crushed mealies, Sorghum and
sunflower. A piece of moist white bread thrown into the aviary each

evening was taken by the old birds with obvious relish. They were
also seen to eat termites and small wood lice put in for Bishop Birds ;
but as this was only provided about once a fortnight I do not think
live food played much part in rearing.
The young bird is now six months old and beginning to show his
crimson breast. I am hoping that the advent of our rainy season will
bring me more success with these lovely doves.

By Ronald Horsham (Cape Town, South Africa)
Despite all the predictions of disaster from the experts, for twenty
years I have kept my Love-birds on the colony system, running as many
as ioo together in one aviary, but providing them with an adequate
number of nest-boxes. The species treated in this way have been
Peach-faced Love-birds, Masked Love-birds, and Fischer's Love-birds ;
after all these species live in colonies in the wilds and it seems logical
to so keep them in aviaries, providing the aviary is big enough for them.
One of the most exciting things on my recent safari to Angola was to see
and hear the great flocks of Peach-faced Love-birds in Southern Angola
and in the northern part of South-West Africa in Ovamboland.
A certain amount of bickering takes place among my birds, but this
seems to stimulate their breeding and in my experience very rarely
results in bloodshed, and any accidents that may have taken place have
not resulted from the colony system. You can hear these same minor
squabbles among these birds in the wild. Since it is not practical to put
in single nest-boxes for so many birds, mine live in " blocks of flats "
with perhaps six nest-boxes side by side in a several storey block. The
size of this " block-of-flats nest-box " is 3 feet wide and 6 feet deep, but
with the openings on alternate sides from two separate but adjacent
aviaries : that is, the birds in the first aviary will live on the ground,
second, and fourth floors, while in the next door aviary they will live
on the first, third, and fifth floors. As with humans, the flats at the
top of the building are preferred to the ones lower down, but there is
never any serious fighting over this positioning.
The next point, which is the subject of this report, is that ten years
ago I noticed that some of my Fischer's Love-birds had slightly more
orange on the breast than the others and I set my target to breed out
an orange or red Fischer's. For some years I selected these orange birds
and caged them up separately, having about eight or ten birds in a
small colony system aviary. I do not believe in interfering with the
birds unduly and only periodically do I look in the nest-boxes to check
whether mice have become lodgers at the expense of the birds. So
several weeks had elapsed between inspections and when I looked in the

box I was utterly astonished to find one normal green and three blue
chicks : the orange birds had thrown blue youngsters and since that
time I have bred them continuously, to establish what I believe is one
of the only colonies of Blue Fischer's in existence.
The blue birds are very distinct from the Masked Love-birds, being
slightly smaller in build, but having a very pale grey head instead of a
black one, as in the Masked. The shade of blue is slightly different and
can easily be distinguished when a Masked and a Fischer's are com-
pared side by side. They are throwing a high percentage of blues but
I am continuing to breed with the greens as well, for some years ago
I tried the experiment of separating out all the blues and the result was
disastrous, and breeding virtually stopped. My present policy is to
remove a few green Fischer's from the aviaries and to cage them up
separately so that the proportion of blues is constantly increasing. So
far as I know these birds arose from the slightly orange flecked birds
which were direct descendants of wild stock and so far as I know the
blue factor was not introduced through Masked Love-birds or in any
other way.

NEW PENGUIN POOL AT CHESTER ZOO
By M. F. Coupe
During April, 1967, six Rockhopper (Eudyptes crestatus) and six
Jackass (Spheniscus demersus) Penguins arrived at the Zoo. The original
Penguin Island at the Zoo is so large that when these small species
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.990420894736842" page_id="56379258"  page_num="169" year="" vol="">
were introduced they could not be seen properly by members of the
public. It was decided to construct a small pool especially to accom-
modate these twelve new arrivals.
The new pool has been constructed opposite the Bird House Entrance
on part of the old Waterfowl enclosure ; the rest of the area has been
used to construct new accommodation for our Giant Anteaters. The
position of the new pool is of particular importance as Penguins do not
like to be exposed to the full glare of the sun. They are not quite so
vulnerable to heat as many people make out and as long as they have
plenty of fresh, preferably running water, normal British temperatures
are quite acceptable. The new pool faces north, being shaded from the
south by tall trees and receives sunshine only in the early morning
and late evening. A waterfall has been incorporated into the design
and natural sandstone rockwork has been used extensively. The pool
is not large as it was only designed for twelve small Penguins but the
whole effect is very attractive and is very popular with visitors. It has
been designed for ease of maintenance, the pool being drained and
cleaned each morning and refilled with fresh water each day.
The Rockhopper Penguins must be one of the most attractive species

AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOUR IN WREATHED
HORNBILLS AT CHESTER ZOO

By M. F. Coupe
During March, 1966, three Wreathed Hornbills (Rhyticeros dampieri)
arrived at the Zoo in a large consignment from New Britain. Un-
fortunately one of these was in poor condition and finally died after
about a month in the Zoo. The remaining two birds were very strong
and fit and have gradually improved in condition until they are now
first-rate specimens.
The Wreathed Hornbills are housed in the first aviary on the right in
the Temperate Bird House where they make a marvellous show and are
very popular. They are very noisy birds giving vent to loud raucous j
grunts and love to shake their natural branch perches. This makes
them very popular with parties of school children who group around the
aviary shouting at the birds who reciprocate with even louder shouts,
much to the delight of both Hornbills and humans.
When the Hornbills first arrived they were very tame and trusting
but as they became more robust their friendliness turned to aggression.
During late summer and autumn, 1966, this became particularly
noticeable and keepers were unable to enter the aviary without being
attacked. A special trap door was then constructed between the
Hornbills aviary and an outside flight in the original Bird House. The
Hornbills were enticed into the outside flight, the sliding door closed j
and the keepers were then able to enter. Frequently of course we have
to take this type of precaution when dealing with dangerous animals,
but this is the first time that birds have had to be dealt with in this
manner.
When the Hornbills started this aggressive behaviour, notices were
put in position warning members of the public not to get too near the
wire mesh. Strangely enough the Hornbills showed no desire to attack
strangers but a trainee keeper who stood too close to the wire received
rather a nasty black eye.

At the time of writing, the Wreathed Hornbills have settled down and
the trap door is not required--at least for the time being. Members of
the staff are keeping a watchful eye on these birds in case they become
aggressive again this summer. Recently when I stood close to the wire
mesh one of the Hornbills would have attacked me through the wire
had I not moved away quickly--this is definitely a case where famili-
arity breeds contempt.

The Bee-eaters and Paradise Flycatchers show every sign of thriving
in our conditions. So they should, as we are able to supply ample live
food in the form of crickets, blowflies, and locusts and only occasionally
do we need to rely upon mealworms. We have other species of Bee-
eaters on order and intend to concentrate upon the large-scale produc-
tion of blowflies in future using artificial feeding mixtures. Eventually
it is our desire to feed flies in place of maggots throughout the collection,
at least on alternate days.
Although few Kingfishers are to be seen in public collections we
have found them ideal birds for planted compartments. Their feeding
presents no problems as we are fortunate in being able to obtain
supplies of fresh shrimps, small crabs, and whitebait from Morecambe
Bay. In fact we consider Kingfishers such good exhibits that we have
ordered pairs of three other species.

By J. J. Yealland
The early stages of the nesting of a pair of Princess Stephanie's
Birds of Paradise were described in the Avicultural Magazine (vol.
73, 3, pp. 97-8). Early in May an egg was laid and on 28th May
a chick hatched. This bird survived and grew well until 18th June
when it died. I was away in South Africa from 27th April until
23rd June, so have no first-hand knowledge of the events, though
I did see the chick and noticed how strong and well formed the leg
bones were. The male was removed when incubation started, for he
drove the female about whenever she came off the nest and he
appeared to take no part in feeding either her or the chick. In addition
to " insectile " mixture, mealworms rubbed in Scott's emulsion,
maggots, locusts, and flies were supplied.
At the beginning of July the female began building again just above
the first nest but, owing to disturbance, this was abandoned and
another single egg was laid in the old nest on 9th July, incubation
beginning at once, so perhaps the normal clutch is only one egg. The
reunited male had just begun to moult at this time and had shed his
long tail feathers. On 29th July the egg hatched ; the skin of the
young one appears quite blackish. The foods as before are being
offered and in addition some fresh ant cocoons. Abedec is being given
in place of the emulsion and, as before, some bone meal is mixed with
the food. I wish that wasp larvae were obtainable, for this must be
a good and easily-digested food, but my impression is that wasps are
scarce this summer.
The eggs were thickly covered with pale pinkish-buff blotches ;
neither egg was measured. The incubation periods were twenty-one
and nineteen to twenty days respectively.
Among birds bred in the Gardens are two Night Herons, four
Herring Gulls, two Great Black-backed Gulls, four Black Ducks
(: rubripes ), one Laysan Duck, one Barnacle Goose, Silver and Golden
Pheasants, one Tonkinese Junglefowl, three Great, three Spotted and
three Kenya Eagle-Owls, two Crested Pigeons, two Princess of Wales's
Parrakeets, and four Cockatiels. A Javan Fish-Owl has been bred and
this appears to be the first occasion on which this has happened in
captivity, certainly in this country.
Chicks hatched and so far thriving are Sacred Ibises, Cattle Egrets,
a Grey-headed Gallinule, Red-legged Partridges, Common Peafowl,
and a Cloncurry Parrakeet ; chicks hatched but which did not survive
are Black-headed Gulls, Sarus Crane, and Blacksmith Plover. A pair
of Mongolian Larks nested, but hatched nothing. Baillon's Aracaris
nested again in a hollow log and five white eggs were laid, disappearing
as before. Five seems a large clutch, but the birds do appear to be

a pair and not two females, for there is quite a difference in the length
of the bills.
Among the presentations during the period April to August are
seven forms new to the collection, and these are a Chinese Serpent
Eagle [Spilornis cheela ricketti) and two White-breasted Kingfishers of
the race H. s.fusca from Dr. K. C. Searle, who also sent a Green Pea-
fowl, a pair of Palawan Peacock Pheasants, a Grey-backed Thrush,
two Javan Pied Mynas, and four Black-winged Grackles ; an Emerald
Toucanet [Aulacorhynchus prasinus caeruleogularis) from Lady Baillie, who
also gave a Yellow-billed Aaracari, two White-cheeked Turacos, a
Swainson's Lorikeet, and a pair of Indian Ring-necked Parrakeets ;
two Blyth's Lesser Whitethroats [Sylvia curruca blythi ) from Mr. A.
Graystone and two Sardinian Warblers [Sylvia melanocephala) , an
Olivaceous Warbler [Hippolais pallida ), and three of the Moroccan
race of Parus caeruleus , the Ultramarine Tit [ultramarinus) from the
brothers G. H. and J. R. Newmark. Two North American Ruddy
Ducks have been presented by Mr. E. O. Squire who bred them ;
a Black Francolin [Francolinus francolinus) by Miss E. Locker Lampson,
a Rough-legged Buzzard and a Sacred Ibis by Major Aubrey Buxton.
Other arrivals include two young Ostriches, a Gannet and four
Puffins that had been contaminated with oil from the wreck of the
Toney Canyon , three young Scarlet Ibises, four Lesser Flamingos, a
Sclater's Curassow [Crax fasciolata sclateri ), a Venezuelan Wood Rail,
a Sulphur-breasted Toucan, four Purple Honeycreepers, two Crested
Buntings, two Red-billed Oxpeckers, and a Splendid Starling.
A Long-tailed Parrakeet [Psittacula longicauda ) presented in Septem-
ber, 1964, has died. It had been in the previous owner's possession
for two years and, in spite of its comparatively brief life, I believe that
it is a record of longevity for this parrakeet in this country.
As a result of long-needed alterations in the Parrot House by which
all the small cages have been done away with and replaced by flights,
a good deal of mixing has perforce taken place and with very little
in the way of strife so far but, of course, it would be very different if
anything in the way of nesting accommodation was put into the flights.
Some of the birds from this house have been put into recently vacated
outdoor cages at the former Central Mammal House, so the parrot-like
birds are now rather scattered.

readers report that when they move into new council properties they

birds can be recommended as pets. Part of a recent answer is :
" Canaries, Cockatiels, Mynahs, Parrots, and Quaker Parrakeets can
be allowed to fly loose in the room and the last four can be taught to
talk." It is true that some Quaker Parrakeets do learn to speak a little,
but their cries, in which they very frequently indulge, can be almost
unendurable. I am unable to think of any parrakeet I would rather not
have caged in a room.

The so-called Parrot Ban has, of course, been lifted in Great Britain
but not, as yet, in the U.S.A. Ralf H. Masure, writing in the June,
1967, number of American Cage-bird Magazine , asks why the ban has not
been removed there, too. He gives some of the present regulations in
respect of the importation of all psittacine birds into the United
States.
Perhaps the one most difficult to understand, especially by anyone
living on this side of the Atlantic, is that relating to quarantine. It
seems that whereas zoological gardens are allowed to quarantine
imported birds on their own premises for thirty days, the private
person must have the single pair of birds permitted quarantined for
four months. Ralf Masure says : "It doesn't seem logical to require
a four months' quarantine for two birds that will come into contact
with a limited number of other birds, and a very few people, as com-
pared with the zoological park where there would be many birds and
a great number of people in contact with the new arrival."

The letter by John S. Nero, Avicultural Magazine, May-Jime, 1967, was of great
interest to me. However, the trouble of creating monsoon conditions in an aviary could
only be justified if there was a serious conservation problem. Java Sparrows are being
bred from wild-caught stock and far better concentrate in establishing strains bred in
normal aviary conditions.
At present research is being conducted on the reproduction capabilities of British
birds under various conditions. While the provision of a natural environment is an
important factor, the psychological effects of captive conditions may be a far greater

influence in retarding the breeding cycle. Breeding results from wild-caught Java
Sparrows confined to an aviary situated in their natural domain, may be negative.
With aviary-bred British birds there is ample evidence that a change in environment
during the breeding season has an adverse effect on the results, even when the change
is for the better. Changes encountered during the evolution of a species may be
reflected in their ability to more readily reproduce under variable conditions.
Research with wild-caught British birds indicates that over a short period of a
decade the environmental factor declines in its influence as a stimulant to reproduc-
tion. The Japanese breeding stocks of Javas, mostly mutations, are domesticated and
probably are mostly bred indoors ?
Early this year a pair of Mandarin Ducks which had bred the past two seasons, was
moved to a larger enclosure, about 100 feet from their old place. No attempt at
breeding was made and this was attributed to the reproduction mechanism being
" blocked " by the psychological barrier created by the change in environment.
Some species are classed as " easy to breed Here the barrier may have been
broken down by domestication. With some " domesticated " species the barrier is not
only reduced but totally removed with the result that over-breeding takes place.
No doubt the abundance of natural food, together with the photoperiodicity factor
stimulate the breeding cycle, but the change in environment associated with captive
conditions may retard their effect to the extent that no breeding takes place.

The Protection of Birds Bill, 1967, which amends the principal Act
of 1954, was given the Royal assent on 14th July, 1967, and the Act
will become effective on the expiry of six months from that date, on
14th January, 1968.
In a Bill of this nature many interested bodies are consulted and
asked for their recommendations, objections, and criticisms. Foremost
in this connection were the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
(whose President, Col. Sir Tufton Beamish, introduced the Bill into
the House of Commons), the International Council for Bird Preserva-
tion (British Section), the Avicultural Society, and the National
Council of Aviculture.
The Avicultural Society was particularly active in obtaining the
amendment by which licences may be granted for the purpose of
taking wild birds for aviculture. The thanks, not only of the Members
of the Society but of all aviculturists, are due to the Sub-Committee
appointed by the Council of the Avicultural Society--Colin Harrison,
Claude Payne, and Philip Wayre, and to the Rt. Hon. the Earl of
Cranbrook for moving, and securing the adoption of, the amendment.

PROTECTION OF BIRDS BILL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995149925925926" page_id="56379269"  page_num="178" year="" vol="">
Special commendation should be given to W. J. Page, Editor, Cage
and Aviary Birds , who in his pages gave full coverage of every stage of
the Bill, together with explanatory notes.
Definition of the word " aviculture ".
The word " aviculture " was created by the Avicultural Society
when it was first formed, and it is therefore appropriate that we should
define what we mean by this word. The need for such a definition
arose recently when mentioned in the amendment of the new Protec-
tion of Birds Bill, 1967. During discussions of the amendment with
various people the Sub-Committee appointed by the Council of the
Avicultural Society were asked what they meant by the word. Colin
Harrison drew up the following definitions which were approved and
agreed by the Council of the Society, and they are now given for
future guidance.
Aviculture is the keeping and breeding of birds for aesthetic pleasure
and for study under controlled conditions which usually involve
keeping such birds in an enclosure or aviary or cage. The person who
does so is an Aviculturist.
Aviculture does not include the buying and selling of live birds, this
being known as bird-dealing. The person who does so is a bird-dealer.
(, N.B. Most aviculturists who breed birds find it necessary from time to
time to dispose of additional young birds which they cannot accommo-
date, and such minor transactions are not usually regarded as bird-
dealing in the sense in which the term is used here.)
Aviculture does not include the exhibiting of birds for competitive
purposes in shows or exhibitions, this being known as bird-fancying.
The person who does so is a bird-fancier.

(.Amoropsittaca ay mar a)
By A. A. Prestwich (Edenbridge, Kent, England)
Alcide Dessalines d'Orbigny, who travelled so extensively in South
America, 1826-33, and who was the first scientific explorer of Bolivia,
included this species in the valuable collection of about 800 bird-skins
that he brought back for the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. He
described it as Arara aymara . Since then it has been variously included
in the genera Myiopsitta, Bolborhynchus and Conurus. Dr. Charles
Richmond, dealing with a number of preoccupied generic names,
decided that this parrakeet could not be included in Bolborhynchus and
proposed a new genus Amoropsittaca. But lately, R. M. de Schauensee
has relegated it to Bolborhynchus.
This parrakeet is named for the Aymaras, the chief indigenous race of
Peru and Bolivia. The alternative English names Sierra and Andean
refer to its terrain--sierra being the name used in Spain and Spanish
America for a range of mountains and, in this case, specifically the
Andes of Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. Peters gives the range as
" Highlands of Bolivia south through the mountains of Argentina in
provinces of Salta, Catamarca, Tucuman, La Rioja, Mendoza and
Cordoba ; casual (?) in northern Chile ".
All too little has been written about South American parrots and
parrakeets in general, and the present species is no exception. We do,
perhaps, expect too much of mere collectors, as opposed to field-
workers. And really there is very little that even the latter can record
apart from the very trite.
Alexander Wetmore had the good fortune to see these parrakeets in
the wild, and writes : " These little mountain parakeets were recorded
first on March 13, 1921, on the slopes above the city of Mendoza,
when by following back on the line of flight of a small flock we found a
water-hole, perhaps the only one in an otherwise wholly arid tract.
On March 19, near El Salto, at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres
above Potrerillos, Mendoza, these parakeets were common. Here they
ranged over the hills in small bands that fed in berry-bearing bushes, or
descended to search for fallen fruit in the grass below. The birds were

highly social and were found always in parties. Their flight was swift
and direct. Their chattering notes were high-pitched and, at times,
suggested the excited calls of barn swallows. Three were taken. On
March 21, a flock was recorded at an altitude of 1,800 metres near
the hotel at Potrerillos."
But it is to the aviculturist that one must turn for observations, even
if they are made under controlled conditions.
This small parrakeet, scarcely larger than a robust Budgerigar, in
colour strongly resembles the Quaker Parrakeet, but very fortunately it
does not possess its ear-piercing shriek, the call being merely a soft
twitter. Alexander Wetmore has likened it to that of a Barn Swallow
and in this Jorgensen concurs. Dr. Einar Lonnberg has, however,
stated " Occurred at San Luis [near Tarija, in Bolivia] in large flocks,
screaming loudly when flying round ".
The Sierra Parrakeet was first brought alive to England by Gerald
Durrell, in 1959. Durrell writes of the event : " The ones I obtained
(eight in all) were purchased in the bird-market at Mendoza
(Argentina), in the foothills of the Andes. There was such a vast
quantity on sale that I thought, in my ignorance, that they must surely
have been exported to Europe, and so I only purchased the eight. If I
had realized they were something unusual, I would have brought back
many more. They are apparently a fairly popular pet in that part of
the Argentine and, judging by the quantity on sale, I would say a
reasonably common species."
One of DurrelPs original birds went to the London Zoo where it is
still to be seen in the Parrot House (April, 1967). It soon became tame
and is of a quiet and gentle demeanour. It must surely be the sole
survivor.
During the winter of 1961-62 quite a large number were available
in the Continental markets. It was only natural that a few pairs should
eventually arrive in England.
During the 1962 breeding season A. V. Marques successfully reared
one young one ; and in mid-September K. Russell reported three
young in the nest, but very unfortunately they were not reared, due to
rain penetrating the nest-box. Russell was, however, fully successful in
1 963, writing : "A pair laid eight eggs in a clutch, and hatched and
reared six youngsters, all of which are good birds. They are quite
hardy, and the adults have wintered out, using the nest-box as a
dormitory."
Complete success was obtained at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm in
1964. W. D. Cummings, writes : " We reared a brood of five little
Andean (Aymara) Parrakeets and are building up a nice breeding
stock of these delightful birds. They are easier to sex as they come out
of the nest because the cocks have distinctive silver breasts and darker
caps. They come out of the nest in adult plumage and only differ in

size from the adults. We had a spare hen of this species, which we
successfully paired to a green Budgerigar cock ; they mated and laid
but, as expected, the eggs were all infertile." Russell confirms the
sexing of the young, writing that the cocks have " darker heads and
more silver throats than the hens ".
C. D. Beckett was also successful in 1964. Seven eggs were laid and as
there was no result after twenty-four days incubation they were re-
moved for testing in warm water. There being no sign of movement
one of the eggs was broken open when it was found to contain a three-
parts formed chick. Beckett writes : " I hastily returned the remaining
six eggs to the nest and the hen took possession of them at once. On
12th July--28 days after the first egg was laid--to my great delight
a chick appeared, followed at two-day intervals by three more."
The young ones were ten weeks old at the time of the account.
Denmark. Sv. E. Jorgensen, Maribo, was successful in 1964. In the
autumn 1963, he obtained a pair that had already hatched two young
ones, which died after a couple of days. During the winter and spring
Jorgensen conditioned them to their future surroundings and during the
second week of May seven eggs were laid. Six young were hatched and
fully reared, leaving the nest-box 16th to 20th July. The seventh egg
proved to be infertile.
U.S.A. Kenton G. Lint, Curator of Birds, Zoological Society of
San Diego, California, lists this species amongst those bred there.
Food. This parrakeet seems to be extraordinarily fond of sunflower
seed and, in fact, is quite prepared to subsist on this seed alone--it
certainly appears to do it no harm. Some prefer the black to the white
variety. Canary and millet should also be provided, as well as a very
limited quantity of hemp. Millet spray is a welcome addition. All the
usual green foods--lettuce, groundsel, dandelion--should be offered,
some show a particular liking for the large, fleshy stems of spinach-beet,
carrot and, of course, soft, sweet apple.
Nest-boxes. A nest-box of a somewhat similar size to that usually
supplied to lovebirds is suitable, approximately 8 by 8 inches and
9 inches deep, internal measurements. The bottom should have about
two inches of peat, leaf mould, decaying wood, etc.
For their amusement a supply of non-poisonous twigs or branches
should be provided ; favourites are willow, hazel, ash, poplar, fruit
trees, etc. Pieces of the bark are certain to be carried into the nest-box.
Sexing. Sexing these parrakeets may present some difficulty to the
novice as the colouring of the two sexes is almost identical. The
experienced aviculturist should, however, be able to recognize a male
by its slightly finer and flatter head ; in addition, the whitish-grey
colour of the throat and breast appears to be rather lighter and brighter.
There seems to be much to recommend this newcomer to the avi-
cultural scene. While it is somewhat soberly coloured it is, nevertheless,

SIERRA PARAKEETS-- A NEW CHALLENGE
By Kenton G. Lint (Curator of Birds, San Diego Zoo)
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.9797353" page_id="56379285"  page_num="182" year="" vol="">
San Diego's breeding pair of Sierra Parakeets was received from
Antwerp, Belgium, on 29th April, 1964, and the birds were exhibited
in several zoo locations during 1965. In the effort to keep abreast of
a progressive established breeding programme, we encourage new
species to propagate each year. Early in 1966, these parakeets were
moved to one of the regular breeding aviaries where they would not
be disturbed.
The breeding aviaries, all located outdoors, measure 10 feet long,
6 feet wide, and 7 feet high. At one end of this flight area, a wooden
nesting-box (10 inches deep by 7 inches wide, with a 4 inch opening
at the front) was hung under cover about 5 feet from the ground.
It was filled to a depth of 3 to 4 inches with finely shredded wood
shavings.
The birds took possession of the box almost immediately and slept
in it every night. We believe the first egg was laid on 10th April, and
the fourth egg on 16th April, with two-day intervals between each egg.
On the latter day, incubation evidently commenced as the hen
remained in the nest all day, leaving it late in the evening to visit the
feeding tray and the water container. The male took no part in the
incubation but guarded the hen by roosting on top of the nest-box.

Sexes are almost identical in coloration, with dull green on the upper parts and pale grey
below. The crown of the head is a dark greyish-brown on both birds. The cock {left) has
a finer and flatter head than the hen [right). The male's bill is white, the females has a
tinge of blue.

Most parrots and parakeets produce mouse-like squeaks soon after
emerging from the shell, calling for food from the parents. We waited
for a vocal indication from the expected hatchlings, as we did not
wish to disturb nesting activities. No information is available about
the true incubation period of this species as breeding records have not
been published in the Western Hemisphere. After waiting thirty days,
I decided to take a peek into the nest-box. When the hinged top was
opened quietly, the hen continued to sit tightly. Then she raised her
body slightly and I saw a small white head under the breast. In
correspondence with Mr. Russell, I learned that the chicks are covered
with cotton-white down for a period of four days. Then the down
gradually turns to grey. We believe the single chick was hatched on
14th May, 1966. The three remaining eggs were infertile.
The growth and development of our prize seemed extremely slow
compared to grass parakeets of similar size. For three weeks, the
downy feathers showed little change, only becoming darker in colour.
The fourth week, pin feathers appeared in the occipital regions.
When five weeks old, the ventral, femoral, and humeral tracts had
begun to feather out. The tail pin feathers, encased in their sheaths,
measured four inches in length when the chick was six weeks old.
Patches of grey downy feathers were still conspicuous on the neck,
back, and rump.
When the bird was seven weeks old, we decided to remove it from
the parents and rear it by hand on our regular psittacine chick formula.
(By removing the chick at this age, we hoped the pair would re-nest
and probably hatch a larger brood in the second breeding cycle.)
The chick was carefully transferred into a small brooder and placed
on a regular feeding schedule--8 a.m., 12 noon, and 5 p.m. daily.
The nestling was an exact replica of the parent birds in plumage
except for a shorter tail at the time it was moved.
At eight weeks of age, the bird would eat a small amount of mixed
formula from the container placed in the brooder. This was supple-
mented by hand feeding, until ten weeks of age, when normal feeding
by itself was observed on schedule.
It has been a pleasure to work with this attractive member of the
parrot family and have it reproduce in captivity. These parakeets
are very easy to care for as they seem to live well on little else than
sunflower seed, although canary seed and millet are also taken, as
well as most of the usual greens in small amounts, such as lettuce and
celery tips. They show a particular liking for small pieces of fresh
apple. It is hoped that our notes will stimulate further interest in this
species and will also serve as an introduction to a lovely, unusual
South American parakeet.

Larger than cock, with the throat and middle of breast black, the

and cheeks are spotted with light grey. Colour of bill, legs, feet, and

Hemipodes or Button Quails ( Turnicidae ).
Details of Individuals and Breeding
A cock T. suscitator was purchased in May, 1966. Attempts to obtain
further specimens resulted in the reception of several pairs of Coturnix
advertised as " Button Quail Finally an advertisement offering
Button Quail within the London area seemed to be the answer. On
arriving at the vendor's premises on 23rd May, 1967, I saw to my great
relief about twenty-five T. suscitator among a mixed group of Coturnix
and Perdicula. The proprietor was most helpful, allowing me to enter
the aviary containing this " flock ", with the intention of securing a
cock and two hens. This was not easy, as the plumage of most of the
birds was in poor condition and the size factor can be unreliable as
a method of determining sex. After comparison of size in the hand I
left with two hens and a " cock ", although somewhat concerned that
the much smaller " cock " had a very strongly made bill for " his " sex.
These birds proved to be three hens, which will be referred to as

The cock bird received in May, 1966, was released into a 12 by 8 by
10 feet aviary on 20th May, 1967. What appeared to be the fittest hen

the aviary with the cock on 31st May. They immediately began to
mutual preen and clump together. On 10th June an egg was laid in a
cave-like nest at the base of a thick pile of dead weeds. Both birds kept
returning to this site, first the cock would enter, sit in the nest and pull
stems around him with a sharp backward jerk, the hen standing a few
inches away making similar movements with imaginary stems, some-
times pulling real stems to the nest. This situation was then reversed,
with the hen in the nest and the cock standing near the site. It was
noticeable that the cock was stem pulling more frequently with real
stems. A second egg was laid on the nth, a third on the 12th, and a
fourth on the 13th. The cock began incubation and some stems were
pulled out from the pile just above the nest, jutting out like a canopy.
Later these stems were pulled down, until the sitting bird was almost
obscured.
During incubation the hen sometimes stood near the nest in an
aimless manner. Assumedly in the wild she would have courted another
cock by this time and laid a second clutch. When the cock left the nest
to feed, she would sometimes follow him for a while, but did not join
him when he had a quick dust bath. The eggs hatched at about
4 p.m. on the 26th, the hen stood near the site. She made a half-
hearted forward threat at a Quail Finch who was pecking at a portion
of eggshell which appeared at the end of the " canopy ". The cock was
still brooding the chicks in the nest on the morning of the 27th. They
left the nest at about 8 a.m. leaving one unhatched egg which proved to
be clear. When I entered the aviary the cock made a forward threat in
my direction. The chicks were about the size of Excalfactoria chicks,
brown above with darker streaks, underparts light brown. They were
very light, almost cream colour in the facial area, with a single dark
" stripe " from crown to bill, their bill was dark horn in colour, the
legs and feet were a light fleshy colour, the iris brown.
The hen " A " took no part in the rearing of the chicks, even moving
away from the cock when he attempted to clump with her. I had a
feeling that she could no longer be trusted, so she was removed from
the aviary on 2nd July. The following list gives some idea of the chicks'

The eggs were short ovates of a light stone ground colour, blotched
and spotted with dark brown and a few spots of purplish-red. The only
egg measured was 23 *5 by 18-5 mm. During the breeding they shared
the aviary with Quail Finches ( Ortygospiza articollis) , Red-crested
Finches ( Coryphospingus cristatus) , Pin-tailed Nonpareils (. Erthyura
prasina ), and Crested Black Buntings ( Melophus lathami), one pair of
each species.
A second clutch of four eggs was laid by hen 44 B 53 . These were
found scattered and broken after the cock had incubated them for five
days. At the time of writing (22nd August), the cock is sitting on a
third clutch of four eggs. Both these clutches were approximately the
same size and shape as those laid by hen 44 A 55 . These eggs, unlike
those of hen 44 A ", were a fawn ground colour, heavily marked with
dark brown blotches, mostly at the larger end.
Food
Mostly millet and a little maw is taken, sometimes chick-crumbs, all
live food is taken with relish. When the adult birds were first received,
they were protein starved and emptied maggot trays at an alarming
rate. For the first ten days the chicks seemed to take only live food and
tiny pieces of green food. Three large maggot trays were kept full and
privet bushes were shaken vigorously into a tin. This produced a good
44 crop 53 of small spiders, etc., which were tipped into the aviary. The
cock was surprisingly adept at catching sluggish, and sometimes not so
sluggish, flies. This food source was a result of the considerable maggot
44 spillage 33 from the trays.

General Characteristics and Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999461962962963" page_id="56379292"  page_num="187" year="" vol="">
Normal locomotion is a brisk rather 44 pigeon-like " walk with the
head nodding forward in rhythm. They pause at frequent intervals to
give a vigorous 44 left-right " bill wipe on the ground, with the lateral
surfaces of the bill. On one occasion the cock found food for the
chicks by disturbing loose soil with a bill wipe, instead of the usual
44 peck-dig ". They seek hard ground for dust bathing and scuffle in a
hurried manner, with feathers fluffed out. This scuffling is inter-
spersed with rubbing movements of alternate sides of the head and
body.
When drinking they gently dip the bill just below the water surface,
the head is then raised to the 44 normal " position, drinking by
44 sucking ". Once hen 44 A " was seen to dip very quickly and raise
the head above the normal position, drinking by 44 scooping ",
Goodwin (1965).
During sun-bathing the pair would sit in close proximity, sometimes
fully opening both wings simultaneously, so that the dorsal surfaces

bond seemed strong, mutual preening and clumping frequently during
the day. Dust and sun-bathing were 44 social " and the pair roosted in
the clumped position.
I was perhaps too hasty in removing hen 44 A " on 2nd July, but the
strongly made bill of the hen looked a formidable weapon. The
expected amazonian behaviour occurred when hen 44 B " scalped and
killed hen 44 C " on 9th July. They were housed together in a box
cage 40 by 20 by 15 inches, all was well at approximately 12 noon, at
12.45 p.m. hen 44 C " was dead. Prior to this time, all had seemed well,

" social " dust-bathing. Hen " A " was housed in a cage on the
opposite side of the bird room when she was removed from the aviary.
I suppose the theory that some vocal or visual " stimulus " from her
triggered off this killing, could be considered.
On several occasions hen " B " was seen to tit-bit the cock,
Harrison (1965). When she found an insect, she would " freeze " with
the head lowered and the bill near the ground. The offering would
be presented to the cock on the bill-tip, in the same manner as he
presented food to the chicks. She would stay in this posture with her
insignificant tail quivering rapidly up and down, until the cock took
the offering. This posture was accompanied by a barely audible
vocalization.
Egg-rolling behaviour has been observed, hen " B ". During the
laying of the third clutch, an egg was deposited about 14 inches
from the nest. I picked it up and placed it in the nest, then watched
through the window of a shed which is very conveniently placed for
observations on this aviary. Within five minutes the hen walked to
the nest and rolled out the egg, using the underside of the bill but not
tucking the egg between the thighs. She then rolled the egg rapidly to
approximately the same place as it was when I picked it up. The hen
moving backwards and rolling the egg with bill strokes, the motive
power being the head and neck. The only bird-egg contact was the
bill, which provided both " drive " and " guide 55 . This differs in
one physical aspect from the egg-rolling behaviour of Excalfactoria
chinensis , which " controls " or " guides " the egg with the thighs,
Harrison et. al. (1965). This "procedure" was then repeated, the
egg being replaced in the nest and the hen rolling it to approximately
the same place as before and about the same distance. It would be
interesting to know if tit-bitting or egg-rolling behaviour has been
previously observed in T. suscitator or its congenerics.

By J. Alan Burdick (Research Associate, Bureau of Research in
Neurology and Psychiatry, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A.)
The breeding of hybrids is an interesting hobby and there are few
of us who have not attempted " crosses 55 at one time or another.
Lately I decided that I wanted to do a " new " hybrid and went to
the literature to find out what has been done. Two major facts
became apparent : (i) The " news " of hybridization is not easily
available ; (2) There is a gap between the zoologist and the general
bird breeder which could be bridged by a more systematic report on
the part of the breeder. The aim of this paper is to present some
information of what has been done, to outline a method of literature
search, and to discuss the scientific importance of breeding hybrids.
Let us take the last point--what is the scientific importance of
hybrid breeding ? As breeders we have been interested in immediate
results, such as the red orange canary from the siskin hybrid, or the
development of a sweet singer. This is important, but there is useful
data on evolutionary relationships which can also be gained from
systematic breeding. One of the best examples of this type of research
is represented by W. Frank Blair's article in Evolution (1963), " Evolu-
tionary Relationships of North American Toads of the Genus Bufo :
A Progress Report." In this publication Dr. Blair reports a syste-
matic breeding of experimental hybridization. His explanation was,
" The basic assumption underlying our use of hybridization data is
that hybrid performance is a crude reflection of total genetic difference
and hence of evolutionary affinity." In other words, the fact that
two birds mate to produce a fertile hybrid means that they are more
closely related than another pairing producing a mule. While this
has been explored in other fields (as the toad), it still remains to be
carried out with most of the Aves group.
Where can we find out which hybrids have been bred ? Certainly
Zoological Record is one of the first places to look. The section on
" Aves " (Birds) is one of interest ; the information is listed a number
of ways and there is a small section in each year's summary which is
titled " Hybrids ". Another source is Biological Abstracts , which also
gives an annual summary. Bioresearch Index and Bioresearch Titles are
both published monthly by the Biosciences Information Service ; some
additional data may be found there. A review of North American
humming bird hybrids was published in Condor (1961) by R. C.
Banks and N. K. Johnson. Other books on the subject are Mule and
Hybrid Birds by V. A. V. Carr, and Bird Hybrids by A. P. Gray, Tech.

190 J. ALAN BURDICK-HYBRID BREEDING : A REVIEW AND DISCUSSION
( ! 95 ^)- The Zoological Record, Biological Abstracts and Bioresearch Titles
do not include the more popular pet and hobby publications like
All Pets (out of print), American Cage Bird, Cage Birds, etc., and these
must be looked at separately. All publications have a bias and it
should be noted that I have " loaded " the " Finch " data, paying
less attention to the Psittacidae and Columbiformes and not reporting
the often reported Gallinaceous bird, duck, etc., hybrids.
A list of hybrids which have been bred in captivity is found in
Hopkinson's " Breeding records : Summary i-viii " ( Avicult . Mag.,
!938, vol. 39). This data is not included in this paper but is of great
importance.
The following is a list of hybrids reported in various publications
which may be of interest to the breeder of hybrids.

there is a listing of " individuals, parrots of questionable taxonomic
placement These parrots include the Quarrion ( Leptolophus hollan-
dicus) and the Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) . Gross breeding
these two common birds with other parrots would be of aid in taxonomy.
(b) I n A New Dictionary of Birds (L. Thomson) the grass finches are
listed as a tribe (. Estrildini ) of the " Weaver-Finch 55 ( Passeriformes, :
sub-order 0 seines, Estrildidae.) There seems to be a great deal of con-
fusion as to the exact relationship of Poephila, Zonaginthus and Erythura,
and a list of fertile and sterile hybrids would be useful for taxonomy.
It should be noted that notes of behaviour, such as given by Hardy
(Auk, 1966), are of great importance and should be reported, as well as
the fact of the genetic cross. Given unusual conditions it may be
possible to breed hybrids which never would occur in the natural
environment. The value to give to " crosses " and/or the amount to
give " behaviour " in the definition of species is still a much discussed
problem.

(especially Eyton's Tree Duck)
By Dillon Ripley (Litchfield, Connecticut, U.S.A.)
This has been what I would term an " Atlantic Summer 5 5 in New
England, a great deal of rain, and, along the coast frequent fog, all
through June and July. The rain has continued in a way which is
reminiscent of the bad storms of 1938 and 1955 which saturated the
land so that autumn rains associated with hurricanes created havoc-
making floods. We can hope that this pattern will not be repeated.
After a cold, miserable spring, we were surprised to find most
waterfowl breeding well, even though later than usual. Some of the
geese were affected by the late season and simply passed up nesting,
but the ducks managed well. We were pleased to rear Siberian Red-
breasts again, American Eider, Hawaiian Ducks, and Canvasback
among the waterfowl, as well as the Gough Island Moorhen among the
rails.
Our most interesting pair of nesting birds this year were the Eyton's
Tree Ducks. I had secured a supposed pair in 1963 from P. Kooy, who
is recorded in Vol. IV of Delacour's Waterfowl of the World (1964,
p. 329) as having bred them for the first time in Europe in 1961. One
of our birds, which we suspected were two males, totally uninterested in
each other, was killed by a mink in 1965, and at last, in the summer of
1966, I managed to get a female through a dealer. These birds im-
mediately paired up and became inseparable, and this spring of 1967,
showed continual interest in each other, calling continually if separated
by any distance. The calls were loud and distinctive, the usual two-
syllable, burbling note which I might render--" tch-wee." The nearest
that I could rationalize a display call by the male, was a longer version
of this--" tch-wee-tcha," or " tch-wee-tehee," usually delivered in the
water, after the male bird, flank feathers fully erect on either side, had
approached the female, head lowered as if to dip his bill in the water,
and then drawn backwards a bit in the water as a goose will do. In
the case of a displaying gander the tail is noticeably lifted, but I do
not notice this with our male Eyton's Tree Duck. It was simply that the
slight swimming backward motion of the drake, and the stiff posture
was reminiscent of a gander. As Delacour had noted (tom. cit., Vol.
I, 1954, p. 38), this species is very goose-like, the most so perhaps of all
the tree duck.
In early July we noticed the pair standing near a box on the shore
of the lower of our Canal Ponds, Soon the box began to show the
tell-tale signs of a scrape of Tree Duck with the presence of blades of
fresh green grass, fresh willow leaves, and small pieces of green weeds.
The first two eggs were noted 4th July. Subsequently a total of sixteen

were laid in two clutches of ten and six. The eggs were small and white,
bantam chicken-like, and ranged from 44-48 by 33-40 mm. in size,
smaller than those listed in Delacour (op. cit., p. 36).
Hatching was irregular, and the last six hatched finally on
1 st September, under a hen. The ducklings are paler than indicated in
Plate IV by Peter Scott, in Delacour's Vol. I (op. cit., p. 88). The back
colour of our birds is a dark sandy-buff rather than black as indicated.
In addition the streak of down on the back is long, running well up the
back to between the wings. The head pattern is more elaborate, the
superciliary streaks are continuous across the forehead and going well
back to above the ears. At about five weeks feathers begin to appear, first
on the flanks in two distinct patches, the anterior, warm brick-buff colour,
the posterior pale sandy-coloured with dark brown edges, a miniature
replica of the striking adult pattern. As feathers continue to replace the
down, an interesting feature of the juvenal or immature plumage is the
pale cream-coloured forehead and superciliary bands which reproduce
the prominent downy streaks mentioned above. The rest of the face
and hind neck becomes uniformly coloured, so that the paler forehead-
superciliary pattern is emphasized in contrast. At this time the bill also
begins to colour, glaucus along the culmen ridge, shading to pinkish
near the base of the bill and the edges of the mandibles, which become
finally fleshy-white. The nail is dark brown.
The young flock closely together, tending to fuss and bother ducklings
of other species, kept by chance in the same run. I finally separated
them, as they bullied even much older ducklings, plucking down in
patches from their backs and rumps. A goose-like posture of a resting
duckling is lying with one leg stretched completely backward, webs and
toes upside down like a goose or swan.
Our Tree Ducks in general seem to be somewhat aggressive if there
are small flocks of one species on the ponds. Our Cuban Tree Ducks
attempt to mob a pair of young Black-neck Swans whose efforts to
rebuff them are half-hearted at best. Red-billed Whistling Ducks
sometimes " gang up " on a particular duck at another time, and mob
it, setting up their shrill and rather tedious whistling at a level which
becomes irritating to the human if nearby, and must be overpowering
to the object of their temporary hysteria. As we have only a pair of
Eyton's at present, I have no experience with the species in a flock.
But if the juveniles are any indication, they too must flock together
and show common mobbing behaviour with other species.
Eyton's Tree Duck have been reared once before in North America,
by Paul A. Shaw, of Marston's Mills, Massachusetts, who reared two
out of four young from one pair in 1966.

(.Poicephalus meyeri)
By Kenneth W. Greenway (Bladon, Oxford, England)
One of my most interesting breedings this season has been the
rearing of a young Meyer's Parrot (Poicephalus meyeri).
I obtained the adult pair at the end of 1964, and housed them inside
until the following spring. They were then transferred into a small
aviary 12 by 3 feet and provided with a nest-box 18 inches deep and
9 inches square with a 3 in. entrance hole. An upturned turf was then
placed in the bottom covered with a 3 in. layer of rotten wood.
Both birds seemed very interested in this, and after seeing them
pairing on several occasions I had high hopes of them getting down
to serious nesting activities. Evidently the birds had very different
ideas, for they began to lose interest and did not make any further
attempt to breed, but I had at least established they were a true pair,
something I was not at all sure about at the beginning of the season.
1966 proved to be more or less a repetition of the previous year, with
plenty of interest again shown at the beginning by both birds. The cock
was seen feeding the hen frequently, and pairing again took place, but
still no eggs appeared. Towards the end of the summer I again put
them inside for the winter months.
By the beginning of April, 1967, I had completed a small range of
aviaries with individual flights 9 by 6 feet, into one of which I again
transferred the parrots. I also supplied them with another nest-box
constructed from an old hollow apple log, some 18 inches deep, with
the turf and rotten wood as before. To this they seemed to take an
immediate liking, and by the end of the month the hen was remaining
in the box for much longer periods than before. On 5th May I had
reason to believe she might have laid and a quick peep into the box
at an opportune moment confirmed this. A few days later two more
eggs had been added, making the total clutch of three. Naturally, at
this particular time I was anxious not to disturb them any more than
was absolutely necessary, and it was not until 3rd June that I had a
further opportunity to take another look into the box and was
delighted to see two youngsters had hatched. A few days later,
however, I was grieved to find one of these had died, but the remaining
chick looked strong and well fed ; the odd egg had still not hatched and
was subsequently found to contain a dead chick.
I now decided to curb my curiosity and try to judge progress by the
general behaviour of the parents. In the early stages I saw little of the
hen, the cock paying frequent visits to the nest-box. At such times
I could hear the faint squeak of the chick, which became louder as the
days progressed. By the middle of the month the hen was staying off

for quite long periods, probably prompted by the warm weather at this
time. She did, however, still appear to be distinctly moody, on
several occasions sitting practically motionless outside the nest-box
entrance hole for long intervals before retiring into the box, sometimes
late in the evening. It was this kind of behaviour that deterred me
from looking as often as I would have wished.
On 13th July I decided to take a chance and coax the birds into the
shelter, to enable me to have a photograph taken of the young bird
now about six weeks old.
On 26th July I noticed the young bird being fed from the entrance
hole for the first time. It finally came out of the box on the 30th, well
over eight weeks after hatching. It looked strong and well-feathered.
The general body colour was of a greenish-brown, with yellow shoulder
patches, but minus the yellow head band of the adults ; the thighs
and rump blue, the underparts being of a pale grass green.
Their diet consisted of sunflower, canary, millet, hemp soaked
millet sprays, peanuts, boiled carrot, apple, and green food in variety,
particularly sowthistle of which they were very fond.
The young bird is now fully independent and, although it began by
sleeping with its parents in the hut, with the advent of cooler nights it
now returns each evening to the nest-box.
As described, Kenneth W. Greenway has bred Meyer's Parrot
(.Poicephalus meyeri). It is believed that this may be a first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

By J. O. D'Eath (Hadley, Herts, England)
There are two forms of the above-named species, the subject of
these notes being an inhabitant of the Old World and S. sylvatica that
of the New World. The main plumage distinction between the two
forms is quite pronounced inasmuch as S. melanotos has pale grey flanks
whereas S. sylvatica has black.
The male Comb Duck or Knobnose, as it is sometimes called, is a
striking looking bird with brilliant blue-green upper parts and pale
grey flanks. The neck is white with predominant black speckling.
During the breeding season a suffusion of orange-yellow appears on
the nape of the male, whose distinguishing feature is a large fleshy knob
at the base of the beak which becomes considerably enlarged during
the breeding season. The female is less than half the size of the male.
On first sight these birds look far more goose-like.
The distribution of this species is a very wide one. It is found in
Africa south of the Sahara and then ranges eastward to India, Ceylon,
Burma, and Siam (Delacour, Waterfowl of the World , Vol. Ill, p. 123).
I have only personally observed the Comb Duck in East Africa and
it was in January, 1962, when returning from a safari to the Murchison
Falls Park, Uganda, that I saw the species in the wild for the first
time and was able to film it. On two subsequent visits to East Africa
in 1964 and 1965 I recorded these birds at various places in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda. I expected, but did not see it on a safari to
Lake Rudolf in the Northern Frontier territory of Kenya where most
other species of duck were present. I was there in February and it may
be that its absence was due to some seasonal influence. From my own
observations I would say that this species is by no means common in
East Africa, certainly not as plentiful as the Egyptian Goose. The
largest number I have recorded at any one time was a party of nine,
whereas I have seen a flock of one hundred Egyptian Geese in the
N'Gorongoro Crater (7,500 feet), Tanzania. The Comb Duck seems
to show a preference for small ponds rather than large sheets of water
and is usually encountered in parties averaging four or five. 1 have
only seen it perching on one occasion. It is not at all wary and is
quite approachable, being completely silent on taking wing. The
flight is leisurely and gives no impression of speed.
I will now turn to my brief and limited experience of this species in
captivity. Through the generosity of the Wildfowl Trust, I acquired
a pair of hand-reared Comb Ducks in 1964. I recall that my first
impression was that the male looked an aggressive type of bird and I

had some qualms about introducing it to my general collection.
However, I saw no signs of anti-social behaviour even when breeding
subsequently took place three years later. In Waterfowl of the World,
Delacour states that males should be kept in the ratio of one to three
females or more. This has not been my experience, but it may well be
an isolated one. In the collection here the male Comb Duck was
seldom seen in company with the female. On 20th May this year an
egg was found in a hollow tree-trunk set vertically in the ground. A
4 inch access hole 3 feet above water with a ladder leading to it was the
source of entry. The egg was creamy white and very highly polished.
At that time, a pair of Moluccan Radjah Shelduck had been
frequenting the area and my thoughts were focused on their breeding,
the egg description of these two species in literature somewhat
approximating.
However, nine eggs were laid at daily intervals (not on alternate
days as with most ducks). It was not until the eighth egg was laid and
brooding was about to commence that the species laying was definitely
established. It is interesting to record the small quantity of down as
compared with other hole-nesting species such as Carolina or Mandarin.
On nth June the clutch of nine eggs was set under a Bantam.
Incubation proceeded and on 8th and 9th July six ducklings had
hatched, the remaining three eggs being clear. The incubation period
therefore being twenty-eight days. I noted that the ducklings in the
sitting-box after the Bantam was lifted displayed a definite defensive
aggressive attitude which I think sufficiently unusual to record here
for any students of behaviour.
Rearing was carried out in the conventional manner with a diet of
Turkey Starter Crumbs supplemented with duck-weed and would
appear to present no difficulty. The ducklings are yellow with buffy-
brown markings and a line running through the eye. On 2nd July,
a second clutch was commenced in the same site and this amounted
to thirteen eggs. This is the largest clutch of eggs I have ever had from
any species in my thirty-five years of experience with water-fowl.
On 15th July sitting was commenced and nine eggs were transferred
to a Bantam leaving four under the female Comb Duck. She deserted
these forty-eight hours later. Out of this second clutch eight ducklings
were hatched and reared making a total of fourteen successfully
reared in all from the two clutches.
The Comb Duck seems to be very poorly represented in private
collections in this country, in fact I cannot recall seeing it at all. In
view of my experience recorded in these notes I hope that any doubts
as to this species suitability for private collections will be removed.
The Comb Duck appears to be completely hardy in our climate and
to my way of thinking is an exceedingly attractive bird and well able
to take its place in any waterfowl collection.

(.Amazona ochrocephala ochrocephala)
By Clifford Smith (Denholme, Yorks, England)
This pair of South American parrots were purchased from two
separate sources in 1961. They were both large, beautifully feathered
birds, identical even to the size of the yellow patch on the forehead and
the red feathers on the bend of the wings. To make matters worse
each of the birds " displayed ", walking quickly along the perches
with head thrust forward and wings partly opened and lowered,
showing the large variety of colours which are not normally seen when
the birds are perching.
The first indication that I had a true pair came when I noticed
that one particular bird, only recognized by a missing claw, always
positioned itself between me and the other bird when feeding, and had
no hesitation in having a bite if my hands came too near.
The birds were housed in a 10 by 5 by 6 ft. high flight with feeding
quarters in the birdhouse at the rear. Two nest-boxes were introduced,
one being a grandfather clock type, 5 feet high and 10 by 10 inches
inside. This had a 4 inch entrance hole 6 inches from the top, a wire
ladder down to the peat and turf filling about 12 inches below the
entrance. The nest-box was in the outside flight, but the top was
covered by a piece of J inch cast glass in a wood frame and firmly
screwed to the top of the aviary. The other nest-box was a natural
hollow log 15 inches in diameter with 2 inches of timber and the bark
still left on the log. As this was only about 2 feet long I stood the
hollow log on top of a solid natural log 4 feet long. This log was
placed in the flight with no overhead cover.
In the spring of 1966 mating was observed and in June the hen was
seen entering the natural log and eventually disappeared for long
periods. I was able to see into the log through the top of the aviary
with the help of a pair of stand steps, and while the hen was in the
shelter feeding, I saw two eggs lying on the peat. The hen sat very
tight for at least five weeks, but eventually left the nest and appeared
to have no further interest in it. I could not see anything from the top
of the aviary so I entered the flight. The nest was empty with no sign
of either eggs or young. This was very disappointing as I now had no
means of knowing if the eggs had been fertile or not. Both birds then
dropped into a moult so that was the finish for 1966.
In 1967 the same nest-boxes were cleaned out and given a fresh
layer of peat. I decided to give some protection to the top of the log
they had used in 1966 so I covered it in the same way as the " grand-
father " nest-box. The Amazons obliged by ignoring the log they had
used before and using the grandfather clock. The same display by
both birds, the mating and the disappearance of the hen were identical

to that of 1966 but on nth July the cries of young birds were heard.
The nest-box was not disturbed until 7th September, when a quick
look revealed two young birds, well feathered on the wings and head
and the yellow forehead was very distinct at that age. The first young
bird left the nest on 23rd September to be followed a week later by the
other bird. If the young were heard as soon as they hatched this means
a period of seventy-four days in the nest.
Both the young left the nest fully feathered and in perfect condition.
They are a slighter duller green than the adults but the black edging
to the feathers on the mantle and back is very clearly defined, I should
say more so than the adults.
The beaks of the young are all dull black and do not show any of
the horn colouring seen on top of the beaks of the adults. Whereas the
eyes of the adults show vivid reddish-brown irides, the young have
all-black eyes with just a faint suggestion of dark grey irides. This
has already become more pronounced after three weeks out of the nest.
The red shoulders to the wings are present but some of the wing-tip
feathers are black in the young whereas the adults are very dark blue.
The young are both as big as their parents and at the time of writing
are cracking their own seed, which I have put in the outside flight
under cover, but they still beg for food from the adults, who are still
willing.
While the young were being fed, both adults visited the nest and the
hen brooded the young to within three weeks of leaving the nest.
While feeding the young the adults had canary, millet, hemp,
safflower, wheat, and sunflower, both dry and soaked, but it was not
until the last week of rearing that the dry seed was eaten, preference
being shown for the soaked seed.
Although apples, grapes, and occasionally a slice of orange were
taken by the birds through the year, they had not the least interest
in fruit while feeding young. The same applied to peanuts for a period.
Greenfood was supplied every day consisting of chick-weed and
groundsel, which I believe are essential for rearing the larger parrots.
Dandelion leaves and roots were also given twice weekly.
There were some very anxious moments during the rearing period,
particularly after a violent thunderstorm, when the hen did not go in
to feed the young from noon until dusk, but the results have been well
worth the worry and time spent in breeding these beautiful parrots.
As described, Clifford Smith has bred the Yellow-fronted Amazon
(.Amazona ochrocephala ochrocephala ). It is believed that this may be a
first success.
Any member or reader knowing of a previous breeding of this
species in Great Britain or Northern Ireland is requested to communi-
cate at once with the Hon. Secretary.

On 2nd September, 1967, I acquired a pair of Abyssinian Lovebirds
(.Agapornis taranta tarantd) ; on arrival both birds were in good
condition and remarkably steady. They were offered a good seed
mixture together with sweet apple. Both birds were feeding well,
preferring sunflower to the other seeds offered. It was noticed that the
hen was eating more than the cock. The birds were isolated on arrival
and after a few days, on 5th September the hen appeared to be off-
colour, she was placed in a hospital cage at a constant temperature of

The high cage temperature was maintained for a further two days
then gradually reduced to normal room temperature, approximately

The worm was unfortunately broken up by the bird as it was passed ;
however, having watched the whole operation I would estimate the
size to be 3 1 to 4 inches in length and varying in diameter between

These portions make up approximately 3 inches in length. The head
is intact and is dark red and black. The body is tapered, white in

No doubt the force-feeding of glucose is a little unorthodox, but it
worked, without it I feel sure the bird would not have come through
the ordeal.
Although it was not possible to take the weight of the bird the loss
in weight was visible and of course handling the bird confirms this,
the breast bone became very sharp by the third day.

A number of interesting additions to the Bird Collection have been
received during recent weeks. One of the most spectacular is a South
American Spectacled Owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata ), which was sent to
us by our good friends Lieut.-Colonel and Mrs. Rubenstein, who also
sent us a Grey-winged Trumpeter. The Spectacled Owl has been
accommodated in one of our Owl Aviaries and its unique markings
make it most popular with members of the public. From the coloura-
tion it is obviously a first-year bird but very little is known about these
Owls except that they take five years to attain adult plumage and
live in thickly forested areas. Also to arrive recently were a pair of
Secretary Birds which have been housed in one of our Stork enclosures
at the rear of the Monkey House. Unfortunately both these birds are
of rather a nervous disposition but are gradually settling down. A
collection of weavers and whydahs have been introduced into one of
the Rainbow Flight Aviaries, including the following species : Red
Bishops, Baya Weaver, Yellow-shouldered, Red-collared, and Fischer's
Whydahs. Also liberated in the same aviary was a South American
Yellow-headed Marsh Bird.
With regard to the waterfowl, a pair of Egyptian Geese have arrived ;
Barnacle and Emperor Geese have been hatched at the Zoo.
The Sclater's Crested Curassows have again hatched two young
which are just over a month old at the time of writing. This is a happy
sequel to their last breeding attempt when the eggs were stolen the
day before they were due to hatch. Unfortunately both birds appear
to be cocks as were last year's birds. Another unusual hatching was
of two Indian Hill Mynas. Although these birds are commonly kept
in captivity they have rarely been recorded as breeding, in fact,
Keston Foreign Bird Farm received a Medal for breeding this species
during 1957. The only difficulties we experienced with breeding these
Mynas was their aggressive behaviour when feeding young, towards
other birds in a mixed collection. This problem was obviated by
feeding large quantities of chopped, day-old chicks which seemed to
satisfy the Mynas' voracious, carnivorous appetites.

Several rare species have been added to the collection recently; the
most exciting being pairs of Stork-billed Kingfishers and Green Wood
Hoopoes, a Narcissus Flycatcher, and a White-browed Blue Flycatcher.
In the same shipment as the Kingfishers from Bangkok were pairs of
Nicobar Pigeons, Andaman Starlings, and White-breasted Kingfishers,
and a fine group of Scarlet-backed Flowerpeckers.
Other additions of note were Bearded Reedlings, Double Striped
Thicknees, Blue-headed and Black-headed Wagtails, and Little
Minivets.
Our hen Red-billed Plornbill emerged recently after spending
seventeen weeks completely sealed inside a nest-box, apart from a
small vertical hole approximately ij inches high by J-inch wide
through which the cock bird fed her untiringly throughout. Un-
fortunately the six intact eggs were clear, but the surprising feature of
the nest cavity was that it was filled up to the level of the hole with
palm fronds, leaves, grass, and feathers. This left only a space of 4 inches
between the eggs, which were in a depression, and the top of the box.
The nest was completely unsoiled and the hen appeared none the
worse for her confinement in a space measuring no more than 8 by

As already reported, a second chick of Princess Stephanie's Bird
of Paradise hatched on 29th July. It throve and grew rapidly until
8th August when it was found to be dead in the morning. I suspect
that the mother left the nest during the night and that the cause of
death of the chick was exposure to the cold. There was some nephritis,
which is consistent with this course of events, and the report also spoke

of bone deficiency which was certainly not apparent, for, as with the
first chick, the legs were strong and well formed. The foods provided
were as before and, after all, we continued with the mealworms treated
with Scott's emulsion, but if there should be another nestling we might
try supplying mealworms that have been fed on bread treated with the
Abedec vitamin compound. At no little trouble, due to the hostility of
the owners, we got some wood-ant cocoons, but so far as we could tell,
the mother did not take any of them ; we also offered fresh wasp larvae
and these were also refused, which was surprising, for there can be few
insectivorous birds that would decline such a delicacy. The food given
by the mother to the chick was regurgitated at the nest and, so far as we
could tell, mealworms and cleaned maggots were the main items. The
mother searched for something in the grass and so we sprinkled down
some limestone grit and oyster shell, though whether she took any is
not known. The chick, though only ten days old, was more advanced
in plumage growth than the first and, we thought, proportionately
more advanced in bodily growth. The father and all other insecti-
vorous birds were removed from the aviary, so there was little or no
competition for the live food.
A Black-bellied Bustard ( Lissotis m. melanogaster) , a genus new to the
collection, and three Woodchat Shrikes ( Laniuss . senator ), a new species,
have been presented by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark. Another
new species is a Least Bittern ( Ixobrychus exilis ), which appears to be
an immature male, and which flew on to a ship some 400 miles east-
ward of New York. Another is Anas punctata , the Hottentot Teal, of
which a pair has been received from Tanzania. Two new sub-species
are a pair of the Cyprus Rock Partridge (Aledoris graeca Cypriotes ) and
the East African White-winged Whydah ( Euplectes albonotatus eques).
A second Chinese Serpent-Eagle from Dr. K. C. Searle, a Swain-
son's Lorikeet from Lady Baillie, a Curlew from Master Guy Harrison,
a Green Wood-Hoopoe from Mr. L. W. Hill, four Oystercatchers, an
Aubry's Parrot, a Yellow-cheeked Parrot, a Heuglin's Robin-Chat,
two Western Yellow-collared Iridophanes, and four Amethyst Star-
lings are other notable arrivals.
Three Sacred Ibises, three Cattle Egrets, two Peafowl, a Silver Gull,
five Grey-headed Gallinules, a Barn Owl, and a Purple Honeycreeper
have been bred in the Gardens, the last being, I believe, the first
breeding in this country, as is the Cloncurry Parrakeet now independent

J. H. Reay reports the breeding of one of the most charming doves,
the Green-winged Chalcophaps indie a. In May, two young were reared,
and a further pair left the nest on 21st August and are doing well. This
dove is a little unpredictable where breeding is concerned. Some pairs
nest readily, rearing several broods in a short time, and then having a
lengthy rest. Reay's result is the more pleasing in that his pair have
been with him since 1963.

In the July-August number of the Magazine I mentioned Popinjay
as being an archaic name for a parrot. Many and ingenious are some of
the suggested derivations of this name, but none is really very con-
vincing. There is a somewhat similar word in most languages. Its
use does not appear to be confined to parrots, and in all probability it
has at some time been applied to almost any brightly-plumaged bird.
In England the name was, and is perhaps still, used provincially for
the Green Woodpecker.

A note in Bokmakierie, June, 1967, quotes a report that nearly 95
million Quelea Finches, weighing a total of 6,000 tons, were killed last
year by night-flying pilots in poison-spraying operations. The highest
number of Queleas killed in one year was 142 million, in the season
before last. The not unattractive Red-billed Weaver was formerly
imported from time to time. There are several British breeding
records, most of which are not very convincing. It may, of course,
be that with so common a bird success was not considered worth
recording.

Mrs. K. M. Scamell sends further news of her Ruby-throated
Bulbuls : " They threw out their chick at four days. I removed an
unhatched egg which was addled. We put up two more nest-boxes to
encourage them, but they laid again in the old box. Last Sunday
(10th September) there were two eggs in it and this morning (Tuesday)
there was some excitement in the flight, and I have seen egg shells, so
it is likely that one young one has hatched anyway. I daren't go very
near them except to feed, so will have to wait and see. The Humming
Bird is again on eggs, after moulting ! "

When a species is threatened to an extent when only a few dozen
individuals are known to survive in the wild any expedient to save it
from extinction is justified.
The wild population of the Whooping Crane is believed to be
only forty-three. The birds' only known breeding ground is in the
Sass River area of Wood Buffalo National Park, in northern Canada.
The Canadian Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Sport Fisheries,
and Wildlife have co-operated in a special operation. Six eggs were
collected and sent to the Bureau's rearing station at Patuxent, Mary-
land. Five were successfully hatched and all the young, including one
that has a weak leg-joint, are reported to be doing well.

There is an extraordinary letter concerning Lyre-bird hybrids in the
Magazine, 1905, 46. A. W. Milligan, said to be a well-known Aus-
tralian ornithologist and field-naturalist, writes : "I was never able
to rear Menura superha, although I made many attempts to do so. I
had, however, hybrids between the Lyre-bird and the common fowl,
and exhibited them at the Victoria Poultry Show many years ago."
The Editor, D. Seth-Smith, comments : " The production of such
a hybrid is most extraordinary. We hope to hear more on the subject."
We did not, as was but to be expected, and can only consider the
Editorial " most extraordinary " too mild.

The Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca) is regarded almost as a regular
winter-visitor to the Shetlands. In years gone by there have been
reports of the breeding of this species, but none has been substantiated.
Now the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has been able to
announce the first authentic breeding for at least a century. A pair
nested on the smallest of the main islands Fetlar--sometimes called
the " Green island " because of its fields--during the past summer.
A clutch of seven eggs was laid ; six young ones were hatched and
successfully reared. One of the young ones might have been lost but
for the fact that Dr. Jeffery Harrison was holidaying on the island. It
had the misfortune to fly into barbed wire. Dr. Harrison inserted
three stitches in a wing muscle and twenty in the skin of the wing.
Within two or three days it was flying again.

Dr. R. E. B. Brown, Newcastle, N.S.W., writes : "My old cock
Red Tanager died recently. He was the first one I ever reared--
hatched 12th November, 1938 ; died 30th June, 1967. He reared
one young one during his last summer. The other day I was out driving
in the foothills of the Mount Royal Mountain range and I came to a
place where pomegranates had gone wild and formed a dense scrub.
The bushes were about twenty feet high and were laden with the
large, ripe fruit. The scrub was fairly extensive as I drove through it
on a winding track. It was thirty-seven miles in width, by my speedo-
meter. In this scrub there was the largest concentration of King
Parrots I have ever seen. There must be many thousands there. There
were also many Pennants, and I also saw a few Wonga Wonga Pigeons.
The Kings were mostly in immature plumage. The King in the bush is
extremely active. One large flock were doing evolutions around the tops
of the hills exactly as one sees domestic pigeons doing round their lofts.
I had some success with Crested Cardinals last summer, rearing ten
from one pair. They are quite rare here as none has been imported
since before the war. In fact, all foreign birds are rare here except
Waxbills, Asiatic Munia, and Cut-throats, and a few other birds that

" Cora," one of the Tower of London's Ravens, died during the
first week of September, aged twenty-one. She has been replaced by
" Merry ", six months old. About twelve years ago four young Ravens

<bodyText confidence="0.9522007" page_id="56379315"  page_num="208" year="" vol="">
that had fallen from a dislodged nest were taken to Stanley Latchford,
of Old Colwyn, North Wales. They were about a month old ; one
had a broken wing that Latchford successfully set, two were sound
birds, but the fourth died after about a week, probably as a result of
internal injuries. The three that were successfully reared proved to be
two males and one female. One, " Grog," was presented to the Tower
of London, the two others being retained by Latchford. At the sixth
attempt this pair has recently reared three young ones, of which one is
" Merry ".
In the early part of the century Lord Lilford and W. LI. St. Quintin
bred Ravens quite freely.
I like the letter signed Ellis S. Harris in Notes on Cage Birds , First
series, p. 163 (1882), where he says : " I have a fine young pair which
were hatched in March, 1881, from a pair of old birds in possession of a
gipsy, who has bred them from domesticated birds for the last ten
years. They reared six young this season. He tells me that the hen
makes her nest in an old box, and that the cock bird takes his turn on
the nest. He lets the birds out in his yard at breeding time."
But in more recent years, apart from the present case, there appear
to have been few, if any, Ravens bred in captivity.

REVIEW
THE WATCHER AT THE NEST. By M. M. Nice, Constable and

Mrs. Nice is, as I hope readers of the Avicultural Magazine
already know, one of the world's most eminent ornithologists. She is
also a bird lover in all the best meanings of the term.
In this book, which is a re-publication of one first published in 1939,
she has written a popular account of her observations at the nest sites
of many species, of some of her hand-reared pet birds and, most
important, interesting and moving of all, a popular precis of her well-
known study of the behaviour of the Song Sparrow. I need hardly say
I here use the word " popular " without any detracting implication.
Certainly much " popular " natural history writing is mendacious and
misleading but at its best, as in Mrs. Nice's book, popular writing is at
least as important, possibly more important, than " scientific " writing
aimed only at the experts.

Those who know North America--on my only visit there I was
impressed by the great abundance of brilliantly-coloured passerine
species and the paucity of pigeons--will find a memory recalled on
every page ; for those who have not, Mrs. Nice's text, aided by Roger
Tory Peterson's sketches, brings Cowbirds, Bobwhites, Yellow-
crowned Night Herons, and other transatlantic species vividly to life.
This is above all true of those little brown buntings, the Song Sparrows,
whose saga occupies most of the first half of the book. Indeed I
found the disappearance (and almost certain death) of the longest-
lived male, 4M, almost as saddening as the death of the dog Argos in
the Odyssey.
I think that everyone fond of birds will enjoy and profit from this
book.

REPLIES TO MR. BARNICOAT
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988215189189189" page_id="56379316"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
Other contributors to our Magazine will, I think, appreciate the glow of long-
hungry, but at-last-fed vanity, with which I read Mr. F. C. Barnicoat's statement that
he has long been an admirer of my articles. I have, of course, always hoped, and in
my vainer moments assumed, that our readers like them, but those who actually admit
the fact in word or print are few ; discounting my friends whose (expressed) views on
the subject must, of course, be suspect as they are at least potentially capable of being
swayed by partiality or kindness. I am, therefore, sorry that on re-reading my remarks
about the National Show which Mr. Barnicoat has read with such evidently pained
surprise, I find that what I wrote then I think still.
I should, however, like the opportunity to reply here to the points raised by Mr.
Barnicoat in his letter of such kindly criticism, and write this in the hope that if, as is
all too often the case, our fair Editor is a bit short of copy I shall be allowed space to
do so:--
In the matter of publicising the fact that show birds are only kept for short periods
in show cages South Africa is ahead of Britain. I hope our shows, if they continue,
will follow this good example. I suppose it would be too much also to hope that each
cage should be clearly labelled with the English and the scientific name of the bird
inside it ? If that were done shows would have much more educational value.
I am glad Mr. Barnicoat and I think alike about Scots Fancy Canaries and like
monsters. I agree with him that the Lizard Canary is beautiful, at least when it is
not " broken-capped ". I think anyone reading my article would understand that the
statement about " mere travesties " was a generalization. I had in mind more par-
ticularly the Budgerigar fancy, where the standard of size and shape is, at present,
uniform for all breeds. This, of course, is not the case with Canaries and Domestic
Pigeons, although even in these a majority of the more popularly shown breeds are ,
in my opinion, mere travesties of the beautiful original. One sees more Norwich and
Yorkshire Canaries than Lizards at most shows, more Fantail and Carrier Pigeons than
clean-legged Ices or Archangels.
The mutant forms of the Zebra Finch may be remarkable, although it might be
mentioned that nothing really new has been produced, all the " new " colours and
patterns have been produced by the loss of some pigment and/or marking possessed
by the wild form. Without knowing how interesting and elevated the wildest visions of
an earlier generation of Zebra Finch breeders were I cannot, of course, express a
valid opinion as to whether our present-day assortment of unnaturally-coloured
Zebra Finches surpass them in these respects or not. I do know, however, that in my
opinion, they most certainly do not surpass the wild Zebra Finches that I saw in
Australia for interest and quality, or incidently, for beauty.

I will concede that some of the colours of Budgerigars " like violet and sky-blue "
are of great beauty although none more beautiful than the natural green in my eyes,
but I think the Budgerigar was well on the way to being " illustrious the world over "
before they were produced in any number if at all. The Budgerigar, I would suggest,
became " illustrious the world over " because it was a very small and beautiful
parrakeet that proved extremely easy to keep and breed in captivity. The fancy by
" the development of other features " in the form of larger size, shorter wings, pro-
portionately larger and more bulging heads, and so on, seems bent on destroying some
of the original Budgerigar's chief charms--its small and dainty form, its liveliness, and
its hardiness. Perhaps this is one reason why a certain organization now seems to think
it necessary to run a publicity campaign to try to restore the species to its former
popularity. The values of the fancy may not be always perverse but if, as I deem to be
the case, distorting originally beautiful birds ranks as perversity, they seem to be more
often than not.
I have no wish to deprecate " the valuable efforts " of fellow aviculturists but I do
not think that fanciers (in the showman's meaning of the term) are aviculturists, and
I think their efforts to produce birds that differ in size, shape and proportions from
the original wild forms are the very antithesis of aviculture. Such efforts, if successful,
do in fact ensure that natural beauty does, indeed, end in the wild state ! Blue and
lutino Ringneck Parrakeets may indeed be beautiful. I think they are, but it is cer-
tainly not a natural beauty since these forms do not occur, except as occasional freaks,
in the wild state.
I am not against the production and breeding of " new " colours in our aviary
stocks of any species, provided that this does not result in the neglect (with danger of
permanent loss) of the wild or natural colour-pattern. But although I am prepared to
swallow the gnat of new colour I most certainly baulk at the ungainly camels of
larger size, changed proportions, crests, frills, feathered legs, multiple toes, and the
rest. When I visit a bird show, or see the showman's cast-offs in the pet shops (some
of them superannuated breeding birds now cruelly condemned to pass their final
years in solitary confinement as " pet budgies ", a role for which they are quite
unsuitable), I am afraid I do wistfully long for the original wild Budgerigar. If it were
possible to obtain some I should be very tempted to take up Budgie breeding.
If Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Wisdom is in the mind of its definer. Taking
an objective view of mankind I am less hopeful than Mr. Barnicoat that wfsdom of
any kind is likely to prevail.
In conclusion, might I suggest that a more laudable effort than trying to change
the size, shape, and colour of birds would be to try, without sacrificing natural beauty,
to breed for tameness. How delightful it would be, for example, to have all our
Diamond Doves, or even all our Canaries and Budgerigars, as tame as Barbary Doves !

I can well understand why Mr. F. C. Barnicoat should defend the causes of " the
Fancy " against the views expressed by Mr. Derek Goodwin (a critic at the show), for
he apparently believes that the many-hued Gouldian Finch needs whitewashing to
improve its attractiveness.
Man has, through the centuries, manipulated many wild species to his own great
advantage, but the view that man's alterations have improved the species involved is
questionable.
The wild budgerigar might not win on the showbench but would the exhibition
" thing " survive in the wild? Surely this is the only criterion to establish if man's
improvements on nature were justified.
I, like Mr. Goodwin, feel that " the Fancy " produces travesties of the original, and
I lament the fact that some of the most skilled bird breeders should devote their time
to this almost worthless side of aviculture.
