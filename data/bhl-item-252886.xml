The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avictjltubal Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures 2|- inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
inscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."
The Council may grant a special medal to any member who shall succeed
in breeding any species of bird that has not previously been bred in captivity in
Europe.

Pheasants are frequently discovered in strange ways ; often
a species is captured and kept alive for many years in a pen before
it is publicly known to the scientific world ; on the other hand,
some Pheasants are known to science only through their long tail-
feathers, and it takes a number of years before the complete bird
becomes known. It is very unusual for any bird to be discovered
in such curious ways. The explanation is not very difficult, as in the
jungle Pheasants are, as a rule, almost impossible to shoot,
although they are common under cover. If you camp in a Malayan
jungle you may hear a cock Argus crowing every morning and
evening, but it is practically impossible to see them. Wild Pheasants
kept in the aviaries come to us through the native snare, a primitive
method of capturing Pheasants alive, but there is no modern method
to replace it. We recall that the first Lineated Pheasant which
came to our notice was kept in an aviary in Malacca although its
native home is some 500 miles away. Baily's Peacock Pheasant
was kept many years in Devonshire, but its original home is still
unknown. I can give you a reverse example. The Mikado
Pheasant was originally known to science through two central tail-
feathers only, which a head-hunter of Arisan in Formosa carried
as an ornament on his headdress. I believe the history of the
discovery of Rheinard's Pheasant was much the same ; a French-
man picked up its tail-feather in a jungle in Annam which became
a treasure to the Paris Museum, but it has taken many years before

the museum received a complete bird. It is for this reason that
aviculture has contributed much to the advancement of Pheasant
study, and phasianists are doing good which the pure scientific
worker cannot undertake. For instance, Captain Delacour has
discovered the rare Imperial Pheasant and has done more good by
breeding and distributing them to many Zoos in the world than
by preserving them for the museum. I am now going to tell you
an entirely new history of the discovery of a Pheasant whose home
is still unknown. The illustration which is reproduced here is a
Black Kalij Pheasant, and its discovery is an interesting story.
Mr. Leland Smith, a well-known game-bird breeder, of Fair
Oaks, some fifteen miles out of Sacramento, California, received
from Calcutta in 1934 a pair of unidentified Kalij Pheasants. The
male is black throughout the body, with abundant steel-blue sheen
on the dorsal part. The abdominal part of the body is not so
glossy, and the breast feathers have very faint shaft markings of a
paler shade. That is to say, the bird resembles melanotus , but has
the under parts black, or is like horsfieldi without the white rump.
The female differs from melanotus in having a plain buff-coloured
throat, the central pair of tail feathers more like horsfieldi , plain
hair-brown without any markings. The pair bred successfully
during the following year, 1935. The twenty-seven eggs laid are
much darker than leucomelanos eggs, having more pinkish buff and
pointed ends with abundant white " chippings ", as against the
very pale buffish tinted eggs, without the pinkish tinge of the latter.
The incubation period was twenty-three days, like that of all the
other Himalayan Kalijs. Two pairs of offspring reached maturity.
The illustration here reproduced is of an adult cock, hatched in
1935, now preserved in the California Academy of Sciences, and
it is the type specimen from which I have named the species.
Both male and female offspring are identical with their parents
which were imported from India. The original pair did not breed
in 1936, but Mr. Smith was more successful in 1937. In May
there were nine normally coloured chicks, and in October several
young cocks assumed their adult plumage, which was exactly the
same as that of their male parent.
The colour of the chick is particularly important, because
mutant chicks of both the Golden and the Common Pheasants are
chocolate brown with yellow portions.

The breeding experiment of this Kalij Pheasant not only proves
that it breeds true to type, but that it is not a melanistic mutant,
in spite of the cock having a uniformly dark plumage ; therefore,
I proposed to name it Gennceus moffitti in honour of Mr. James
Moffitt, of the California Academy of Science.
I was in California at the time of its discovery, but on my return
to Japan some half a dozen birds have been discovered in my
friend's aviary and some of which successfully reared their young.
I hope that within a few years the Californian and Japanese birds
will be exchanged, and before long we shall be able to supply a
stock to many Zoos, although its native habitat may be still

BREEDING THE CHINESE AZURE-WINGED
MAGPIE
(Cyanopicacyana swinhoei)
By Sydney Porter
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.9970951" page_id="56239157"  page_num="3" year="" vol="">
This beautiful Magpie was an early love of mine. When a
callow youth, one of the first bird books I possessed was Bree's
History of the Birds of Europe (a most inaccurate book, by the way)
and in it was an illustration of this bird. From that time, whether
in an illustration or in the flesh, I have never ceased to admire it.
Years later I saw some of the birds in Mr. Ezra's aviaries, and my
desire to possess it increased a hundredfold. Dealers said they
would procure some for me, friends said they would send me some
from China, but somehow they never materialized, and one of the
reasons I went to China some years ago was to try and get hold of
some of these birds. However, I was again unlucky, for although
the bird seemed common enough (there were lots of them in the
public parks in Shanghai) none of the bird dealers seemed to have
them, neither did they want to procure any. It was certainly most
unusual to see birds of this species in captivity in the Far East.
I wonder if there is some superstition concerning it, and for that
reason it is never caught ?
Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed at not being able
to get hold of any, and when I left China I felt that I should never
possess them. Some months after I arrived back in England six

baby " Azure-wings " turned up, brought by the Chinese cook
of a certain ship on which I was a passenger, and to whom I had
shown a picture of the birds and asked him to try and get some
for me. Judging by the looks of them, they must have just been
hatched when they left China, for they were only just fledged
when I received them, and the period from the time of hatching
to being fully fledged is only a month ! They were very dirty and
bedraggled, but otherwise lively and healthy. A few minutes after
they had been placed in an aviary they commenced to bathe, and
that has been their favourite occupation ever since. In a few 1
days they looked their own immaculate selves, and have never
ceased to delight the eye of any one who sees them.
For several years they lived in a large aviary with various -
other birds, mostly Starlings, Pies, etc. They were never
aggressive and took little notice of the other birds but, if one of
their number was attacked by any other bird the whole party
soon routed the aggressor.
I have never owned birds quite so fearless and tame as these.
As soon as one entered their aviary they were all over one. They
seemed to imagine that humans were always in a verminous state,
for every part of one's exposed anatomy and clothing was examined,
one's hair was systematically searched ; also in and behind one's
ears, one's lips and fingers were prised open, they searched one's
pockets, the turn-ups of one's trousers ; they would even push
up my trousers and search my legs. I have spent many an amusing
hour with the birds making a thorough investigation of my person,
always to their great disappointment except in the breeding season
when they managed to secure beakfulls of hair, wool from my
socks, or pull a silk tie to pieces for their nesting material !
About a year after I received them the birds showed signs of
nesting, so nest boxes were put up, and although nests were built
and eggs laid and hatched, none was ever reared because we had
no spare aviary for each pair of birds. Also because the other
birds in the aviary ate the live food and also, as often as not, I was
abroad through health reasons and only got back when the
breeding season was over. It was only with the advent of the war
and not being able to leave the country that serious attention was
given to the birds in the requirements for breeding.
In April of last year (1940) two pairs of birds were placed in

<bodyText confidence="0.998345153846154" page_id="56239159"  page_num="5" year="" vol="">
separate aviaries and they commenced nesting operations almost
at once. They built in open boxes fastened to the side of the
aviaries. These boxes had been in the large aviary, and the birds
had nested in them before, though as mentioned previously they
had never reared their young.
The nests were very much like those of a Blackbird, except that
they were lined with cow hair, moss, and feathers. One pair made
a " double-decker " nest anticipating the overcrowding which
would result from eight young ones. As a matter of fact this was
a very sensible idea, for when the nest did become overcrowded
some of the youngsters would most certainly have fallen out had
they not been transferred to the other nest. The question will
be asked, why did they not build a larger nest. The answer being,
I suppose, that they could not get over their natural instinct to
build the usual type of nest.
One pair laid eight eggs and the other seven. As it appeared
to be rather a task to obtain the necessary amount of live food in
war time for the anticipated fifteen youngsters, we put an egg
from each nest into a near-by Blackbird's nest, which had laid at
the same time as the Pies, but we were reckoning without the
Blackbird who, though the eggs were very similar, promptly
ejected them, so we were glad we had put no more in.
We miscalculated the date of hatching, thinking that the eggs
would take at least eighteen days to hatch, but they hatched on the
fifteenth day, and two youngsters died before I realized they were
in the nest and had supplied the parents with live food.
We managed to buy the last few pounds of mealworms in the
country before the German invasion of Holland stopped the
supplies. These, with the addition of cockroaches from a restaurant
kitchen and wood lice, etc., sufficed for the first few days. After
then we managed to get gentles and a few mice. The young ones
were hatched absolutely bare of any down, and were bright pink
in colour. After the first day they turned a dark leaden colour,
and remained quite naked until the first pin feathers appeared in
the wings on the seventh day.
The birds did not all hatch on the same day, but it took about
three days for the nest of six to hatch. So rapidly did they grow
that by the time the last was hatched the first was quite large.
When first hatched the young ones were about the size of a

newly hatched Blackbird, but by the seventh day they were as i
large as Sparrows, and by the end of the second week, when they j
were the size of a Starling and partially fledged, they commenced
to leave the nest. At this stage they very closely resembled King- &amp;apos;
fishers, and had I not known what they were I would have sworn
that they were young Sacred Kingfishers. i
When they left the nest they were unable to fly, but managed
to scramble into the bushes where they remained perfectly motion-
less with the feathers tightly compressed and the beak pointing 1
upwards.
So still did the birds remain, and so well did their colour
assimilate into that of their surroundings, that it was next to
impossible to see them. After about a week of this inaptitude they
commenced to move about and show themselves on the barer
branches.
The birds have a very distinct juvenile plumage. The general j
colour is light fawn, the throat, a ring round the neck, the vent,
and lower parts pure white. The head, which has a blue-black cap
in the adult, had the feathers tipped with fawn, which gave it a !
frosted appearance. Only the flight and tail feathers were pale
blue as in the parents. The wing coverts were fawn tipped with
a slightly lighter colour, these in the adult are azure blue. The
white-tipped blue tail feathers did not begin to grow until the
third week.
During the period the Pies had their young ones they were
extremely aggressive. They had a very definite method of attack ;
if one kept one's eyes always upon the birds they behaved as
though nothing was wrong, but as soon as they managed to get
behind one they flung themselves in a lightning attack at one's
head, repeating this with incredible rapidity giving one very nasty
pecks on the crown of one's head or giving very painful tweaks to
one's ears.
By the end of the third week the young were almost as large
as their parents, and were flying about the aviary. It was then
that the parents commenced nesting operations again, though they
still continued to feed the young whilst sitting on the second clutch
of eggs.
The one pair again made the " double-decker " nest, in fact
they had laid before they had time to finish the second nest, the

first egg being laid on the bare boards. After that the nest was
constructed as the bird continued to lay.
I used to let the cock of this pair out and he used to delight in
flying round in ever widening circles, sometimes going round to
the other aviaries and telling the inmates just what he thought
about them ! When he had finished he would alight on my arm
or shoulder and let me carry him into the aviary again. If he was
not ready no amount of coaxing would get him in. If I offered
him mealworms he would stuff his crop and beak full, and then
go round the other aviaries and distribute them to the other Pies.
This male was a most intelligent bird, and the only times I thought
him lacking in his usual common sense were when he had too many
tit-bits ; he would then go round and dig holes in the ground,
put in his treasure, fill up the hole, and carefully put leaves over it ;
but he never seemed to notice a hen Argus Pheasant in the same
aviary always stealing behind to unearth his treasures as soon as
he had left them. I never saw him go back for them, so I suppose
he forgot all about them once he had buried them.
Soon after leaving the nest we found one of the young ones
in the Argus Pheasant's food pot ; it had been very badly mauled
and was dead. I rather suspect the hen Pheasant of doing this.
When the second nests of youngsters were well on the way
with five and six in each respectively something seemed to go
wrong. The birds of the first nests, now fully fledged, started to
drink excessively, in fact they seemed to spend all their time by
the water pot, in a day or two they grew weaker, and soon I was
met each morning by my aviary attendant with handfulls of dead
Pies. Nineteen in all succumbed. Three only survived and are
now living. A post mortem revealed that the birds were suffering
from inflammation of the bowels due to a heavy infection by tape-
worms of the species Hymenolepis. The source of the infection by
this tape-worm is usually insects which happen to be the secondary
hosts of the worm. Thus it was obvious that the infection had
been passed on by the " gentles ", which had been feeding on the
meat of some animal which had previously been infected.
As is often the case with aviary-bred birds, the young ones
were never as friendly or confiding as their parents, and even
after six months they spent most of their time in the bushes and
were seldom seen.

8 S. PORTER-BREEDING THE CHINESE AZURE-WINGED MAGPIE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99753152" page_id="56239162"  page_num="8" year="" vol="">
The Azure-winged Magpie, of which there are three subspecies,
has an extraordinary distribution, being found in certain parts of
North-East China, Japan, and South-Eastern Siberia, also in
restricted localities in Spain and Portugal. There is little doubt
that the bird was introduced into its European habitat by the early
voyagers to the Far East, who brought the birds back as pets.
I am quite sure that the bird could easily be established in this
country, and it would be a useful and beautiful addition to our
avifauna. It is too small to prey on other birds or their eggs ; its
diet being mainly composed of insects and berries.
In colour this bird is mainly ash grey, slightly darker on the
back, and fading to white on the throat. There is a large cap of
shining blue-black. The flight feathers and wing coverts, also
the long graduated tail, are pale azure blue. The two long central
tail feathers are tipped with white, so also are the flight feathers.
Strangely enough the young ones have all the tail feathers white-
tipped except the central ones. The beak and legs all black.
The plumage is extremely light and fluffy, which gives the bird a
certain softness in appearance.
This Magpie is the smallest of the Crow-like birds as well as
the most beautiful. It is about the size of a Thrush, but the long
graduated tail makes it appear much larger.
The eggs are about the same size as a Blackbird's, but rather
pear-shaped, of a pale greenish grey colour heavily marked with
darker grey and brown towards one end.

BLACK LORY (No. 329) , x Chalcopsitta ater ( Scopoli).
The only success is Brook in Scotland in 1909 ; Avic. Soc.
Medal for a first. One young bird was reared and the species bred
again in the following year. (See Bird Notes, igog , 227, 268, 284 ;

BLUE-DIADEMED LORY, Eos histrio (Muller, 1176).
No record of true breeding, but hybrids, histrio X variegata,
were bred in California in 1931 by Miss Benchley, teste EOiseau,
igg2, p. 706. Three of these young hybrids were reared, and
Mrs. Bonestell tells me (in lit) that she has seen them.
VIOLET-NECKED LORY, Eos variegata ( Gm.).
First bred by Soudee in France in 1926 (. UOiseau, ig27, if).
Mrs. Bonestell had a more recent success as an egg laid by her pair
of Violet-necks was hatched and the young one reared in 1939 by
her pair of BLUE-STREAKED LORIES. An early partial
success is recorded by Neunzig in Germany : " Frau Pro we . . .

bird was reared, which was six months old at that date.
CHATTERING LORY (No. 330), Domicella garrula (Linn).
One young bird bred and reared by Lord Poltimore in 1913
(B.N., 1913, 375 ; 1914, 17)- More recently bred in the U.S.A.
by Mrs. Bonestell (Aviculture (U.S.A.), 1940, 24). A hybrid with
the male SWAINSON'S LORIKEET is also on record.
PURPLE-CAPPED LORY, D. domicella (Linn).
Has been bred in America, but the only evidence I have is
Aviculture (U.S.A.), 1940, p. 24, where Mrs. Bonestell puts in for a
Medal for the first breeding. The success is no doubt described
somewhere else in the magazine, but as I now only see an
occasional number the looking up of this reference must be for a
successor.
BLACK-CAPPED LORY (No. 331), D. lory (Linn).
Bred by Mrs. Dalton-Burgess in 1921 in a large cage. One
young one was reared to live at least a year, its age when I saw it.
See A.M., 1921, 116; B.N., 1921, 183 ; UOiseau, 1921, 149.
FORSTEN'S LORIKEET (No. 332), Trichoglossus forsteni, Bp.
Michell was awarded the A.S. Medal in 1905 for having been
the first to breed them in the United Kingdom, and he had a
second success in 1906. See A.M., 1906, 24, 49 ; 1907, 81; and Seth-
Smith's Parrakeets, 2nd edition, p. 310. Neunzig says that a pair in
a London outdoor aviary reared one young bird out of three
hatched in 1900 ; is this date a misprint for 1906, Michell's, or
was there an earlier success than his ? This Lorikeet had been
bred at the Calcutta Zoo long before (1900 or earlier) teste Frank
Finn, Ibis, 1901, 439.

FORSTEN'S x RED-COLLARED LORIKEET.
Bred by Whitley at Paignton, 1927, but like most of his successes
never recorded. I saw the young bird in August and again in
the following year and in 1932, by which time it had a number
of brothers and sisters.

First bred at the Zoo in 1910 (see Report ), and since then else-
where. Brook (B.N., 1916, 207, 214) reports that they had been
breeding with him for the last eight years and were still continuing
to increase in numbers. They were also bred more than once by
Waddell ( B.N ., 1913, 290; 1916 , 69, 190 ) and by Whitley, but
never, of course, recorded by the latter. All these in the U.K. ;

Bred by Pauvels in Belgium in 1912, when one young bird
was reared and the F.B.C. Medal awarded. Millsum gives an
account of the happenings in Bird Notes , 1912, 238, 338; 1913 , 273
1 A much earlier record of the breeding of a Lorikeet which was probably
the RED-COLLARED, is to be found in Latham's General History of Birds , vol. ii
( 1822 ), p. 123. Here under the name " Red-breasted Parrot ", the author
writes : " M. Levaillant informs us that a pair of these imported from Amboina
bred in the menagerie of M. van Blettemberg, Governor of the Cape of Good
Hope. The female made the nest, lining it with feathers from her breast and
laid two white eggs ; the young were hatched in 19 days ; they were at first
covered with greyish down and by degrees gained the green feathers and the
blue on the head, and the parents continued to feed them for six months."
Levaillant was in South Africa from 1781 to 1784, so that the date of this
success must have been about then, and could no doubt be fixed more exactly
if the date of van Blettemberg's Governorship could be ascertained, as no doubt
it could be. I think that the species meant by Latham is the RED-COLLARED,
but it may have been T. h. hamatodus {Linn) or T. h. cyanogrammus (Wagler ) ; it
was certainly a Trichoglossus.

SWAINSON'S LORIKEET (No. 335), T. moluccanus ( Gm .).
" Blue Mountain Lories 55 (the old name) have often been
bred, especially in early days. Neunzig ( p . 783) says they " were
first bred by Heublin in Coburg in 1873, and since then by many
others--to the third generation by Petermann at Rostock. 55 In
Le Bulletin , 1877, 1481, their breeding in France by Hourdain in
1876 or 1877 * s reorded, and De Brisay in his Dans nos volieres,
p. 31 , mentions another French success, Lebehan in Poitou in 1880.
Seth-Smith, writing in A.M ., 1907, 209 , on old records, says
they " seem to have been bred successfully some 25 or 30 years ago
from the letters ... to the Bazaar published in the first series
of Notes on Cage-birds (1882). One writer appears to have reared
two broods in a season and writes (p. 87) : # I have . . . the names
of four amateurs who have bred this Parrot 5 ... In the second
series . . . another writer records the successful breeding of a pair
in the Blackpool Aquarium . . . where they bred year after year
for some four years previous to 1890."
Among more recent records are Miss Little in 1909 and later,
E. R. Phillips ( B.N ., 1917 , 237 ), Amsler, Chiozza Money, and
others. Miss Little in 1912 reported the breeding of a second
generation ; her successes are fully described in Bird Notes , vi,
312 ; vii, 24 ; 186, viii; 1910 , 229 ; 1912, 229. The Editor of B.N.,

Successfully bred at the Zoo in 1917--a first teste Seth-Smith,
A.M., 1917, 268.
MITCHELL'S LORIKEET, T. mitchellii, Gray.
First bred by Dr. Derscheid in Belgium in 1936 ; he gave a full
account of the events in A.M ., 1938, 2j6. Two young left the nest
in September, 1936, and they were both still alive in the following
September, by which time the old pair had produced another
single youngster. Dr. D. in his article gives other records :--
1897. Berlin Zoo : 2 eggs but no young reared.
1937. Lowman in Holland : 2 (perhaps 3) young reared.
In A.M ., 1938, 227, Dr. Osman Hill reports the successful
rearing of mitchelli in Ceylon ; three young reared from two broods,
and the parents nesting again at time of writing.
ORNATE LORIKEET (No. 337), T. ornatus (. Linn ).
The first breeding on record is that of Comely in France in
1883 ; he bred them again in 1885, and accounts appeared in
Bulletin d'Acclimit. 1884 , p. 923 , and 1886, p. 363. Neunzig says that
the two young obtained by Comely only lived three weeks, but I
think that he overlooked the second year's success, which receives
confirmation in De Brisay's L Aviculture. The only other record
I have is a very recent one, " two young reared by Mrs. Wood
in California in 1932," teste UOiseau , 1933 , 423. Mrs. Bonestell

By H. C. Martin
Tidying up my desk the other day, I came across an envelope
containing some photographs, taken out in Uruguay a good few
years ago now, and portraying a cluster of three Horneros' nests,
built year by year by the same pair in the same tree, and one of
which is based upon another, hour-glass fashion, a choice of site
which, though I have seen hundreds of these nests during many
years residence out in that country, I never observed but this once,
nor have friends long living in the cc camp 55 ever noticed one
similarly placed. One of the pictures shows the double nest quite
nicely but with the side of the third one only just visible at the back
of the trunk, while the other, though less clear, reveals the group
of three nests rather better. I send them to our Editress in the hope
that they may be found fit for reproduction as somewhat unusual
and interesting.
I have always regretted that I did not at the time ask per-
mission from the owners of the Estancia to cut the supporting
branches away in one piece, after the nesting season--they would
have made quite an interesting museum piece--but the difficulties
of the task, namely the prickly nature and very great weight and
hardness of " espinillo 55 timber, together with the risk of breakage
of the massive nests, which may scale something like ten pounds
each, not to mention the problem of transport, deterred even my,
at that time youthful, enthusiasm.
The Horneros, I believe, invariably build themselves a new
home every year, solid, lasting and laborious in construction though
it be, but I fancy they sometimes use again the broken base of an
old one. Their industry in packing together into so solid a structure
countless pellets, or beakfuls, of mud reinforced with fibrous
material, is really wonderful--and with such a small and slender
beak for trowel.
They are familiar birds about the abodes of men and, besides
the most usual site of a stout branch, generally with a smaller

off-shoot as a support, they choose all sorts of places for their nests--
ridges or beams of sheds or houses, the framing of iron windmills
and water-tanks and, very often, the tops of telegraph posts where
the cross-pieces carrying the wires are fixed. I remember stretches
of line where every post or two bore its Hornero's nest, and in fact
the railway companies send a man from time to time w % ith a long
pole, whose job it is to break them down because they interfere
with insulation.
This is a number of years ago, but I hope the birds are just as
numerous to-day for, apart from this little trouble, they are wholly
useful and desirable, destroyers of many bichitos (small creatures
and insects in general) and most homely and diverting about an
estancia or residence, with their vociferous and cheerful greetings
to one another and the quaint actions accompanying them. I do
not know of any other bird which at times walks, struts almost,
in such a curious way, raising high one foot at a time with a short
pause, rather, I was going to say, like a Hun soldier doing the
goose step--but oh, how much more elegant !
I once found a nest built on the middle of the top bar of a long
tranquera, or paddock gate, some 4 ft. 6 in. high, and fairly often
in use for letting cattle, horses, or wheeled traffic through, but the
birds did not seem to mind at all an occasional swing of a few yards
backwards and forwards of their domicile. The nest was occupied
by a brood of sturdy youngsters, though I only discovered this
through the fact that, thinking it was an old, abandoned one, and
wishing to study the clever construction of the partitioned inner
chamber, I carefully with my penknife cut out a piece two inches
or so square--which, needless to say, I replaced promptly and as
neatly as I could. Happily no harm was done as, riding by a week
later, I found the fledgelings hearty and nearly full grown, though
the parents had not attempted to seal up the breach, as one might
perhaps have expected. It would seem thus that the construction
of these wonderful nests " to pattern ", as in fact of the nest of
every bird, is purely " instinctive " or unreasoned, but it is rather
curious nevertheless that some of them have the entrance to the
right and others to the left, almost as though choice were
exercised, as can be verified from three good examples on view
at South Kensington, two of which have it to the left, while my
two-story nest in the picture has both openings to the right.

One can also detect in the Kensington Museum specimens
the fibrous material which the birds blend into the mud pellets
and also the slight layering of these denoting the builders' daily
progress.
Nobody interferes much with the friendly, if somewhat wary,
Oven-bird, not even, to any extent, the native small boy, who in
my recollection used, at all events, to be very cruel to birds and
other living things, with rarely any consciousness of wrong-doing
towards them : quite a few catapults have I deprived him of.
In fact I used to say that he learned to say malar (to kill) as soon
as he could say mama , but then killing and blood were rather
common sights in open country teeming with, and living by, cattle,
sheep, and other livestock ; perhaps things are better now, through
proper teaching in the State schools, and matter that comes my
way seems to point to a fuller realization in South America of the
value of native fauna and of the ever to be lamented loss that the
destruction of any species implies.
The Hornero is looked upon in fact somewhat in the same light
as the cheery, house-frequenting Robin with us, both recognized
friend of man, not to be killed or molested, and he is the subject
too of country half-beliefs, such as that he always builds facing
the East and never works on Sunday, which, needless to state,
are myths.
The Oven-bird is quite unsuited for life in a cage, though I
recollect once seeing a whole boxfull of them in the old Alsina
market in Buenos Aires : poor active livers in the open ; what for,
and who would buy you ? They cannot have long survived
imprisonment and a probable diet of pulenta and scraps of beef.
But I would like to see a pair by themselves in any Zoo, public or
private, in a spacious aviary, provided with a mud puddle, some
fine hay and hair, and especially with a stout limb of a tree or a
post, say 7 or 8 feet high, on top of which they would quite
likely be tempted to build their massive nest and declaim their
boisterous salutations to each other, to the undoubted entertain-
ment of observers. But, common as the bird is in its own country--
I have often seen them in the public parks and plazas of Buenos
Aires city--I have only met with an odd one or two in European
collections, quite unsuitably housed. With shelter sufficient they
should prove hardy in our climate, like other birds from the Plate,

H. C. MARTIN-A DOUBLE NEST OF THE " HORNERO 55 I
e.g. the Cardinals, grey and green, the White-capped Tanager,
the Black-headed Siskin and other Finches ; all of these I have kept
in perfect health throughout the year in London's outskirts. As
for feeding they would doubtless do well with the diet usually
supplied to the hardier insectivorous birds.
I might add that it may not be very apparent to everybody how
this bird comes to be called Hornero --the oven-maker ; ovens
with us are mostly rectangular iron boxes, but the old-fashioned
Spanish country oven, or homo , is of course a big, round, domed
structure of mud, or sun-dried brick coated with mud, common
enough in the River Plate, Chile, etc., outside ranchos or boliches
(small country inn cum store) and having a rounded opening
in front for firing with brush-wood and withdrawing the ashes
prior to putting in the bread or galletas (hard biscuit). The com-
parison of the nest with an homo is distinctly apt : I have a small
photograph of one, but it is unfortunately not clear enough for
reproduction.
With the photos of the mud nests I found some too of another
" common object of the country ", the nest of the lehatero , or
firewood gatherer, a little bird superficially and in colouring rather
resembling a Tit-lark, but with a pointed tail and having the
curious habit of building up by way of a safe nursery--generally
in a thorn-tree, though sometimes too on an iron telegraph pole or
the posts of a " corral " or the framework of a mill--an enormous
mass of prickly twigs and small branches, so interlaced as to
constitute a veritable fortress, very difficult to break and quite
impenetrable, having only a narrow crooked entrance to the nest-
chamber within ; how so small a bird can work this awkward
material into such a big and solid, though formless, structure is
certainly remarkable. His patience is tremendous, since he lets
fall a very large proportion of the lengthy sticks he gathers, but
never thinks to pick up the dropped piece again.
Looking up the bird in the local library I find that it is
classified under the order Dendrocolaptinoe of which there are
five families, including also Furnarius. Its common name
Lenatero is of course Spanish (Lena = wood), but it seems it is
known by an Indian one too, " Anumbi ", which, together
with its pointed tail, has dignified it with the " Latin " name
of Anumbius acuticaudatus. This order of birds, peculiar to South

America, presents some curious parallels with others entirely

Strange that these two small birds should need such strong and

The Terns and the Guillemots are not, I think, often kept in
captivity except, possibly, in Zoological Gardens, and so a note on
one species of each may be of interest.
In the late summer of 1938, Dr. Derscheid received two Sooty
Terns [Sterna f. fuscata) with a consignment of Waders from a
Dutch dealer.
They were, it seemed, quite young ; they were not wild and
they were not at all sooty, being of a pale bluish-grey above, white
underneath, the long primaries dark grey, and the tail, I think,
rather pale grey. There was some black on the head, but I do
not remember the exact disposition of it, though I think that
approximately the top and back of the head were black and the
face white ; the beak was black, and the tiny webbed feet were
of a dark reddish-brown.
I believe that the birds had been recently caught, but they
were very sensible in an aviary, where we put them with some
small Waders, and did not collide with the wire-netting, but moved
to and fro with the characteristic elegant flight, taking advantage
of every current of air, and making but few movements of the
long wings. At first they ate very small strips of fish and meal-
worms which they would take on the wing from the shallow
water with an effortless grace quite delightful to watch ; but
later, when we had not always got fish, we gave them strips of
bullock's heart which they grew to like so much that, when they
were given fish as before, they would look at it and turn away with

every sign of loathing and disgust, and would only eat it when
they had become very hungry.
They rather liked the small fry which came with shrimps, but
we did not often get shrimps, especially in winter ; they also ate
a little of the Wader's food--chiefly ants' eggs, I think.
These two Terns quarrelled so seriously that we could not
.keep them together ; they did not attack the Waders, though they
were rather unfriendly towards them, making shrill and bitter
protests with open beak whenever a Wader came near to steal
some of their food.
The feet were evidently too small and weak for much walking,
and the Terns rarely took more than a few tottering steps, preferring
to fly wherever they wanted to go. They were fond of bathing,
but I never saw them swim. Early the following year one died,
and in the course of the summer the other seemed to have a kind
of slight moult, for here and there a few blackish body feathers
appeared ; evidently, however, the moult was very incomplete.
At the end of 1939 this one died ; the first had lived in the
collection for about five months, and the second for about fifteen
months, which I thought rather disappointing. Perhaps they
would have done better if we could have fed them on small sea-fish
alone, for the sliced fish would no doubt be a deficient diet, and
the meat and mealworms a far from perfect one.
In the late summer of 1939 two Common Guillemots (Uria
a. aalge ) arrived from Holland. One was of a dull black and
white, and the feathers of the head, which resembled very fine fur
or a piece of silk, were of a rusty black.
The other was also black and white, but there were some areas
of dull white on the sides of the head, and, although this one
showed no buff mottling, we thought that it was young and the
other bird perhaps one of its parents.
The two birds were quite tame, and would take small fish from
the fingers ; they would also take the fleshy part of mussels, but
in offering anything small it was, we found, necessary to be careful
of the very sharp beak.
These two Penguin-like birds, normally stood so that the inter-
tarsal joint became, as it were, the heel or ball of the foot, and
when they walked on the foot proper, they had the appearance
of walking on tip-toe.

Like other piscivorous birds in the collection, they soon acquired
a liking for bullock's heart, and when given a mixture of that and
strips of fish, always left the fish until last.
We kept the two Guillemots only a few weeks, and they went
to the collection of M. Dufour ; we were sorry to see the going
of them but, though they would have looked well on the rocks
round one of the Sea-ducks' ponds, we could not keep them for
they would have destroyed the dwarf rhododendrons and rock
plants growing there.
I have since read that Guillemots whose lives are saved when
they are dying from being covered with waste oil, soon show great
affection for their rescuers ; I quite believe this. I also think
that they are very intelligent, and would be extremely interesting
birds to keep.

In the midst of all the disturbance in their lives caused by the
war my birds here nested as usual, and amongst others hatched
were Splendids and Stanleys. However, perhaps the most interest-
ing brood hatched was a cross between a cock Diamond Sparrow
and a hen Bengalese ! These two birds are in a planted aviary in
which I keep other pairs of Bengalese, Parrot Finches, Ruficaudas,
Diamond Doves, and Chinese Painted Quail.
The Diamond Sparrow cock has his own hen (with whom he
nested last year) ; and the Bengalese--which was bred here in
1939--had her own cock ; but I am afraid they ignored their
lawful mates, the misalliance started and they nested early in
August.
She laid three eggs, threw one out of the nest, and hatched two
fine birds which are fully grown and very smart-looking little birds.
I am unable to sex them, but think now there is one cock and one
hen. One is distinctly more vivid in colouring than the other. They
are both slightly larger than a Bengalese, but not so big as a Diamond

birds have stripes of white, and a lovely vivid red splash of colour
on the top of body and the tail ; reddish beaks, white breasts,
and the bird which I think is the hen has a tufted head !
I should be greatly interested to know if there is any likelihood
of their being fertile, and if one can have any hopes of establishing
this cross, and perhaps a new breed ?
Considering that since September we have had over two
hundred large bombs and land mines dropped on our estate, not
counting hundreds of incendiary bombs, I think it is remarkable
how little alarmed the birds seem, and how few casualties there
have been amongst them.

Last winter my friend, Mr. Dillon Ripley, and I had a certain
measure of success in catching and keeping alive for some time
a number of oil-crippled Sea Ducks, and, as I understand that
oil from disabled vessels has recently taken a terrible toll of European
sea-fowl, and as our methods may perhaps prove interesting to
such members of the Avicultural Society as may have wondered
about the feasibility of taking and keeping such helpless birds,
I shall describe them in full.
The place which we chose for our Duck-catching is Monomoy
Point, a long spit of sand jutting straight southward out to sea
for some 12 miles from Chatham at the elbow of Cape Cod. This

point is uninhabited, except for the members of a coastguard
crew and their families, and for this reason it is a favourite resort
of Sea Ducks, particularly of Eiders.
Almost every winter at some time a raft of these Ducks, swimming
off the point, comes in contact with floating patches of crude oil,
pumped out of some freighter, their feathers become matted
together, and they feel wet and chilled and crawl out on the beach,
hoping to dry themselves. Often they are unable to dive for food
or to fly to their feeding grounds and so slowly starve. Nevertheless,
on an open beach it is usually impossible to approach them on
foot close enough to catch them, and those weakened enough to
be taken thus do not survive in captivity. We have found that if
approached in an automobile, however, the birds will stay still,
hoping that the car will pass, and even the sight of figures standing
on the running-boards will not alarm them.
In Chatham there are garage men with cars who will take one
out to the end of the point and back for a consideration. Surf
fishermen patronize them in the summer and gunners in the fall,
but during the winter they are idle. A certain amount of air is
let out of the tyres of their cars to make them ride over the sand
better, and they drive at a steady rate, about 20 miles an hour,
along certain safe wheel-ruts left by previous cars. I believe the
air-pressure in the tyres of these " beach-wagons 55 is 10 lb. It is
dangerous to risk one's own car in the sand here.
The best time to go after Ducks in this region is late January
and early February. The birds are there earlier, but they must
be given time to get oiled up. On 16th February, 1940, we fell in
with the main flock of oil-cripples for that season, and they were
to be had fdr two or three weeks after that.
When out after Ducks we ride on the running-boards of the
automobile, a long-handled round net in hand, and when just
abreast of the Duck and between it and the water, we ask the
driver to stop and spring off to the chase. In this way, on the
evening of 16th February and the morning of 17th February
last winter, we managed to catch over thirty Ducks out of a flock
of nearly a thousand that had come ashore. Many of these were
able-bodied birds that had decoyed to the rest. Our catch was
mostly Eiders with a few white-winged Scoters, the American
representative of the Velvet Scoter. We have also taken Long-tailed

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999168923076923" page_id="56239182"  page_num="26" year="" vol="">
Ducks in this way. We found that Eiders often " play possum ",
especially when come upon among the dunes out of sight of the
beach, and are docile and even phlegmatic when caught, whereas
Long-tailed Ducks and particularly Scoters, even when weak
from starvation, make every effort to escape and are wild and
violent when caught, snapping at all the other Ducks.
When taken, it is best to get the Ducks as quickly as possible
to the pond or enclosure where they are to be kept and with as
little handling as possible. We have tried to remove the oil and
have found that the extra handling of the bird has nearly always
resulted in its death. The vitality of the oil-soaked cripple is always
more or less low and its primary want is food. Our Eiders were
confined in a hen-house with pans of warm water containing food
and were soon feeding greedily, but, though one or two of our
Scoters fed a little, they were all dead within a week.
When put on a pond in winter the soaking that polluted Ducks
give their plumage in their efforts to rid themselves of the oil
often leads to chills, particularly if they have not learned to take
food yet, and they die. It seems better to confine them in hen-
houses, where their water supply can be limited to a few pan-
fulls in which food has been mixed. They make for the water at
once and so quickly learn to feed. If the weather is severe artificial
heating should help the weaker ones to pull through.
Last winter was a severe one, with temperatures around io* F.
during the nights, and the spring was slow in coming. Into May
there was ice on the pond where we planned to let the Ducks out.
As the result of this hard weather we were not able to shift them
from their winter quarters until the middle of this month and lost
our last male Long-tailed Duck just before we were able to do so.
As soon as the birds have learned to take food regularly and have
been doing so long enough to build up their resistance to cold
and wet again, they should be let out on to a pond, the weather
permitting, where they can wash themselves clean. Our Eiders
become filthy from their long and enforced confinement, but within
a few days of their being liberated on the pond, were as clean as
ever. And what was most remarkable, they seemed to have entirely
nibbled away the clogging oil from their plumage without,
apparently, feeling any ill effects from what they must have
swallowed.

We fed them on dog biscuit at first, later adding pig's liver,
but we feel that there should have been more meat or fish in the
diet. Five Eiders survived until August, when they died in the
moult, which they were very slow at getting into. We feel that
their death was because of our inexperience in keeping Eiders
rather than because of any weakness on their part. Also we have
only been able to give them attention during week-ends most
of the time, a regular farmer attending to their daily feeding,
and this has rather hampered us.
Our experience at this goes no further back than last winter,
and we cannot be said to be experts at keeping Ducks, nevertheless,
we have met with a fair degree of success. I cannot help wondering
what more expert aviculturists could do in the same line. In our
short season's experiments we have found out a number of facts
by which we mean to profit shortly this winter. The most important
of these are : that the oil-crippled bird is fundamentally healthy,
far more so than a shot-crippled one ; that it can easily be caught,
if one knows how ; merely needs food and shelter and, given these,
will slowly remove the oil from itself; that the species commonly
found in this condition are rare or lacking in the average small
waterfowl collection ; that they cannot be taken by the decoys and
lures found so effective in catching surface-feeding Ducks ; and that
it is a kindness to catch them up and temporarily deprive them of
their liberty as, once encumbered with a sizeable patch of oiled
plumage, nothing but slow starvation is in store for them.
[In 1938 the International Committee for Bird Preservation
appointed a Sub-Committee to deal specially with the destruction
of sea birds by waste oil with a view to bringing about effective
international agreement and action in this matter. The Sub-
Committee, which consisted of Lord Justice von Seth (Sweden),
chairman, B. Benzon (Denmark), Count Dzieduszycki (Poland),
H. Drijver (Holland), Marquess Hachisuka (Japan), T. Gilbert
Pearson (U.S.A.), and Miss Barclay-Smith (Great Britain),
secretary, had already begun its preliminary work when the
outbreak of war brought an end to its activities. War conditions
have naturally increased the destruction of sea birds enormously
and conditions are infinitely worse than they were before.-- Ed.]

The Truth about the Cuckoo. By Edgar P. Chance. Price
i2s. 6d. Published by Country Life , Ltd., 2-10 Tavistock
Street, London, W.C. 2.
The name of Edgar Chance will always be associated with
that strangest of all our native birds, the Cuckoo, for no one has
done more than he to elucidate the many problems which a study
of its habits present. His former book, The Cuckoo&amp;apos;s Secret , published
some years ago, recorded many of his observations, but since
then he has had time to confirm or reject some of his earlier
opinions.
While the Cuckoo's egg can always be identified as such, it
varies considerably with different individual birds, but, each female
Cuckoo lays eggs closely resembling one another and differing
from those of other Cuckoos. Hence those who study eggs as
Mr. Chance has done, can say with certainty to which particular
Cuckoo a given egg belongs, a fact that enabled him to recognize
at once an egg as belonging to any particular one of the Cuckoos
that he had under observation.
The first half of the book records the almost daily behaviour
of Cuckoo A or her successors during several laying seasons. The
birds chiefly victimized were Meadow Pipits which were particularly
numerous on certain commons that the author was watching.
The same female Cuckoo returned each year to her special territory
and laid during the season anything up to twenty-five eggs in the
nests of Meadow Pipits for the most part, and one wonders how
any nest could escape the attention of this prolific Cuckoo. But
Nature was not allowed to have her own way entirely on this
common, for the layings were " controlled " by the observer.
It must be understood that the Cuckoo has to lay her egg in a
nest in which those of the fosterer are themselves newly laid,
so that the young imposter is hatched at approximately the same
time as the young of the rightful owners of the nest. Chance
admits that he arranged that there should be nests with fresh
eggs by removing incubated eggs and compelling the Pipits to
lay again. So these experiments, interesting and valuable as they

have proved to be, do not entirely show what would occur in
uncontrolled Nature. Cuckoo A laid, in her fifth season, no less
than twenty-five eggs which is probably considerably more than
she would naturally have laid, as there would have been fewer
Pipits' nests available.
To Chance is due the credit of having discovered the method
by which the Cuckoo's egg is deposited in the nest of the bird to
be victimized. The belief that it was laid upon the ground and
then carried to the nest in the bird's bill, was widespread until
a few years ago, but owing to Chance's observations which have
been fully confirmed by photographic records, it is now known to
be laid directly into the nest, even such nests as those of the Wren
and the Willow Warbler in which the opening is far too small
to admit of the entrance of the body of the Cuckoo. The bird is
able to project the egg from the oviduct into the opening of the
nest, a process doubtless facilitated by the use of its zygodactyl
claws.
The eggs of any one female Cuckoo being distinct from those
of others has provided proof that the same bird returns year after
year to a particular territory, and the author thinks that this may
be true also of the male, as indeed one would suppose it to be,
though proof is difficult to obtain. He goes so far as to suggest
that the Cuckoo pairs like other birds, males and females remaining
faithful to one another, a theory quite contrary to the generally
accepted belief; but he admits that while there seems to be some
evidence in this direction, there is little proof. But surely contrary
evidence of this is strong when we read of one of the Cuckoos
under observation : "At 5.45 she flew off to the forest, and
emitted such a burst of c bubbling ' that in a short while no less
than six Cuckoos were seen flying about together, she apparently
being the centre of attraction."
Concluding chapters deal with other aspects of the life of
this remarkable bird such as the less common types of fosterers
employed and the way in which it adheres to one particular species
as its victim ; in fact there can be little in the habits of the Cuckoo
during its brief stay in these islands that is not dealt with in
this book which those interested in the subject should certainly
read.

In answer to our Editor's appeal in the December Magazine as to which is
the rarest Parrot one has kept, I give here a list of the ones I have had. All are
Amazons except a pair of Racket-tail I once possessed given me by Mr. Spedan
Lewis : Vinacea, Guatemalae, Amazonica , Aestiva, Ochroptera, Ochrocephala , Panamensis,
Auripalliata, Oratrix, Xantholora, Dufresneana, Rhodocorytha, Lilacina, Bodeni, Festiva,
Albifrons, Ventralis , Collaria, Agilis, Savini.
Out of the above list I think I should place the Guatemala as the rarest.
It was the only one I have ever seen. Next the Xantholora is an extremely rare
thing. I believe Mr. Whitley had one if not two. Mine I sold to Mrs. Dalton-
Burgess, who was a great collector of Parrots. I think she also had my Rhodocarytha,
which was a rare one. I think that was the only one I had ever seen and a very
beautiful bird it was.
Two rare Amazons I remember seeing in Mr. Whitley's collection which
I greatly admired. One was the Diademata of which I believe he had two
specimens, but one was an exceptionally beautiful bird. Another rarity of his
was the lovely though gaudy little Pretrei .
I trust other members will send up their rarest specimen, for I am afraid
we shall never see these lovely things again.

The Laughing Kingfisher, Laughing Jackass, Great Brown
Kingfisher or Kookaburra, is one of the best known of Australian
birds, familiar enough to both residents of and visitors to the
south-eastern parts of the great Island Continent who have
penetrated farther than the outskirts of the towns. Its familiar
laughing call, uttered principally in the morning and evening, is
one of the most cheering notes of the Bush. It is a large bird, and
as one sees it flying through the forest, one waits for it to alight on
the limb of a tree to be sure of seeing the tail thrown up* while the
rollicking, laughing call rings through the forest. It is common
enough in the wooded parts, due to the fact that it enjoys strict
protection, in fact it is a great favourite because it has the reputation
of being a snake killer ; and any creature with such habits is well
worth encouraging in a country where these are numerous and
dangerous.
The Kingfishers may be roughly divided into two groups, those
that feed upon fish and those whose diet consists principally of
creatures other than fish. The former are difficult and the latter
easy to maintain in captivity. Of the first group, our European
Kingfisher may be given as an example, while of the second the
Kookaburra is the best known. It is to be found far from water,
a bird of the dense bush where it delights to perch upon an out-
growing branch of a gum tree and carefully survey the ground
around. It has keen sight and any movement at once attracts its

attention. It may be an insect, reptile, batrachian, or fledgling
bird, all are fair game for the Kookaburra which, dropping like
a stone from its perch, seizes the unfortunate creature in its great
bill and carries it back to its perch. If an insect it may be swallowed
immediately, but anything larger, such as a lizard or bird, is quickly
despatched by a series of smart whacks against the perch until
every bone in its body must be broken. Then, with an upward
jerk of the head, the prey is swallowed in one gulp.
The Kookaburra is perhaps not so popular with those who live
close to the bush and keep chickens, for a fluffy young chick is
quite as attractive as a snake or lizard.
For a member of this brilliantly coloured group of birds the
Kookaburra is particularly drab, its principal colour being brown
relieved by blue on the wings and rump. Its territory comprises
the southern parts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia, while it is represented in the northern part of
Queensland and the Northern Territory by the more brilliant
Leach's Kingfisher (D. leichii) which has much more blue on the
wings and a blue tail in the male. A third form, generally regarded
as a sub-species of D. leichii , is the Fawn-breasted Kingfisher
(D. cervina ), with a more westerly range.
The Kookaburra selects for its nesting site the hollow of a tree-
trunk or digs out a hole in a termite's nest. No actual nest is
formed, the three or four glossy white eggs being laid upon chips
of wood on the floor of the cavity. It has bred in captivity on a few
occasions. Dr. Hopkinson records success at the London Zoo in
1905, while the late R. Gosgrave, in this Magazine for 1912,
describes the successful breeding of a pair at Lilford in 1911. His
account is so interesting that I may be excused for quoting from
it at some length. He writes : " About the 20th of last April the
pair showed unmistakable signs of nesting, taking possession of
a box which had been put for some Alpine Choughs. They removed
all the nesting material that it contained ; when I gave more of
different kinds it was at once removed, still they did not place
anything in the box of their own choice or settle to nest in earnest.
It occurred to me that the box was not large enough and that
I was not giving proper nesting material, so I procured another
box, 18 in. by 12 in., with a large hole in front to allow the bird
to go in and out with ease. For nesting material I got some

decomposed wood and broke it up fine, and this was placed in
the box to a depth of about 3 inches. The box I then nailed securely
against the wall of the inside compartment, about 9 feet from the
ground. They at once took to this and on 10th May one pearly
white egg about the size of a bantam's was laid, two more were
added on alternate days and the birds commenced to sit at once.
Incubation lasted twenty-one days, both birds taking equal share
of the work. On the 19th day, finding both birds off the nest
longer than usual at feeding time, I determined to look and see
if all was going well, but met with disappointment, two of the eggs
had vanished, not the slightest trace of them could I find. My
hopes were destroyed for the time being for I felt sure the remaining
egg would share the same fate. However it was not so, the birds
went on sitting and on the 21st day we could hear the young
calling in the nest. When the birds were off to feed I took a hurried
glance but enough to see that the young was perfectly naked.
After ten days I had another look and found that it had grown well,
it was standing or sitting upright and looked like a young Owl
or a ball of white wool. In case of doing harm I did not look at it
again until it was three weeks old ; this time it had developed well
and had feathers all over its body. The wing feathers were well
advanced, and when looked at on the last two occasions it made
a very loud terrified noise which caused the parents to investigate
and me to beat a hasty retreat.
tc When four weeks old the youngster left the nest and
immediately joined its parents in the outer flight, flying with
ease on to the perches which were 7 feet high, and occasionally
resting on the ground under a large box bush to shelter from the
extreme heat. We never saw it go back to the nest ; it would,
however, occasionally fly indoors but only for a few minutes at a
time.
"It appeared to me astonishing the amount of food that was
required during the day to keep the little one quiet. I gave as
large a variety as possible, which consisted of all the caterpillars
that I could get, mealworms, very small pieces of fresh fish, mice,
rabbits, sparrows, sheep's heart, well cleaned gentles, and small
frogs. At the age of four weeks it could eat small mice whole, and
when a large mouse was given it was amusing to see how it would
be knocked against the perch, after the manner of the parents

going through the process of killing. I have never once seen the
female feed the baby. She sat on the perch calmly looking on, and
sometimes she would have a good hearty laugh by way of approval
of the way her mate carried out his domestic affairs.
" Although the baby could fly well when it emerged from the
nest, its tail feathers had only grown about i inch. . . . The bill
is all dark brown ; the eyes black ; feet flesh colour ; breast and
all underparts creamy white thickly covered with very fine light
brown horizontal bars ; mantle and wings like the parents with
one exception, instead of blue on the wing-bars it is light grey."
G. H. Gurney bred this species in 1933 rearing one young bird
which hatched on nth June, and left the nest on 18th July. He
describes the young bird in the nest as " incredibly ugly, with
black naked skin and its huge beak and staring eyes

The Editor of the Avicultural Magazine wrote to the Ministry of
Agricultural and Fisheries on 20th January, 1941, as follows :--
" There are in this country several valuable collections of
water fowl and other birds, for the feeding of which corn, etc., is
essential. The maintenance of these collections is very important
from the scientific point of view, more particularly as the collections
in Belgium and France have been destroyed.
" I should be obliged if you would let me know what steps
can be taken to obtain consideration of allocation of feeding stuffs
for these collections."

for private collections of waterfowl and other ornamental birds,

As a provisional measure in such cases sufficient food to maintain
a nucleus of breeding stock may be allowed but in no case will
the rations available amount to more than 20 per cent of pre-war
requirements of the collection in question. Owners of private
collections of waterfowl should address their applications for ration
coupons to the Feeding Stuffs Officer of their County War Agri-
cultural Executive Committee stating the numbers and kinds and
value of the birds and the quantity of feeding stuffs consumed by
them per month before the war and at present.

Substitute Food for Budgerigars and other Seed-eating Birds
By D. Seth-Smith
While seed is the natural food of Budgerigars and other cage-
birds, they often take readily to other foods such as oatmeal and
breadcrumbs, and even if seed is available, it would be wise to
accustom them to an alternative diet before the seed supply ceases
entirely.
Pieces of stale, preferably wholemeal, bread should be placed
in an oven until brown and then put through a mincer. This
might be mixed with coarse oatmeal and, if available, oats and
a little linseed added. One correspondent finds " Toasted Corn
Flakes " highly appreciated by Budgerigars.
Flowering grass of the small kind known as Poa grass is to be
found growing in waste places from March onwards throughout
the summer and is an excellent food for cage-birds, and chickweed
in seed, which is only too common in most gardens, is also excellent.
The change from a seed diet to any other must be made gradually,
as any abrupt change might prove fatal ; but if brought about
slowly, it should be possible to accustom the birds to do without
seed for the most part if not entirely, especially if various tit-bits
from the table, which most tame birds delight in, are added.
It must be understood that these suggestions are in the nature
of an experiment and no guarantee can be given that they will
prove entirely successful ; but they are well worth trying in view
of the present conditions.
There seems no reason why certain seeds such as canary and
millet should not be grown successfully in this country, though

millet may not ripen properly in a cool summer. If sufficient is
available for sowing it should certainly be tried. It should be
sown thinly, in the spring, care being taken to guard against the
wild birds.
Seeds of plantain and several other wild plants as well as many
kinds of grass, should be collected in the summer as they form a
very valuable diet for cage-birds.
Growing Canary, Millet, and other Seeds
The Editor of Cage-Birds writes in that journal of 28th February :
" It is quite a practical proposition to grow one's own canary
seed in the garden, or on a portion of an allotment.
This seed lends itself to easy cultivation in much the same
way as our wild grasses, while the quality of a home-grown crop
differs little from the imported article.
Its productiveness is highly satisfactory, as the manner of the
canary plant's growth is to send up its main seed head and then
to follow this up with other heads throughout the season.
From early to mid-March is a good planting time, for this
early sowing means that the crop will have the best part of the
summer during which to ripen.
The drills for the seed should be drawn about 1 inch deep and
5 inches apart until roughly 4 feet of the plot has been covered,
when a 9 inch space should be left. The drilling can then continue
for another 4 feet, when again a 9 inch space is left.
The idea of the spaces is, of course, to provide areas for non-
injurious walking among the crops for purposes of hoeing and
gathering the seed heads as they ripen.
Once the seed is in the ground no time should be lost in erecting
black cottons and other popular devices for bird-scaring. These
contraptions should remain on the plot until the plants are well
established.
Germination takes place quickly, and if a few mild days are
experienced the young shoots will soon be seen peeping through
the soil.
When the growths have reached the height of about 6 inches
a light dressing of nitrate of soda or general fertilizer is then hoed

in along the rows, care being taken to ensure that it does not touch
the plants.
Incidentally, this rather generous treatment is not really necessary
on good, normally productive soil.
Canary seed planted in March will have ripened seed heads
in July. When the heads are gathered they should be well dried
and allowed to harden before threshing. But, of course, the plants
can be offered to the birds in a semi-ripe or green state, when they
will be much appreciated. Millet seed can be grown in almost
precisely the same way as canary seed.
It does best in a loose, rich soil, and it germinates with greater
rapidity in warm soil than cold. Plants can be raised by sowing
seeds during February in boxes placed in frames or in a cold green-
house, a seed being sown every inch and 2 inches apart. But in
March sowing can take place in the ordinary way outdoors.
Millet may be fed with every satisfaction in an almost ripe
state so that harvesting problems need not arise.
Parrots and Parrakeets are very fond of kibbled peanuts and
sunflower seed, so sunflowers of the large variety should be grown
wherever possible.
The yield of sunflower seed is increased by dwarfing the plants,
and old mortar forms a splendid manure. The seeds should be
planted 6 inches apart and 1 inch deep. When 12 inches high it
is advisable to mould up the growths.
Great care should be taken to note the state of birds' droppings
when new foods are offered. The aim should be to keep the digestive
organs functioning as normally as possible.
Any signs of looseness or constipation must be corrected by
slightly altering the diet. Fruit and vegetables will be found most
useful as a corrective in either direction."

By W. H. Potter
Yes, I am afraid we all at different times are in the habit of
doing that, some longer than others ; we hardly thank those
who do contribute to our Magazine for the different little tips
they give. If one has been breeding birds for a considerable period
there are bound to be experiences which, if spoken of or put in
print, will be of immense help to others who have started our
fascinating hobby. Many of us keep only the commoner kinds of
foreigners ; this must include myself. Yet even amongst these
there is still a lot to learn about their lives in captivity. My birds
have been through bomb, shrapnel, and land-mine troubles, and
I have found that the little Waxbills, which I have bought at
different times, cannot stand bomb or land-mine blast. Yet all the
Waxbills that I have bred stand up to it well. One land-mine that
fell very near blew out all my heater lamps, broke doors open
and locks, yet no glass was broken, or wire, or windowlite. I find
all birds from a Linnet upwards in size take no notice of gunfire
or anything else, but below this size one has to take care. Regarding
food, some of you may have seen my article in Cage Birds , for those
who have not it is as follows : In the seed for Waxbills and small
foreign seed eaters I put, after mixing in separate container, oats,
bone meal, nature food, with chicken biscuit meal. One spoonful
of each. Then another week I change it to Mosquito, Egglisco,
and bone meal. Then following week, condition food, nature food,
and bone meal. Then another week just biscuit meal. Making
these many changes seems to suit the birds well. All are in tip-top
condition. Later on milk sop, with Osborne biscuit or sponge
cake is given. When mealworms became scarce I started breeding.
First of all a box 2J feet square and high was made, a layer of
meal, pollards, and bran was put between layers of sacking and
rolls of screwed up paper. Three hundred mealworms, and one
hundred beetles were introduced. Between each layer cut up
apple one time, cabbage leaves another, were introduced. Once
a week fresh apple or greenstuff was renewed. Box was put into
small Waxbill aviary to be close to one of Thomas's heater lamps.
Now I have mealworms in all states of growth, the box seems alive
with them. No, I have not taken the trouble to count them, it is

quite satisfactory to see so much food in the making. It gives me
the opportunity of letting the Waxbills have the small ones now
and again. My cock Combassou is a little " pig " for them, but he
deserves some encouragement for blitz or no blitz he is continually
singing, and he has not changed from full plumage yet, having
been over a year in colour. Just one feather in flight shows a change.
My cock Paradise Wydah last year came into colour on 31st July,
1940, and tail was not complete till 30th August, 1940. It has this
time quills which were as long as its tail would be to break through.
This I have not noticed before, he is now in his ninth year ; perhaps
age is the cause. The tail feathers broke at the end of these long
quills, gradually splitting them upwards towards body of bird.
When feathers had extended to full length of quills, they dropped ;
that is to say the quill cases left the bird. My cock Orange Bishop,
whom I have had just as long, came into colour 16th May, 1940,
completed colour 28th June, 1940 : both Paradise Wydah, Orange
Bishop, and Red-headed Weaver never dropped out of colour
till first week of January this year. Now I want to issue a warning
about Orange Bishops ; these incorrigible rogues, as age mounts up,
seem to get spiteful. During the breeding season of last year
I could not make out why some of my birds that I picked up dead
had a hole in back of head. This was happening more with the
young birds on leaving their respective nests. First a pair of English
Siskins, then a Chaffinch, then a Mealy Redpoll, then young
Greenfinches. At first I thought it was Owls, then cats, but as
I have double netting all round my aviaries this proved me wrong.
To one whom birds are part of self it was making me feel Sad,
till one day I spotted the cause : busy hammering away at a young
Chaffinch's head on the ground was that lovely devil the Orange
Bishop, he knew he had been spotted at last, but was he going to be
64 caught up "--not he. So I had to wait for nightfall before he was.
Next day he was put into a small cage, and introduced into aviary
again for a fortnight, then let loose once more. It certainly seemed
to sober him up as the other birds had worried him a great deal
while in cage. No further trouble was experienced in this aviary
for the rest of the season. It is only when bird is in full colour that
he is spiteful. I had doubts when he was let loose again, but even
birds suffer from inferiority complexes at times. Never for one
moment is he ever able to stop from nest building, nearly every

bush or position is decorated with his work, and if you have the
sauce to watch him he turns his back on you, throws over all the
colour he can by puffing himself out, making that sibilant noise
all the time, as much as to say, what do you think of me. I feel
sure he knows he's creating a stir. Watching him in a far distant
corner is master Redhead. He I have never seen make a nest,
but as soon as the Orange Bishop leaves his work, like a meteor
he's on it, tearing it to bits. Then the Bishop spots him, master
Redhead hangs underneath nest, while the other gives him a
piece of his mind. When the Redhead has had enough he retires,
later to go through the whole performance again ; no feathers
are lost over these arguments, and the Orange Bishop seems to
like to crow after it each time. Even out of colour he still makes
nests. My African Fire Finches had two nests last year, then
the hen bird died in full plumage and good health apparently.
If it had not been for the war the bird would have been sent for
post mortem. This I have had happen before, after breeding with
the hens. Yet if one has an aviary bred pair it does not happen ;
perhaps the real cause is age of purchased birds, strain being too
much in rearing two nests. I had often wondered how the parents
found the place to put the food as the nests are very dark inside
of some of their positions. One day an opportunity came my way
of looking inside a nest, and this is what I saw. As the little mites
opened their bills a white luminous spot was seen in their throats,
also another spot either side of beak. This even to me showed up
well so it must have been even better to the parents to locate their
mouths. Just a little over six weeks after leaving nest they lost
these spots. Ants' eggs, fresh daily, and small mealworms, also
greenfly were given.
My Cuban Finches reared two nests in a privet bush ; their
nest or nests seemed to have an entrance both ends of what seemed
two small grass balls joined together, the same being used for
second nest. Bomb blast killed the hen after second nest. When
the young cocks come into colour, just under two months, and you
have them caged up it is, I find, necessary to separate them, as
they begin to fight. Unfortunately I lost one before it was noticed
by me. Young Waxbills of all species when caged up seem to
delight in denuding one another of feathers. Putting hens in one
cage, cocks in another, and of different species seems to cure it

a great deal, also for a time stopping any tit-bits. Many other
Waxbills had eggs or young when Jerry started his nonsense and
upset their labours. So unfortunately, what with our many other
duties, many of us have had to put avicultural activities in the
background. When this trouble is over there should be many
interesting stories to relate to our many friends in different parts

Barraband Parrakeet. --These birds have always been very
disappointing. Each year they have hatched young but have killed
them when about a week old. This year the eggs were transferred
to a hen Queen Alexandra paired to a Green-winged King and
three young were reared.
Pennant's Parrakeet. --Four eggs laid, two young successfully

days and twenty-eight days.
Crimson-winged Parrakeet. --Four eggs were laid but all
were infertile.
Turquoisine x Elegant Parrakeet. --Two eggs laid and
only one young one reared.
Guilding's Amazon. --This pair has again disappointed us.
They laid only one egg, but would not incubate it for more than
a week.
Among the other birds breeding results were very poor, in
some cases this was due to the shortage of mealworms and in others
the birds being frightened by bombs and gunfire.
Crested Bronze-wing Pigeon. --Three eggs hatched, only
one reared.
Bronze-wing Pigeon. --Two hatched and only one reared.
Snow Pigeon. --Two eggs hatched but none reared.
Black-wing Dove. --Four eggs hatched but none reared.
Ashy Dove. --Two eggs hatched but none reared.
Jackson's Thrush. --Three young ones hatched but none
reared.
Madagascar Weaver. --Two young ones hatched and reared.
White-headed Robin Chat. --Two young hatched but none
reared.
The following birds nested but did not hatch any young :--
Rothschild's Grackle, Orchard Finches, Silver-eared Mesias,
Kookaburas, Shamas, Loochoo Jays, Purple-headed Glossy
Starlings, Blacksmith Plovers, and Pekin Robins.
In the animal enclosure a good many Mandarins and
Carolinas were reared, also some Madagascan Divers (Thalassornis ),
Emperor Geese, Snow Geese, and Bar-headed Geese. A good
many White Peafowl and Black-shouldered Peafowl and Crested
Guinea-fowl. It has been a very disappointing year for Cranes,
and, although a good many birds nested and hatched their young,
only one Demoiselle Crane was reared. Seven Stanley young ones
were hatched, also two White-necked and four Sarus Cranes,
none reared. The young White-necked died when nearly two
months old. Any number of Chukor Partridges were reared,
over fifty in my garden.

Museum one of the most vivid is of seeing suddenly in a good light
a fine specimen of the Ocellated Turkey. I had no idea that any
such bird existed and I have felt ever since that this must be one
of the supremely desirable species for any collection.
Accordingly, when Monsieur Delacour invited me in, I think
it must have been, 1938 to join with him in arranging for an
importation, I, accustomed as I am to conform readily to his
initative in any such matters, did so with special alacrity.
There have been, I think, very few importations. In a recent
note Dr. Vevers wrote to me from the Zoological Gardens that
" when I first came to the Gardens we had an odd bird on the
north bank, but this, I think, is the only one we have ever had ".
From a short article, that Mr. Seth-Smith contributed some
years ago to the Avicultural Magazine , I gathered that he did not
think this Turkey likely to do well in captivity. But I had heard
that a cock--the bird, I imagine, that Dr. Vevers mentioned--
lived in Regent's Park for eight years and died by accident, so to
that extent there seemed to be some hope that the species might
become established in Europe as has its near relative.
Our collector brought over, I believe, rather fewer than a
dozen birds. My share was two cocks, of which one had a damaged
wing, and three hens.
I think I remember that Monsieur Delacour told me that in
certain districts the species is plentiful but very hard to capture
and the young very hard to rear to the age at which they stand
captivity well.
On these grounds we paid for our specimens a price pretty
formidable for any bird, however beautiful and however likely
to breed well, and specially formidable in the case of a species of
which the progeny, if any, are not likely to sell freely.
The bird is so handsome that I was a little surprised to be told,
after our own had arrived, that, if we were to succeed in rearing
a good many, we should probably find that they were not much
in demand. I was told that this would be so partly because some

people would think that a Turkey could not be very interesting
and partly because the birds need a good deal of space but most
of all because in winter they need a warmed house.
Even, however, if I had happened to be told this before I had
decided to join in Monsieur Delacour's venture, I should, I think,
have still felt inclined to make at least one attempt to throw light
upon the possibility of establishing the species in the aviaries of
Europe. Even if it is not much wanted for private collections, it is
extremely suitable for public zoos.
I have considered quoting here the description in the catalogue
of the British Museum but the colouring is so complex that I think
it would be hardly a good use of the Magazine's space.
The bird is a rather small Turkey. As in the Green Peacock,
both sexes are very much alike with no such difference as the
" tail " makes in the Peacock. The head and neck are slim and
elegant, not heavy and apoplectic as in a farmyard Turkey-cock.
There is no hanging wattle on the top of the head.
The skin of the head and neck is bare and light blue. It is not
glossy. Both sexes have on the head a number of small protuberances.
They are reddish orange. The flight feathers are striped white and
dark brown. The lower part of some of the other feathers, notably
those of the tail, is a medium grey. Their ends and the whole of
the remainder of the plumage is metallic. So much of the plumage
is glossy and the total effect is so gorgeous that one is tempted
to try to give an idea of the bird's general appearance by inviting
one's readers to imagine a Humming-bird the size of a small
Turkey.
That there is a certain amount of justification for that summary
may be judged from the fact that the following words occur in
the British Museum description : 4 4 grass-green . . . greenish copper
. . . gradually increase in brilliance . . . colours attain their greatest
magnificence . . . brilliant greenish-blue bands changing to purple
. . . rich copper-red with green reflections . . . mostly golden green
with shades of dark blue and narrow black margins . . . reddish
copper shot with golden green and purple and shading into greenish
gold."
All our five birds were young. I think I remember that Monsieur
Delacour told me that the collector had reared them from eggs.
In the first winter we kept them in a warmed house on a concrete

floor with an open concrete run. At the beginning of the summer
we moved the undamaged cock and two of the hens to one of our
Pheasant-runs (these are 72 ft. by 18 ft. by 9 ft. high) and, after
a time, we opened the door of an adjoining run and gave them
the double space. Here they seem to be doing well all the year
round. In winter they have a small shed about the size of a bathing-
machine, warmed by an oil lamp. On mild days they are let out.
One hen died in the first winter and Monsieur Delacour lost,
I believe, both his cocks. At all events he sent us one of his hens.
Our damaged cock proved useless and in the breeding-season
the hen, who shared his run, killed him. It is painful to think of
a bird's suffering all the distress of capture and the journey and
then coming to such an end and we wished, of course, that we had
given him separate quarters. But there had been no signs of trouble.
The surviving cock seems first-rate. On arrival he was plainly
immature. Last spring must have been his first breeding-season.
For about three months he was very fierce and during that time
lost one of his spurs. I am told he kicked it off against a bucket.
Obviously those, who go in with birds as fierce as this, should
carry some means of defence against which the birds cannot hurt
themselves. The knocking off of a spur is said to be apt to lead to
fatal haemorrhage. If so, we were lucky not to lose the only cock
in Europe and to find ourselves with three forlorn widows.
The cock's aggressiveness supports a suspicion, that I have
heard expressed in high quarters, that the accident, from which the
Zoo's cock died, occurred when he was being repelled by someone
whom he was attacking.
He displays much like his farmyard relative and chiefly in the
morning. If we can get a photograph of that this year the Magazine
shall have it.
Out of the breeding-season our cock is very quiet and friendly.
So are the hens. So far as my own experience goes all game birds,
however tame, are apt to start away at any but the very slowest
movement. These four Turkeys strike me as rather specially
nervous in that sense but not in any other.
Of the three hens one seems to be always close to the cock
while the other two keep a little way off. We are not quite certain
whether the hen, that is thus in close attendance, is always the
same, but it is thought that she is probably the bird that reached

us later from Cleres and that she is older than the other two.
Though two hens are always quite definitely separate, they do not
keep so far off as to suggest that they are frightened or on bad terms.
When they are shut up in the house one hen sits by the cock and
the others on another perch, but that amount of room seems
enough to prevent any trouble. In fact they are quite good-
tempered among themselves and they have the further merit of
being apparently no trouble to moult.
Last year, between the 20th May and the 30th June the hens
laid upwards of thirty eggs. So many of these were dropped from
perches that the perches had to be lowered and boxes filled with
straw placed under them.
I did not see any of the eggs but I am told that they resemble
that of the ordinary Turkey but are " perhaps a little smaller
The hens seem to have laid indiscriminately anywhere. Incubation
took twenty-six days.
Of all these eggs nineteen, that is to say slightly over half, were
hatched. Many of the chicks seemed very promising. But it appears
that on this ground Turkey-poults get black-head and at about
six weeks old all but two of these died. The two seem good birds.
One is luckily a cock. Next year we shall try keeping the chicks
off the grass and, if this device succeeds there is, to judge from last
year's results, a good hope of building up a flock.
It is, of course, very unfortunate that we have only one cock,
but there seems to be a good chance that the hens are unrelated
and it is, I believe, fairly certain that one at all events is a good
deal older than the others.
The birds are very silent. The cock grunts or clucks a little
and the hens have a very small cluck. They seem to be purely
diurnal. They are always out of doors when allowed and, like
most of our Pheasants, even of those that commonly spend much
of the day in their sheds, they roost out if they can and always get
as high as possible.
We feed them just like Tragopans. They show no taste at all
for meat and seem to prefer fruit and cooked vegetables to grain.
It will be seen from this that our experience so far has been
much more encouraging than that upon which Mr. Seth-Smith
based the article to which I have referred.

By A. H. Scott
Wordsworth, it seems, could not endure that waterfalls should
be mentioned in his presence. That lesser men should express
their measly sentiments on a subject so peculiarly his own was not
to be tolerated. Though all arrogance is very disagreeable I must
admit that in this little matter of Sparrows I regard the opinions
of others with a certain disdain ; for who else has ever troubled
to keep scores of these despised birds over a long period of years,
or to study with affectionate solicitude the daily details of their
domestic life ? Certainly none of those writers who have joined
in a general conspiracy to libel a lowly creature of unusual innocence
and virtue. The Jackdaw of Rheims was cursed by a bishop with
bell, book, and candle, but in these days it is a still graver disaster
to encounter the enmity of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the horrid
innuendoes of British Birds , or the highly coloured invective of
rOiseau. These authorities, followed by daily dishers-up of nature
notes, novelists and scribblers of all kinds, have made the Sparrow
an object of contempt.
The Britannica , with its usual pose of impartiality, suggests
that the Sparrow may " perhaps " be considered a parasite on man.
This disgusting word now suggests the horridest sorts of insects,
but we might accept the term if used in its old original meaning
of a poor man about town who takes his meals at the table of a
rich patron. After all there are, in days of peace, many young
men who own nothing but a good dress suit, live in one room,
and dine out every night : and if they are witty and agreeable
their hostesses feel well paid. The French have an amusing slang
term for such a person, and call him a pique-assiette or " plate
pricker ". We might agree that the Sparrow is a plate-pricker,
a poor citizen who, in return for his meals, brings in cheerfulness
and entertainment. But whatever may be said of the town Sparrow,
no such term can be applied to his country cousin. The farmer
has no crumbs to spare and does not wish to be cheerful, but to
have reasons for grumbling, and these the Sparrow supplies. He
also eats a great number of insects, thus giving his host at once
a moral and material return for the advantages obtained, namely

stolen corn and nice deep holes in the thatch for nesting and sleeping
purposes.
It is obvious that there is a definite mutual advantage, and
that the relationship is not one of parasitism, but of symbiosis.
Symbiosis, I should perhaps say, is a sort of sexless matrimony,
or permanent cohabitation between creatures of different species
for mutual service. Nature is full of strange instances of these
often very unfair arrangements.
The worst calumny on the Sparrow is found in The Handbook
of British Birds which, in half a dozen words, utterly ruins his
reputation. " The Sparrow. . . . Sexual conduct requires investiga-
tion." A most objectionable and unfounded suggestion. If we
must go about investigating sexual conduct why not begin with
that big ugly foreigner who keeps his wife enclosed in a tree-hole
for weeks at a time ? He is the fellow on whom we ought to have
an eye, for obviously his wife is in no position to do so. This is
the favourite theme of the Sparrow hater : he is an indecent,
promiscuous and ribald creature. " Ignoble vermine," cries
VOiseau , " pullule partout." I will not translate these words :
let them remain decently veiled in the slight obscurity of a foreign
language. All Sparrows should be abolished from our towns in
the interest of morality, says a character of H. G. Wells, and even
Shakespeare, out of his vast armoury of epithets, chooses the ugliest
for this harmless bird. Angelo, in " Measure for Measure ", is
so strict that " Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves because
they are lecherous ". This is grossly unfair. Other birds may have
their lonely moor, sea cliff, or leafy arbour,
" Some melodious plot
of beechen green and shadows numberless."
but the poor Sparrow must perform his pure connubial rites on
a roof-top in full view of every gossiping ornithologist.
The origin of all these prejudices is not easy to discover. Modern
psychologists, when they wish to hunt out the cause of our
antipathies, misfortunes, or diseases, usually hark back to the days
of our infancy, and find in the lamentable errors of our parents
and nurses the hidden source of all our troubles. They would
probably assert that it is the childish rhyme about " Who killed
Cock Robin " which has given us a deep but unconscious hatred
of Sparrows, though anybody who has tried to breed Robins

knows that they kill each other with gusto, and that the
hero of the story was doubtless murdered by his brother or his
father. Very probably this incompetent bard was unable to think
of any rhyme for arrow except Sparrow ; and as we find that
Shakespeare (in the Merchant of Venice) uses the very same jingle,
derived perhaps from childish memories, some force is lent to the
suggestion, which is no more fantastic than many of the sorceries
of the psycho-analysts. They might even go back a couple of
thousand years to Lesbia and her Sparrow. The English poets
have praised many birds : they have been charmed by the Robin,
roused to ecstasy by the Skylark, and even paid compliments to
the tender heart of the ridiculous Pelican ; but they have ignored
the clever and amusing Sparrows. Yet the " Elegy on Lesbia's
Sparrow " had a far wider fame than any ode to Skylark or
Nightingale, and was familiar to every schoolboy during the long
centuries when education meant Latin and a birch-rod.
" Loves and Graces mourn with me,
Mourn fair youths, where're ye be,
Dead my Lesbia's Sparrow is,
Sparrow that was all her bliss. ..."
Catullus goes on to describe a very tame and attractive pet,
and to lament that his Lesbia's eyes are red with weeping over
its death. One would suppose that the Sparrow, like other birds
which have since been celebrated by the poets, would have worn
for ever after a literary halo protecting him from persecution and
calumny ; but Lesbia was beautiful, and in spite of her exquisite
sensibility, very far indeed from being as good as she ought to
have been. Inevitably people have been more interested in the
lady than in her bird : thus, not only did she steal the poem, but
the poor Sparrow died in the odour of impropriety, which may
well have clung to him as he travelled down the ages in company
with his beloved mistress.
Practical persons will declare that this is all nonsense, and
demand that if I have really anything new to tell them about
Sparrows I should hurry up about it. But let them consider a
little. The Editor of our Journal pays me nothing for my hard
work. If my labours were remunerated with adequate subsidies
and emoluments I would trudge straight along the dull high road
of my subject and deliver with punctuality and dispatch my meagre

little parcel of discoveries. But we contributors work, as the phrase
goes, for love : and since we have as our employer, not the usual
old curmudgeon with undiscriminating blue pencil, but a delightful
young lady, who would hate to hurt a comma, the most miserly
scribe ought indeed to be satisfied with this immaterial reward.
But do we in fact receive any of this love ? By no means and
far from it. We are objects of no interest at all, mere instruments
of her trade. And since this is the case, since I receive neither
love nor money, shall I not dawdle along at my own pace, wander
off the road, or stand and stare at whatever interests or amuses
me ? Theories and ideas are free and pleasant, whereas facts are
tough, dry, and indigestible : we shall come to them in due course,
without forgetting, however, that when we are only concerned
with the accumulation of facts we are like savages collecting their
beads and shells, but that when we speculate on their causes
and relationships we become sages and philosophers.
Whatever its remote causes may be, the contempt for Sparrows
is due first to their numbers round our houses, and secondly to
their dingy appearance. " Sparrows," says a well-known writer
on birds, C# being vermin, breed like rats--and Russians," thus
echoing the vituperation of VOiseau. This author, who is a soldier,
uses a decisive and military style, but here he is wrong. In the
first place, though we may wander in many byways when discussing
ornithology, we must keep clear of politics. A birdy Communist
should surely be free to read about his hobby without receiving
a painful and gratuitous dig in the most sensitive region of his
mind : nor was Tolstoi produced by a race of vermin. As for the
great fertility of the Sparrow it is a myth. The record production
for a hen Sparrow in my aviaries was nine young : Greenfinches
have exceeded twenty, and a Thrush broke all records by laying
over fifty eggs between mid-February and early October. The
Thrush eggs were nearly all infertile, of course, but she reared a
brood in October. As aviary records may differ from those set up
in complete freedom I have some twenty boxes for wild Sparrows
nailed up on stables, a garage, and sheds, and check when I can,
the behaviour of my own birds by the action of the wild ones.
I had noticed for many years that wild Sparrows' nests usually
contain some addled eggs, and last year I examined fifteen of these
boxes and noted down the contents when the young were partly

grown. The average number was just under 2 J, and all the nests
but two contained one or more addled eggs. Fifteen nests are
not enough for an exact conclusion, but we shall be on the safe
side in believing that the average number of young reared does
not exceed three. Does the Sparrow practice family limitation
and expose his eggs to draughts, as the ancients used to expose
their unwanted children upon a mountainside ? Perhaps he does,
though my observation rather inclines me to the idea that he fails
to do his share of incubation properly, not from any Stopesian
notions, but because he is so fond of his wife that he dallies with
her when he should be sitting. After all, if they sit alternately all
day and sleep all night, what chance has the Sparrow, who is not
only a faithful but an uxorious husband, to enjoy his wife's society ?
I am familiar with only very few species of birds and wish that
someone with extensive knowledge would tell us whether more
addled eggs are usually found in the nests of birds which share
incubation : on the principle of too many cooks spoiling the broth
this may possibly be the case.
Sparrows are late nesters, and my Greenfinches are normally
about a month earlier in starting. They also end sooner and
I should say, rarely rear more than three broods, a maximum,
only once exceeded by a keen breeder in my aviaries. Moreover
they appear to be far more numerous than they really are because
they follow man and, of course, are very scarce in the great open
spaces or forests. Twice I have built myself a house in woods,
cutting down trees to make a space for it, and each time no Sparrows
were seen till a year had passed by, though there were many other
birds. They also seem to have many young ones because their
families stay with the community during their first summer, whereas
other birds mostly scatter very quickly. Each spring I put coloured
rings on various young birds, and see very few of them after they
have left their nests : only the Sparrows remain. Sometimes I have
fed young Blackbirds or Thrushes in their nests, sharing the work
with the parents, and have put them in a cage for safety until old
enough to fly strongly. The parents seemed to appreciate the
good intention and themselves came to be fed with the young ones
after they were liberated. These all stayed near the house for
several weeks, but disappeared as soon as the feeding ceased.
The fact that Sparrows live in such close communities is itself

a proof of good character, for there can be no stable society without
the rule of law backed by public opinion. Men are so dependent
on this restraining influence that many atrocities have been
committed by whites in the wilds of Africa, and those who remain
virtuous are said to put on their dress clothes every night in the
jungle, thus setting up a sort of idol or image representing civilized
public opinion. I am sure, if the suggestion is not irreverent,
that if our first parents had not been alone, if a dozen other couples
had been placed in their isolated Eden, a tabu on the fatal tree
would have been more effective than divine ordinance. The fact
that Sparrows are dingy little birds is really another indication
that their character is exceptionally good. It is generally admitted
that the wonderful colours of the various Pheasants and other
gaudy birds are due to sexual selection, which is only another way
of saying that the females have invariably married for looks, while
the dull birds have chosen their mates for some other reason ;
obviously, in the case of the Sparrows, intelligence and fidelity.
Exceptional beauty has hardly ever been associated with high
moral character. Juvenal, in his Satire on the Vanity of Human Wishes ,
urges young women not to pray in the temples of the Gods for
beautiful children : for, says he, the parents of a very handsome boy
are always anxious and miserable, and he is sure to turn out a
dissolute rascal. The character of the Pheasant tribe is so notorious
that no one would ever trouble to investigate their objectionable
habits, while the modest little Partridge is an example of every
domestic virtue. The angelic voice of the sombre Nightingales,
since first they sang, may well have converted sinners and restrained
murderers prowling through the night, while the raucous cries
of the swaggering Peacock sounds like the lamentations of the
damned. Evidently, when we see a Quaker dress we may expect
a Quaker virtue, and the following incidents are a sufficient proof
that if the Sparrow errs it is only in the manner of our grand-
parents, by a rigid intolerance, and a nasty inclination to persecute
the weak sister rather than the weak brother.
Up to 1935 I had always kept in any aviary an equal number
of cocks and hens, but that summer I had an extra hen which
I wished to use, and placed her with three couples in a planted
aviary which was 1 o yards in length, 7 in width, and about 15 feet
high. I never saw any of the cocks take any notice of her, though

I generally sat in this aviary for an hour or two each day. Neverthe-
less she built and laid, and carried out alone the incubation ;
having indeed little temptation to leave her nest, since, when she
was obliged to do so, the other hens immediately attacked her.
After a few weeks she was more than half-plucked and presented
a pitiable appearance, the more so that she lived in a state of
constant fear, and yet bravely ministered so far as she could to
the wants of her two stunted little ones. Stunted they were, and
weakly, for their mother was never allowed to approach the meal-
worms, or maggots, but fed them on seed, bread, and such very
few insects as she could catch in the aviary. It was a painful spectacle
which would have moved Dickens to his deepest abyss of pathos,
and at last I was disgusted. " Odious little birds," I thought,
"just wait until next year." Long ago, in far off Edwardian days,
I had the happy fortune to have a talk with George Meredith at
Box Hill : or rather, since I was diffident, and the old man was
then at the very height of his vogue and fame, I sat silent, while,
propped on pillows in his reclining chair, Meredith declaimed in
his brilliant high-comedy style on life in general and marriage in
particular. One of his remarks recurred to me. " I don't regard
marriage as a sacrament : I consider it a convenient arrangement.
If for any reason the balance of the sexes were seriously upset we
should recognize the fact and promptly change our views." I had
doubted this opinion, and was now interested to see how these
puritanical birds would behave under such new circumstances.
The following season I placed in the same aviary three cocks and
six hens. Whether they held a " Rook's caucus " to discuss the
position I don't know, but the action taken appeared to be based
on unanimous decision. The cocks paired, each with one hen,
and behaved to outward appearance as if the three extra hens did
not exist. Although I watched daily I never saw any irregular
mating, and the fact that the odd hens hatched out young ones
was the only proof of such mating having occurred. There was
no quarrelling, and all the hens were quite friendly. There was
perhaps an official statement that in future all young birds born
out of wedlock should be considered to be cases of parthenogenesis,
which, according to the most ancient traditions, is a very honourable
origin indeed. In any case the flag of monogamy was nailed to
the mast. This strict devotion to decorum is naturally based on

strong and exclusive attachments, and Sparrows baulked of their
chosen mate will by no means promptly console themselves with
another. I had at one time two cocks which I specially wished
to mate to two particular hens, and therefore kept each pair
separately throughout the winter. In April I released all four birds
together in a large aviary, but at the end of a week or two was
annoyed to find that they had exchanged partners, and would
obviously defeat my intentions if allowed. I therefore separated
them again, each pair having a large aviary with the company
of a pair of Greenfinches. They were obviously upset and restless,
and as the weeks went by I saw that they would prefer celibacy
to an undesired mate : by the middle of June it appeared useless
to persevere, so I caught one of the cocks and let him go in the
other aviary. Without even alighting on the way he flew straight
to the hen, and mated her instantly.
It may be objected that cock Sparrows in the spring go courting
a number of hens, two or three being seen at a time trailing their
wings and cocking an amorous tail in front of one hen after another ;
but this does not disprove my contention that their unions are
based on very strong attachments. Sparrows with all their posturing
and torso displays, express in most cases, not passion, but only a
nonchalant conventional submission to the eternal feminine ; and
when Cupid has truly launched his dart very little time is wasted
over these preliminary compliments.

In these eventful days we have special cause to be thankful
to those our " kith and kin " who, though they live " right under ",
do not forget the claims of kinship, and stand so bravely beside us
in this war. All aviculturists owe a debt to Australia for possession
of those lovely Parrots and Parrakeets peculiar to that country.
In our Magazine--now almost venerable--we have colour prints
of these with an article describing each illustration. There are
also informative articles upon the breeding of same in days of
yore ! May I make a suggestion here ?--that very interesting
contributions might be sent to the Editor containing information
gained recently by those who have successfully bred Australian
Parrots and Parrakeets. It is the personal effort and the methods
used by the owner of perhaps one or two pairs of these birds which
are very interesting to many of the smaller breeders amongst the
members of the Avicultural Society. Unfortunately I cannot
supply such particulars, but enjoy reading them.
I have to thank Australia for some beautiful colourful Finches.
Some time back I owned Diamond Sparrows, Painted, Zebra,
and Double-bar Finches. Also Pictorella, Blue Faced, Star, and
Long-tailed Finches. Just now I concentrate upon the Painted
Finches and the Gouldians as they seem still to be in request.
Last year (1940) two pairs of Painted shared an aviary and
went to nest. The second pair, though they hatched six birds
did not carry on well when the first pair was removed indoors
owing to a chill caught by the cock on a cold night. They do
not seem to like the routine to be disturbed ! The young birds
of the first nest flew well and are now adults.
Two pairs of Red-headed Gouldians and one pair of Black-
heads went to nest last August. They had nice numbers of eggs--
all fertile. No. 1 pair Red-headed hatched out eight birds, and
No. 2 pair hatched out five. The Black-headed pair had six fertile
eggs, but I failed to observe that she was being disturbed by the
cock of the second pair. I removed the Black-heads elsewhere,
but they did not settle down.
Owing to cold nights and other conditions I have all my birds

all day and begin to show colour.
We have to ration seed rigorously, but we hope to carry on.
Some self-sown plants of millet which were dried have been much
appreciated by the youngsters. Good grit, charcoal, and cuttle-fish
are always available for them with the seeding grass.

The African continent and its islands are rich in Parrots, many
species of which are known in Europe and deserve to be noted as
objects of interest and pleasure for the aviculturist.
I will commence with the true genus Psittacus. Of this genus
the best known is the Grey Parrot, commonly called Jaco. It is
said that this bird was known also to the Romans, and it is certain
that if they were acquainted with this species they must have had
a great fondness for it, as it is known that the old Romans had a
cult for Parrots. More than one writer of those times mentions
them and speaks of the large and magnificent aviaries in which
they were kept. In all ages writers in almost every country have
mentioned this bird. The German naturalists especially have in
the past studied it, describing its intelligence and giving it a rich
variety of names. The Grey Parrot, for example, is known by
many names ; the most common are :--
Psittacus erithacus, L. Sep. Beht Shw. Khl. Wgl. Finsch and
many others.
Psittacus cinereus s. subcaruleus Aid. Willoughby, Ray, etc.
Psittacus cinereus cum cauda rubra Frsh. Klin.

The Grey Parrot is of the size of a Turtle Dove, though there
are specimens somewhat larger or smaller. It is a beautiful ash
grey, the breast and belly being almost white, while the short
tail is bright red. The beak is large and strong and ebony black.
The feet are dark and the claws black.
Dr. Greene observed that in the young birds the colour of the
feathers and the feet is darker than in the adult specimens and
says also that the eye of the young bird is pale grey, becoming
yellowish with the passing of time, but I have not been able to
verify these interesting data. The area of the white skin on the
face of the female is more circular in shape.
Some naturalists have observed that Grey Parrots have a
greater or lesser number of red feathers. There are also albino
examples of this species. One of these was purchased by Lord
Tavistock as an addition to his fine collection of Psittaciformes,
which to-day is one of the best possessed by a private individual.
This curious specimen was quite white, with the exception of the
tail which was of the usual red. It is now stuffed and preserved
in an English museum. There are other grey specimens which
have white instead of red tails. I am of opinion that these cases
are too rare for the creation of a new species, they are commonly
regarded as freaks of nature and certainly are curious anomalies
of the species Psittacus erithacus.
Lord Tavistock says that anyone who had the good fortune
to procure a pair of young birds of this species, could induce them
to breed here without great difficulty. Their popularity would
make the fortune of the breeder who succeeded in rearing them.
But as it is not easy to find a pair of young birds in perfect condition,
it is rather difficult to prove the thesis of the illustrious English
aviculturist.
I have at the moment in my modest collection of Parrots a
specimen of this species which belongs to some Americans who
have given it into my care during their absence. I accepted the
guardianship of this Grey Parrot with enthusiasm, as I wished to
study the characteristics of this bird which I had often seen, though
only fleetingly, without having been able to make a detailed study
of any specimen. The intelligence of this particular bird confirms
what many have written about Grey Parrots in general, for it is
extremely intelligent, pronouncing clearly various English phrases
</bodyText>

and calling the one who feeds him " cookie ". It learned to open
the door of its cage, so that we had to close it with a piece of wire,
which the bird tried to undo and when it failed exclaimed " Oh !
my goodness," with an expression of comical despair. It whistles
and frolics, turns somersaults, and puts the intelligence of my
birds to shame. But it fears hands ; it is afraid of being touched,
which proves that it has experienced maltreatment that it cannot
forget ! As it does not belong to me, I do not care to risk curing
it of this fear. I am afraid that in its fright it may fall (it has its
wings clipped), as if it did it would fall heavily on its breast and
perhaps hurt itself badly. I cannot say, therefore, how far this
bird is teachable, but I do not doubt that the experiment would
be easy in view of its intelligence. I can understand blunting the
wings of a bird, so that it cannot fly far and lose itself, but I cannot
conceive of anybody mutilating a bird in this exaggerated fashion !
At the various exhibitions held throughout the United Kingdom,
where foreign birds of all kinds are exhibited annually in order
to increase the interest of the public in aviculture, it is not
allowed to exhibit birds so mutilated, not so much, I think, on
account of the cruelty involved, but because with their wings cut,
the birds lose their beauty of line and visitors cannot therefore
form a true idea of the harmony of their outlines, etc.
The attachment of the Grey Parrot to its owner has been
described, not only by many naturalists who have studied this
species, but by various bird lovers who have kept specimens of it.
It is a good friend of children, and is in general a cheery companion
who adds to the gaiety of the domestic hearth. There are Grey
Parrots known also for their friendship towards dogs or cats,
with whom they often play with surprising familiarity.
Psittacus erithacus princeps which comes from the Gulf of Guinea,
Prince's Island, and Fernando Po is by some naturalists considered
to be a subspecies of this bird.
In reference to Psittacus erithacus princeps , J. G. Keulemans,
who visited all the habitats of the Grey Parrot, says that Prince's
Island is the paradise of this bird, which is found there in great
numbers. He noted to his surprise that in the neighbouring island
of St. Thomas only very few Grey Parrots were to be found,
perhaps on account of the greater number of Kites ( Milv &amp;apos;us parasiticus)
inveterate enemies of the Grey Parrot. He observed that whenever

one of these birds flew from the island of St. Thomas to Prince's
Island, all the Grey Parrots gave furious chase to kill it or drive
it away. During the day these Parrots fly in groups watchful
and suspicious. Keulemans says that they are more wary than
the natives and more nimble than the monkeys. He also states
that towards sunset each evening they fly to a dense forest which
surrounds and in part covers the mountain called " Pico de
Papagaio ". This forest is so thick that it is difficult to see the birds
it harbours.
The eggs of the Grey Parrot are very similar to those of the
Woodpigeon (Columbus palumbus ). The young leave the nest when
they are about four weeks old and develop rapidly. With us they
eat sunflower seeds and the grain given to Parrots in general.
They love fruit and some specimens are quite fond of all the foods
eaten by man, but I do not know how many are good for them,
as it is said that rich greasy food not only ruins their health, but
robs their plumage of its sheen. In their native haunts they eat
with great relish fruits such as Laurus persea , Musa paradisea , etc.
An enemy of the Grey Parrot is the diurnal bird of prey Gypohierax
angolensis. Dohrn, who ate the flesh of the Grey Parrot, says it
makes a most excellent roast, which is not surprising, seeing that
the Romans, great gourmets, were enthusiasts in regard to the
flesh of Parrots, with which according to historians they also
made a tasty broth. Natives are very fond of these birds, often
clipping their wings and allowing them to run at liberty round
about their huts ; they snare them or take them from the nest.
Naturally when they find out that Europeans like these birds, they
hunt them mercilessly in order to capture and sell them. This is
one of the reasons why African Parrots are diminishing. Formerly
scarcely a ship arrived at a European port without at least one
specimen. But to-day the Grey Parrot, so common a few years
ago, is a much rarer sight. They have been hunted so mercilessly
by the natives for the market, that the few remaining birds flee
from man and hide themselves in the thickest part of the forests.
Schweinfurth says that some native tribes hunt them not only
for sale, but also for the sake of their tasty flesh.

The Timnea Parrot
Psittacus timneh Br.
Psittacus erithacus timneh Fraser. Very similar to the above-
mentioned bird, but a little darker and smaller. Tail almost maroon
red, the beak is lighter at the base with a black tip. It comes
from Liberia and Sierra Leone ; it is more rarely imported.
Specimens of this species were already to be found in the Zoological
Gardens, London, in 1861. In the past there have been arguments
about this bird among prominent naturalists, some denying that
it is a different species, but to-day we are certain of this, although
it is very similar to the common Grey Parrot.
Another genus of African Parrot is the genus Poicephalus , of
which there are various species ; the best known are the Senegal
Parrot Poicephalus senegalus of which I have a couple, and a male
of this species which has now paired with an Indian Ringed Parrot
(Psittacula torquata). The males are very beautiful birds. They have
a dark grey head, which explains why the Germans call them
Mohrenkopf Papagei. The beak of the Senegal Parrot is black,
as is its tail, the back and part of the neck are beautiful dark green,
breast yellow and orange, feet dark with black claws, and it has
golden yellow feathers under its tail. It has various names, the
commonest being :--
Psittacus senegalus Linn. Lthm. Khl., Psittacus versteri Gff,
Psittacula senegalensis Brn., Poicephalus senegalensis Swn., Pionias
senegalus Fnsch.
This species has been known for many years and there is
scarcely a zoological garden which does not contain it or has not
kept at least a few specimens. As far back as 1445 this Parrot
was mentioned by Aloysius Cada Mosto and it was described by
Brisson in 1760.
It is little larger than a Blackbird, but does not resemble that
bird in shape, being somewhat squat, with a short tail and very
long wings. These birds fly swiftly. My Senegal Parrot which
paired with the Ringed Parrakeet is tame, sits on my shoulder, and
is very intelligent, and I sometimes free it in the garden. The
pair on the other hand are not tame and the male has to be kept
caged ; once he managed to escape and it was not easy to catch
him, but as he had a mate he did not go far and it was possible

finally to catch him in the evening. Up to the present these birds
have not bred, although nests have been placed in the aviary.
Nevertheless I still hope. These birds have very beautiful eyes
ringed with yellow ; the female is less brilliant, but still quite
pretty. The whistle of the Senegal Parrot is peculiar and pleasing.
The Red-bellied Parrot
Poicepholus rufiventris (Rupp.) also named Pionias rufwentris
Fnsch., Hrtl. A native of East Africa. Head, neck, back, and wings
are dark, while the wings are dark maroon shading to grey. In
some places the colour of the feathers takes on a green shade
merging into blue. The undertail feathers are pale green shading
to a yellowish tint, the breast, belly, and underwing portions are
a beautiful orange colour. The beak is black. This bird is not
large, being scarcely 20 cm. in length. The eye is reddish, the beak
dark. Some people call this species of Parrot Abyssinian ; Tavistock
also calls it the Abyssinian Parrot.

head and cheeks. The beak is black and the eyes have a reddish
ring. Some specimens arrived at the Zoological Gardens in London
in 1855. This species also figured in the collection of Chr. Hagen-
beck. Lord Tavistock had a couple and said that the male was
not domesticated and was therefore caged and pecked violently at
all who approached, but the female was sociable and affectionate.

Mr. Whitley in England recently kept a pair. This species is a little
larger and the feet are reddish maroon. As early as 1845 some
specimens were brought to Europe by Major Harris. I do not
think this species had yet appeared in the rich Zoological Gardens
in London, which proves its rarity. It also comes from Abyssinia.

Nevertheless the study of these species is still in its elementary

on head and breast, the tail is long with some bluish green feathers,
it has a pink collar joined under the chin to a semi-circular ring of
almost black feathers. In the sun its green feathers take on a
magnificent golden yellow tinge. The beak of the African species
is less red. I have a pair of Psittacula krameri and have noticed that
in the male the lower part of the beak is black and the upper part
coral red ; the female, on the other hand, has a reddish black
beak. Like the female of the Indian species she has no collar,
but is green all over. My Indian pair tried to breed, but the African
birds have not even tried, but perhaps they are old birds ? My
little Ringed Parrakeet I mentioned as having paired with the
Senegal Parrot is very lively and tame. This species is quite well
known in Europe to-day and there is no zoological garden without
a few specimens. In England it has been possible for years to obtain
yellow specimens of the Indian Ringed Parrakeet and of its larger
relative P. nipalensis, some entirely blue with a white collar, of
a truly remarkable beauty ! Breeders of these varieties must use
the same means as are used for obtaining the various colours in
the Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). Anyone interested in
a good reproduction of the Blue Alexandrine Parrakeet can see
one in the Avicultural Magazine of November, 1926, vol. iv,
No. 11. Mr. Ezra, of Foxwarren Park, Cobham, we were informed
in Foreigner , January, 1935, has succeeded in getting another blue

Wild Plants and Seeds for Birds. An illustrated Dictionary of
the best foods for use in Cage and Aviary. By Richard Morse,
F.L.S., F.R.H.S. Price is. 6 d. net. Published by Cage Birds ,
Dorset House, Stamford Street, London, S.E. i.
It is important at all times, but especially so in war-time, when
imported bird seed is scarce or unobtainable, that those who keep
birds should know the different native plants that produce seeds
suitable for feeding ; and there is little doubt that seed-eating
captive birds would keep in better health generally than they do
if their diet were varied with the seeds that nature supplies so
abundantly in our countryside. Those of us who are gardeners are
always fighting the weeds, many of which are valuable producers
of food for cage and aviary birds, so the aviculturist need not go
far to find a good deal of his bird food. Take, for instance, one of
the commonest weeds of the garden which even grows freely on
the paths if allowed to, the small annual grass, Boa annua. How
gardeners detest it, but what joy a handful of it gives to a cage full
of ornamental Finches.
Not many of us know enough about our wild plants to be able
to judge as to which are useful and which not, but we can all
become wise on this matter by reading a very excellent little book
with the above title by Richard Morse, F.L.S., F.R.H.S., in which
the author gives a very generous list of the plants useful as bird
food. The English names of the plants are given alphabetically
and their properties as food producers fully described. It is of
the utmost value to aviculturists in these difficult times and I
strongly advise all who keep seed-eating birds to obtain a copy.

Dr. J. M. Derscheid
News has been received that Dr. J. M. Derscheid and his family are alive and
well in Belgium. Part of his collection of birds has been saved, but many fine
things, notably most of the rare sea Ducks, have died or been destroyed. The
Lories and Lorikeets are all dead because of lack of the right diet during the
German occupation.

Hand-rearing Foreign Birds
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.963047930232558" page_id="56239233"  page_num="69" year="" vol="">
I expect very few aviculturists would embark upon the somewhat arduous
task of hand-rearing foreign birds (though they might resort to it to save the
life of a rare specimen). They would know also such birds do not breed.
About six years ago I hand-reared a featherless Zebra Finch and also a nest
of Budgerigars when the hen failed in her duties. In the case of the Zebra Finch
I was exasperated with the parents who went to nest three times and each time
forsook their babies. When for the last time I found all dead except one mite
just breathing, I told them " it should live in spite of them ! " He grew into
a nicely tailored Zebra Cock and has been my faithful friend for six years. He
lives in a divided cage with a Budgerigar (one out of the nest hand-reared).
These birds are always together and great friends. The Budgerigar talks to the
Finch and copies all his noises--he is also a bit of a ventriloquist. These birds
are not closely cooped up. They fly about daily, are normal and healthy.
Having derived much pleasure from these tame birds, I often wonder if
others (who are free enough to do so) might make the effort to rear birds in a
similar way. They would raise money for the Red Cross or, if given to sick people,
would delight them. There are many enduring a long convalescence due to the
war who cannot read much. For them to have such birds would provide them
with interest and pleasure.

The Whooping Crane of America
In the February, 1940, issue of the Magazine, Mr. David Seth-Smith, in
writing of the " Early Years of the Avicultural Society ", mentioned a statement
by the late John C. Phillips that the Whooping Crane of America was supposedly
extinct. Within the last two or three years a small band of these magnificent
Cranes has been reported by the Indians who live there as being seen in the
great Everglades swamp of Florida and I talked with a white man down there
who told me of seeing them and described them so closely there can be no doubt
of the species. Unfortunately our Fish and Wild Life Service entirely prohibits
the taking of any of these birds, or the keeping and preservation of them in
captivity, so that very probably this small remaining band in Florida will go
into the pots of the Indians and renegade whites who make the great swamps
their home. If only a pair or two could be obtained and put into the hands of
an experienced aviculturist how much greater chance they would have of being
perpetuated. There is one very old (although strong and healthy) male in a
private collection in America, but I know of no other specimen of this species in
captivity.

Breeding of Long-tailed Grassfinches
Mr. B. C. Thomasset writes :--
You may be interested to hear that a brood of four Long-tailed Grassfinches
left the nest in the open flight of one of my aviaries on 17th November, 1940.
They have all survived and are now in full plumage with yellow beaks.

Our breeding records so far as numbers are concerned was not as good in
1940 as in 1939. The Crimson-wings, Alexandra's, Bourke's, and King's all deserted
their first nests. However, the Queen Alexandra's raised three in their second
brood (we now have a lovely flock of twelve of these dainty birds), the Bourke's
raised three, King's raised six in two broods, Cockatiel raised three, Turquoisines
raised two, Swainson's Lorikeets raised five (from three pairs), and Budgerigars
raised fifteen in whites, yellows, and blues.
Our greatest achievement was the raising of a fine pair of Turquoisines.
Our original pair came from Australia in 1934, but were not tried for breeding
until 1938 when one young one came from the nest but disappeared the same
day. The next season, 1939, seven eggs were laid--none of which hatched, and
during the winter the female died. We procured a new female from California
in the spring of 1940 and we were delighted when we saw that the pair were
occupying the nest-box. Nesting seemed well under way when we missed the
male for two days. On looking in the nest-box we saw him dead in a corner and
the female with two newly hatched young. We were in a quandary. Of course
we removed the dead bird but what to do with the young ? Should we take a
friendly male Bourke's and put with her to help raise the young or take them
away and add to the nest of a newly hatched brood of Bourke's, or let her alone ?
We finally decided to let her worry about her babies and if she did it did not
affect them except that they emerged from the nest fully feathered and strong.
Evidently it was the best thing to do, for the pair are splendid birds. It was not
long before the colour marking easily distinguished the male from the female.

This most attractive bird is found in the Himalayas from Sutlej
to Bhutan from 4,000 to 8,000 feet, and keeps to the greenest and
most humid forests, though it frequents the more open parts of
these. According to Oates it " breeds from May to July, constructing
a deep cup-like nest of moss and fibres which is suspended from
one or two twigs of a branch. The eggs, usually three in number,
are whitish, marked with brown of various shades, and measure
*78 in. by -56 in.".
Describing one nest, Mr. Gammie says: " It was one of the most
artfully concealed that I have ever seen. It was a rather deep cup,
composed of moss and fine root-fibres and thickly lined with the
latter, and was suspended at a height of about 6 feet amongst the
natural moss hanging from a horizontal branch of a small tree,
in which it was entirely enveloped. A more beautiful or more
completely invisible nest it is impossible to conceive. It contained
three fresh eggs." I have kept this beautiful bird in cages as well
as in aviaries and they do wonderfully well, but to see them at
their best they should be kept in aviaries. Their movements are
very pretty and they always look so happy. I have fed them on
any good insectile mixture with a good deal of fruit, which they
love. The Ixulus is very much like the Yuhina, but it has a shorter
and thicker beak and its crest is a heavy one. They are very
good livers and I have had mine in aviaries for quite a long time.
I consider them some of the most attractive birds to be kept in
an aviary.

(Phigys solitarius)
By Robert A. Patten, B.V.Sc., Superintendent and Curator,
Taronga Zoological Park, Sydney, Australia
Could any bird lover be other than thrilled on viewing this
charming Lory ? What a galaxy of colour it presents with its
brilliant plumage of rich crimson, purple, blue, green, and touches
of orange ! Of all the birds found in the islands of the Pacific
surely the Solitary Lorikeet from Fiji must be considered one of
the most beautiful creatures of nature.
Through the kindness of Mr. F. C. Exon, Fiji Radio Service,
we came into possession of a number of these birds in 1938.
Considerable care and attention to detail was necessary to
acclimatize and rear them in Sydney during the first twelve months
after arrival. However, we were fortunate in so far as we suffered
no losses. Eventually the birds were transferred to a roomy aviary
allowing plenty of direct sunlight in the flight, and the retreat
adjoining was well sheltered against the prevailing winds.
The Solitary Lorikeet is found in most of the Islands of Fiji
and is known there under the name of " Kula ". Its natural food
consists principally of nectar and fruit, particularly soft sweet
berries. It nests during the month of September in hollow trees,
the number of eggs usually being three or four, oval and white
in colour.
The birds forwarded to us soon settled down and became
charming exhibits due not only to their brilliant plumage but also
to their friendly habit of climbing on the front panel of netting of
the aviary within a few feet of the admiring public, who were thus
able to view the birds at close quarters.
Late in the 1939 season, we erected a number of breeding
aviaries each having a flight of 25 ft. by 5 ft. by 7 ft. high, and a
pair of Lories was transferred to one of them. I endeavoured to
procure some of the giant bamboo from New Guinea for nesting
purposes but unfortunately without avail, so a hollow log 1 ft. 6 in.
long was hung in the flight.
Early in October it was noticed that the birds were taking an

interest in the nesting log as they frequently were going in and
out of the nest. However it was not until 16th October that one
egg was seen.
On 13th November the birds appeared most disturbed and an
inspection of the nest revealed that the egg was broken with the
young dead inside the shell.
Unfortunately, during the incubation period a number of
picnickers carried out their organized sports near by and I suspect
that this was responsible for upsetting the birds, as from that time
onwards the hen and cock would often be in the log together and
on other occasions the nest would be deserted while both birds
were flying up and down the length of the flight. So nervous did
they become that whenever the keeper entered the aviary, if one
bird happened to be in the log, it would immediately leave it.
Naturally we were disappointed but realized that additional
time was necessary for the birds to accustom themselves to the
new surroundings.
As the 1940 season approached we were anxious that every-
thing possible should be done to induce these Lories to multiply.
The food supplied consisted of the following : a mixture of Mellin's
Food, sweet condensed milk, a few drops of fresh tomato juice,
Marmite (a vegetable extract), and water ; fruit (apple, banana,
pear, pawpaw) ; greens (lettuce and freshly cut lucerne).
On 14th August, 1940, a nesting log 1 ft. 6 in. long with an
inside diameter of 6 in. was hung in the flight but placed under
cover from the rain. On the morning of 2nd September, an egg
was found broken in the pond ; this was a rather depressing start.
However, on 23rd September, one egg was&amp;apos;laid in the log.
After our previous experience we did not think it advisable to
intrude by making another inspection until 2nd October when
we were delighted to find two eggs were present. On 21st October
one young bird emerged from the shell ; unfortunately the other
egg was not fertile.
On 28th October the young bird resembled a ball of white fluff
and on 5th November it was covered with grey coloured down.
Four days later it was noticed that growth was remarkably rapid.
The nest, however, was becoming extremely dirty and foul due
no doubt to the type of food consumed by the parents.
On 12th November it was possible to detect the development

of the pin feathers coloured red and green, and on 18th November
more colour was evident, but the dirty condition of the nest was
now causing us some anxiety. Fearing, however, that our intrusion
might have unfortunate results, we decided to leave well alone and
hope for the best.
On 23rd November the feathers were more vivid in colour ;
the head being covered with dull green feathers. On 2nd December
the breast and sides were the last portions to be clothed.
The bird appeared to be ready to depart from the nest on
gth December, but it was not until the 21st that it actually left
the nesting log and flew into the flight. This was a most remarkable
thing as the length of time from hatching was almost nine weeks.
Both parents assisted in rearing this young bird, but it was very
noticeable that some days only the nectar was partaken of, the fruit
remaining untouched.
In reviewing the breeding of this Lory it was a constant source
of worry and anxiety to find the nesting log in such a filthy and
insanitary condition ; at times the young bird was actually standing
in a liquid slime of excreta which would later become firm again.
The astonishing thing, however, was that throughout the long
period in the nest the young bird remained quite clean and
eventually left it in excellent condition.
The young bird differed from the adults in that the mandibles
were a slate colour (adults yellow with orange at the tip), the feet
grey or putty in colour (adults salmon), the red band on the upper
mantle narrower and duller, and the eye of the young bird
practically black throughout whereas in the adults the iris is yellow
and the cornea brown.
So quiet did these birds become later in the season that it was
not an uncommon sight to behold them drinking the nectar as it
was being poured from the keeper's jug into their food basin.
As an exhibit, the Solitary Lorikeet is a most charming and
attractive bird. It is active, friendly, and very fond of light rain
showers ; during these changes in the weather it is generally to
be seen displaying on the wet netting or hanging to any small
twigs protruding through the enclosure.

Mr. D. Seth-Smith writes :--
The Editor has allowed me to see Mr. Patten's article in proof
and I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating him
on behalf of aviculturists in England upon his great success
with what is generally regarded as a difficult species, though the
climate of Sydney is far more favourable to its welfare than that
of London. This very beautiful species was first brought to England
by Dr. Manson Bahr who succeeded in landing ten examples in
the late autumn of 1911. Most of them were temporarily deposited
in the London Zoological Gardens where one had an opportunity
of studying and admiring them. It is certainly one of the most
beautiful of the brilliant group to which it belongs and on account
of the unique ruff of pointed green and crimson feathers on the
nape we named it the " Ruffed " Lorikeet, a name which seemed
more appropriate than that of " Solitary " Lory given by Latham,
since the species is, by all accounts, anything but solitary. Dr. Bahr
contributed an interesting account of his experiences with these
birds to our Magazine for December, 1911. Very few have been
imported since though there is, or was very recently, a living
specimen in the London Zoo.

Before starting I ought to mention that I have only been out here
three months, added to which I am working all day and every
day with about two hours each evening before dark for recreation,
so many of my observations are necessarily sketchy.
First of all a brief description of the surrounding country
and climate might be useful.
Just here on the coast the country is pretty open, consisting
of coarse grass about knee high, interspersed with large patches
of scrub vegetation about five or six feet high. Except for native-
made paths here and there, this is practically impenetrable,

although one can see right across it when standing at the edge.
There are plenty of palm trees dotted about, and the general
effect is rather park-like. Farther inland the palms become more
frequent, one begins to come across tall cottonwood trees, and
the vegetation generally tends to become higher and more forest-
like.
The climate is divided roughly into the rainy season from
March to June, the " small rains " from July to October, and
the hot dry season from November to February. The temperature
seldom exceeds 85* F. in the shade at any time of year, nor does it
ever drop below 70* F. even at night. When I arrived in August,
the shade temperature was about 75 0 F. at midday. Actually
it feels much hotter owing to the high degree of humidity in the air.
The first bird that I recognized was the Rufous-necked
Weaver and his cousin the Atlas. They nest in colonies in the
trees bordering the native villages, and one's attention is at once
drawn by the well-known fizzling, buzzing song. Looking up one
sees the nests hanging in clusters, sometimes only separated from
each other by about a foot, while the birds themselves seem to be
perpetually quarrelling as they hang upside down from the nests
with half-open wings.
Knowing the ferocious temperament of the Rufous-necked
Weaver in an aviary, it is rather amazing how they ever manage
to hatch and rear young in such close proximity to one another.
Each bird seems to fly from nest to nest only to be driven off by
another one as soon as it alights.
They were evidently breeding in September, as a native showed
me a live nestling at that time.
I rather think these birds are monogamous, as there are always
quite as many cocks as hens at the nests and, when seen out in
the bush, they are generally in pairs.
Although preferring the precincts of human habitations when
nesting and carrying on their affairs quite unconcernedly with all
the bustle of native village life just beneath them, they are very
shy and difficult to approach out in the bush, where they go
presumably to feed.
The next bird to come to my notice was the Yellow Backed
Whydah. The cocks were in colour in August when I arrived,
and still appear to be now in November. He is very noticeable

as he sits on top of some low bush, fluffing up his head feathers
till they look like a ruff. Suddenly, his racket-shaped tail spread to
its fullest extent, he launches off on a display flight. Up, up he
goes in a series of undulations, perhaps twenty or thirty feet in the
air. Then down he comes to perch near his lady love (or loves).
I am not sure whether this species is polygamous or not. Sometimes
one sees one, sometimes several birds out of colour accompanying
a cock. Possibly in the latter case the extra ones are youngsters.
It is impossible to get near enough to see. I have as yet seen no
evidence of their breeding.
Orange Weavers are common. The cocks were in colour in
August, but are now, in November, becoming less and less notice-
able, so I think they must be going into eclipse. They have the
wonderful fiery red that one only sees on freshly imported cocks
in colour, and show up a long way off, looking literally like balls
of fire as they bob from bush to bush, each cock followed by a
stream of about ten birds out of colour. Here again it is impossible
to differentiate between hens and immature birds. As I have seen
no nests, and the birds appear to be going into eclipse, one might
assume that this is the tail end of the breeding season, hence the
large number of supposed hens to each cock.
Pintailed Whydahs are, if anything, commoner than Orange
Weavers. Like the latter, they were in colour in August, but in
November appear to be going out. They have the same habits,
each cock being followed by a small flock of " eclipse " birds.
If this species is parasitic, as it is supposed to be, it is most likely
to choose, at any rate in this district, Orange-cheeked Waxbills,
Bronzewing Mannikins, or Firefinches, as its foster parents, as
these are the only small seed-eaters I have seen locally.
The Orange-cheeked Waxbills frequent the bush in small
parties numbering up to a dozen. All you hear at first is their
familiar cry and then they hop up the long grass stems to have
a look at you, their tails wagging from side to side. Strangely
enough, I have never seen a Red-eared Waxbill here. I say
strangely, because one always associates Red-ears with Orange-
cheeks in one's mind at home.
Bronzewing Mannikins have the same habits as the Orange-
cheeks, but in this case I have sometimes seen flocks of over a
hundred birds. They get up from the long grass just in front of

you, only to settle about fifty yards farther on and repeat the
performance when you come up with them.
These birds were nesting in August and are still doing so,
often choosing to build in holes under the eaves of houses. I have
to-day been watching a pair building just outside the window.
They bring in enormous lengths of dried grass or similar material,
which takes their fancy, and every now and then they stop for a
rest on the telephone wire and the cock entertains his mate with
his quaint little song and dance. Once they were joined on the
wire by a family party of mother, father, and about six mouse-
brown youngsters, but these were soon requested to leave.
Firefinches of a sort are fairly numerous. They are not the
common form, being more of a plum-red than brick-red as in the
common bird. They are also a shade larger and the hen appears
almost as coloured as the cock, perhaps not quite so bright. They
are seen nearly always in pairs, sometimes in very small parties.
They frequent gardens as well as the bush, a thing which I have
never seen the Orange-cheeked Waxbills do.
Although all the foregoing birds keep in parties consisting of
their own species during the day, they appear to amalgamate in
the evenings for roosting purposes. I have seen enormous flocks
at sunset, consisting of Orange Weavers, Pintailed Whydahs,
Orange-cheeked Waxbills, and Bronzewing Mannikins, and a
lovely sight they made, rising in front of one and flying back over
one's head, the long tails of the cock Whydahs silhouetted against
the evening sky.
All the above seed-eating birds appear to feed largely on the
seeds of the different grasses which abound. There is never a
shortage of this food, as when one type of grass finishes there is
always another kind coming on to seed, and by the time that is
over, the first lot is seeding again. Plant life is like that in this
climate. There appears to be no rest period. The old leaves on
the trees are merely pushed off by the new ones growing.
I have a suspicion that this applies to the breeding of the birds
themselves, as some seem to be breeding now and some don't.
After all, there is no appreciable change in temperature or length
of daylight all the year round. Insect life is abundant, and the
food supply is constant, so there is nothing to stimulate them into
breeding condition at any particular time.

Of course there must be a moulting period, but apart from this
I see no reason why they should not breed at any time of year.
The natives tell me that most of the birds start to breed at the
beginning of the rainy season, but they are very unreliable sources
of information as far as natural history is concerned.
A lovely little Sunbird, I think, the Scarlet-chested, is quite
common wherever the red hibiscus flowers. It moves so quickly
one never catches more than a glimpse of it as it flits from blossom
to blossom, clinging to the edges and plunging its beak into the
scarlet depths of each one.
A sight I shall never forget is that of a large hibiscus bush
covered with the gorgeous red flowers and this tiny jewel of a bird
vying with the brilliant butterflies for the nectar.
The only nest that I have so far found out here was, I think,
that of a Sunbird. It was purse-shaped with the entrance near
the top, and suspended from an evergreen branch, so that the
leaves at the end sheltered it. The material seemed to consist
of spiders' webs into which had been woven bits of bark and leaves,
the whole structure being remarkably strong. It contained two
tiny eggs, white with brown dots at the large end.
Grey Parrots must be common a little way inland, as the natives
always have plenty for sale. You can buy one here for as many
shillings as you would pay pounds in England. When you see a
number together it is quite easy to pick out the cocks and hens and*
needless to say, I soon bought a pair.
Contrary to what I used to imagine, all these birds are wild
caught and not hand-reared. Consequently they are very nervous
at first, and at your approach make that awful growling noise
which tame ones make at home only when they are really frightened.
My pair have soon become tame enough to sit on my hand,
but they are still very nervous, and sit like a couple of graven
images when one goes near them.
They are as affectionate with each other as a pair of Budgerigars,
and spend most of their time preening each other's neck feathers
or feeding one another. The hen goes through the usual display
of dropping her wings, making a straining noise, and finally
regurgitating. The cock never does this. He simply regurgitates
when pressed to by the hen. He is altogether the less demonstrative
party. They are devoted to each other and, if separated, are

restless until they get together again. Their funny little gurgle of
greeting as they wring beaks on reunion is quite pathetic.
I have always looked on the African Grey as a nice quiet
Parrot which never shrieks, but these half wild ones have a voice
like that of a Cockatoo, which they use pretty often. I think it is
a sort of warning cry as much as anything, such as they would
use in a wild state when they spotted danger. When they get
tame they forget it.
They are much more alert and quick in their movements than
the ones at home, which look more reptilian than avian, with their
slow methodical actions. This I think is largely due to long caging
as I must say that the ones at Keston in aviaries large enough to
allow them to fly are as active as the ones out here.
The only food obtainable for them here is white maize, pea nuts
(which they will not touch), palm nuts, and sugar cane on which
they seem to thrive. They adore palm nuts which are evidently
one of their principal foods in a wild state.
Palm nuts are a bright fruit about the size of a cherry with a
large kernel, so large in fact that the actual fruit consists of little
more than a thick rind, which is the part the Parrots love. The
kernel is too hard for them to crack.
One of the greatest thrills I have had out here was my first
sight of wild Grey Parrots. A friend and I had motored inland one
evening, and had stopped the car to do a spot of butterfly catching,
when I heard squawks and whistlings high overhead and there,
flying abreast, were unmistakably four Grey Parrots. They had
rather a rapid wing beat and their short bodies and tails made
their wing span appear comparatively wide. They whistled and
squawked to one another as they flew and were soon lost to view
over the tree tops, heading towards the sunset.
A native happened to be passing and, noticing my interest,
asked me if I would like to buy a Parrot, so I went along to his
hut, and there in a yard outside were about two dozen of them
climbing about on branches fixed to the wall. It was from these
that I selected the cock bird which I have at present.
I have written rather at length on Grey Parrots, but so little
seems to be known of the wild life of these well-known birds that
I have always wanted an opportunity of seeing them in their
native home. Now that that opportunity has come so unexpectedly
I intend to make the most of it.

Cleres, as a bird park, is no more. In the November number
of this Magazine, 1939, I expressed the hope that my Normandy
home might be spared the fate of the one I had in Picardy, which
was completely destroyed by the Germans in the last War. That
hope proved vain. All precautions and sacrifices designed to
maintain Cleres at any cost proved useless in the face of
bombings and invasion. Now it is no more than a much-damaged
chateau in an empty and neglected park, itself disfigured with
the pock-marks of bomb craters.
When last I saw it, on 7th June, 1940, some thirty bombs, dropped
a fortnight before, already had marred its appearance in many
places and several hundred birds and mammals had been killed.
I was then ordered away with my army unit and I have not seen
Cleres since. But I know that on the day I left, as well as on those
immediately after, the park suffered greatly from further bombings
as well as machine-gunning from the air. Four people, as well as
many more birds and animals, were killed.
Then came the German troops. There followed looting and the
loss of still more birds and animals. Some of these escaped through
doors left open, while others mixed with different species and were
killed in the ensuing fighting. However, the Germans permitted
three of my men, who had remained near by, to return and care
for what was left of the collection. But naturally in the interim
all the more delicate species, including the Birds of Paradise, the
Humming Birds, Sunbirds, and those of insectivorous habit, had
died of starvation.
Mr. F. Fooks, who for twenty years had taken care of my collection
and managed my estate with the utmost zeal and devotion,
fortunately managed to escape to the free zone of France and, later,
to England. He had wanted to stay on at any price and against
my advice. But on 8th June, having moved some of the rarer
birds to a place of supposed safety farther west, he found he could
not recross the Seine and so was cut off from Cleres.
As it turned out this proved most fortunate, for had he, an
Englishman, fallen into the hands of the advancing Germans he

would have been imprisoned or possibly have met with an even
worse fate. Some days later we met by luck at the home of an old
friend and bird lover, M. A. Decoux, near Limoges in Central
France, whose fine collection of Parrakeets, Doves, and small birds,
I am glad to say, is still intact and so far unmolested.
Here Mr. Fooks and I parted. As I watched him, his French
wife, and his children depart in a car driven by one of my sergeants,
I realized that the last connecting link between me and what had
been my life for many years had been severed. The Fooks family
eventually arrived safely in England after a perilous journey,
while I went to Agen, in South-western France. Here I was
demobilized on 20th July. My small part in the defence of France
was finished.
In August my friends, Dr. A. Urbain, Director of the Paris Zoo,
and M. Fr. Edmond-Blanc, visited Cleres on my behalf. They
reported that possibly a thousand birds, or less than a third of the
original collection, remained. These survivors were badly fed
and constantly disturbed by the German soldiery, and on the
advice of my friends I consented to have the rarest removed to
Paris. Fortunately permission for the transfer was given. Later it
might have been refused for, as I understand, soon it was made
impossible to feed the remaining birds and it became necessary
for them to be disposed of to the firm of Louis Ruhe, of Hanover.
Naturally I was sorry to hear of this, but at least it was better than
to have them die of starvation.
After spending four months following my demobilization in an
idleness which was painful, despite the companionship of my mother,
I was lucky enough to be allowed to go to New York, where the
hearty welcome of my American friends gave me a new taste for life.
I was soon offered the position of Consultant to the New York
Zoological Society. Needless to say I accepted and the great
interest I am taking in the work, as well as in some other of a
scientific nature at the American Museum, no doubt will gradually
lessen my bitterness over everything I have lost in Europe.
The future is in the lap of the gods. It seems impossible to make
any plans at the moment but it would appear that conditions in
France never again will be such as to enable me to resume my usual
occupations there or to restore Cleres to its former state.
With the passing of Cleres went the last great private collection

in Continental Europe. The few remaining in England, I hope,
may survive. But I fear that future conditions there, too, will make
it impossible to maintain them on the same scale as in the past.
This is a pity for in the large parks where such collections were
maintained it was possible to keep many birds and mammals of
certain species to far better advantage than is practicable in public
zoos.
Most of our members have heard of Cleres and quite a number
have visited it. It is not for me to say how fine it was. I shall
only mention that it was situated in a pretty, narrow valley sur-
rounded by picturesque hills. The historical chateau, of late Gothic
period, and the ruin of an eleventh-century castle, of great archi-
tectural value, stood in the middle of a park of several hundred
acres. In the park there were also many paddocks and other
large enclosures, innumerable pens, and pheasantries, tropical
houses, and galleries for the more delicate species, a lake and a
river of clear running water.
The great house at one time contained many works of art, period
furniture, and family heirlooms, as well as one of the finest ornitho-
logical libraries in the world. All these, unfortunately, were
destroyed by fire in February, 1939, but the chateau itself was
saved.
To-day practically nothing remains of what I spent the best
years of my life in creating. Actually, at Cleres only a short time
ago I possessed everything to which as a child I had looked forward
when I dreamed of one day being a naturalist with a great collection
of birds and mammals, as well as of their skins, and with a com-
prehensive library devoted to my favourite subjects. It was a dream
come true and then, at fifty, I suddenly find it vanished in thin
air like a pin-pricked bubble.
It is very much to be doubted that the world will ever again
see another collection the like of that at Cleres. This is particularly
true of the Waterfowl and Pheasants. And it is especially regrettable
in that many extremely rare species, after long and patient effort,
had been so acclimatized and otherwise conditioned that they bred
regularly and successfully.
Aside from such memories as the writing of papers may revive,
or which may result from other causes from time to time, for me
the past is dead. Perhaps my bitter experience may serve as an

Although not following the strict order of precedence as given
in the books, I find it convenient to take the LOVEBIRDS here,
partly because there is a great deal of new matter in their records,
and partly because these will show how much is to be done in the
way of summarizing and generally arranging the mass of records.
This must be done by another, and I hope that when the present
trouble is over some one willing and competent will be forthcoming.
In A.M. 1928, 199 , a list of Lovebirds known to have been bred
up to 1928 was given ; more have been bred since, and those
I know are given here, but I feel sure that other crosses have been
bred, and all sorts of combinations of more than double parentage,
which need clarification and record.

MADAGASCAR LOVEBIRD (No. 393), Agapornis cana. {Gm ).
" Have been frequently bred/ 3 says Neunzig {p. 717). Russ
appears to have been the first breeder and the event was recorded
in Bull . 1880, 680 , and Butler (. AGB . ii, 214) says they were also bred
by Wiener and others about that time. Among British records
are Oates in 1900--four young reared (. A.M . 1901 , 41) and Lovell-
Keays, 1914--two reared {B.N. 1915, 142). Since about that date
they have been imported much less commonly than in the years
when they literally came in in thousands, and I know no recent
success..
Hybrids
MADAGASCAR LOVEBIRD x BUDGERIGAR.
Neunzig says this cross was bred in 1890, and gives the reference
Die. Gef. Welt. 1890 , 229.
ABYSSINIAN LOVEBIRD (No. 394), A. taranta {Stanley).
Neunzig {p. 715) writes, " In 1906 some were imported by an
Italian dealer and came into the possession of an Austrian avi-
culturist. They bred . . ., two young were hatched, which were
fully coloured at ten months old ; in another brood three young
were hatched."
In 1925 and 1926 quite a number were imported, and there
were more breeding successes. The two first British records
were W. Lewis, who reared one young bird that year and gained
the A. S. Medal {A.M. 1929, 292 ; 1926 , 71, 116), and Groves who
also reared a single bird in the same year. According to Prestwich
writing in A.M. 1928 , 299, Groves's was really the first British
success, as Lewis's occurred a few weeks later. The really first
success since the original Austrian one appears * to have been
obtained in Germany in 1925, earlier than either of the two British
breedings (see A.M. 1926 , 146, and Die Gef. Welt. 1926, 192y).
In UOiseau , 1922, 261 , Decoux gives the name of the first Austrian
breeder as Rambausek.
Shore Baily bred them in 1926, and in that and following years
they were bred by a few other aviculturists, both here and abroad,
but never to the extent and frequency which has attended efforts
with other Lovebirds.

Russ says they were first bred by Brehm and later at the old
Berlin Aquarium (see Russ, vol. i, and Bull. 1879, p. 94). According
to Neunzig (p. 775), Russ used Budgerigars to hatch out the young
and generally met with success, finding them easy to breed. Early
British records are Gooksedge, 1899, " eight young bred " ( A.M .
v. 190 ) ; the Zoo, 1909, and Lovell-Keays, 1914, " five reared,"
(B.JV. 1919, 142). Later they were bred by many, sometimes
almost as freely as Budgerigars ; with Whitley they simply teem ;
his first success was in 1928 (but never reported), and by about
1932 I saw his flocks of true-bred birds and almost larger ones of
various hybrids. He also obtained a few colour-sports among the
true-bred birds ; one which I saw about 1933 had almost the whole
head and chest pink. Seth-Smith in A.M. 1994 , 90, mentions
a most prolific pair which Whitley had--they had reared 24 young
in fourteen months.
In America they were first bred at the New York Zoo about
1926 or 1927, and are now freely bred everywhere where they are

ones once flying on 31st January. Other British records of that
time were Temple, 1909, and Lovell-Keays, 1914 ( A.M. 1910,
103 ; B.N. 1913 , 142 ) . They were also bred in America and else-
where, and then the home-bred stock appears to have died out
and no more Black-cheeks were seen till Chapman imported a lot
in 1926 ; this was followed by other importations up to the Parrot
ban in 1933 ; records of breeding again appeared, among which
Whitley's results were the most striking, though never recorded
by him.
Hybrids
BLACK-CHEEKED x PEACH-FACED LOVEBIRD.
Two pairs of this cross were exhibited at the C. P. Show,
February, 1925 ; on these Seth-Smith writes in A.M. 1923, 1907 ,
" Second and third prizes were awarded to Mr. Sumner Mariner
for pairs of Black-cheeked and Peach-faced Lovebird hybrids,
resembling small Peach-faces with dirty faces." These must have
been the first of this cross to be bred in the U.K., and I think that
Mariner was the breeder as well as the exhibitor, but am not
certain of this. I saw two such hybrids (? Mariner's) at the Zoo
in the summer of 1925, and since then Whitley has bred a number ;
the cross has also been bred in France [A.M. 1929 , 79), and other
countries.
BLACK-CHEEKED x MASKED LOVEBIRD.
First breeder H. Moore of Tadworth in 1928, who was awarded
the French Medal for a first in Europe (see A.M. 1929 , 21) ; this
in A.M. 1933, 48, was by a slip credited to " Lowe ", and for the
correction I am indebted to Mr. Tadworth's advertisement in
Cage Birds , 7th July , 1933, and to a letter from him giving particulars.
The cross has often been bred since, and the hybrids are often fertile,
for Whitley in 1930 and later obtained further crosses, viz. BLACK-
CHEEKED xNYASA BLACK-CHEEK hybrid (five young reared
in 1930 and others in following years), and BLACK-CHEEK
X MASKED hybrid x pure-bred MASKED, this further hybrid
looking exactly like a large-sized MASKED. Further hybrids still
were bred promiscuously at Paignton, but exact results I never
obtained ; masses of hybrids all much alike was the general
impression I got.

BLACK-CHEEKED x NY AS A LOVEBIRD.
Bred by Bennett in Australia in 1927 (A.M. ig28, 301) ; this
was probably the first success, but since then the cross has been
commonly bred, notably by Whitley, who has also obtained further
crosses, as the hybrids are fertile, which he thinks is the case with
most (if not all) Lovebird crosses. He finds the young hybrids
keep closely to type, but occasionally he gets a " sport "--for
instance in 1933 he bred a bird, which I saw, and which when
adult showed no black on the head, the whole of which was a
yellowish brown, instead of the normal black. Further crosses
on record are the above hybrid x pure-bred BLACK-CHEEK
(i.e. 3/4 BLACK-CHEEK) bred by Bennett in Australia, and the
same cross vice versa (i.e. 3/4 NYASA) also from the same breeder.
In the first case one was reared which was very like a pure BLACK-
CHEEK, and in the second one young one only also reared.
Whitley has also bred both these crosses freely, and I expect others,
but with his usual non-publication of the facts. What a pity !
The cross with the male NYASA LOVEBIRD is also on record.

MASKED LOVEBIRD, A personata , Rchw.
First arrival in Europe, 1925, and first bred by Tavistock in
1927 ; two young were reared and two more were reared the next
year (A.M. 1328, 18 ; VOiseau , 1328,33) ; since then they have been
freely bred elsewhere.
About 1928 the Zoo purchased and imported blue male, which
though rather a cripple, mated with a normally coloured hen and
produced a brood of green young ; the next year he was mated
with one of his daughters (green) and more young resulted, all
green. In 1931 he was mated with the same (or one of his other
daughters), and several pairs from others of his green, but blue-bred
offspring also bred ; from him and them three blue young and
many blue-bred young resulted ; see Seth-Smith, A.M. 1331, 233,
and later. I do not think that the first Zoo-bred blue birds did
much in the way of breeding, but more blues were bred in 1933
from the blue-breds, and though most of the blues were thrown

out of the nest by their parents and had to be hand-reared, so that
they were for a long time feeble and badly feathered, many of them
lived and bred as well as their green blue-bred brothers and sisters,
so that the Zoo next year had a stock of strong blue-breds and a
certain number of blues. A good many of the blue-breds were
sent to likely breeders ; Whitley had some and he by 1938 was
breeding them well. By 1939 Rudkin in California had 16 blue
Masked Lovebirds and by the next year he had what he felt sure
was an established strain ( teste Rudkin &amp; Bonestell in letters to me
and articles in Aviculture , which want looking up).
What happened later to this blue Masked Lovebird strain
established both in England and America, is for another hand to
describe. Whitley's collection, I know, was much diminished with
the war, and what happened to these blues I do not know.

Tavistock's in 1927 (A.M. ig28, 55, and VOiseau , igs8 i gg, 61,

months earlier, but as usual published no record ; I saw the young
myself and am sure of the date. They continued to breed with

RED-FACED LOVEBIRD, A. fiullaria (L).
Up to 1926 it was always considered that this Lovebird had
never been bred in captivity, and even now I myself cannot feel
quite satisfied with the records. The first notice of breeding came
to me in a letter from A. Hampe of Berlin, dated 8th December,
1933, in which he wrote :--
" A. pullaria . . . has been bred with full success in Germany, but
I have forgotten by whom ... I think I read the record in Vogel
ferner Lander , but I cannot find it." (Note the writer's " I think ".)
This started a series of communications between us, and he was,
I think, hoping to produce another Records of Birds Bred, with
the assistance of a brother, Helmut Hampe, but the war came
which lessened the chances of this, and shortly after his death
occurred.
As all my recent information comes from the Hampes, I will
give their letters and leave it for someone else to digest the contents
and come to a real decision.
In a letter dated 2 6th February , igg6, Hampe says that it was a
Dr. Frenzel of Freiburg who bred these Lovebirds in 1882 and
described the event in D. Gef. Welt., 2jth July , 1882, where he says
one young one flew which was " inspected by two friends ; a
most unexpected success." He then goes on to quote from Neunzig
(p. 7/5), saying that he describes the clutch, incubation period,
juvenile plumage, etc., but does not mention any complete success ;
he also says that from Russ's long account that he himself never
had a success nor know of one, adding certainly Neunzig would
have entered it in his account if he had known one His letter
ends with a note that according to Helmut Hampe, this Lovebird
was bred more recently in Germany by E. Spille with full success,
" two broods, each of two young flew."
The next information I received on this subject was from

Helmut Hampe who sent me, October, igj6, a reprint from his
article in Vogel Ferner Lander of 1934.
The following is a translation of what he says on the breeding
{p. 15 of the reprint) :--
" The breeding of the RED-FACED LOVEBIRD {Orange-
kopchen, A. pullaria), has only been successfully achieved by E. Spille
{Vogf Lander, ig2g). In 1900 a pair which had been in captivity
some time reared two young, which the parents fed till 8 or 1 o days
after they left the nest, but then started to persecute them, so that
they had to be separated. Six weeks later the old pair began to
collect nest-stuff again, laid three eggs from which two young were
hatched, which left the nest from the 30th to the 32nd day. With
each brood there was one clear egg. The two millets, oats,
groundsel, biscuit, and fresh ant-eggs formed the main food."
The above seems straightforward enough, but on 1 st September,
1939, I received a post-card from Berlin from a " H. Boss " (? Voss)
merely saying that E. Spille was mistaken, his birds were PEACH-
FACED LOVEBIRDS ( roseicollis ) not pullaria. I do not know who
Boss is, but I feel sure he must have been a friend of the Hampes
and that they had told him of my interest in the matter ; I have
heard no more about it. Of course errors in identification are
easy and have before been the cause of erroneous records of
breeding, and so there the matter stands. The Spille success on
the face of it looks good, but if the birds* were not pullaria but
roseicollis, its value goes, also as Hampe in this article makes no
mention of the earlier Frenzel record he wrote to me about, that
also must go to the doubtful ones. The rest of the article dealt
with other attempts at breeding, continuing " in 1868 Dr. Neubert
got as far as small young which died young, and the same happened
with Dr. Russ and a few others who got as far as eggs which were
brooded for longer or shorter periods ... In D. Gef. Welt. i8go,
Russ says that Frau M. saw her hen put twigs under her rump-
feathers for transport to nest ". The article concludes with his
own experience ; mating, collection of nest-stuff, but never an
egg. The same thing happened with six I once brought home
from W. Africa.
The carrying of twigs under the rump-feathers may perhaps
go to support the belief that the birds were PEACH-FACED

LOVEBIRDS, for they certainly do this ; I have seen a tame hen
of this species in S. Africa which did it regularly. Another point
which strikes me about the Spille record is that the breeding took
place in 1900 but was not recorded anywhere till 1929. This of
course may mean much or little, however.

By A. H. Scott
(Continued from p. 57 )
In the case of their young, as in many other ways, Sparrows
show an intelligent devotion surpassing that of any other small
bird of which I have any knowledge. I was much surprised to
find that when danger appears, they frequently endeavour to
carry off their fledgelings to a safer spot. Yet one might have
guessed that this must be the case, for we have all noticed the
numerous corpses of naked young Sparrows lying in odd places.
We have been in the habit of saying that these young birds have
fallen from a nest, though a moment's reflection should have
sufficed to show us that no unfledged bird could fall from such
a very deep structure reached through a small hole, usually near
the top. If the facts have not been reported before I can only
suppose that this transport takes place, as a rule, only when the
coast is clear. The only other small bird which I have known
to show any tendency to act in this way is the Thrush. On one
occasion a Thrush, in an aviary, transported its eggs from a nest
near the door, where it was disturbed, to an old nest situated in
a quiet corner at the other end, a distance of some 17 feet. I have
also known a Thrush, under the influence of fear, to attack and
kill its young. This I did not see myself, but my gardener-birdman,
who was reliable, saw the occurrence, though he asserted, mistakenly
perhaps, that it was the cock which did the deed. I have strong
reasons, short of actual proof, for believing that Thrushes in my
aviaries have killed their young, after disturbances, on several

occasions. Small mammals, of course, frequently kill their new-born
young and also frequently transport them considerable distances.
Sitting by an inland creek, at the time when a record high tide
was flooding the land, I once watched a gallant little " grass-
mouse 55 carrying its new-born young, one by one, up a very steep
bank, which severely taxed its short little legs. Fifty yards away
was a Pheasant, sitting on eggs, and staring in apparent torpor,
at the water which was then advancing to within a few inches of
its nest. Obeying the summons of my luncheon bell (a lamentable
error) I went away, and found on my return later that the Pheasant
and her eggs were gone. But whether she took them is doubtful.
She certainly looked stupidly indifferent while I was watching her :
on the other hand trespassers were very rare, though rats abounded.
The high tide had wetted her nest, but no more.
I found that Sparrows do transport their young as soon as I
began to use rings, and as the facts were surprising, a careful account
was written down at the time (June, 1934). This record was sent
to Cage Birds not long afterwards, but may perhaps be reproduced
here, as only notes written at the time of any occurrence are of
value. I have since then made further experiments and hope to
make others, but the breeding season brings so many preoccupations
that I can never achieve half the things I have long wanted to do.
June, 1934.--" In one of my aviaries there was a Sparrow's
nest in an ordinary Budgerigar box. I went to this nest when the
young Sparrows were a week old, to put rings on them, but found
that they were too young, and the rings did not seem likely to
stay on. The next day I went to see whether the rings had remained
in place, and was astonished to find only one young Sparrow instead
of four.
" I had also visited the previous day another Sparrow's nest in
another Budgerigar box, situated 24 feet away and also about
9 feet from the ground. To my surprise I found in this nest not
two young Sparrows, but four, and half-way between the two
nests, on the ground, a dead one.
" I have never heard of Sparrows, or any small birds, carrying
away their young. Moreover, it appears almost impossible for
a single bird to have carried the large burden that one of these
young Sparrows would be, and to have thrust it through a small
aperture.

"It seems as if both parents must have co-operated to carry
them across. The whole affair is extremely mysterious, as one
cannot imagine that another Sparrow would allow a strange bird
to import young ones into her nest. But no one except myself
and the gardener have access to the aviary, and no other explanation
appears to cover the facts."
A copy of a letter to a friend written at the time gives an
account of the sequel to this incident.
" I wrote you before that one pair of my Sparrows appeared
to have transported their young ones to another box. I found this
almost impossible to believe, as I had not seen it with my own
eyes, but I can now tell you this is undoubtedly what occurred,
as the same thing happened over again, this time under my
observation.
" The same pair had another brood, and at a week old I put
on rings. I was sitting in my aviary reading a paper a few minutes
afterwards when I heard a splash at my elbow. On looking round
I saw an unfortunate young Sparrow in the pond, and the mother
looking down at it from a branch above. The bird was a big
youngster, and it was astonishing that the hen had managed
to carry it right across the aviary. It had fallen only a few feet
short of the box at which she was aiming. On the previous occasion
she transported them into an occupied box, and the young ones
were taken over by the Sparrow that lived there, which makes
the incident doubly extraordinary. On the second occasion she
was trying to take them to an empty box." [This box was just
above my head where I was sitting and my presence very probably
made her hesitate and let her heavy burden fall.]
" I rescued the Sparrow, held it in my hand, and wondered
what would happen next. The hen returned to her young ones,
and very quickly appeared with another one, which she was
holding by the wing. She flew less far this time, although it was
a smaller youngster, and seemed to drop it almost deliberately.
I did not leave my chair, as I wanted to see whether she would
take it up from the ground and try again, but she returned to the
next and fished out the third, which she dropped near the second
one. I watched closely to see if she would lift them up from the
ground, but she did not appear to do so. She kept going down
to them, and stayed some time. The grass was rather long, and

them for awhile and fed them, which is curious, and then
carried them all out once more. She seemed to aim at the other
box at the far end of the aviary and went in there while all three
were on the ground, and carried food from the nest to this other
box. So her intention was clear.
" I then tried picking up the young Sparrows and putting them
in the box to which she wished to go. I think my right course
would have been to have left them there, and sooner or later she
would have found them. Unfortunately, as she did not go into
the box again during the half hour I watched, I was afraid the
young ones would get cold, and I put them back into her own
nest once more. This time she started to feed them, and at the
end of an hour was still doing so.
" I then thought things would be all right, and went off to my
supper, as I had been struggling with this tiresome situation ever
since midday and had had my lunch brought to me in the aviary
in order not to miss what was occurring. I was greatly disappointed
after supper to find the nest again empty and dusk coming on.
After a very troublesome search I finally found the three Sparrows
in the grass, and as a last expedient I decided to put them into
nests of wild Sparrows, hoping that as it was getting dark they
might be adopted without being seen. I placed one in one nest,
and two in another.
" Next morning I found that the two (now dead, of course)
must have been immediately thrust out, as their crops still contained
the undigested bread and milk which I had put in to give them
a good start. As far as I know the third one has been adopted
by the wild mother.
" My usual experience with wild Sparrows is that they
distinguish their own eggs and young quite well, and thrust
strangers out of the nest."
I noticed a significant detail. The Sparrow when carrying her
young held them always at the same place--the top of the wing

near the junction with the body, which points to an inherited
instinct. For the next year, 1935, I find the following note :--
" I have five pairs of Sparrows. When I looked into the nest
of the first two lots, both mothers carried off their young ones,
just as happened last year, and I lost them. So evidently that
event was not so exceptional as I thought it. I had barely peeped
into the nest, so was not anticipating that they would do this,
and was not on the watch. I found the young ones dead on the
ground at the other end of the aviary, 24 feet away, beneath an
empty nest-box. 55
After these occurrences I avoided disturbing my Sparrows, for
they are all albinos, or cinnamons, or carry the factors for these
and other abnormal colours, and losses may be a serious misfortune.
Moreover it was now sufficiently certain that captive Sparrows do
act in this manner. It remained to be proved that wild birds have
the same habits, of which I felt fairly sure, and only carried out
one experiment to confirm my expectation. There were three wild
Sparrows 5 nests in three boxes nailed to a shed at a height of about
12 feet, two containing a couple of newly hatched young ones,
and the third three still naked but large.
One afternoon I disturbed all three by removing and replacing
the young, and ruffling their nests. I then kept watch from a
distance for half an hour, but nothing happened, and an hour or
two later there was still nothing to observe. In the morning,
however, I found the three large naked ones dead on the ground
together at a distance of 9 feet from the nest, and on the wings at
the " armpit 55 was the faint red mark made by the mother's
beak. She had evidently waited until dusk to make her move in
secrecy. The newly hatched ones remained in their nests, and it
is curious that it is not the youngest they seem disposed to carry
away. Twenty feet or so beyond the point at which these young
birds were dropped was an empty box nailed to a garage, and it
is just possible that she intended to reach it. I hope some time to
repeat this experiment, with several empty boxes placed only a
short distance from the nests to be disturbed.
The Sparrow, owing to its exceptional intelligence, seems to be
evolving from the lowest stage (desertion) perhaps from a middle
stage of killing, to a higher stage of active preservation. The

hysterical killing of young creatures in danger must be allied to
the instinct of saving ; but as there are doubtless learned medical
books on this subject, it may be left to the doctors.
The intelligence of the Sparrows has evidently been developed
through its association with man, and the influence of man on the
lower animals would make a subject for an interesting book, if
indeed no such book exists. Animals that have all their wants
supplied, but enjoy no companionship, deteriorate, till the wretched
cow has no longer sufficient brains to get out of the way of a car,
even when it is pushed by the bumpers. The dog, which enjoys
our companionship, has not only developed a high intelligence,
but even a rudimentary soul and knowledge of right and wrong.
The rat from constant persecution, and progressive elimination
of those which cannot detect a trap or smell poison, has become
more cunning than the wisest serpent, but the Sparrow has special
advantages. Petted by many in towns, but slaughtered in the
country, he has learned to distinguish clearly between silver-haired
old ladies or young children with paper bags and horrid little
boys with catapults or unshaven men in gaiters. All this is a
continual exercise of his intelligence, and as the centuries go by
he may, in spite of his small size, surpass the sagacity of the Grow
family, and acquire some degree of sympathy with man.
There is another Sparrow problem, which I have endeavoured
to understand, and that is their curious habit of rushing suddenly
into violent and noisy scrimmages. The Handbook writer
mentions this custom and wonders what it means, suggesting that
it may have something to do with the selection of mates. This
cannot be the case, if only because these wild affrays, far from
being usual only in spring, are still in full swing in the autumn.
When we observe a crowd of chattering and struggling Sparrows
in a hedge we cannot follow the actions of the various individuals,
but in one aviary where I spend much time the birds were of very
various colours, and I could clearly observe their behaviour.
Moreover, not merely often but invariably my entry was the signal
for one of these violent demonstrations, as if fear or any sort of
stimulus sufficed to produce in this excitable bird a kind of hysteria.
I noticed that each day the same individuals were usually the
targets of the same attacker, sometimes pairs of contestants, some-
times two or three to one. They might be the same or of opposite

sexes. The attack consisted of sundry peckings together with much
pulling and tweaking of the wing or tail feathers. No damage,
however, was done, though Sparrows under the influence of
passion can kill and mutilate like savages. At first I thought their
actions were dictated by dislikes, and any of my readers who
happen to be monks, sea captains, or even school-masters, will
have observed how in small closed communities even very worthy
folk are apt to develop mutually hostile feelings for no particular
reason. In a confined space men cannot for long contemplate
with equanimity each other's homely features. These Sparrows,
I thought, also get tired of seeing daily the same too familiar faces,
and acquire a bete-noire or pet aversion. But this explanation did
not seem to cover all the facts, the instantaneous action of every
individual at the same moment, and the absence of any injuries.
One day last summer I came to a different conclusion. Leaning
over a bridge I was watching some foreign ducks sailing quietly
on the water below, while overhead a band of Swifts where whirling
and screaming in the sky. Suddenly the ducks, and all at the same
instant, began, as ducks will, to splash and quack, rushing madly
around in every direction : and some of them at least appeared
to make sham attacks upon others. This, I thought, was very
like the hullabaloo of the Sparrows, and looking up at the Swifts
I thought that they too in the excited din of their Dionysian
revelries were moved by some similar impulse. It is natural no
doubt for most gregarious creatures to seek by loud and ugly
noises and violent motions, a more intense consciousness of life.
A flock of homo sapiens, gyrating enthusiastically to the discords
of Henry Hall, or leaping into the air to the nobler strains of the
bag-pipes, is probably moved by a telepathic stimulus similar to
that which urges the Sparrows to their peculiar frenzies.
The dances of certain savages, we are told, are an imitation of
their daily occupations, one being " a representation of conjugal
quarrels ". This would seem to be a good description of the
Sparrows' behaviour : it is a dizzy dance in the form of a sham
quarrel.
I have, however, dawdled along far enough, and do not suppose
that anybody wants to hear any more facts or fancies about these
despised birds. The subject has perhaps been treated with a levity
unbecoming to our serious journal ; but these are anxious days,

and we must amuse ourselves when we can. I like that Chinese
proverb, invented no doubt by a fellow-aviculturist long ago :
" We cannot prevent the birds of sadness from flying over our
heads, but we can prevent them from building their nests in our
hair."
PS.--As I was about to post the proofs of this article my eye
fell on an essay about birds, by Robert Lynd, in the current number
of a journal which, for the rest, deals with topics far less agreeable.
" Though a man," he writes, " may enjoy looking at any Willow-
wren, this does not mean that he enjoys looking at every Tom, Dick,
and Harry in the nations of the birds. 4 How I hate the sparrows,
the sparrows, the sparrows ! 5 begins one of the poems of Dora
Sigerson ; and many people share her hatred." We all know that
this world is a world of injustice : that Robins should be loved and
Sparrows hated is just one more proof of the fact.

Lest it should be inferred from Mr. Spedan Lewis's article in
the March-April number of the Magazine that the Zoological
Society has never possessed more than one specimen of the Ocellated
Turkey, may I be allowed to quote from a contribution I made
to the Magazine for October, 1937. I wrote : " There is no
doubt that the Ocellated Turkey is better adapted to a warmer
climate than one such as that of the British Isles, but, in spite of
this, examples kept in the London Zoological Gardens have done
fairly well. I have known eight in all during the last twenty-eight
years only one of which died within the year, most of the others
living for three years or over and one for ten years when it met
with an accident."
The nature of the accident referred to I cannot remember (it
occurred some twenty years ago), but I do remember a fine cock

bird being seriously injured by a careless temporary keeper during
the last war. The bird became very savage during the breeding
season, as is usual with the species, and in order to ward off an
attack, the man struck the bird with a pail, blinding it in one eye.
In spite of this, however, it lived for several years.
Illustrating the article referred to (Fifth Series, Vol. II, p. 271)
is a photograph of the cock bird in full display, which Mr. Lewis
seems to have forgotten since he says : "if we can get a photograph
of that [the display] this year the Magazine shall have it."
In this photograph may be seen the hanging wattle which
Mr. Lewis does not appear to have noticed, for he says : " there
is no hanging wattle on the top of the head." It is not " on the
top of the head " but hangs from just above the bill as in
the common Turkey and is only apparent during display, like the
erectile fleshy knob on the forehead which the photograph also
shows. These features are shown more clearly in the close-up
photograph published with this.
I am sorry to learn that of the fine lot of young poults that
Mr. Lewis was kind enough to show me last summer only two have
survived. He has a far better chance of rearing this magnificent
species than has the Zoological Society with its very limited space
and disturbance by visitors. There is no doubt that this tropical
species is very much more sensitive to climatic conditions than its
relatives from more temperate climates, and I think Mr. Lewis
has to thank an exceptionally warm and dry summer for his
success, though this was only partial. Let us hope that he will be
more successful this year, and may I suggest that the Turkey hen
should herself be allowed to hatch and rear some of her chicks
and thus qualify her owner for the Society's Medal.
Of those I have known in the London Zoo only one has been
a hen.

The large Vasa is a very striking and interesting African bird.
It comes from Madagascar, is larger than the Grey Parrot, and its
plumage of a maroon shade is so dark that it appears almost black.
The feathers of the back and tail have a silvery sheen. Beak dark,
feet dark, claws black. Round the eye, also dark, there is a narrow
circle of light skin.
A specimen of this bird lived for fifty-two years in the London
Zoological Gardens. As it never laid an egg, there was some doubt
as to the sex of this specimen, but a post-mortem examination
revealed that it was a female. A magnificent specimen of this
species was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1887 by Mr. Groom.
This bird, which reminds one somewhat of our Grows, was never
popular owing to its absence of colour, but all those who have
kept individuals testify to its intelligence.
The Lesser Vasa Parrot

The French call this species Le petit Vase, but it has other names
too. It comes from Madagascar. It is similar in colour and shape
to the above mentioned, but is smaller. Examples of this species
have often been seen in the Zoological Gardens in London. The
first was exhibited in 1857. Others were on view in 1872 and it
is said that it bred in England. It is rarely seen to-day in the
European markets.

Praslin, Seychelles, is very similar to the two species already

named in honour of Sir Henry Barkly, one time Governor of

it threatens to become extinct. Some examples were exhibited in

Coracopsis sibilans M. Edw. et Oust, is another species from the
Gran Comoro and from the island of Anjuan. It is very similar
to the larger Vasa, but is very much smaller and the plumage
is darker and has no silver sheen. It is very rare and few specimens
have been imported, which renders a study of this race rather
difficult. It is probable that there are other species of Coracopsis
yet unknown.

In Italy all the various species of these birds are commonly called

of the affection displayed by them when pairing. One of the best-

The French call it Perruche a tete grise Bff. The shape of these
birds, which are all more or less of the size of a Sparrow, is that
of a small American Amazon. These dwarf Parrots are, in my
opinion, among the most attractive Psittaciformes, real living
jewels. Agapornis cana , like all the rest of the Agapornis , makes its
nest with small sticks or strips of bark in the hollow of a trunk
of tree or box, and lines it with blades of grass, hay, straw, or
similar material. Agapornis cana is no exception in this matter of
nest-building ; all other Agapornis build their nests in the same
manner. Dr. Russ himself has imported Agapornis cana and has
made a careful study of the species. It has a most beautiful dark
green back, with paler neck and breast. There is a little maroon
towards the tip of the short tail, the wings are long, and there is
some black on the primaries. The beak is light. The male alone
has a very pale grey head and breast. The bright eyes are encircled
by white skin. The feet also are of a light grey colour.
Like the Budgerigar and many other Parrot species, they love
to bathe in wet grass. The Grey-headed Lovebird comes from
Madagascar and other African islands. It is often given the
trinomial : Agapornis cana cana. Brisson was one of the first to
describe it in 1760. Attempts to rear it were apparently first
made in Germany.

there is also some maroon-edged red on the tail which finishes in

This bird was discovered about fifty years ago by Dr. Fischer
and then described by Dr. Reichenow. It comes from the Victoria
Nyanza region. It only appeared on the European market in
1926, but has since aroused much interest among aviculturists,
especially in the United Kingdom. This species has bred freely
in captivity. It is green with a coral-red beak and also a little
red on the forehead. Round the neck and on the breast there are
orange tints. Among the green feathers of the tail several blue
ones are visible. There are also some black feathers among the
primaries. The eye is encircled by white skin as in the case of
many other Agapornis. The beak is paler than in the others. Some
explorers have seen this bird near Lake Tanganyika. Dr. Emin
Pascha, who was assassinated in the Congo in 1892, left some notes
on this dwarf Parrot, which he found in the Ussongo region, where
it was always seen in small groups ; he also mentioned it in the
J.f.O. for 1891.
It is similar to Agapornis liliana in size, but its colouring is less
brilliant and perhaps it is less prolific. In time, it is to be hoped
that this pretty bird may become better known, as it is certain
to find many admirers. The Avicultural Society of South Australia
has presented a medal to Mr. H. G. Packer for the best brood
obtained from this species.

and has produced four hybrids which are very beautiful, although
two of them have since died. The remaining two are extremely
tame, fly about in the room in which I write, and play with the
books, pens, etc. Agapornis Uliana has a beautiful bright green
belly, for the most part flame-coloured head and breast, while
the beak is coral-red ; there is some black on the primaries and
a few maroon-coloured feathers among the green of the short tail.
These birds are shy but very intelligent. My two hybrids are
lighter than the male and darker than the female, but their
colouring forms a harmonious ensemble, the head being a beautiful
reddish maroon colour and the breast yellow merging into light
green. In England a medal was presented in 1927 to Captain Stokes
for the rearing of Agapornis lilana (Nyasa Lovebird). Agapornis
Uliana has been described by Shelley and others, but this name
was first given to it by Keulemans in honour of Miss Lilian Lutley
Sclater. My Agapornis Uliana which mated with a male of Agapornis
personata, nested in an aviary in the garden, where they lived with
some pairs of Budgerigars. The hybrids were transferred to the
house as soon as they were ready to leave the nest. I think the
advice given by some aviculturists never to have more than one
pair of Agapornis in the same aviary is sound, as they frequently
injure and sometimes kill one another after violent battles. I myself
have lost them in this way. An Agapornis was fatally wounded in
the head by a female of the species, probably in jealous defence
of the nest.
The Rosy-faced Lovebird
Agapornis roseicollis (Vieillot).
Psittacula roseicollis Lss.
The Germans call this species Z wer g Papagei mil rosenrotem

it is known as the Rosy-faced or Peach-faced Lovebird. I find
this last name (Peach-faced) very expressive. The forehead of
this species is a rosy-pink to above the eye. The beak is pale rose ;
the white circle round the eye is absent. The back and wings are
dark green, the breast a paler shade of the same colour. Many
blue feathers are visible on the back, under wing-coverts and tail.
It comes from the south-west of Africa.

In 1820 Kuhl in his work Conspectus psittacorum mentions this
species and names it in honour of the famous Professor Swindern
of the University of Groningen. This Parrot was not heard of
again until Mr. Schweizer rediscovered it in 1876 in the interior
of Liberia, where he saw it on fruit-trees in groups of ten or twelve.
Ten specimens were distributed among the various museums of
Europe. Salvadori described them. They are green with lighter
breast. There is a dark ring round the neck, on the back near the
tail and in the tail-feathers themselves there is some dark sky-blue,
and black feathers are visible among those of the wings. The eye
is yellowish. The upper mandible is black, the lower one bluish-
grey.
Zenker's Lovebird
Agapornis zenkeri.
We do not know very much about this species either, but hope
that ornithologists will soon give us more details about it. It comes
from the Belgian Congo and the Gameroons, is very similar to
Agapornis swinderniana from which it is distinguished by its orange
collar and the yellow mixed with a little orange-red of its breast.

Dr. Emin Pascha found this species at Manjenna in the Belgian
Congo. It was described in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society
in 1894. I am convinced that there exist other species or races of
Agapornis , but those already mentioned here will give an idea of
the many species of dwarf Parrots which are to be found on the
African continent and neighbouring islands. Some of the species
are most prolific and interbreed freely, producing very attractive
hybrids.
The Abyssinian Lovebird
Agapornis taranta (Stanley).
Psittacula tarantae Fnsch.
Psittacula taranta Hrsf.
This was described a hundred years ago, but the bird fanciers
of that day do not seem to have troubled about this little Parrot.
It was not until 1909 that Mr. H. D. Astley brought a pair that
had been presented to him from Italy to England ; this pair
provoked the enthusiasm of all that saw it, so much so that they
were described in the Avicultural Magazine. However, it was
only in 1923 that they began to be imported in small numbers
and became popular, especially in the United Kingdom. Mr. Lewis
in 1925 was one of the first to rear them. This bird is green, with
lighter breast and head of a darker maroon shade. There are some
red feathers on the forehead and a circle of red feathers round the
eye. There is some black on the primaries and tail. The feet are
grey with dark claws. Natives call this bird Donkoro. The
Australians have often imported this species, as also others of the
genus Agapornis and have obtained excellent results from them.
The Masked Lovebird
Agapornis personata Reichenow.
This species has a black head, yellow neck and breast, the
latter often inclining to orange, the rest of the body is green with
some sky-blue on the tail merging with the orange. The bright
eye is encircled with white, beak coral. This bird comes from
Tanganyika and Nyasaland. Mr. Pointer introduced several
specimens into the United States in 1925. It also breeds with us,

IIO O. P. STIGAND-AFRICAN PARROTS
and is one of the most robust of the dwarf Parrots. The black
velvet-like cap and the coral beak form a striking and beautiful
contrast. In the Avicultural Magazine (February, 1928, vol. vi,
No. 2) there is a reproduction of a painting by Roland Green of
the blue Agapornis personata , in which the yellow of the common
per sonata is replaced by white and the green by bright blue. This
latter bird merits the attention of all bird lovers, as besides being
curious and interesting, it is undeniably beautiful. I believe that
the first breeders who succeeded in putting on the market a number
of dwarf Parrots of this species would do good business ! Finally,
I do not doubt that the various types of Agapornis will become
extremely popular as they are better known, and that at a not
too distant date they may perhaps rival the Australian Budgerigar
(Melopsittacus undulatus) so well known to-day, new varieties of
which are constantly being produced by clever breeders. In May,
1931, an article was published in England of the steps that could
be taken to obtain other blue personata. In 1932 a blue pair bred
in the Zoological Gardens in London and were exhibited at the
Crystal Palace. Mr. Gross writes from California that he has
succeeded in rearing a blue specimen which he displayed to the
Avicultural Society of America at San Diego.
These are the best-known African Parrots in Europe, but I do
not doubt that many others may be added with which I am not
yet acquainted. In the meantime these notes will suffice to give
an idea of the many and varied forms of Psittaciformes that have
come to us from the African continent.

Wartime Feeding of Cage Birds. Price is. 3 d. post free. Published
by Cage Birds , Dorset House, Stamford Street, London, S.E. 1.
The publishers of Cage Birds are to be congratulated on having
produced, just when most urgently needed, a small book on sub-
stitute diets for captive birds, a subject that is worrying every
aviculturist at the present time when the importation of the usual
foods, which we have all considered as essential, has had to be
stopped.
The matter was urgent and no time has been lost in collecting
a team of specialists all of whom have themselves experimented
with various substitute foods.
Canaries are very thoroughly dealt with by Mr. A. W. Tunesi,
and his advice will be useful, not only in the case of Canaries but
for many of the Finch group. Mr. Cyril H. Rogers deals with
Budgerigars, which are less easy to train to a substitute diet though,
by taking pains and gradually accustoming them to other foods
than the usual seeds, it can be done. Mr. Victor Carr is a great
authority on the keeping of British birds and as these feed in nature
upon the seeds of the countryside there should be little difficulty
in securing them plenty of food if we follow his advice as to how
to do so.
The problem of the feeding of foreign birds is a more difficult
one and is dealt with by Mr. Allen Silver. The smaller seed-eaters
such as Waxbills and Grassfinches present the greatest difficulty
and, in order to induce them to take substitute foods such as meal
in one form or another, Mr. Silver suggests a Canary as a teacher.
But it cannot be denied that without a certain amount of millet or
canary seed their maintenance will be very difficult, which brings
us to the question of the possibility of growing these seeds in this
country, a subject that is dealt with by Mr. R. C. Smith who
maintains that there is no difficulty in doing so.
Every aviculturist should obtain a copy of this useful booklet
which contains a coloured plate illustrating no less than twenty-
five plants all of which provide seeds useful as bird-food.

Failure of Red Rosellas to Rear Young
Mrs. Kewley, of The Old Court House, Whitchurch, Aylesbury, writes :
" I have a very good pair of Golden Mantled Red Rosellas which have bred
the last three years, hatching successfully two, three, and four young. I have
fed them with the usual seeds and crushed biscuits, but every year they fail to
rear all the young hatched. Last year they hatched three. One lived till it was
full grown then died, but they reared the other two. Every year one is found
dead in the nest. How can this be accounted for ? Any hints would be most
gratefully received as to management and where this is wrong.

If I were told that I should be allowed to keep only one species
of Goose I would find the choice easy. First of all it would have
to be a true Goose and not one of the aberrated forms which, though
attractive, still leave me with a preference for the romantic northern
birds which so completely excite the imagination. With the scope
of choice thus narrowed down I should probably hesitate a little
over Ross's Snow Goose and the most impressive Emperor Goose,
but very soon my decision would rest on Branta ruficollis and there
would be no regrets afterwards. For one thing it is the only true
Goose that is really arrestingly coloured--not that that considera-
tion counts for a lot because, after all, it is the character of the
northern Geese which is so admirable. All the same the stencilled
markings give this Goose such marvellous distinction.
It seems to be a human peculiarity, at any rate among
aviculturists, that they like a bird to be either large or small.
In this case the Red-breasted is, for a Goose, extremely small ;
it would be better to call it petite for that would also suggest
daintiness--and that it most certainly has. For this reason this
bird ought to be seen on the land rather than on water. It looks
lovely enough on the water, but see a pair or, better still, a flock
on the land and you will notice that they proceed with a delicate,
mincing gait without a suspicion of a waddle. Indeed, if their top
halves only could be seen in their progress they would, but for
their more sharply inclined angle, have the appearance of swimming,
so smoothly do they walk. They can run, too, surprisingly fast.

The sexes are alike. Only a very close observer could see any
difference between male and female.
In collections of waterfowl the Red-breasted is definitely rare.
Until within recent years it was extremely rare, but Mr. Peter
Scott, who very naturally was an ardent admirer of this lovely
fowl, went to great trouble and managed to get about forty from
Russia. Added to this number is a large flock at Woburn, the
result of remarkable breeding successes from an original two pairs,
I believe. There are two pairs at Walcot which were joined at
the beginning of the war by Mr. Scott's birds. It is a grand sight
to see this lot grazing in the Park ; they are, in fact, the main
feature of the very fine collection of waterfowl to be seen there.
Apart from these birds there are only a very few scattered pairs
in the world's collections.
This species is abundant in the wild state but the supply has
never been properly tapped because of the inaccessibility of their
breeding grounds and because the Russians are so jealous of outside
collectors procuring them. In winter it is met with in large flocks
in the Mugan Steppes and in the Caspian Sea regions. Some find
their way to the plains of Hungary and it has occasionally been
recorded in Britain. The breeding grounds are mainly in the
Yenesei and Obi Rivers area in Northern Siberia, and there is an
unpleasant possibility that the eggs, together with those of other
Geese, are being collected for the sake of their albumin in the
interests of the film and other industries. It seems probable that
in the times of the Pharaohs some numbers of them wintered as
far south as Egypt ; at any rate the Egyptians portrayed it on
the walls of at least one of their tombs. It naturally would be
exactly the right type of bird to satisfy their artistic sensibility.
Unfortunately the Red-breasted Goose is a very shy breeder,
but if we take the original two pairs which bred so well at Woburn
as an example it seems that, in common with other species, once
a pair has decided to breed one can expect them to go on breeding
year after year provided, of course, they be not moved. I under-
stand the Woburn birds were in captivity fifteen years before they
started to breed. Our two pairs at Walcot go through all the
usual preparations for breeding every spring, and just as often
our hopes are raised, but they are maddeningly provocative and
nothing comes of their promises. The fact is they are shy of other

fowl and uneasy in surroundings that do not afford absolute quiet
and peace. It is not altogether true to say that the Walcot birds
have never bred. A few years ago a male Red-breasted paired with
a Ross Snow Goose, and one hybrid was the result---which
ultimately went to the London Zoo. It was an extremely small,
neat little bird which resembled a Ross Snow Goose plus an
extra amount of immature grey. Two years or so afterwards its
plumage had not changed appreciably so that the bird still looked
immature.
In the early days of the Stevens 3 collection, and for years
before we possessed any of these lovely birds, I remember a certain
dossier that reposed in a drawer with other weighty matters. It
was endorsed " Red-breasted Geese 35 and contained much
correspondence and schemes for procuring these birds. There
were many conferences over this dossier, much talking and much
planning, and probably a good many unhatched chickens were
counted ; but I am recording this simply to illustrate the great long-
ing that was felt to possess some of these Geese. When eventually a
pair was procured at great cost the event was celebrated by the
adoption of the Red-breasted Goose as the firm's trade-mark,
which it still is to-day--though dimmed by the calamity of war.
When happier days return it will shine again more brightly than
ever.
Look at the picture which accompanies this article. It is easy
to see that when Mr. Philip Rickman painted it he was thinking of
the lonely Tundra which this bird inhabits, and inwardly hearing
the wild mating call of the male. It is in terms such as these that
one likes to think of the Red-breasted Goose.

With the near approach of the close of a second year of war, the
members of the Avicultural Society in no way show any sign of
diminishing their determination to ensure that the Society shall
survive. The difficulties confronting aviculturists in Great Britain
seem almost insurmountable, but, in spite of all, they are not
daunted, and are encouraged not a little by the expressions of
sympathy and offers of help which have been sent to them from
every quarter of the globe.
The bitterness, the loss, the personal suffering and sadness
are much in evidence at present, but out of it all has come such
a warmth of friendship from fellow aviculturists in the great
British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of
America that this alone is proof that the suffering has not been in
vain and that the future holds great hope and possibilities.
The following letters received by the Hon. Secretary and
Editor show the spirit of comradeship of the aviculturists overseas
and their desire to give practical assistance to their British colleagues.
From Dr. E. B. Woolf, President of the Avicultural Society of
South Africa :--
"For some time, I have been concerned about the destruction
in Great Britain of not only the wild bird life, but also birds housed
in the various zoological gardens and private collections.
" I have therefore approached the Secretary for Agriculture
and Forestry, and have obtained from him # a special permit for
the introduction of all species of wild and caged birds, including
Pheasants and Quail, which are rare and are threatened with
extinction by bombing
" This permit for the introduction of birds has been granted
on the distinct understanding that the birds will be accommodated
in recognized Zoological Gardens and maintained there under
veterinary supervision. As regards Parrots, the permit limits the
introduction to such rare species as have been caged for a period
twelve months prior to shipment. They will also have to be kept
in recognized Zoological Gardens. The permit stipulates that
every bird must be inspected by a competent veterinary surgeon
prior to shipment.

"You will appreciate that this special authority has been
obtained in order to preserve your birds during the war, and there
is no intention that these birds should pass into the permanent
possession of any private individuals.
" I am the newly elected president of the Avicultural Society
of South Africa, and I have interested myself in this matter with a
view to preserving your birds. The members of the South African
Society will do their utmost to assist in the care of these birds when
they arrive and are housed in the appointed institutions.
" Trusting that these arrangements may be helpful in preserving
the collections of those members and such institutions as are being
bombed out of existence."
From Mr. V. C. Hughesdon, Hon. Secretary of the New South
Wales Avicultural and Biological Research Society :--
" At the last meeting of my Society I was requested to write
to you expressing our sympathy with your Society and its individual
members in the dark days and misfortunes through which you are
all passing.
" It must be most difficult to carry on both the Society's
functions and also the establishments and aviaries of the members,
and we congratulate your Society on being able to produce its
excellent Magazine without interruption throughout the past
year, notwithstanding all Mr. Hitler's attempts to the contrary.
" I am also directed to forward you as a small token of our
practical sympathy a donation of #3 sterling towards the expenses
of the Magazine or such other purposes as you may decide.
" Assuring you of our sympathetic interest and support, and
in the hope that better days lie ahead."

WAR-TIME AVICULTURE: A SUGGESTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995094297297297" page_id="56239299"  page_num="119" year="" vol="">
By Prebendary J. E. Sweetnam
It is evident that the difficulties with which all aviculturists
are now contending will tend to increase the longer the war
continues.
Chief amongst these is that of securing adequate supplies of the
right kind of food for the several species, but lack of time, lack of
importation and, especially for those with large collections, lack
of labour, all contribute to discourage the maintenance of any
considerable number of birds.
if, as seems probable, these conditions continue for a consider-
able time to come, there is reason to fear that the breeding stock
of many of those species which have become established here will
die out, and those aviculturists who have either the heart or the
wherewithal to carry on after the war will find it very difficult,
if not impossible, to replenish their stock.
The suggestion this article is written to make is that, before it
is too late, we aviculturists (or at least we members of The Society)
should take steps to preserve at least some species by pooling our
resources, and each agreeing to try and maintain breeding stock
of a limited number of specified species, rather than attempt what
will almost certainly prove to be the impossible task of maintaining
a number of different species under present conditions.
Under these conditions, the care of a small number of birds
should be much easier than of a large and varied collection,
especially where different families and species require different
feeding and treatment, and cannot safely be kept together in such
limited space as would suffice for a few of the same or kindred
species.
Failing even such limited accommodation, there are many birds,
both hard-billed and insectivorous, which could be kept in cages
by those unable to spare the time and labour to maintain even a
small aviary. Such an arrangement would have the additional
advantage of economizing in fuel for aviary-heating, by keeping
the cage(s) in the living-rooms during the winter months.
It would probably be found that (rather than allow birds to
suffer from lack of the care and the feeding which, sooner or later,
many are likely to be deprived of as conditions become even more

difficult) there are many bird-lovers who would be both ready and
able to take charge of a few birds.
What I have in mind is that, through the medium of the
Magazine, our members be asked to state (a) The species of which
they now possess breeding pairs, (b) which of these species they
would try to maintain, (c) whether they would be willing to
take charge of a few birds for other members, and (d) whether
they have any reserve supply of food which they would contribute
to a common pool.
Much could be done in this way through the Magazine alone,
but the successful operation of such a scheme would probably
require the good offices of someone not so immersed in war-work
as most of us are, and willing, in the interests of aviculture, to
undertake the considerable task of acting as liaison officer between
those willing to co-operate in the scheme.
It would be essential to compile a register of those possessing
the several species, so that others would know from whom they
might obtain birds of those species after the war.
It would be for individual members to arrange whether their
birds should be sold, loaned, or given to their new hosts ; but
all such considerations would be secondary to the main object
of securing the survival of breeding pairs of at least some of the
species of foreign birds still in this country.
Though the pooling of food supplies would seem to be almost
as essential as the " pooling " of the birds, it might well present
even greater practical difficulties than, as the writer is well aware,
apply to the application of the whole idea as here outlined. But,
should there be a general agreement that some such scheme is in
the best interests of aviculture, no such problems should prove
incapable of solution.
If adopted at all the idea might be taken up by the members
of other avicultural associations and perhaps, if the suggestion
here outlined commends itself to them, the Editors of other similar
periodicals would take steps to bring it to the notice of their members
with a view to their either co-operating with our members or
operating a similar scheme through the machinery of their own
association.
If anything of the kind is to be attempted it should be put in
hand with as little delay as possible.

J. E. SWEETNAM-WAR-TIME AVICULTURE : A SUGGESTION 121
The suggestion made by Prebendary Sweetnam is one of the
utmost importance, and its urgency cannot be stressed too strongly.
The difficulties of aviculturists have enormously increased during
the last six months, more particularly with regard to feeding-
stuffs, and it is vital for the future of collections in this country that
some system of conserving a representative nucleus of species
should be adopted. In a letter in the November number, 1939,
Mr. A. F. Moody appealed to owners of waterfowl to co-operate
in safeguarding the rarer species of these birds by agreeing that
they should " all not part with or keep the same " and in the December
number of the same year Mr. P. J. Lambert made a similar plea
for the maintenance of a stock of Pheasants. The President,
Mr. Alfred Ezra, also in that December number, appealed to
members to do everything in their power to keep their collections,
and himself contributed to this end to the utmost of his power by
taking birds for those who were no longer able to look after them
themselves, to the extent that his aviaries were " overflowing ".
In this number is the letter offering tangible help from the
President of the Avicultural Society of South Africa, and previous
offers of the same kind have been received from America, notably
from Mr. S. Dillon Ripley (Connecticut) who offered to co-operate
to the fullest extent in any scheme by which birds could be sent
over to America to be cared for " for the duration ". The difficulty
of accepting these welcome offers is that of the transport of the
birds.
At the beginning of the war (as reported in A vie. Mag., Nov.,
1939) a meeting between aviculturists and members of the trade
in bird foods, etc., was organized by Cage Birds to discuss more
particularly the state of stocks of food supplies and the possibility
of breeding mealworms and other live foods. Unfortunately the
attitude taken by the trade at that time has proved far too optimistic.
However, though there has been no building up of large stocks of
seed nor organized breeding of mealworms on a large scale, as was
envisaged by the Editor of the Avicultural Magazine and further
suggested by Dr. Amsler, individual aviculturists have undertaken
mealworm breeding most successfully. Efforts are being made to
grow millet and canary seed in this country, but Mr. Allen Silver,
the well-known expert on bird foods, does not regard these with
much optimism and writes :--

122 J. E. SWEETNAM-WAR-TIME AVICULTURE I A SUGGESTION
44 Millet, I am afraid, cannot be satisfactorily cultivated in
Great Britain and canary seed which once was grown in Kent is
of poor keeping quality. The same applies to English-grown sun-
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.949956482758621" page_id="56239302"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
flower and flax. As things are, no one can use ground for non-
essential crops, and there is both a shortage of labour and land, and
it is questionable whether it would pay. Amateur growing of such
things could only furnish small lots of no interest except to the user.
" Canaries and Budgerigars are all right, as they can thrive
without seed. The former do well on rape, but that is scarce, and
the latter do well on hemp and sunflower, which also is disappearing.
Exotic Seedeaters of many kinds, i.e. Weaving Finches, which will
not eat oil seeds must go when millet disappears entirely, unless
they can be induced to consume meal food. This may be brought
about by caging a hen Canary or two with them. Insectivorous
birds can still be fed, but when all desiccated insectile matter is
exhausted, I can make, I believe, an efficient substitute.
" Apart from Weaving Finches, any surviving birds of other
kinds should be manageable. Groats, oats, etc., are now not
allowed, except for human use or on coupon for certain utility
purposes otherwise. Preserved milk and egg has been withdrawn
from purchase, except for human use, and meals and grain can
only be released on coupon to rationed keepers of utility livestock,
i.e. my miller or merchant could not sell me anything except for
my registered poultry-keeping clients. No cheap millet can be
released if it exists, except for milling."
The three bogeys facing aviculturists--lack of food, lack of
heat, and lack of time to care for the birds, will become very serious
this winter, and it would be a great advantage if someone would
offer, as suggested by Prebendary Sweetnam, to undertake the
large amount of work, needed in acting as liaison officer between
aviculturists. In the meantime the Editor will be glad to receive
the views and suggestions of members on this subject.-- Ed.

I can remember reading a book on domestic ducks in the
foreword of which the writer spoke of them as " our intelligent
friends ".
I thought at the time that the use of this expression was, in
the schoolboy phrase, " pitching it strong," and that almost the
last thing of which you could accuse a Mallard, or any of the
varieties of him, was intelligence.
It is, of course, true that all the Surface-feeding ducks are
singularly acute in the detection of danger, as those who have
spent cold and fruitless hours of a winter's night in trying to shoot
them will be well aware, while the females are, most of them,
extremely clever in the matter of knowing their own eggs, in their
choice of a nesting place and in covering their eggs on leaving
the nest, as those who, in the course of keeping Waterfowl, have
ever trodden on the nest of some rare species, will not hesitate to
agree--and I have heard it said that the keeper of Waterfowl
who has never trodden on a duck's nest cannot, ipso facto , be an
expert because he cannot have had much experience.
But these are matters more of instinct than of intelligence and
the impression one gathers of ducks in general is that, while the
surface-feeding ones are rather stupid, the Diving ducks, like
other creatures which are obliged to hunt for most of their food,
are quite intelligent, though there are, of course, exceptions,
notably among those which are mainly mollusc-eaters. The
so-called Sea-ducks are, of course, divers, and it is, I think, their
remarkable submarine agility and their intelligence, no less than
their beauty, that is their charm.
Of the exceptions perhaps the most noticeable is the Common
Eider (Somateria m. mollissima) which, I believe, will nest readily
in places arranged for them by human beings for the purpose of
robbing the nests of down and, while unaware that their flesh is
far from being in the " bonne bouche " class, will, so I have read,
allow human beings to approach near enough to touch them.
The Scoters are other exceptions, besides being, I consider, among
the ugliest and least kindly disposed of ducks, interesting only in
so far as they are among the most difficult of all to keep.

Until recent years the Sea-ducks were not, so far as I know,
kept with any real success : there were, of course, some instances
of birds thriving for long periods in captivity, but this only happened
where the water on which they were kept was extensive or for
some other reason contained a good deal of live food. It seems
that the main cause of the lack of reasonable success has been the
unintelligent treatment of Sea-ducks : people fed them on corn,
like the Fresh-water ducks, thereby choosing for them an exceedingly
unsuitable diet, for unless abundant live food is available, these
birds will be killed with certainty by corn, though the Eiders and
Golden-eyes will live for a time on it.
Next to a reasonably correct diet there is no doubt that clean
water is essential to success and that, of course, generally means
running water, for if the water is clean though still when the
ducks are put on it, it will, unless it is of exceptional expanse or
depth, very soon be made muddy by their diving and searching
for food on the bottom. If the current is swift, or even only
moderately swift, then some provision should be made to ensure
that the birds are able to sleep on the water in comfort and without
being obliged every now and then to swim upstream when they
have been carried down to the boundary grids. If this is not
done, there is a danger that they will take to sleeping at night
on the banks and so be exposed to attack by vermin.
Naturally they prefer to spend the night on the water and
therefore the best provision for them is a backwater where they
may sleep in peace : alternatively a rocky island or two will
afford them greater security than the banks.
The Surface-feeding ducks are very fond of resting on thick
poles or limbs of trees fixed just above or anchored in the water
and, naturally, these resting places are perfectly safe, for no vermin
can lurk on them, but for some reason the Diving ducks do not
like them, and, as I say, much prefer to stay on the water.
The collection at Sterrebeek was of considerable interest and
especially so because nearly all were reared there.
The summer of 1939 was a particularly satisfactory season :
I cannot recall with accuracy the numbers of eggs put into
incubation, numbers of ducklings hatched and reared, nor the
details of the system of rearing them, and although notes were
made of all this and of the findings of post-mortem examinations,

it is likely that they will remain unpublished for some time or
may even be altogether lost.
Towards the end of June the eggs arrived from Iceland : they
included eggs of Common Eider, Harlequin Duck ( Histrionica
h. histrionica ), Long-tailed Duck ( Clangula hyemalis ), Barrow's
Golden-eye (. Bucephala c. islandica ), Common Scoter ( Melanitta
n. nigra), Goosander ( Mergus m. merganser ), and Red-breasted
Merganser (M. senator).
The eggs were well packed and the boxes were turned each
day on the journey : they travelled well and, considering that
they were fully three weeks on the way, the hatching from them
was good. The worst travellers were the eggs of Common Eider :
it seems that the membrane dividing the albumen from the air-
space is very fragile and a good many of these membranes were
broken.
All the eggs were set under bantams and fowls and the Long-
tailed ducklings were the first to hatch on the twenty-third day.
These ducklings are extremely difficult to manage and, as seems
to be the case with the young of most Sea-ducks, the first trouble
with them is that they are quite willing to start feeding too soon
with the result that the yolk will not be fully absorbed. In 1938
we lost a number from this cause : in some cases they live as long
as two or three weeks and the post-mortem examination of such
as these will reveal a small almost solid ball of unabsorbed yolk,
while in those which die sooner, the yolk is, of course, more liquid.
I believe the explanation is that the yolk of Sea-ducks' eggs is of
a richer and more highly concentrated nature than that of the
other Ducks' eggs--at any rate it seems to be of quite different
consistency--and consequently the young should not be given
food until from 50 to 60 hours after hatching.
From the first the Long-tailed need very clean water, for
otherwise the eyes will develop some inflammation which causes
them to water, making the surrounding down quite wet and
sticky.
We reared all the Sea-ducklings in brooders, being able in this
way to keep them much cleaner than if they were with bantams--
indeed, I doubt if Long-tailed could be reared with bantams.
The brooders were so made that no fumes from the heating lamp
could enter the ducklings' compartment and so that the air in
</bodyText>

<bodyText confidence="0.99889958974359" page_id="56239306"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
this compartment was quite pure and frequently changed, though
without draughts, by the ventilating system, while the temperature
underneath the drum in the centre could be kept as high as required.
The floor of the brooder was covered with a blanket which, of
course, was frequently changed. For the first four or five days
the ducklings were kept in a brooder attached to which was a
wooden run having the floor, some io inches above the ground,
covered by frames of wire gauze and a large dish of water at the
end. This arrangement was for the purpose of training them to
go freely in and out of the brooder which they very quickly learned
to do.
Later they were moved to open pens having near the brooders
deep concrete basins holding about 30 gallons of water and
surrounded by shingle. The water in these basins was changed
daily or every second day according to the number and size of
the ducklings..
These Long-tailed Ducklings were fed for the first few days
on mosquito larvae and fresh ants' eggs, and later on dried flies,
minced bullock's heart, ants' eggs, chopped water-cress (or
alternatively chickweed), a little salt, charcoal, ground cuttle-fish
bone, and cod-liver oil, but we found that they quickly died if
they were given any farinaceous food whatsoever until they were
fully three weeks old, though other species could safely be given
fine biscuit meal mixed with the flies, meat, and so on almost
from the first. Occasionally we also gave some of the small red
water worms--I think they are crustaceans really, being covered
with horny scales--which are very common and were sold in
Brussels for fishing, being, I presume, used as a kind of ground-bait,
for they are too small to be put on hooks. These and the mosquito
larvae, being put into the water, encouraged the ducklings to
dive--a very necessary exercise for them no doubt, for on land
they do not move about much.
The agility of the young Long-tailed Ducks under the water
and the speed at which they could swim were truly remarkable :
on the surface they are, even when adult, rather slow swimmers
and seem to move with difficulty, their little thick-set forms
reminding one of bluff-bowed tugs, but when submerged the
transformation is striking and they can travel long distances with
little effort and at a high speed.

We found that at all ages these birds were extremely susceptible
to aspergillosis : we have lost quite young ones as well as adults
with it and we were always at a loss to know how they could
contract it, for though the spores of the fungus are, of course,
practically everywhere, it seemed unlikely that the concentration
of them in the conditions under which we kept these ducklings
would be sufficient to afflict them so severely.
It was, of course, natural to suppose that the Sea-ducks, never
having had occasion to gain immunity from aspergillosis, would
be much more liable to it than are the Fresh-water ducks, but the
curious thing is that, apart from the Long-tailed, it was uncommon
in all the other species.
In 1938 we reared a small number of the Long-tailed and up
to about six or seven weeks old they were fine sleek birds but
then, after being changed from the young birds 5 food to the duck-
bread (bread made up of wheat flour, barley-meal, meat-meal,
fish-meal, salt and yeast) and the Sea-duck mash (made of the
same ingredients with the exception of the yeast and the addition
of cod-liver oil), they went back and, through not going so much
to the water, their feathers became dry and ragged and their tails
broken off short, so that it seemed a little absurd to speak of them
by their proper name. Most of these were lost through aspergillosis
--it may have been that some of the food was taken by the ducks
to the water and fragments of it dropped to the bottom, there to
become fertile spots of Aspergillus fumigatus if such a fungus can
develop under water.
Similarly the bread, which was always thrown on the water
and which would float for a long time, may, if not entirely cleared
up by the Ducks, have sunk to the bottom and decayed there.
That winter four were killed in one night by a pole-cat which
caught them sleeping on the banks and eventually the remainder
died of disease. One female was reared in 1937 and though it
was never in very good plumage and hated to go on the water,
it lived until the autumn of 1939.
The 1939 ones were altogether better birds, possibly because
of the addition of bullock's heart to their diet. There was less
aspergillosis among them, probably because, from the first, we
gave them a small dose of iodide of potassium in their food each
day.

In the autumn the Long-tailed were sent with almost all the
other Sea-ducks to the estate of a friend of Dr. Derschied where
there was a fine expanse of clear deep water. Here they throve
beyond anything we had previously experienced with the species,
no doubt finding a good deal of live food in addition to the duck-
bread which was their main food.
In 1938 we received only a few eggs of Harlequin Duck : two
hatched on the thirtieth day, but one was weakly and did not
long survive. The other did well on the diet already described
with the addition of some fine biscuit-meal and meat-meal and
grew up to be the brightest and most intelligent duck I had ever
seen, and, at the end of that winter, already nearly in full colour.
Later it was sent by air to the late Sir Phillip Sassoon but though
we packed it with great care and it could have been but seven or
eight hours on the journey it died the next day.
In 1939 a fair number of eggs arrived, a good percentage of
them hatched and most of the ducklings were reared without
difficulty--and a very fine lot they were. These were also taken
to the new place because the water at Sterrebeek was comparatively
shallow and slow flowing, so that so large a number of Sea-ducks
as we had at the end of that summer made it very muddy by their
diving activities. I do not recall a single case of aspergillosis in
these. A large number of Barrow's Golden-eye were reared that
year : these are, of course, one of the easiest to bring up.
The chequered black and white young were rather wild and
nervous for some time, but after about four weeks they gradually
became quite spontaneously tame.
A number of this species had, of course, been reared at Sterrebeek
in previous years and a pair of the 1937 ones nested there in 1939,
but though the female scraped out a nest in the earth inside a
nesting box and we were certain that she laid, we did not find
any of the eggs and evidently they were laid in the water.
In the breeding season the male became very quarrelsome
towards the other ducks, waging against them a clever kind of
submarine warfare, so that we had to take them away and have
the pair to themselves. It will be remembered that a fine plate
of this handsome duck appeared in the first Waterfowl Number.
About ten Common Scoter were hatched in 1939 : the species
had been kept though with poor success in previous years. At first

they did well, but soon after getting their feathers they began to
show the first signs of decline in their dislike of water.
The ducklings were not at all active and spent most of their
time sitting together on the pebbles like a cluster of large drab-
coloured Aphides.
At no age is this species attractive, nor is it, as a rule, anything
but unfriendly towards other ducks, though I have known
individuals to form peculiar attachments to individuals of other
species.
Eventually all of them died and, indeed, from their general
air of melancholy and their funereal appearance, the event was
one for which they seemed to be most suited.
It was much the same with the adult wild-caught ones, which
lose the waterproofing of the feathers within two or three days
after being caught. In this state they naturally dislike the water
and so the feathers tend to become worse.
One female was hatched in 1937 and reared with the female
Long-tailed, to which it was devoted. It lived for about two and
a half years and there were times when its plumage promised to
become fairly good, but, though it was otherwise in good health,
it was never a good specimen and eventually caught a chill and
died through staying out in heavy rain. In 1939 we received a
newly caught pair of Velvet Scoter (Melanitta f fused) : I think
they had been caught only two or three days, but their feathers
had already lost their waterproofing. They were fed at first on
edible mussels, some taken out of the shell and small ones given
as they were, but though Scoters are supposed to feed largely on
mussels, they did not eat many of the whole ones, so may prefer
some more easily digested species of Mytilus. They were also
given duck-bread, cod-liver oil, a little meat and fish. For the
first two days we had to forcibly feed them, but they very quickly
learned to feed themselves. Individuals of the species have, I
believe, been kept with success ; certainly one has thrived and
kept in good plumage at Cleres, but this pair did not at any time
resemble velvet and lived only seven or eight months. The
difficulty with Scoters is, one supposes, due to some deficiency in
the food.
Some eggs of Common Scaup {Ay thy a m. marila) and Tufted
Duck {A. fuligula) were collected by mistake and sent with the

others : those which hatched were easily reared as were the small
number of Common Eider ducklings.
The eggs of Goosander and Red-breasted Merganser hatched
moderately well : the young were very pretty. Some of each
species were reared with a bantam foster-mother, an arrangement
which proved as successful as rearing them in a brooder. They
were fed on strips of fish and bullock's heart : they would also
eat a little of the other ducklings' food and later ate duck-bread
as well as fish and meat. For the first two or three days it was
necessary to offer them the fish and meat by holding it in a pair
of tweezers and dangling it before them : they took it with the
utmost readiness and thereafter they fed themselves and gave no
trouble. The bantam was, of course, taken out of the coop twice
daily and fed on grain outside the aviary. As a variation from the
meat and fish we gave some earth-worms to some of these and
to the Eiders.
Earth-worms were, of course, used with success by several
well-known aviculturists for the rearing of Eiders, but we felt
certain that those we gave were responsible for transmitting
gape-worms to most of the ducklings that received them. We
treated the ducklings with Aniodol, but, because they were so
small at the time, it was very difficult to treat them thoroughly.
We also tried a proprietary powder widely used, I believe, for
poultry, the patient being put into a box and the powder being
blown in. We lost some of the ducklings, but the survivors grew
quickly into fine large birds. Those reared with the bantam did
not have any earth-worms and had no gape-worms either.
In the collection, though not reared at Sterrebeek, were a male
and two female Common Golden-eye (.Bucephala c. clangula). The
male displayed a good deal in the spring of 1939, but they did
not nest. There were also three Smews (Mergus albellus ) which
had been in the collection for about two years : apparently all
three were females.
During the exceptionally severe weather in the winter of
1 938-39 which caused such distress among the Fresh-water ducks
that we had to bring them in, full-winged Tree-ducks were killed
or had their legs frozen, and only the Sea-ducks were happy, the
Smews kept a small area of water open at a place where the
current was strongest.

J. YEALLAND SOME EUROPEAN SEA-DUCKS I 3 1
They frequently dived under the ice, swam about for some
seconds at a considerable distance from the hole and found their
way back to it with a skill that was altogether remarkable.
The other Sea-ducks also kept a small area of water open by
staying on it, but they did not go in for the Smews' winter sport.
Some wild-caught Goosanders and Red-breasted Mergansers,
like the Smews, did well on duck-bread, meat, and fish, though,
curiously enough, they did not like fish and were not attracted
by the live roach in their ponds. A favourite sport of the
Mergansers was jumping into the water from the rocks some five
feet above. The males performed their curious display throughout
the early summer, but no nesting took place.
We sometimes gave freshly-caught shrimps to the Eiders,
Golden-eyes, Scoters, and Harlequins, but it was a pity that they
were not fond of such excellent food.
The young Barrow's Golden-eyes and Harlequins ate duck-
weed with great relish.
One difficulty we had with the duck-bread was that it would
not keep well in hot weather : I have since thought that mixing
in a lot more salt might have prevented its going sour, and it
seems unlikely that a lot of salt would be harmful to Sea-ducks.
To those who have suitable water for them, the Sea-ducks are
deserving of high recommendation : there are, of course, some
handsome and interesting European species and when air travel,
besides other things, becomes normal again, it should be possible
to import eggs of the various beautiful North American species.

By J. G. Laidlay
Geese, more so than Duck, are birds of temperament. It has
been commonly stated that those purchased from abroad take
a long time to settle down and breed in this country. Seemingly
it is not only the change of climate and probable different feeding
that is the deciding factor, but more important to their mentality
is the change in type of vegetation they have been accustomed to
expect for nesting sites. To quote cases in point. At the beginning
of this war we decided to close down those pens that were at some
distance from the house, using only the one that was nearest and
which is the largest and most suitable for waterfowl. In one
enclosure lived two pairs of Blue Snow, one pair of Bean, and a
pair of Cackling Geese. These Geese had always bred and obviously
were happy and contented in the surroundings. They were moved
in October, so should have had ample time before spring to get
accustomed to their new quarters, which not only is much larger
but has more water space ; but not an egg was laid nor even a
scrape made by these birds despite the nesting of the Geese who
had always been in this pen. Geese, apart from all cases of what
one might call exceptional nesting sites, do prefer to nest in con-
ditions as near as they can find to those they would have chosen
in a wild state. The large enclosure I have already mentioned is
of some six acres, approximately half being water and marsh, a
portion wooded with some low bushes and rank herbage, and a
piece kept short by grazing ; at one end the water runs out and is
flanked by a short length of steep bank. Bernicle, being usually
cliff-nesting, choose the bank to nest on, Greylag nesting in the low
bushes, whereas the Blue Snow, being tundra-nesting birds, often
make their nests on the barest of ground, but the Lesser Snow
prefer small islands; in fact all kinds show clearly their individual
preferences for nesting sites. Of course, there are always the
exceptional nesting sites and where birds that are very tame and
much accustomed to seeing people like those kept in Zoological
Gardens or Public Parks can and do nest under strange conditions.
Mr. St. Quin tin's pair of Pink-footed nested in a flower border
close to the house : were they attempting to get as near to their

own rocky nesting site by the proximity of the house ? Geese do
not, as is usually said, pair for life. Sometimes for reasons unknown
they agree to separate, as in the case of a pair of Canada who,
though they had brought up young and were most obviously
paired, one year separated, the male bird pairing with one of his
daughters and the old female with her son. Canada seems a Goose
that has lost some of its proper instincts, for I knew a case where
a male Canada arrived one day on a farm and commenced grazing
along with a flock of sheep, eventually singling out one ewe for
his particular attention whom he remained with for two years,
until killed by accident. When spring came and lambs were born
he would fuss round them as if they had been goslings. Further
the ugliest hybrid I ever saw was between a Canada and an
Australian Black Swan. Possibly a more extraordinary case still
was that of an Egyptian Gander, not of course a true member of
the Geese, who, reared in the Edinburgh Zoological Park and left
full-winged, flew into the sea-lion enclosure and made firm friends
with a sea-lion, this friendship being unbroken for many years.
Occasionally one Gander will pair with two Geese. We had such
here when one Bernicle Gander, pairing with two Geese, who
made their nests closely together laying usually four eggs each,
all proving fertile, and the Gander remaining on guard equally
between the sitting birds during their twenty-five days of incubation.
Another Gander, a Greylag, who has remained paired to two
Geese for several years, shares his affection equally between the
Geese until the first egg is laid, then he drives off one Goose, pre-
sumably the one that has not yet laid, and will have nothing to
do with the second Goose until either the young are hatched or
the eggs taken, whereupon the second bird is allowed to return
and is fussed over as before. I have never heard yet of any Gander
taking three Geese and producing fertile eggs. Some years ago
the Duchess of Bedford wrote to me saying that her four Red-
breasted Geese had proved themselves to be three females and
one male and did I think it possible to expect fertile eggs from all
three Geese. I thought not, and if I remember rightly each of
the three Geese laid four eggs but the clutch of the third bird
were all clear. The habit of the male birds to remain sitting by or
close to the incubating Goose throughout the entire period of
incubation has been here unbroken by Bernicle, Lesser Snow,

and Cackling, usually by Blue Snow and Greylag, though the
latter does occasionally leave the female to search for food. I say
usually by Blue Snow, for we had an exception two years ago
when a Blue Snow Gander left his mate when she started to incubate
and attempted to pair with another Blue Snow Goose who was
already paired ; this was a most unusual case for he did not return
to his Goose after she had hatched and was going about with three
Goslings. Hybrids among Geese are not so common as in Duck,
Greylag and White-fronted will breed together and Lesser Snow
and Blue Snow are very prone to mix up, and as the young are
fertile one can soon get rather a fearsome collection. I imported
once some wild-caught Blue Snow from America and one certainly
had Lesser Snow blood in it, so this mixing of the species may go on
in the wild state. Hybrids are rarely worth producing being as
a rule a poorer edition of both parents. The most beautiful hybrids
I ever saw were Egyptian X Ruddy Sheld-duck, an improvement
on both parents but alas with the most awful tempers and quite
impossible to keep with other birds. Geese, with the exception
of Cereopsis and Magellan, can be kept in numbers together if
sufficient space is given and rarely are bad tempered towards Duck.
Swans should not be kept with Geese as though Swans are gentle
with Duck, they will often attack Geese. We had a Bewick, a male
bird, who killed a number of Geese, and our Black-necked Swans
would, both male and female, bully the Geese considerably.
Coscoroba alone we have found quiet with Geese. Feeding
unquestionably affects fertility in Geese, too much grain being
harmful. Some grain in winter and early spring is of course essential,
but when grazing can be got they do best on that. Goslings, from
the day they hatch, should graze only. In only one species, the Blue
Snow, as day-olds for the first week of their life, have I noticed
that grazing alone was not all they expected, as they spend much
time diligently hunting every grass blade for minute insect life.
Young Greylag seem to graze as one might say straight forward
on all young growth that is short and sweet. Bernicle show a
preference for wild white clover as indeed do most Goslings, that
is those being reared under hens, but I have noticed when left
to their own mothers to rear they are by some species kept more on
the water than others, and taken to beds of watercress and duckweed
for their first feeds. Later on, as the Goslings grow, and so does

the grass, they then prefer to pick off the seed heads of many kinds
of grasses to the actual blades. At no age do they care about
eating rank grass, and Blue Snows show a marked liking for the
roots of grass which they bore holes to get at. Eggs of Geese hatch
more quickly and the young are stronger when hatched if Geese
incubate the eggs. I think this is due primarily to the continual
heat of unbroken incubation, for when set under hens one has to
take the hen off daily to feed and drink. It is a good plan to allow
the Goose to incubate the eggs until a day or two before they are
due to hatch then giving them to a hen, if possible leaving one or
two for the Goose to hatch herself. Geese can stand most severe
weather, though in their old age some will get rheumatic. Last
winter was intensely cold with the ponds here frozen to a foot in
depth and snow lay for months ; despite these conditions a pair
of Cereopsis nested in early February and produced fertile eggs.
Their nest being a scrape in the snow. During such weather it
will be noticed that Geese with black feet and legs seem to feel
the cold more than those with flesh-coloured or yellow legs and feet.
We had to feed considerably on grain as the birds could not get
down to the grass with the exception of the Red-breasted, who
appear to depend more on green food for a living than any other
species. The snow had to be swept clear on different portions of
grass for them daily. In these times, when grain cannot be readily
got, such a winter is a serious handicap, but during normal times
Geese have an advantage over most captive kept birds in that the
majority of their food should be grass. As I remarked we have had
removed all the outlying birds to one pen, but two Geese eluded
us and were left in one enclosure, a Bernicle and a Magellan ;
these two birds have been given no food at all since war was
declared and have gone through two of the hardest winters on
record--both birds look in splendid condition. Rushes in this
pen stood above the snow and presumably they must have lived
on them ; the Magellan, a female has laid six eggs and is paired
to the Bernicle.
Another advantage Geese have is that they are easily fenced in,
large mesh netting such as sheep netting will contain them and
small vermin that can enter, like weasels, stoats, or rats, they can
defend themselves from.

The New Zealand or Paradise Sheld-duck (Gasarea variegata)
The accompanying photograph represents a pair of New
Zealand Sheld-ducks with their brood of week-old young.
The white-headed bird is the female and the dark coloured
male is seen on the defensive in a very characteristic attitude with
bill to the ground. This pair were imported direct from
New Zealand. They nest annually and rear young at Lilford.
Muscovy Duck ( Cairina moschata)
The true wild Muscovy Duck is not very often seen in confine-
ment. A native of Paraguay, the name Muscovy appears to be
misleading, and is thought by some to be derived from the fact
that the species was first introduced into this country by an old
Muscovite trading company.
The same disparity of size in the sexes exists in the wild as in
the well known domestic form. The true wild type, however, is
more active and alert, and except for the usual white wing patch,
is entirely black in colour, glossed and overwashed with metallic
green and purple. The male has only slight indications of the
caruncles or face wattles so conspicuous in the domestic race.
A quaint and amusing species, the wild Muscovy is hardy
enough to live out of doors except during severe frost. I have
found them breed freely, but the powerful males are not usually
safe to trust with smaller waterfowl.
White-winged Wood Duck (. Asarcornis scutulata)
In size and general appearance this species bears some
resemblance to the Muscovy. It is, however, a much rarer bird,
and until recently was almost unknown in this country.
A native of India, the White-winged Wood Duck is said to
inhabit swampy woody situations. Our examples, I have noted,
are of a retiring nature. They creep about amidst herbage, and
when on the water show a preference for pools overhung with the
lower branches of trees.

A. F. MOODY-BREEDING OF AUSTRALIAN SHELD-DUGK 1 37
The male only slightly exceeds the female in size, and can be
distinguished by his whiter head and more brightly coloured bill.
Their general colouring may be described as of a rusty-blackish
brown, the redeeming features in the colour scheme of these large
sober plumaged birds being a beautiful lavender wing patch and a
certain amount of metallic green overwash on parts of their chest
and lower neck. I have not heard of the Wood Duck breeding in
captivity, but understand that there is one record of their having
hybridized with the domestic Duck. The present species stands our
climate tolerably well, but in Northamptonshire requires at least
protection from severe and continued frost. We confine them during
severe spells to a warm shed, bedded down with wheat straw.

A notice of the nesting of the Australian Sheld-duck at Lilford
appeared in the June number of the Avicultural Magazine,
1939 (page 202), written a few weeks after the hatching of the
young.
The first of the six eggs laid was during the last week of March.
Incubation commenced on 9th April and lasted thirty days. The
eggs were very similar to those of the Ruddy and New Zealand
Sheld-duck. The young on hatching were also similar but I think
the dark markings were more grey. The five young which left
the shell were reared by their parents in a small grass enclosure.
By 10th June they were feathering fast and showing colour on the
breast. Eventually they proved to be two males and three females,
two pairs of which were parted with on 8th September that year
to Messrs. R. and N. Stevens. The fifth is still at Lilford. This is
the first record of the breeding and rearing of the Australian
Sheld-ducks in the United Kingdom.

One of the more regrettable results of the disappearance of my
collection at Cleres is the destruction and dispersal of my unique
series of Wild Geese. The cool and even climate and the rich
grass and cold running waters of Normandy are particularly
suitable for Geese. During the last twenty years, I had patiently
built up my waterfowl collection and in 1939 every existing species
of Wild Goose, Sheld-duck and Tree-duck was present on my
grounds, as well as most other Ducks and Swans.
Many wild species of Geese have been bred at Cleres, some
in considerable numbers, and among others, a few of the rarest.
Our successes had equalled and even surpassed those of my late
friend F. E. Blaauw who, for half a century, kept an excellent
collection of Geese at Gooilust, in Holland, and reared young of
many species for the first time in captivity. After his death, a few
years ago, the more interesting specimens in his collection were
moved to Cleres. Of the commoner Geese--Canada, Grey-lag,
White-front, Bean, Pink-footed, Egyptian, Lesser Snow, and
African Spurwings, I only possessed a few odd specimens and
never bothered to try to multiply them, although some were
successful in nesting ; there was no space or time to waste on
them. But with practically all other species, I had succeeded in
building up a nice stock of breeding birds.
To start with the " true " Geese, I will mention a pair of
Siberian Bean Geese [Anser serrirostris ), sent to me from Japan by
the Marquess Kuroda ; these never nested. They are large and
rather ugly birds, of uncertain temper and unattractive.
Blue, Greater Snow, and Bar-headed Geese bred regularly and
without difficulty, only a few pairs being kept on the lake. Ross's
Snow Goose, a pretty and rare small species, the breeding grounds
of which were discovered only last year in Arctic north-west
America, was among our favourites. We kept seven or eight pairs
and since 1920 some were ,reared each year.
Emperor Geese did exceedingly well and during the last twelve
years a great many were reared at Cleres, from four or five breeding
pairs. It is also one of my favourite birds.

J. DELACOUR-GEESE I HAD AT CLERES I 39
The Lesser White-fronted Goose, an interesting and pretty
species, was also kept in some numbers and bred annually.
We had sixteen Red-breasted Geese and they started breeding
in 1939. Most of them had been reared and presented by the
late Duke of Bedford.
The last four small species were kept in the garden, with the
Flamingoes, Scarlet Ibises, Radjah Sheld-ducks and different Teal.
Some Hutchins' and Cackling Geese lived with them also, but
never nested.
A Hawaian gander, over forty years old, the only one in
Europe and a legacy from Mr. Blaauw, inhabited the garden
as well. He had very rheumatical legs and was taken in during
the winter, but otherwise was in good health.
On the lake, with the Snow Geese and the general collection
of ducks, was also kept a pair of the rare wild Chinese Geese, a
fine species, totally different in shape from the ugly domestic
breed. In 1940 they produced seven young, which I fear must
have been destroyed at the time of the invasion. The gander
had been wild caught in China, while the goose had been bred
by Messrs. Stevens. Barnacle and Brent Geese, including a Black
Brent, were also on the lake, but the latter never bred. I had to
remove to the deer park some White-cheeked Geese, from British
Columbia, as they proved spiteful to other species and to Goscoroba
Swans.
Semipalmated or Pied Geese never laid with us, nor the
Orinoco, which is surprising.
Maned Geese and both the South American and the African-
Indian Comb Ducks nested successfully in 1939 and we kept
many of them.
Several pairs of Cereopsis Geese, each in a pen, nested annually,
as well as Magellans, and we had great success with their rarer
relatives--Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Andean, and Blue-
winged. We usually kept in separate pens four mated pairs of
each, while younger birds lived in flocks in different meadows
until they became too old and savage to be left together. In the
case of the Andeans, however, we had to separate each pair after
the first year. We had great luck with this fine but difficult species
and since 1930 reared from four to eight annually.
In 1939 Mr. A. Morrisson brought me some fifteen Antarctic, or

Kelp, Geese (Chloephaga hybrida ), an exceptionally attractive species,
but they did poorly, although they fed well on cut-up lettuce, biscuit
meal, and powdered sea-weed. They suddenly died, for no apparent
reason, one after the other, until they were reduced to three birds
last year. We still have much to learn on the needs of this marine
species.
Common, Ruddy, Paradise, and South African Sheld-ducks
bred freely every year and in 1939 we reared three Australian
Sheld-ducks, for the first time in captivity. Radjahs, of which I
had the two subspecies since about 1925, never laid, but I had
many one-half and three-quarter hybrids with the Ruddy Sheld-
ducks. The species was bred last year for the first time by my
friend Mr. J. Spedan Lewis.
In June, 1940, when Cleres was abandoned, my pair of
Mountain Crested Ducks (.Lophonetta cristata alticola) were sitting
on eggs, for the first time in captivity. I have no idea what
happened, but naturally expect the worst.
I have mentioned the Sheld-duck and this last species for the
reason that I am convinced of their relationship with the Geese
of the Cereopsis-Chloephaga-Alopochen group.
I wonder if such a collection of Geese, so successfully established,
will ever be seen again ? If the English collections can survive
this war, the answer is in the affirmative, with the exception of
a few of the rarest species, and I wish the best of luck with their
birds to my friends, Mr. A. Ezra, Major A. Pam, Messrs. R. and
N. Stevens, Mr. J. Spedan Lewis, Mr. J. C. Laidlay, and the
Duke of Bedford. There are certainly now no collections in
continental Europe or North America which can compare with
theirs, but as Geese are mostly grass-eaters, one can hope that
they will be preserved throughout these dark years. It is particularly
important to maintain an adequate breeding stock of Ross's,
Emperor, Ashy-headed, Ruddy-headed, Blue-winged, Red-
breasted, and Chinese Geese, as well as of all the exotic Sheld-
ducks.
All our rare geese eggs were usually incubated under broody
hens, but hatched in an incubator to avoid the foster-mothers
crushing the goslings in the nest. They were then given back
to them when sufficiently dry and strong and reared in coops with
a run attached, placed on a good lawn and moved several times

than leaving the goslings to the care of their own parents, although

Although I have no running water, and all my ponds are small
and cemented, I have kept a good many very rare Ducks success-
fully, and have even bred some. All my ponds are small and
are overcrowded with different kinds of Ducks, and the birds
get no natural food in them at all.
The rarest Duck I have ever had is the Pink-headed Duck
(.Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) . At one time I had as many as ten of
these birds, and some of them lived over ten years. They inhabit
Eastern India, and are very rare indeed. The colour of the drake
is a deep golden brown with white rectrices. Bill, head, and neck,
excepting a narrow band in front, a beautiful rose colour. Feet
are brown. The duck's head and neck are brown shot with rose.
Although these birds lived in perfect condition for several years,
they never attempted to nest.
The Cotton Teal ( Nettopus coromandelianus) is a very small bird
with a short raised bill and short legs. When in colour in the spring
the drake is white with the back of the head black. The back and
part of the wings and a narrow collar are fine metallic green.
Tail grey with the primaries black and white. Bill and feet, black.
During the rest of the year the drake is white with grey spots
beneath, grey above with the top of the head and eyebrows grey.
The duck is the same, but has no white in her wings. These pretty
little birds are found in India, China, Indo-China, Malaysia, and
part of Oceania. I have kept them in perfect health for several
years, but lost them all in one night in the severe frosts of 1940,
when the thermometer registered 20 degrees of frost. They never
attempted to nest with me.
Eyton's Tree Duck ( Dendrocygna eytoni) is a native of Australia,
and the prettiest of the genus. Its shape is most graceful, and it

has a longer tail and a smaller bill than the other Tree Ducks. The

breast is light chestnut barred with black ; abdomen, tawny. Its
chief beauty consists of the feathers on its flanks, which are very
wide, long, and tapering, pale tawny yellow edged with black.
These feathers form like two fans, one on each side of the bird.
The bill is pale pink spotted with black ; feet, pink. Although these
birds come from the hottest parts of Australia, I find them the
hardiest I have ever kept. They stood the hard frosts of 1940,
when the thermometer registered 20 degrees of frost, and I did not
lose a single specimen out of the eight birds I have. They have
not attempted to nest with me.
The Ring-necked Teal (Anas torquata) is a native of Paraguay,
and to my mind it is undoubtedly the prettiest of all Teal, and
what makes it most attractive is that the drake never goes out of
colour, as he has no eclipse. The head of the drake is the colour
of sandstone, with a black crown, and a stripe of black on the neck
and half a black ring at the back of the neck. The breast is mottled
pink ; flanks, french grey finely pencilled ; back, chestnut ; bill,
blue-grey ; legs and feet, pink. The female is a light greyish buff
mottled with brown, with a black bill. I have found these birds
quite hardy and they have reared young here several times.
The Hottentot Teal {A. punctata) is a very pretty little species
which comes from South, South-West, and East Africa. It is a
brown bird speckled with black, with a pale yellow, black, and
blue-grey head. The wings are metallic green. They are
charming birds for a small pond, and are quite hardy.
The Versicolor Teal (A. versicolor), a South American species,
is also a very pretty bird, and does well in captivity. The head
is black on the crown and buff on the cheeks. The breast is spotted
and the body heavily pencilled, producing a grey effect. The sexes
are alike. I found these quite hardy to keep here.
The Madagascar White-backed Duck (Thalassornis leuconota
insularis) is a typical diving Duck, small, with short body, swims
low in the water with straight upstanding neck, and has a rather large
head and large feet. Its colour is various shades of brown with
black transverse stripes. Its actual back is, presumably, white,
though this does not show except in flight. It spends most of its

time on the water, diving frequently and obtaining much of its
food on the bottom. It is decidedly awkward on dry land.
Mr. Webb, the well-known collector, brought home a few of these
birds in 1930, and after he had placed most of them with well-
known waterfowl enthusiasts, had two left. I did not care to take
them, as I thought my ponds were unsuitable for such rare birds.
In the end Webb sent these two down to me, and I put them on
the small pond with my Mandarins, Carolinas, and Pink-headed
Duck. They did not only turn out to be a true pair, but they
actually nested in 1931. After sitting on three eggs for three weeks,
they deserted the nest. I then put the eggs under a broody hen,
and they all hatched out in perfect condition, but the ducklings
only lived for ten days. In 1932, early in April, I accidentally
found a nest on the island of the small duckpond. Hearing
some hissing, we looked to see where the sound came from, when
we suddenly found the bird sitting on three eggs in a very bad
temper at being disturbed. The nest was a very high one, and the
birds kept adding to it each time we saw it. Two of the three
eggs hatched out, but one of the young was found dead just outside
the nest. The other one was swimming along gaily with its parents,
and was the funniest little thing I have ever seen. As soon as it
saw any of us, it dived and kept under water for quite a long time.
The parents took great care of the baby, swimming on either
side of it, and no other Duck on the pond was allowed to get any-
where near it. The birds were given plenty of duckweed and
gentles, and in a few days the young one was tame enough to
come and feed with the parents. By the middle of June it was
impossible to know the young one from its parents. The old
birds sat again, and on the 12 th July hatched out five beautiful
young ones. Since then they have bred every year. I may mention
that Webb's was the first importation of this bird, and mine are
the only ones that lived well and bred. All the others imported
by Webb have died. These are the nicest and most amusing Ducks
I have ever kept. As they hardly ever left the water, I never
pinioned the young ones and they never flew away.
The White-winged Wood Duck (Asarcornis scutulata ) is found
in India, Indo-China, Malaya, and is very much the size of the
Muscovy Duck, and has the same habits. The head and neck are
white with black spots, and the rest of its plumage is golden brown,

THE EFFECT OF WAR CONDITIONS AND
HARD WINTER ON A WATERFOWL
COLLECTION IN SUTHERLAND

As regards my collection of ornamental waterfowl in Suther-
land :--In the first place I have very little time nowadays to devote
to the birds myself, and of course nearly all our men on the estate
have been called up ; so one of our remaining older keepers
and I try to cope with it in whatever time we can spare.
Fortunately I decided at the outbreak of war immediately to
concentrate on keeping only the rarer birds ; I also laid in what
food I could ; even so the supply of suitable food for them is
very short now. I had to harden my heart and kill off a great
many birds, practically all of which were eaten (not by me ! !).
I still have a lovely lot of Red-breasted Geese, these were
originally given me by the Duke of Bedford ; but it gave
me immense pleasure, and a great thrill, last year to see
my own young Red-breasted hatched here. I also have
Australian Maned, Ashy-headed, Lesser Snow, Bar-headed,
White-fronted, Pink-foot, and Greylag Geese. These now have
to be almost entirely self-supporting--easy enough in the summer,
but during a winter such as we had this year it was little short
of miraculous how they survived. I could only give them less
than a quarter of the grain they used to have pre-war. I gave
them what greens could be spared ; a few of them ate potatoes
cut up raw, but not all would eat these.
We had the worst snowstorm in living memory on 27th March
(this followed another very severe one in January), and even my

poor birds were buried under it, in fact one of my Brush Turkeys
was buried under a small bush for nine days ! ! We could find no
trace of him and thought he was dead, but when the snow began
to thaw, out he came quite hale and hearty ! This feat of endurance,
and test of stamina, could not, however, compare with that of
one of our ewes who--three weeks from lambing time--was buried
alive in this really terrible snowstorm, and who, finally freed
by the snow melting, walked out of a drift by herself twenty-two
days later ! During the first two or three days after this storm--
which caused the loss of two shepherds 5 lives, and lost us nearly
five hundred sheep--you can imagine that none of us had time to
really attend to the birds or hunt for those missing. We spent all
day long trying to find the missing men, and rescuing what poor
sheep we could, and it was in fear and trembling that I turned
my attention to my poor birds the moment I could.
I found all fences out of sight ! and parties of my birds, geese
especially, walking on the snow all over the place ! but they
came home, hoping for food, thank goodness. In view of the
appalling severity of the weather--the snow storm raged for two
nights and a day and a half, and was accompanied by about a
100 miles an hour gale--it was really marvellous how few of my
birds perished. I lost five Red-breasted, all my Mandarin drakes
(who were all full-winged), and several Teal, including Versicolor,
Cape, and Brazilian. It seemed curious to me how the Mandarin
drakes disappeared ; they were all paired, and their ducks are
pinioned. I think they must have attempted to fly from one
enclosure to the other, and literally got blown away, because when
the snow went we never found any trace of them.
Now the birds are all looking incredibly well, and are very
busy nesting, in fact it looks like being a particularly good nesting
season, which is very sad, as I have to take most of the eggs
away. I cannot let them rear clutches this year as it is impossible
for me to feed any more.
At the beginning of the war I had a flock of about forty Greylag
Geese, which I had reared here, with the intention of first
establishing a good flock of them, joint pinioned, and then allowing
their young to remain full-winged. I wanted to see if they would
remain here wild, or return here in the winter if they migrated,
and I hoped they might remain here to breed. Well, of course

I could not keep so many, and all but twelve had to go. These
twelve I took 3 miles lower down the river, to our home farm fields
by the loch side ; they have remained perfectly happily there all
the year and been entirely self-supporting. But each nesting season
they all solemnly troop up the road, and across the hill, to their
old enclosures 3 miles away ! They roam round and round the
enclosures, making a tremendous cackling and calling and although
there are now no Greylag inside these enclosures these poor birds
seemed desperately anxious to get back home ! As I could not
let them in (to eat the precious little bit of food I have for the
others !), they seemed to give up hope, and after a few days
back they went, and are once more quite happily settled at the
farm, where now some of them are undoubtedly nesting. Last year
none of them nested ; they seemed thoroughly upset by being
moved, and by not being allowed back to their old nesting places
inside the enclosures. During the bad weather it was terribly pitiful
to see the wild birds. Hundreds of Green Plover perished. I found
dozens of them frozen into the snow, so weak and thin they no
longer could fly, and just were frozen and starved to death ; a great
many Oyster-catchers died in the same way. The storm coming
so late in the year the birds had come in to nest, and the Oyster-
catchers and Green Plover would not go : but the Golden Plover
had only just arrived--we get hundreds of last year's hatched Golden
Plover coming back to this place every spring, these had just come--
and they disappeared completely, and have not come back.
Another new and most interesting experience for us is that a
splendid pair of Whooper Swans are nesting on our ground. Every
winter we get a number of them on our loch, but each spring they
leave us : this year, however, I am glad to say this pair has
remained and is starting to nest. We also have an unusual number
of Greenshanks nesting.

It is much to be hoped that when the world settles down to
sanity again that fascinating group of birds, the Anatidae, will be
just as popular as they were before the present upheaval, and let
us hope that those who have stocks of these birds may manage to
keep them going to form the nucleus of the fine collections that
will be formed when better days come.
I like to let my memory roam back to the more interesting of
those Ducks that I knew during my thirty years at the London
Zoological Gardens, and to feel again some shadow of that intense
excitement one experienced when some new species arrived or
brood of rarieties was hatched.
According to the most recent classification, the genus Anas now
includes the Pintails, Wigeon, and Teal, as well as the Mallard
group which were formerly its sole occupants. The latter are
certainly distinct enough to be worthy of a genus to themselves,
as indeed are the others, but the whole lot have been lumped
together in a confusing mass.
It is rather strange that of the Mallard group the only one
in which the sexes differ markedly in plumage is the Common
Mallard or Wild Duck {A. platyrhynchos) , all the others being more
or less dull-coloured in both sexes. Meller's Duck from Madagascar
and the American Dusky or Black Duck (A. rubripes) strike one as
particularly uninteresting species though the Australian Wild
Duck ( A . superciliosa) , the Indian Spot-bill (A. poecilorhyncha) , and
its Eastern form (A. p. zonorhyncha) as well as the African Yellow-
bill {A. undulata) are all handsome and desirable species.
The difficulty in keeping any of these Ducks of the Mallard type
together is that they recognize their affinity to one another and
hybridization takes place. The African Black or Speckled Duck
(A. sparsa) is perhaps the most interesting of the Mallards, though
it is very rare. It is a striking Duck of dark grey plumage, its back
conspicuously speckled and barred with white. Its habits differ
considerably from those of the others in that it is of a solitary
nature, and only found singly or in pairs in the African rivers.
The consequence is that it is very impatient of the company of

other Ducks, and a breeding pair would have to be kept by them-
selves unless on a very large piece of water.
Many years ago the London Zoo had several examples of the
pretty Marbled Duck from Southern Europe, but for the last
thirty years or more none appear to have been imported. Its
grey plumage, marked with darker blotches, give it a distinctly
marbled appearance, and to me its name will always be remembered
as Marmaronetta though, I suppose, we must follow out systematists
and call it Anas angustirostris. In the same way we of the older
school will always think of the Wigeon as Mareca.
All of the Wigeon, which are now crowded into the genus Anas,
are very desirable birds, and so long as they have access to plenty
of short, tender grass, they will thrive well and probably breed.
I remember a Duck of the Common Wigeon that lived for a number
of years at the London Zoo with full wings, and every year made
her nest in the middle of a flower border near the Three-island
Pond. The Head Gardener took a great interest in her, and
delayed pulling up the old wallflower plants and replanting with
summer flowers until she had brought off her brood. When this
happened, she would march her family round to the gate leading
to the enclosure and wait until someone opened it for her.
The American Wigeon (A. americana) was formerly very rare
in collections here and, if I remember aright, W. H. St. Quintin
was the first to own and breed it. In later years it became much
better known. The drake is a very handsome bird and quite
distinct from our red-headed species, but the ducks of the two
are very much alike except that the American is considerably
darker than the European. In the third species, the Chiloe Wigeon
(A. sibilatrix ), of the southern parts of South America, the sexes
are more or less alike, though they can readily be distinguished by
the brighter colours of the drake. Like other Southern Hemisphere
Ducks, it has no eclipse plumage and both parents tend the young.
The Common Pintail, formerly known as Dafila acuta, now as
Anas acuta, is the only one of the Pintails in which the sexes differ,
and the drake is certainly one of the most elegant of Ducks. Although
it is apparently so distinct, it has been found to cross readily with
the Mallard and to produce fertile hybrids. Possibly this readiness
to interbreed in ducks may have influenced those who have been
responsible for including so many in one genus. The male of the

common Pintail goes into a complete eclipse and takes no part in
the rearing of the offspring, whereas the other Pintails, the Bahama
(A. bahamensis) , the South African Redbilled (A. erothrorhyncha ),
and the Chilian Pintail (A. spinicauda), are alike in the sexes, have
no eclipse, and both parents tend the young.
The Teal have always been to me the most fascinating of the
Ducks on account of their small size, beautiful colours in many
of them, and the readiness with which they take to a life in captivity ;
many of them, moreover, breed quite freely. One has always
known them as occupying the two genera Querquedula and Nettion ,
and to lump them in with the larger Ducks in the one genus Anas
as has been done, seems about as sensible as it would be to place
the smaller Falcons with the Eagles !
The Chestnut-breasted Teal (A. castanea) is one of the most
prolific in captivity. I am inclined to think that there were none
in this country before 1908. Its name appears in the Zoological
Society's List before that, but from an examination of a series of
skins of Ducks in the Zoo collection it appears that specimens
labelled castanea belonged in reality to the nearly allied A. gibberi -
frons. The first examples of the true Chestnut-breasted Teal that
I ever saw were two pairs in the garden of the late Mrs. Roberts,
in Hobart, in the early part of 1908. I was much struck by them and
persuaded Mrs. Roberts to let me take them to London. They bred
so freely and reared their ducklings so successfully during the next
few years that the Zoological Society was able to supply not only
English duck-keepers, but most of the Zoological Gardens of
Europe, and I am not sure that we did not send some to America
as well. So far as I know there have been few, if any, importations
since, so it is not surprising if the European stock of this Teal is
becoming very in-bred.
In the Slender or Grey Teal [A. gibberifrons) , which is also
Australian, both sexes closely resemble the female of A. castanea ,
and another closely allied species is the Andaman Teal (A. albogu-
laris) , which normally has a white ring around the eye and a white
throat, but after being in captivity for some time develops a con-
siderable amount of white on the head and neck. A chance
importation of these Teal to the London Zoo some thirty-five
years ago kept the Gardens stocked with the species for many
years as it bred very freely, but there was nothing very attractive

about it. It seems now to have entirely died out on account of
in-breeding as there have been no further importations.
One of the most interesting birds I met with in Australia was the
Musk Duck (Biziura lobata) which was quite common in the West.
We netted some on one of the lakes, and I brought them home for
the Zoo where they survived for some years. It is a somewhat ugly
creature that would never become very popular, but interesting
on account of its rarity here and its peculiar appearance. It is
dark brown in colour with a large lobe or wattle hanging from the
throat, and, so far as I remember, we fed it upon meat and fish.
The Australian Sheld-duck was common enough in those
lakes and marshes, and is known there as the Mountain Duck.
It used to be thought that it would never breed in captivity, but
last year both Captain Delacour and Mr. Moody succeeded in
inducing it to do so.
One could ramble on about Ducks for some time, but space
will not permit.

International Wildfowl Inquiry, Vol. I. Factors Affecting
the General Status of Wild Geese and Wild Duck. Published
by The Cambridge University Press. Price 6 d .
It will be remembered that in October, 1938, Mr. Seth-Smith,
through a personal appeal published in the Avicultural Magazine,
commended to us the British Section of the International Com-
mittee for Bird Preservation, and that a leaflet setting forth the
constitution, achievements, and present activities of the British
Section accompanied that number of the Magazine. Perhaps the
most difficult and certainly not the least urgent of those activities
was the undertaking of an inquiry into the status of Wildfowl
throughout Europe, and an investigation into the factors affecting
that status--unhappily too many of those factors being adverse
ones, causing a decrease in wildfowl that has for some time been
giving rise to no inconsiderable alarm.
A special sub-committee was appointed for this highly important
undertaking, and here, in this first volume, we have a record of

some three years of splendid work in eight papers contributed by
specialists. In the Introduction, the Chairman, Dr. P. R. Lowe,
sets out the history of events leading to the formation of the sub-
committee, explains the present disquieting state of European
Anatidae and the factors conspiring to bring about a very serious
deterioration of that state, wisely pointing out the lessons to be
learned from the condition of affairs in the North American Con-
tinent and the measures already taken there.
The paper, " Conditions in Northern Breeding Areas of Wild-
fowl," is contributed by Messrs. C. G. and E. G. Bird, Major
W. M. Congreve, Messrs. S. W. P. Freme, and C. T. Dalgety,
Captain J. H. McNeile, and Dr. E. S. Steward.
These contributions, the personal observations and views of
these ornithologists and sportsmen, who have visited the areas
concerned, present a tragic picture (but little relieved by news of
the existence of some areas, such as N.E. Greenland, where at
least some wildfowl may breed in peace) of the depredations of
both man and in no small degree of natural enemies. Suggestions
are inade in regard to measures to diminish the appalling devasta-
tion done by the egg-hunters at Spitzbergen and elsewhere who do
not even discriminate between fresh and incubated eggs and
whose activities constitute so grave a menace, especially to Brent
Geese.
Dr. R. W. Butcher contributes a masterly paper on the
" Distribution of Zostera (Eel Grass, Wigeon Grass), and other
Seashore Plants in Relation to the Migrations of Wildfowl ", and
this extremely valuable paper is accompanied by diagrams.
" British Decoys," a paper submitted by Captain H. A. Gilbert,
assisted by Messrs. Colin McLean, C. W. Mackworth Praed, and
H. Leyborne Popham, presents a survey of great interest of the
small and decreasing number of decoys fully or partly in use in
Great Britain and the glad tidings that decoys as commercial
undertakings are likely to die out in this country.
" Punt-gunning," by Mr. C. T. Dalgety, assisted by Messrs.
R. A. H. Coombes, H. A. Gilbert, H. Leyborne Popham, and
T. Russell-Goddard, gives us the surprising truth concerning this
sport. There is no doubt that the general impression was that
punt-gunning inflicted severe losses on wildfowl and that that
unhappy element in any shooting, the proportion of wounded,

possibly when the gunning is undertaken by the inexperienced,
while the numbers killed and wounded by the most skilful are
small.
&lt;c Ringing of Duck at British Decoys for the Wildfowl Inquiry
Committee 55 will be read with the greatest interest by all. It
would be superfluous to stress how essential to the preservation of
all but the comparatively stationary birds is the ringing, defining,
as it does, seasonal movements and the paths of migration.
In recounting the ringing done at the well-known Orielton
decoy, Pembrokeshire. Mr. Mackworth Praed mentions, en passant ,
the astonishing homing abilities of Coots and Moorhens. Further
on he states that " the sense of smell of all surface-feeding Duck
is acute, but a burning piece of peat held in front of the mouth
kills the smell of man completely : the difference can be demon-
strated any day 55 .
This belief has been held by wildfowlers for a great many years
and Dr. Stanley (History of Birds , 1851), speaks of it as an
established fact.
I do not know if it has been proved, but Mr. Praed's assertion
certainly seems to bear it out, unsupported though it is by the
well-known method of catching Duck in Northern South America
and the East.
Of no less absorbing interest is the paper, " Results of Ringing
Duck : General Survey of Data from all Sources, 55 by Dr. A.
Landsborough Thomson. This survey which, like the foregoing
paper, is illustrated with maps, gives us information concerning
the ringing of Duck since its inception some thirty years ago.
The Wild Birds' (Duck and Geese) Protection Act, 1939,
promoted by the British Section of the International Committee
for Bird Preservation is, it need hardly be said, a very considerable
contribution to the preservation of these birds, allowing in general,
as it does, an extra month of protection to the paired birds early
in the year and eleven precious days at the end of the breeding
season, besides the benefit to birds in other European countries
gained by the clause which prohibits the importation of wildfowl
from 1 st February to nth August.

paper, " Close Time," by Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, the new
Act, as well as certain important features of the former relative
Acts, are explained with a clarity that is at once highly com-
mendable and very welcome.
This paper concludes with an appeal to all European countries
for an adequate " close season " so very essential to the welfare
of wildfowl.
Here, then, in this volume, which is well printed, well bound,
and worthy of its distinguished contributors, we have inspiring
evidence of the sound work already done by the British Section :

From an Aviculturist in South Africa
Mr. J. H. Abrahams, writing to the Hon. Secretary, says :--
Though in South Africa we are not nearly so worried about our birds, nor
are our lives endangered by that dreadful bombing as you are in England, I,
nevertheless, am kept really very busy on war work.
During the last eighteen months I cannot remember having a day at home
with the birds. Everybody seems war-minded, even our bird boy, after twelve
years' faithful service, just suddenly disappeared, without giving the customary
notice or saying good-bye, and " joined-up ". Consequently the whole responsi-
bility has now fallen to my good wife. Very fortunately for myself and the little
birds my wife loves them all and they get first rate attention. Nevertheless you will
readily appreciate what it means to have the extra work of three people suddenly
tossed on to your shoulders.
There is always a lot of necessary " donkey-work " which has to be done,
which plays a big part in successful bird keeping. There are termites, grass seeds,
and bushes to gather and install, which all has an important bearing on a successful
breeding season. It is this " donkey-work " that is sadly missing. Nevertheless
my good lady has been doing her bit and here is the result of her efforts for the
breeding season now fast ending. Nests of young bred and reared to full maturity
include : Blue Breasted Waxbills, Red-headed Parrot Finches, White Zebras,
Blue-faced Parrot Finches, Diamond Finches, Painted Finches (True Australian
P.F.), Gouldian Finches, Long-tailed Grass Finches, Masked Finches X Long-
tailed Grass Finches, Fawn Bengalese, White Bengalese, and Bicheno's Finch.
Others that went to nest but which failed to rear their young to maturity
include the South American Red Crested Finch, the Australian Star Finch
(B. ruficauda ), Red-faced Waxbill (Pytelia melha ). Perhaps the most interesting
of these, at the same time the most disappointing and worrying, has been the
experience with the Red Crested Finch from South America. Last breeding
season they had no less than eight nests and two so far this season, but she has
failed on every occasion to rear her babies to maturity. Only on one occasion
did the young reach the feathered stage. The remainder died about nine days old.

This was naturally very worrying indeed ; the thought of all those youngsters
being lost, perhaps through our ignorance, made my wife's heart feel very sore,
particularly because they were such a charming pair of birds and more so when
they had young in the nest. They gave us lots to think about. It was felt that
perhaps they were not getting sufficient flying insects, yet the aviary stands
surrounded by fruit trees, vines, and creeper, and insects are always about.
Live food, in the form of termites, green and soft food are always available.
However, notwithstanding all this, we put ourselves out to find flying-termites,
when she had young in the nest, but despite all our efforts, we have not had
the pleasure of seeing any youngsters on the perches. When incubating the hen
was so tame that she would feed from my wife's hand while actually sitting on
the nest. When young were in the nest the hen would feed from my wife's hand
after closely waiting for her to enter the aviary door, then fly off to her nest with
the wings of the insects hanging out on both sides of her beak. It was a common
sight to see both parents, loaded with insects in this fashion, sitting on the edge
of the nest and the youngsters with their little outstretched necks and beaks wide
open greedily begging for food. Just imagine that pretty picture and the con-
sequent feeling of disappointment when you realize you haven't a youngster to
show after such an interesting and pretty experience. Nevertheless the beauty
and charm of the parents, during these periods, is a sight we will always remember.

THE SOLITARY LORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9982836" page_id="56239336"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
Mr. Patten's observations on the Ruffed or Solitary Lory {Phigys solitarius),
and Mr. Seth-Smith's note which accompanied the article, will have been read
with great pleasure, especially by those who know this rare and handsome Lory.
As a point of interest it should perhaps be added that Lord Tavistock was
presented with a pair of these birds by Dr. Derscheid in 1937 and that, after
some partial successes, two young were bred in the autumn of 1939, and one, at
least, has been bred since.
I am informed that since 1937 the pair has nested often, and that a number
of eggs, in clutches of never more than two, have been laid. Some eggs have
been broken in the nest, a small percentage of survivors have been infertile, and
a rather large proportion have contained dead chicks. I think it may not be
correct to say that the normal clutch is three or four ; two seems to be the usual
number with Lories, and unless the nest was exceptionally porous underneath
and extremely well ventilated above, the presence of three or four young Lories
inside would, in tropical heat, produce an atmosphere that does not bear thinking
about. Because of the usual Lory habit of being often together in the nest, I think
that a nest with an inside diameter of 6 inches is rather too small ; if I remember
rightly, the nest used at Haywards Heath was of 7 inches inside diameter, and
that a good depth of crumbled decayed wood and peat moss kept it reasonably
dry and clean.

I saw one of the first young ones in early 1940 ; its beak and feet were then
almost yellow and the bird, which resembled the parents, could easily be dis-
tinguished from them by its duller plumage.
The parents are still at Haywards Heath, and the young are elsewhere in
England.

I was most interested in Mr. Seth-Smith's note on the Ruffed or Solitary
Lory, as mine is the bird he refers to at the London Zoo. The Duke of Bedford
has some of these birds in his collection, from which he bred two in 1938 ; but
they did not survive long. The one I have was fully reared by him in 1940, and
was nine months old when I bought it. It is a very bright and lively bird, con-
tinually climbing about its cage, and loves bathing. It does very well on bread
and milk, honey, and a little apple. I found when the bird was in Devon it
could stand a good deal of cold during the winter months. It can stand the
temperature of a room without a fire in the winter, and is altogether very hardy.
It is a great pity that more are not imported from Fiji, as this Lory makes a very
charming cage bird.

tragic account of the loss of Cleres and the " News About Sparrows
The loss of Cleres is a heavy blow, because to many, like myself, who dream
about what they would do if they had the where-with-all, such is a realization of
one's ambitions, which while personal, is largely shared by the whole world of avi-
culture and science. The concluding sentence in M. Delacour's article about hold-
ing material possessions in too great esteem, does not apply in the sense of avarice
to a collection of the beauties of nature and their study, care, and propagation
for the benefit of the whole interested world, nor to the books and literature of
a favourite subject. I hope that some day when Right has slain Might and brutality
that M. Delacour will again realize his life's ambition and the bitterness of his
dreadful losses of these times will be a memory obliterated almost to oblivion in
a new world of aviculture and books reborn.
And about Sparrows. My hearty congratulations to Mr. A. H. Scott who has
come forward as the Sparrow's champion. His article is an eye-opener, and on
a par with say the full story of the Cuckoo's domestic affairs. I am certain that
article will make many of us think differently about the cheeky Sparrow and
regard him as a person to be studied.

THE GRIFFON VULTURE IN CAPTIVITY
By G. S. Mottershead
Director-Secretary, North of England Zoological Society
Griffon Vultures are not every aviculturist's fancy, but a few
remarks about the successful breeding of these at Chester Zoological
Gardens in 1940 may be of interest.
I first saw this particular pair of Griffon Vultures about
1929-1930. They were then kept in an aviary about 12 feet
square, containing a platform on which they could build a nest.
I was given to understand that they had laid but had been
unsuccessful in hatching the egg.
In 1933, however, the pair came to Chester Zoo, and were
placed in an open aviary somewhat larger than the one in which
they had been previously.
As it was April when they arrived, no attempt at breeding
took place that year, but the following February they showed
signs of wanting to nest. They set about building one on a plat-
form near the top of the aviary, from some twigs which had
previously been placed inside for them, and in due course an egg
was laid.
The egg, which is somewhat larger than the average goose
egg, is a dirty white in colour, and the shell is of a rough texture.
Unfortunately, this egg was left by the hen after sitting for a
period of eight weeks, and on examination it proved to be infertile.
Later that same year the birds were moved to a much larger
aviary against a building with an overhanging roof, thus providing
them with some shelter.

I58 G. S. MOTTERSHEAD-THE GRIFFON VULTURE IN CAPTIVITY
A platform had been erected underneath this projecting roof,
and in 1935 and 1936 a nest was built and an egg laid, but in
both cases no results were obtained.
In February, 1937, an egg was laid. It, however, rolled off
the platform and broke, but in March they laid again and after
the hen had sat on this egg for what appeared to be about eight
weeks, we thought it time to remove it, as we wanted to give the
aviary a good cleaning, particularly the platform which becomes
a filthy mess during this time. Whilst examining the egg we
thought we could discern a tapping noise inside it, so it was at once
replaced, but the following morning no trace of the egg or chick
could be found.
I felt convinced that with the shell being hard, the parents
had tried to liberate the chick but had eaten it in the process.
The following year saw another egg laid, but after eight weeks
the hen left it, and I subsequently discovered that it contained a
perfect chick dead in the shell.
Apparently the nest was too sheltered, and the egg had been
kept too dry. I, therefore, moved the platform out into the open,
where apart from catching the normal rainfall, it would receive,
on very wet days, a deluge from the adjoining roof.
In the February of 1939 they laid again, but once more mis-
fortune overtook them, for we discovered the egg on the floor,
cracked. As it would have a fall of over ten feet from the nest,
I could only presume that for some reason or another the egg had
been laid on the floor.
In March the birds laid again and after sitting on the egg for
a little over six weeks, it hatched and all went well until the end
of June, when after a particularly violent thunderstorm we dis-
covered the chick on the floor of the aviary badly hurt, and it died
soon afterwards.
Quite oblivious to the extreme arctic weather in February of
1940, the Griffon Vultures started carrying bits of fur up to the
platform, which was then many inches thick with trodden snow,
so some twigs were provided and on the 23rd February they laid
an egg, despite the fact that we were experiencing several degrees
of frost.
This egg took fifty-eight days to incubate, and on the 21st April

G. S. MOTTERSHEAD-THE GRIFFON VULTURE IN CAPTIVITY 1 59
a fine healthy chick was hatched. I attribute the extra time to
incubate being due to the very cold weather.
When hatched the chick is about the size of a fat pigeon and
is covered with white fluff. It grows very rapidly and begins to
feather after about twenty-eight days and appears to be fully
feathered after about nine weeks. It does not, however, show any
signs of leaving the nest and the parents begin to carry the meat
up to the platform and eat it in front of the young one.
To my knowledge the hen only, feeds the chick and this she
does immediately after feeding herself. I have never seen the cock
bird perform this duty, and as far as my observations went the cock
simply acted as a guardian.
On 9th August the young bird was almost as large as its parents,
and on that day it left the nest, to become quite independent,
fighting with the other Vultures in the aviary for its food.
The young Griffon is much more handsome than its parents,
its plumage being of a nutty brown colour. The ruff, which is
white in the adult bird, being a rich brown, also the leg feathers
are a rich brown in colour.
This young bird is now over a year old and so far these colours
show no signs of changing to that of the parents.
The old birds have laid again this year, but after sitting for
over six weeks, I discovered that all trace of the egg had completely
vanished, they apparently having eaten it.
Although the Griffon Vulture appears an extremely nervous
bird, this successful breeding took place in view of all the Zoo
visitors entering the Lion House, the nest being only a few feet
from them.

In general the Waders are, I consider, among the most charming
of aviary birds, for though few of them could be said to be colourful,
most have a distinctive elegance of form, a friendliness of disposition,
and a certain gentility of manner, as if they were by nature
well-bred.
I never think of Waders without being reminded of two strange
facts in connection with them.
One is that Avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta) have bred at the
London Zoo, one young being fully reared--perhaps one of the
most remarkable events in aviculture, for though one would not
have expected the parent birds to be too discomposed by the
presence of other Waders, it is extraordinary that they were not
completely discouraged by the large numbers of human spectators.
It is also curious that although Waders are generally exceedingly
shy birds in nature, they become fairly tame very soon after being
taken into captivity.
When watching these birds on the mud-flats on the northern
shore of the Isle of Wight, where one may see a fair variety at
most times of the year, I have noticed that it is impossible, except
in very severe weather, to approach to within a quarter of a mile
of them, for there, at any rate, they are very nervous and suspicious
of human beings and can only be identified with field-glasses.
I have sometimes wondered why the wading birds were not
more widely kept ; they are not difficult and the amount of water
they require would not, I am sure, be too much trouble to supply
in any garden aviary, for, though a fairly large area of water is
naturally best, it should not be much more than one inch deep
for small Waders nor more than three inches deep for the large
ones--indeed if it is much deeper than this they will not wade in
it, and I am certain that if they do not wade they will not thrive
and their feet will quickly become diseased.
Dr. Derscheid used to get Waders from a Dutch dealer ; they
were, I think, always caught in Holland (but I cannot imagine how
this apparently difficult feat was carried out) and were always
quite recently taken. On arrival these birds were without exception
extremely thin : the travelling boxes contained as food soaked

biscuit meal and dried fish--a diet which I have no doubt the
birds did not find exciting and which very probably accounted for
their emaciated condition. They were, nevertheless, generally
in good health, but it always took a long time to get them to normal
proportions. The plumage was sometimes rather poor and had
always lost its waterproofing, so that heavy rain would drench them
and, as they at first did not like to go under cover, it was difficult
to keep them dry and we sometimes had to catch them and put
them inside when the night promised to be wet and cold.
After a few weeks, however, the feathers regained their water-
proofing and the birds could safely be left out in rain.
In 1938 we received a few large Waders, including a single
Avocet, two Oyster-catchers (. Hamatopus ostralegus ), two Curlews
(Numenius a. arquata ), one of the rotund Grey or Silver Plover
{Squatarola s. squatarola ), two Bar-tailed Godwits ( Limosa l. lapponica ),
a Lapwing ( Vanellus vanellus ), a Ruff and Reeve ( Philomachus
pugnax), and two Redshanks {Tringa totanus).
We did not keep these long because the aviaries were not so
suitable for them as for the smaller species which came later.
The small Waders are, I think, much more attractive than the large
ones, though the Avocet is an exception and is, perhaps, the
nicest of all, while the Redshank is one of the most elegant of the
medium-sized ones. Of the small European Waders none is more
charming than the Ringed Plover ( Charadrius h. hiaticula ), whose
round head and large dark eye give it the appearance of a kind
of wading Robin. Several of these came at different times and all
were quite tame : they seem also to be more nocturnal in habit
than most and long after dusk could be seen making their
characteristic short swift runs about the aviary. The Dunlins
(&amp;apos;Calidris olpina) , of which we had four, were rather wild : they
seemed to be of no especial interest except for their comical shape,
which reminds one rather of a child's drawing of a bird.
The Common Sandpiper ( Tringa hypoleucos ), of which we had
several, seems quite unlike the other Waders in temperament and
all those we had were very shy and liked to hide themselves in the
bamboos. I think they come inland a good deal which may
account for their very Rail-like habits.
There were two Little Stints ( Calidris minuta) and a single
Temminck's Stint (C. temminckii) in the collection and they were

among the nicest of all. It was amusing to see them eating meal-
worms--and the swallowing of a mealworm more than half-
grown was for them a difficult undertaking, but, having grasped
it squarely after running it several times through the beak, they
would, by little movements of the beak and tongue, make it travel
jerkily upwards as if conveyed by some little unseen escalator.
A single Curlew-Sandpiper (Calidris testacea) came in 1939,
but I do not recall that it was of any special interest.
The Ringed Plovers and some of the others had the curious
habit when resting on one leg of being too lazy to put the other
to the ground when they wanted to move, preferring to do the
journey by hops--I at first thought they were lame, but that was
not so.
In 1939 Dr. Derscheid received an Avocet of about three weeks
old and still in the bluish-grey down and with it came a Lapwing
nearly fully feathered. These were reared together in a brooder
without any difficulty, becoming fine well-grown birds.
At the same time a freshly-laid Avocet's egg and four partly
incubated eggs of Redshank came : the Avocet's egg we put under
a Bantam and it hatched on, I think, the 23rd day, while the
Redshank's eggs which were put into an incubator hatched after
about three days.
The young Redshanks were very pretty--rather like little balls
of some lichen in reddish brown and cream : they were all fully
reared but at about two or three weeks old all four developed
twisted necks, the cause of which we were quite unable to discover.
It was certainly not rickets, for the birds were too healthy and
otherwise well-formed for that, nor was it sunstroke, but I suspect
that the food caused them to grow too quickly.
I have seen the same thing in perfectly healthy Carolina Ducks,
and one may often see in Tragopans and other Pheasants a well-
grown and healthy bird with one or more twisted toes--I feel
certain that this is not due to rickets and that true rickets occurs
only in weakly and undersized birds.
Though these four Redshanks were reared and were fully as
large as the wild-caught ones they did not improve in the matter
of their twisted necks. All went well with the Avocet, but
unhappily at about ten days old it was accidentally drowned--
we had a large number of newly-hatched Sea-ducks at the time

so could not spare a brooder and pen for the Avocet and were
obliged to keep it with a few Long-tailed ducklings which, of
course, needed deep water for diving.
The young Waders were fed at first on fresh ants' eggs, small
earth-worms, small strips of bullock's heart and some mosquito
larvae and, later, on a proprietary food mixture (which contained
biscuit-meal, meat-meal, dried egg yolk, ants' eggs, and even a little
crushed hemp !) as well as a few mealworms in addition to the
earth-worms and so on. The adults were fed on the proprietary
food already mentioned made moist and mixed with a little mashed
potato and sometimes hard-boiled egg. In addition they were given
either mealworms or strips of bullock's heart every day and some-
times fresh ants' eggs or earth-worms.
After the commencement of the war it was difficult to get the
ready-mixed food so then we gave as a substitute for it a mixture
of crumbled duck-bread (a bread made for the Sea-ducks com-
posed of wheat flour, barley-meal, meat-meal, fish-meal, yeast, and
salt), mashed potato, hard-boiled egg, and a few dried flies.
For the winter we put the Waders (then increased by the
addition of a further seven Avocets) into a large room with a pool
of water in the corner and the floor covered with peat moss. It
has, I think, been said that there is a danger of Waders' feet
becoming frost-bitten in an outdoor aviary with fresh water and
that in nature they are afforded protection by the salt water, but
as shallow parts of the sea sometimes freeze without causing injury
to the wild birds' feet, it may be that there is little danger.
One trouble we had with a few individual birds was the forma-
tion of small swellings on the feet : these resembled corns, but
underneath there was an accumulation of pus and the trouble was
very hard to cure.
We did not find the cause--such a thing might have been a
result of too rich a diet or to absence of salt in the sand, but not,
I think, in these cases to lack of wading, for the birds went a good
deal into the water and kept their feet very clean.
I think that Waders look best in an aviary with no grass or
plants except, perhaps, a few small clumps of rushes--a rather
short greyish green species which grows in fields, not the large
bright green one which is more aquatic and very untidy--and
covered with sand relieved here and there by a rock, the whole

being suggestive of the sea shore which is, of course, the perfect
setting for all Waders.
I also think that comparatively few Waders in an aviary look
better than a lot : a pair in a small aviary present a prettier
picture than a lot in a large one, but the drawback would be, of
course, that some species are very difficult to sex.
Sea-sand would, I am sure, be better for the aviary than pit or
river-sand : we could get nothing but Rhine sand which quickly
becomes discoloured by a kind of algae and which no amount of
raking can destroy.
In the absence of plants it would no doubt be a good thing to
sprinkle salt all over the sand now and then for this would prevent
the algaeic growth, disinfect the aviary and would, perhaps, be
good for the birds' feet.
But for the war we should have tried rearing a large number of
the various Waders in 1940 : this would in itself have been very
interesting and it would have been of far greater interest to see if,
as in Waterfowl, the hand-reared females would nest in captivity
more readily than the wild-caught ones. However, no doubt
someone will eventually be able to make the effort--I hope so,
for the wild-caught birds seem to be very shy breeders, and I can
think of nothing in aviculture more fascinating than the breeding of
the small Waders.
In the absence of the parents, incubation of the small Waders'
eggs could, of course, only be done in incubators and the rearing
of all sizes could only be done with any success in brooders, for
I am sure that the smallest bantam would be altogether too
clumsy to rear even the large Waders. Moorhens (Gallinula
c. chloropus) should, of course, not be mentioned in this article,
but as they are not worth a note to themselves I will make here a
few remarks about the rearing of some. For the purpose of sending
two or three pairs to the U.S.A. we hatched and reared nine :
they were reared in a brooder with a few ducklings and were very
easy to manage. For the first two or three days after they were
ready to feed we were obliged to give them their food on the end
of a stick or in the fingers. They were at first rather sleepy, very
unsteady on their feet, and altogether comical, picking at the food
in a curiously drunken way, but thereafter they fed themselves
and were no trouble. For a time they were quite tame, but they

gradually became more nervous and were eventually, I think,
wilder than the wild ones. When adult they did well on soaked
duck-bread and a little Waders' food : it was curious that they
also ate apples and lettuce which were going to seed leaving only
the fibrous part of the stem and the roots. At the beginning of the
war when it was evident that we could not very well send them
away, I took them to a near-by marsh and liberated them. From
the alacrity with which they disappeared into the reeds it was
clear that they were entirely in favour of war, while I was very
glad to see the last of those scrambling idiots.

A feature of nineteenth and early twentieth century literature
is the number of splendid ornithological monographs, which
include some of the finest and most costly books ever published.
These books were produced mainly between the years of 1840
and 1920 by the leading ornithologists of the day, usually for
wealthy patrons, various large libraries, and natural history societies
of the world.
Each covers very exhaustively a single family or genus of foreign
birds and all are illustrated with very beautiful coloured plates,
the likes of which we shall no doubt never see again, as the method
of reproducing them is far too costly for modern production.
These plates were lithographed from stone and then coloured by
hand. They were drawn by the great bird artists of the Victorian
era such as Wolf, Hart, Thorburn, but mainly by Keulemans, the
most prolific of these famous artists.
The editions of the monographs were usually limited to about
a hundred copies, sometimes only fifty. They are of great use to
the aviculturist who takes his hobby seriously, for not only are
they an aid to identifying birds, but they give the life history and
full accounts of the wild foods, etc.
The price of the books varies according to the binding and the
state they are in ; naturally copies in fine leather binding by such
well-known binders as Riviere fetch much more than copies in
cloth covers, but it is the contents that are the main interest to
the aviculturist and not the covers, and he can always have a
poorly bound book rebound if he feels like giving himself a birthday
or Christmas present at any time!
While a proportion of these literary works are beyond the means
of the average person quite a few are within reach of the man with
a modest income. They are really an investment as they will never
lose their value and will doubtless appreciate in worth in time to
come, especially as many valuable libraries are being lost by
enemy action.

To the aviculturist one of the most useful of these monographs
is the Monograph of the Weavers , which can be purchased for as low
a figure as 35^., while two very beautiful volumes, the Monograph
of the Bee-eaters and the Monograph of the Rollers are valued at from
#4 to #6. Another work useful to the keeper of parrot-like birds
is the Monograph of the Lories ; this has sixty-one life-size and hand-
coloured plates of these gorgeous birds, but some of the plates are
rather badly coloured and not up to Keulemans' usual standard.
This work has a fixed price of # 6 ioj-. Another book very useful
to the bird keeper, with over 120 exquisite hand-coloured plates,
is Shelley's Sunbirds, this is one of the most beautiful of the mono-
graphs, but the price is rather high, being about # 16 when obtain-
able, which is not often. Seebohm's Thrushes is another of these
useful works and is one of the best bird books ever published ;
it contains about 150 of Keuleman's finest hand-coloured plates,
all life-size. This book was published at #28, but can be obtained
at about #10 to #12, and is a mine of information regarding the
world's Thrushes.
Blaauw's Monograph of the Cranes is a very scarce book, but is
invaluable to the keeper of these stately birds. It was written by
a very famous aviculturist who was a member of the Avicultural
Society and who died a few years ago. This work is difficult to
obtain and the price, on the rare occasions when it is offered for
sale, is about #8. All the Cranes are illustrated from life and the
plates are hand-coloured.
Two magnificent monographs have been written about the
Birds of Paradise ; these are superbly illustrated, but in a few cases
the artist's imagination has rather run away with him and the
birds are shown displaying their plumes in very unnatural attitudes.
One of these books is by an American author, D. G. Elliot, and the
other by an equally famous English ornithologist, Dr. Sharpe.
Both are quite beyond the purse of the ordinary aviculturist, costing
about #50 apiece, but they can be seen in various large public
libraries. The Zoological Society has one of the finest natural
history libraries in the world and all the books may be seen at any
time by members. It is well worth being a member of the Zoological
Society for the sake of using this magnificent library.

owing to the demand in America for the plates for framing these
books now fetch a fantastic figure. None of them, however, are
of much use to the aviculturist as they are about birds which are
not usually kept in captivity.
The last two monographs to be published are the most useful
from an avicultural point of view, both are by American authors.
These are amongst the finest books published during the present
century. One is Phillip's Monograph of the Ducks ; there is a coloured
plate of every known Duck, excluding domestic ones, and the
subject is treated very exhaustively. The other is Beebe's Monograph
of the Pheasants ; this is a wonderful work and many years were
taken in its preparation. Dr. Beebe is a well known and famous
author and his literary skill makes this book fascinating reading.
The plates, though not in the old hand-coloured style, are very fine.
Unfortunately both these books are very costly, they were
published at #50 apiece, but, for some unknown reason, the price
of the Monograph of the Ducks has soared to about #100, while
that of the " Pheasants " has fallen to about #40. Fortunately
there is a small and condensed edition of the " Pheasants " which
can be purchased for about 50^. ; this contains most of the informa-
tion of the larger edition but lacks most of the purely scientific
matter and some of the plates. It is a book which every Pheasant
lover should possess.
Below is a list of most of the Monographs published in English.

they are not up to the standard of those issued in this country) :--

The Ural Owl is an inhabitant of eastern Europe, and
throughout Russia, as far east as Japan. This species is generally
distributed over the Palaearctic region, but, as its occurrence in
Western Europe is unknown, articles in English are scarce.
They are divided into approximately ten geographical forms,
and Japan, alone, possesses about five races. Very whitish-looking
birds are found in Sakhalin, and occasionally chocolate-black
individuals are found in southern Kiushiu, the locality famous to
aviculturalists as the home of Ijima's Copper Pheasant. In spite
of its large size it is quite common in the wooded hills and country-
sides.
The photograph reproduced here is my pet, Strix uralensis
hondcensis (Clark), taken in the garden when he was about two
years old.
During the summer of 1938 I made a journey with a party of
friends to Kawaguchi, one of the seven most beautiful lakes skirting
Mt. Fuji. The altitude of this lake, I believe, is about 2,000 ft.
Its vegetation is still like the lowland, with tall pine trees and thick
undergrowth woods.
A small boat brought us to an island, situated in the middle
of the lake, where the steep hilltop is covered with tall big trees,
and there one of us spotted a few scattered feathers of Thrushes
and other small birds. We all visualized the scene of tragedy
which had occurred to our little songster--probably an attack
by a Hawk. Suddenly, another member of our party spotted,
not very far from the scene, a big baby Owl sitting on a branch
quietly looking at us, but his wide open eyes clearly showed an
expression of fear and surprise. He looked like a buff-coloured
puff-ball, appearing quite white against the dark forest.
By some mistake he had not got into his nest-hole during the
night. His branch was high up, well beyond our reach, but our
noisy conversation finally made him take to wing. Had it been
evening he could have flown away without much trouble, as his
wing-spread was quite wide, but every time he flew from branch
to branch he lost his height and finally came into our hands.

After all, he was young enough not to realize fear, which he would
have felt if he were a few weeks older, so he soon became accustomed
to the box during our journey and readily ate food from our hands.
Later in the summer I placed him at the entrance hall of my
Japanese villa, near the sea, where he slept happily on a perch.
When I returned late in the evening he would open his eyes wide
with acknowledgment and welcome me by fluttering his wings,
often awakening the entire household. His wing-spread was, by
then, over two and a half feet, and he often put his nails through
the paper screen which separated the hall from the passage.
Having become quite friendly with our dog, a little fox terrier,
I put him on the back of the dog and walked around the garden.
The bird did not mind it at all, but the dog was always opposed
to this form of walk.
I fed him entirely on meat, chiefly a piece of chicken's head,
legs, and such bony parts. Like many other Owls he remembers
his master very well, always begs for food with great enthusiasm,
and would nibble my thumb if he found nothing to eat in my hand.
As he grew very tame, I began to realize the great mistake I had
been making in not training him to eat by himself. It took a couple
of years to train him to eat alone, that is to say, to pick up the food
from the ground and tear it between his powerful bill and toes.
Therefore, for a long time, as I did not like to keep him in a small
space, I turned him loose in a chicken pen where he greatly
enjoyed his life in association with the hens. The chickens
at first objected to his flying about after dark, but soon
both seemed to come to an understanding and lived happily
together, eating different food, and the Owl never once tried
to attack the hens.
When my Owl was about a year old the pen was attacked by
a stray dog which got inside of the Owl's cage. Of course nobody
had seen the scene, but presumably he had fought his enemy
courageously and defended himself. As his nails are very powerful
he could not perch on my arm without wounding my skin, so
probably the dog could not get very near him. About this time he
suffered with bad eye-sight so I realized that his diet was too strong,
as he was not having sufficient exercise. I decided to wash his food
in water, diluting all the blood and fat out of the chicken meat.
In a month or two the filmy appearance over the iris gradually

disappeared, but it took several months before he regained his
*shining eyes, I think the great secret for anyone who keeps Owls,
or other birds of prey, is not to keep their diet too strong, or to
overfeed them. After all, in my opinion, even a big Owl often
does not prey on first quality diet, such as small birds and mice,
as much as they wish to, so they must often be content with a more
inferior kind of diet such as frog, lizard, or even grasshoppers.
It is also very important to leave fur and feathers with the meat
in order to keep the bird's health in perfect condition. Some
kinds of Owls prefer less feathers than others but my Ural Owl
never objected to a large portion on the chicken's head. You
can generally judge the health of the Owl by the quality of its
pellet.
The only voice of our pet I know is his reply to us. I have
never heard his own voice such as we might expect to hear during
the summer moon nights. The Owl is now in his third year and
seems to enjoy his contented life with us, although the pen is a
bit too small for him to hover. I did not have time enough to
train and let him fly outdoors like a Hawk, but I was told a Ural
Owl, if turned out a few hours each day, would soon remember his
master's voice and would fly back when called. But I have never
heard of anyone who has kept this Owl in an absolute free state.
Many readers will agree with me and appreciate that an Owl is
an affectionate companion, the like of which cannot be found

Re your note on page 316, December issue, " Which is the
rarest Parrot you have ever kept? 35 I think in our case, in the
Adelaide Zoo, it is the Ground Parrot {Pezopoms wallacus). I may
state in writing this I am fulfilling a promise made to Major
Alan Lendon, of A.I.F., now on active service with the Australian
Army Medical Corps. In the year 1937 I was in charge of a big
consignment of Australian birds for shipping to a Continental Zoo
and while waiting for the ship I was stationed at the Melbourne
Zoological Gardens for about eight days. I became acquainted
with a Mr. David Fleay, who was at that time in charge of the
Australian section, and who showed me around some of his treasures
among which was a Ground Parrot, the first live specimen I had
ever seen, and thought it the most beautiful bird of the whole of
my bird career, and it was not long before I was pleading to
Mr. Fleay to let me take the bird back to Adelaide. Offer what
exchanges I might the answer was " No ". I wrote off to the late
Mr. R. R. Minchin, Director of the Adelaide Zoo, and told him of
my great discovery and he wrote me saying try and get it, offer
a pair of Princess Alexandras, but no, It was no good. Mr. Fleay
said no, and he meant it. Anyhow later Mr. Minchin offered a
very attractive list of Australian Parrots bred in the Gardens,
and back came the Ground Parrot. What great excitement there
was the t day it arrived and Mr. Minchin handed the box to me,
saying, te Look what is in here 53 ; we looked at the bird over and
over again, and the more we looked the more beautiful was our bar-
gain. We were housing the only Ground Parrot in captivity ; of
the fifty-nine species of Australian Parrots, we had been housing
fifty-three, and this one made fifty-four. It was not until about
twelve months later that we heard of a second one, and we lost
no time in securing it, but unfortunately this bird had crippled
feet and we were doubtful if it would be of any use as a breeder ;

anyhow we were the proud possessors of two live Ground Parrots,
and both looking well. It was at this time that I cut my first
Parrot's wing, being a ground bird and pretty wild at that, it was
no use to run the risk of its dashing against the wire netting. The
more we looked at these two the more we felt sure we had a true
pair. It is always said that Ground Parrots make no call or noise
whatsoever, but the bird with crippled feet has a little soft call
much resembling the Rock Parrot (.Neophema petrophila ), only,
perhaps, just a little softer.
It was not until late in 1940 that our present Director, Mr. V. D.
Haggard, came to me one day with the great news that he had
located still another, a third, bird. He had received advice from
a friend who said he had heard of a man who was scrub rolling about
300 miles from Adelaide when he flushed a green bird in the thick
scrub and it flew against a bough of a tree and hurt its wing. We
made an offer and in about a fortnight back came Ground Parrot
No. 3 in a little padded box and looking as good as bird No. 1,
also eating as well as the others. We think up to the time of
writing that we have the only Ground Parrots in captivity in the
world, and we hope it will not be long before we can breed this
rarity ; one would be most unlucky to have three birds all of
the one sex. I will try and give a short description of its habits,
etc., in captivity and will enclose a couple of feathers for your
inspection, one is a breast feather and the other outer tail. In
colour it is a grass green and marked with black and yellow. Breast
is a greenish yellow with black and green markings, scarlet red bar
on forehead, tail yellow, rather long with black and green markings,
bill horn colour, feet and toes long. It walks very quickly and the
birds we have never perch, although small branches are placed
low down in the cage. They spend most of their time sunning
themselves in the grass that is growing in the cage, even on a very
hot day one will see these birds lying out in the heat with stretched-
out wings. A label has had to be placed in the enclosure reading,
" Look for birds in grass sometimes difficult to see," as one often
hears visitors say, " Can't see anything in here." So one can gather
the birds would be very difficult to see in their wild haunts.
The food given consists of Canary seed, Pannicum seed to which
is added a little Sunflower, hulled oats, and hemp seed. Green
food given is lettuce and thistles or any small seeding grasses.

THE "WING-STRIPE" AS AN INDICATION
OF SEX AND MATURITY IN THE
AUSTRALIAN BROAD-TAILED PARROTS
(Family Platycercida)
By Major Alan Lendon
(Reprinted by kind permission from the South Australian Ornithologist)

Many past workers in Australian ornithology have devoted
much time to the description of subspecies based on minor
differences in size and plumage, while at the same time over-
looking the more obvious plumage differences between the sexes
and between the plumages of maturity and immaturity. Perhaps
the height of absurdity is reached when a rare form is rediscovered
after a lapse of years and promptly dubbed a subspecies, an example
of this being the rediscovery after many years of the Golden-
shouldered Parrakeet ( Psephotus chrysopterygius) . On the other
hand, a glaring example of an obvious sexual difference being
overlooked, was perpetrated by John Gould in his monumental
Birds of Australia when he figured two male Turquoise Parrakeets
(.Neophema p&amp;apos;ulchella) at that time, in his own words, a plentiful
bird, and stated that the sexes were figured and were alike.
In the past it has not been generally realized what a large
contribution scientifically conducted aviculture can make to the
study of plumage variations and it needs to be stressed that
accurate observations of changes in plumage and the times and
ages at which adult plumage is assumed and so on, can only be
ascertained with certainty when birds are kept and bred in
captivity.

A. LENDON-SEX AND MATURITY IN AUSTRALIAN PARROTS 1 75
The Australian members of the order Psittaciformes have
never received due attention from ornithologists, and the writer
will attempt in this essay to draw the attention to an interesting
feature exhibited by a typically Australian family, the Platycercida ,
of which there are found in Australia the six genera, Platycercus ,
Barnardius , Purpureicephalus , Psephotus , Neophema , and Lathamus. In
several species the difference in plumage between male and female
is very marked, e.g. Psephotus dissimilis and Neophema splendida ,
while again in others there is marked dissimilarity between the
plumages of mature and immature forms, e.g. Platycercus elegans
and Purpureicephalus spurius.
On the other hand, in some species the similarity between
plumage of adult male and female is such as to render it difficult
even for the practised eye to distinguish the sexes, e.g. Platycercus
venustus and Neophema petrophila. The same difficulty does not as
a rule occur in distinguishing adults from immatures as even when
the plumages are generally similar the immatures are invariably
duller. Speaking generally, and this applies particularly to those
species where there is not much difference in plumage between
the sexes, the males of this family have a larger, broader, and flatter
head than the females, and the width of the upper mandible is
considerably greater.
There is, however, another feature of the plumage which will
be of great assistance in distinguishing males from females and
adults from immatures, and that is what, for want of a better
name, the writer has designated the " wing-stripe ". This consists
of a series of white spots, variable in size, on the inner webs of some
or most of both primary and secondary flight feathers. If the
stripe is extensive it is generally present on all the flight feathers
with the exception of the outer two or three primaries ; if limited,
it is usually confined to the fourth, fifth, sixth, and sometimes
third or seventh primaries, and it is invariably symmetrical. It is
present to some degree in the great majority of immature Platy-
cercida and tends to be better marked, i.e. more extensive, in
immature females than in immature males.
At the first moult it is almost always lost by the males and
in a great number of cases retained to some degree by the females.
In some species, e.g. Psephotus dissimilis and P. varius, it is invariably
retained by the females, and this appears to be associated with

</footnote>
<bodyText confidence="0.998118948717949" page_id="56239366"  page_num="176" year="" vol="">
marked dissimilarity between the two adult plumages. It is fairly
constantly retained by the adult female in those species where
the dissimilarity, though less obvious, is still pronounced, e.g.
Barnardius barnardi and Purpureicephalus spurius , while it is com-
paratively rarely retained by the female in such species as Platycercus
elegans and Barnardius zonarius where there is little difference between
the adult plumages. To sum up, it would appear that in adult
members of the family Platycercida, i.e. those who have moulted
their flight feathers at least once, if the wing-stripe is present the
bird in question is almost invariably a female, though if absent
it is not necessarily a male. Further, in immatures a marked
wing-stripe is a general indication of the female sex, while a slight
one or its absence strongly suggests that the specimen is a male.
The writer has considered what can be the possible purpose
of such a marking which is only noticeable when a bird in flight
is seen from below. It is generally assumed that all such markings
in birds are in the nature of a warning signal to other members
of the species, and thus it would appear that as warning signals
would be less necessary where the male is much more brightly
coloured and noticeable in flight than the female, e.g. Psephotus
dissimilis, or where the adult is much brighter than the immature,
e.g. Platycercus elegans , so in the cases referred to will the stripe be
lost in the male or adults respectively.
It will now be the writer's task to deal with each species
individually and indicate to what extent the above suppositions
are borne out.
Genus Platycercus. --In this genus immature birds almost
invariably exhibit the wing-stripe to a marked degree, P. venustus
being an occasional exception. The retention of the stripe by the
adult female varies, being generally absent or slight in those
species where the adult plumage differs markedly from the immature,
e.g. P. elegans, P. adelaida , P. flaveolus, and P. caledonicus , and being
markedly retained in those where the immatures are merely duller
editions of the adults, e.g. P. eximius , P. adscitus , and to a lesser
degree P. venustus. In the eighth species, P. icterotis , there is a well-
marked plumage difference between the adult male and female,
and the adult female retains the stripe to a marked degree also.
The plumage of the immature in this species does not differ very
greatly from that of the adult female.

A. LENDON-SEX AND MATURITY IN AUSTRALIAN PARROTS 1 77
P. elegans , Crimson Rosella.--Wing-stripe invariably present
in immatures and tends to be more pronounced in immature
females. The stripe is lost at the first moult by practically all
males and only retained to a slight degree by a few females.
P. adelaida , Adelaide Rosella.--As would be expected in species
so closely related, the same holds good as in the preceding, namely
immatures--invariably present; adults--absent in males and
absent or slight in females.
P. Jiaveolus , Yellow Rosella.--Another closely allied species in
which immatures invariably possess the stripe, but here there
seems to be more tendency for it to be retained to a greater degree
in the adult females than in either of the two preceding species.
In adult males it is absent.
P. caledonicus , Green Rosella.--Here again, invariably present
in immatures, invariably absent in adult males, and, if present,
only to a slight degree in mature females.
P. adscitus, Pale-headed Rosella.--In this species where the
immature plumage is but a duller edition of the adult, the stripe
is still invariably present in the immatures, tending to be more
pronounced in the females. In the adults it is invariably absent
in the males and practically always present to a marked degree
in the females.
P. eximius, Eastern Rosella.--Again the immature plumage is
a dull edition of the adult and wing-stripe is always present, and
more pronounced in the females. In the adults the male loses
the spots at the first moult and the female retains hers to a marked
degree.
P. venustus, Northern Rosella.--Although the immature plumage
once again is but a duller edition of the adult, here one finds that
the wing-stripe is by no means constant in the immatures, even
in the females, and as would be expected it is, therefore, com-
paratively uncommon in the adult females and absent in the
adult males.
P. icterotis , Western Rosella.--In this species the immature
plumage is a somewhat duller edition of that of the adult female
both exhibiting the wing-stripe to a marked degree. The adult
male, although with a very much brighter plumage than that of
the adult female, does exhibit the stripe to some extent in quite
a number of instances.

Genus Barnardius. --In this genus the wing-stripe is not invariably
present in the immatures of some species ; particularly is this so
in the young males. The retention of the stripe by the adult female
is variable also and is particularly marked in B. barnardi , the
species which exhibits the most difference generally between the
plumage of the adult male and female.
B. barnardi, Barnard's Parrakeet.--The wing-stripe here appears
to be present in almost all immatures of both sexes and, as just
stated, to be present in the majority of adult females. It appears
to be absent in adult males.
B. macgillivrayi, Cloncurry Parrakeet.--The writer has not had
the opportunity of examining many specimens of this species, but
the available material suggests a close correspondence with the
preceding species in that immatures exhibit the stripe and that
it is retained to some degree in most adult females.
B. zonarius , Port Lincoln Parrakeet.--In this species the stripe
is by no means constant in immatures ; in fact, the majority of
immature males show a complete absence, although it is present
in all immature females. Adult males, as would be expected, do
not exhibit it and only a small proportion of adult females appear
to retain it.
B. semitorquatus, Twenty-eight Parrakeet.--As would be expected
in a species so closely allied to the preceding, there is close corre-
spondence in the presence or absence of the stripe, but there
appears to be a tendency for it to be more constantly present in
immatures of both sexes and for a larger proportion of adult females
to retain it than in the case of the preceding species.
Genus Purpureicephalus. P. spurius , Red-capped Parrakeet.--As
would be expected in this species where the immature plumage
differs so markedly from that of the adult, the wing-stripe in the
immatures is constant. Again, as the adult female is considerably
duller than the adult male, so there is the corresponding practically
invariable retention of the stripe in the female and its loss in the
male at the first moult.
Genus Psephotus .--It will be convenient to consider the members
of this genus by regarding them as constituting three subgenera :--
Subgenus Psephotus. --In this subgenus the marked difference
in plumage between the adult male and adult female is quite
apparent, though to a slightly lesser extent in the immatures.

A. LENDON-SEX AND MATURITY IN AUSTRALIAN PARROTS 1 79
P. varius , Many-coloured Parrakeet.--Immatures of both
sexes, although immediately differentiated by the brighter plumage
of the males, exhibit a marked wing-stripe. This is invariably
retained by the adult female and equally invariably lost by the
adult male.
P. hamatonotus, Red-rumped Parrakeet.--Exactly the same
holds good as in the preceding species, namely immatures of both
sexes exhibit the stripe, adult females always retain it and adult
males never do so.
Subgenus JVorthiella .--In this subgenus there is not the marked
difference in plumage between adult males and females and the
immatures are merely duller editions of the adult.
JV. hamatogaster , Blue Bonnet.--In this species the stripe is
fairly constant in immatures with a tendency for it to be less
Wing of Female Psephotus varius from below to show " Wing-stripe "
marked in males. Adult males seldom exhibit any trace of a
stripe, while a fairly large proportion of adult females retain some
trace thereof.
JV. narethte, Little Blue Bonnet.--In this species the stripe
appears to be almost invariable in the immatures and, as would
be expected, corresponding with the more obvious plumage
differences between the adult male and female, compared with
the preceding species, so the stripe disappears in the male and
is retained in the female.
Subgenus Psephotellus. --Here again there is a very marked
difference between the adult plumage and correspondence with
changes in the stripe.

<bodyText confidence="0.987552384615385" page_id="56239370"  page_num="180" year="" vol="">
P. dissimilis , Hooded Parrakeet.--The stripe is invariably
present to a marked degree in the immatures in which there are
no very obvious sexual differences. It is retained to an equally
marked degree in all adult females and is completely lost in all
adult males.
P. chrysopterygius , Golden-shouldered Parrakeet.--In such a
closely related species one would expect absolute correspondence
with what occurs in P. dissimilis and, although the writer has
not seen any living specimens, the few skins examined bear out
this conclusion.
P. pulcherrimus, Paradise Parrakeet.--Although not quite so
nearly related as the preceding two species are to one another,
yet it is sufficiently close to assume a similar presence or absence
of stripe, and again the few skins available support this.
Genus JVeophema. --In this genus, the wing-stripe is so variable
that it is impossible to make any generalization, and it is best to
consider each species individually.
JV. bourki, Bourke's Parrakeet.--In the immatures the stripe
is a certain guide to sex, being absent or slight in immature males
and well marked in immature females. In adults, as would be
expected from the foregoing, it is absent in males and practically
invariably well-marked in females.
JV. chrysostoma , Blue-winged Parrakeet.--In the immatures, the
stripe is generally, though not invariably, present ; if absent,
the bird is almost certainly a male. In adult males it is always
lost, but adult females are variable, quite a large number showing
some evidence of it.
JV. elegans, Elegant Parrakeet.--Very inconstant in immatures
and when present to any extent it is an indication of the female
sex. In adults it is absent in males and it is quite unusual for it
to be retained to any marked degree, if at all, in females.
JV. petrophila , Rock Parrakeet.--Fairly constantly present in
immatures and tending to be more marked in females. In adults
occasional evidence appears to persist in males and there is fairly
constant, though usually quite slight, evidence in adult females.
JV. chrysogaster , Orange-bellied Parrakeet.--In the few specimens
handled there appears to be a fairly constant presence in immatures
with complete absence in mature males and variability in adult
females.

A. LENDON--SEX AND MATURITY IN AUSTRALIAN PARROTS 181
N. pulchella , Turquoisine Parrakeet.--Immatures of both sexes
show a practically constant and well-marked stripe which is
invariably lost in adult males and almost invariably retained to
a marked degree in adult females.
JV. splendida, Scarlet-chested Parrakeet.--The immatures are
very variable, some, which appear to be invariably females,
exhibiting a marked stripe while in others of both sexes it is absent.
Correspondingly it is invariably absent in the adult male and quite
inconstant in the adult female, being usually either well marked
or entirely absent.
Genus Lathamus. L. discolor , Swift Parrakeet.--This strange
honey-feeding Parrot reveals its platycercine affinity by the presence
of a wing-stripe as well as in other ways. The stripe appears to
be present in all immatures and rather inconstant in adults of
both sexes, being retained in some males and lost in some females.
Acknowledgments : The writer has to acknowledge his indebted-
ness to the authorities of the South Australian Museum for permission
to examine their collection of skins of the family under review.
The remainder of the conclusions have been based largely on
observations of living specimens in the writer's aviaries where
twenty-five of the twenty-eight species considered are represented
by true pairs, the three missing species being Psephotus chrysopterygius ,
P. pule her rimus, and Neophema chrysogaster ; and where during the
past four years twelve species have successfully hatched and reared
their young and their plumage changes have been accurately
recorded until they have reached maturity. Of the species which
the writer has not succeeded in persuading to breed to date, a
further nine have been successfully reared either in the Adelaide
Zoological Gardens or in the aviaries of fellow aviculturists and
the writer is indebted to them for the opportunity of examining
the young birds at frequent intervals until they reached maturity.

There are plenty of records of the breeding of this Macaw
dating from a hundred years ago to now. I give here all I know.
The earliest is in Lauder and Brown's Parrot volume of the
Miscellany of Nat. History published in 1833. Here (p. fj) we read :
" We have an interesting and detailed account of various broods
of a pair of Blue Macaws (Psittacus ararauna ) which bred at Caen
in France, from the pen of M. Lamoureux, Professor of Natural
History in that town. These birds, the property of M. Eshault
of Caen, commenced incubation in March, 1818, and up to August,
1822, they had 9 broods, and the female laid during that period
62 eggs. Of these 25 were productive and ten only of the young
birds died ; the others lived, throve remarkably well and seemed
quite naturalized to the climate." Both Butler (ii, 152) and
Neunzig {p. 6yg) mention this event, the latter adding the detail,
"in a cage " and recording another success in Germany with the
reference Die Gef. Welt , 1301, 303 ; in this case a pair belonging to
Herr Sharland laid in a cupboard in a room and hatched out one
young bird, which left the nest at 94 days old. In a more recent
Gefiederte Welt , i.e. 1332, p. no , M. Muller describes success in the
previous year in a large flying aviary at Essen, Germany, and gives
photos of the single young bird hatched at various ages from seven
to twelve weeks old. It was hatched on 5th October and was
over four months old when the article was written. A summary
of the account appeared in A.M., 1332, 226.
As regards the U.K., Seth-Smith ( A.M ., 1333, 411) says that it
was bred in the Edinburgh Zoo in 1939 ; two young were hatched
in August, which were still alive in November, and I believe still are.
This Macaw was also bred successfully in West Australia by
Mr. Padbury from 1926 onwards ; when I saw them in 1932

" Has been bred with success in a flight-cage " says Neunzig

to Dr. Frenzel " bred " one young one, but it only survived a few
days, which (if correct) distinctly upsets the record. Our Zoo bred

was two months old at the time of writing, but still could not walk

GREEN CONURE (No. 358), A. leucophthalma {Muller).
According to Russ it was bred (Abroad) by Gabriac, but
Neunzig does not mention this and Lauder and Brown in their
PARROT volume of the Miscellany of Natural History {1833) say
under " Peacock Parrot, Psittacus guyanensis " (which = this
species) that M. de Gabriac only got as far as young birds, which
were not reared ; this would indicate that this record cannot
stand, unless Russ had further information from some other source.
Anyhow the species was bred in Australia recently, at the Adelaide
Zoo in 1936, when one youngster was reared. See A.M., 1337,

CAROLINA CONURE (No. 363), Conuropsis carolinensis
{Linn.).
Russ was the first breeder teste Russ. On his success Neunzig
(p. 663) writes : "A pair in Dr. Russ's bird-room hatched out
three young and later on five more. Three to five eggs were laid ;
both parents sat and fed ; nest-down mouse-grey. The young
were the same size as the adults, but ... a lighter green, . . . not
till the second year was the yellow or orange of the head fully
developed."
They have also been bred in America and are included in
Beebe and Crandall's List of Birds bred in the U.S.A., which
appeared in the JV.T. #ool. Soc. Bulletin , igog, 381, where we learn
that one success was in 1885 (9th Sept.), when a young Carolina
Conure was hatched by a Turtledove at the Philadelphia Zoo
after an incubation period of 14 days, but we are not told how
long the young bird lived nor indeed whether the egg had been
laid by captive birds or taken from a wild nest. This Conure does
not appear to have ever been bred in this country, but Butler
(ii, 161) says " has been freely bred in Germany ". See also
Nowatny in the Auk, i8gg, 28-38 , and Salvadori's foot-note in

captivity of this extinct (or almost extinct) Parrakeet.
WHITE-EARED CONURE (No. 365), Pyrrhura leucotis (Kuhl.).
Butler (ii, 163) says that this Conure was bred in London in
1885 an d quotes Russ to the effect that they were also bred in
Vienna in 1889 by Prince Frederick of Saxe-Gotha. Brooks reared
seven young in Scotland in 1906 and was awarded the A.S. Medal

in spite of the earlier record given by Butler (. A.M ., igoy , 5g, no).
Neunzig says " once bred " and M. Decoux told me that L'Abbe
Leray had bred them often. Neunzig {p. 661 ) says that hybrids
with the RED-BELLIED GONURE have been obtained, but does
not definitely say which way.
RED-BELLIED GONURE (Nos. 366, 367), P. frontalis ( V).
{vittata, Shaw ; not Bodd). (P. f. frontalis and P. f chiripepe {V) =
subspecies.)
Bred by Mme Lecallier in France in 1918 teste Decoux in
A.M. , igsy, 140 , where the name luciani was used, but Delacour
told me that the birds bred by this lady and elsewhere in France
in the same year were " all vittata " (= frontalis ), and that luciani
had only been imported very rarely, and one of these rare occasions
was a true Lucian's Conure, which he himself had once possessed.
Shore-Baily reared one young #C chiripepe " in 1923 ( A.M .,
igsg, 20f) and four young " vittata " in 1934 ( A.M ., ig2g, 13 /).
As the parents were the same pair, the young were the same species,
i.e. almost certainly frontalis. --E. H.
Hybrids with the WHITE-EARED CONURE (? which way)
are also on record.
RED-EARED GONURE, P. cruentata {Max).
Bred by Whitley in 1937, three young being reared which
I saw in October three months old, and they were still alive in
1938. Success never recorded by the breeder.

Blue-masked Lovebirds
In reference to the Blue-masked Lovebirds mentioned on p. 90, Mr. Rudkin
writes in July, 1941, to tell me that this blue variation is now well established in
California ; he had thirty of his own breeding at that date and had disposed
of a number of others. I have no news of what has happened to those bred so
successfully by Mr. Whitley, and hope that this perhaps may elicit some
information.

While I am sure that every member of the Society will greatly appreciate
the kind gesture of our overseas friends in offering to take some of our rarer birds
for the duration of the war, I think few, perhaps, realize the almost insurmountable
difficulties which would occur in connection with the shipping of the birds.
Voyages now take, in some cases, three and four times as long as they did
previously and for that reason it would be a very difficult matter to procure the
requisite amount of food for that period. It is also very difficult to make any
arrangements with individuals on the ships to look after the birds for, besides
the men having so much more to do these days, few if any would care to take on
extra duty in looking after the birds.
Owing to the fact that one is only given a few hours' notice from the shipping
companies before the ship sails, and also that one is not allowed to know by what
ship or from what port the cargo sails until the day of sailing, one may have to
keep the birds in their travelling cages for perhaps several weeks before the
actual dispatch. For this reason it is very difficult to make contact with any of
the ship's personnel to give instructions regarding the feeding and care of the birds.
Livestock is a very different proposition to ordinary merchandise and only those
who have to send the latter overseas these days know the great difficulties one has
to contend with. I rather doubt whether any shipping company would accept
livestock now or if one could get permission to send it abroad. Judging by the
slow motion working of Government bureaux, the war would be over by the time
one did get permission.
I don't think the danger from bombing is half as great as the hazards by sea.
Our great difficulty is food and far more birds have died from the lack of proper
food than by bombing. If only some of our overseas friends could manage to get
some small consignments of food sent, that would go a long way to saving our birds.

Having read Prebendary Sweetnam's article in this month's magazine I feel
it is up to me to offer to house a few birds over here for the duration--not seed
eaters. The birds I have got here and who seem to stand our winter well are
Forster's Lorikeets and if any member has any which they would care to have
housed and fed for the duration I will gladly do it. Mine live on bread and milk
and fruit when we can get it and they are in a large enough aviary to have two
or three more pairs. The arrangement must, of course, be that I return them
(or what is then alive) after the war. Here milk is easy, and I think I can safely
say I could take anything ready to live on bread and milk. As to getting them here
I can usually find an escort from London if given time. I don't know whether this
offer is worth anything to any one but if it is I am only too glad to make it.

I should like to express my appreciation of the splendid July-August number
of the Magazine. It is a real achievement under present extremely difficult
conditions. It is also a matter of great consolation still to be able to read articles
by Mr. Delacour. There is one very paradoxical aspect of the food question
which I should like to point out. On account of restrictions, thousands of rare
and valuable birds, and millions of poultry will have to be killed off, although
several thousands of useless greyhounds, kept solely for betting purposes, are being
kept in training. This is a strange anomaly, which no member of the Govern-
ment has endeavoured to explain. I have two empty aviaries suitable for Pheasants
should any member care to entrust me with the care of them for the duration
of the war.

THE SPOTTED TANAGER
(Calospiza guttata chrysophrys)
By J. Delacour
Few genera of birds are more brilliant than the Tanagers of

the genus known as Tatigara, Calospiza or Calliste, and generally
known to aviculturists as Callistes. The marvellous colour of
practically all its members, and they are numerous, is enhanced
by the glossy and silky appearances of their feathers. However,
as their shape is that of a graceful, but very normal Finch, nothing
in them comes to distract the eye from their gorgeous, but always
harmonious, plumage.
The lovely Superb, Tricolor, Blue-headed, to mention only a
few species, are familiar to all bird lovers ; their varied and bright
hues of blue, green, yellow and red are very striking. If not so
showy, other Callistes are nevertheless excessively pretty and the
Spotted Tanager, represented on the adjoining plate, is a very
handsome and interesting one. This species is widespread and
ranges from Trinidad, west to Colombia, and north to Costa Rica,
with several weakly marked geographical races, negligible as far
as aviculture goes. Slightly different species {punctata, varia ,
xanthogastra) , with a few sub-species, are found in the Guianas,
Amazonia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The birds usually
imported are the Venezuelan {guttata-chrysophrys) , and the
Panamanian {eusticta) forms.
I have seen the Spotted Tanager in the wild state in Northern
Venezuela. It is fairly common there in the woods, or the moun-
tains, especially in gullies where little flocks are found on trees

and bushes, often in company with other Callistes and sugar-
birds, looking for berries and hunting small insects.
In captivity, Spotted Tanagers usually prove to be good livers.
They are rather more insectivorous than other Callistes, although
fruit is the basis of their diet. At different times I brought over
and kept several, and they were more satisfactory than many other
Callistes, which require a great deal of care if they are to thrive in
captivity for a long time.

THE BREEDING OF INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS

Our dauntless Editor has promised us a number devoted to
softbills and has asked me for an account of my successes and
failures. After due consideration I have decided to omit a number
of the latter as they might have a deterrent effect on budding
aviculturists with a leaning to this class of birds.
There can be no doubt that of all our birds the softbills are the
tamest and most intelligent, exception being perhaps made for
a few of the Parrots. No one will deny that the group under con-
sideration contains the most beautiful and graceful of all the birds
known to our aviaries. As instances, one should perhaps begin
with some of the larger species, such as the Occipital Blue Pie,
the Azure-winged Magpie, and the Birds of Paradise, then come
my favourites, members of the large family of Turdidae which
includes of course the true Thrushes, the Robins, Ghats, Redstarts,
etc. I had almost forgotten the numerous species of Glossy Starlings,
with their marvellous iridescent plumage, and what bird is more
striking than the Royal Starling with its wonderful combination
of canary yellow and purple, added to which, unlike most Starlings,
he has a grace of movement and outline which reminds one of the
Yellow Wagtail. Finally we have those feathered jewels the Sun-
birds, Sugar Birds, and the Fruitsuckers (Chlorcpsis ).
I have no experience of Humming Birds whose upkeep is so
artificial and precarious that I think it will be many years before
a breeding success will be recorded.

From the preceding remark it will, I fear, be deduced truthfully
that I have not much use for any bird whose breeding is almost,
if not quite, impossible, though I must admit that I have before
now attempted the impossible, and that naturally I have failed.
At the risk of labouring the comparison between&amp;apos; softbills and
seed-eaters, can anyone name one of the latter dressed in plain
browns and buffs and black, which can vie with the beauty of the
common Song Thrush, the Long-tailed Tit, the Pied Wagtail, or
the little Jenny Wren ?
Lastly, when one has considered such points as grace, coloura-
tion, intelligence, and tameness, there remains one outstanding
quality, that of song, and there is no question that for some reason
the softbills more than hold their own, though it must be admitted
that many of the Grow family, such as Jays and Birds of Paradise,
have a raucous vocabulary which makes them tiresome, not only
to neighbours but to their owners also.
I see from my very rough notes that since 1909, when I started
aviculture seriously, over twenty of the species of softbills which
I have owned have either reared young or have attempted to do so.
My first adventure into the realm of insectivorous birds was the
purchase of that jolly little fellow, the Red-whiskered Bulbul
[Otoe amps a jocosa ), in 1910, and shortly afterwards I bought another,
and although there was no outward difference these birds proved
to be a true pair and quickly built a nest in a Canary travelling
cage. They were so pugnacious, however, that I had to transfer
them to other aviaries on two occasions before peace was declared
with their fellow-occupants. To cut a long story short these birds
had two nests of three and four eggs respectively, and although
several young were hatched only one was fully reared from each
nest. I was only just beaten on the tape for a first-time success by
that doyen of aviculturists, Mr. W. E. Teschemaker.
Older members of the Society will remember this gentleman
as the most successful breeder of those days, who " lifted 55 far more
medals than any of his contemporaries.
My next success was a failure, if I may be allowed an Irishism.
I had bought from the late J. D. Hamlyn a " pair 35 of Golden-
fronted Fruitsuckers (Chloropsis aurifrons ), one of which, the hen,
was in a terrible state of dirt and featherlessness. I only paid 2s. 6 d.
for this bird, whose life I hoped I might save. By dint of clean

conditions, an old shaving-brush, and soapsuds I soon had the
bird in good feather, when she proved to be Jerdon's Fruitsucker
(C. jerdonii ). My breeding was thus deferred for a year when
I obtained what I thought was a true hen of Chloropsis aurifrons.
The introduction of this bird to the old cock was not encouraging,
for both birds began to sing, and quite a lot of chasing and bickering
took place. This state of affairs gradually subsided ; before long
I noticed both birds carrying bits of hay, and although this went on
for some time no progress was made beyond the placing of a few
bents in a privet bush. The books tell us that this species uses
spiders' webs in the construction of their nests. I had no difficulty
in finding a quantity of this material, but it was not looked at.
Finally I fixed an old Thrush nest in the favoured spot in the
privet, and very shortly afterwards found a few coco-nut fibres
neatly laid in the nest. The next day an egg was laid, and the
following day another. My experience proved that the usual
clutch is only two. The egg was what might be described as stone-
coloured with a few reddish brown spots at the thicker end.
Incubation was from thirteen to fourteen days, and was entirely
performed by the hen, moreover she took over the whole of the
feeding on this occasion, but the one chick hatched only lived about
twelve hours.
Two more attempts were made, on the second of which the only
chick lasted for forty-eight hours, but on the third we nearly
succeeded, the youngster being reared to the age of twelve days
when I found him dead on the aviary floor some way from the nest.
He had a small wound on the scalp and I rather suspect the cock
to have been the culprit. The attempted breeding of these birds
must be a very rare event, in fact the only other case I know of
occurred in the late Dr. Lovell Keay's aviaries, where a nest was
built. The commissariat of Fruitsuckers with young was somewhat
difficult to cater for. They refused fruit and nectar mixtures for
their young, and as they were extremely tame I was able to watch
the feeding process at close range. In the second and third nests
the cock did help with the feeding, a little pure undiluted honey
was used, a few fresh ants' eggs, and very young cockroaches, but,
as is usual, mealworms were the favourite items. These were
chewed up for a long time, after which the case was thrown aside,
the juices, having been completely extracted, were then fed to the

young. The twelve-day-old youngster which I somewhat senti-
mentally preserved in spirit till a year or so ago, clearly showed
his parentage, the wing quills were just bursting, showing the
typical green colour, the bill was slender and curved, but much
less so than is the case in adult birds. I had often promised myself
that I would make a fourth and successful attempt to breed these
Fruitsuckers, but the mixing of special food for a single pair of
nectar feeders has somewhat deterred me. I now notice that
most bird-keepers feed these birds on the ordinary softbill mixture,
they seem to thrive on this, but I cannot think that it can be so
natural to this type of birds as the old honey and condensed milk
mixture.
Mrs. Wharton-Tigar, by the way, owned until recently a very
fine pair of Chloropsis , the Javan, I believe, and these birds
attempted to breed on at least one occasion, but no eggs were laid ;
indeed I do not know whether they got as far as a complete nest.
An attractive and beautiful genus, but extremely combative : two
of a sex will fight to the death, and even among true pairs I have
known murder when the breeding season was over. This is
undoubtedly one of the class of bird where it would be safer to
cage up the male within sight of the female if and when young are
hatched.
As these notes are becoming alarmingly lengthy, it will suffice
to give very brief accounts of birds bred in my aviaries, more
especially as these successes and failures have already been recorded
in the Magazine.
Blue-tits (Pams cceruleus) reared one nest in a mixed aviary
containing Waxbills and other small inoffensive Finches. They
did not bear out the statement often made of the Paridae that they
are of a murderous disposition. I have no record of these little
birds having bred elsewhere ; they are easy to cater for and very
beautiful. I often think what a sensation they would produce
were they exotics imported for the first time.
The Great-tit (Parus major) earned me one of my first medals,
oddly enough they were extremely wild when first trapped and
put into a small aviary by themselves. They went to nest none the
less, and brought off six young, which I liberated as soon as they
were independent. A second clutch was soon forthcoming, and on
this occasion I gave the birds their liberty as soon as the young

were hatched, and from having been so wild they became pesteringly
tame, took mealworms from my hand, came into the house during
meals, and helped themselves to what they wanted. Unlike the
Blue-tit the Great-tit is a born murderer.
I have kept several species of foreign Tits, both Indian and
American, none was long-lived, and all seemed to require large
quantities of niger seed, otherwise they died almost immediately.
The Blue-winged Siva {Siva cyanuroptera ) in many ways is very
Tit-like in its behaviour and in its love of a scrap. They are almost
impossible to sex, and of several pairs I have kept only once have
I reared them to leave the nest.
The following lists include species with which I have had partial
success only.

The attempted breeding of the Malachite Sunbirds perhaps
deserves some amplification. The birds were given one end of a
greenhouse which I had wired off, and planted with a honeysuckle
{Lonicerus hildebrandtii ) and a jessamine ( Jazoricum ). Both of these
plants flowered freely, but were almost overlooked in favour of
the nectar provided in the feeders. Here again is a species much
given to fighting, and marital squabbles are the rule. None the less
a nest was built in the jessamine, one egg was laid, and a chick
hatched. Both parents did a lot of hawking for flying insects, but
these are not numerous inside a greenhouse. Mealworms were
not favouied, but I got a certain amount of food with a sweeping
net worked through meadow grass. This was hard labour, and had
to cease when I had an epidemic in my practice which left me no
spare time for such exercise. The young Sunbird promptly died,

he was then four or five days old, and the male added to my sorrow
and disappointment by immediately killing his hen.
It will be seen that I failed both with the Blue-headed Rock
Thrush and with the Chestnut-breasted Rock Thrush. These Rock
Thrushes, though easily sexed, are most difficult to deal with on
account of the males' murderous proclivities. The cock Blue-headed
killed no less than four hens, the last of which he did allow to build
a nest and lay a few eggs before dispatching her. Though this is
one of the most beautiful of this section of Thrushes I was so annoyed
with him that I presented him to the Zoo in 1930, where thousands
of people must have seen him since he was certainly still living
when last I visited the Small Bird House in 1939. He was an adult
bird when he first came to me, and I had him about four years,
which makes his age at least fourteen years. Thus do the wicked
flourish !
A cheery little fellow is the Hermit Thrush ( Hylocichla guttata)
with his charming little tinkling song. He much resembles our
Song Thrush on a very small scale, but belongs to a separate genus.
I had no trouble in breeding this species apart from sexing the birds.
When male and female are identical one has to rely on the principle
of trial and error. The Hermit Thrushes were quite inoffensive
towards all the little seed-eaters sharing their aviary, indeed this
might be said of almost all softbills, excepting the Crows, of course,
but I have yet to find two species of softbill which will breed in
the same aviary unless it be a very large one. The breeding of the
Hermit was a " first timer
Ever since I read the late Mr. Astley's book, My Birds in Freedom
and Captivity , I have shared with him a great love for the Blue Rock
Thrush ( Monticola solitaria) though none of mine ever regaled me
with the song one often reads about. These birds are seldom on
the British market, chiefly, I think, because they are highly valued
in Southern Europe where most of them are caught. During a
plant-hunting visit to the Maritime Alps and Northern Italy I saw
the bird in its wild state and also in cages, but the price asked,
whether in francs or lira was always exhorbitant, and I refused
to be " done Finally when leaving my hotel for my journey
home I saw several bulky cages wrapped up in canvas, and was
told they contained " passer as ", the price, now that I was definitely
leaving, was quite reasonable, and I purchased a pair. These

birds were in a divided cage obviously made for travel, it was dark,
but I could see that both birds were bright-eyed and lively, which
was good enough for me. On my way home I broke my journey
at Cleres, and M. Delacour kindly allowed me the use of two
cages wherein the birds might have a little exercise, a bath, and so
on. I immediately discovered that the hen of my " pair " was a
Pied Rock Thrush (Monticola saxatilis ), also a most delightful
species which I have since possessed, but not what I wanted.
By great good luck M. Delacour wanted this bird and was able
to give me a hen Blue Rock Thrush in exchange. I was a happy
man when I got back to Eton, and had not the usual " end of the
holidays " feeling, for I had at last got a pair of a species I had
coveted for years. In addition, I had a very fine collection of alpine
plants collected during that holiday which, after a long period of
years, are still flourishing with me, though the birds, alas, are no
more. They did, none the less, after much fighting and many
temporary separations, build, lay, and hatch four young of which
one, the first Blue Rock Thrush to be bred in England, lived for
many years in the possession of Mrs. Astley, to whom I gave him.
This bird, which was kept in a cage, proved to be a very fine singer,
though he never obliged on the occasion of my visits.
Another love of mine, with which I have had less luck, is also
a European migrant, that perfect gem, the Arctic Blue-throat
(.Luscinia cyanecula). Dr. Armand, at one time a well-known French
aviculturist living in Paris, usually had several of this species
and kept them for a number of years. Another successful bird
keeper, M. Plocq, also a Frenchman, not only kept this bird without
much difficulty, but actually caught his own birds on the southern
migration. If you are not familiar with this little beauty, picture to
yourself a diminutive and lively Robin Redbreast. The abdomen
is greyish-white, the back rufous brown, and the throat has a patch
of azure blue with a white spot in the centre. In the female there
is only a small blue patch without the white spot. There is another
species with a red patch which takes the place of the blue. They
have the great intelligent eye of the Robin tribe, and were it not for
the great difficulty of wintering them they would rank high among
the most desirable of softbills. I once kept a true pair for some
nine months, and the hen got as far as placing a few fibres in a
faggot of sticks, but like so many of the more delicate softbills her

flight feathers were none too good, and one cannot expect much
from a bird which cannot fly strongly.
The same trouble has been my undoing with the Niltavas, of
which I have had pairs of the Greater (JV. grandis), the Rufous
bellied (N. sundara ), and the Lesser (JV. macgrigoria). The first
two of these went as far as building, but no further. Here again
we have birds whose portrayal requires the pen of a poet and the
brush of a very skilled artist.
Of the true Thrushes the only species I can remember to have
bred is the Migratory Thrush (T. migratorius ), often spoken of as
the American Robin, which title ought really to have been given
to the Bluebird. These Thrushes are quite easily bred, the parents
being quite satisfied with a plentiful supply of earthworms, small
at first, but later on the larger the better.
The late Mr. H. D. Astley was one of the first to breed the
Migratory Thrush in his aviaries. Later he put the eggs in the nest
of wild Blackbirds, these were hatched and reared, but I believe
the young strayed away and were not seen for long. Probably
their migratory instincts were the cause of their departure. The
male Migratory Thrush is a handsome fellow, very hardy, with a
song which somewhat resembles the Blackbirds', but is less beautiful
than this bird's performance.
A very old favourite of mine is the Orange-headed Ground
Thrush (Geocichla citrina ), a species which for very many years
I have seldom been without. Again a very easy species to breed,
and quite definitely double-clutched. I have had pairs which were
late starters, notwithstanding which they have laid their second
clutch as late as September, with successful results. Individual
pairs vary a good deal. In some cases the birds can be kept together
the whole year round, in others one or other, usually the male,
keeps the other away from the feeding pans, and if starvation will
not do the trick, well, there are other and quicker methods.
Shamas and Bluebirds shall end my recital of the Thrush tribe
which I have kept in my time.
Of the Shama much has been written, and I suppose it must be
conceded that it is the most popular of cage birds. It has a rousing
and cheerful song, and a wild or timid Shama is a thing I have
never seen. Moreover some of the hens sing almost as well as the
cocks. So fearless are they that one has to be careful not to walk

out of one's aviary with a Shama perched on one's hat or shoulder.
Given any sort of rough box they will almost always build, lay,
and hatch out young, but considering the very large numbers of
these birds kept in captivity, very few young are reared during
a season. I must have had more than a dozen pairs of these birds
and have only once reared one to maturity, something has always
happened, either the hen has died or the young have flown straight
into the bath and met a watery death, and in the early days before
I learned wisdom the cock often took the young out of the nest for
a fly round the aviary and forgot to put them back. The remedy,
as is now well known, is to cage up the male when the young are
three or four days old. I am quite sure that they could be bred
quite easily if given semi-liberty when the young are hatched,
but as I have always had Bluebirds flying loose during the breeding
season this has not been possible for me as these two species are
not good " mixers ".
I have written so much in this Magazine on the subject of
Bluebirds or, as they are more commonly called, Blue Robins,
that I hesitate to add much to my previous notes. My first pair
came to me in 1926, from these I managed to rear fully one young
male, although many more were reared to leave the nest the first
season. These died of neglect shortly after. Had they been caged
up with their parents after leaving the nest, they would almost
certainly have lived. From the old pair, the young cock and a hen
which was later given to me, I reared over sixty Bluebirds in the
course of eight or nine years. My record, although it ended in
disaster, was twelve independent young from one pair, all of which
died in the autumn from enteritis. Quite suddenly they all seemed
to take a dislike to their ordinary soft food so I gave them an
unlimited quantity of mealworms, a handful at a time three or
four times a day. Whether this lack of appetite for their usual food
was a precursor of the disease, or whether it was actually produced
by a surfeit of mealworms, it is difficult to say, but I have ever
since greatly reduced the ration of that indispensable insect as soon
as the youngsters were on their own. Although others, more capable
than myself, manage to breed Bluebirds in captivity, all that
I have bred, with the exception of the young male just mentioned,
have been reared either by wild Redbreasts or by their own parents
at liberty. This procedure appears risky, but I have had extra-

ordinarily few losses by parents straying or losing their way.
Granted that at first you may have a mauvais quart d'hoeur, which
may even last an hour or two, the parents always seem to know
their way back in the end. After this all usually goes smoothly.
Further, the lesson once learned the sense of orientation persists,
and the following season one has no qualms in liberating the
parents, providing they are in the same aviary.
My knowledge and experience of Grows are not large, but my
first venture in the realms of aviculture, apart from Jackdaws and
Magpies kept as a boy, was the importation of four young Ravens
from Scotland. They arrived in a large box, together with a whole
rabbit which they were much too young to deal with. The din
they made when I first liberated them can better be imagined
than described, and I had to stuff them with whatever food I could
find in the larder to prevent complaints from my neighbours.
Unfortunately they learned that any serious clamour would bring me
rushing out to appease and quieten them, and I was much relieved
when they learned to be independent of me and became less noisy.
As I only had a large dog-kennel in which to keep these birds I soon
got rid of two, and the remaining pair, with clipped wings, were
often given their liberty in my garden. They were the most
destructive brutes I have ever known, a large clump of some such
tough plant as an iris or Michaelmas daisy was destroyed in no
time, neither were they very safe with dogs, especially if these were
asleep. Finally I built them an aviary, but was never really attracted
by them so parted with them and used the aviary for smaller birds,
got badly bitten by the cult, and joined the Avicultural Society.
One of my Ravens was given to an Eton master with a house
of boys. This bird was very noisy, and annoyed the boys, so one of
them was deputed to poison the culprit. When I inquired of this
boy what he had tried, as the poison had no effect, his answer was,
" Two vegetable laxatives, sir ! 55
As my aviaries increased in number I again had a hankering
for members of the Grow tribe, and my next venture was a pair of
Azure-winged Magpies, the species which Mr. Sydney Porter has
recently so successfully bred. My birds proved to be a true pair
and went to nest their second season, and two young were reared.
Their aviary, which naturally they had to themselves, was a small
affair, some 12 to 14 feet long and only 3 feet deep.

A few years later this same small aviary was given to a pair of
Occipital Blue Pies. These birds built two nests at the same time,
but of course only used one. Several clutches of eggs were laid
and a good many young hatched and eaten by their parents at
various ages. Towards the end of the season the urge to build and
lay again became less, and two young were fully reared, though
only one survived. Had I kept the parents another season I should
certainly have hand-reared one or two, for it would have been
delightful to have a really tame Blue Pie flying round the garden
as one can so easily do with a Jackdaw, or the more nearly allied
common Magpie.
My experience with these two species of Pie taught me that
there is a strong tendency to eat the young, and that an abundance
of meaty food must be supplied. In the early days, an unlimited
supply of mealworms and clean gentles, also cockroaches if you can
get them ; later on one must get busy with mouse-traps if these
pests are at all plentiful. A Sparrow-trap during the summer will
produce countless young Sparrows, but no adults will be caught
at that season. They are too wary when breeding. The humane
trapper need therefore have no qualms about young nestlings being
left to starve.
Writing of Sparrow-traps reminds me of a somewhat shattering
experience I once had. I was taking a very sweet old lady round
my garden. Incidentally she was a great lover and tamer of wild
birds. Suddenly, to my horror, I heard the fluttering made by
numbers of trapped Sparrows. Frantically I whispered to my wife
to hide the trap. This was done and I breathed again. What was
my surprise to get a letter from this lady asking me if I could tell
her where to get a Sparrow-trap, as these birds were so destructive
to her flowers, and also disturbed her pet Robins, Tits, etc. !
I often wonder whether the old dear was sharper than I thought,
and had spotted my subterfuge.
Should these notes persuade any reader to give up his
Budgerigars, Waxbills, or Finches in favour of softbills, my advice
is " Don't ". This advice is given with the following proviso :
wait until peace reigns again. Soft food usually contains suet and
honey, also dried flies and ants' eggs, both from abroad, and biscuit
meal. All these ingredients are difficult to get at present, and even
more important are mealworms which were produced both in

imported during the last year, the choice must necessarily be very
restricted. When the war is over I firmly intend to try my hand

NESTING OF LONG-TAILED BIRD OF
PARADISE
(Epimachus meyeri meyeri)

Aviculture has made long strides in recent years but many
steps remain to be taken. Each year we learn better the funda-
mental requirements of our charges and naturally their responses
become increasingly more normal. After all, we strive only for
normality.
The culmination of our efforts is reached in successful breeding
of a species. If this is accomplished, we cannot be far wrong !
If we accept this goal as a criterion, then we are still well short
of our objective with some groups of birds. Among these, we must
consider the Birds of Paradise, for no member of the Paradisaida
has yet been bred in captivity.
On the other hand, the credit side of the ledger is not entirely
blank, for there are several instances of eggs having been laid,
including the classical records of Mr. E. J. Brook's Princess
Stephanies and Mr. W. J. C. Frost's at the Surabaia Zoo.
In America there appears never to have been any attempt at
breeding, at least up to the present year. In spite of the present
impossibility of replacements, the collection of Birds of Paradise
in the New York Zoological Park is still in excellent condition
and now includes sixteen species, exclusive of Bower-birds. They
are kept principally in formal wall cages, of the type seen in the
Small Birds' House at the London Zoo, and while they do extremely

well and look very lovely, conditions are not conducive to breeding.
Moreover, as is well known, the sexes of most species will not live
together in such enclosures which is a further obstacle. In all our
experience, we have found only one Bird of Paradise of which pairs
could be kept together : the Long-tailed (Epimachus meyeri meyeri).
We have had two successive pairs of this form, and in each instance
the birds have lived peacefully together for years.
Our first pair of Long-tails was collected in the Central Division
of Papua by the New York Zoological Society's expedition in
1928-9. The second pair, secured by Mr. F. Shaw Mayer " near
the head of the Waria ", came to us in June of 1937, through the
co-operation of our present welcome associate, M. Jean Delacour.
These birds quickly settled down and provided much interesting
but as yet unpublished material on courtship displays. It never
occurred to anyone that this courtship was anything more than a
demonstration until, on 28th February, 1941, the female was found
in comatose condition. On examination, she was found to be
egg-bound. She responded well to treatment and soon produced
what appears to be the first known egg of this genus. As has been
reported in J^oofogim , 1 the egg was " Cartridge Buff" with the
expected markings of russet and gray, and measured
44&amp;apos;25 X 28'5 mm.
After the egg had been measured, photographed, and drawn,
it was placed in a bacteriological incubator, the only available
machine. This was run at 103 degrees, and when the egg was
tested on the seventh day, it was found to contain a living embryo.
While our ignorance of required conditions was complete, we
began to consider liquid diets and the other problems involved in
the care of a motherless fledgeling passerine. However, our plans
were fruitless, for on the eleventh day, candling showed that the
embryo was obviously dead.
Too late, of course, our own interpretation of the undescribed
nest of the species was placed in the cage. However, while both
birds were keenly interested, nothing came of it and they have now
gone into the long moulting period. Next year, long before
February, everything will be in readiness and--who knows ?

The field of knowledge relating to the avicultural side of
insectivorous birds has been well ploughed. At the present time it
is not easy to add to this, especially when one considers the following
points :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9979492" page_id="56239401"  page_num="205" year="" vol="">
(1) Specimens are unobtainable.
(2) That under the most hopeful conditions the period which
must elapse before new arrivals come to hand is likely to be long
deferred.
(3) That orthodox feeding substances are disappearing and
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.9774154" page_id="56239401"  page_num="205" year="" vol="">
that alternative substitutes are rationed or are under prohibition
for use in bird foods.
Although at the moment few of us can allocate time to the
pursuit of distracting recreation or experiment, it behoves us where
possible to endeavour to retain alive such specimens as we may
possess and to look forward to better conditions in the future. By
maintaining this interest we hope to be able to recommence when
conditions allow of it, so that the pursuit of aviculture may not only
prove as in the past an educational recreation, but may assist
ornithology proper in helping to clear up perhaps generally
accepted, but in some cases, doubtful information.
Birds coming under the term insectivorous cover many groups,
but in fanciers' parlance the term " Softbill " was used to denote
many very tough and hard-billed species which in captivity were
maintained on a mixed meal diet in contrast to that of species which
shelled or swallowed whole seeds or grains. Eliminating the less
adaptable (to confinement) species, insectivorous birds as a whole
are not only long-lived (when not compelled to endure conditions
for which they are quite unfitted) but their survival under changed
conditions to a reasonable age is often better as to expectation than
that of many small exotic Finches. Whatever kind of bird one may
keep it is a foregone conclusion that the aviary or cage containing
it needs more or less daily feeding attention and provided one
does this systematically I do not think this attention entails more
trouble in the case of insectivorous or nectar feeding birds than

the examination, cleaning, and replacement of seed for the other
types.
Apart from purely avicultural experiment, most insectivorous
birds possess a charm of demeanour and appearance, whether
soberly or brilliantly coloured, which makes them more interesting
to watch than seed-eaters, and many of them possess vocal abilities
which alone endear them to their owners. It is true birds in
Myadestes, Trogonida , and Ampelis are stolid, to state cases ; but
by far the greater number of species (coming under other insecti-
vorous, fruit-eating, and berry swallowing groups) display a
vivaciousness and activity which sets them apart from such species
as merely peck, shell, and swallow grains.
My avicultural interest in birds goes a long way back, and in
those days feeding methods and facilities for such were very different
to those available in, say, 1939. To go back almost 50 years, a
period when my almost daily acquaintances (of my grandfather's
age) included keepers of such birds as Warblers, Tit-Larks,
Nightingales, Larks, Thrushes, Starlings, and Blackbirds, etc., and
good keepers of them too. " German " Paste, egg, meat, and
biscuit, etc., were the main pasty stock foods used. Little was
known then regarding other ingredients commonly employed at
a later date. Except in such cases when nestling birds fell into the
hands of the old men just mentioned, their survival on the cottager's
crushed hemp seed and bread and milk diet when a nest was
taken was very doubtful, and these unfortunates died from either
malnutrition or the reverse, too good food without roughage.
Since that period most difficulties have been surmounted ; a more
intelligent interest arose in one direction and another, so that it
became possible for anyone with what I will call " bird-keeping
sense " successfully to keep in good health and contentment species
which were at one time approached with considerable temerity.
I have possessed or had under observation a wide range of birds
coming under this insectivorous category, and have also directly
and indirectly been in close touch with the commissariat depart-
ment concerning their maintenance. This has led me to conclude
that certain species can have too much protein food, in fact that
certain groups live longer and thrive better on coarser and less
expensive food mixtures than others. On the other hand, unless
these others have a regular supply of varied and more costly food

<bodyText confidence="0.998584769230769" page_id="56239403"  page_num="207" year="" vol="">
one cannot expect them to keep fit or survive if one tries to cut
down the costs of their maintenance.
Typical Turdida , Larks, and birds in Sturnus thrive on food
mixtures which do not agree with, for instance, birds in Sialia ,
Hylocichla , (Enanthe , Saxicola , Luscinia , Phanicurus , Lamprocolius , iS^reo,
and Cinnyricinclus , to state a few instances. In the space and time
at one's disposal at the moment, one cannot enter into details.
Generally speaking, one can with considerable success adopt
the methods advised for insectivorous birds given under various
headings in Aviculture , Vols. I and II. For a collection of birds, I have
in the past found it most convenient to provide a good mixture
of meat fibrine, farinaceous matter, and dried insects, particularly
those providing some chitinous matter in combination and breaking
that down for such species as do not need so much of it with various
things according to the species concerned, including potato, rice,
or swollen game or chicken biscuit meals. Grows and Pies as
a family must have meat or its equivalent. The appearance and
activity of a pair of Pies or Jays which get their mice, rats, pieces
of rabbit, dead birds, etc., in comparison to similar specimens
compelled to survive on a " pappy " farinaceous diet is remarkable.
On the other hand, provided one was getting a suitable stock
food, it was possible to maintain many other species in good fettle
for months on end without using any living insect food at all.
Much depends upon the genera to which birds belong, regarding
their power to assimilate and thrive upon types of foods.
The "gram" and "ghee" food used in the East in combination
with the ever ready and almost unstinted supply of easily obtained
living food or the maize meal plus ground silkworm pupae which
has been employed in Italy, both keep birds alive, but there is no
doubt that when such previously treated birds were weaned on
to a good insectile mixture which produced a more natural
excretion and pellet casting (irrespective of living food given and
the addition of fruit when eaten) they soon improved in both
health and general well-being.
One is often asked to recommend or give a list of attractive
species by would-be keepers of birds of this type, and when such
queries come my way I am afraid that I am inclined to say. What
is your experience ? What accommodation have you, and what
are your intentions ? Are you merely interested in song ? Do you

208 a. SILVER-CASUAL REMARKS ON INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS
want just half a dozen adaptable species for keeping in large cages
in or near a dwelling house and so forth, or are you interested in
trying to repeat a breeding experiment or hoping to try and breed
some species which yet has not been induced to rear progeny to
maturity in an aviary ?
Much depends upon these questions, for unless one is prepared
to provide suitable accommodation, etc., it is better to confine
one's attentions to the more hackneyed species of birds familiarly
kept.
Insectivorous birds as a whole are often dangerous to others in
mixed collections or to members of their own species (and even of
opposite sex out of the nesting season), although some species may
be mixed or kept with seed-eating birds under certain conditions.
Where accommodation may be provided for the attempt to breed
a given species, it should be borne in mind that their progeny are
reared solely on living food and that arrangements must be made
for a continual supply of it until such period as these young birds
are able to consume the artificial food provided for their parents.
When the mealworm of commerce was readily obtainable the work
of supplying living food was less tedious, but these days only
dwellers in the country, or those who can breed maggots, collect
cockroaches, and other living things including small earthworms,
can hope to be able adequately to assist their birds in rearing
their progeny.
In looking back one is confronted with certain facts concerning
the probability of possible successes with given species.
It appears that the birds most likely to " get off" young which
survive to maturity are those coming under such groups as typical
Turdida , Geocichla, Cittocincla, Sialia , Pycnonotus , and allied birds
Alauda and allies, Temenuchus , Acridotheres , Spreo, and Lamprocolius,
yet Leiothrix lutea , kept by many and not so completely insectivorous
as many other species, has proved disappointing. Apart from
meagre records, I have yet to see in an aviary birds which have
positively been reared to maturity. I did see one miserable
youngster in a privet bush in a Hampstead aviary on one occasion,
but nothing more was heard of it. I have accommodated in
separate aviaries alone exceptionally vigorous pairs on several
occasions, which have either built or in some cases laid, but never
incubated properly ; and usually both nest and eggs disappeared

in spite of the fact that no cats could disturb and the birds were as
tame as domestic Pigeons as long as no movement was made to
scare them. These birds were inexpensive and if in the future
they are as readily obtainable as in the past, I should highly regard
the achievement of any aviculturist who could show to his friends
a few Pekin Robins positively bred by him during the preceding
year.
Many people are not able to provide aviaries especially for
the attempt to breed birds, but a much larger number of bird-
keepers can manage from six to a dozen species in large cages or
small aviaries in a bird room, or its equivalent, or give them
summer accommodation in small aviaries in a garden which in
any case has a recuperative effect upon many species which for
the rest of the year need reasonable warmth and protection.
Whilst most people living in the country or on the outskirts of
towns find no inclination to confine species which carry on their
lives almost on one's doorstep, there are people keenly interested in
the musical utterances of birds and who keep them mainly for that
purpose. For those I recommend a good Song Thrush, Blackbird,
Shama, Mocking Bird, Whistling Thrush, and Rock Thrush,
and if smaller birds are desired, a Blackcap Warbler, Pekin Robin,
Tree Pipit, Nightingale, or Sprosser and Bush Lark. For those who
like to keep a few " showy " birds of reasonably robust constitution,
a little collection which includes a Scarlet Tanager, Superb
Spreo, Silver-blue Tanager, Niltava Flycatcher, Hangnest, Yellow-
winged Sugar-bird, comprises six birds which attract one's visitors.
Where roomy accommodation is available for movement few
birds show up in a garden aviary as effectively as a pair of Blue
Pies, preferably Urocissa melanocephala occipitalis , and with these
one might try to include a Hunting Grow ( Cissa ), Swainson's Long-
tailed Jay ( Calocitta ), Steller's Jay, a Pileated Jay, a Himalayan
Whistling Thrush, and one of the Cissoloplia group such as
Beechey's or an allied species. It should be understood by
collection I do not mean keeping these birds together. Separate
accommodation is best and in many of the cases imperative.
Many Jays and Pies " sing " and when in good fettle are at
least amusing when so occupied. One should not overlook the
beauty of any bird in Garrulus or Pica. My choice is Lalocitta
lidthi, but my chances of owning it are remote. Provided one has

impression second only to Paradise Birds and equalled only by
Glossy Starlings, also favourites of mine. Of these I recommend
Long-tailed, Burchell's, Royal, Beautiful Spreo, Purple-headed, the

one of the most dainty, long-lived, and easily kept insectivorous
birds is J^ostewps palebrosa. A single male kept as a pet will exhibit
wonderful bird intelligence, advise one of outside temperatures,
and is a non-irritant vocalist and one of the few birds which retains
its yellowish colour fully developed after a moult in captivity
which is not excelled by a wild specimen. At the moment circum-
stances will not allow me to say more.

By N. Wharton-Tigar
The Editor has asked me to write a few notes on my Chloropsis
for this number, and I am glad to do so because I think there are
fewer species that do better in captivity either in cage or aviary
given the right conditions.
The one representative of this family that I still have glories in
the high sounding name of the Malachite-shouldered Leaf Bird
(Chloropsis sonnerati zosterops). He came to me seven years ago.
One spring day in 1934, Alastair Morrison came to see me, and
said there were some new birds at Gamages and among them an
unusual Fruit-sucker. I lost no time in going to see, and came
back in triumph, with my treasure. He is not one of the most
beautiful of the genus, being mainly a bright green with black
throat, and is larger than the commoner Gold-fronted (C. aurifrons).
He is a bird full of personality, and with wonderful powers of song
and mimicry, and is of course very tame, and always seems happy,
singing most of the day. He can copy any bird, and even tunes,
and for this reason it is better that he should hear no ugly sounds.
At the present time his favourite song is a perfect rendering of the
Blackbirds' lovely melody. I have written before about this bird,
and his picture appeared in the magazine of July, 1937, in a
coloured plate by Roland Green.

I have had several other Chloropsis , beginning with a faultless
pair of Hardwick's (C. hardwickei) ; they were unique at the time, as
a hen of this species had not been seen here for twenty years. The
male bird in full plumage is splendid, and my bird had a welcoming
refrain which was most engaging whenever I entered the room.
I sent them to a show, where I fear they were given too many
mealworms, for when I entered the bird room the next day, my
little friend sang his delightful little song and fell dead before
my eyes. You can imagine my dismay. I also had a fine pair of
the Javan Black-throated ( Chloropsis cochinchinnensis nigrocollis) , one
of the prettiest of the genus ; it is a forest species, and very little is
known of its wild life. When writing about this pair in January,
1937, I said I hoped they might breed some day. It might interest
readers to hear that, when turned out in an aviary in the summer
of 1938, they built a nest in a small round basket placed in a dead
bush, and twice the hen laid two creamy eggs blotched with brown
streaks. The effort went no further, and even this small success is,
as far as I know, the first attempt by this species to nest in
captivity ; but not the first attempt for the genus as Dr. Amsler,
that most clever breeder of Softbills, did actually succeed some years
ago in rearing almost to the fully-fledged and independent stage a
nest of C. aurifrons.
I once had entrusted to my care for several months a very
lovely and closely allied species, Chloropsis cochinchinnensis ictero -
cephalia , which is similar in build and size, has the same blue on
wings, and a yellow head. It is very rare in captivity, though
Mr. Frost has told me that it is not really uncommon in its native
habitat.
Looking back, I seem to have been successful in keeping birds
of this particular genus in good condition ; far more so, for instance,
than with the Shama, which I admire so much. Although I have
possessed some outstanding Shamas none now lives to tell the tale,
and that speaks for itself, but I shall try again, and hope also to have
more of the Chloropsis. In choosing a specimen one should listen
for the song, as individuals vary a good deal ; they require plenty
of exercise, and must not be overfed : that sounds absurd at the
present time, but I mean, of course, in the happy days to which
we all look forward.

I have advocated Softbills almost to the extent of boredom in
the years preceding the war, and have been rewarded with a new
recruit here and there, but there has always been a certain amount of
shrinking on the part of contemplative owners. Now those would-be
owners appear to be still in the same contemplative stage because
the birds are not too readily obtainable. This can be very easily
accounted for by the shortage of seed and the high prices asked for
what is available by profiteers and other jacks-of-all-trades who
have been buying up stocks to sell again. This has been a wicked
ramp and I am sure there have been many valuable birds lost as
these merchants, carried away with the # s. d. idea, have supple-
mented good mixtures with a lot of wild seeds which are almost
useless from a feeding point of view. Fanciers, like corks on troubled
waters, will always ride the waves and if Hardbills are forbidden
then they will turn as a substitute (?) to the subjects of this article.
This is not mentioned in a vindictive way however and if their
needs can be satisfied then new adherents are made, not easily
to be lost again ; but the birds are not theirs for the asking, nor is
this reason hard to find. Softbills become endeared to their owners
and, as their food is readily obtainable, the need for disposal does
not arise and any such wish is usually farthest from the owners'
thoughts.
Coupled with our Editor's wish it was my intention to write
on the commoner Softbills--but what is a common Softbill nowa-
days ? Perhaps I should cast my mind back to the days when the
weekly journals announced the arrival of importations and not a
few of us would literally be waiting on the doorsteps of the
advertisers' premises. What reminiscences these errands make
to be sure--telephone calls and frequent visits when a boat was
late in arrival, very often a prolonged but determined waiting and
the inevitable last train home--but it was good fun even if we were
lost for reasonable excuses when we did eventually arrive home.
Sometimes it was a trip to the docks to see the birds on board
ship and in some cases one would see a veritable zoological collection
there. I well remember on one occasion being shown the crates

of monkeys when a young elephant snatched out a package and
waggled it on the end of his trunk. One had to move about
very warily for fear a panther might be able to get a claw through
the wire-mesh of his box, or that one might stand uncomfortably
close to a python.
To hark back to the subject : when peaceful days come back
again and avicultural activity in the shape of importations is
resumed, the first and foremost to find a buyer, at least in the
commoners, will be a pair of Shamas. Such birds are not missed
until they are absent and then we realize that the Shama was the
cleanest and most intelligent of all the members of the bird family.
How he would sit, deep in thought, warbling quietly to himself,
coming right back to attention at the sight of a tit-bit ; not that
the Shama is easily suited that way, unless it be in the form of a
mealworm, as he is one of the very few Softbills which refuses
practically everything in the form of fruit or vegetable and cares
only for insects. I have kept quite a number of these birds and
have always given a rich diet, consisting of ant-cocoons, dried flies,
silkworm pupae, c.l.o. biscuit mixed with dripping and given
daily with freshly-hard boiled egg. Added to this was a scraping
of raw meat and a dozen mealworms. Garden worms and sundry
grubs found in the process of digging or hoeing came as further
extras, nor did I see anything wrong with such feeding. On
occasions I have been asked why a Shama has had a fit and without
hesitation have put it down to poor feeding. There was a frantic
appeal from a person who had entered his Indo-Chinese (Long-
tailed) Shama for the last National Show telling me his bird had
had a fit and what could be done in the matter. I wired back
" feed richly " and that same bird was top in a class of twenty-one
a week later. This may sound revolutionary, but it is my
experience. Next in order of favourites is the Golden-fronted
Fruitsucker, excelling the leader in plumage-attractiveness, lacking
in vocal ability, but running close for intelligence. These are not
so easy to keep, mainly because the man-in-the-street, or more
correctly the beginner, thinks he must give it insectivorous mixture
--or go to the other extreme and offer an abundance of fruit so
that solid food is ignored. Fruit they certainly like and one might
think is vitally necessary (of which more anon) but a little sweetened
soaked sponge-cake, biscuit-meal, and ant-cocoons do help to

balance the diet. Bananas are fed to them fairly liberally by the
dealers, but I get them accustomed to taking this fruit in very
small proportions, preferring pear and grapes, with orange on
alternative days. At first one must keep this species constantly
awake until a reasonable time for roosting as they will tuck their
heads away and sit like a ball as soon as the first signs of dusk appear
and will not be disturbed ; a very long night means a hungry
bird the next day so you can understand why I mention this. Of
Fruitsuckers there are quite a number of species, but the Golden-
fronted is far the most likely to be met with and can be the only
species within the scope of this article.
Having similar ways are the Hangnests, the species for mention
being the Brazilian. A bright and breezy individual is he, caring
little for anything, but seeming to appreciate every happening
around him, especially if a mealworm or a slice of orange feature
in the activities. Bright yellow and jet black with a dash or two of
white makes up his ensemble with a bowing as graceful as that of
Monsieur de Paris. He is capable of uttering quite a few different
notes together with a summoning whistle. Altogether a fine chap
and should be treated similarly to the last-mentioned.
Dama or Orange-headed Ground Thrushes usually come over
with the Shamas and although quiet in their manner, are lovely
creatures with a grey mantle with a faint white bar on the shoulders,
orange head, face, chest, and under parts, and a large, intelligent
black eye ; they make an instant appeal. Nor would one be unwise
to be attracted to the point of ownership as there is nothing to say
against them ; they are of bold shape and manner when pursuing
a tit-bit or coming down to the feeding vessel, are absolutely harm-
less to all other birds, large or small, and the cock has a loud whistle
similar to our native Thrushes. There are many who doubt this
bird's vocal abilities as it can be seen moving the feathers of its
throat with no sound emanating or, at the best, just a faint warbling.
But in the Spring, in the early morning, one can hear him at his
best and loudest if he does not see the intruder. There is one
point of caution and that is, as this species frequents the ground
a lot, one must take care that cleanliness is strictly observed, other-
wise the feet may become dirty--a complaint always to be avoided.
Dyal birds seem to find friends but to me they are not appealing,

which would come out on a stick and whistle by request. In the
same consignment one may come across a few Mynahs, though the
possibility of a talker will be somewhat remote. In spite of this
Mynahs are grand birds--but please, they must be given room.
Nothing is more heart-rending than to see such a bird hopping
from perch to perch enured to a life of boredom. Those which can
talk might be excepted to some extent as they seem to find so much
enjoyment in this pastime that boredom is killed. Another strong
point in favour of extensive quarters is that they have more space
in &amp;apos;which to avoid getting dirty, as they surely will do in a cramped
space. This can be quite understood as their food consists, normally,
almost entirely of fruit, supplemented with soaked biscuit and
boiled potato. In good condition, from the appearance view-
point, a Mynah, if of one of the black species, is a handsome fellow.
Of the three commoner black kinds, the Lesser Hill Mynah should
prove quite a suitable member : being a smaller bird, he naturally
does not call for the space that the Giant Javan might, and in
other respects he is similar. That the Mynah, if a talker, is a good
one, is a fact which even the staunchest Parrot-lover cannot deny, the
voice being deep rich and mellow--with a veritable Oxford accent;
though the vocabulary is usually short, the words are slowly and
distinctly delivered. It is highly improbable that an adult bird
will use this talent and those which do arrive as linguists are taught
from babyhood by native trappers. This accounts for the fact
that not a few have been known to speak Hindustani quite well,
and one particular specimen I knew was so very solemn in his
utterances in this tongue that he may have been practising hierology.
Scalded hound-meal or broken dog biscuit seem to suit the Mynahs
fairly well with the addition of sultanas, either soaked or dry,
though I add hard-boiled egg and potato with a piece or two of
raw meat now and again.
Jay-Thrushes could in the old days always be found at the
larger dealers, and the most impressive of these birds was the
White-crested species. One might be carried away by the cackling
laughter of a Kookaburra, but after a while one may wish this
Kooky to be carried away instead ; the White-crested Jay-Thrush
is more refined and, whilst at times he is over-ambitious, his voice
is never raucous and, to cast an eye in his direction and see the
joyful, pleased-with-life expression on his face, one inevitably

enters into the spirit of hilarity with him. For a comparatively
large bird the space required need not necessarily be in proportion,
as he prefers to jump and only uses his wings as balancers. My
pair of Red-tailed Jay-Thrushes have this same characteristic,
at times dropping to the floor from a height of four or five feet and
returning on a rebound to their original places with never a flutter
of the wings. Neither species seems to mind the cold in the least
and the more rain the better they like it. Soaked dog biscuit,
potato, and fruit is the former's fare, but the Red-tails like a finer
grading and take kindly to insectivorous mixture, hard-boiled egg,
currants, and apple. This latter bird is really out of the scope of
these notes, but I had to mention the feeding for fear of a misunder-
standing with that of the White-crested.
Starlings offer us a wider range, included in which family
I might mention the Superb Spreo, Green Glossy, Long-tailed
Glossy, Purple-headed, Royal, and Abyssinian red-eyed, and
whilst the Amethyst, Ruppell's, Purple-shouldered, and Crowned
do appear, their prices keep them out of bounds as far as common-
ness is concerned. One point I should like to stress and that is
that the Amethysts are totally different in plumage in the opposite
sexes, but all others are as alike as the proverbial two peas in a
pod. Differing from our native chimney-stack caroller, these
African Starlings are much cleaner in their habits. All seem to
prefer food slightly on the coarse side and together with
insectivorous mixture like potato, currants, sultanas, a scrap of
beef, and such fruit as may be available. It has been said that
Starlings should not be given earth-worms, but I beg to differ,
having always offered these to all of the above-mentioned species,
and never a specimen having shown ill effect.
Readers may think I have forgotten the Pekin Robin ; I had
overlooked it as it might well have been placed second in the list.
If Pekin Robins were five pounds a pair they would find just as
many real devotees ; they have every advantage that a bird might
be expected to possess and no drawbacks. The name " Yellow-
bellied Liothrix " is far more suited to them than their ordinary
every-day name and is self-expressive, I think. A bright, lively
little fellow, with feathers like hair and a tail like a fish, he is here,
there and everywhere, hopping and skipping with care-free
abandon, stopping only for food or to utter his pleasing if short

song. Neither is he particular about food, subsisting on crushed
hemp and breadcrumbs on the voyage here and accepting without
fuss, insectivorous mixture, boiled rice, fruit of any kind, bread
and milk, or seed ! In cages they are entertaining and cheerful,
in aviaries they look their best following their natural love for cover
and preferring to keep to the lower half, a part little enough
occupied by most perching birds. As mixers they are ideal, being
quick enough to escape unwanted attention from larger species,
not squabbling with others of similar size, and never bullying the
small fry.
The avian jewels can be found to a great extent in the family
of Tanagers, but in general these are difficult birds to keep for any
length of time although there are a few exceptions ; the member
which will fill the bill is the Scarlet, nor do I think there is any
bird with more depth or purity of colour--a brilliant shining
scarlet foiled with black. More than a " Chip, chip " I have yet
to hear from those I have or did possess, but this scantiness is out-
weighed by extreme vivacity and cheerfulness generally. Fruit
of any kind with crumbled biscuit or cake keeps him well, as it
does his rusty-coloured spouse.
Forgive me for having to mention bananas and oranges--one
might have thought when these fruits were denied us that our
birds would have failed to get sufficient nutriment, yet it is remark-
able how well they all seem to be. Practically the only fruit
obtainable now is in the form of dried sultanas, raisins, and currants,
with an occasional orange. There are tinned pears, apricots, and
peaches to be had, though I must say I have never used them,
substituting or rather supplementing the first-mentioned with
boiled carrot and boiled beetroot. Of course one does not add
vinegar to the beetroot ! To get the best from the dried fruits
they are placed in a vessel and covered with boiling water, and
allowed to stand overnight--by next morning they are practically
as full as their skins will allow.
One can enlarge on these points and add to the species, but
I feel I have come to the end of my tether as far as the title goes
so perhaps I may step up in a subsequent issue (D.V.).

(Nyctidromus albicollis ) IN CAPTIVITY

One of the thrills of my childhood was the finding of a Nightjar's
nest and eggs on the moors near my home. I collected eggs then,
but somehow I had a twinge of conscience at the time and I felt
that they belonged more to their wild setting than to my egg
cabinet, so to my credit I left them and have never regretted it.
Since those days when I used to hear the " churring " of the
soft-winged night hawks on the sparsely wooded hillsides of the
Peak district I have always cherished an affection for those strange
birds and during protracted stays in various parts of the world
I have met with many species including the unique Pennant-
winged, a bird which has a single feather in each wing nearly
3 feet long.
The European species has been kept several times very success-
fully and even bred in captivity, two nests having been reared to
maturity. This I think is one of the greatest achievements in the
annals of aviculture. Especially as the birds nested on the hearth-
rug of the owner's living-room.
The late Mr. Galloway, who was a great expert on the keeping
of the more delicate " softbills ", had a Nightjar for over three
years.
Of course, all the birds which have been kept in captivity
have been hand-reared, as it is next to impossible to keep birds
caught fully adult owing to them battering themselves about and
spoiling their very soft plumage.
The first exotic Nightjar to be imported into this country is
the subject of this article, and was generously given to me by the
Hon. Anthony Chaplin when he was the Editor of the Magazine.
This bird had been hand-reared in South America and was brought
over to this country before it assumed its adult plumage.
Though the bird was in perfect plumage when given to me,
a week's residence in an aviary at the " Zoo " and a long journey
in a travelling basket did not improve matters. The flight and tail
feathers, which were nearly full grown, received a severe check,
they seemed to dry off before the base was properly formed.

S. PORTER-NOTES ON WHITE-NECKED NIGHTJAR IN CAPTIVITY 2IQ
Consequently in a week's time the bird was unable to fly. Being
ill at the time and not having a large enough aviary empty indoors,
the bird was left in my study and fed by members of the household.
In a few days the state of the room can be imagined. It looked as
though the painters had been whitewashing the ceiling and had
forgotten to cover the carpet over ! Later on the bird was placed
in a small conservatory.
The Nightjar's chief food until the summer months when
moths could be obtained was minced meat made into small pellets,
dipped into water, and then rolled in dry insectivorous food. At
first the bird would readily run towards one with outstretched
wings, seize the meat, and swallow it, but later on it became more
nervous and had to be hand-fed.
It was remarkable the small amount of food the bird required,
two pellets (about the size of one's thumb) given in the evening,
one in the morning, and one at lunch-time was all that was required.
If not hungry the bird would refuse to swallow the food and being
put on the ground it would throw it out of its mouth.
Though the beak was very tiny the gape was enormous and
seemed to go almost to the back of the head. It was more like a
fish's mouth than a bird's. From the upper part of the gape grew
a row of hard black bristles. The bird also seemed to secrete a large
amount of saliva. Both the bristles and the saliva being necessary
to the catching and swallowing of the large night-flying moths
and beetles upon which the birds feed in their natural state.
Mr. Chaplin thought that the serrated middle claw about which
naturalists have always been puzzled, is used to comb the bristles
on the upper part of the gape ; this would be quite feasible for
no doubt a quantity of " dust " would be left on them after the
swallowing of a large moth.
The White-necked Nightjar appears to have a very wide range
in tropical South and Central America. Beebe writing on the
birds of British Guiana says : " Here, too, the White-necked Night-
hawks come at twilight and called their lonesome c who-are-you '
and performed their weird dances in the moonlight, sometimes
fifty or more together." Speaking of this bird in The Field Book
of the Birds of the Panama Canal Z one th e author says, " A very common
bird of the Canal Zone, very numerous in the spring along the
sides of the Gamboa road. When driving along that road at night

one may see their eyes shine out from the darkness like miniature
headlights. They have a habit of jumping a few inches from the
ground repeatedly but settling back in the same place after each
jump. I saw numbers of them along the paths around Gatun at
night, especially under the street lights. During the mating season
two or three of these birds get together and utter low guttural
noises impossible to describe. The ordinary note may be represented
by ' Kwe-ah-reo 5 uttered in a clear ringing and rather tremulous

SUNBIRDS

I have been asked to write a few notes on Sunbirds and though
no authority on the subject, I have kept these birds for many years.
I imported some when I returned from South Africa and they make
charming pets, getting very tame, not difficult to feed, seeming
happy in captivity, and living to a good age in many cases--indeed
I was awarded the medal of the Societe Nationale d'Acclimatation
de France, in 1920, for keeping a Malachite Sunbird for seven
years. But this seems little compared to a Purple Sugarbird I have
had twelve years, which is still with me, in perfect health and
plumage. I think the most attractive of all the Sunbirds is the
Malachite, from Africa--beautiful in form and colour, but only a
wheeze for a song. This bird gets very tame, and loves bathing in
a flat glass dish, out of its cage. I have noticed this in all the
specimens of this Sunbird I have kept, whereas many of the smaller
ones will not get into any kind of bath, but splash on the edge, or
like to be sprayed. But above all they like to flutter in a privet
hedge in the aviary, after a shower of rain, and to watch them
preening in the sunshine afterwards, is a sight never to be forgotten.
The Purple Sunbird, from India, has a nice song, but it is a dark
bird, and its lovely colouring is only really seen in the sunlight.
The Amethyst-rumped Sunbird is small, and very confiding, but

delicate. The smallest Sunbird I ever had was a tiny Collared
Sunbird (Anthreptes collaris elachior) from the Usembara Mountains
of North-east Tanganyika ; and another rare one from the Gold
Coast is the Splendid Sunbird, one of which I have had four years,
and he still keeps his shining plumage. A coloured plate of this
bird, by Roland Green, came out in the Avicultural Magazine in
1940.
The southern Bifasciated Sunbird (Cinnyris mariquensis) is
another beautifully coloured one, but there are so many, and all
so lovely, it is impossible to give a list of them in a short space.
Anyone lucky enough to possess Shelley's book of coloured plates
of Sunbirds, can see for themselves how lovely they are, though
this is rather misleading as to size, as the birds are much smaller
than depicted in the book. I keep mine in a temperature between
6o* and 70* in open wire cages, as large as possible, and they are
fed on the usual mixture of condensed milk, Mellins food, honey,
and marmite or, in the winter, Virol, with a grape for those who
like it. They seem to do well in cages, though nothing puts a bloom
on the plumage like letting them out separately in a garden aviary,
to find gnats and flies, but how few days in the summer can one
be sure of the temperature keeping the same.

Blue Amazon Parrot in New York Zoo
A blue Amazon Parrot, one of the greatest rarities in the bird world, is now
on exhibition in the main Bird House at the Bronx Zoo. The normal coloration
of the Parrot is green and yellow, but because of a flaw in its genetic inheritance,
the normal colours are entirely lacking and every feather on the bird is blue.
As far as the Zoo has been able to determine, this is the only blue Amazon
Parrot ever exhibited alive in any public zoo. In the past forty years, Mr. Lee S.
Crandall, Curator of Birds, has never seen another live Blue Parrot, and only
one mounted specimen in a museum. The Blue Parrot was presented to the
Bronx Zoo by Miss Louise Washington, of Mendham, N.J., in whose possession
it had been for fifteen years.
The Blue Parrot is actually a Yellow-naped Amazon Parrot (Amazona aura
palliata ), and in the Zoo's Bird House it is exhibited side by side with a normally-
coloured specimen. The green and yellow colours in the normal bird are created
by yellow and brown pigments in the feathers, the brown not appearing as brown
but being combined with the yellow and transmitted by reflecting prisms in the
.feathers to appear as green. Occasionally a Parrot in which the brown pigment
is lacking, so that only yellow appears, is seen in large collections of Parrots.
The Bronx Zoo exhibited one of these all-yellow Parrots several years ago.

Technically it is known as a " lutino ", a word applying to an abnormally yellow
bird just as " albino " refers to an abnormally white one. In the Bronx Zoo's
blue Parrot, the normal yellow pigment is lacking and its absence creates--by
means of the reflecting prisms in the feathers--the appearance of blue. Actually
the feathers, when held up to a strong light, are seen to be basically brown.
Such an abnormally blue bird is known as a " cyanthino ".
Blue strains have been developed by breeding and selection in various other
birds, and blue Masked Lovebirds are regularly bred in California, in France,
and England. Blue Shell Parrakeets are common, and both blue and yellow
specimens of the Indian Ring-neck and Alexandrine Parrakeets have occurred
in India. They have been selected and bred in England by Mr. A. Ezra. Normally
all of these birdsare various shades of green. The blue variety are even rarer than
the yellow.

Moorhens.
I was interested in Mr. Yealland's article on Waders, and particularly in
what he writes about young Moorhens. I gather that he does not think that they
could be reared otherwise than in a brooder.
A few years ago I put three Moorhen eggs under a barn-yard hen, and though
it seemed as if they must be crushed under her great feet they all survived. It
was very amusing to see how they kept jumping up at her beak expecting to have
their food held out to them, and how puzzled the old bird was by these antics.
However, with much clucking and dropping of food in front of them she taught
them successfully to feed themselves. In addition to ordinary chickfood they were
supplied with duckweed and similar pond products. As pets they were certainly
most quaint and entertaining, but they do get wild very soon. Before reaching
the age of three months, mine had begun to lurk further and further from the
house, when they came to a horrid end by swallowing hooks baited with half-
dried worms, which had unfortunately been left hanging within their reach after
a fishing excursion. Pets at liberty are far more interesting than those that are
captive, but the perils they encounter are so many and various that their careers
are usually much shorter.
