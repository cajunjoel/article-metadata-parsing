For I9II-I9I2.
During the past year the progress of the Society has been
steady and satisfactory. No important changes in the adminis-
tration have been made, except the appointment of Prof. G. H.
Wooldridge, F.R.C.V.S., as Hon. Veterinary Surgeon in suc-
cession to Mr. Arthur Gill, M.R.C.V.S , who was compelled to
resign that post on his departure for Canada.
The membership shows a slight but encouraging increase,
as compared with the last few years; and thanks to the ready
co-operation of those members who have contributed articles
and notes on birds, and of those who have kindly subscribed to
the illustration and general funds of the Society; the Magazine,
under the editorship of Mr. J. L,. Bonhote, has fully maintained
its standard of excellence in every particular.
The desire of the Council that Members of the Society
should be given the opportunity of becoming personally ac-
quainted was again practically expressed by holding an informal
reception, followed by tea, in the Zoological Gardens after their
meeting in June. To further the same object, they propose to
have a dinner--the date and particulars of which will be an-
nounced later--at a London restaurant in the winter.
Signed for the Council,

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee, to
any Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any
species of bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in
captivity in Great Britain or Ireland. Ail}&amp;apos; Member wishing to obtain the
Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the Magazine within
about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young and furnish such
evidence of the facts as the Executive Committee may require. The Medal
will be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough
to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents.
&amp;apos;fhe account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and should describe the plumage of the young
and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weigh when the question of awarding
the Medal is under consideration.
&amp;apos;fhe parents of the young must be the bond fide property of the
breeder. An evasion of this rule, in any form whatever, will not only dis-
qualify the breeder from any claim to a Medal in that particular instance,
but will seriously prejudice any other claims he or she may subsequently
advance for the breeding of the same or any other species.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall
have been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Committee reserve the right
to issue it in silve.i in very special cases), and measures 2 |inches in
diameter. It bears on the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest
containing eggs, and the words "The Avicutural Society -- founded 1894."
On the reverse is the following inscription : "Awarded to {name of recipient)
for rearing the young of (name of species), a species not previously bred in
captivity in the United Kingdom."

Gi ns canadensis. Grus carunculata.
By R. COSGRAVE.
In 1909 and 1910 these most interesting birds failed to
incubate their eggs. This year they were successful in doing so
during the last week in April and the first week in May. Nest-
making was a very serious business with them ; after a good deal
of hesitation as to site they settled down in earnest on the grass,
about four yards from the pond, and got together a considerable
heap of grass, sticks, hay, and any sort of rubbish that happened
to be handy.
O11 May 7th one egg was laid, which was the usual Wattled
size but the colour of the Canadian, and to my knowledge no
more were added. Taking equal shares both birds at once com-
menced to incubate the egg--the period was 35 days. We did
not take any special care or interest in the nest, just merely left
the egg as a natural amusement for the birds.
The young remained on or quite close to the nest for two
days and appeared to be very feeble; from the first it was most
carefully fed and nursed by both parents, and while one hunted
the long grass for insects the other brooded. It began to take
artificial food at ten days old ; although we gave a good variety
of this it preferred the sheep's heart and rabbit's flesh, and was
always ready to take it, although the amount of insects taken
from the parents was extraordinary--the search for these con-
tinued practically all day.

24 Bleeding of the s Canadian and ? Wattled Cranes.
In appearance, the young when hatched differed consider-
ably from any young Cranes that I have seen. The whole body
colour was chestnut, leading to cinnamon on the breast and
belly ; bill, legs, and feet light horn ; eyes dark. Instead of the
legs being long and awkward to propel, they were quite stumpy ;
the head and neck were to all appearance two sizes too large
which gave the little creature the most absurd top-heavy look.
At five days old it was lively and active, following its parents
everywhere they went, but it remained stumpy and the same
colour for about four weeks, then a great change took place, the
head and neck fined down and the bird began to grow fast;
particularly noticeable was the remarkable rapidity with which
the legs grew. At present (Sept. 23) it leads its father in height
by at least three inches. The body plumage is dark grey;
primaries and tail black ; legs and feet dark horn ; head and neck
fawn ; eyes dark hazel ; bill red at base, darkening towards the
point. Taking into consideration its size and carriage, although
there are no traces of Wattles showing yet, the probabilities are,
that it will be like its mother. The photograph shows the young
at three weeks old with the parents, whose previous history is
worth recording.
The Canadian was bred here in 1899, and is very active
and attractive. He likes to show what he can do in dancing,
going round and round with both wings expanded, now and
again picking up a piece of turf or stick ; these he will throw up
in the air time after time and occasionally catch them in mid-air.
He has a majestic step of his own, and this, combined with his
dark grey uniform and red cap, gives one the impression of a
youthful military sergeant. However, he is not war-like, we
find him peaceful with other Cranes and various birds. On the
other hand, Mrs. Wattled likes a good fight and is not particular
what with. She arrived here in rather bad health in 1893, and
being in fully adult plumage we could not estimate her age.
When sufficiently recovered from her journey she was placed in
the company of all our other Cranes, and all went well for a few
days. Then came a tragedy ! she actually killed three very fine
Demoiselles and, when discovered, was actually getting 011 with
more. That of course spelt solitary confinement during the

remainder of her natural life. For several years she lived alone
in a rather cramped aviary, apparently in the best of health,
making a nest and producing usually an egg or two each year.
About four years ago her health broke down, and it was quite
plain that if she did not have a change of residence her life
would be a short one. It was decided to give her a certain
amount of liberty once again--but under police supervision so
to speak--in a large compartment at the Cranes pond. Here
she began to look her former self and commenced to make love
to Mr. Canadensis, who happened to want a wife at that time :
it was a joyful meeting when he was admitted to her company.
Like her mate she is an expert dancer and appears to get excited
when laughed at by spectators. Her waltz is quite of au advanced
type, she keeping up the swing for several minutes, only stopping
to come up to the fence for a word of praise, or if asking, " How
is that?" and then starts off again to renew the performance.
Since her release from prison her dancing exhibitions have
ceased, owing doubtless to the cares of married life.
BIRD CAGES.
By Katharine Currey.
I keep several of my birds in a double set of cages, which
involves a little trouble, but they thrive wonderfully well and
their intelligence is greatly developed by this mode of life, which,
however, would not answer for breeding birds, as they must then
be in a stationary aviary or cage.
I will explain as briefly as I can how I manage this. The
bird's home is an ordinary large cage that can be lifted about,
and in which he has his food and roosting perch under a covered-
in end. I have light wooden shelters to cover permanently one
end of the cage of all my birds, for it is most cruel not to give
them a hiding-place.
In the garden I have large, light movable aviaries screwed
or hooked together, and they can betaken to pieces and put away
flat against a wall. They are made of small-meshed wire, painted
green, and have a door at either end, one door large enough to
admit a person. In these aviaries, which are of different sizes

Mrs. Katharine Currky,
(the largest 5ft. 4m. high to top of gable, 5ft. 4m. long and 2ft.
6in. wide), I place boughs of the trees the birds are partial to,
and there are movable perches as well--of wood with the bark on.
On the ground (unless it is on a smooth lawn that would be
injured) I place logs and stones for insects, beetles, woodlice,
worms and slugs to collect under, and move them every two or
three days to let the biids catch them. They have a large
flower-pot saucer of fresh water to bathe in, and in hot weather
I water the aviaries well to have the atmosphere damp. The
boughs keep fresh for a few days by placing them in long tins
of water hung on to the wire inside the aviary, the water changed
every day or two.
Every morning, after cleaning out the cages, I place one
of them on the ground against a door of one of the aviaries.
Up against the larger door I hang a wire-netting screen on the
aviary to fill up the space between the top of the door and the top
of the cage; the cage keeps it firm in its place. I open the cage
door into the aviary and the bird has a large pleasure-ground to
fly in and enjoy himself in all day till sunset, when I merely have
to tap with a stick on the aviary and they hop into their home-
cage on to the roosting-perch. The advantage of the aviaries
being movable is that the birds' pasture-ground can thus be
changed, and their position in the garden, on a lawn, or in an
orchard, with a warm aspect in winter and a cool shady one in
summer, and a sheltered one against March winds. The aviary
is easy to lift about and can be placed so as to enclose a little tree
or shrub or a tangle on an old stump or bit of rockery, where the
birds can have a happy hunting-ground. My birds very soon
learnt to understand their mode of life, and clamour to get
out every morning, and generally go in to roost of their own
accord.
I take them in out of the way of cats, rats, owls or weasels,
for I have had some sad experience of leaving them out all night
in the aviary. They go out all the year round, in almost all
weathers; some birds stand the hardest frost and the coldest
winds, if provided with plenty of food and water, but others do
not. I have to take in my Rock Thrush (I have had him about
fifteen years) whenever there is a cold wind, especially now that

lie is old, but lie lias perfect health and is moulting capitally.
I11 stormy or rainy weather I cover the house-cage with a painted
piece of tin. The wild birds come and talk to the aviary birds,
and they all sing together. My birds are never ill and live for
many years.
With regard to keeping birds in little cages, where they
have 110 room to move their wings, and 110 protection to retreat
to, I have no words to express the horror I feel at such real
cruelty, and I consider the caging of Larks fiendish. Among all
the wonderful and beautiful works of Creation the bird is almost
the most marvellous, and the power of that exquisitely constructed
wing destroyed and paralysed in a wired box is the refinement of
torture, for a bird that is capable of such intense joy must be
equally sensitive to suffering.
I am an enthusiastic aviculturist and my birds are my
friends, and for this very reason I feel so strongly about their
being treated in a manner wholly antagonistic to their nature
and requirements. If anyone wishes to understand something
of the miracle of flight in a bird, "The Airy Way," by Mr.
Dewar, will illustrate what I mean. The imprisonment of birds
has been allowed to go on unchecked far too long, and in an
enlightened country it should never even be possible. The
cottager in the country and the tenement dweller in London
has no idea that he is inflicting cruelty on the bird he keeps
as a pet in an unprotected cage (very rarely sanitary) fed im-
properly and never allowed a bath. How often have I seen it
in villages and country towns, and have bought the poor little
half-starved bird to rescue it. And scores of times I have seen
it in London,--tiny boxes, in which the bird's feet are so clogged
with dirt that his little toes drop off, and he has to peck up his
food in the filth in the cage, and to squeeze his neck through
the hole in the wire to get the drop of dirty water. The con-
dition of the majority of birds so kept is deplorable, as also their
lot in too many bird-dealers' shops. How can it be otherwise if
there are many hundreds of birds to tend and keep clean ? A
small army of cleaners would be required to keep them properly,
and an experienced ornithologist to regulate their diet. It is
short-sighted policy in a dealer, for he not only injures the stock

THE NESTING OF THE HAWFINCH.

Coccothrausles vulgaris.
By W. E. Teschemakek, B.A.
The Hawfinch, with its robust physique and iron consti-
tution, has all the appearance of being a bird of the Northland:
one might expect to find it in the great Siberian forests in
company with the Waxwing and the Pine Grosbeak. As a
matter of fact, however, it is found in greatest numbers in
Southern Europe, ranging from the Atlantic to the Black Sea ;
it is rare in Northern Russia and Scandinavia, and in the far
East gives place to a subspecies, C. japonicus. South of the
Mediterranean it is found, though only in small numbers, in
Algeria and Tunisia. In Great Britain it nests in every county
south of the Border, except Cornwall, hardly ever in Scotland
and never in Ireland. Thus we may infer that this species likes
a warm climate and a generous diet and has not proved itself
very adaptive to other conditions, which is a matter for some
surprise seeing that the Grosbeaks, as a family, are able to
adapt themselves to almost any climate. For instance of three
American species, the Evening Grosbeak, the Rose - breasted
Grosbeak and the Yellow-bellied Grosbeak, the first is found
in the silent forests of the remote North-west, where the hardy
trapper and 'prospector' have never ventured to set foot, the
second in the States and the third is a tropical bird.
The Hawfinch is a bird of most irregular distribution and
of peculiar roving habits -- a wildern creature, rejoicing in its wild-
ness. Here to-day, it is gone to-morrow ; one year it will breed in
a district in some numbers : the next, not one nest will be found
there. As it is to-day, so it has apparently always been. In an
old work dealing with the birds of Sussex, as observed during
the first half of the last century, I find the following note:--"Of
uncertain occurrence, being not unusual during some years and

comparatively rare in others : is generally observed about autumn
when haws, cherries and stone fruit are in season. Bred in
Stanmer Park during the summer of 1847, The young after they
had left the nest frequented the neighbourhood of the gardener's
cottage and were all caught by his children in brick traps baited
with peas." Old and young generally seem to stay in their nest-
ing locality until well on in the winter but, as soon as the food
supply becomes scanty, away they go, wandering about the
country with others of their race in scattered bands and next
year selecting quite a different locality for a summer residence,
possibly in deference to the well known principle that one should
never repeat a success. One of these flocks, which foraged in
the neighbourhood of Paignton during the latter part of last
winter, numbered some thirty individuals and was by far the
largest gathering of this species that I have ever heard of in this
county.
It is unnecessary to give any technical details of plumage
because these may be found in any of the bird-books, but one
point may be noted in respect of which the bird-books (or some
of them) are misleading. I refer to the colour of the beak in
the breeding season, which is stated by Howard Saunders to be
"leaden blue at the base, dull black at the tip; in winter pale
horn-colour." Morris says: " Bluish in summer, the tip dusky."
My attention was called to this matter by an exhibitor who came
to have a look at my birds one summer. Such is the popularity
of Teignmouth as a watering-place that every season a good
many aviculturists find themselves in my neighbourhood and
frequently give me a look up. (One season I had forty-five
visitors besides some who called in my absence). Some of these
are members of our Society, some are artizans, and others do
not favour me with their names ; they come from the unknown
and pass away into the unknown. This particular aviculturist
bowed himself in and, after introducing his wife, flattered me
with the information that he had seen my name in an advertise-
ment. As a general rule my visitors are not specialists and do
not cross-examine me very severely, so that I geneially come
through the ordeal without exposing my ignorance too palpably.
But this time I was in the hands of a specialist in British birds

Mr. W. K. Teschemaker,
from an exhibition point of view-- my weakest point, because I
rarely keep birds in cages. I got through the first series of
questions fairly well but I felt that disaster was at hand. When
we came to the Hawfinches my examiner suddenly said :-- " Have
you noticed the colour of the beak of a Hawfinch in summer?"
Iliad not; but I plunged, following Saunders, and I was lost.
Quite wrong," said my friend severely, " it is entirely black, and
if it is not black the bird is not in breeding condition." Subse-
quent experience has led me to think that my visitor was
right; in the spring the beak becomes black in patches, and later
in the season I have seen the beak almost entirely black. Of
course the exposure of my ignorance was galling but I was some-
what consoled to find, on my next visit to the Natural History
Museum, that the beaks of the pair of birds in the case illus-
trating the nesting of this species had not been painted black
and, when in the Central Hall I came across a clutch of Creeper's
eggs with the statement that this species nests " in holes," I felt
better.
I quite expect to hear that the Hawfinch has been bred,
though I do not myself know of an instance. There are, however,
certain difficulties to be overcome. One of these is its remarkable
shyness which would probably prevent it from bleeding in an
aviary not provided with suitable covert. Another is its sullen,
savage disposition which has made it unpopular with aviarists.
There is a rough and ready method of testing the disposition of
any species which I have found very useful and, for a rule of
thumb method, singularly accurate, namely, to take the bird in
one's hand and try if it will bite. If it bites even a little, watch
it very carefully when turned in amongst other birds ; if it bites
hard, never associate it with other birds. Grosbeaks show re-
markable differences of disposition when tested in this way. Not
long since I handled half-a-dozen Blackdieaded Grosbeaks (//.
vielanocephalus) and could not induce one of them even to nibble ;
subsequent experience has proved the species to be absolutely
peaceable despite its large size and formidable beak. But the
bite of the Hawfinch is a thing one can never forget--a sort of
super-bite: it hangs on like a bull-dog and generally draws
blood. And the Hawfinch lives up to its bite. Should any

will assuredly depart with a broken wing or leg and, even when
Hawfinches aie kept apait from other birds, it is extremely
difficult to induce a pair to live together peaceably. The first
pair which I kept under these conditions had not been more than
a week or two in their aviary before the male killed the female
and, when I obtained another female, the latter promptly polished
off the male. I released this female and obtained two young
birds in the autumn of 1909 which settled down comfortably
together but did not breed in the following year, either because
they were immature or because they had not yet overcome the
constitutional nervousness of their race.
The division in which I have kept my Hawfinches for the
past few years is not part of the aviary ; it used to be a path
surrounding the aviary and in the early days I used to sit and
watch the birds from this path but, as I never have time for such
luxuries now, I wired it in. It is about 35ft. long, 8ft. wide and
12ft. high. Being just under my bedroom window I am always
able to have an early peep at the Hawfinches when desired,
which is fortunate because this and the late evening are the only
periods of the day when this species shows any activity ; with its
dipping flight, large size and handsome colouring it is far too
conspicuous a bird to go abroad at mid-day.
I11 mid-March I heard the male singing and this-- I may
remark--is not a song that is heard every day. It is distinctive
though impossible to describe; its shrill whistling call-note is
also unlike that of any other bird. An old gardener, of whom I
once made enquiries concerning this species, asked me if I meant
the bird " which squeaked like a mouse." After hearing the song
of the male I kept a close eye on the Hawfinches, for I said to
myself that an amorous Hawfinch would be a thing worth seeing
--indeed it seemed hard to imagine that this, the most sullen,
taciturn and unsociable of all British finches, ever could flirt. On
the nth April my patience was rewarded. The advances came
from the lady who, standing facing the male with drooping wings,
commenced to swing her body from side to side uttering a low
crooning note and then ventured to gently nibble the tip of the
male's beak. The male stolidly stared at his partner and appeared

to be considering whether he ought to submit to such an indignity
or whether it would not be more consonant with his dignity to
give the amorous maiden one in the eye.
After this my log-book records but little concerning the
Hawfinches until the 28th May, when I found that they had pulled
up some coarse grass in a corner of their enclosure. On the 29th
they cairied some of this grass to a fork of a Py vacant his about
nine feet from the ground ; the male displayed a little, swinging
his body to and fro, as a Goldfinch does, and singing. O11 the
30th, I observed that the female looked queer, and on examining
her ladyship more closely came to the conclusion that she medi-
tated laying an egg. This was serious because there was no nest.
Apparently they either did not know how to construct one, being
as I have said before young birds, or else they considered that it
was part of my official duties to provide one. The only two nests
that I have seen have been large, flattened structures composed of
twigs and roots lined with finer roots and, after several attempts, I
produced something distantly resembling this type of nest and
fixed it up with wire in the position they had chosen ; as the latter
was so exposed I surrounded the nest with a screen of cupressus
and holly. Having finished my job I retired to a distance to see
what the Hawfinches would think of it. It took them a long
time to find their way through the screen but, when they did
succeed in reaching the nest, their expressions were a study.
They stood in solemn silence and gazed at that nest and gazed
again ; apparently their thoughts were too deep for words. I
must admit that it was a somewhat weird structure. However
they finally decided to accept it and soon set to work and relined
it with green grass --I wonder why.
On the 2nd June the female commenced to sit; she alone
incubated and she sat so steadily that I never got a glimpse of
the eggs. She was fed on the nest by the male and, if she ever
left it, it must have been very early in the morning or at some
time when I was not watching. I fixed up a ladder in the
adjoining enclosure and, as the latter was loftier than that con-
taining the Hawfinches, I was able to look down 011 the nest but,
even so, I was not able to see the young for several days after
they were hatched because the female refused to leave the nest.

I think that the adults must have devoured the egg-shells of
which I could not find a trace.
It was not till the 22nd that I obtained a good view of the
young which were most singular objects--three fine, healthy
nestlings, surrounded by a perfect halo of long white down, with
which the dark brown of the dorsal tract and the blackish flights
contrasted strongly ; they looked rather like young Sparrow-
hawks. I was annoyed to see that the nest, which I had fancied
so secure, had commenced to sag on one side; owing to the
situation selected by the adults it had not the advantage of what
engineers call " three-point-suspension." On the 23rd the com-
bined weight of the adults and young proved too much for the
nest, half of which fell right away, but the young with much
philosophy, squatting side by side, balanced themselves skilfully
on what remained of their home. On the 24th--one of the few wet
days of this tropical summer--so little remained of the nest that
one squab was compelled to take up a crosswise position on the
backs of the other two, and the female, when brooding them,
had to sit 011 the top of this one. This led to a tragedy. On the
morning of the 251I1 I saw the female perched beside the nest
whittling away at something. Standing beneath the nest I could
see a ghastly, distorted corpse and no sign of the other young.
In course of time one becomes hardened to these shocks so, with
philosophic calm, I fetched a ladder to bear away my dead.
However, matters were not so bad as I had thought; the weight
of its superincumbent family had caused the smallest of the
young to be impaled on one of the formidable thorns of the
Pyracanthus , the other two had lost their hold on that part of
the nest, which alone remained in situ, and had slipped down
on to the collapsed part.
The corpse was so firmly impaled that it required a good
pull to dislodge it. This was evidently what the female had
been endeavouring to do, and some idea of the strength of her
mandibles may be obtained from the fact that she had whittled
away quite half of the squab's beak, which was so stout that it
would have resisted a blunt knife. The squab weighed exacily
one ounce. Its beak (which was very large but more flattened
than that of an adult) and legs were pinkish. It was bare on

the lower neck, centre of breast, abdomen and sides ; elsewhere
it was well covered. The crown and upper back were brown ;
the rump lighter ; axillaries rufous; primaries black. Three of
the secondaries were blue-grey on the anterior margins; the
prominent white margins of the coverts formed a bar of white on
the wing. The breast, flanks and abdomen were huffish-white,
many of the feathers being tipped with brown, giving the whole
of the underparts a very distinctive mottled appearance. The
tail was very short, the three outer rectrices showing white on
the inner margins. The mottled feathering and white* ground-
colour of the breast made the young very conspicuous, even at a
little distance, and here again, as in the case of the Sprosser, I
must confess myself unable to see that the nestling plumage can
by any possibility be protective.
The young Hawfinches flew on the evening of the 26th,
and were so tame that I had no difficulty in inducing them to
pose before the camera. After a time, however, they became
even wilder than the adults, and when, about six weeks later, I
netted and brought them into the house, they severely damaged
their heads by dashing against the netting. They were reared
on gentles and green peas. Only the small, tender peas were
touched but these were consumed in great quantities.
A young bird examined on the nth August had the two
centre rectrices olivaceous, the others white on the inner margins;
the primaries, from the fifth to the ninth, had jagged blue tips ;
the secondaries blue outer margins. The greater and lesser
coverts had white margins ; the rump was yellowish with darker
tips to the feathers ; the saddle was dark brown; the head and
cheeks yellowish ; no black on the throat.

Gutter a puckeruni.
By Gerard H. Gurney, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
My pair of Coronated Guineafowls (G. pucherani ), which I
caught and brought home with me from British East Africa in
190S, have nested and reared young this year for the first time.
For some time they have had their entire liberty, wandering
about where they choose and roosting 011 the topmost boughs of
a tall fir tree, but they are naturally delicate birds and in the
winter are run into a dry shed at night, though generally out
during the day; they fly down into an enclosure to be fed, and
the nest was made in this enclosure, amongst long grass, under a
large rhubarb bush, the first egg being laid on June 2nd. The
nest was a slightly hollowed out " scrape" in the ground, with a
few pieces of bent grass in it, but was entirely hidden from prying
eyes by large rhubarb leaves hanging over it. Eleven eggs were
laid, generally one each morning, they very much resemble a
Domestic Guineafowl's egg, but are smaller, paler in colour, and
not so much spotted, neither is the shell so hard. The eggs were
taken and placed under a hen, the first one hatching on July 14th,
another the following day, the remaining nine eggs were un-
fertile. Only one of the chicks lived, the second one dying two
days after it had hatched. The survivor, when four days old,
was a beautiful little thing, covered with rich red-brown fluff, the
head striped with dark brown and white, underparts lightish.
From the first we fed it almost entirely on fresh ants' eggs,
on which it appeared to thrive, eating an enormous quantity
every day. When only twelve days old it had developed its wing
feathers to an extraordinary degree and was able to fly easily
over a wall eight feet high ; it presented a most comical appear-
ance at this time, the feathers only just beginning to appear on
its breast and neck, its wings looking far too large and developed
for its tiny body and a ridiculous little sprouting tail, sticking
straight up behind. It grew rapidly during the glorious hot
weather we had in August and spent most of its time catching
small insects amongst the long grass in its enclosure.
When a month old the blue feathers began to appear and
the bare skin 011 the neck became more distinct, though it was of

a greyish colour, not blue like the adult birds; it also refused to
roost any longer with its foster-mother in the sheltered sleeping-
place provided, but every night went up 011 to quite a high
bough and spent the night in the open. It is now practically
full-grown and nearly as large as its parents. I believe this to
be the first time this species has been bred in confinement.
The old hen Guineafowl laid six more eggs and began to sit
on August 15th. I was determined to see if she would rear them
herself, so did not take them away and I have never known any
bird sit tighter or better, and on September 8th she was walking
about followed by four beautiful chicks.
Expecting them to hatch about this date, I had, on the
previous day, removed the cock bird, fearing that he might
interfere with the young ones ; however on going to look at them
early the following morning we found that he had flown back
over the wall--both the old birds are full-winged--and was
brooding the chicks himself. He proved to be a most careful and
solicitous parent, more often brooding the young ones than the
hen.
Both old birds were very savage, flying furiously at anyone
who daie to go too near, and the hen on the slightest approach of
a possible danger, would at once collect her chicks under her ;
but alas, the hot weather changed, and the rain for which every-
one, except myself, had been longing, came, and with it a spell
of very cold, damp weather, and, one by one, when only three
days old, the little Guineafowls died off; and although we moved
them, with the old ones, into a heated dry house, it was then too
late and we lost the lot; their now fully fledged half-brother
evincing much curiosity at the little corpses of his brothers and
sisters lying on the ground.

These three are new to the collection. A fine pair of Barred
Owls ( Syrnium nebulosum ), four American Barn Owls (, Strix
flammea. perlatam ), four of the northern race of the Burrowing
Owl ( Speotyto cunicularia hypogcea ), four Blue Jays, a pair of
Golden-winged Woodpeckers and some White-fronted Doves.
The Society has for some time possessed a solitary Victoria
Crowned Pigeon, the only example of this fine group. Two more
specimens, as well as a pair of the so-called Common Crowned
Pigeon have now been acquired, bringing our stock of these
magnificent birds up to five, which we hope to increase by
breeding next year.
One of the most interesting arrivals consists of a pair of
the extremely rare and beautiful Ringed Teal (. Net Hum lorquatuni)
from South America. This is a rare species even in its own
country and is new to the Zoological Society's collection and
probably to this country. It is something like the Brazilian Teal
but much more beautiful, the male having bright chestnut-red
scapulars, pale grey flanks, metallic green wing-coverts and a
black band passing from the top of the head down the nape and
dividing into a collar round the neck. A few males of this
species reached the Berlin Gardens some few years ago but there
were no females.

Sir, -- I have to record another failure. To-day -- the 30th of August
--I have looked into a nesting-box in which another of my hen Queen
Alexandra Parrakeets had been sitting on three eggs for three weeks, only to
find one egg addled, one scratched out of the hollow in which it was laid and
quite cold, and the third squashed and half open with a young bird inside
it ready to hatch, but dead. The hen bird is a bad mother, and I suspect
her of eating her eggs, for I found some chawed shells in addition to the
three eggs. She has had two former clutches this year, and in each case
the eggs had holes eaten in them ; yet she sat well, and the same male--
which was the father of the fortnight old bird by another hen--fed her and
mated with her. HUBERT D. A STUB Y.

</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997717147058823" page_id="32659094"  page_num="38" year="" vol="">
One of the most useful features of Mr. North's book (of
which we have just received Part II. of Vol. III.) is the inclusion,
not only of a description of the nidification of the species, but
its life history, hence it is of the utmost interest and value to all
students of the avifauna of the Island Continent. It is, however,
unfortunate that those species whose nesting habits are unknown
are entirely omitted from the work, hence we have no mention
of such species of the Genus Psephotus as P. chrysoplerygius or
of Mr. North's excellent species P. cucullatus. The part just
issued concludes the Order Psittaci, and treats of several of the
Cockatoos and of those most delightful Parrakeets which are not
surpassed by any in their popularity with aviculturists.
It is strange that Australian ornithologists will persist in
calling so many of the true Parrakeets " Tories," a name that is
almost as absurd when applied to Plistes or Aprosmidus as it is
when used for the African Touracous. Inappropriate popular
names will, however, probably continue to be applied until the
end of time, even if ornithologists agree to use only those that
have a sensible meaning.
A remarkable and most regrettable fact about some of the
most beautiful Parrakeets is that they are rapidly becoming ex-
tremely scarce, though only a few years ago they were numerous.
During the present writer's stay in Australia he made many
inquiries as to the present whereabouts of the Turquoisine
(Neophema pulchella) with the result that nobody could give any
satisfactory information. The bird had been plentiful twenty
years ago and less, but for years no individual had been heard of.
Mr. North fully corroborates the opinion then arrived at that
this beautiful species is now on the verge of extinction. No
specimen has been received or heard of since 1885, though a
few years before that the species was common a few miles from
Sydney.

unknown in Western Australia at the present time, though the
type was procured there. But this species has always been rare,
and possibly it is not scarcer now than formerly.

of the species naturally form the bulk of the matter contained in

THE GIZA ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS. *
The Report of the Giza Zoological Gardens for the year
1910, being compiled on the lines of the previous reports, enables
the reader to see at a glance how the year compares with pre-
vious years. We note that the number of visitors shows an
increase of over 19,000 pointing to the continued and increasing
interest taken by the inhabitants of Cairo. The number of
animals, birds and reptiles in the Gardens at the time of the
annual stock-taking was 1464, representing 391 species, and is
the largest number that have hitherto been on exhibition.
Among the birds the more notable additions during the
year were six White-headed Oxbirds ( D . dine nielli), three Bifas-
ciated Laiks ( A . alaudipes ) and two Red-billed Hornbills (A.
erythrorhynchus ), one Savigny's Bearded Vulture ( Gypaetus bar-
batus ossifragus), three Crowned Saudgrouse (Zb corotiatus), none
of which, except the Bearded Vulture and Hornbills, have been
on exhibition in the London Gardens. The number of species
of birds bred in the Gardens was not very great; the most
important being two Crowned Pigeons (Or. coronata ) and two
Senegal Stone Curlews ( CEdicnenius senegallus) , and we fancy
this is the first time that any Stone Curlew has successfully
reared its young in captivity. The Griffon Vultures and the
Lark-lieeled Cuckoo ( Centropus ) laid eggs but failed to hatch
them.
The Report also includes many interesting details respect-
ing the food and the expenses, as well as a list of scientific papers
concerning the collection, which have been published by various
authors during the year.

the four numbers under review the article of greatest interest is
that of Miss Turner on the nesting of the Bittern in Norfolk
during the past summer. This marsh-loving bird has not nested
in this country since 18S6, while the last nest of what may be
termed the original stock was found in 1868. On this occasion
we are glad to say the birds successfully reared their young,
photos of which and of the nest are given. Early in August they
left their breeding quarters and we must hope for their return
next 3 r ear. Other articles deal with the late Mr. Robert Service,
the Recovery of Marked Birds and numerous short notes, which
we have no space to notice in detail.

By Dr. A. G. Butlkk.
All aviculturists who have attempted to breed insect-eating
birds have spoken of the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient
quantity of suitable food for this purpose : this is partly due to
want of knowledge of those insects, their larvae, or pupae, which
are suitable for the purpose ; partly to ignorance of the best
methods of obtaining these in abundance. I therefore propose
in the present paper to indicate first what kinds to select and
then to explain how they can be acquired.
Spiders are not true insects, but all of them are much
sought after by insectivorous birds and are greedily devoured :
they are moreover the best, medicine for ailing birds and have
saved the lives of not a few of my pets when they were too ill
to be tempted by any other food. Four or five of the common
garden spider (Epeira diademala), or failing these two or three
examples of a common greenhouse spider (Fegenaria atrica), or
even the repulsive looking house-spider (71 domestical) with its
wide spread of legs will speedily restore a sickly bird to health
and activity.
Birds have not the slightest fear of spiders, but rush upon
them with the greatest eagerness as soon as they are offered,
even that ugly little beast (Dysdera ca?nb&amp;gt;idgei) being most
attractive to avian taste. Harvest-spiders ( Phalangidea ) are also
accepted, although not with the same enthusiastic pleasure.
When one considers that the food of spiders consists
entirely of insects, one can understand that when eating an
Arachnid a bird gets insect-food in a concentrated form ; there-
fore, although I was scoffed at some years ago for speaking of
spiders as a sort of bird's Bovril, I don't think the comparison
was in the least degree a ridiculous one.

Practical Bird-Keeping.
Of the Mvriopoda, which also are not insects, the centi-
pedes are eaten with avidity, but the millipedes are refused.
The broad centipede (Lithobius forficatus) is sometimes met with
when separating a cask of flower-pots for greenhouse work, but
these little animals are not so abundant as to be of great im-
portance to the aviculturist; nevertheless they should not be
thrown away when much food is needed for rearing young birds.
Of the Thysanura the abundant little so-called "Silver-
fish " (. Lepisma ) may often be obtained in abundance under boxes
or tins or even in the mealworm-pan, and though it is so active
and brittle that it cannot well be picked up and offered to a bird,
it may be brushed into a basin and the latter placed in an aviary
when the whole collection will speedily be devoured.
Mayflies ( Epliemeridce ) and caddis-worms ( Phryganeidce ) are,
as is well-known, favourite food for all insect-eating creatures,
the latter can be obtained in a dried form from Germany and
from some of the English dealers, but in this case they must
be scalded before they can be used as they are very hard when
received in their tinned form. The smaller Dragon flies are
eaten, but are not easily obtained in quantity.
Termites or so-called White-ants would be excellent food
for our pets if we could only get them preserved in quantities :
they are one of the plagues of tropical countries and could easily
be collected and dried for importation as bird-food, but nobody
seems to have had sufficient enterprise to make use of them.
Earwigs ( Euplexoptera ) are well known to be acceptable and
these can easily be obtained in the autumn, by crumpling up
paper and ramming it into a flower-pot inverted over the sticks or
stakes used as supports for Delphiniums, Dahlias, &amp;c. Remove
the pots to an aviary or large cage and open the paper, when the
insects will drop out in numbers and form a pleasing variety in
the dietary of your insectivors.
The Orthoptera generally are acceptable to birds, but in
this country few can be secured even in fair quantities ; perhaps
grasshoppers are most numerous, but only in certain districts,
while crickets seem only to abound in the kitchens of old houses:
yet why locusts, which are a plague in the tropics, are not dried,
deprived of their legs, heads, and wings, and ground into meal

as food for cage-birds, is a mystery : surely they would pay for
importation. In meadows of long grass where grasshoppers
occur, they might he swept up with a butterfly-net, emptied into
glass bottles, and turned out for the delectation of an aviary of
insectivorous birds. This reminds me of the value of the
entomological sweeping net, of canvas on an iron ring, for
collecting quantities of small insects, their larvae, and spiders,
from weed-filled ditches and hedgerows: sweeping the herbage
with a net of this kind one secures a vast store of insect-life in a
very short time ; and, for Warblers and other small birds, a
collection of this kind is invaluable.
The Cockroaches ( Blattarice ) are excellent food for all in-
sectivorous birds, although some birds will only accept them in
the very young larval stage; the commonest form Periplaneta
a?nericaua may be easily captured in hundreds with the ordinary
so-called beetle-trap. In Madagascar a gigantic species is com-
mon and if imported and bred in a greenhouse would doubtless
be most useful for feeding the larger species such as Mynahs,
Bower-birds, Crows, See. It is a most curious insect with feet
padded like those of a cat, for which reason I gave it the generic
name FEluropoda ; the largest specimens are from 69 to 73
millimetres in length, and 31 to 34 millimetres in width at the
widest part of the body, or the size of a tolerably large mouse.
The plant-bugs, with the exception of the Aphides (green-
fly) are not generally much liked by birds, but there are excep-
tions, as in the case of the so-called Water-boatmen ( Corisidce )
of which vast quantities are imported from Mexico under the
name of ''dried flies" and form an ingredient in all the best
insectivorous mixtures put upon the market. I believe these
insects are chiefly caught when flying over the water in the
evening in dense clouds ; but the presence of small fish among
them shows that they are followed by the net even after their
return to their native element. It is probable, I think, that
Cicadas would also be acceptable to birds, but I have had no-
opportunity of testing this : the Membracidce to which family our
cuckoo-spit (frog-hopper in its adult form) belongs, are certainly
eaten when offered, and I believe that some birds will even eat
mealy-bugs ( Coccidce ).

Practical Bn d- Keeping.
As already stated, the smaller Dragon-flies are relished and
*doubtless the larger forms, when they can be captured, are also
devoured by the more powerful insectivores ; most Neuropterous
insects are probably suitable tor food, but I should think the
lace-winged fly ( Chrysopa ) with its slow fluttering flight, metallic
golden eyes, and most offensive smell would be an exception,
which is just as well, seeing that its larva subsists entirely upon
plant-lice.
Of all insects, probably the Depidoptera (Butterflies and
Moths) are most appreciated by birds, as caterpillars, chrysalides,
and perfect insects, but to this general rule there are numerous
exceptions of which, in the case of the more abundant species, it
may be well to indicate a few : --Spiny caterpillars, like those of
the Vanesscs , as for instance those of the Peacock Butterfly and
the small Tortoiseshell (which abound on stinging-nettles) are
naturally regarded as objectionable, but tlieir more or less metallic
chrysalides are eaten, as also are the perfect insects. I however
object to destroying these beautiful and useful butterflies when
abundance of the far commoner and noxious white butterflies:--
Gaiioris b/assiccs, rapes, and napi can always be captured with
ease in our gardens after they have settled for the night upon
white flowers or pale leaves. I often go round my garden in the
evening and pick up cpiite a number of these (the only really
mischievous butterflies which we have and the least beautiful)
and give them to my Hangnests and other birds which will
accept them. This year, when our wild birds have been hard
put to it to find sufficient food out of doors, I have frequently
seen Sparrows hunting down these butterflies, snipping off their
wings and eating the bodies.
Hairy caterpillars like those of the Tiger and Ermine
Moths ( Arctiidce ) are not generally accepted, although the Crows,
typical Thrushes and Cuckoos will eat them, the two first rubbing
them backwards and forwards first to remove the hair, but the
larvae of the Buff-tip moth (. Pygcera bucephala) which often is so
abundant that it strips limes and sallows of their foliage is re-
jected by all excepting our Cuckoo, which eats it with avidity.
Many of the larger and commoner stick-caterpillars
( Geomeiridce) are refused ; not, I believe, on account of their

resemblance to pieces of twig, nor because they are unpleasant
to the taste, although the latter may partly explain the rejection
by some birds of the caterpillar of the Swallow-tailed moth
(Urcipteryx sambucaria) when it has been feeding upon Irish ivy,
but rather because they are extremely tough. I have seen some
of my birds trying to break up caterpillars of this character for a
considerable time and giving it up in the end as hopeless; only
birds with powerful bills are successful. The black caterpillar of
the Brindled beauty (Bislon hirtaria), by no means a pretty moth
by the way, is easily collected from the trunks of lime-trees, but is
one of the toughest of its kind. On the other hand the little cater-
pillars of the V.-moth (Halia vauaria) a gooseberry pest, are a
favourite food of the Titmice; indeed I once watched a Blue-tit
for quite half an hour feeding its young upon these caterpillars
alone : on the other hand the spotted larvae of the common
Gooseberry-moth (Abraxasgrossulariata) are rejected with disgust
by most birds, as well as by lizards, frogs, and spiders, although
Mr. Page says that he has seen his Weavers eating them : the cry-
salides of the same moth, with their wasp-like colouring are also
generally refused, but the moths are occasionally accepted and my
male Blue-bird was very fond of them. In like manner the cater-
pillars of the large white butterfly (Ganoris brassicce) are generally
refused, but the chrysalides and perfect insects devoured without
hesitation. Size does not seem to alarm birds, for a Blue-tit in
one of my aviaries captured in the air a full-sized female of the
Poplar hawk-moth (Smerinthus populi ) tore off the wings and
carried it to a perch to eat it; neither does the so-called terrify-
ing attitude of certain caterpillars of hawk-moths seem to affect
the nerves of birds to the slightest extent. The caterpillars of
the Puss-moth, common on willows and poplars, is approached
with caution by all birds excepting the Tits, which are familiar
with it and recognize it as providing an excellent meal ; un-
doubtedly its very bizarre shape and colouring and the existence
of two tentacles on the last segment from which it can eject an
acid liquid renders most birds wary of it.
No doubt a cabbage-field is the best place in which to
seek for edible caterpillars, those of the common Cabbage-moth
(Mamestra brassicce ) in various shades of green and brown, some

of the Apatueas and the velvety green catterpillar of the small
White butterfly ( Ganoris raped) being always in evidence.
Caterpillars of the Dot-moth (Mamestra persicariee) common
on the fronds of the well known male and female ferns are always
greatly relished ; they vary in ground-tint from lavender greyish,
through chocolate and clay-colour to green, but may always be
recognized by the dark crescentic markings on the anterior
segments.
Wood-boring caterpillars are not generally liked, although
the larger Thrush-like birds aud probably the Crows will eat
them ; they, however, render the cage offensive for some time
afterwards : they should prove excellent food for Black Cockatoos,
since the latter eat them in Australia with relish. The perfect
insect of the Wood-leopard moth ( Zenzera eesculi) is more often
than not refused by birds, I think because of its rather startling
coloration reminding one a little of a Pierrot; but all the small
brown night-motlis as well as the more or less metallic Plusicz
including the Burnished-brass moth are accepted at once.
The languid white caterpillars of some of the Ghost-moths
(. Hepialidee ), which I have found in quantities feeding on the
roots when removing Peonies from one part of my garden to
another, are very much relished by all insectivorous birds.
The leaf-rolling larvae of Pearl-moths ( Pyralides ) are always
eaten, as are those of the more typical Micro-Tepidoptera the
Tortrices and Tineina , including even those of the common
clothes-moths.
Most two-winged flies ( Diptera ) are devoured in all their
stages and it is well known that maggots of the common blue-
bottle fly are well worth breeding in meat and, after sconring
by keeping for a day or so in sand, form excellent food for
rearing young birds. It might be supposed that Sun-flies, Rat-
tailed flies and Bee-flies from their more or less near resemblance
to wasps, honey-bees, and humble-bees, w&amp;apos;ould be refused, but in
the case of the two first at any rate this is not the case, though it
is a sin to destroy the first (the larvae of which destroy plant-
lice) while the last, which fly like Humming-birds, are not easily
-captured : but Rat-tailed flies (. Eristalis tenax ) are easily picked

off Michaelmas daisies and, in spite of their angry buzzing, are
taken at once from the fingers and eaten.
By far the greater number of the beetles ( Coleoptera ) may
be given to birds, but the common Stag-beetle (_ Lucanus cervus)
which, when approached by a bird throws itself into an attitude
of defence, raising itself on its front legs and holding its powerful
mandibles wide open, makes its opponent very cautions; I think
any of the Crows would be able to master it, but a Thrush seems
only able to fling it on its back and then cannot break through
its horny covering. The Soldier and Sailor beetles ( Telephoridce )
are not relished by birds, nor are the tiny metallic blue Cabbage
beetles (. Phesdon brassicce ) of which I once had several ounces sent
to me to test my birds with ; these beetles have a strong sour
smell like red ink and I did not wonder at their rejection.
Bloody-nosed beetles and Oil-beetles would also probably prove
equally objectionable. Larvae of Cockchafers are eaten, but they
make a disgusting mess of a cage in which they are broken up.
Although some of the Carabidce such as Carabus violaceus
have a most offensive odour, and on that account would probably
be generally refused in the beetle stage, their larvae, obtained
when digging up the earth, are greedily accepted, and I found
them most useful when my young Ouzels were being reared.
Pterostichus madidus, though a liard-shelled beetle, is eateir by
some of the larger birds.
The smaller Rove-beetles ( Staphylinidee ) are, I should
think, generally accepted ; but it would need a strong bird to
tackle the Devil's Coach-horse ( Staphylinus olens ) which always
curls up its tail and opens its jaws when touched, a really terrify-
ing attitude, and I should not expect it to be a tasty morsel.
The larvae of Spring-back beetles (. Elateridce ), which some-
what resemble mealworms and are generally known as wire-
worms, are much liked by all insectivorous birds ; as of course
are the true mealworms ( Tenebrio ) of the family (Te?iebrio?iidce),
and the hairy larvae of the Bacon-beetle ( Dermestes lardarius) of
the family Dermestidce the perfect insect being also eaten with
pleasure.
Of the four-winged flies (, Hymenoptera ) I do not think birds

have any instinctive dread, for we know that, in tropical countries,
many weak species build their nests, for protective purposes,
close to the nests of the most virulent wasps ; still the number
of birds which feed upon bees and wasps is limited; although
the grubs of all wasps are recognized as excellent food for rear-
ing young birds; the Laughing Thrushes after breaking the
stings against their stiff tail-feathers eat wasps with impunity,
while the Bee-eaters probably crush the bodies in their bills
before swallowing examples of Hyvienoptera , but most insec-
tivorous birds leave these insects severely alone, and this should
cause our friends who make too much of mimetic resemblance
to pause before they assume that a wasp-like or bee-like aspect
in another insect is invariably a protection, when we who keep
birds know that it is nothing of the kind ; it may be some pro-
tection against a bird which is not hungry, but not against one
which is pressed for food : a hungry bird investigates closely.
Ants are well-known to be excellent food, both in the
pupal and perfect stage, and nests of the red ant (Formica rufa)
common in many woods, may be removed entire in a sack for
the benefit of the inhabitants of a large outdoor aviary.
Sawflies ( Ten th i ed in idee) are generally rejected by birds in
all stages, although their larvae much resemble those of Lepidop-
terous insects ; they have, however, the front segments rather
more swollen and the cocoons are tough and paper-like as a
general rule.
The smaller Crustacea and Mollusca are well known
to be a favourite diet with many soft-feeders, also, of course,
earthworms ; the latter should always be offered to all Thrush-
like birds when nesting, as they are easily obtained in quantity
and with very little trouble as a general rule.

By Philip H. Bahr, M.A., M.B., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The following is a short account of some experiences with
a limited number of native birds during a fifteen months stay in
the Fiji.
Several species were successfully brought home to Eng-
land, amongst which the finch (E&amp;gt; ythrura pealei), the lory
(Calliptilus solitat ius) and the parroquet. (. Pyrrliulopsis taviuensis )
are, I believe, the first to be brought to this country alive.
Fiji is but poorly supplied with bright-coloured birds, and
in this respect the subject of the accompanying plate, so admir-
ably executed by Mr. Goodchild, affords an exception.
The Parrot, Peale&amp;apos;s, or lure-tailed Finch is the proud
possessor of a native name, Oigi (pronounced Ng-ghi-ng-ghI), a
term which appears to be applied loosely by the Fijians to any
small bird, but to this species in particular.
It is a curious fact that the Fijian knows nothing or cares
little for any bird ; the paucity of native names testifies to this
fact; consequently but little assistance can be gained from natives
by those anxious to collect or trap birds.
The plumage of these birds is an admixture of blue, green
and red, a livery also adopted by the two more familiar species of
parrot, ( Pyrrliulopsis splendens and Calliptilus solitarius ), peculiar
to these islands.
The Fiji group comprises nearly 250 islands of all sizes in
many of which the physical conditions are extremely variable.
This finch confines its range to the three largest, Viti Eevu,
Vanua Levu and Taveuni ; on the first-named island it is an

Mr. Philip H. Bahk,
extremely common and familiar bird, and its numbers do not
appear to have suffered from the attentions of the Mongoose
which is responsible for the extinction of many forms of life on
the islands to which it was introduced some twenty-five years
ago.
It is a familiar species, frequenting the gardens of the
European residents, to whom it is known as the Croton Finch
from its partiality to those bushes.
In their natural state it feeds to a great extent on grass
seeds, especially a most pernicious kind, well known to every
inhabitant of these islands. This seed is provided with a
long terminal spine which works its way into every article of
clothing and constitutes one of the curses of the colony. In the
months of March and April they frequent the rice fields, tilled
by the imported Indian coolies, and are then said to be caught
in great numbers.
During my stay in these islands, however, it had always
been my intention to procure as large a number of these birds as
possible. One day an Indian brought six of these birds in a
basket and offered them for sale. They had evidently been
starved for some time and a few died almost immediately. One
survived, and him we used as a call bird with some considerable
success. In the absence of any other practical means a sparrow
trap was erected, consisting of the baby's bath propped up with
a stick, under which seed was spread, and our captive was placed
in an improvised cage alongside as a lure ; a string was then run
from the prop of the trap to some handy window in the bungalow.
By these simple means we soon caught a few more ; the bath,
however, proved unsatisfactory in many ways, and was replaced
by a more serviceable wooden framework covered with fine mesh
wire and provided with a door at one side through which the
prisoner could be with safety abstracted. This proved a great
success, and, during the months of September and October, the
bag was swelled by additions of two, and sometimes three or
more Finches every day; my wife becoming an adept at working
the trap.
During this time the greater number were young birds
accompanying their parents in family parties; they were nil-

suspicious and were consequently easy to capture. The plumage
of these young birds is uniformly green, with a small spot of red
colouring situated at the base of the bill--on one occasion three
were caught in the trap at once.
During the months of December and January they were in
full moult, this being the period of hot weather, and in these
months we had no success.
When the time came to return we had no less than forty
of these birds. They throve well in a roomy cage made out of
old packing cases. Travelling via Sydney and Colombo (an
eight-weeks journey) no less than twenty-one arrived safely in
this country ; the only ones lost were drowned in a great storm
in the Bay of Biscay, during which the cage broke loose from its
moorings and a large wave swept the deck.
Turned into an outside flight in the middle of April they
throve exceedingly ; they seemed to have considerable difficulty
in completing their moult which had commenced at sea; how-
ever, in June they were in good condition and had commenced
nesting operations.
I11 addition to boxes, many old straw hats, the crowns of
which had been perforated by holes of various sizes, were fixed
up; a similar plan having proved successful with the new Cale-
donian Parrot Finch in the hands of Mr. Seth-Smith.
During August vigorous pairing was noted. The cock
bird then utters a peculiarly silvery drawn-out note and chases
the female, until quite exhausted she submits to his attentions.
A number of nests were built, some in hats and boxes, but others
in trees and bushes placed in the aviary for this purpose. The
nests in the boxes were domed and built of grass and dead leaves
and lined with feathers, those in the bushes were frail open
structures.
On entering the aviary 111 October to catch up the birds
for the winter, I noticed with great regret that the nests appeared
to have been ransacked by mice, which had obtained entrance
through cracks in the ground consequent on the summer drought.
The birds are now in magnificent condition and are undergoing
a partial moult of the red head-feathers. There is, however, one
specimen whose head remains a peculiar greenish-blue colour.

Mr. Philip H. Bahr,
They appear to have become thoroughly acclimatized and
feel the cold very little. Their food in captivity consists solely
of millet seed, and they require plenty of water for drinking and
bathing.
Calliptilus solitarius, the Fijian Tory, the "Kula"of the
natives, and no doubt mis-named solitarius, because it is always
seen in parties, and never singly, flying and screaming about the
cocoanut palms. In Mongooseland it is becoming extremely
rare and confines its range to belts of high trees and low lying
swampy places, where it is free from the attentions of this pre-
dacious little animal.
It is extremely abundant in some of the smaller islands,
notably Kadavu and Taveuni. Possessed of the most magnificent
plumage of scarlet and green with an erectile Elizabethian ruff,
it has every quality of becoming a charming pet.
On enquiry I learned that no success had attained any
efforts to keep them in captivity. They were said to become
very tame, but that they never lived long and died in convulsions
without any previous warning. The diet recommended was
mummy apple (pawpaw), honey or sugar water. In their wild
state they appear to feed mostly on the flowers of the cocoa-nut
palm. I quite despaired of procuring any to experiment with.
No one in the colony had any for sale; advertisements in the
local papers and appeals to the natives were unattended by any
success. In November I despatched my native assistant "Jesse"&amp;quot;
to his own island to see what he could do. He brought back
three young specimens of Pyrihulopsis splendens , and one adult
" Kula," which the natives had caught as it emerged from its.
nesting-hole. This was a magnificent specimen, but it entirely
refused to feed in captivity.
On a visit to the island of Taveuni in Dec., 1910, I was more
fortunate; one of the planters there is an ardent aviculturist
and knew of a number of nesting-holes of this species. He had,
however, not had much success himself with this species in cap-
tivity. These holes were situated low down in dead stumps
which had been left in his cocoa-nut plantation. An opening
had been cut away opposite the nest and cleverly closed up
with stones. This site was, in the majority of cases, on a level

with the ground thus explaining, in all probability, the ease with
which the Kula becomes wiped out by the Mongoose in other
localities. In one such nest we found a young bird partially
feathered 2J inches long. Though undoubtedly too young to be
removed, I attempted to rear it.
Nests are said to be very hard to find, as the old birds are
very wary about entering any hole while under observation. At
finding nests, natives are much more expert than white men.
Another bird, almost fledged, was brought in by a party of Solo-
mon Island labourers which had been sent out for the purpose.
At first I attempted to rear these young birds on honey, but they
did not take very kindly to it. One of them, however, on being
placed on the breakfast table, made a bee line for the porridge
and commenced feeding on it with great alacrity with, his brush-
like tongue. Tea with sugar and milk he absolutely could not
resist, though milk and sugar alone or Nestle's milk he was not
at all partial to. Henceforward the younger bird was fed by
means of a spoon on sweetened tea and milk, and became
very fat and grew rapidly ; porridge and gruel he would not or
could not take. The older bird became extraordinarily tame and
familiar and never attempted to fly away.
Subsequently five more young birds were brought in by a
Fijian ; they were half-starved and were being fed on mummy
apple, which did not agree with them. So infested were they
with white mites that I also became covered with these creatures
whose bites caused considerable inconvenience. Frequent baths
with dilute lysol effectually cleansed the birds of these parasites.
Though the weather was very warm they required a considerable
amount of extra heat; the youngest bird especially was never so
happy as when placed in the incubator at 97 P Falir. Of the new
arrivals I lost one, which vomited all food and died in convul-
sions. The others lived in a large cage and became very tame
and familiar. They were always lively and cheery, tumbling about
the floor quarrelling like monkeys and greeting others of their
kind with shrill cries as they winged their way over our house.
The youngest of the family came to a sad end. I had had
him for over a month and he had then become completely fledged.
One day, in its anxiety to reach the others, he fell out of the

Mr. Philip H. Bahr,
cigar box, which was his home, on to the floor, a distance of
some four feet. The fall seemed to knock all the breath out of
his body, his legs became paralysed and useless. He vomited all
food, but recovered temporarily and lingered on for another week.
I was greatly distressed at losing this bird after having succeeded
in rearing him from such an earl)&amp;apos;&amp;apos; stage.
I was told I should have considerable difficulty in bringing
these birds home via Canada in March. The hot weather was
reigning when I left Fiji. The five "Kulas" were placed in a
cage in the stern of the ship under cover. For the first week all
went well and they seemed to enjoy the ship's porridge and ship's
milk. One morning, after having crossed the line, and when
still three days from Honolulu, no less than four were seized with
cramp in their feet and one died in convulsions. There was no
heating on board ship and indeed the weather was quite warm
enough. They were taken into the cabin and placed in a drawer
where they huddled together for warmth.
After Honolulu a great storm arose and lasted three days,
during which I feared I should loose all my birds. I only man-
aged to save them by placing the four survivors in a small box
and taking them to bed with me to keep them warm. An electric
radiator was provided in the saloon, and by placing them in
front of this in the day time I managed to reach Vancouver with
three, another having died suddenly in convulsions. These
three, two with their feet hopelessly cramped, I managed to
snuggle across the Canadian Pacific. Though the temperature
outside registered twenty degrees of frost, they kept warm over
the steam-heating apparatus, and one recovered from the cramp
during the journey.
On the Lusitania a steam-heated room with a temperature
of 70* Falir. was provided, where they felt themselves quite at
home, but one more invalid died soon after reaching this country.
The two survivors have now assumed magnificent adult plumage,
with an outstanding ruff of red and green. Their beaks, which
at first were brown, became bright yellow when three months of
age. In May they underwent a partial moult of the head and
breast feathers and a complete moult in August (i.e . when eight
months old). All summer they have been kept in a large cage
in the house, and on warm days in the open.

They feed now almost exclusively on porridge, though
they are very partial to fruit, especially grapes, apples and
cherries. They partake of a warm bath daily and are extremely
lively. During the colder weather we are now experiencing I
find that they require to be placed in a warm cupboard at night.
So far they have shown no desire of breeding though they have
the appearance of being a pair. They are indeed fascinating
pets and would doubtless become very popular could they be
successfully transported to this country. The pair have been
deposited in the Zoological Gardens, and may be seen in the
parrot-house.
Of the larger parrots, I successfully kept in captivity the
following species :-- Pyrrhulopsis splendeus, P. personatus , P.
taviuensis and P. tabuensis.
Of P. spletideus I had three specimens from the island of
Kadava. On the larger islands they are now very rare and are
confined to the hill tops, having fallen an easy prey to the
Mongoose. My birds were nestlings and never became tame.
Travelling via Australia they landed in this country in full moult,
one unfortunately broke a leg in the train during transportation
from Tilbury. The weather being warm at the time I turned
them out in an outside aviary, when they apparently throve well
for about two months, but in June they all died in convulsions
within a few days of each other.
P. tabuensis. This species differs from splendens in having
a maroon-coloured head and chest in the place of scarlet. In
Fiji its range is limited to the island of Vanua Levu, there its
numbers have also been seriously diminished by the Mongoose.
They are said to be numerous on the island of Eva in the Tonga
group, whither they are supposed to have been introduced from
Fiji. I was given a fine specimen in full plumage by the
Governor, Sir Ev. itn. Thurii, K.C.M.G., and this is now in
the Zoological Gardens.
P. taviue?isis. Quite a distinct species, having a much
thicker bill, larger head and shorter tail than the aforementioned
birds. The chest is maroon-coloured and the blue nuchal collar
is lacking. They are still abundant in the unsettled parts of
Taveuni to which it is peculiar, and where the Mongoose has

fortunately not been introduced. They are noisy birds in a wild
state. Two young birds were procured in Taveuni. One died
soon after arrival in this country and the other is now in the
Zoological Gardens.
P. personatns is a local species; its range being confined
to the island of Viti L,evu. It used to be the commonest of all
the parrots in that island, but it is now on the verge of extinction,
for which the Mongoose is again responsible. I11 fact it is said
that all the individuals extant are old birds and that no young
have been reared for a considerable time. In the neighbourhood
of Suva a few are still seen in the Mangrove swamps, and several
were seen round the house after the great hurricane of March
23rd, 1910; the heads of specimens shot were covered with lice.
I kept one bird in captivity, this had been captured as a nestling
several years before. It lived for over a year, but died suddenly
a few weeks before I left Fiji. A curious point about these birds
is their remarkable goat-like smell, which is especially pungent
when kept in captivity and renders their propinquity unpleasant.
This emanates apparently from some secretion and is quite inde-
pendent of the cleanliness of their surroundings. My specimen
was in fine green and yellow plumage which, in addition to his
docility, made him a very winsome pet.
All these parrots can be easily fed on green maize, vege-
tables of various sorts and fruit; they do not take kindly to hard
food.
I made several attempts to keep the brilliantly-coloured
doves, so characteristic of Fiji, in captivity ; a recently-fledged
Chtysoena luteovirens was captured in one of the hospital wards,
and by forcible feeding with berries I managed to keep it alive
for a week.
On another occasion I winged a fine female Ptilinopus
pero7isei . which only lived a few days refusing all food whether
native berries, bananas or other fruit.
Of other Pacific birds I procured a lory (Lorius flavicerciis&amp;apos;)
and a male Westermanu's Eclectus from the Solomon Islands
and a Pacific Imperial Fruit Pigeon (Carpophaga pacified) from
Samoa, all of which are doing well.

A RED TANAGER (Pyranga rubra).
By Katharine Currey.
I kept a Red Tanager for several years, and should have
had him longer, as he was in perfect health, had he not played
the truant, opening his cage-door and flying away to a neigh-
bouring garden, where he was drowned in a watering-pot.
His successor, "Tanny II." was very tame and most in-
telligent. He sang a few bars of a sweet song and, like his
predecessor, made himself quite happy and very much at home
in a good-sized double cage that stood in a south window which
was always open, so that he was in the air all day long. He
bathed perpetually and, curiously enough, was very shy of alight-
ing on the ground. If I put any tit-bit into his cage he would
crane his neck and try to reach it from a perch and, failing this,
he would pounce on it, hurriedly returning to his perch.
" Tanny " was very quick and clever and always greeted
me, if I had been away, flying about his cage, calling loudly,
with many manifestations of joy. He was very jealous if I
attended to the other cages in the morning before liis and scolded
me well. If he needed clean water he took his drinking glass in
liis beak and shook it. Others of my birds have done the same.
Of course he soon &amp;apos;learned where the mealworms were kept, and
if anyone went anywhere near the little cask they were in he
peeped round the corner of his cage and screamed, spreading out
his glossy black tail and flirting it from side to side. I tried to
make him spend the summer in an aviary, but nothing would
induce him to leave his cage ; if he came out into the room for a
flight he hastened back to it. One corner w r as covered in over a
perch and there he loosted. His rich crimson colour, especially
bright on his head and neck, never lost its brilliancy. Well does
he deserve his name--the ' Red Bird of America.'
I fed him on egg-food, fruit and ants' eggs, with as many
insects and grubs as I could get. Mealworms he slowly chewed
into little bits in his beak--a most unpleasant proceeding. Flies
and earwigs were a great delicacy.
He died of old age, gradually losing consciousness till he
ceased to breathe. "Tanny" had a sweet disposition and loved
his home and human friends. Such bird-friends leave a gap
when they go and a bright memory behind them.

In his excellent paper on the Sprosser (Daulias philomela)
in the Aviculiural Magazine for September, Mr. Tescheniaker
gives some very interesting notes on the recorded migrations of
this bird and the Common Nightingale (Daulias luscinia).
I have collected and observed birds in the Sudan for eleven
years (1901 --1911), and my experience of these two species has
been as follows.
Sprossers annually arrive in Khartoum in large numbers
at the beginning of September, and throughout that month and
the first half of October they are to be seen under bushes and
among the lime trees in nearly every garden in the town. They
are exceedingly tame, keeping principally to the ground, and hop-
ping away under cover rather than flying when approached. They
have a harsh, ' churring' alarm note. Many of them arrive in a
weak and exhausted condition and, judging from the number of
their feathers seen lying about, frequently fall victims to cats.
O11 three or four occasions I have known them enter houses.
About the middle of October their numbers decrease, and I have
110 note of them later than October 28th, on which date I shot a
specimen in 190S. Their disappearance is then complete until
the next September, and they seem to winter south of the Sudan
altogether. At any rate, I have never come across them after
this, though I have collected on many trips, as far south as
Mongalla on the White Nile, south to Fazogli on the Blue Nile,
in the Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, in Kordofau, and on the Red
Sea coast. I have never seen a single Sprosser in the spring,
either in the Nile Valley or on the Red Sea coast--our two great
migration routes -- and my belief is that this species returns
north 011 a totally different line, perhaps west of the Sahara.
Daulias luscinia , the Common Nightingale, hardly seems
to pass along this part of the Nile Valley at all. In eleven years
I have only obtained one example, a female, shot on the Bahr-
el-Ghazal River 011 January 12th, 1907. On the Red Sea Coast
near Suakin, where I have collected in the spring when Black-
caps, Barred and Garden Warblers, Thrushes, Chats, Redstarts,

Bluethroats, etc. were all passing northwards, I have never seen
a Nightingale at all.
As to the passage of these two species through Egypt I
may quote that very close and reliable observer Mr. M. J. Nieoll.
" Daulias philomela. I have only twice met with the Sprosser
"Nightingale in Egypt. On May 5th, 1907. I watched an
" example perched on a wire fence in the Zoological Gardens,,
"and on November 1st, 1908, I obtained a specimen at Giza.
"The latter example had both feet considerably swollen, and
"this probably had retarded its passage southwards."
"Daulias luscinia. Nightingales begin to arrive in Giza
" towards the end of March, and for a fortnight they abound.
" Great numbers frequent the Zoological Gardens, and I have
"seen as many as fifteen together close to the verandah of my
"house. In the autumn I have only met with this species on
" three occasions. I think it is probable that the birds follow a
"different route on their way south from that taken on the
"passage northwards in spring."
To sum up these records :
I. Egypt. Common Nightingales ( D . luscinia&amp;apos;) arrive in large
numbers in the spring, passing north, but wherever they
come from they do not seem to come down the Nile Valley
past Khartoum. The Sprosser {_D. philomela ) is a com-
paratively rare bird in Egypt. There is no appreciable
southward migration of either Nightingale through Egypt
in the autumn.
II. Sudan. Sprossers ( D. philomela ) arrive at Khartoum in
large numbers in the autumn, rest for a while, and then
disappear, but these birds are not noticed in any quantities
passing through Egypt on the way. Their return migra-
tion in the spring does not seem to passthrough the Sudan
at all. and must, I think, follow a route west of the Sahara.
Daulias luscinia is only a rare straggler in the Sudan part of
the Nile Valley, and the large numbers which pass through
Egypt in spring do not appear here previously. Possibly
they work up the west coast and spread across Africa
north of the Sahara before crossing the Mediterranean.
But the facts may be more useful than conjectures!

By Evelyn Trenow.
Biids and animals will generally use their weapons of
offence or defence at the time of capture, either from a sense of
fright or in their endeavours to make escape from their captors,
but, until they are more or less used to their altered surround-
ings, it is unusual for them to turn their attention to even their
natural enemies or prey. Thus, the newly-caught Owl will
ignore the mouse running around its cage in its search for
liberty, and the stoat and rat will glare ferociously at one another
for some time before the inevitable battle begins.
If, however, one may judge from the following, it would
appear that the Great Tit, although difficult to keep alive in
captivity, is the most self-possessed of live things, at all events
of the feathered sort, at the moment of its acquaintance with its
prison.
A desire to add some smaller British birds to an aviary
some years since induced me to set traps of various sorts on the
snow-covered ground. The birds were feeding voraciously on
anything they could find and were easily caught. One fall of
the sieve --and the old sieve trap wants a lot of beating -- added a
Chaffinch, a Greenfinch, two Sparrows and a Great Tit to a good
morning's bag. These were all turned into a large cage to be
sorted out as soon as catching had finished for the day, when
those unlikely to live in captivity were to be released.
Some earlier occupants of the cage, which had arrived but
half-an-hour or so before, included a few Blue Tits. These had
been dashing about wildly trying to escape, but at the time the
Great Tit and his fellow prisoners of the sieve were introduced,
were resting exhausted on the lower perches.
The Great Tit, however, had no two minds concerning his
mission in life, whether in a cage or outside, for he straightway
made for the top perch, balanced himself there for a few seconds,
then descended with a swoop on to one of the Blue Tits, burying
his beak in its skull. The Blue Tit of course was no more, and
the fear of another similar performance obtained for the Great
Tit his immediate freedom with the opportunity of continuing in
a wider sphere his craze for cerebral investigation.

THE LC.B.A. SHOW.
I. FOREIGN BIRDS.
By Frank Finn.
The show of P&amp;apos;oreign Birds at the London Cage Bird
Association's Exhibition -- November 24th - 27th--was far the
finest of any I have seen at the Horticultural Hall, both as
regards the number and the quality of the exhibits; the judge
was Mr. H. D. Astley.
Parrots were not numerous, but good ; in the class for
Budgerigars, Love-birds and Hanging Parrakeets, all exhibits
were in perfect form. Mr. Townsend's exquisite Blue-crowned
Hanging Parrakeet (Lot iculusga/gulas) took first ; Black-cheeked
Love-birds second and third, and a good pair of Yellow Budgeri-
gars fourth ; equally fine greens had to be content with v.li c.
There were other birds in the class, and it seems to me very hard
on Budgerigars to make them compete with such birds as Loriculi,
which ought to go in the Lory class, being soft-food eaters,,
although not true Lories.
In the class for other Parrakeets, Mr. Ezra's beautiful
lutino Ring-neck only got "very highly commended," much to
some people's surprise, it being so rare an exhibit; if its abnormal
yellow colour was the objection, this should have had no weight,
as white Javas, blue and yellow Budgerigars are allowed to pass
muster. There should really Ire a class for abnormally coloured
prize birds, or these might go in the same class as Foreign
Hybrids, which are never numerous. To return to the Parra-
keets : first went to a Brown's (, Platycercus browni), second to Mr.
Maxwell's Elegant, and third to a very nice Blue-crowned Conure^
shown by Mr. S. Williams. M. Pauwel's Uvean Parrakeet only
got fourth; yet, though not so lively as some of the others, it
was in good form. There were only two entries in the Lory
Class, a nice Ceram Lory (A. gat ruins) shown by Mr. Mackenzie,
and a pair of Dark-throated Lorikeets, not in show form, as
their tails were rough.
In the class for other Parrots a lien Everett's (TonygnatJms
everetti) took first, a Meyer's second, though there was a fine
Hawk-head in the class which only got fouith, to say nothing

of the rare Amazon ( Chrysolis ochroptera ) ; both these last were
shown by Mrs. K. L. Miller. C. ochroptera is very like the Blue-
fronted of which a specimen was also shown ; but it has the blue
front very pale and the beak whitish, not black. The Blue-front
took third ; its rare relative only v.li.c. ! These were all the
entries.
The class for common small finches was extremely well
filled and every exhibit was in good form--no less than twenty-
two cages of pretty birds. Green Avadavats were first, a cock
Cordon Bleu second, a pair of Gold-breasted Waxbills third, and
a pair of Orange-cheeks fourth. The others need no comment
here, being all of well-known species.
In the class for the rarer Waxbills, Mannikins, &amp;c., there
were a dozen entries ; a pair of Melba Finches taking first, second
also went to a Melba Finch, and third to a Crimson Finch;
fourth fell to the share of a pair of Violet-eared Waxbills. In
this class also the birds were nearly all in fine form. An Aurora
Finch was v.li.c., and the same honour fell to a third pair of
Melbas. All species of Grasshoppers, Weavers and Whydahs,
not included in the above, made a fine collection of seventeen
beautiful exhibits. The most remarkable was the beautiful
Jackson's Whydali ( Dreponoplectes jacksoni ) a black species of
rather large size with a curved tail strikingly-like that of the
common cock; in fact, cock-tailed Whydali would be the best
name for it, for in its display, which can be seen at the Zoo, the
tail is raised and expanded till it nearly meets the back-bent head,
and the resemblance to a bantam cock is most striking. The tail
of the Whydali, however, diverges above instead of below when
fully expanded. This beautiful bird, new to the show-bench,
only got third ; it was shown by Mr. Maxwell. First and second
went to Fire-tailed Finches, shown by Mr. Temple and Mr. Ross;
they were good, but it seems to me a mistake in these mixed
foreign bird classes, to give more than one prize to the same
species if this can fairly be avoided. A Tri-coloured Parrot-finch
(. Erytliruia trichroa) of Mr. Maxwell's took fourth, but it was not
in such good form as Mr. Howe's common Parrot Finch (E.
psittacea ) which only had v.li.c. Gouldian and Long-tailed Grass
Finches and Diamond Sparrows also figured in this class.

Grosbeaks, True Finches and Buntings numbered ten--a
good lot. First went to the Mexican Siskin, a pretty strangely-
marked species, black above and yellow below ; second to Mrs.
Miller's well-known lovely Rainbow Bunting; third to Mr.
Maxwell's Black-cheeked Cardinal ( Patsaria nigrigenis) ; this, I
may say for the benefit of those who have not seen it at the Zoo,
is very like the Yellow-bellied, but has black sides to the head
and a crest expanding transveisely. A beautiful Green Cardinal
took fourth ; but Mr. Pauwel's Black-and-yellow Grosbeak might
well have gone above it, as much rarer. A pair of Pintailed Non-
pareil was also shown in this class and a good pair of the true or
American Nonpareil, the lien a perfect gem. A Lavender Finch
was h.c. but should have been wrong-classed, its place being with
the rarer Waxbills, of course.
There was a splendid series of Tanagers in two classes.
One for the common sorts--Superb, Tri-colour, Violet, Scarlet,
Blue, Palm and Black--and one for all the rest. All were in good
form. I11 the first class, a Blue of the Tobago race took first, and
second and third both went to Superbs. I11 the class for rarer
Tanagers, which was much better filled, Mr. Townsend's Gold
and Green ( Calliste /lava&amp;apos;) was first, Mr. Maxwell's Pretre
Spindalis pretrii) second, while Lady Pilkington took third and
v.h.c. with a pair of All Greens ( Chlorophonia viridis ) and a Blue
and Black ( Tanagrella cyanomelaena) \ Mrs. Miller's Emerald-
spotted was fourth, and the Festive, Necklace and Maroon weie
also shown.
No less than sixteen entries were in the class for Honey-
eaters, and formed a most attractive collection, all well shown.
Mr. Ezra's Amethyst-rumped Sunbird ( Arachechthra zeylonica )
was the best of this species I ever saw in England, and well
deserved its place; there were two good Purples (. A . asialica )
which species is far easier to keep, as I found out when I brought
the first imported Sunbirds to England in 1S97 ; I only had one
Purple, which arrived safely at the Zoo, but my last of several
Amethysts died en route from Plymouth to London ; they are very
susceptible to cold. Mrs. Bouike's Purple or Yellow-legged
Sugar-bird was second ; this species, by the way, appears not to
go into undress, in spite of sometimes putting out green feathers

The L.C.B.A. Show.
--one cock that lived over a year at the Zoo recently never showed
any green. One of the Purple Sunbirds, out of colour, but very
strong and lively, was third ; it seemed to be showing off, raising
and expanding its tail. Mr. Townsend's magnificent veteran
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird was fourth, and a v.li.c. went to that
gentleman's Jerdon's Green Bulbul ( Chlotopsis jerdoni), a lovely
hen. This species is very rare in aviculture, even in India I
never saw it alive that I remember, but Mr. Harper sent a cock
to the Zoo that lived there for years, and somewhere about 1903 I
saw another hen at Abraham's establishment. The cock is like a
Gold-fronted (C. aurift oils) without the gold front; the hen is all
green but for a turquoise throat-patch. There were also two fine
cock Hardwicke's Green Bulbul (C. hardwickii ) in this class,
besides a Banana Quit, a Rufous-throated Sugar-bird--formerly
called a Tanager ( Glossopti/a ruficollis ) and two cock Dacnis, one
the common cayana, and the other I think D. nigripes, as it had
the dark (instead of flesh-coloured) feet characteristic of that
species, but it was smaller than cayana instead of larger as the
British Museum catalogue measurements make it. It was shown
by Mr. Townsend, and might well have got more than li.c. if
recognised as a distinct species, which I admit was difficult at
first sight. An Indian White-eye (Zosterops palpebrosa&amp;apos;) bred this
year by Mr. W. T. Page, and shown by Miss L- Clare, was an
interesting exhibit, and took "commended."
The next class was a fine mixed collection, being for
Shamas, Starlings, Troupials, Jays, and other hardy soft-bills.
Mr. Pauwel's Long-crested Mexican Jays were first, and deserved ;
they seem to be Cyanocitta diademata. They were smaller than
the English Jay, with daik, long-crested head, white eye-marks,
and blue body--plumage barred with black on wings and tail.
A Shama was second, and a Larger Hill Mynah third, a Glossy
Starling fourth.
The class for "all other species not comprised in the
above" was well filled, and, as might be expected, particularly
interesting and numbered nearly two dozen. A splendid Raggi's
Paradise-bird ( Paiadisea raggiana) shown by M. Pawvels, natur-
ally took first; Mrs. Miller's Japanese Redbreast ( Eri/hacus
alsahige ) was second, but I piefet red Mr. Ezra's specimen of the

same bird, which only took v.h.c. This bird is very like our
Robin, but has a short reddish tail and sooty abdomen ; Mrs.
Miller's bird was coloured in other respects just like our Red-
breast, and had a similar plump shape ; the other specimen was
darker and much slimmer, more like a Nightingale in build--I
really don't know which type is correct, however, in such a rare
bird! There were two Temmiuck's or Loo-choo Robins ( E.
homadori) in the class, of which Mrs. Miller's took v.h.c. M.
Pauwel's Malayan Fairy Blue-bird ( Irena turcosa) was third, a
most magnificent creature in its enamelled blue and velvet black
plumage ; but as the said plumage was rough on the underparts,
I should have preferred Mr. Maxwell's quaint little Coppersmith
Barbet (Xantholcema haemaiocephala), the first ever shown, though
the commonest of Barbets in the wild state, being heard even in
street trees in Calcutta. Not bigger than a Greenfinch, its green
plumage is diversified on the head and throat by scarlet and
3'ellow. It is easy enough to keep and feed on fruit and bread-
and-milk, but will not stand satoo. Besides these rarities, this
wonderful class contained a Blue-throated Flycatcher, a Cuban
Trogon, an Indian White-breasted Kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis )
a Hauxwell's Hangnest, a pair of Verditer Flycatchers (Stoparola
melanops), an Indian Yellow-cheeked Tit ( Machlolophus xantho-
genys) and a White-crested Jay-thrush. The Kingfisher was
particularly interesting, as belonging to a group rarely shown,
but was not in show plumage, the tail being rather rough ; but it
is a young bird, and will doubtless improve in steadiness. This
species feeds as much or more on land animals as fish ; in plu-
mage it is blue and chocolate with white breast. The belt and
feet are coral-red in the adult, dusky in the young.
The Foreign Hybrid class contained only two kinds, two
ugly little crosses between the Zebra Waxbill and Silver-bill,
brown with black short tails, dull yellow bills, and a Tit inter-
mediate between Pleske's Tit (Pams pleskei) and the lovely Azure
Tit (P. cyanus ) presumably a wild-bred hybrid. Pleske's Tit is
much like a Blue-tit, but paler, the Azure is white with blue
wings and tail, the latter being longer than in other members of
the genus Parus. Both are Continental.
The " Pairs for Foreign Hybrid breeding" class had five

entries, blit calls for no comment. I cannot see the use of such
a class, especially when, as hinted above, the abnormally-coloured
foreign birds badly need accommodation in a separate section.
Nor is it necessary to say anything here about the Selling class,
the exhibits being not rare, although in good condition.
The two classes for members of the L.C.B.A. only, how-
ever, contained some good birds. In the Seed-eater class M.
Pauwels won first well with a lovely Dinemelli's or White-
headed Weaver (.Dinemellia dinemelli ) a bird as big as a Song-
Thrush, white with black wings and tail and a rump vent which
should have been scarlet, but was orange. Among the soft-food
eaters the same gentleman showed one of the gems of the show,
a pair of fruit-pigeons of the genus Ptilopus, green with rich
yellow abdomen; a unique and beautiful exhibit well worthy
of the first prize they obtained, and a fit one with which to
conclude what I fear is a very imperfect notice of a veritable
festival of aviculture.
II. HYBRIDS AND BRITISH BIRDS.
By J. L. Bonhote.
The British Birds were as usual well represented at this
Show, and the glorious trim and condition of many of our
common birds must have convinced the most sceptic that our
country can, in its avifauna, show as beautiful an assortment as
many others more favoured from the climatic point of view.
We have not time or space to go into detail over the well-
filled classes of Bullfinches, Chaffinches, Linnets, Redpolls and
others, but must confine our notes chiefly to the rarer kinds. We
were sorry to notice that three Classes (Song Thrush, Wagtail,
A.O.V. Thrushes and Woodpeckers) had to be cancelled from
lack of entries. All these species make most satisfactory cage-
birds and, especially the Thrushes, are widely kept, and it is
disappointing to see that where such a good and liberal classifi-
cation is offered fanciers do not support it.
The gem of the collection was undoubtedly Mr. Pauwels
fine pair of Wallcreepers, a species we do not remember to have
previously seen in confinement, and from their condition and
feather they certainly did credit to the owner and Mr. Milsum.

Another rarity was a very nice Grasshopper Warbler in good
condition, though, we understand, that it had found the journey
rather trying ; the same Class contained Dartford Warblers, a Wry-
neck and a splendid adult Black Redstart in beautiful plumage.
Among the Larks and Pipits were several Shore Larks and two
Rock Pipits, the last named being quite a rarity in a cage, although
common enough round our shores. Class 160: European Birds,
contained beside the Wallcreepers, a Two-barred Crossbill, which
we fancy we saw last year, an Icterine Warbler, a Red-breasted
Flycatcher and a Snow Finch, as well as one or two commoner
species. Class 157 contained a Sedge Warbler, a Willow Warbler,
and a Greater and Lesser Whitethroat. On walking through a
Show such as this one cannot help wishing that some of those who
so persistently decry bird-keeping could be present, most of their
arguments would at once fall to the ground, for the excellent
health and condition of these delicate birds, and their reappear-
ance at the same Shows in successive years is sufficient proof
that kindness, care and attention, and not starvation and cruelty
has been bestowed upon them. Unfortunately these people never
come to look for themselves! The Pied and Albino Class con-
tained a fine Silver Starling, which has been, if we remember
right, seen on the show bench for several years past. There was
a white Robin and a white Hedge Sparrow, both showing a
tinge of yellow on the breast, and a Bullfinch with a white cap
suffused with a delicate pinkish tinge. Hybrids were a strong
lot ; the Bullfinch hybrids included Redpoll, Linnet, Greenfinch,
Goldfinch; there were also Greenfinch-Redpoll, Redpoll-Gold-
finch, Siskin-Greenfinch, Bramble-Chaffinch, Twite-Greenfinch,
Goldfinch-Siskin, Siskin-Redpoll and Greenfinch-Chaffinch.
This last is probably the greatest rarity, and is the first and
only one that has so far been bred. In general bulk and shape it
takes after the Greenfinch, the colour of the back is brown and
we could not detect auj^ trace of the bluish head of the Chaffinch.
The breast was pale vinous, clearly showing the Chaffinch origin,
fading off to yellow on the vent, The wings showed the white
bases to the primaries characteristic of the Chaffinch. We see
no reason to doubt the parentage of this bird, the only other
possibility is a Bramble-Chaffinch, but the build is so much that

Mr. H. E. Atteweee,
of a Greenfinch that this species must, in our opinion, have been
one of the parents. The bird was bred by Miss Reeves, to whom
the fancy is already indebted for many rare hybrids. In this
case hen Chaffinches were put in an aviary witli cocks of the
following species : Hawfinch, Greenfinch, Goldfinch and Canary,
so that it is obvious that the bird could have had no other origin
than from a Greenfinch and Chaffinch. We much regret that
among the many good things we omitted to make any notes on
Mr. Vales Twite-Greenfinch, a cross, which though not unique,
is but seldom seen.

By H. E. Attewele.
&amp;apos;I he Savannah Blackbird or Tickbird (C?olophaga (ini&amp;apos;) is
not one of the few species to which Jamaica claims exclusive
rights : it is found in many tropical parts and its main character-
istics are pretty well known. Gosse portrays it very accurately,,
and being so much in evidence there are multitudes who can
confirm his writing on the bird. 41
Some C. ant have recently been engaged in nesting near
my house, and we have to some extent been able to follow the
birds' habits.
May I be allowed to draw, say, two-tlrirds of a circle with
approximately fifty yards for the radius and the house as a centre.
There will be included an ebony tree, a tamarind, a genip,
another tamarind, next a guango and then a yokewood tree. A
few others of smaller size and impoi lance punctuate those named.
At the time I write, the first mentioned, the ebony, contains a
Blue Quits ( Euphonia Jamaica&amp;apos;) nest, the next has still the nest
of a Banana Quit ( Cerlhiola flaveola) hanging from a twig, the
young birds having quit two weeks previously. The genip tree
and its next neighbour have both been favoured by C. atii, while
high on the guango, which grows almost into the last, the
" Roggerhead" ( 1 &amp;apos;yrannus caudifascialus) has very recently reared
a young bird, and the last-named tree of my list--the yoke-
wood -- a week ago had at its top the hammock-like nest of the

Banana Bird (Icterus leucopteryx), whose two young resolutely
refused to be hand-reared. If you will follow me less than one
hundred yards from this imaginary arc-end I will show you one
more nest--also in an ebony tree--it is that of the Ground Dove
{Chamcepelia passerina), a poor platform nest the size of a small
man's palm, in which the fully-fledged young can be seen side by
side, making as charming a picture as one could wish. No doubt
if we looked around a little, more than one Mocking Bird's nest
could easily be found, and just over there in that bank it is safe
to say at least one Tody's eggs or young could be found. We
are satisfied further that a pair of Long-tailed Humming Birds
(Aiihurus polytmus) have nested in the Banana Quit's tamarind
tree, and, judging from the scores of Vervain Humming Birds
(.Mellisnga minima) that resort to its blossoms, there must be
several nests of such birds not far away, the size of which may be
incidentally mentioned as being, when the young has flown , no
bigger on the top than a two-shilling piece! I have proved this,
nor did the coin slip from the top into the nest. While digres-
sing let me just add one other nest that is to be found in the
particular trees named. It is that of the common brown rat
driven to an arboreal life by the mongoose. I more than suspect
this animal has interfered with my Blackbirds in one instance
and 'improved' on the birds architecture to its own purpose.
Nor is the Savannah Blackbird's nest much to brag about.
Let it be remembered the bird is nearly related to the Cuckoos,
and all honour to the Cuckoo that makes a nest. We may
congratulate the creature on its higher sense of duty ; it may,
however, be an open cpiestion as to whether the bird is 011 the
upgrade or the reverse.
Popular belief allows quite a number of these birds to
designedly assist each other in nidification. My own examples
do not completely confirm the argument, for in neither of two
instances was an unusually large structure made nor more than
eight eggs laid. I have examined several old nests, and in every
case have found one or more old eggs buried in the materials,
such being ebony and lignum vitae twig ends with upholstery
of maseberry leaves.

Notes on some Jamaican Birds.
going on, it might be suspected that they were but one remove
better than the familiar Cuckoo proper, whose propensity for
shirking maternal cares is so well known and, but for this interest,
one might infer that, having found another of the family so
minded as to build for herself and to incubate, the opportunity
is seized to add to the proposed complement of eggs. There is,
I think, some evidence of hesitation for, on one occasion, I dis-
covered an undoubted Savannah Blackbird's egg in an undoubted
Mocking Bird's partially-built nest scarcely beyond one's natural
reach.
It is well the bird's egg is so coated with calcareous matter,
for the scratches and raspings tell the rough treatment it receives
from this most clumsy-footed creature. Indeed, so strongly is the
egg put together that I have had several dropped, say thirty feet,
on to a lawn without fracture ! It is the ungainly bird's clumsiness
that makes him so conspicuous an object; he cannot perch with
a balance until a see-saw exercise has been gone through. Were
not the arched culmen of the upper mandible as good as wanting
in the naked coffee-coloured and open-eyed chick, one might
conclude the exaggeration was of use as a lever in helping them
from the hard egg-shell.
At the risk of life, limb (and law) it was possible to keep a
brood of these birds under observation ; they were raised and
lowered pulley wise in a cage, and our hopes they would not be
neglected were realized. Seeds, berries and insects are the Tick-
birds chief diet, which also includes a lizard. There is also no
reason why a fully-grown mouse should not be relished, but it
surely shows a lack of discernment to present such to young
birds; this animal, a lizard and a very large grasshopper were all
found tramped underfoot by the caged brood. The morsels were
far too large. Elsewhere than in Jamaica ' home remedies' are
fearful and wonderful, but I think mouse- tea for whooping-cough
beats all. I was presently asked by one, who proved to have
been a spectator, for the mouse ! Asking its use, I was assured it
was when made into tea a certain cure for the complaint named.
Whilst on the bird's bill of fare, it seems to me more than
likely very many small snakes, reputedly scarce in Jamaica, find
their way to C. ani&amp;apos;s digestive organs. It is wonderful how

digression I close. Quite recently, screams from a kitchen filled
the household with alarm--the terror-stricken cook could only
point to a partly-dressed fowl. Quiet having been obtained

By The Curator.
The most important additions during the past month con-
sist of three very rare Lories deposited by Dr. Philip H. Bahr,
namely, a Green-tailed Lory (Lorius chlorocercus&amp;apos;) from the Solo-
mon Islands, and a pair of extremely beautiful Ruffed Lorikeets
( Calliptihis solitarius) from Fiji. The first of these is not new
to the Society, a pair having been purchased as long ago as 1867,
from which Wolf made a coloured drawing which was published
in the Proceedings for that year. The prevailing colour of the
bird is red, the wings and apical half of the tail green. The top
of the head and a patch on each side of the neck black, while
the breast is crossed by a band of yellow.
More beautiful still, and quite new to the Society's collec-
tion, is the Ruffed Lory or Lorikeet, which Latham called the
Solitary Lory--a name which is most inappropriate, as the species
is gregarious and anything but solitary. In Fiji it is known as
the "Kula," and is said to be trapped in numbers by the natives
for the sake of its bright feathers which are used for the personal
adornment of the Tongans and Samoans. The F&amp;apos;ijians keep
them in captivity, and the native girls are said to feed them on
sugar-cane which they (the girls) chew, and allow the birds to
take from their lips.
The Ruffed Lory is about the size of the Ornate Lorikeet,
but has a short rounded tail. It is green on the upper parts,
bright red below with a very dark blue cap and a band of the
same colour on the abdomen and thighs. Its chief beauty, how-

ever, lies in the collar or ruff of long pointed green and crimson
feathers on the nape which give it a quite unique appearance.
Besides the foregoing, Dr. Balir has very kindly presented
the Society with four of the beautiful Parrot Finch from Fiji,
Erythrnra pealei, which, I understand, is shortly to be figured in
this journal.
A pair of the curious Coscoroba Swans (Coscoroba Candida)
from southern South America have been received by exchange,
and make an interesting addition to our collection of waterfowl,
as the species has not been represented in the Gardens of late
years.
I have often thought that it would be interesting to en-
courage the nesting of wild Tits in the Zoological Gardens by
providing them with suitable nesting sites, and we have now been
enabled to do this by the generosity of Mr. J. M. D. Mackenzie,
who has obtained from Germany more than a dozen of the ex-
cellent nesting-logs designed by Herr von Berlepsch, and placed
them at our disposal for use in the Gardens. Fortunately there
are plenty of suitable trees, and the logs have been fixed in
various parts of the Gardens, and we hope they will be occupied
in the Spring.

Mv aviaries are built in rather a rustic maimer facing south-west,
backing out on an estuary of the Solent, (the Beaulieu River).
The laud, slopes down to the water so that the avaries get very wet
in the winter.
The largest aviary is twenty-seven feet square, with two sheds at the
back, and the birds can always go in or out of these at their pleasure.
The sheds are rather draughty, and in prolonged wet weather the
rain comes through the roof. The birds do not seem to mind though and
always look in the pink of condition. I do not think I have had a single
*case of a bird dying from cold pure and simple.
Before I had the aviary properly boarded up at the ends, I lost some
birds after several days of continual south-west gale with driving rain.
My onl}&amp;apos; fad is to under feed my birds. That is to say, they are fed
every morning and by the next day every seed is eaten and they have
evidently got healthy appetites for their breakfast.
Their menu consists of Canary seed (the best) French millet and
\0x25A0spray millet and a few Sunflower seeds. In cold weather they have in
addition, a little hemp.
I cannot help thinking that many birds in captivity are over-fed.
.Since feeding mine less they have looked much better and are much more
active.
All the birds can pick over the soft-food which consists of " Cecto,"
bread and cake crumbs, currants, sultanas, suet (in cold weather), any fruit
that is in season and green stuff. Mealworms in winter only, as the birds
\0x25A0catch so many insects amongst the bushes and tall grass.

As year by year the number of new species to be discovered
becomes less and less, so, by slow degrees, ornithologists are
beginning to find out that the mere describing and naming of
some hitherto unknown species adds but little to our real
knowledge of birds.
If any further proof were needed to drive home what is
really a self-evident proposition this work of Dr. Bureau, the
eminent French ornithologist, should be of itself sufficient to
dispel any doubts on the matter. Dr. Bureau has taken one of
our commonest species, and one, moreover, which is perhaps the
most frequently shot of any of our native birds, not to mention
hand-rearing, importation and other factors which bring this
bird to the notice of sportsmen, game-keepers, ornithologists,
caterers, cooks and others, and yet how many of these people,
to whom such matters are, or should be, of considerable import-
ance, can tell an old from a young bird in December?
This work is devoted entirely to questions of plumage and
moult. Dr. Bureau has made exhaustive notes by watching and
marking coveys in their wild state and has further called in
aviculture by checking his results and getting more precise data
from captive birds. The result is a very careful and complete
account of their plumages and methods of moult, especially
during the first six months of their lives.
Of the main facts brought forward there can be no doubt.
The author shows that a partridge in its first year may always
be told by the first two primaries being pointed and not rounded
as in the case of the old birds. This is due to the fact that these
first two primaries are not moulted in autumn with the others
and thus form remnants of the juvenile plumage. Until October
or November, Dr. Bureau holds that the age of any young bird
can be told almost to a day by the length and development of
the growing primaries. We are inclined to think that sufficient
allowance has not been made for individual variation in this

respect, but, according to the facts given, the case is clearly made
out, and must, therefore, be accepted, at all events for that part
of the country (West of France) where the observations were
made.
&amp;apos;File young birds make their first flight when thirteen days
old, by which time seven primaries and eight secondaries are
fairly well developed, the third primary is still in the quill, and
the first two have not yet made their appearance; at the age of
twenty-three days the tenth primary is cast, and the second
primary, which has not yet grown, makes its appearance ; five
days later the ninth primary is cast and the first appears, and
thus the moult continues till all, except the first two, have been
renewed. Apart from the primaries, which, from the point of
view of age, are the most important character, other details of
the moult and plumages are well and carefully dealt with, and we
notice that while accepting the differences in the wing coverts, as
first described by Mr. Grant in the Field , as the best means for
distinguishing the sexes, the author is careful to point out that
this distinction by no means holds good for nil cases. The book
is one to which justice cannot be done in a short critique, it bears
the mark of most accurate and painstaking work, adds greatly to
our knowledge of the species, and is well worthy of a place on
the bookshelves of every lover of the 'little brown bird.'
THE COMMON GUEE. *
This is a book of photographs showing various phases in
the life history of the Common Gull, and although it can hardly
be said that the pictures are very descriptive, or tell us anything
new about the life history of these interesting birds, the book
forms a nice addition to the pictures of bird-life of which we see
so many now-a-days. Some of the photographs are not as
'sharp' as we should like and appear to have been touched up ;
and others, as for instance ' Following the Plough ' is a most
artistic picture, but the birds are rather small. A short account
of the species, translated from the Danish, is given at the end of
the book.

MIGRATION OF BIRDS.*

The Sixth Annual Report of the B. O. C. Migration Com-
mittee is brought out ou similar lines to the previous Reports.
We are, however, pleased to notice one very beneficial change,
namely, the summarising of the autumn records, where possible,
into a connected account, instead of the interminable list of
records given in the previous Report. Besides economy of space,
this new method will prove much more interesting and intelli-
gible to the general reader. These Reports only deal with the
actual records received during the year, and no attempt is made
to generalize or draw any deductions for the present, though, as
we are told in the introduction, this will be done to some extent
when material over a sufficient number of years has been got
together. The main facts of interest during the spring of 1910
appear to have been the absence of any great ' rushes,' and the
extremely late arrival of certain species, e.g. the Spotted Fly-
catcher.
The scarcity of the Land Rail in the southern and eastern
counties is well shown by the occurrence of only one record
(Norfolk, May 6th) east of a line extending from Wilts to York-
shire. Within the last ten years it was a common bird in
Cambridgeshire, as well as in many other of the south-eastern
counties, and its almost complete disappearance in so short a
time is very remarkable. The autumn notes contain records on
a large number of species; of the common birds, a fairly full and
connected account of their movements is given, while in other
cases we have the records of solitary rare wanderers, such as
the Barred Warbler, Golden Oriole, Red-breasted Flycatcher,
Lesser Kestrel, Honey Buzzard, and many others.
We recommend this Report to all students of our native
birds, it will bring home to them the movements and travels of
the bird world, which are going on in practically every month of
the year, and which may be noted by anyone who cares to observe
and note the different species met with in any particular area,

THE EMU&amp;apos;*
The numbers of this Journal under review contain, as
usual, many interesting articles on the Australian and New
Zealand fauna. In the April number Mr. Jackson gives an in-
teresting account of his search for the nest of the Rufous Scrub
Bird (. Atrichornis rufescens), a very rare and skulking species.
The article is illustrated by numerous photographs showing the
nature of the bush and situation of the nest. Mr. Jackson also
met with the Tyre Bird and gives photographs of its nest and
dancing ground.
The July number contains, among many other notes, a
long and interesting paper by Mr. S. C. McLean on the Bush
birds of New Zealand, and by Mr. Barnard on Field notes from
Cape Yoik.
In the October number we have a nice coloured plate of
the Yellow Shrike Tit (.Falcunculus whitei). Mr. McLean con-
tinues his notes on New Zealand Birds; Mr. Cleland writes a
valuable paper ou the stomach contents of many species of
native birds, and Mr. Buturlin, the well-known Russian Orni-
thologist, gives an account of the Australian Birds lie met with
in Siberia, and there are also many articles and notes on other
Australian Birds. Our friends in Australia are evidently keen
ornithologists, and they are fortunate in possessing a most in-
teiesting avifauna, about which we have still much to learn.

PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
X. QUAILS.
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The Quails and their allies form a group of little birds
that are very attractive inmates of the aviary. They are mostly
hardy, and many of them will breed quite readily in captivity
providing the aviary in which they are kept possesses certain
necessary features. It should be of fairly large size, or rather
should cover a good sized area, though it need not be very lofty.
If possible it should not be less than from thirty to forty feet
square, but if twice or three times this size, so much the better.
The greater part should be turfed and planted with clumps of
bushes, and the grass allowed to grow to its full height during
the summer. The birds should have access to a well-lighted
dry shed where they can indulge in a dust bath whenever they
feel so inclined.
The species of Quails and Quail-like birds are very
numerous, and it is impossible here to mention them all or to
go into details as to the special treatment necessary for some of
the rarer kinds. Those which are most likely to be kept in cap-
tivity are the Common Quail (Coturnix coturnix) and its allies
the Rain Quail, the Harlequin Quail, and the Australian Quail ;
the Chinese Quail (Excalpactoria chinensis ); the Australian
Swamp Quail ( Sjnoecus australis&amp;apos;) ; the Jungle Bush Quail {Per-

dicula asiatica), and some of the American Ouails, amongst
which is the commonest and most beautiful of all as an aviary
bird, the Californian Ouail.
All of the foregoing are hardy, and easily kept on a simple
diet of seed and green food, and most of them are not particularly
quarrelsome. I should not be disposed, however, to keep either
Bush Quails or Californian Quails with other species of the
smaller ground birds, though I have not found any of the others
to be particularly aggressive if kept in a large enough enclosure.
The only difficulty in keeping more than one species of the same
genus, say of Coturnix in the same aviary is that cross-breeding
may occur, if say a pair of the Indian Rain Quails and a pair
of African Harlequins are kept together.
Quails commence pairing about April, but do not, as a
rule, go to nest until the grass is well grown. Then the cock is
very busy, uttering his shrill call-note and selecting sites for the
nest which he tries to persuade his mate to adopt. The site
finally selected is generally under a tuft of coarse grass which
is cleverly concealed by the blades being drawn down to form a
dome. The number of eggs to a clutch varies with the species,
but six or seven is the usual number for the smaller species,
while the Californian Quail often lays considerably more. In-
cubation is performed by the female only, and occupies from
sixteen to twenty days according to the species. Young Quails
when first hatched are extremely beautiful little things, resem-
bling miniature partridge chicks. They remain in the nest with
the mother for about the first twenty-four hours, after which
they follow her away into the grass.
This is a critical time for the chicks, for should there be
any weakly ones they may be left behind, when they soon perish.
A plan adopted by the writer some years ago for rearing
young Quails proved very successful. A run, about six feet long
by four feet wide and twelve inches high was made, the sides
close boarded, but the top of wire netting, one end was hinged at
the top so as to allow of the Quail and her brood being driven in.
Part of the top was made to open for feeding. Teafy branches
were placed over part of this run, and a sheet of corrugated iron

kept in readiness to be placed over in case of heavy rain. Care
was taken that the run was placed on good turf in a dry situation.
Into such a run the hen Quail with her brood is driven
as soon after they leave the nest as possible. Ants' nests are
searched for and dug up (enough can usually be found in any
fair-size garden) and a tin of ants and their eggs kept in readiness
to supply the chicks at frequent intervals. After a day or two
finely chopped yolk of egg is supplied and readily taken by the
chicks, which after a short time will take coarser soft food con-
sisting of chopped egg, breadcrumbs and finely chopped chick-
weed. Seed, in the form of millet and Canary, must be supplied
for the mother, and it is surprising how soon the chicks also will
take to eating this.
A dusting bath-- consisting of aheap of dry lime rubbish
and sharp sand--must not be omitted from the run. About once
a week it is desirable to move this run on to fresh ground, and
when the young birds are about three weeks old they can be let
out with their mother into the aviary again. It is desirable,
however, to clip the feathers of one wing to prevent their flying
up and damaging their heads against the top of the aviary. In
fact most Quails in captivity are best pinioned so that it is
impossible for them to fly against the aviary roof. The American
Quails however are great perchers and should be left with full
wings.
I know of few prettier sights than that presented by a
brood of newly-hatched Chinese Quails, little larger than bumble-
bees, as they follow their mother through the grass, or rush to
her call when she captures some tiny insect.

A ROCCOLO IN ITALY.
By Hubert D. Astley, M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
The bird's death-trap ! The autumnal migration through
the valleys, up the gullies, a constant flitting and flutter of wings.
They are going south, these thousands and thousands, and what
thousands never reach their destination, for the rocolli are there
awaiting them, perched on every available wooded projection and
promontary. Very picturesque to look at. A flat piece of ground
on an eminence is chosen, sometimes not far above a lake, some-
times higher up the mountains, A small building is erected,
looking in the distance like the remains of some ruined tower, in
front of which is a large circle of young trees, trained into the
form of a bower. The building, of stone, with usually a roof of
the same material, consists of a ground floor and an upper one.
The room on the ground floor faces towards the actual roccolo,
and in it is kept a heterogeneous collection of decoy birds, as well
as a few of the fresh caught ones for which there may be a sale
as living specimens. It is quite small, and quite dirty, this lower
place.
In the one I visited, there were as far as freshly caught
birds went, some dozen Goldfinches, a fine Fieldfare, a Redwing
(it was the 20th of October), one or two Song Thrushes, two or
three Coal Tits, a Serin Finch and some Hawfinches. One was
sorry for these prisoners, but all pity for them was swamped at
finding two blinded birds, blinded by a hot wire I fancy, and
blinded for life.
The abomination and the vileness of it! The ignorant
brutality ! These poor birds are supposed to call all the more

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
when they hear their wild brothers and sisters and cannot see
them. Call? no wonder they call. But why haven't their cries
been heard through all these many years by the Church of the
country. Is it because to preach against such horrors would be
unpopular, is it because it matters not what the people do so long
as coffers are full. Bah ! and if you complain to the Priests they
shrug their shoulders. The dumb animals are not Christians,
and they who should and could have (it is getting rather too late
now) taught their people the spirit of mercy, are amongst the
first to fill their bellies with Robins, Titmice and even Golden-
crested Wrens, some of which have been lured to their death by
blinded birds.
I think that the man in the roccolo ' sat up' that day when
I told him what I thought about it all, and a wooden cross was
erected on the top of the turret where he crouched like a large
spider awaiting flies. I asked him whether it signified the
crucifixion of the birds? I asked him whether he supposed the
' Santissima Vergine ' smiled upon him when he went to Mass,
leaving his birds with their scorched and lifeless eyes in the
Roccolo.
The Roccolo! My indignation has drawn me from the
description of the turret. At the back is a flight of stone steps
leading first of all into a small lobby where food is kept for the
fowlers, and from thence you ascend a short ladder which brings
you into the upper chamber overlooking and surmounting the
death-bower. There is no window, but a large opening, with
boards fixed at either side in which are gaps for peeping through,
and a space in the centre. Behind the boards, which are as it
were rough shutters, the fowler sits holding what at first sight
might be taken for a rosary, but is really small brass bird-calls
of various notes and sounds strung on a string, one of these
calls he keeps to his lips and from time to time imitates
first one bird and then another. Suddenly he rises up. Two
or three birds, attracted by the decoys or by the artificial calls,
have settled on the bent saplings. At the fowler's feet is a heap
of wicker racquets, or what look like short-handled racquets:
one of these he siezes and quickly hurls it through the open
space between the shutters, through the window one might say,

accompanying the action with a shrill high-sounding blowing
whistle through his teeth in imitation of the descent of a large
winged bird. The Linnets or Goldfinches, or whatever they may
happen to be, hearing the sound and seeing the wicker racquet
hurtling towards them, mistake it for a hawk, and immediately
dive down amongst the trees only to be immeshed in the spiders'
web of fine nets, which not only encircle the whole bower, but
also stretch across within the Roccolo in more than one place.
The nets are of fine thread, and are full of pockets from top to
toe. Diiectly a bird flutters against one, it falls into a pocket
and has no more chance of escape.
All round the tops of the entwined saplings which form
the circle, small cages are fastened in which are the decoys.
Chaffinches, Hawfinches, Linnets, Titmice, Thrushes, Bramble
Finches, etc. The older and staider ones call repeatedly, and the
Chaffinches break into song. It is the only song to be heard in
Italy at the time of the autumn migration. What an irony !
For the rest, the fowlers and the cacciatori (hunters)--" sports-
men " I suppose they call themselves--are everywhere with their
abominable nets and their guns.
The poor biids are not given much chance of singing !
One would laugh if one was not so disgusted, to see a well to do
Italian " cacciatore " issue forth fora day's shooting, often garbed
in impossible knicker bockers and stockings with yellow button
boots very long and turned up at the points. A gun and a
cartridge-bag and a "cane di caccia "--generally a mongrel
pointer. And there he goes stalking a Tom-tit, and banging
here, there and everywhere, not infrequently just by the high
road itself, and also not infrequently sending a shower of small
shot rattling about your head as you sit in your garden. I have
seen some of these gentry shooting at House Martins. If their
grandmothers were good to eat they'd shoot them.
But I have strayed again from that hateful Roccolo, (bye-
the-bye ! the first "o" is long, the last two short in pronouncing
the word, and in Italian the "o" is as round as that of Giotto's).
Besides the decoys in cages, some Chaffinches or Green-
finches are tied round their bodies by string, which latter ascends
from the ground within the circle to the hand of the fowler up in

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
the turret, and from time to time he gives it a pull, so that the
imprisoned decoys at the other end are jerked into the air and
fluttered up and down, and attract any passers-by. Oh! there
is no end to the fowler's abominable wiles. And a pathetic part
of it is that these fowlers are oftentimes the most simple-minded
men of the peasant order, who seem entirely unaware of the
acts of cruelty they are committing, and are as astonished to be
told it is so, as an Englishman would be when ratting.
At any rate, even although we may in many respects live
in a glass-house, one can hardly conceive it possible for a large
majority of English bird-catchers to deliberately burn bird's eye-
sight away, although I should add that even in Italy such an
abomination is illegal ; but it is one thing to make a law and
quite another to obey it, or wink at the disobeying of it.
Italy, however, is not wanting in men and women who
are striving to change the order of things. Perhaps the prime
mover is Professor Giacinto Martorelli, an honorary member
of our Society, and head of the Turati Collection in the Natural
History Museum at Milan. Writing to me on thecist of October
in answer to a letter of mine in which I deplored the destruction
of migrants in Italy, Professor Martorelli says :--" lam absolutely
"and totally in agreement with you and with all enlightened
" foreigners in deploring and condemning the extermination of
" the birds which is going on in Italy, and I am endeavouring to
"bring forward certain 'propaganda' along with many others
" who deplore this destruction, for putting an end to such bar-
" barous acts."
This is good hearing. We indeed wish Professor Martorelli
all success. The task he has set himself is not an easy one, for
he has to fight with prejudice, selfishness, and an hereditary
habit handed down through many generations.
At the Roccolo which I visited, I counted at least one
hundred and fifty birds which lay dead in a promiscuous heap
on the floor of the watch-tower, all of which had been killed in
two days. Think of it ! and there were certainly seven separate
roccoli within sight. Is it then any exaggeration to say that Italy
destroys in October and November alone of every year, thousands

and thousands of song birds and birds that are eminently useful
for the benefit of the agriculturist.
The proprietor of the Roccolo which I visited told me that
he had during that week taken 500 birds, and that such a number
was a fair average at each Roccolo. On asking how many there
were in the immediate neighbourhood, he said "twelve," within
easy walking distance. This means the destruction of at least
5,000 birds weekly in that one small area. What must it then be
throughout the whole country ? Another fowler told me that
last autumn (1910) he took 10,000 birds, and his Roccolo is quite
small and comparatively insignificant.
The heap of birds' bodies that I saw consisted of Starlings,
Tree (or Mountain) Sparrows, Linnets, Greenfinches, Chaffinches,
Goldfinches, Hawfinches, Serin Finches, Redstarts, Blackcaps,
Robins, Song Thrushes, Blackbirds, one Nutcracker, Blue and
Coal Tits, and others, such as a Fieldfare and a Redwing.
The great migration of Robins had not yet commenced,
but in another week or two it would be a usual thing to see men
walking in the streets of the country towns carrying a bunch of
dead Robins as large as a football. Only the other day, a man
came to my door to ask whether I wanted to buy any birds for the
table, holding up a cascade of dead Goldfinches \_what a rosary !]
of which there must have been at least three hundred. How
there are any birds left puzzles one! That man didn't linger
at my door, you may be sure.
That Roccolo haunts me. As I stood on that wooded
eminence in the stillness of the autumn day, the glassy lake of
Como sweeping away into the far distance below me, the grandeur
of the surrounding mountains towering above me, their wooded
slopes now tinged with every shade of autumnal tints reflected
in the blue-green waters, I thought indeed how vile mankind
can be. So still was the air, that one heard the approach of the
migrants, flitting, flitting to their death. Up rose the fowler
again, the wicker racquets hurtling over the bower, the quick
dive downwards of the birds, the fluttering of entangled wings
. . . . . Andiamo! Let us go ! !

By Katharine Currey.
There is a peculiar charm about the Blue Bird of America,
not only in its wild state, but as a companion and pet--the little
bird with the bright brown eye and the colours of the earth and
sky, so exquisitely described by John Burroughs, the Nature
poet par excellence, in his little book called " Wake Robin," and
others of his works. In " Birds and Poets," he says : " It is sure
to be a bright March morning when you first hear his note," and
that note he describes in a charming sentence: &amp;quot;A note that
may be called the violet of sound, and as welcome to the ear,
heard above the cold, damp earth, as is its floral type to the eye
a few weeks later." Lowell writes of
"The Blue bird shifting his light load of song
From post to post, along the cheerless fence."
Burroughs further says : "The Blue Bird cannot utter an
unpleasing note. Indeed, he seems to have but one language,
one speech for both love and war, and the expression of his
indignation is nearly as musical as his song." And he describes
the song by the words " pure, pure, pure."
The colours of the earth and sky of the Blue Robin are
described and descanted on by John Burroughs in "Wake Robin"
at too great a length to quote in this little sketch. The bird
arrives in March, while the snow is still lying about, and truly he
embodies in his plumage the whole of his environment, the blue
sky, the brown earth and trees, the white snow. To my mind
the hen is almost more lovely than her mate. Her forget-me-not
blue wing-feathers, and brown and grey shading into pearly-
white, of the rest of her little person blend so softly and har-
moniously. What wonder the Blue Bird is such a favourite
theme of poets. Emerson refers to

As if the wand'rer were alone,
And hardly knew to sing or cry.
But now a flash of eager wing,
Flitting, twinkling by the wall,
And pleadings sweet and am'rous call, --
Ah! now I know his heart doth sing!
O blue bird, welcome back again,
Thy azure coat and ruddy vest
Are hues that April lovetli best, --
Warm skies above the furrowed plain.

And thy blue wing's a joyous sight

He also mentions the fact that the early settlers of New
England gave it the name of Blue Robin, and that " it is the first
bit of colour that cheers our Northern landscape."
' Wistful,' I think, exactly expresses the Blue Bird's note,
but though, according to Rongfellow :
" Aloud,
From cottage roof the warbling blue bird sings."
and he speaks of
" The Blue Bird, balanced on some topmost spray,
Flooding with melody the neighbourhood."
I have never heard them utter more than three notes --
always the same--which I can only describe by the words:
" Tee-ee-wee! " Sometimes they warbled, softly and sweetly,
but they never sang a full song when with me, perhaps they
were in a strange land.
Now that the exportation of the Blue Bird from his native
land is prohibited -- and as a Wild Birds' Protectionist I rejoice
at the law, for a Blue Robin in a dealer's shop was a sight that
tugged at the heart-strings!--his companionship remains only a
sweet memory. In years gone by I kept many pairs of them,
and they were very intelligent and interesting.
I had several pairs in an aviary on the lawn, where they
lived together in harmony, but never nested. This I did not
regret, as an aviary-bred bird at best is not equal to a wild one.

On the Blue Robin.
The aviary was roofed-in at one end, with shelves far under, and
on the shelves I placed little open wooden boxes for them to
roost iu, for they never slept on a perch. They looked too sweet
peeping out of their boxes, and uttering low little* tee-ee-wees '
before going to sleep. One day the aviary door was left open
by accident, and they all got out and flew about in the trees.
Wonderful to relate, they all came back again, one or two let
themselves be caught quite easily. I fed them on all the insects,
beetles, worms and grubs, and on potato, bread and carrot, with
a little egg food, berries and ants' eggs. Every other day they
had scraped meat.
Some of my Blue Birds suffered from a disease in the feet
that caused them to swell terribly. I was told it was a parasite,
but though I tried all the remedies I knew of, and asked an
expert's advice the disease was never cured. Once I rescued a
poor old ragged hen at a dealer's. She had been evidently quite
wrongly fed, and had suffered much and needed care and nursing.
After tending her for a little time, I turned her in with the
others, and there chanced to be an odd cock among them. The
other pairs looked askance at her, and would not let her feed,
but the cock took her part, and prevented her from being bullied.
It was surely pure chivalry on his part, for she was old and
ragged. She died in a moult, and the cock mourned and missed
her.
I kept once a single pair, in a half-free state through the
winter. The)&amp;apos; had a large aviary-cage to live in, roofed-in at one
end iu a South window, with nesting-boxes and holes to enter
them by. Iu them they slept. By day the cage-door was left
open, and they could fly about the house, perching on a large
branch that rested on the roof of the cage and reached up to the
top of the window. They ate out of my hand, and came to my
call, and warbled their cheery little notes all day long. The wild
Robins, who fly about in and out of the house as soon as summer
is over, were very jealous of them, but they did not fight. The
Blue Birds seemed to regard them as a big dog does a little one,
and perhaps they recognised that they were in their own country,
whereas they themselves were foreigners.

Dacelo gigantea.
By R. Cosgrave.
I feel sure that the readers of the Avicultural Magazine
will be interested to hear of the successful breeding of the above
species. I believe it to be the first occasion that these birds have
reared young in this country.
About the 20th of last April the pair showed unmistakable
signs of nesting, taking possession of a box. which had been
put for some Alpine Choughs. They removed all the nesting
material that it contained ; when I gave more of different kinds
it was at once removed, still tliey did not place anything in the
box of their own choice or settle to nest in earnest. It occurred
to me that the box was not large enough and that I was not
giving proper nesting material, so I procured another box, i8in.
by I2in., with a large hole in front to allow the bird to go in and
out with ease. For nesting material I got some decomposed wood
and broke it up fine, and this was placed in the box to a depth of
about three inches. The box I next nailed securely against
the wall of their indoor compartment, about nine feet from the
ground. They at once took to this, and on May 10th, one pearly
white egg, about the size of a Bantam's, was laid, two more were
added on alternate days, and the birds commenced to sit at once.
Incubation lasted twenty-one days, both birds taking equal share
of the work. On the 19th day, finding both the birds off the
nest longer than usual at feeding time, I determined to look and
see if all was going well, but met with disappointment, two of
the eggs had vanished, not the slightest trace of them could I
find. My hopes were destroyed for the time being, for I felt sure
that the remaining egg would share the same fate. However, it
was not so, the birds went on sitting, and on the erst day we
could hear the young calling in the nest. When the birds were
off to feed I took a very hurried glance, but enough to see that
the young was perfectly naked. After ten days I had another
look and found that it had grown well, it was standing or sitting
upright and looked like a young Owl or a ball of white wool. &lt;
In case of doing harm I did not look at it again until it was three

weeks old, this time it had developed well and had feathers all
over the body. The wing feathers were well advanced, and when
looked at on the last two occasions it made a very loud terrified
noise, which caused the parents to investigate and me to beat a
hasty retreat. Consequently it was not possible for me to take
proper notes and I must apologise to our readers accordingly.
When four weeks old the youngster left the nest, and im-
mediately joined its parents in the outer flight, flying with ease
on to the perches, which are seven feet high, and occasionally
resting on the ground under a large Box bush to shelter from the
extreme heat. We never saw it go back to the nest ; it would,
however, occasionally fly indoors but only for a few minutes at
the time.
It appeared to me astonishing the amount of food that was
required during the day to keep the little one quiet. I gave as
large a variety as possible, which consisted of all caterpillars
that I could get, mealworms, very small pieces of fresh fish, mice,
rabbits, sparrows, sheep's heart, well-cleaned gentles and small
frogs. At the age of four weeks it could eat small mice whole,
and when a large mouse was given, it was amusing to see how it
would be knocked against the perch, after the manner of the
parents going through the process of killing. I have never once
seen the female feed the baby. She sat on the perch calmly
looking on, and sometimes she would have a good hearty laugh
by way of approval of the way her mate carried out his domestic
affairs.
Although the baby could fly well when it emerged from
the nest, its tail-feathers had only grown about one inch. This I
consider worth mentioning, as doubtless the reason is that they
would get broken or badly soiled in the nest. The bill is all dark
brown ; eyes, black ; feet, flesh colour ; breast and all underparts
creamy-white, thickly covered with very fine light brown, hori-
zontal bars; mantle and wings like the parents with one exception,
instead of blue on the wing-bars it is light grey.
I need hardly say that the old birds are very proud of the
young, and do not hesitate to have a go at any bird that ventures
too close to it, even making most determined stoops at a six-foot
man who usually attends to their daily wants.

A JAY NEW TO AVICULTURE.
Ca locitta lidth ii.
By Hubert D. Asteey, M.A.
On the 15th or 16th of November, Mr. A. E. Jamrach
received about ten Jays from the L00-CI100 Islands, of which I
purchased a pair. They are Garrulus (or Calocilta ) lidthii , and
look as if they are closely related to the Hunting Crows, or
Cissas.
They are strikingly handsome. About the bill and throat,
the feathers are black, merging almost immediately into a beau-
tiful deep bluish-purple, which colour covers the head and neck,
as well as the wings and tail ; the back and lower part of the
body being a rich vinous-chestnut, suffused with purple in certain
lights. The outer tail-feathers have white tips, as well as some
of the secondary wing-feathers. The shoulders (scapulars) show
jay-like bars of two shades of the purple-blue. The feathers on
the throat are lanceolate, having white shafts. The bill is pale
horn grey-green, merging to horn white at the tip ; legs and feet
bluish grey ; eyes deep brown.
Like the Cissas, they are very active birds. For many
years it seems that the exact habitat of this beautiful Jay was
unknown ; it was said to come from Japan, or from some island
near that country.
The L00-CI100, or Purple-headed Jay, might serve as a
name to distinguish it. It was called after Professor von Lidtli
de Jeude of Utrecht.
I also bought a very tame specimen of Garrulus bispecularis
(or sinensis), which is found in China and parts of Asia. It is
very like our English Jay, but the whole head and body is pure
cinnamon, and the blue and white barring on the wings is more
extended.
This Jay is I think rather smaller than its English cousin,
and of a finer build.

RED GROUSE IN CONFINEMENT.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997469" page_id="32659172"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
By H. Wormald.
In the early Spring I obtained four pairs of Red Grouse
from the experimental Grouse farm at Frimley, and of all game
birds that I have kept, Grouse have proved themselves by far the
tamest and most interesting, and have the great merit of being
tolerably easy to cater for. I understood that at Frimley the
birds had been provided with heather daily, so at first I had to
get them a bunch every day, besides wheat and dari, but I have
gradually reduced the heather and now they only have it once a
week, and I hope in time that they will do without it altogether.
The birds were very tame when they arrived, and the next day
were quite at home, the cocks crowing vigorously all day, with
their supraorbital combs fully extended and quite ready to attack
anybody who went near them.
In the Spring, when displaying to the liens, cock Grouse
drop their wings and spread their tails and run round the lady of
their choice with their necks stretched out. When crowing, they
stand fairly upright with neck stretched out, gradually raising
themselves until at the end of the crow they are standing on tip
toe and nearly falling over backwards. At the end of a fortnight
the hens showed signs of wishing to go to nest, so I fixed a thick
mass of heather in one corner of each pen, and in a day or two
all four hens commenced laying under the bushes of heather,
which were thick enough to keep out all rain, hail and frost.
They laid on alternate days, and when they had about six eggs
each I removed four from each nest and placed them under
bantams, subsequent events proving that it was very fortunate
that I had done so. The Grouse continued to lay until they had
each deposited some ten eggs, when they commenced to sit; the}&amp;apos;
proved themselves very close sitters and all went well for a fort-
night, when one night a stoat or a rat (I never discovered which)
got into the aviaries and killed two cocks and all the sitting liens,
besides breaking the eggs. On discovering the havoc next
morning, I could do very little except walk round the aviaries,
speaking "winged words" about vermin in general, and taking
steps to ensure the safety of the two remaining cocks. Fortu-

nately I had the eggs under the bantam to fall back upon and,
after twenty-one days incubation, these all hatched out except
three. It is interesting to note that these eggs took twenty-one
days to hatch, as it is generally considered that the period of
incubation is twenty-four days; in fact, eggs which were sent to
me from Scotland some years ago took twenty-four days to hatch.
The newly-hatched chicks are most charming little birds,
very thick set with beautiful yellow down, with rich brown mark-
ings, and "furred" legs and toes. I fed. the chicks on fresh
heather shoots, Spratts' Maxco, hard-boiled egg and maggots.
They grew extraordinarily quickly, and out of one of the broods
of six I never lost a single bird ; they began feathering when
about three days old, and on the ninth day, primaries, secondaries
and both wing-coverts were well developed ; tails coming in and
scapulars growing fast. They flew well when little bigger than
sparrows. I did not lose any birds after they were a week old,
and by August 12th, they were every bit as big and strong as
wild birds, and in just the same state of plumage.
One great point to remember in rearing young grouse,
black game and capercailies is that full sun is fatal even to half-
grown birds; to guard against this Iliad some low, movable
covered pens made, about 30m. high, 12ft. long by 6ft. wide,
boarded half up the sides, and with wire netting lops. I then
spread a thick layer of grass, green boughs, etc. all over the tops
of the pens, so that practically all the interior of the pens was in
the shade, and when it did happen to rain (a rare occurrence this
tropical summer) the young birds kept nice and dry. Grouse,
young or old, must never be without grit, that is a golden rule,
(quartz grit will be found to be the best), grit has been found in
a grouse chick only thirty hours old ! When half-grown the
chicks began to take to dandelion leaves, spinach, chicory, etc.,
and were always very fond of any insects. Quite little chicks
would wrestle with fat yellow under-wing moths, and earwigs
were very popular.
One interesting point which I noticed, and recorded in a
recent number of the Field , is that young Grouse grow tin ee tails
in succession before they are five months old. i e. their first baby
tail which shows when the chicks are nine days old, this is

Mr. H. Wormal,d,
retained until the birds are a fair size, and is then replaced by a
black tail which they wear until after they are quite full-grown,
and is dropped about the middle of September, the outer feathers
on each side being the first to fall out ; in about a month's time
this tail is fully developed, and is black and the feathers stronger
in the quill than the feathers of the second tail were. This tail
is worn until the moult in the following year. At the end of
October both old and young cocks go through a sort of half-
hearted spring display, but their supra-orbital combs are not so
fully extended or of such a brilliant orange scarlet as in the
spring.
Blackcocks meet at their playing-grounds and strut about
purring at this time of year for a week or two, and cock pheasants
frequently give their spring crow and whir their wings, but
apparently it is not considered by the birds nearly such a serious
business as in the spring, and I am not at all sure that the grey
hens put in an appearance at all at the playing grounds in
October.
I have not had my adult Grouse long enough yet to make
a definite statement over the vexed and much discussed question
of their moults, though I expect to find that they go through
three distinct plumage changes in the year.
Grouse are very liable to become afflicted with gape worms;
to guard against this I fumigated my chicks every week after
they were ten days old, and fortunately none of them ever showed
any signs of having gapes. It is not my intention to enter upon
a dissertation upon the disease here, but I strongly recommend
everybody who is interested in rearing game of any sort to shoot
every Sparrow and Starling which they may see showing any
signs of having gapes. I am certain that these pests are carried
and spread from one rearing field to another by these birds.
Comparatively little is definitely known as to how the worm first
gets into the bird ; although there are many so-called "cures" I
do not believe that a really satisfactory cure can be obtained
until more is known of the life history of the worm, and I am
glad to say that at least one well-known scientist is working now
at the subject. Most of the game food providers sell tins of gape
powder for fumigating purposes; plain tobacco smoke is very

effective, but it is very easy to give too much and kill the bird
outright.
Altogether, out of eighteen chicks hatched, I reared eleven
to maturity, but unfortunately all of these, except four, have
turned out to be cocks. I separated all the cocks in October, as
they began to fight, the liens were paired off, and the odd cocks
placed in pens by themselves. I introduced a hen Ryper to one
of the young unattached cocks, and even in October he nearly
killed her with his attentions, so that I had to separate them
again ; however, if I cannot obtain some hen Grouse before the
Spring I shall try them again with Rypers, which I am convinced
are nothing more or less than Red Grouse, upon whom climatic
conditions have brought about changes of plumage, and I am
certain that all signs of the Ryper parentage could be bred out
of the hybrids in a very few generations.
With Grouse, as with all other birds, it is essential that the
food and water vessels should be kept scrupulously clean, they
are very apt to let their droppings fall in their water and food,
and it is very injurious for them to eat soiled food and drink
fouled water. Grouse deposit two distinct kinds of excrement,
the one dry and often quite hard, the other much more fluid and
looks like dark slimy paste. Some people think this latter excre-
ment is a sign of ill health, but that is an erroneous view, as a
matter of fact every healthy Grouse excretes both forms of drop-
pings, the dry firm droppings pass straight from the main gut,
and the soft pasty excrement follows shortly after from the caecal
appendices. The amount of excrement dropped by a Grouse
during one night is often very surprising.
Grouse, like all game-birds, delight in a good dust bath,
and this should always be provided in the shape of a heap of dry
sandy soil.
In concluding these notes it may be as well to give a brief
list of what is essential and what should be avoided.
Essential: Clean food and water; food to consist of wheat
and dari, also some heather (unless the birds when obtained have
been weaned from it by degrees), green food of some sort--
cabbage, lettuce, chicory, dandelion, grass, spinach, etc.--plenty
of grit, a dusting bath and as large an aviary as possible.

Editorial.
To be avoided: Full sun when young-, dirty food vessels,
the sudden appearance of strange dogs and cats, guard against
gapes as far as possible and overcrowding and subsequent fouling
of the soil.
All the aviaries should be rat-proof. I have found the
following method of dealing with rats most successful. Stop up
all holes for a night or two to find out which are used, then soak
a small piece of cotton wool with Carbon-Bisulphate, push it as
far down the hole as possible, leave it for two or three seconds
and then drop a match into it, there will follow a small explosion,
instantly block the hole up with a sod, and the inmate (either
rat, stoat or rabbit) will be poisoned by the fumes, care must be
taken not to inhale the fumes while blocking the hole; this
method may be employed with perfect safety in a crowded aviary.
EDITORIAL.
I should like to take this opportunity of tendering my
most hearty thanks to those members who have so considerably
helped me in my Editorial duties during the past year, by pro-
viding me with such interesting and often valuable " copy." In
the list of contributors will be found many names which have
not previously appeared there, as well as many old friends to
whom we are already under obligation. To both we send our
heartiest thanks, and hope they will consider it in the light of
the highest compliment that we unblushingly ask for more !
If only each member of the Society would send in just one article
in the course of the year what a delightfully easy post that of
Editor would become, and what a mass of information on avi-
culture would be recorded for future bird-lovers!
With the January number of last year we commenced
the series of articles on Practical Bird-Keeping, and, from the
appreciative letters received from our members, I am glad to
know they have been helpful and instructive. We have still two
or three more to add, and then our intention is to publish the
whole as a small Manual of reference.
It has been suggested that the next series of such articles

should deal primarily with the subject of Aviaries, and how best
to plan and lay them out for different species of birds. I would
much like to have the opinions of our members on this sug-
gestion, and would also be glad to receive offers of contributions
on the subject from both those members who have been fortunate
enough to have, through success, learnt what to aim at, and also
from those who, after many trials and failures, have learnt at any
rate what to avoid.
I think the subject should prove a good one, and informa-
tion derived from experience is always useful and of the utmost
value to those who are just commencing to go through the mill.
I suppose we can all of us remember the care and devotion spent
in our early avicultural days on buildings and cages, which have
afterwards turned out hopelessly unsuitable and disheartening,
and when we realize how easily we might have avoided waste
of money and time, we shall welcome the opportunity of enabling
others to take advantage of our knowledge. Even the expert is
not too old to learn, if he or she is a wise expert, and I think an
interchange of ideas of this very important part of aviculture
might prove of great advantage to one and all.
There is one other matter I would like to mention. In the
list of members it would seem that our numbers ate lower than
they were at this time last year, but in reality this is not so.
Our membership has increased, but on our books were the names
of certain numbers who had ceased to pay their subscription
but who had not sent in their resignation. Several of these had
gone abroad and not sent their change of address, and we have
considered them dormant, but after a due allowance of time we
have now removed their names, and if they wish to rejoin they
must pay a fresh entrance fee.
Financially, we are in a better state than we have been
for some time. At the beginning of the year a member most
generously offered to be responsible for any deficit we might
have up to ^io, and I am glad to say we have not been obliged
to call upon him for a single shilling. Nevertheless, there is no
denying that an addition of another fifty members would place
us in a very much more comfortable position, and those members

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE GREY THRASHER (Harporhynchus cinereus).
Sir, -- I have received a pair of these 'Threshers' (or Thrashers)
which are inhabitants of Mexico, I believe. They have a greyer tinge than
the Thresher which is found in the United States ( H. infiis)-- the Brown
Thresher as it is called. These birds are of the size of a Song Thrush, with
longisli curved bills and eyes which look as if they had been purchased at a
taxidermist's establishment, very yellow and staring with black pupils.
The chin is dull white, the upper plumage mouse brown with a greyish
wash, and the underparts spotted in a Thrusli-like manner, but the spots
are closer and more clouded.
The Thrashers are supposed to be good songsters, at any rate the
brown one of the United States has that reputation. Mine are very
sprightly birds, and seem to do well on an insectivorous mixture with some
fruit and a few mealworms. The male is distinguishable by a more curved
bill and a more thickly spotted breast, besides which the whitish chin is
more distinct. The tails of these birds are on the elongated side.
The Harporhynchi are classed with the family of the Mimiuse
(Mocking Birds). They are usually found in arid situations, placing their
large flattish nest of coarse twigs, leaves, fibres, bark, grass and moss, lined
with softer materials, in low trees or thorny scrub.
They are naturally shy birds, but would probably become tame in
captivity. They have strong feet, built for clinging well.
The generic title is deiived from the Greek apiryj, a sickle; and
pdyxos, bill. Hubert D. Asteev.

DESERT ISLANDS.*

Those, whose good fortune it is to visit out-of-the-way
corners of the world where Nature, untrammelled by man, still
holds undisputed possession, frequently, when writing of their
experiences, fall into one of two errors, either the book is so full
of their domestic worries and the difficulty they had in cooking
their breakfast or shooting their dinner that they quite omit to
adequately describe the country, or else they record in impersonal
language of unimpeachable scientific accuracy exactly what they
see, without investing the story with any touch of their own
personal thoughts or sensations.
Between these two extremes, Dr. Lowe has steered an
admirable course. Small personal details of no real importance,
except to lend a personal and human touch to the book are there,
but they are never allowed to intrude or take away from the
descriptions of the desert islands visited. To render the narra-
tive still more attractive, the author gives us an insight into his
own thoughts and speculations. His account, for instance, in
Chapter IX. where he discusses the all-important problem of
how bare rocks, rising from mid-ocean, came to receive their

terrestrial inhabitants is worth the careful thought of all in-
terested in such problems, whilst it is written in such a clear
style that the veriest tyro can understand the main features of
the problem. Another analogous point is discussed on p, 208,
where the author points out that three distinct species of Gannet
are found living and nesting under precisely similar environment,
and he asks pertinently why these species should, from the simi-
larity of their food, habits and environment as well as their
isolation, still have retained their individual characters and be
exactly similar to their relatives on the other side of the globe.
The answer to such questions is of course not possible in the
present state of our knowledge, but to emphasize such facts in a
book like the present not only adds to its charm but raises it
from a mere narrative to a book of scientific interest. The
islands described are all situated in the Caribbean Sea, and were
visited in Sir Frederic Johnstone's yacht. Birds form the author's
chief hobby, but details on all forms of life, from the minute
coral to the huge Devil Fish, are included.
Having ourselves sailed those seas and visited desert
islands, surrounded by living halos of birds and mythical halos
of buccaneers and buried treasure, we have been able to appre-
ciate to the full Dr. Bowe's narrative, which we can most strongly
recommend to any of our members who like to read of Nature
unspoilt by man.
THE OSPREY. *
This is another book of bird photos., uniform with those
of the Golden Eagle and Spoonbill. The Osprey can, unfor-
tunately, no longer be studied in Great Britain, but Americans
are more fortunate, and several large breeding colonies of this
species are to be found along the Atlantic coast, and a few
pairs still, so we are told, nest or try to nest within the limits of
New York City. In its gregarious habits during the nesting
season, and because it frequently nests low down or on the
ground, the American form lends itself to the needs of the

photographer, and Mr. Abbott has fully availed himself of these
opportunities.
The letterpress is well written in an entertaining fashion,
and contains several yarns about the home-life of the bird, as
told to the author by various fishermen and others with whom
he came in contact, though he does not of course vouch for their
accuracy in points of detail.
The feature of the book is the photographs, which are
excellent and have been beautifully reproduced. They show
young in all stages, from the time they leave the shell till they
are full grown and well on the wing, and there is also a varied
selection of photographs of nests, showing the many different
situations chosen, such as a small bare rock, standing out in the
sea, on the beach, on trees, on a fence and on a telegraph pole.
In fact, with the exception of a picture of the eggs, which ought,
we think, to have been included, the photographs give a graphic
description of the bird and its actions during the most interest-
ing period of the year, and to those interested in the habits of
birds, rather than their dried skins, we confidently recommend
this book.
THE GREAT AUK. *
The Great Auk owes much of its popularity as it became
extinct so recently that, prior to that event, enough was known
to whet the appetite for more, and in addition it was a British bird.
The pamphlet before us forms a most useful record of the sales of
its eggs or skins in England that have taken place during the last
hundred years. The highest price given was ^350 for the egg
which is now in the Royal Scottish Museum, and the lowest 12/-
or 17/- for an egg purchased for the British Museum in 1819.
Two notable bargains have been made in these eggs, two being
purchased in Edinburgh in May, 1880, for 32/- and sold on the
following July for .#207 2s. In the second case, two were bought
amongst a lot of 'shells and fossils' for 36/- in March, 1894, and
sold the following month for ^462 15s. ! The price of all eggs

We have received Part III. of Volume III. of this
important work, some of the previous parts of which have been
noticed in this journal. The present part deals with the Order
Accipitres, a group which is not of great interest to the general
run of avicultulists, as few of the birds of prey are really satis-
factory in captivity. When wild, however, this is the finest group
of all birds, and in Australia it is well represented.
Mr. North gives exhaustive accounts of the nesting habits
of the species with which he deals, with field notes from all
parts of the Commonwealth.
One of the most extraordinary of Australian raptorial
birds is the White Goshawk whose plumage is of the purest
white all over, rendering it extremely conspicuous, Mr. North
considers it one of the most useful of the Accipitres, feeding
largely upon insects, the contents of stomachs examined con-
sisting principally of this kind of food. It is, however, gradually
becoming scarce in many parts, its conspicuous plumage making
it an object of pursuit to the gunner whenever it is seen, a fact
which is much to be deplored.

is a great deal of matter therein which will provide instruction
for those of riper years, and whose knowledge of birds is not of
the most elementary character. The first chapter which is
headed " Where our Poultry came from " is really of great
interest as the author therein traces the history from remote
times of most of our domesticated species of birds, while in
"Birds under Water" he deals with the various swimming
attitudes of birds which procure their food beneath the surface
of the water, and their adaptation to their mode of life. There are
fifteen chapters dealing with such subjects as " Birds in Training,"
" Birds at Play," " Birds at School," " Birds at Night" and so on,
the book running to 235 pages.
The object of the book is to direct the attention of begin-
ners in ornithology to interesting subjects in connection with the
life of birds -- to make them observant, and we feel sure the book
will fulfil the object of its author.
It contains thirty-six illustrations, sixteen of which are
full-page in colour.

PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
XI.--THE FEET OF BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY.
By Katharine Currey.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998086" page_id="32659183"  page_num="103" year="" vol="">
Caged birds veiy often suffer in their feet, and, after many
years of bird-keeping, I have come to the conclusion that a bird's
foot can be made and kept quite sound and healthy (provided of
course there is no hopeless erippledom or disease) by fulfilling
two conditions--a constant supply of fresh earth , as well as sand
and giavel, and giving the bird the opportunity of changing the
position of its feet and toes.
A bird's foot needs exercise as much as a human hand.
Watch the wild bird in a tree, how constantly he changes the
position of his legs and feet. Now the foot is spread out; now
tightly clenched round a slender twig: now relaxed as he grasps
a bough ; now he hangs upside down, suspended by his feet;
now&amp;apos; holds on to a bough astant, one leg drawm up, the other

stretched out--always a change of position. If a hough is not
placed in a cage, then the perches should be of different sizes,
and some slanting, some almost upright. Fuither, I have often
noticed that a wild bird chooses a living branch to perch on in
preference to a dead one. Is it the electricity in the living
bough that responds, in some way, or the electricity in the bird's
foot, or is there a subtle warmth in the live wood that is agree-
able to the touch ? The fresh earth seems to me of almost equal
importance for the feet.
Earth has a magnetic healing influence, as well for birds
as for man, and I have found the effect of daily contact with fresh
earth wonderful for weak or suffering feet of birds I have kept.
That and the daily bath of fresh water; whereas the feet of birds
I have kept in an aviary with a cemented floor have not been in a
satisfactory state, though I kept the floor well gravelled.
An earth-floor to an aviary can be made rat-proof by a
small-meshed wire netting bottom to the aviary, two or three
feet below the ground. The easiest way of placing such an
aviary in position is to dig out the earth to the size of it, and
sink the aviary in, filling in the earth that has been dug out,
up to the level of the ground. The earth can be raked over
every day, and fresh earth added, and patches of grass laid in
part of it, forming a happy hunting-ground for worms.
I am quite sure that the more of natural surroundings we
can give the birds the healthier they will be. And we owe them
this if we deprive them of freedom.

Part I.
By Major Horsbrugh.
Having kept this curious bird in confinement and having
had, at the same time, oppoitunities of observing it in Nature,
the following notes will I hope prove of some interest to some
of our members.
Description. Its curious shape and plumage of grey and
black (well shown in the accompanying photograph of a bird in
Mr. St. Quintin's aviary) is too well known to need a detailed
description, and I need only note that the length of an adult
female Secretary Bird is about 58 inches. The male is slightly
smaller.
Distribution. It is found all over South Africa, wherever
the country is dry and open, and extends to Upper Egypt in the
North and Gambia in the West and Abyssinia in the East. Birds
that I have seen from Egypt had red ceres, while the South
African species had yellow ceres, so I presume the Northern
birds belong to a sub-species.
Habits. Secretaries in South Africa live in pairs as a rule ;
the same pair haunting the same big tract of country year after
year and using the same nest each season unless disturbed.
Even if the eggs are taken they will frequently lay again in the
same nest. The nest is a huge structure, placed as a rule in
some big camel-thorn or acacia, where it presents a landmark for
miles around. One nest, from which I took a young bird, its
sole occupant, was stiong enough to support my weight as I sat

in it, and was woven together almost as tightly as an English
Magpie's nest.
When the young are able to get their own living, the
parents follow the custom of other big Raptores, and drive them
off to find beats of their own.
The Secretary, as a rule, is entirely terrestrial, and must
cover many miles each day getting its food. They can, however
fly well, and I have occasionally seen them high in the sky,
soaring about like auy eagle or vulture. It is quite a common
sight to see a pair striding along with their easy stately walk,
each bird looking like an old gentleman in short black knicker-
bockers with his hands behind his back under his coat-tails.
Every now and then one will give a quick stamp on the ground
and slowly sit down on the whole length of the tarsi and pick up
a locust, beetle, or other small game. A mouse or lizard may
take cover in a tiny cactus or thorn clump, but he is doomed if
the quick eye of the great bird has seen him. Stalking swiftly
up he gives one side of the clump a sharp smack with his rattling
wing, bounding like lightning to the other side and bringing his
unerring foot on his game as it bolts.
Secretaries have enormous appetities. Some young ones I
reared would eat as many as nine doves (Turinr capicola or
senegalensis) each every day. These doves used to haunt the
Government Poultry Farm in Potchefstroom in hundreds and
devour the chicken food, and were shot by the manager and
thrown away till I put in a claim for them.
Secretaries are great egg-eaters. I came on the scene one
afternoon as one of my tame birds was finishing off a clutch of
nine guinea-fowl eggs he had discovered in the lucerne patch ; a
child, who was with me, remarked that it was like putting pennies
into a money-box as you could hear them clink as they went
down. No doubt in the wild state they are terrible foes to all
ground-breeding birds.
On account of their great activity and vast appetites they
require a big tract of country as a hunting-ground. I know of
various eyries that were occupied year after year in the Transvaal,
but none was within ten miles of another one.

Some Notes on the Secretary Bird. 107
In one case the nest was on top of a wild olive, and within
a hundred yards of it was the neat nest of the big Martial Hawk-
Eagle (A. bellicosus&amp;apos;), but as the latter bird is a hunter pure and
simple, living on entirely different kind of prey, the two hawks
never interfered with each other.
I cannot quite understand why the Secretary is dubbed a
vulture--he has nothing vulturine about him,--he kills his own
prey in his own fashion and tainted meat seriously upsets him.
I look upon him as a large ground Goshawk and not at all as a
vulture.
Mrs. Annie Martin, in her "Home-life on an Ostrich
Farm," gives a most interesting account of a tame Secretary
she kept, from which I will give an extract : --
"Jacob's (the Secretary's) enormous appetite, and our

" difficulty in satisfying it, were well known in the neighbour-
" hood, and the owners of several prolific cats, instead of drown-
"ing the superfluous progeny, bestowed them on us as offerings
" to Jacob.
"They were killed and given to him at the rate of one a
" day. Once, however, by an unlucky accident, one of them got
" into his clutches without the preliminary knock on the head;
" and the old barbarian swallowed it alive. For some minutes
" we could hear the poor thing mewing piteously in Jacob's
" interior, while he himself stood there listening and looking all
"round in a puzzled manner to see where the noise came from.
" He evidently thought there was another kitten somewhere, and
*"seemed much disappointed at not finding it. Jacob was largely
" endowed with that quality which is best expressed by the
"American word 'cussedness'; and though friendly enough
" with 11s, he was very spiteful and malicious towards all other
"creatures on the place. He grew much worse after we went to
" live up country, and became at last a kind of feathered Ishmael;
" hated by all his fellows, and returning their dislike with interest.
"Sometime after we had settled on our farm we found
"that he had been systenvatically inflicting a cruel course of i 11-
" treatment on one unfortunate fowl, which, having been chosen
" as the next victim for the table, was enclosed with a view to
" fattening, in a little old packing case with wooden bars nailed

Mr. W. H. St. QuinTin,
" across the front. Somehow, in spite of abundant mealies
" (Indian corn) and much soaked bread, that fowl would never
" get fat, nor had his predecessor ever done so ; we had grown
"weary of feeding np the latter for weeks with no result, and in
" despair had killed and eaten him at last -- a poor bag of bones,
"not worth a tithe of the food he had consumed.
" And now here was another, apparently suffering from the
"same kind of atrophy; the whole thing was a puzzle to us,
"until one day the mystery was solved, and Jacob stood revealed
"as the author of the mischief. He had devised an ingenious
" way of persecuting the poor prisoner, and on seeing it we no
" longer wondered at the latter's careworn looks. Jacob would
" come up to his box and make defiant and insulting noises at
" him-- none could do this better than he--until the imbecile
" curiosity of fowls prompted the victim to protrude his head and
" neck through the bars ; then, before he had time to draw back,
"Jacob's foot would come down with a vicious dab on his head.
"The foolish creature never seemed to learn wisdow by ex-
" perience, though he must have been nearly stunned many
" times, and his head all but knocked off by Jacob&amp;apos;s great power-
ful foot and leg ; yet as often as the foe challenged him, his
"poor simple face would look inquiringly out, only to meet
" another buffet.

"As he would not take care of himself, we had to move
" him into a safe place, where he no longer died daily, and was
" able at last to fulfil his destiny by becoming respectably fat."
Secretaries in South Africa breed during the winter months
(June and July). The usual clutch is three, but I once saw four
birds in a nest. The eggs are bluish white, sometimes marked
with rusty brown and occasionally quite plain. They measure
about 3 05 by 2&amp;apos;25. The young remain in the nest till well on to
the end of September as their legs are very weak and brittle,
and for a long time after hatching they cannot stand, but crawl
feebly about the big platform of a nest on the tarsus.

Sof/ie Notes on the Secretary Bird. 109
Part II.
By W. H. St. Quintin.
Major Horsbrugh has asked me to add some notes upon
"The Secretary Bird in Captivity," as an addition to his interest-
ing and amusing account of the bird, as seen in his African
home.
I have kept these birds for about four years, and the first
thing that struck me about them was their amazing appetites!
I have long been accustomed to keep raptorial birds large and
small ; and, as a rule, one may say that the larger the bird the
less frequent (imitating natural conditions) should be his meals,
though of course the meals, when given, must be full ones.
In one of our best private collections, where Eagles and Vultures
live for years and are ill the pink of condition, these birds are fed
on four days in the week, but as much as they like each time.
On the other hand, the smaller Falcons, Hawks and Owls must
be fed night and morning. But the Secretary Bird I soon found,
big as he is, does not look his best unless he has a good meal
twice a day, and pretty much what he can stow away each time,
including fur, feather and bone.
In a roomy enclosure, which can hardly be too big, he
takes an immense amount of exercise, striding up and down,
always on the look out for a mouse or other small quarry. Even
a Blue-bottle fly is not too insignificant for him, while a butterfly
causes great excitement, and is pursued across the enclosure,
stroke after stroke (of the foot) being aimed at the insect, which
is often knocked down and instantly devoured.
If more than one are kept together, they will at times race
about in graceful play, which is apt to degenerate into a squabble
at any moment, for their tempers are exceedingly short. When
in a hurry, they spread their wings wide and hold them at such
an angle that, when they stride against the wind, they are lifted
off the ground at the end of their run, and suggest the action of
an aeroplane, the motor being represented by the bird's legs
which, of course, are working energetically.
I pinioned my birds reluctantly, but I had no alternative,
for the} 7 are light and active, and a ten-foot netting fence is not
enough to stop them, unless the wing is shortened sufficiently;

and they are not to be trusted with anything smaller than a
pheasant, nor with eggs or young of any species.
My birds are largely fed on rabbit, given in pieces with
the fur and bone, also on any rats that are forthcoming, and
sparrows: in fact, on anything of an animal nature, so long as it
is perfectly fresh.
I have never offered them a snake, but an eel is treated
with much caution, and even after being killed by the usual
blows from the foot, receives many unnecessary thumps before it
is bolted. Although the bird evidently prefers small prey, at
least so small that it can be shaken down his capacious throat,
he will stand upon anything too big to swallow and tear pieces
off; but I doubt it being his usual practice when at liberty to kill
anything large.
I entirely agree with Major Horsbrugh that the Secretary
Bird shows nothing of the Vulture in its ways, but much more of
the Goshawk, as anyone who is familiar with the two birds will
soon remark.
One habit I notice, which is unusual amongst birds of
prejq is the Secretary Bird's attitude when roosting. He lies
down ; and my birds, a few minutes after they have been walked
into their shelter sheds for the night, may be seen lying on the
peat moss litter, In summer, when they are left out, they creep
under a bush or spruce fir, and crouch there for the night. The
foot is the bird's weapon, whether for disabling his prey or for
discomfiting his enemy. Before my other birds understood their
novel method of fighting, I have seen an inquisitive Stanley
Crane make a hostile demonstration against a " Secretary," only
to be thrown backwards a yard or two by the lightning stroke
delivered straight at his breast.
Now everything gives way to the Secretary Birds, though
I do not call them aggressive, nor even courageous, except with
creatures much smaller than themselves. Mine have several
times killed for themselves a water hen and eaten it ; and once
one got into a Wader's enclosure and killed a Whimbrel. But
I have seen one striding after a scared grey squirrel, keeping
within easy striking distance: but the bird could not make up
its mind to deliver its blow, before the little animal reached

cover. They are, of course, quick to kill a rat released from a
trap, aud lie generally gets a tap on the head before he has gone
many yards, which effectually settles him.
Unfortunately it is difficult to distinguish the sexes, though
as a rule the male is said, following the general rule in raptorial
birds, to be rather smaller than his mate. Otherwise I see no
reason why these interesting birds should not breed if suitably
fed and allowed plenty of room. A pair did lately build a nest
more than once at the Zoological Gardens, but they were inter-
fered with by some antelopes confined in the same enclosure.
Finally the female, in a high wind, managed to get into the yard
of the Ostriches, and was fatally injured by one of the latter.
Major Horsbrugh remarks that examples of this species
from Egypt had red ceres, instead of rich yellow, as in those
from further south. I have seen in my birds (from the Trans-
vaal) when much excited, a distinct pink suffusion showing
through the yellow skin ; in fact, it might be said that the bird
was blushing ! When in a quarrelsome mood, my birds draw
the skin of the forehead very tight and flat and elevate the cere ;
at the same time uttering a gruff roar or bellow, much more like
the voice of some angry mammal than that of a bird.
As I am uncertain of the sexes of my examples, I cannot
say if this is merely a challenge to combat or a form of sexual
display, but I am inclined to think that it is the latter, and that
I have two females.

By C. B. Ticehurst, M.A., M.R.C.S., M.B.O.U.
As the Storm Petrel ( Procellaria pelagicai) is not often kept
in captivity, I thought perhaps a few notes on one which I had
would be acceptable to the readers of the Avicultural Magazine.
On Nov. 29th, a very foggy day succeeding a foggy night,
I had two Storm Petrels brought to me alive, which had been
taken on board trawlers about twenty miles east of Lowestoft.
One of these died in two days; the other, which when first
brought in was quite lively and in good condition and even
pecked at everything near it, lived ten days, about the longest I

believe that one has been kept alive. I kept it in a big box in
my museum, and during the day it was allowed free use of the
room. At the outset the difficulty was to get it to feed ; I tried
it on shredded fish, meat, and fish liver, and even tempted it with
oil floated in a bath which, however, it would not touch. Fish
liver in small pieces seemed the best food. Although it picked
up the fish liver in its bill it never ate any, always shaking it out;
it however ate it if it was pushed well into the gape, and thus it
was fed four or five times a day ; finally the feathers round the
bill got very clogged with oil, and at the end I believe it got
some oil in the windpipe, as it suddenly drooped and died. On
opening it I found still a fair amount of subcutaneous fat.
I may say at once that the picture in Saunders' Manual is
a misleading one ; the Storm Petrel never stands at rest on the
webs, but on the whole length of its tarsus, in which position
also it frequently walks, or rather shuffles, the head and neck
being kept low ; as it gets up speed it gradually raises up on to
its webs, but in this position its balance is not good and the
wings are frequently raised, no doubt to maintain the balance
preparatory for flight. I clearly made out that there are two
methods of starting flight, the one by shuffling along on the
tarsi and then gradually getting up on to the webs and running
along with the wings beating rapidly, the other by rapidly beat-
ing the wings vertically and sliding backwards on the ground
or progressing backwards if in water ; in the latter method, I
believe an opposing wind to be necessary to help the bird, and I
frequently saw it try to fly by this method when close to the
door, under which a considerable draught was blowing.
When in the water (of which it seemed to be very frigh-
tened) the motion of the legs was very rapid and alternate, pro-
gress however was not quick, and the swimming backwards, as I
thought preparatory to flight, was frequently noted ; the bird
occasionally drank water, and, when swimming, the body " floats
high." It never succeeded, while I had it, in raising itself from
the ground, but if dropped from a height of some 18 inches
would take wing and fly round the room with an uncertain
fluttering flight, the wing strokes being short and somewhat bat-
like. However, another specimen I had took flight from the

floor of the same room on more than one occasion. Although it
was able to rise and steer itself in the air, it never seemed to
realize the presence of the wall, but would fly straight into it
and then flutter helplessly to the ground.
The bird always shunned light, and when at liberty in-
variably sought the darkest corner of the room, and always
seemed more lively towards evening. I believe the food is found
entirely by the sense of smell, and that vision, at any rate in
daylight, is poor, for when put in the neighbourhood of food it
obviously knew food was there, and, when close to it, it often
pecked at it, but in doing so made many bad shots at it before
taking it in its bill, The only noise I heard it utter was a soft
"chuck" when on one occasion I was holding it.
PET OWLS.
Bv Katharine Currey.
I have always loved Owls, and one of my early recollections
was a very tame Barn Owl. so tame that he came flying when
whistled for, and perched on onr shoulders or arm. He had a
tragic end, poor " Billy," for he fell down a chimney, and emerged
in the likeness of a Crow. He died soon after. I have kept
Tawny Owls for many years and they are enchanting pets and
most sagacious. "Duffles" and wife have lived very happily
for years in a very large aviary under some ancient yews, where
some sunlight can penetrate, but I think they need more. They
pei ch on the thick branches, and on some poles, and hide
behind the old stems. The wire-netting is large enough to admit
mice, and I feel sure they catch these for themselves, and also
probably young rats.
They are fed every evening, and have a pan of water in
case they wish to bathe, as they seem to enjoy a rainy day. They
have boxes to hide in during the day. I think their note is most
musical and pleasing, flute-like in its soft melody, and I cannot
understand why many people find it unpleasant. Alas ; some
days ago one escaped, by a pure accident. The gardener opened
the door to put in a mouse, and the Owl flying at his hand to get
it, missed and flew out. It tried to come back to its home, but
the rooks chased it away and I was in despair, for Owls are the

most devoted bird couples. Now a Wood Owl comes nearly
every evening and calls to its forlorn mate, and I think it must
be the lost Owl, so have had the aviary temporarily divided by
wire netting, and the door left open, hoping to entice it in. They
were perfectly happy in their home, and were able to take long
flights and go high up into the yews, and all the Owls in the
neighbourhood came to visit them.
Frequently, in winter, the hootings have sounded all over
the garden, among them the Barn Owls' screech and mew, and a
whistle which I have attributed to one of the Tittle Owls.
Owls have a keen sense of fun, like a dog and cat, and one
I had from its nest once used to play a sort of hide-and-seek
with us, running away (when its legs looked as if cased in thick
white stockings), looking round to see if we were coming, and
darting to hide behind a tree or in the box, and peeping out
warily.
I have alluded to my Owl as "It," as I have no idea of the
sexes, for they are as alike as two peas, and their notes seem to
be the same.

BREEDING OF THE INDIAN WHITE-EYE.

Zosterops palpebrosa.
By Wesley T. Page, F.Z.S.
Having been told that an account of the breeding of the
Indian White-eye will be of interest to my fellow members I
have much pleasure in inditing the following details.
I had long desired to possess this species, and in February
of last year, our esteemed member Capt. Perreau wrote that
he was sending me four pairs of this species and some other rare
Indian softbills. After a period of eager anticipation, just before
Easter (1911), I had the satisfaction of realisation, sadly curtailed
alas ! for only two of the birds shipped for me landed alive, and
these were two Z. palpebrosa --the bulk of the consignment perish-
ing in a severe blizzard which raged while they were passing
through the Bay of Biscay and to the mouth of the Thames.
From their travelling cage they went straight into the
outdoor aviary, and, although they had to endure frost on several

occasions, they settled down at once, and were quite at home in
a few hours. They are fascinating little creatures in a large
flight ; their demeanour and general characteristics being similar
to those of the English Gold-crest. They are out of doors to-day
(Dec. 6th), and there were seven degrees of frost on the grass
this morning, and they were certainly the happiest inhabitants
of the aviary.
As regards diet, they take a little of everything that is
in the aviary, including seed ; but their main diet is milk-sop,,
ripe fruit, small insect prey and occasional mealworms. They
are on the forage from sunrise to sunset, and now the leaves have
fallen, they make a fascinating picture as they run up and down
--creeper-wise--the bark of elder and hazel bushes (stems two
to five inches in diameter) searching for prey. During last
summer they delighted in a spar with Willow Wrens and Chiff-
chaffs through the netting of the aviary.
The\&amp;apos; had been with me some weeks before I was able to
determine that they were a true pair ; then I caught them carrying
bents into the elder tree, but could trace no signs of the beginning
of a nest. I only got occasional glimpses of them at this period,
the cover being very dense. On June 27th last, I noticed one of
them fly out from the top of a hawthorn bush, and a dangling
thread of hay led to investigation, and I then found a cradle-like
nest slung on the underside of the branch, containing a clutch
of three pale bluish-white eggs. Considerable skill was displayed
in the choice of a nesting-site, as owing to leaves above the nest,
it was sheltered from rain and sun--not even after a heavy
thunderstorm have I found the nest wet. The birds--for both
shared the duties of incubation--sat very closely and did not
leave their eggs unless one approached within a foot of their
domicile and did not return till the intruder withdrew.
The nest was somewhat like its builders, apparently fragile,
but really strong, and when the young had flown it was as clean
and perfect as when first discovered, save that the edges had
been a little trodden down by the parent birds while feeding
their young. The nest, a suspended pocket or cradle, barely
two-and-a-half inches in diameter by two inches deep, was typical
in all but material, and being constructed of hay, lined internally

with hay and a few feathers, was more bulky, ragged and clumsy
looking than the nest of the bird at liberty, but the difference
was only in material.
My data are somewhat doubtful, owing to the birds having
begun to incubate before the nest was discovered, but I think it
may be safely assumed that incubation had but just commenced.
The facts are :--
Nest containing three eggs, discovered on the evening of
June 27th.
Three chicks hatched early morning of July 7th.
Three fully-fledged birds left nest evening of July 17th.
Young birds fending for themselves August 1st.
It would appear that in this country the incubation period is ten
to eleven days; that the young leave the nest when about eleven
days old, and are competent to fend for themselves when about
twenty-six days old.
The newly-hatched fledglings were pinkish flesh colour,
quite naked and very minute. For the first four days they
were fed entirely 011 blight, flies and other small winged insects,
for which the parent birds foraged from sunrise to sunset : on
the fifth day they commenced to feed with small mealworms.
About every two hours I went into the aviary and saw that each
parent secured three, which were first killed and then taken to
their babies. O11 the morning of the tenth day they began to
carry fruit (banana and orange) to their chicks, but still fed with
as much live food as they could capture or I cared to supply.
The eyes of the chicks were open on the morning of the
fifth day.
The parent birds carried the faeces of the young several
times round the aviary, dropping it only when their movements
were obscured by the foliage.
I had a look at the fledglings twice daily, and even with
this regularity there was a noticeable increase in size at each
visit. Paying one of these visits at 7 p.m. on July 17th I found
the nest empty, though at 6.30 I had seen the three gaping beaks
stretched above the top of the nest and all three calling for food.
I could not trace them anywhere, and rather anxiously wondered
what had happened, but early next morning all doubt was dis-

pelled, and three, apparently robust, young Indian Zosterops were
disporting themselves for the first time in an English aviary.
In plumage, the young birds resemble their parents, but
are slightly greyer, and they did not wear spectacles till the
twenty-fourth day.
They are about the same size as the Gold-crested Wren.
The Mus. Cat. states 4.2 inches, this is evidently a skin measure-
ment (these often get stretched), certainly the living bird does
not appear more than 3J inches from beak to tip of tail.
I can discover no outward distinction in the sexes, save
that the male is a little bolder and a little more snaky about the
head and neck. Above, bright golden-olive-yellow, brighter on
the chin and throat, wings and tail-feathers brown with greenish-
yellow margins ; abdomen and flanks whitish-buffish-grey ; a
narrow circle of pure white feathers surrounds the eyes; bill
blackish, bluish at base; legs plumbeous.
Their distribution is every portion of India, from Murree
in the Hazara country to Sadiya in Assam, and southwards 011
the one hand to Ceylon and the Nicobars, and on the other to
Bhamo in Upper Burma. In the Himalayas the species is found
up to 7000 ft., and it occurs on the higher hill ranges of Southern
India (Oates).
In a state of nature it breeds according to locality, from
January to September, but April appears to be the month in
which most nests may everywhere be found. The nest is a very
delicate little cup made of vegetable fibres and cobwebs, sus-
pended in a fork of a small branch at all heights from the ground.
As regards aviary accommodation, these birds enjoyed a
naturally planted flight, 29ft. X 24ft. X 12ft. high, with a cosy
shelter attached, which they shared with the following species :

Geocichla pinicola.
By Hubert D. Astley, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I have received a true pair of this Geocichla , which I think
must be almost the first to be imported. This Thrush has never
been in the collection of the London Zoological Gardens. It is
an inhabitant of the pine-woods in the highlands of Mexico,
where Mr. Richardson found it nesting at a height of 8,000 feet.
It is also called Ridgwayia pinicola and Turdus poecilopte 7 &amp;apos;us.
This bird is about the same size as the better known
Orange-headed Ground Thrush (G. citrinal), but is quite different
in colouring. The male is dark umber-brown above, the feathers
on the head and upper back having paler brown centres. The
throat and breast are also dark blackish brown, the underparts
ashy white, to white. The wings are pied with white and pale
ash-brown, with geocichline markings, and the tail is tipped with
the same colour. The final feathers of the upper tail-coverts are
also white, giving the bird a decidedly pied appearance. Bill,
dark grey ; legs and feet, pinkish.
The female has the same pied markings, but where the
male is deep umber-brown, she is altogether lighter and more
spotted, so that the sexes are quite unmistakable.
Very little seems, according to Seebolun (Monograph of
the Turdidcs) to be known of this Thrush. My birds are at
present in a cage, and are quiet and inclined to be tame. Coming,
as they do, from the high pine forests of Mexico, they have pro-
bably as a species not been frightened by mankind. The family
to which they belong is an interesting one, and in many cases
are good songsters. My Pine Thrushes have a very melodious
call note, resembling a railway guard's whistle, blown softly; the
sound falling at the end.
Some lovely Geocichlce are found in Sumatra, Borneo, etc.,
with a bold mixture of bright chestnut, black, and white. They
are by no means altogether Ground Thrushes, although they are
fond of hopping about under bushes and shrubs, but my Orange-
headed Ground Thrushes perch quite as much as any other
-species of Thrush, and when they nested and successfully reared
a young one during the summer of 1911, they chose the very
highest spot they could find in the aviary in which to build.

Those few of our members who visited the tenth annual
exhibition of the Scottish National Cage Bird Society, held in
the Corn Exchange, Grassmarket, Edinburgh, on Dec. 30th and
Jan. 1st, were rewarded, as usual, by seeing various out-of-the-
way species of birds, not always on view either at a show of
cage-birds or at the " Zoo."
The British section numbered 3S6 entries all told, while
the Foreign section had 93, of which, however, 39 were of
continental Goldfinches and Bullfinches.
Apart from the commonly kept Finches and Buntings,
there were not quite a hundred British birds which would interest
our members, but amongst them were some species which I never
remember seeing alive, either in a state of nature or in confine-
ment, and which were for the most part in a condition that would
be worthy of wild birds.
The foremost place may be given to the female specimen
of the Dartford Warbler, shown by Messrs. Martin and Archer ;
surely the first time a Dartford Warbler had ever been seen alive
in Scotland. The bird seemed to feel the cold, although the
weather was very mild, for the hall was not artificially heated at
all, and at one time I thought this bird would have had to be
removed from the exhibition altogether. Along with it were
exhibited hens of the Bearded Tit, Grey Wagtail, Song Thrush,
Missel Thrush and Waxwing.
A remarkable bird was a lutino "Yellow-hammer" of a
pure yellow, as clear as a domestic canary; half-a-dozen others,
albino or semi-albino, were shown with it.
This year, the class for British Buntings contained but one
Meadow Bunting (Mr. A. W. Watson's), although I had once
seen four or five here, there was a Black-headed Bunting (the
continental Eviberiza melanocephala ) and two Ortolans, very
sleek but not very bright in colour: also Reed, Corn and Snow
Buntings.
The smaller insectivorous birds included a very beautiful
specimen of a Black Redstait, shown by Mr. Edmund Taylor, of

Mr. H. Goodchild,
Glasgow, who exhibited also a Common Redstart with it. A
charming specimen of the Tree Creeper, installed in a cage lined
with dark bine plush ! 1 interested others besides ornithologists.
A choice specimen of a Yellow Wagtail, other Redstarts, two
male Bearded Tits and a Sedge Warbler--the only Warbler in
the class --accompanied it.
One Shore Lark only was here, and that one was sent from
London ! The remaining British birds of interest were Choughs,
Hawfinches, Crossbills, Waxwings, and a solitary male Ring
Ouzel.
It was in the Foreign section, however, that most of the
interesting and beautiful birds were found ; and although, apart
from the Russian or Siberian Goldfinches and Bullfinches, there
were only fifty-four entries, these included some rare species.
Foremost amongst them was the Himalayan Blue Whistling
Thrush ( Myiophoneus temmincki ), also called Temminck's Whist-
ling Thrush, exhibited by our member Miss ##. G. R. Peddie
Waddell ; a species that I do not think has ever appeared at a bird-
show before. This particular bird was unfortunately rather ill at
ease in a show-cage, having been used to a much larger aviary at
home. An article on this species, by Mr. Astley, appeared in the
Avicultural Magazine for April, 1903, p. 196, with a black-and-
white plate of the bird, from a water-colour drawing by the
author, depicting it in a characteristic pose. Readers who wish
to see a description of the plumage, and an account of the habits
of this fine species are referred to Mr. Astley's article. The first
prize in this class went to a very sleek and silvery specimen of
the White-eyebrowed Wood Swallow (Artamus superciliosus&amp;apos;),
from Australia, shown by Mr. J. M. Walsh, to whom belongs
the credit of showing some of the choicest of the smaller birds
in the show. He also showed a pair of Black-headed Sibias in
fine condition. Miss Peddie Waddell also showed a Blue-cheeked
Barbet, but this bird was more nervous than the Whistling
Thrush, and I did not attempt to draw it for that reason, and
also a Greater Hill Mynah, one of the individuals lately at the
Zoo. Two Green Glossy Starlings, one of them exceptionally
glossy and beautiful, and a Green-billed Toucan, completed the
class.

In the class for Parrakeets, the first prize was awarded to
a bird described in the catalogue as an "Adelaide." which it
certainly was not. The species it most resembled was the Tas-
manian or Yellow-bellied Parrakeet ( Plalycercus flavivenIris&amp;apos;)
("Parrakeets," p. 164), but it differed from that in having a sub-
dued yellow collar and having broken red on the breast. I set
it down at the first glance as a hybrid, and have no doubt in my
own mind that it was a cross between a Barnard's Parrakeet and a
Rosella. This bird was placed in front of Miss Peddie Waddell's
beautiful pair of Black-tailed or Rock Peplar Parrakeets (Polytelis
melanura ), the male of which had an outer tail-feather rather out
of place and chafed, at the time of judging. This pair of birds
was otherwise perfect and in very sleek condition -- the best
specimens of the species I ever saw. Miss Peddie Waddell also
showed a Malaccan Parrakeet (Palceornis longicatida ) a male in
perfect condition and very tame. Other birds in the class were
Pennants, Blood-rumps, King Parrakeet, Black-cheeked and
Peach-faced Rove-birds and a Blue Mountain Lorikeet.
The class for the short-tailed Parrots only contained three
birds. The first, a Ceram or Red Lory, a very good bird ; a
Senegal Parrot and a Blue-fronted Amazon.
The Waxbill, etc. class, was, as usual, remarkable rather
for the pink of condition in which the birds were, than for any
rarity of the species. The first prize going to a pair of the
charming Orange-breasted or Golden-breasted Waxbills. The
other seed-eating birds included the Melba Finch (the bright-
ness of whose colouring cannot be indicated in a black-and-
white drawing), a Green Cardinal (which seemed to me to be
colour-fed), Cuban and Bicheno Finches, Crimson Finch, " rufi-
cauda&amp;quot; Finches ( Bathilda ) and a Paradise Whydah--a very good
bird, well staged.
Amongst the Tanagers, etc., the gems of the class were a
Yellow-winged Sugar-bird ; while an exquisite Black-throated
Tanager, a Maroon, and a Tricolor were exhibited by Mr. J. M.
Walsh. One of the most interesting was Miss Peddie Waddell's
Blue-winged Fruitsucker.

MANDARIN DUCKS AT LIBERTY.

<bodyText confidence="0.98779825" page_id="32659212"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
Sir,--T his last summer, as we had many Mandarin Ducks, we did not
take the eggs but left them to the old birds to rear. The nests were as
usual in holes in trees; many of them a long way from home and high
up in most inaccessible places. All the young got down, or rather got
themselves down, and what I want to draw your attention to is the extra-
ordinary activity of these little ducks when first hatched.
To begin with, some of these nests were at least two feet down a
perpendicular hole in a tree; the young to have got out must have jumped
up that height. A brood of young ducks covered a mile as the crow flies,
partly through standing corn, the day the}&amp;apos; were hatched, in little over an
hour ! The young ones were able to leap from the water on to a branch
eighteen inches high when a day or two old, and it was very pretty to see
an old duck fly on to a branch and the young leap up one after the other
and range themselves along the branch; one or two would generally jump
on to the old duck's back. The old ducks did not spend all their time with
their broods, but flew away for hours at a time. When returning, they flew
low through the trees with great rapidity, dodging in and out amongst the
branches like a Woodcock, and calling loudly all the time; the young
would hear her coming and swim out from where she had left them, and
look about to see where she was coming from.
The pair of Pintailed Sandgrouse that I reported as nesting early in
the summer, hatched and reared three young--two &lt;?, one $ , -- all of which
are flourishing. The cock parent was hatched here fourteen years ago next
June. K. G. B. Mradk-Wardo.

found one egg clear, and nearly fully-formed young in the other two, but
decomposed. Hubert D. Asteey.
A SUGGESTION.
Sir, -- The description, in our January number, of a Roccolo m Italy,
and of the diabolical wholesale " murder of the innocents," and the bar-
barous cruelties inflicted on the wee feathered pilgrims, must make the
hearts of all bird-lovers ache with grief, and their blood boil with fury and
disgust, as it does mine.
Can nothing be done by us to help to stop, for good and all, such
hideous barbarity, such cold-blooded destruction of beautiful life? Could
we, members of the Avicultural Society, each one of us, sign our names to
a petition and send it up to the King of Italy ? What is the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Italy doing, or rather not doing, to
allow such things. The Society, backed by Queen Margherita, has done
good work in Italy among the animals, why should the birds be neglected ?
Such things are impossible to understand.
I have been living now for over two years in Switzerland, and the
absence of bird-life in this country, especially round about the Rhone
Valley is sadly noticeable, and I think Italy must be greatly to blame for
this. We must also blame the Swiss, for it is only just lately they have
discovered that by eating the small birds their vines are so terribly visited
by insect pests that in some districts the} 7 have had to uproot them whole-
sale and sell the land for building purposes. Nozu, there is a law against
destroying the small birds, and the people would be only too glad to see
them increase in Switzerland.
There is the hateful gun here, too, and if something is not done to
prevent it, the big brown Ragle will be a thing of the past in the Canton of
Valais, where it is shot whenever it can be got at.
My fellow-members, could we all sign a petition such as I have
mentioned ? Would it be possible for Professor Giacinto Martorelli, head
of the Turati Collection in the Natural History Museum at Milan, who, as
Mr. Astley tells us, is doing such splendid work in that way, to write it for
us, and send it up to the King and Queen Elena, who, I believe, has a very
kind heart. Will somebody second my proposal ?
Alice Hutchinson.
[We print with pleasure Miss Hutchinson's letter, but we feel that
for the Society to take any active part in attempting to suppress the bird
destruction in Italy would be beyond its legitimate scope. At the same
time we shall be pleased to forward to Professor Martorelli any opinions
members may care to send in. The knowledge that this destruction has
attracted the attention of bird-lovers abroad may strengthen his hands.

The arrivals at the Gardens since my last notes were
written for the December number have not been numerous or
of great importance, and very few birds that are new to the
collection have been received. Perhaps the most beautiful is a
Rainbow Bunting * (Cyanospiza leclancheri), a lovely species from
Mexico, with sky-blue back and canary yellow underside. Those
who have visited the bird shows during the last two years will
be familiar with it, because a specimen belonging to Mrs.
Tinniswood Miller, probably the first ever brought to England,
has been shown several times.
The series of Hornbills has been enriched by a fine speci-
men of the Indian Concave-casqued form (Dichoceros bicomis),
one of the largest of the group. It has been placed for the
winter in the Small Bird House where it can be seen to much
better advantage than in the Eastern Aviary, where the Horn-
bills are generally kept, but where the temperature is too low
at this time of year for new arrivals.
By exchange with the New York Zoological Society, we
received three species that are new to the Gardens, namely, a
pair of Cuban Banded Woodpeckers (Nesoceleus fernandince), a
single example of the Cuban Green Woodpecker (Xiphidiopicus
percussus ), and a pair of Black-throated Crested Quails (. Eupsy-
chortyx nigrogularis&amp;apos;) from Central America.
From South Africa we have received six examples of a
species of Zosterops, which is new to the Society's list, namely,
Z. viretis, the Cape Green White-eye ; as well as a single example
of the South African Red-winged Starling (Amydrus morio ) also
new, and a Cape Robin-Chat (Cossypha caffra). The last is a
singularly beautiful bird, olive-brown above with rufous tail and
throat, black cheeks and conspicuous white eye-stripe. It is
the second example the Society has possessed, the first having
been presented by Major Horsbrugh some few years ago.
Another recent arrival is a young Cassowary, but it is
impossible at present to determine the species, as we do not

Members of the Crow family have been for ages, and still
are, favourite pets in this country. Their vivacity, power of
mimicry, and the comparative ease with which they are kept,
recommending them to many who do not care for birds in
general. They have the reputation of being very long-lived,
and in many cases this is correct, but I do not consider that
they are suitable cage-birds as a rule. All are birds of high
intelligence, extremely active, and many of them are hardly
ever quiet. They are best suited to roomy aviaries or semi-
liberty. Under these conditions they thrive for years, and do
not seem to mind confinement in the least, as they make friends
with man, and amuse themselves in a variety of ways. All seem
to pair for life, and are devoted couples.
The power of mimicry is by no means confined to tame
individuals; both wild Jays and Magpies may be heard amusing

themselves by imitating various local cries. In many places I
have heard our common Jay hooting and calling exactly like
the Brown Owl, whose cry has evidently, and probably with
reason, impressed itself very much.
In one of our w 7 oods the favourite song of the Jays in
spring (for it is in spring that all these strange cries are mostly
uttered) is the call of the male common Sheldrake. No Shel-
drakes have been kept there for at least ten years. Yet the cry
has not been forgotten, and has probably been handed down to
the young from year to year, but I do not recollect to have heard
that cry except in that particular wood.
The Crow tribe are practically omnivorous, and will not
thrive on any one food ; unfortunately for them they are more
carnivorous in spring and early summer. The Raven appears
to be the most carnivorous, but even he must have abundant
variety in his diet. None of them are birds that have a feed and
fill themselves ; all are birds that are feeding on and off the
whole day. Food is buried and dug up again, hidden in trees,
covered over with clods of earth, but I don't believe that any
hoard is ever forgotten. I can imagine no worse way of feeding
these birds than one which is commonly adopted, viz., to give a
lump of raw flesh ! If flesh is given it should be either in the
form of a bird or mouse, or a skull or bone, or in some cases,
such as the Cissas, tropical Jays, etc., finely chopped meat mixed
with other food, mealworms, etc. Eggs, so popular in a wild
state, do not seem to be much relished in captivity, at any rate
by some species, and I have given Starlings, Blackbirds and
Thrushes eggs, day after day, to Choughs, Azure-winged Mag-
pies (Cyanopica look?&amp;apos;), Siberian Jays, etc., and they took little
notice of them.
All the Crow tribe are very great bathers, and must be
most liberally supplied with fresh water. With plenty of exercise
and occupation they are hard) 7 , but naturally require a good
thoroughly sheltered house to retire into at night.
Although many species have some raucous unpleasant
cries, all have some charming modulated notes. The Raven will
warble like a Blackbird, and also ventriloquise, so will the

Carrion Crow. The Siberian J ay* (.Perisorem infaustus ) of which
I wrote an account in the early days of the magazine, has many
most musical cries. I do not recollect to have seen one of these
charming birds in captivity since we had our pair, which lived
for many years; these would eat mice and mealworms, bnt were
also great consumers of currants, sultanas, etc. All the true
Jays are very fond of acorns. I believe no true Jay is found
where there is no oak.
In conclusion, I would urge that those who keep any of
these birds, should confine them in roomy aviaries or keep them
in semi-confinement. Remember that they like to be taken
much notice of, are great bathers, are omnivorous, and they are
not as a rule suitable companions for other birds. I think an
exception may be made of the Choughs, but even they are best
kept by themselves.
I do not think many of these birds have bred in confine-
ment. Most of them are very shy at the breeding time. The
Raven of course has bred at Lilford and repeatedly atScampston.
The Chinese Blue Magpie has bred in the Zoological Gardens
and the Spanish Blue Magpie at Lilford, and the latter built most
beautiful nests and laid clutches of clear eggs, on which they

IN CONFINEMENT.
By Pelham T. L. Dodsworth, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.,
Member of the Bombay Natural History Society.
In an interesting article entitled "Green Pigeons" ( Cro-
copus pheenicopterns and Crocopus chlorogaster), contributed to the
columns of the Madras Mail , dated the 30th June, 1911, Mr. D.
Dewer makes, among others, the following remarks: --
(a) " The natives, or at any rate some of them, assert that the
bird never descends to the ground, because when its foot
touches the earth, the bird loses a pound in weight, in
other words, shrivels up into nothingness. If asked how
it drinks, they will reply that it settles on a reed which
bends with its weight, so that it is able to partake of
the water beneath without touching the earth. I11 the
absence of a conveniently situated reed, the Green Pigeon
overcomes the difficulty by carrying a twig in its feet.
It would be interesting to discover the origin of this
story, etc."
(fr) "Green Pigeons are said to be far less obtrusive in their
courtship than the majority of their kind. The male
does not puff himself out after the manner of other cock
pigeons, but is content to bow before his lady love, and
in this attitude move his expanded tail up and down."

Mr. Pelham T. D. Dodsworth,
obscure points in regard to the habits of wild birds by observing
the behaviour of their brethren in captivity, the following par-
ticulars about a pair of Kokla Green Pigeons (Sphenocercus
sphenurus )--a very closely allied species to the birds mentioned
in Mr. Dewai's article--which were taken from a nest when quite
young, and reared by hand, may, perhaps, be of some interest
to readers of this Magazine.
Before entering into details, I will preface my notes with a
few general remarks on the habits, distribution, etc., of this
species. The Kokla or Wedge-tailed Green Pigeon is a common
summer visitant to the North-West Himalayas, south of the first
snowy ranges, arriving from Nepal and farther eastwards about
the last week in April, or the beginning of May, to breed, and
then returning to their old haunts about September, or as autumn
sets in. During their summer sojourn in these mountains, they
are generally to be found along the outer ranges, at elevations of
4,000--7,000 feet, but are most common at about 5,000 feet. They
principally affect well-wooded and shady dales, hill-sides, valleys,
and glens, and are not so gregarious as the Green Pigeons
mentioned by Mr. Dewar, which are to be found in large flocks,
sometimes numbering as many as thirty to forty individuals, and
even more. Our birds are to be seen either singly or in pairs, or
in small parties of three or four. They are strictly arboreal, and
are exclusively frugivorous. They are very partial to the ripe
berries of the Kctiphul {Myrica sapinda). "When hunting for fruit,
they are continually gliding about the branches, like squirrels ;
and, from their strong feet, they can hang over to seize a fruit,
and recover their position at once by the strong muscles of their
legs. When perfectly quiet they are very difficult to observe, from
the similarity of their tints to that of leaves." They are heavy
feeders, and generally seek their meals early in the mornings and
late in the afternoons. To avoid the heat, they retire during the
middle of the day to some shady trees, where, hidden amongst
the foliage, they sit motionless, and spend the time dozing;
occasionally one wakes up and utters its soft, plaintive whistle,
and it is by these alone that the birds betray their presence.
Their flight is rapid and strong. I11 their nesting habits they are
more or less similar to those of the other Green Pigeons found in

on some habits oj the Kokla in confinement. 131
various parts of India. They are of course monogamous, and
lay the usual two white eggs of the Dove-type, on nests which
are clumsy structures of a few dry twigs loosely put together,
without any lining, and which are placed either in bushes, or on
trees at various heights from the ground. Some other details in
connection with their nidification which I have observed&amp;apos; are :
the period of incubation lasts from eighteen to nineteen days ;
the bird begins to brood after the first egg is laid, and both
birds share in making the nest and hatching the eggs. Both
birds also share in feeding the young. The latter leave the
nest in about three-aud-a-half weeks. The old birds are very
close sitters, not only when the eggs are fresh, but also when
the young are fully fledged. I remember on one occasion
finding a nest, placed on the horizontal branch of a large oak
about 40 feet high, in which the old bird was sitting very hard.
Thinking that the nest contained either hard set eggs or very
young ones, I decided to leave it alone and examine it a few days
afterwards. During the course of the following week, I visited
the nest again, and noticed the old bird sitting in it. O11 climb-
ing up to the nest, my astonishment can Ire imagined when I
saw the old bird fly off, followed by two young, fully fledged !
Another curious feature about these birds is that, as their eggs
and young suffer largely from the depredations of Jungle Crows
( Corvus macro)\0x25A0hynchus&amp;apos;), they sometimes show considerable in-
telligence in availing themselves, during the breeding season,
of the protection afforded them by the more quarrelsome and
powerful species. Now the Dicrnri are notoriously pugnacious
during the breeding season, never allowing Crows, Kites, et hoc
genus omne ever to approach within their "spheres of influence,"
and it is, therefore, not at all unusual to find nests of the Kokla
in close proximity to those of Drongos. The former belonging
to the nests are always allowed free access and regress to the
tree, but it is very different when a stranger shows himself in the
vicinity. In one particular instance that I happened to witness
it was an unfortunate Black-throated Jay ( Garrulus lanceolatus ),
which unknowingly approached too close, and was handled so
severeW by the Drongos that it soon had to make itself scarce.
The male Kokla is by far the handsomer bird, and the

Mr. Pelham T. L. Dodsworth,
female looks quite dull compared with him. The prevailing
colours are dull leaf-green and yellow-green or orange, with a
sprinkling of ash and maroon above, but there is nothing gaudy in
the plumage : each shade blends wonderfully with the others, and
to really appreciate the bird, one must have it in the hand. In
my opinion, the descriptions of the Kokla, which are given in the
various text books on Indian Ornithology, convey only a faint
impression of the bird's plumage, but I prefer Bianford's account
to that of any other : " Male. Head, neck, and lower plumage
yellowish green, tinged with rufous on the crown, and with
orange and a wash of pink on the upper breast ; upper back
greyish, passing into maroon-red on the middle of the back and
lesser wing-coverts ; rump, upper tail-coverts, median and large
wing-coverts, and exposed portion of tertiaries olive-green ;
primaries and secondaries blackish, both they and the greater
wing-coverts narrowly bordered outside with yellow; upper sur-
face of tail olive green like rump, the outer feathers more and
more grey, lower surface of wings and tail dark grey; lower
flanks and thigh-coverts dark green with pale yellow edges;
lower tail-coverts varying from pale cinnamon to buff. The
female lacks the orange on the crown and breast, and the maroon
on the back and wings, the latter parts being dark green like the
rump ; under tail-coverts dark green with broad buff borders."
The bill is dull smalt-blue, the horny portion pale blue;
the orbital skin pale smalt ; the hides with an inner ring of pale
bright blue, and an outer ring of buffy pink; the tarsi and feet
are coral red ; and the claws light-brown horny, darker at tips.

on some habits oj the Kokla in confinement. 133
On the istjuly, 1910, one of my egg-hunters brought me
a pair of these birds, about a fortnight or three weeks old, from a
nest which he had found, in the neighbourhood of Simla (N.W.
Himalayas), placed on one of the outer branches of a large
oak, at an elevation of about 6,300 feet. The young Koklas were
immediately taken in hand by my wife, and rearing operations
commenced. On being handled at first they would slightly raise
the wing, nearest to their supposed enemy. They were kept in
a small wooden box, lined with some straw and grass, and were
fed about five or six times a day, exclusively on small pieces of
ripe plantains, which had to be thrust down into their mouths.
A little water used occasionally to be poured down their throats
after the last meal in the evenings. When they were almost
fledged, they were transferred to a cage containing two Doves
{Turtur ferr ago), which had also been taken from a nest, and
were being reared by the hand.
By about the end of September the Koklas appeared to
be full grown ; and their irides, which were hitherto brown or
greyish-brown, now assumed the characteristic colouration of the
adult bird, viz., a pale blue ring followed by an outer ring of red.
As far as I can now recollect the birds had, up to this, uttered
110 note of any kind. As the migratory period of this species
had now arrived, I was anxious to see whether my birds would
exhibit those symptoms, which are usually displayed by roving
birds when in confinement, but no such indications were observed.
The Koklas were as dull and inactive as ever, and seemed quite
reconciled to their home.
Towards the latter end of the following November, the
cock began uttering his notes, but these were incomplete, or, in
the language of bird-fanciers, he was only " recording." These
"half" notes were generally uttered late in the evenings between
seven and eight p.m.
During the winter the birds throve excellently. Their diet
still consisted of pieces of plantains, which they would accept
sitting on their perches, and only from the hand of their mistress.
If the fruit was placed in the cage it was never touched. They
were fed about four or five times a day. They always drank
water from a cup, which, like their food, had to be held up to

Mr. Pelham T. L. Dodsworth,
their mouths. When hungry, the birds always became very
active, hopping about from perch to perch and peering anxiously
at their mistress, if she happened to be standing near their cage.
If no notice was taken of them, or she walked away from the cage
without feeding them, they would settle down into their usual
lethargic condition, but immediately renewed their activities on
catching sight of her; the presence of strangers or of others in
the house was entirely ignored by the birds.
I will now deal with the popular native beliefs mentioned
by Mr. Dewar that Green Pigeons never descend to the ground,
and that when they have occasion to drink, they either settle on
a slender reed close to the water, or carry a twig in their feet.
These stories are, to the best of my knowledge, prevalent through-
out the whole of Upper India, and referring to them in his " Birds
of Lucknow Civil Division," Geo. Reid remarks (S.F. Vol. X., p.
59): ''Beall these 'yarns' as they may, it is a rare occurrence
to see a Green Pigeon on the ground--still rarer to see it drink-
ing." With reference to this, Hume appended the note : "But
do they ever drink? I think not." Blanford adds, (Fauna, Birds
of India, Vol. IV., p. 6) that he cannot recollect ever seeing
these birds drink. Against these opinions we have that of
Jerdon, who states emphatically (Birds of India, Vol. III. p. 449)
that the birds ( Crocopus chlorogaster&amp;apos;) " come in large parties,
generally about nine a. 111., to certain spots on liver banks, to drink ,
and after taking a draught of water, occasionally walk a few steps
07 L the danip sand, appearing to pick up small pebbles, pieces of
gravel or sand." The italics are mine. Now it is by no means
easy to steer one's course amidst this formidable array of con-
flicting statements expressed by the leading Indian ornithologists.
It is out of the question to suppose, even for a moment, that
Jerdon could possibly have been mistaken, while, on the other
hand, it seems extraordinary that, if Green Pigeons were habitual
drinkers, the point should have escaped the observations of such
acute ornithologists as Hume and Blanford. Whether the rest
of the species of Green Pigeons also have particular spots where
they descend to the ground to drink water, or whether the juice
from the berries and fruit, which they feed on, suffices to quench
their thirst, I know not, but certain it is that the pair of my

on some habits oj the Kokla in confinement. 135
birds in confinement showed the most intense aversion to descend
from their perches, and would never do so if they coitld possibly help
themselves. Moreover, for years past, I have been closely observ-
ing the various species of Green Pigeons, and must have shot, at
one time or another, some hundreds of them, for they are good
table birds, but have never up to this seen a single one on the
ground. And what is more, I have never yet seen one in the wild
state drinking water. Natives are by no means poor observers,
and I must confess that it seems to me, while rejecting most of
their story, that there are good grounds for thinking that Green
Pigeons are seldom seen on the ground, and the probabilities are
that most of them iive without drinking. That some species of
birds do live and thrive without water there can be no possible
doubt. Bartlett, in his " Wild Beasts in the Zoo," instances
several such cases. All the known species of Parrots can be
kept in captivity for years without water and "continue in the
most robust health and beautiful feather condition." The little
Parrakeets, which are exported from Australia in thousands,
thrive without water and arrive at their destination in splendid
condition " if kept 011 Canary seed only." Writing in 1881,
Bartlett remarks: " At the present moment may be seen at the
Parrot House of the Zoological Gardens, a Greater Vasa Parra-
keet, presented by the late Mr. Charles Telfair, July 25th, 1830;
therefore this bird has lived in the Society's possession 51 years
without being supplied with water. It must be borne in mind
that the food supplied to birds of this kind is pretty moist, etc."
In conclusion, Bartlett adds that he once saw a large collection
of Indian Quails in the very finest state of health, that had had
no water since they left India, and the only food which had been
supplied to the birds was dry millet seed.
Since writing these notes, I think it only right to mention
that my friend, Mr. T. G. B. Waugh, has informed me that early
one morning, while watching for deer in the Ambala Division,
he saw a Green Pigeon, probably Crocopus chlorogaster , settle at a
small stream, and drink water.

BULLFINCHES.

finch as a pet. One of the most interesting of British wild birds,
so full of character, wilful, impulsive, devotedly affectionate and
fiercely jealous. And his sweet, soft song, a little plaintive--as
so many sweet songs are--and yet cheery, as he flirts his tail
from side to side, and bows and twists himself about while
whistling the little airs.
I have kept the larger and smaller species ; the former I
brought from Austria, a beautiful bird, living, or rather existing,
in a tiny cage hung against the house of a wood-cutter. He
was regaling himself on privet-berries, of which bullies are
inordinately fond. I have until now always found that the cock
Bullfinch prefers single blessedness in confinement, as the hen
truly deserves her name of " bully " and will not let him eat. A
little pair I have now are very united, though the cock is old and
has a poor little crushed foot. His mate seems to like him all
the better for it, and, when he sits on the perch in evident dis-
comfort with his foot, she flies to him with a tit-bit.
A striking instance of the attachment of even a wild bird
not hand-reared to its cage-home happened some months ago.
Three years ago, a cock Bullfinch I had had for a few
years escaped, and I consoled myself with the thought that as
all the other bullies I had kept, that had accidently flown out of
their cages, had come back generally after a short time this one
would follow their example. But this Bullfinch was attracted
by some fruit in the garden, and flying to some distance lost his
way home. It happened that he used to sing a peculiar little
song with three airs in it and I used to whistle these to him and
he answered. Although he replied to my call, however, he flew oft
further and further and never returned until last summer, when
as I was in the garden, I heard a Bullfinch's note ; I whistled, and
he piped back--that unmistakable plaintive whistle of the bully!
Nearer and nearer he came, and then I whistled the little song
with the three airs. He answered, and flew straight to me and
to liis old cage on the lawn. It was my long-lost pet! But as
he had had his freedom for so long I would not deprive him of it

as I thought he probably had a mate and little home somewhere
near. He came every day and fed out of a little saucer of seed
placed upon his old cage for him, and once he flew into the cage
and sang as of old.
I have other Bullfinches in the cage now, and he has flown
on to the wire roof, sung to the hen, and tried to get at the cock
to do battle. Then he came with a mate, and I am hoping they
may come back as winter draws on, but he has not been seen
since November. He used to fly about at breakfast-time and eat
crumbs off the table, singing and whistling. I fear he may have
been shot or trapped, as it is not understood in this country how
much good the Bullfinch does to a garden, even if he does help
himself to a little fruit occasionally by way of reward.
THE PARSON BIRD.
By John William Ainley.
This bird is credited with three distinct names, viz. : Poe
Bird, Tui, and Parson Bird. It is a native of New Zealand, and
in size about like that of our English Blackbird, measuring S|
inches from tip of beak to end of tail, of which the tail comprises
about 2\ inches. The Poe Bird is, broadly-speaking, black
all over, with these exceptions, the primaries are of a metallic
hue, while on either side of the throat is a little bunch of white
feathers, which the bird at its option can draw together and
thus form one single hanging tie, hence the name Parson Bird.
From the base of the skull, right down the back of the neck
falling well on to the shoulders, is a complete network of feathers
curved as seen at the tip of an ostrich feather, only on a minia-
ture scale.
I kept my Poe Bird in a cage a little over 4ft. long by
2ft. 6in. deep, and I think a cleaner insectivorous bird no one
can possess, for the moment he saw his bath he was impatient to
be in it. I do not ever remember seeing him feed on the cage
bottom, as he invariably fed hanging head downwards from his
perch. His song was different from that of any other bird that I
have heard, and when commencing to sing one would have
thought the bird was choking, yet still his song was sweet and

lasting, in fact lie would sing till the tongue became swollen,
when a little honey would soon right matters.
The Poe is a brush-ton gued bird and easily catered for, if
kept under proper conditions, the main things being plenty of
room for exercise, cleanliness, regular bath and not over-feeding.
Should the latter be abused by over stimulating foods the bird
will have fits, which must be checked by sprinkling him with
cold water, then giving him a dose of magnesia and reducing his
food on to a plainer diet.
I kept my bird in constant song and in the best of plumage
on the following diet: 8ozs. boiled bullock's liver grated, 8ozs,
sponge cake, 40ZS. best ants' egg, 30ZS. flake egg and 2 ozs. honey.
O11 alternate days I gave boiled potatoes mixed with a little flake
egg, also fruit in abundance. I have seen it extract juice from
an orange until the same was completely dried up, and yet never
leave a tiace that the orange had been tampered with. He was
also fond of a few mealworms, but feed sparingly and you have
in a Poe Bird one of the finest gems that an aviculturist need
wish for, although it is a long while since I saw one on offer.
It has never been my luck to possess a hen.

<bodyText confidence="0.955621" page_id="32659236"  page_num="138" year="" vol="">
By D. Seth-Smith, F.Z.S.
The Annual Show of the London and Provincial Orni-
thological Society was held at the Crystal Palace from the 2nd to
the 6th of February, dates which coincided, as it happened,
with some of the coldest weather that we have experienced in
the South of England for some years, and as I journeyed down
to Sydenham on the first day of the Show, in an unwarmed
railway carriage, I felt very thankful that I was not the owner
of any birds at the show in such weather.
The authorities did their utmost to provide and maintain
a suitable temperature for the more delicate birds, but I noticed
that the exhibitors who had sent such delicate subjects as Sun-
birds were careful to place their cages against the hot pipes. It
is certainly the worst time of the year for a show of foreign birds,
but since these have to join forces with Canaries and British

birds, and the Canaries at least are occupied with family cares or
their change of costume during the warmer months of the year,
there seems nothing for it but to hold bird shows during the
winter months. But the fact that such shows are badly supported
by foreign bird owners does not mean that foreign birds are
unpopular, but that the owners value them too much to run the
risk of losing them.
The foreign classes were very poorly filled, in fact numeri-
cally the show was about the poorest I remember, although
considering the small number of entries the quality was good.
The two Parrot classes were judged by Mr. H. T. Camps, the
remainder of the foreigners by Mr. Frank Finn.
The class for Parrakeets, Lories and Lorikeets
contained ten entries, the first and third prizes going to a very
fine Brown's Parrakeet and a nice but wild pair of Many Colours
respectively, belonging to Mr. W. Edmunds ; the second to a
nice Pennant owned by Mr. Baxbv, and the fourth to a curiously
marked King Parrot in which the face was mostly yellow, owned
by Mr. L. W. Hawkins. Besides the prize winners there was a
very good pair of Brown's as well as another single bird, a nice
Ceram Lory and a fine Red-collared Lorikeet which ought, in my
opinion, to have been a prize-winner.
The class for Other Parrots contained a pair of the
very rare Malayan Blue-rumped Parrakeets ( Psittinus incertus ),
probably the first ever exhibited at a bird show. They were
quite young birds, in the same state of plumage as a pair,
probably of the same importation, now on view in the Parrot
House at the Zoo. They appear to be somewhat closely allied to
the Lovebirds, and when adult the male has a greyish-blue head
while that of his mate is brown. The owner, Mr. L- W. Hawkins,
failed to secure more than a V.H.C. card for his rare exhibit.
The first prize in the class went to a Meyer&amp;apos;s Parrot belonging to
the Rev. G. H. Raynor, who also obtained fourth for his very

much rarer Everett's Parrot. The second prize went to a nice
Black headed Caique sent by Mr. Hawkins, and the fourth to a
very fine Yellow-naped Amazon belonging to Mrs. L. Thorpe.
Mr. F. Howe took the first prize in the class for the
Commoner Waxbii.ls, Grassfinches and Weavers with a

beautiful pair of Goldeu-breasted Waxbills, while Miss Bous-
field's Diamond Finches took second prize, the rest of this class
being made up of St. Helena Waxbills and Ribbon Finches.
In the class for the Rarer Waxbilrs, &amp;c., the first prize
went to Mr. F. Howe, for a very nice Melba Finch, Miss Bous-
field taking second with a fine Red-headed Gotildian and Mr.
Thwaites third with a pair of Pintail Nonpareils. Perhaps the
rarest bird here was a Scaly-crowned Weaver, a rare bird, but
not looking particularly bright.
Amongst the Grosbeaks, True Finches and Buntings
was a nice cock Olive Finch which received first prize for its owner
Miss Wait, a fine Black-lieaded Siskin belonging to Mr. Arriglii
(second) and a pair of Blue Grosbeaks (third), two nice Green
Cardinals and a Black and Yellow Grosbeak were also shown here.
The class for Tanagers contained seven entries, all good
birds. Mr. Townsend's Blue-winged or Gold and Green Tanager
came first; a lovely Black-throated (C. thoracica ) owned by Mr.
Walsh, second ; the same exhibitor's fine Maroon Tanager third,
and Mr. Frostick's very rare Pretre's Tanager, fourth.
Sugar-Birds, Honey-Haters, Zosterops, Buebuls and
Sun-Birds. This class contained ten exhibits, two of which, a
Hardwick's Bulbul and a Rufous-throated Tanager, both in
splendid condition, arrived too late for the judging, while two
pairs of Amethyst-rumped Sunbirds were entered as " not for
competition." The first prize went to a magnificent specimen of
the Amethyst-rumped Sunbird belonging to Mr. A. Kzra, the
same bird that was successfully shown at the Horticultural Hall
Show in October; the second Mr. Townsend's small Black-legged
Sugar-bird (Dacnis nigripes), perhaps the first imported, third to
the same exhibitor's Banana Quit, and fourth to a lovely Purple
Sunbird shown by Mr. Frostick.
The last class for All Species not provided for elsewhere,
generally known as the Any Other Variety Ceass, contained
eight entries. The greatest rarity was Mr. Ezra's Japanese Red-
breast, an extremely rare exhibit ; well deserving the first prize
which it secured. A nice pair of Black-headed Sibias belonging
to Mr. Walsh came second, while the same gentleman took third
with a nice White-eyebrowed Wood-Swallow, the fourth going
to Mr. Wade for a Sliaina.

Although very little of interest has arrived lately we have
been kept very busy amongst the birds, in preparation for the
coming breeding season, when I hope we may beat our record in
the number of birds hatched and reared. The Zoo is anything
but an ideal place for breeding birds. The aviaries are in a
chronic state of overcrowding, the birds can never be kept
properly quiet, and new birds are constantly arriving in the
breeding season, which, for want of other accommodation, often
have to be put in the same aviary with breeding birds, an arrange-
ment that militates strongly against the chances of success.
Our greatest success during the last two years has been
with Pheasants and Waterfowl, and this year we have a better
collection, or rather a collection better established than in either
of those years; but, unfortunately, we have very little rearing
ground. This year our Pheasants will have to be reared in one
of the new goose paddocks as they were last year, but then the
ground had never before had birds on it, whereas now it is
decidedly stale.
At this time of year the Waterfowl have to be carefully
looked over and the pairs arranged so that those kinds which
are likely to disagree may be placed on different ponds. All nest
boxes have to be examined and lined with a fresh nest of turf
and leaves. In the same way the Pheasantries have to be gone
through and provided with faggots of brushwood, behind which
the liens can lay, and the breeding pens selected and arranged
so that no further shifting has to be done until the breeding
season is well over.
The Great Aviary has been overhauled and a special
arrangement of small mesh wire netting and curved zinc, fixed
all round to render it as far as possible lat-proof. Ever since I
have known this aviary it has been more or less over-run with
rats, no attempt having been made to keep them out when it
was re-wired some six or seven years ago. It will be a great
thing for the birds if we can succeed in excluding these pests.
Since my last notes appeared the only arrival, new to the
collection, has been a Yellow-rumped Hangnest (Pseudoleistes

guirahuro), a species inhabiting open country in Southern Brazil
and Paraguay, and nesting in reed-beds. We now have an
example of each of the two species of the genus Pseudoleistes ,--
P. guirahuro and P. virescens; both brownish green birds, the
former with the rump and underparts yellow, the latter with the
rump like the back and only the underparts yellow.
We have added to our stock of ducks eight pairs of the
charming Baikal Teal (NetHum forviosum ), a species that some
few years ago was quite rare in Europe, costing from five to ten
pounds a pair, but which has recently been imported in vast
numbers and sold at a remarkably low price. It is extremely
wild at first, but soon settles down, and next to the Mandarin
and Carolina, is one of the most showy of all the ornamental
waterfowl.
The pair of Kolbe's Vultures went to nest soon after
Christmas, laying a single egg which they took turns to incubate.
They sat splendidly through the recent severe frost, but after the
full period of six weeks had elapsed they were both noticed oft
the nest one day, and an examination revealed nothing but a
few fragments of broken shell. D. S-S.

Sir, -- I wonder if any of your readers could tell me the age to which
a common Robin may be expected to live, assuming freedom from disease
and accident.
I have had (if one can be said to have even a possessory title to a bird
having absolute liberty) a tame cock Robin in my garden and house for 6|
years past, and he seems as well as ever. During this period he has regu-
larly had two nests each spring and usually brought off four healthy young
from each nest.
I will not detail wearisome trivialities as to his absolute tameness, but
two points occur to me as possibly of general interest, (i) The one is that,
considering the numbers of his offspiing, the rate of mortality amongst
Robins must be great, or the district would soon be overstocked, assuming
other Robins are equeally successful in nesting operations ; ( 2 ) all sorts and
conditions of men are intensely interested in a common-place tame bird
such as a Robin, while rare birds, or birds with curious habits are often
passed unnoticed. C. JIarnby .Smith.

It may interest members to know that Mr. Astley's article was con-
sidered at a Council Meeting of the R.S.P.B. on January 26th last with a
view of seeing whether any steps could be taken to put a stop to these
practices. As the question had already been considered by the International
Committee for Bird Protection, it was decided to take no action pending

For a long time there has been such a continuous stream
of books dealing with our native birds that the appetite of the
public for such literature must be well nigh insatiable. This new
work, however, which is being issued in monthly parts, is of its
kind one of the best we have seen. It is written presumably for
the schoolboy whose chief interest is in the nidification of birds,
and is copiously illustrated by photographs taken by the Brothers
Kearton, whose name is a sufficient guarantee for their excellence.
The arrangement of the book is alphabetical and will,
therefore, be much appreciated by the ordinary man in the street
who has no time to learn or fathom the ever-changing whims of
modern classifiers. Under each species we have the information
arranged in headings--such as Description of Birds, Situation of
Nest, Materials of Nest, Eggs, Time of Laying, etc., making a
very concise but yet complete vade-mecum ou the nesting of our
British Birds.

Ornithological troubles are much the same all the world
over, and at their meeting such questions as the destruction of
birds for the purpose of adorning (?) ladies hats and the vexed
questions of nomenclature were well to the fore. Among the
articles we may notice an extremely interesting one on the
'Bush Birds of New Zealand,' from the pen of Mr. McLean,
and that by Messrs. Cleland and Johnston on the Relative dimen-
sions of the Red Blood Cells in different species of birds deals
with a hitherto neglected subject.
BRITISH BIRDS. *
In the three months under review this periodical records a
mass of short notes, which deal to a very large extent with the
occurrence of the rarer species in different counties. Apart from
these there are some notes on the Immigration of Nutcrackers
into England last autumn, the nesting habits of the House
Martin and the recovery of marked birds.
The December number contains an article on the Black-
throated Diver and Grey Lay Goose, illustrated with some beau-
tiful photographs by Mr. O. G. Pike.
A NEW ITALIAN JOURNAL- f
We have received the first numbers of the Rivista Italiana

and edited by our member Professor Ghigi, assisted by Count

Prof. Salvadori. These numbers contain some excellent articles
including a long and comprehensive one on the birds of the
Tuscan Archipelago, as well as some shorter ones on Saxicola

Black-headed Gulls from the Baltic to the Adriatic as shown by
the recapture of ringed birds. Short notes, reviews of current

Mr. Beebe in his paper gives a careful description of the
plumages of three Yucatan Jays, which were living in the Zoo-
logical Park, New York. Most previous writers have considered
that the sexes in this species differed in colour, but, from the
study of his captive specimens, the author shows that the sup-
posed sexual differences are merely due to age, and that when
adult the sexes are alike. The yellow bill and white tips to the
rectrices, supposed to be characteristics of the female, are now
shown to be merely marks of immaturity, and the full adult
plumage is not assumed for at least two years.

Touracous are, I understand, classed with the Cuckoos, on
the ground principally of the likeness of each when in the nest.
I fear I am not scientific, for, in my opinion, the Touracous are
totally unlike the Cuckoos. In their movements and ways there
is no resemblance -- the Cuckoo is principally insectivorous, the
Touracous largely frugivorous.

The Touracous stand alone for grace of movement and
beauty of form of colouring; in fact, there are no other birds
living, as far as I know, that resemble them. The first specimen
I ever had was a young bird, hand-reared from the nest and
almost bare of feathers, with the exception of flight feathers and
tail. She--for she turned out to be a hen Fraser's Touracou--
was absurdly and delightfully tame and in the best of health.
What her age was I could only conjecture, but now on looking
back and comparing the ways of her baby son I should say she
was about six months old.
I remember she filled me with amazement by the way she
bolted large pieces of cuttle fish, she had evidently been denied
grit or lime in any form. Later I was able to secure a mate for
this bird, and the pair were installed in one of my aviary
divisions, about twelve feet square with a larger outside flight
beyond.
I cannot speak too highly of Touracous as aviary birds.
I consider they take the first place, both for beauty, hardiness,
and great intelligence. I may have been fortunate in my par-
ticular pair, but a pair of another variety I possessed were
equally charming. They are easily kept on banana--it must be
ripe, given whole , with a small strip of the skin peeled off--this
will be entirely cleared out and the fruit keeps so much fresher
than when cut up. A bunch of sweet, sweet-water grapes (these
can be very sour) are also much liked, and elderberries, haw-
thorn berries and blackberries are much appreciated, also a
lettuce, placed in a pan of water to keep it fresh. A few meal-
worms given daily are good, but at the best these are indigestible
things. Silkworm eggs allowed to hatch, and the worm given
when about an inch long, is worth a dozen mealworms and really
not much more trouble. My tame hen was very fond of an earth
worm, and it was a curious sight to see her dispose of a really
large, strong worm. Nothing can wriggle like a worm, unless it
is an eel, and yet the Touracou would walk slowly round it and
catch one end and in a few quick gulps it was gone. It was
amazing that this extremely lively creature did not upset her, or
at least cause inconvenience, but she would spring lightly to her
perch, cleanse her beak, and commence to caw or scold in her
usual conversational manner.

When these birds commenced to nest, which they did early
in May, the cock was very fierce, and the bird boy fed them in
fear and trembling every morning. This delightful impudence
was one of their most charming traits and they were a constant
source of amusement to all.
Several young were hatched during the season, but only
one reared to maturity, and this bird lived for two years in my
aviary. He never was quite as tame as his parents, a curious fact,
as I hoped he would be equally tame. Touracous love bathing,
and, if given a shallow pan of tepid water, thoroughly enjoy
themselves. They require plenty of room, as the flight is so
beautiful, the carmine flight feathers only show when the wing
is outspread, and a Touracou in a small division is absolutely
wasted.
The sexes ate not easy to distinguish ; at any rate I should
be puzzled if asked to sex a single bird, but with a pair together
it is easy to distinguish them, as the hen is much more feminine-
looking, and is less fierce and more easily tamed. I think, too,
the bill in the hen is smaller.
For their patience in fully rearing a young bird to maturity
I was awarded a silver medal by the Avicultural Society. A
proud moment and a memorial of these charming birds, which I
much value. A full account of the nesting appears in Ser. 2,
Vol. III. of the Avic. Hag., page 25.
-a- -a- a- A ;
The Bower Birds, of which I have kept several, are also
interesting to keep, but much less easily tamed than the Toura-
cous. In fact, I can say truthfully, I never succeeded in taming
my birds at all. Probably they live entirely in the thickest of
dense undergrowth and rarely appear in the open, unless to make
and decorate their bower.
They are singularly shy birds, highly nervous, and to be
kept with any degree of pleasure, both to the owner and bird,
must have plenty of cover in which to hide and shelter. My
birds were fully adult when imported, I mean bv this fully grown,
but not in the blue-black plumage an old cock assumes. If
imported young, they might be more easily tamed, but mine were
as wild as Hawks and always remained so.

I kept my five birds (.Ptilonorhynchus violaceus ) in a large
aviary, about 15 ft. square, during the winter ; and in the summer
they had an additional outside aviary, in which were growing
tall Rhododendrons, small shrubs and bracken, in fact a small
piece of woodland wired in. They made a beautiful bower
between two Rhododendron bushes, and decorated it with broken
china (blue they preferred), sea shells, and any scraps they could
find. About April, they built a rough nest of twigs, high up in a
tall Rhododendron, and two young were hatched, but alas ! as
soon as they flew a bitterly cold night killed them. The young
were remarkably thinly feathered and the June frost was too
much for them. ( Avic . Mag ., N.S., Vol. I., p. 64.)
That these birds are highly intelligent there is no doubt ;
the grief of the poor mother I shall never forget, and she quite
forgot her fear of humans in the search for her dead babies.
A good insectivorous mixture, with banana or sweet water grape
are all these birds require, but the young were reared entirely on
live insects, mealworms and cockroaches.
I have also kept, for a short time only, three specimens
(either liens or immature cocks) of the beautiful Gardener Bower
Bird (Amblyoruis subalaris). They are hopelessly wild, in spite
of every protection in the shape of thick fir boughs. I cannot
say I felt any desire to keep them, as it is somewhat irritating
after weeks of quiet and care to find no improvement, and only
the same wild terror on your approach. These birds ultimately
met their death from this cause, and died from an injury caused
by hurling themselves against the wire divisions--too highly
nervous to submit to the dignity of captivity, they are best left
to their native wilds and freedom.

And now I come to the most wonderful of all birds--the
Birds of Paradise.
Altogether I have had in my possession twelve different
species of this superb family. Some I have only kept a short
time, others have been years in my possession, but all are in-

of Paradise and the Magnificent Rifle Bird. All these are hardy,
with the exception of the King Birds, and these seem to me to
need something we cannot give them. Personally, I believe they
cannot stand damp and the quick changes of temperature for
which our climate is famous, and for this reason would do much
better in an indoor aviary, only they are very energetic birds and
would quickly get fat if denied the possibility of exercise and
given liberally too fattening food. All my Paradise Birds flew
almost daily out of doors, summer and winter, and I do not think
they mind a low temperature if they can move about freely.
They can all be fed on fruit and insectivorous food. To
the latter I added a little chopped, well-boiled sheep's head,
which they all liked and which I believe is very good for them.
Apples they are particularly fond of; this was curiously proved
when, late in the autumn, a hen Rifle Bird escaped from my
aviary and was in the surrounding woods for many weeks. A
neighbour -- proud of his Ribston Pippins--was much, and very
naturally, annoyed to find every morning several empty "shells"
of apple skin on the ground. So curious was the way the apples
were eaten, leaving quite three parts of the skin intact, that I
felt sure my lost Rifle Bird was the culprit, a fact which was
afterwards proved by her recapture when all edibles, such as
apples and blackberries were over. When re captured she was
thin but perfectly healthy, and is now a member of the lovely
collection at the Zoological Gardens.
As a family, they are undoubtedly very intelligent, an
impoitant point in an aviary bird. They get tame quickly, and
several in my collection would take a grape or mealworm from
my fingers.
Hunstein's Magnificent (. Diphyllodes hnnsteini ) is, or appears
to be, the least intelligent. In the hen plumage these birds are
bright and quick in their movements, but as soon as they assume
adult plumage they become lethargic. A cock will sit absolutely
still for as long as you can stand or watch, with his green breast
plate spread out and his beak pointing upwards. Amongst green
foliage he would be absolutely invisible in this position, and it is
a wonderful instinct which makes him assume it when humans are
present. When these birds fly, the rustle of the wings is an

interesting point I have never heard explained. It is like the
loud rustle of silk and it is difficult to believe the wings make it
alone. I think in the Rifle Bird it is the most noticeable.
The Apoda and Raggia?iia are very fond of mice, and woe
betide one if it enters their aviary. The business-like way in
which the poor captive is held firmly under the foot, each tiny
limb broken by the powerful beak of its captor, shows it is not
a chance appetite, but one that is natural to the bird in its native
land.
Each different species has its own peculiar display, all
somewhat ridiculous and yet very wonderful. Every gorgeous
feather is made the most of for the attraction of the hen bird,
who, I have often noticed, remains singularly unaffected and
receives all the adoration in a phlegmatic and unappreciative
manner. One hen King Bird invariably flew down 10 feed at
the moment, when the cock, a living jewel, was prancing and
dancing for her edification.
How many of these beautiful birds remain alive in Eng-
land I do not know. Mr. Brook's collection at Hoddam Castle
is a marvellous sight, and, undoubtedly, the finest collection of
Paradise Birds in the world. Mine, alas ! are only a memory, as
much illness in my house, which included the birds' keeper,
necessitated my parting with all.

Sir, -- Would it be too much trouble for you to reply either by letter
or in your paper to a few questions about the Itupeyan Pheasant.
I want to know whether they have been ever raised to maturity, and
if so under what conditions. Bast spring my pair laid eight eggs and I
hatched four chicks. Three eggs were placed under a hen and the chicks
only lived about two weeks. They refused to be brooded. The fourth
was placed with some Golden Pheasant chicks and did much better, grew
well and begun to feather. He died at about three-and-a-half weeks.
I do not think anyone in this country has raised any birds.

asked me to answer vour enquiries about rearing Inipeyan Pheasants. I
have found no great difficulty in rearing them to maturity, and at the
present time I have an adult pair, both of which were reared here. I have
had success both when the eggs have been left to the mother bird and when
we have taken them and placed them under a domestic hen. I use cross-
bred "Silkies," bred from Silky hens mated with Game Bantams, for
rearing valuable Pheasants and Waterfowl. After the first week, the hen
should be allowed to leave the coop with the young birds by day and
should have the free range over an enclosure not less than 50 yards square,
where the grass has been allowed to grow long, so as to afford cover and
shelter as well as abundance of natural food. The young birds will do
much better thus than when confined to a coop, for they are great foragers
and take a great deal of exercise. Until the chicks are half-grown they are
shut up in the coop with the hen at night.
A pair of my Impeyans have reared their own young more than once.
They have an enclosure, about thirty yards square, round a large fallen tree
(walnut), which affords a great deal of shelter from wind and rain and great
choice of roosting place. The young perch when three or four weeks old,
and it is a pretty sight to see them settling down for the night, perched
between the parents, both of which will extend the wing over the nearest
chick, for the cock Inipeyan takes his full share of night duty. As might
be expected of a bird coming from very high ground the Inipeyan must
have plenty of shade in hot weather, and this applies specially to the young
chicks.
As to food, my young Impeyans and Tragopans get hard-boiled egg,
chopped lettuce and onion, hemp-seed and moistened barley meal, and
fresh ants&amp;apos; eggs; and I find the best way of giving this is to place it on a
clean board. Nothing must be allowed to get in the least tainted or sour
and no stale food is left about. As the birds get older a little wheat is given
and more barley meal, Canary and other seeds, but I give scarcely any
maize. A heap of sand or fine ashes should be within the young birds
reach for dusting, and a good supply of fine sharp grit and, of course, pure
water. I think the exercise which the chicks get when allowed to run free
with a careful hen is very necessary, for I have known several cases of
failure when attempts have been made to rear Impeyans in coops like the
commoner Pheasants. Also it is very important not to expose the young
birds to a fierce sun. W. H. St. Ouintin.

At a Meeting of the Council held on Feb. 5th, 1912, the
Treasurer submitted the balance sheet for the year 1910--1911,
showing that the deficit of a little over ^30, with which the year
started, had been wiped off, leaving a small balance in hand.
Amongst other matters that came up for discussion was
the question of inviting members of the Society to a friendly and
informal reception, at which tea would be served, in the Zoological
Gardens, after the Council Meeting in the first week in July.
In view of the success that attended last year's meeting of the
same kind, it was decided to repeat the experiment in the coming
summer. Due notice of this, with full particulars, will be pub-
lished in the June number of the Magazine.
The question of members of the Society meeting and
dining socially together at a restaurant in London in the evening,
after the Council Meeting in Feb. 1913, was also discussed and
generally approved, and it was decided to bring up the matter
for final decision at the meeting of the Council in July. The
object of such meetings is to give members of the Society the
opportunity of becoming personally acquainted with each other.

Ceriornis satyr a.
By C. Barnby Smith.
For some years past I have kept Satyra Tragopan Pheasants,
and have had rather special opportunities for seeing the frontal
display of the cock, which I regard as one of the most extra-
ordinary sights I have ever seen in bird life. I gather from
several sources that many people are not so fortunate as myself
in this respect--and indeed I cannot but think if the extraordinary
courting attitude of the bird were more fully known, Tragopans
would be far more commonly kept than they are at present. I
gather from a note to his interesting article on the Display of the
Peacock Pheasant (Avicultural Magazine , June, 1911) that Mr.
Pocock has only seen the lateral display of the Tragopan. Now
the lateral display of a cock Tragopan in good plumage is
interesting ; that is, he presents one side of the head, body, and
tail to the hen, and lowers one wing and raises the other until he
almost looks like the mere skin of a bird stretched flat on a wall.
This pose is constantly assumed during the breeding season (from
February onwards) the cock taking up a position about a yard
distant from the hen and repeatedly assuming a new position if
she moves off.
This lateral display, however, is as nothing to the frontal
display which I usually notice some three or four times each
season. In this case the cock faces the hen (about two or three
yards distant) and commences by crouching down slightly,
ruffling his feathers, and spreading his wings which are slowly

Mr. C. Barney Smith,
flapped on the ground. The head is nodded repeatedly with
increasing speed and the brilliant light blue horns gradually
become inflated and extend forward from the black feathers of
the head whilst the bib (or gular wattle), which is also blue with
pink side stripes, is gradually let down to its full length. Whilst
this is being done the shivering and rustling of the feathers have
increased to an alarming extent, the body of the bird has been
lowered quite near the ground, the wings are extended sometimes
almost to their full width, and the whole business is preceded and
accompanied (particularly in the early stages) by a curious noise
like the "clacking" of two bones together, but how this noise is
made I have never found out, though I should much like to know.
When the bib has been extended to full length fora few moments
the bird gathers himself together, moves forward about a yard,
draws himself up to his full height (and it is surprising how high
he can reach), keeps the bib fully extended in front of the hen
for one moment, and then, within half-a-minute, horns and bib
have entirely vanished and the cock is strolling about pecking
grass as if nothing unusual had happened.
I am afraid anything I can say will quite fail to give an
adequate idea of the extraordinary aspect of the bird whilst the
display is at its height--indeed I think anyone coming suddenly
upon the spectacle would scarcely believe they were looking at a
bird, the spectacle is so demoniacal.
So much for the conduct of the cock ; but, I think, if care-
fully considered, the conduct of the hen is even more curious, or
perhaps I should say more inexplicable, for she seems absolutely
lacking in interest as to the display of the cock.
Whether the cock poses purposely in this grotesque way
in order consciously to make the greatest display of horns and
bib, or whether horns and bib have been developed because the
cocks have everlastingly posed in this way does not seem to
affect the question that one would expect the hen to take some
sort of apparent interest in the display.
There is an interesting chapter dealing with this and
similar questions in Dloyd Morgan's "Animal Behaviour," where
Dr. Groos is quoted as laying stress on " the coyness and re-
luctance of the female," and as making the suggestion that the
</bodyText>

on the Display op the Salyra Tragopan Pheasant. 155
display of the cock bird may cause the female to exercise " an
unconscious choice."
As illustrating the coyness and reluctance of the female
bird, the female Cuckoo is quoted as giving an alluring laugh
that excites her mate to the utmost, when she dashes away
through the tree tops inciting him to follow; also the female
Kingfisher and the Bower Bird are mentioned as examples of
female birds proceeding on similar lines. Granted that this is
so in most cases, is it not strange that when the display of the
cock has been developed to an extraordinary degree the hen
should appear quite unmoved. The matter may be quite plain
to the scientists, but for my part " I have come out by the same
door I went in."
If it be argued that the hen Tragopan is really affected by
the marvellous display of the cock and that she has methods of
showing her feelings unknown to us, it certainly seems very
curious that her emotion or interest under all, or almost all,
other circumstances can be readily seen. If my hen Tragopan
is angry at a Tree Partridge coming to feed too near her ; if she
is excited at roosting time or previous to laying, or if she is
pleased with sunshine or fresh cabbage, or depressed by sleet
and wet snow, it is quite easy to tell her state of mind by obser-
vation, wdiereas during and after the marvellous display of the
cock she will stroll about apparently taking not the slightest
notice, and often turn her back on him and go slowly away,
wandering about just as she often does when he is nowhere near.
The same thing may be doubtless observed to a certain
extent with other kinds of Pheasants, but my point is the curious
fact that where the display of the cock is greatest the apparent
indifference of the hen should be absolute. Of course, it is
alw r ays unsafe to judge from a limited personal experience and
observation, and I for one should be much interested to learn
wdiat other members of the Society who have kept Tragopans
have to say on the point.
I do not for a moment think that any member of the
Society will be found to say that the frontal display of the Satyra
Tragopan is anything else than an extraordinary display of great
interest.

156 On the Blue Thrush and Hangnest.
THE BLUE THRUSH AND HANGNEST.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986573108108108" page_id="32659266"  page_num="156" year="" vol="">
By Helen Atherley.
The Blue Thrush and the Hangnest have been the subject
of many articles in the Avicultural Magazine, but I think they
are both such interesting birds that still more may be written
about them, as, though they both are birds with the very strong
characteristic ways and manners of their kind, they are also
both birds with many individual traits.
I am the happy possessor of both--but I must not say
"possessor," for alas! " Blue" is only with me temporarily, and
his real owner may ask for his return at any moment--this I
earnestly hope may never happen, for Blue is one of the most
interesting birds I have ever had. His temper is not all that it
ought to be, he is a born fighter and no sooner is he out of his
cage than he " goes for me " with all the ardour of his undaunted
spirit. If 011 the floor he attacks my feet, if on a table or sofa he
flies straight at my hands and merciless are his pecks, but his
attacks look worse than they really are, and after a few moments
he will settle down. His favourite perching place is on the
fender, where he spreads his lovely wings, cocks his head on
one side, ruffles up all his feathers and enjoys the warmth of the
fire on his back. He will also fly to the top of the fireguard
(made especially large for the purpose) aud there he will sit,
crouched down, until he is so hot he has perforce to go. I
cannot think it is very good for him, but he so enjoys the warmth
I have never the heart to remove him.
He is terribly jealous of Billy, the Hangnest, and when
they are both out in the room together I have constantly to be
on the watch in case a serious attack on Blue's part should ensue,
but Billy is above fighting and takes but little notice of Blue.
This is quite at variance with what other people have written of
their Hangnests, so that I take it Billy is of a better disposition
than most of his kind, as it certainly is not from want of courage
on his part, he is boldness itself with my dogs, though I must
confess a strange dog coming into the room upsets him greatly.
Billy's great idea of happiness is to get into the pocket of my
jacket, or inside the jacket, where he nestles down under my
arm, and will stay there for hours whilst I am reading.

Diary of Birds seen on the White Nile.
I have made a curious little sleeping box for him, like a
tunnel, an opening at each end, and when the lights are lit he
is very restless and unhappy until this contrivance is put into
his cage, when he at once disappears from view and is seriously
annoyed if I turn him out for a fly about the room.
His is a far more formidable beak than Blue's, and so quick
are his movements that he can draw blood three times from my
finger by rapid " hammerings" before I can stop him, but, barring
this trick of hammering me at times, which he only does when
very angry, he is one of the most delightful of companions.
I made the tunnel sleeping box for him as I found that
whenever he got tired of flying about the room he would take
refuge under the card back of a photograph frame, or under a
book if he was luckly enough to find one overlapping another on
the table, or behind a sofa cushion, anywhere, in fact, where he
could have something over and near his head, hence the sleeping
box and apparently great happiness and satisfaction to Billy.
My happiness would be greater if Billy and Blue would
become friends and companions, but that, I fear, is a Utopian
state which will never be. Billy is curiously attracted by a sight
of himself in the looking-glass ; he throws his head back, draws
himself up to his full height and whistles defiance to his supposed
enemy. Blue, on the other hand, takes no notice of his own re-
flection--this may mean that he possesses more reasoning powers
than Billy--but personally I put it down to want of imagination.
I must not belittle Blue, but the real fact is that Billy is the one
that has my heart, but perhaps that is because he is my very own
and Blue is only a lodger.

Part I.
On January iotli of last year I left Cairo for Khartum,
where I was due on February ist, to join the Soudan Govern-
ment's steamer " Amara," which was starting for a tour on the
White Nile. The steamer was to proceed up the main stream as
far as Kio, and then pass through the Balir el Zeraf, the channel

of which had been sufficiently enlarged by dredgers to admit of
the passage of our small boat, and re-enter the main stream of
the Bahr el Jabel near Shambe, and then continue to Rejaf, the
farthest point to which our boat could go owing to the shallow-
ness of the river. Rejaf is a few miles south of Gondokoro, the
Ismaili&amp;apos;a of Sir Samuel Baker, which is the southernmost station
reached by the monthly mail service. Roughly speaking, Rejaf
is 1070 miles south of Khartum and 540 miles north of the Victoria
Nyanza. I had heard very glowing accounts of the numbers of
species of birds and animals that could be seen on such an
expedition, but on my return I had the satisfaction of feeling
that I had seen more, in the short time I was in the Sudan, than
the most enthusiastic traveller had led me to expect. Before
starting I paid some visits to the excellent collection of animals
in the Giza Zoological Gardens to acquaint myself with the forms
I might meet. Capt. Flower and Mr. Nicoll were exceedingly
kind in pointing out to me the rarer Soudanese species, and on
my return to Cairo Mr. Nicoll helped me to identify many of the
birds I had come across from the descriptions in my diary.
I made the journey from Cairo to Wady Haifa by river,
changing steamers at the first cataract. The birds of this part
of the river have been so often described that I can add nothing
to what has already been written. I was, however, very pleased
to see for the first time such beautiful forms as the Pale Crag
Swallow (Colile obsoleta) at Bedrechen, the White-lumped Chat
( Saxuola leucopygia) at Thebes, the little Green Bee-eater ( Merops
viridis) at Assiut, and the Black and White Kingfisher ( Ceryle
nidi&amp;apos;s ) which is frequently met with on the river.
I arrived at Wady Haifa 011 January 26th and took the train
for Khartum. We were, however, considerably delayed in the
desert by a sand-storm, and consequently did not arrive until
the morning of the 28th. Some of the most noticeable birds in
Khartum are the Yellow Sparrow (Passer lutcus), and, of course,
the ever present Kite ( Milvus migrans ).
On the morning of February 1st I went on board the
" Amara," a small stern-wheeled steamer. We were a small party
of twelve. The steersman and crew were Arabs. The boat was
extremely comfortable, and the engineer, who as usual was a

Scotchman, and had been for several years in the Sudan, had very
much interesting information to give on the country. I11 short,
we made a journey through a wild country in a most pleasant
and even luxurious fashion, and I have no hesitation in recom-
mending such a tour to any who are fond of natural history. I
will now give those parts of my diary which relate to the birds
and animals met with at the various places at which we stopped
or were seen from the deck of the steamer.
Feb. 1st. We started from Khartum at 11.15, and steamed
down the Blue Nile to Omdurman, where the junction of the
Blue and White Niles occurs. Here we turned south. The river
is very wide. The banks are very low and are covered with
an enormous quantity of goats. There were plenty of Wild
Fowl at the water's edge, and among them the Whistling Teal
(. Dendrocygna viduata), the Egyptian Goose ( Chenalopex aegyptin-
cus), the Spoonbill ( Platalea leucorodia ) and the Grey Heron
(Ardea cmetea). A few Egyptian Vultures {Neophronpercnopterus)
were dotted about. There are several low trees about, and among
them the famous Harraz tree, under which General Gordon is
said to have sat, and is now called " Gordon's tree." After lunch,
we passed enormous flocks of geese. It was difficult to believe
that the birds could be present in such quantities. In the middle
of one flock I saw our first crocodile. Later in the afternoon we
passed a flock of Flamingos ( Phoetiicopterus roseus). About four
p.m. we passed the Jebel Auli, the hills from which the building
stone of the neighbourhood comes. There were several Storks
about, the White Stork ( Ciconia alba) and Abdim Bey Stork ( C .
abdimii ), also a large flock of Grey Cranes (Gruscommunis). The
natives are almost entirely Arabs on this part of the river.
They have a few cattle, those I saw were mostly humped.
Feb. 2nd. Early this morning I saw several Lady William
Cecil's Crowned Cranes ( Balearica pavonina ceciliae ) as well as
some large flocks of common ones. Some Lesser Black-backed
Gulls (Lat usfuscus) were flying over the river. It is interesting
to note that we are 2 000 miles from the mouths of the Nile, so
they have followed the river some considerable distance inland.
At nine a.m. we reached El Dueim, a large town inhabited by
Danagla Arabs and a few negroes. From here a caravan route

Mr. Richard Staples-Browne,
goes to Kordofan, and liere are brought large quantities of gum
for shipment. After leaving the town one finds that the banks
of the river are more wooded. The trees are mostly Acacias.
There are some fields of doorah. On the banks I saw several
Demoiselle Cranes ( Grus virgo). Buff-backed Herons ( &amp;apos; Ardea bu-
bulcus ) and some Cormorants (. Phalacrocorax car bo). Several
crocodiles were seen basking at the river's edge. At five p.m.
we stopped for wood at a small village called Edbekki. It con-
sisted of a few&amp;apos; conical straw 7 huts inhabited by a mixed population
of arabs and negroes. Some of our party went shooting and
brought back some Blue-wattled Guinea Fowls ( Numida ptilo-
ihyncha) and Spur-w&amp;apos;inged Plovers {Hoplopterous spinos 7 is), both of
which subsequently proved excellent on the table. A specimen
of the Equatorial Palm Dove ( Turtur senegalensis aequatorialis ,
was also shot. I found several nests of the Ethiopian Weaver
Bird ( Quelea quelea aethiopica) on the bushes overhanging the
river. There were several monkeys about, probably the Grivet
Monkey (Cei copithecus aethiops ). After leaving the wood-station
we passed several backwaters and low islands covered with reeds,
on one of which I saw our first Papyrus. During dinner this
evening the sky was lighted up by an enormous bush fire.
Feb. 3rd. We arrived at Kosti shortly after midnight and
tied up till dawn, so as to pass through the new White Nile
Bridge (Rabalc), which had to be opened for us, at seven a.111.
The bridge carries the new railway which is being constructed
to Kordofan. At ten a.111. we stopped at a wooding station and I
went along the river bank through the coarse grass. I saw
several Abdim Bey's Storks and some Paradise Whydali Birds
(Vidua parcidisea) which were in beautiful plumage. We are
now well in the country of the Shilluks, the northermost negro
tribe on the river. I met two of their spearmen carrying a fine
Python (P. sebae ) which they had just killed in the rushes. I
measured the snake and found it over nine feet in len glh. A
great quantity of the empty shells of a large snail (? Ampullaria)
were strewn along at the water's edge. I11 the afternoon we con-
tinued our journey and passed through a coarse grass country and
a little forest land. We saw several hippopotami in the river.
Generally only the head was visible above water, I saw some

buffalo through glasses at some distance inland. To-day I saw
for the first time some Sacred Ibis ( Ibis aethicpica). This is
the bird which is so generally associated with Egypt, but is
apparently never seen there in spite of the assertion of nearly
every Dragoman to the contrary. Several Bee-eaters were seen
flying over the river, probably Merops nubictis , apiaster , persicns,
snperciliosus and viridis.
Feb. 4th. At a wood-station early this morning some of
our party came across a herd of fifteen Korin Gazelle ( Gazella
rufifrons ), two of which they shot. At 11.30 we arrived at the
town of Renk, inhabited chiefly by Shilluks. I saw a large
number of Waxbills of various species in the bushes near the
town. In the afternoon we passed through some thick forest,
consisting almost entirely of Acacias, in which I saw a large
number of the Blue-Wattled Guinea Fowl.
Feb. 5th. I again saw large numbers of Waxbills at the
wood-station where we stopped this morning, and among them
recognised the Cordon Bleu ( Estiilda phoenicotis). Early in the
afternoon I was lucky in seeing three wild Ostriches ( Struthio
camelus ) in a lightly wooded grass country. At three p.111., we
arrived at Melut, a Government telegraph station, with a mixed
population of Soudanese and Shilluks. In the late afternoon I
saw several Black-winged Stilts ( Himantopus Candidas&amp;apos;) and some

Feb. 6th. We arrived at Kodok, formerly known as
Fashoda, at seven a.m. One passes through a mosquito-infested
swamp by means of an embankment to reach the town. There
is a small garrison stationed here. The " Mek," or King of the
Shilluks also resides here. We saw several of their canoes on the
river, both dug-outs and lighter craft made of ambasli reeds tied
together. Major Marchand's garden is still kept up. A short
distance south of Kodok I saw some Pelicans ( Pelica?ius onocro-
tahis). I11 the afternoon we called at the station of the Austrian
Roman Catholic Mission at Lul. At five p.111. I had the pleasure
of seeing through my glasses some Giraffes, apparently three
adults and one young one. As far as I could judge, they were a
little over a mile from the river and were standing in a low scrub.
About sunset we landed at a small Shilluk village, the inhabitants

of which, apart from the annual visit of the inspector, do not
come into contact with white people. The Sheikh received us
with ceremony and presented a sheep to us. Afterwards he
ordered the drums and horns to be brought, to the accompani-
ment of which his men performed the most fearsome and awe-
inspiring war dance it has ever been my privilege to behold.
The performance concluded with a charge, the men halting with
their spear-points a few inches from our noses.
Feb: 7th. This morning we wooded at Kio, and entered
the Bahr el Zeiaf about eleven a.m. The channel of this river
is narrow and is often overgrown with " sudd," which consists
of papyrus and other reeds. We frequently encountered floating
islands of sudd. There is much high coarse grass in the sur-
rounding country, in which one sees a large number of game
animals, among which I recognised Buffalo, Sable and Roan
Antelope, Hartebeest and Kob. Waterbuck are present in vast
numbers. I calculated we must have passed at least 7C0 between
three and seven p.m. Gazelles are also fairly numerous. I again
saw some Ostriches, also some Nubian Bustards {Otis nuba) and
some Chukar Partridges (Caccabis chukar ). The beautiful White-
headed Vociferous Eagle (Haliaetus vocifer) is common, and I saw
several nests of this species in the trees near the river banks.
Bee-eaters were also present in large numbers. Eater in the
afternoon I saw large flocks of the Hagedash Ibis (Ibis hagedash).
These grotesque-looking birds performed several evolutions in
the air and somewhat resembled a flock of rooks. Insects, in-
cluding many stinging forms, are unpleasantly numerous. At
about eight p.m. we stuck fast, the sudd having broken one of
the blades of our wheel, and as soon as the sun set there was a raw
damp feeling together with a smell of decaying water weed. The
chilliness is accentuated by the extreme heat during the day.
Feb. 8th. Our wheel was mended at one a.m. and we
proceeded at six. The river becomes very tortuous here. Trees
are few. During the morning we saw a large herd of Elephant
on the bank of a backwater. The natives here are of the Nuer
tribe. We passed some hunting parties of them. I11 the after-
noon the view became extremely dull and monotonous. The
country is flat, broken only by several large ant-hills. Animal life

was scarce. At sunset, innumerable frogs commenced croaking.
Later, a large number of fire-flies appeared, and as soon as the
lights were turned on we were boarded by swarms of mosquitoes.
Feb. 9th. At three a.111. we arrived at the dredgers, which
have been working at the sudd for some time past. It would
probably repay a zoologist to live on board the dredger to
examine the numerous species which are brought up. The
country now gets more wooded and we passed some Dorn palms.
During the morning I saw some of the brilliantly-coloured
Saddle - billed Storks ( Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). Some
Whistling Teal were shot. I also saw some specimens of
RiippeH's Spur-winged Geese ( Pledropletus rueppelli&amp;apos;), also a
species of Dai ter ( Plotns congensis). This latter bird swims
with the body entirely submerged. Navigation above the
dredgers is difficult as our wheel frequently gets clogged with
sudd. There are also many shallows in the river. Hippotami
were numerous, and owing to the narrowness and shallowness
of the channel it was difficult for them to get out of our way;
indeed we experienced a very violent blow on one occasion
during the efforts of one to pass under our boat. At four o'clock
I saw the most interesting birds which I came across during the
whole journey. Two Shoe-billed Stoiks ( Balceniceps rex ) were
in the rushes at the side of the liver. Our boat passed quite
close to one of them, but it remained absolutely motionless and
paid not the slightest attention to our presence. Our engineer
told me they are rare in this neighbourhood, but are more often
met with in the Balir el Ghazal district. I felt extremely fortunate
in seeing this extraordinary species. To-night we pass through
the new cutting from the Balir el Zeraf into the Balir el Jebel,
which follows the course of that made by Sir Samuel Baker.
To-morrow we shall reach Shambe 011 the main stream, 843
miles from Khartum.

By Mrs. E. Warren Vernon.
I have a pair of Military Starlings (Trapealis de philippi )
and it may be of some interest to members to have a short
account of them. Mr. Philip Gorse, in his article in this maga-
zine under the title of " Notes on some birds in the Andes in
the neighbourhood of Auncagua," says: "I do not know why
these birds are not freely imported, as they have everything in
their favour as aviary birds." I can fully endorse this, they are
most gentle towards the other inmates of my conservatory-aviary,
and these consist of Waxbills, Nightingales, Long-tailed Tits,
etc., so there is a variety for them to quarrel with if so inclined ;
and, considering their long punishing bills and heavy build, it
is the more remarkable, as I think Starlings usually are most
aggressive.
Both these birds have lovely red breasts, the cock bird
especially so. They both sing a really pretty song and very
loud, and the scarlet breast adds to the attractiveness of them as
inmates of the aviary. They eat a good deal of seed, Parrot
mixture, besides soft food and insects, and I found them eating a
raw beetroot that was put in for some Agouti.
There are some hot-water pipes under the floor, which
let the heat up through an ornamental iron opening, and in
the cold weather the two birds used to squat over this place, so I
put a box with open side and no floor to it, and they used to go
and sit inside; it must have been like a Turkish bath, but they
seemed to love it.
I have two Agouti, and they run with the birds very
happily ; the Starlings, however, are quite masters, and before the
young Agouti was born they used to lie in front of the Augoutis
bed and would not allow the Agouti to enter. Now, however,
there are two babies, and the parents do not mind the Starlings
any more. The cock bird used to drive the Agouti away from
the food for pure mischief, and it used to give me a good deal
of amusement watching them.
I should be glad to know if other members have kept
these amusing birds, and if they have ever been known to breed
in captivity.

By Pelham T. L. Dodsworth, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.,
Member of the Bombay Natural History Society.
(Concluded from page 135E
When inspecting the nests of Green Pigeons, I have often
wondered whether the twigs composing them have been picked
off the ground or broken off from the branches. I am inclined to
think that it is the latter, as the ends of some of the twigs, which
I have minutely examined, showed unmistakable signs of having
been wrenched off. I have seen Koklas carrying sticks in their
mouths, but how they get them is another question. The point
is an interesting one, and well worthy of further observation.
But to return to the subject of my captive birds.
Spring had now come, and the Koklas, which were still
sharing their cage with the Doves, began to get unusually active.
The cock kept chasing the hen from perch to perch, and con-
stantly uttered his melodious notes, which were now complete.
Major Magrath likens these to the syllables, " Ko-Kla-KOi, Si, Si,
61, oiiyi.i, illto-Kla," but Blyth's description of them is, perhaps,
the best. He says " the notes bear some resemblance to the
human voice in singing, and are highly musical in tone, being
considerably prolonged and modulated, but always terminating
abruptly, and every time the stave is repeated exactly as before,
so that it soon becomes wearisome to an European ear." I may
add that both male and female utter the same notes and, while
singing, the tail is moved gently up and down, as if keeping time.
Remembering the old adage that ''two is company," and
hoping that under such a condition the Koklas might be induced
to form a matrimonial alliance, they were separated from the
Doves and put into another cage to the mutual advantage of both
couples, and shortly afterwards we witnessed the courtship of the
male bird. He would utter his notes, puff out his throat, expand
his tail feathers, spread out his wings, and hop from perch to perch
with bowed head, uttering a low "coo" the whole time. The lien

did not seem to relish these attentions, for she would drop down
on to the floor of the cage, as if to avoid her mate, who imme-
diately followed her, and with a low "coo-coo" called her into a
corner of the cage. Both birds would then pretend to pick up
something from the ground, and after a short time fly back to
their perches. This was constantly repeated during the day, and
the proceeding on the part of the male struck me as being very
similar to that of a cock in the poultry yard calling his liens
round him when a dainty morsel has been found. During the
breeding season here, I have often heard the male Kokla in the
wild state utter the low " coo-coo" note after his usual song, but
have never up to this had the good fortune actually to witness
the courtship.
Just when matters were reaching a most interesting stage
with my birds, the hen suddenly sickened and died, and it is
almost impossible to describe in words the intense grief which
was displayed by her mate. For a long time he walked round
and round her body, singing and calling her, and would not
allow any one to touch her. When the dead bird was eventually
removed and placed on the ground outside the cage, he still kept
walking round and round, singing and calling her. Bor the
whole of that day, and for several daj^s after the death of the hen,
he was perpetually whistling at short intervals and going through
the form of courtship already described, and there seemed no
doubt whatever that he was greatly distressed at the domestic
calamity that had befallen him.
Three months have now passed since the death of the hen,
and the cock seems to be somewhat reconciled to his loneliness.
The courtship proceedings are still occasionally indulged in, but
as there is now no fair one to whom he can pay his attentions,
he eliminates the final act of dropping in the corner of his cage,
and calling to his mate. He seems at times to get tired of his
plantain diet, and for two or three days at a time will eat nothing
else but grain--a habit no doubt acquired from his quondam
companions, the Doves: he also occasionally eats large quantities
of mud, apparently as an aid to digestion. The sound of a
bugle or the striking of a clock sets him off singing at once.
His powers of discernment appear to be highly developed. I

have three dogs in the house, and these appear to be on the
most friendly terms with him : he does not mind their presence
in the least, and sometimes when he gets a chance even pecks
at their noses, when the animals come too close to his cage.
But when a stray dog happens to come close to him the bird
recognises the difference at once, and begins fluttering and dash-
ing himself against the bars of his cage. The house dogs appear
to have associated the noise made by the bird's fluttering with
the presence of a strange dog, and immediately rush out and
soon see the intruder off the premises.
Before concluding these notes, I will add a few remarks
about the plumage of this species in captivity. The curious
thing here is that the colouration assumed by such birds differs
iu many respects from that of the wild ones. Indeed the differ-
ences are so great that Blytli was actually led to describe a caged
specimen as a new species under the name Vinago cantillans.

bird is just about a year old, and has not yet moulted. When it
does moult, I daresay further differences in its plumage will be
apparent.
Blyth's account of the caged specimen which had moulted ,
and which he described as Vinago cantillans is interesting, and
as it is buried in the Journals of the Asiatic Society of Bengal
(Vol. xii., pp. 166-167), which are not easy of access, I reproduce
it below practically in extenso : --
"Predominant hue a delicate pearl-grey, conspicuously tinged with
ruddy on the crown and breast: fore-part of the wings maroon-red, which
also deeply tinges the scapularies and interscapularies : belly faintly tinged
with yellowish-green, and a trace of dingy green margining the rump
plumage and the smallest tertiaries, also prevailing on the coverts of the
secondaries, the greater series of which are slightly bordered with whitish-
yellow : primaries and secondaries dusky, together with the extremities of
the outer tail feathers : vent white, the feathers of its sides having dark
ashy centres ; and lower tail-coverts whitish-buff, being more or less ashy at
base. Irides as usual in this genus, or having a crimson ring encircling a
violet one. bill and bare skin around the eye glaucous-blue; and legs and
toes reddish carneous. This remarkable species is essentially a Vinago,
though differing considerably from the typical species in the form of its bill
and feet; insomuch that it might, with propriety, be elevated to the rank
of a particular subgenus: the former is comparatively slender and elon-
gated, having the basal three-fifths membranous and tumid, and the
corneous extremity feeble ; and the toes also are slender, and not broadened
underneath. The specimen described was purchased alive, and was said to
have been brought from Agra; but some shikarees to whom I shewed it
decidedly recognised the species, at once remarking on the peculiarity of
its note, and said that it is procurable in the Soonderbuns. Its coo is ex-
tremelv remarkable . This bird was sold to me as the Kokla Pigeon
of the Upper Provinces, great numbers of which are kept in cages by the
natives, for the sake of their music ; but enquiry has led me to ascertain
that V. sphenura is the true Kokla of the Upper Provinces, whereas in
Bengal this term is applied to V. bicincta , Jerdon, both of these species
differing from the common Hurrial (V. militaris ) by having coral-red legs
instead of gamboge yellow ones, which is generally mentioned as the dis-
tinctive feature of th ft Kokla ; the V. bicincta , however, has a less musical,
or at least less varied, note than the Hurrial. The coo of the latter, if such
it can be called, consists of a melodious deep-toned whistling note, varied
by a guttural sound ; and those who are unacquainted with it, would be apt
to mistake it for the note of a true singing bird: that of V. bicincta is
equally melodious, but less prolonged as well as less varied. I know of only
the two last-named species of this genus in the vicinity of Calcutta."

Although the weather during the past month has been
anything but ideal, the feeling of Spring has had a marked effect
upon the birds. A pair of Earl's Weka Rails have gone so far as
to hatch one sturdy black chick from a clutch of three eggs ; a
pair of Andaman Teal have made a nest in one of the boxes fixed
on a post some four or five feet above the ground ; Egyptian
Geese are sitting, while both Elliot's and Peacock Pheasants
have commenced to lay. Birds, like plants, seem to be some
weeks ahead of their time this spring.
One of the most interesting sights which can be seen
almost any day now is the wonderful display of the male Peacock
Pheasants about which Mr. Pocock gave us such an excellent
paper last year. He begins by scratching the ground for some
tit-bit, having found which, he holds it in his bill and with a
series of clucking sounds calls the hen. As she approaches he
gradually lowers his breast and expands the tail and wings.
When the lien is within a foot or so, with a forward jerk of the
head he throws the grain of seed or whatever he is holding,
towards her, and expands the tail and wings to the utmost
extent, while the head is pressed down sideways against the
wing. He looks like nothing so much as a fan set with jewels.
Amongst the arrivals for the past month are two rare
Indian birds, kindly presented by Mr. Alfred Ezra, namely, a
Racket-tailed Drongo and a White-capped Robin, the latter of
which is only the second example the Society has possessed.
Another noteworthy addition is a splendid adult example

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE BREEDING OF NIGHTINGALES.
[We have much pleasure in publishing the following most interesting letter
on the breeding of Nightingales from Mr. Jeffrey, a well-known
breeder and exhibitor of British birds, and we hope that later on Mr.
Jeffery will give us a further and more detailed account of his methods-
and successes.--E d.]
Sir,--T he breeding of Nightingales is a very old pastime of mine, as
j&amp;apos;ou will see by the paper I send you.
Twelve months ago I went to Leicester to design an aviary for my
friend Mr. Sills of that town, in which he placed a pair of Nightingales.
They went to nest and successfully reared young, which he hopes to breed
from this season. I wrote an article to Cage Birds last year offering to any-
one the privilege of paying Mr. Sills a visit to see the young birds in the
nest and if they so wished to photograph them, but I believe no one took
advantage of his offer, and I was rather disappointed, as this was the first
gentleman I could persuade to try the breeding of these birds in confine-
ment. I had hoped to interest a good many people in the hobby of breeding
soft-bills, and by dint of perseverance I think I have got the thin edge of
the wedge in now, as I have been lecturing to several Ornithological
Societies and several fanciers are trying the experiment this year. I am-
hoping this year to try a cross between a tame cock Robin and a Nightin-
gale. Nightingales are most adaptable birds for cage and aviary and go to-
nest very readily. I have bred Robins, Skylarks, Thrushes and Nightingales-
in my aviaries at Kidderminster. Last summer a pair of my Nightingales-
attempted to go to nest in a workshop, it would have been a great curiosit}&amp;apos;.
I have never had my birds or aviaries photographed, and could only give
sketches and descriptions of same, but this summer all being well I shall
certainly do so. Iam very pleased that more interest is being taken in
British biids, especially soft-bills. 1 have made a life study of British birds,,
and sent four pairs of Nightingales to the Crystal Palace Show as long ago-

From the Birmingham Weekly Post, 22nd July, 1899.
"The breeding in confinement of that king of all song birds, the
Nightingale is certainly unique in the annals of ornithology. It is, how-
ever, a hobby which Mr. Jeffrey, of Kidderminster, has followed most suc-
cessfully.
The aviaries, I am credibly informed, are very extensive and in the
open-air, running the whole length of the garden and built with a lean-to
roof against a back wall made of galvanized iron, similar to that which is
used for roofing purposes and measures about 60 feet long, 8 feet high at
the back and 7 feet wide, and is divided into sections, each compartment
being separated by a wood and wire netting partition with doors leading
from one to the other, and the whole structure covered with half-inch mesh
wire netting. A walk, formed with bordering tiles, runs through the
aviaries from end to end with a narrow border on each side, where plants
and shrubs grow and blossom freely, and the birds take advantage of the
covert provided by the latter, and make their nests and rear their young at
the foot of the shrubs, which abound. To complete the excellent arrange-
ment of these ideal aviaries, where everything is carried out with care and
forethought and adapted to resemble in miniature as far as possible the
natural haunts of the birds, to which undoubtedly much of the success is
due; a small stream of water a few inches wide and two inches deep is made
to run constantly through the whole length of the structure."
REVIEWS.
MIGRATION. *
The Migration of Birds is a subject in which almost every-
one, ornithologist or not, takes an interest, but about which much
still remains to be discovered. There should, therefore, un-
doubtedly be a good demand for a popular book dealing with
the main theoiies as to the method in which many species of
birds make their biennial journey from Continent to Continent.
Unfortunately Mr. Coward's book will not supply that want, the
author, who is a well-known local Cheshire ornithologist, and
who has already published an extremely valuable book on the
fauna of that county, has evidently had but little practical ex-
perience of migration, and this book is merely a compilation

from some of the literature on the subject mingled with some
very strong opinions of the writer.
Probably no one has had better opportunities of studying
migration than the late Herr Gatke, who, living for 25 years or
more on an ideal place of observation Heligoland, spent almost
the whole of that time in observing and making notes. His
great book, published in 1893, contained some new and startling
facts, which were somewhat sceptically received by many orni-
thologists. Those, however, who have studied the subject in the
field cannot but come to the conclusion that Gatke's theories,
though possibly exaggerated, are in the main true. Not so, how-
ever, with our author who, from his arm-chair writes (p. 34) : --
" The absurdity of Gatke's arguments are proved by a study of
his book." Further on, however, in his own book, Mr. Coward
allows the truth of many of Gatke's arguments by granting that
many species make long journeys without a break and also that
the journey is undertaken at a great height.
Throughout the book lack of practical knowledge is
shown ; for instance, p. 36, where reference is made to Swallows
migrating along the shore in a definite direction and keeping
to a narrow line. Had Mr. Coward been out frequently he
would have noted that, with a change of wind, these birds
would at once have changed their direction, and that, therefore,
this phenomenon, often observed in autumn, is in no sense a
true migration. Apart from bad reasoning, the book contains
many misstatements. On p. 63 Mr. Coward denies the exist-
ence of an E. to W. flight, making out that such a flight is
merely a leeward drift on a N.E.-S.W. flight. Birds have been
observed leaving the shores of the Continent flying due W. and
arriving on our east coast from the E-, and, if we mistake not, they
were roughly timed by Mr. Cordeaux in communication with a
Continental observer, but if this were not proof we have further
definite evidence from ringed birds which have been marked
in E. Germany and recovered in the West, but this paper written
by Dr, Thienemann has evidently not reached the author as it
is omitted in the curious list of papers called a 'Bibliography'
which is found at the end of the book. Another bad mis-
statement is found on p. 68, where the large race of Wheatear

is said to winter in E. Africa, from which locality it has not yet
we believe been recorded. Mr. Coward has some suggestive
remarks to make concerning the air-cnrrents at different altitudes
and the possible drift of birds from Norway to France via the
West of Ireland, but at present such notes are purely speculative.
We feel that the author has attempted a task beyond his
powers, and that, as the book is cheap, too high a standard
should not be expected, yet inaccuracy is dear at any price.

By J. Lewis Bonhote.
At this time of the year the thoughts of all aviculturists are
concentrated on "spring-cleaning" and the re-arrangement of
their stock into their summer quarters, whether for breeding or
otherwise. On looking through the back numbers of our Maga-
zine one is struck by the fact that, amongst all our members, a
comparatively very small proportion can in any way be termed
successful breeders; of course the difficulties to be contended
with are great, the majority of the birds kept are inhabitants of
foreign and more genial climes, then natural food, and especially
that with which the young should be nourished is unattainable
in this country, and from lack of aviary room they cannot be
given the quiet and freedom from molestation necessary to the
successful rearing of their young. In spite of all these draw-
backs, however, the list of successful breeders might be much
greater than it really is, and I propose to give a few hints which
may, I hope, assist in producing a greater measure of success.
Two factors are indispensable to successful breeding (i) Condition,
(ii) Stimuli, which, in other words, implies environment and
attention to minute details.
Firstly, Condition. This is, of course, a sine qua non, and
unless it be in suitable 'condition' no bird can breed or should
even be mated up for breeding. A secondary point to be borne
in mind about ' condition ' is the time of year at which a bird must
be brought into breeding trim. In this respect many birds in
confinement are late--not till June or July do they respond to

tlie influences (often the reverse of genial) of our Spring, and by-
July the year has turned, the moult commences and the oppor-
tunity of nesting for that y^ear is lost. Of course we know that
many broods are successfully reared in the latter part of the
summer, but we are endeavouring to show that the measure of
success might have been much greater had the stock come into
' condition ' sooner. Those species that never breed owing to this
cause largely outnumber those that do. Our first efforts, there-
fore, should be to get our stock into breeding condition as soon
as possible, let us say by the end of April, and for this purpose at
least two or three months preparation is necessary.
First of all, the sexes should be kept apart, where they can
neither see nor hear each other. They should be kept in an
aviary with inside and outside flight, in which they should be
allowed to fly on fine and warm days; the inner aviary should,,
however, always be warm (not hot) especially at nights. They
should not be allowed in the outer flight till towards mid-day,
and shut up again before sunset. Actual cold, provided the
weather be fine, will do them no harm for their few hours flight,
but on raw days, especially if accompanied by rain and wind,
they should only be allowed out for a very short time or not at
all. The next important consideration is food: this should be
abundant and nourishing, but of not too fatty a nature, as a fat bird
will never breed ; fresh green food, bath, grit, and other hygienic
adjuncts should be carefully attended to, and the result of such a.
treatment, if conscientiously followed, will not fail to bring the
birds into 'condition.' It is of course much easier to write about
these matters than to carry them out successfully, the main
stumbling block being the question of food, and as this article is
not on any particular species it is impracticable to give any special
menu.
The main facts to be aimed at, however, are fresh air,
exercise, moderate warmth, good, but not fattening, food. I need
hardly state here the signs of a bird being in good condition.
Glossiness of plumage, brightness of eye, alertness, quarrelsome-
ness, restlessness, song, or frequent repetition of a call note, full
development of any ornamental plumage, etc. ; these are signs
of 'condition,' and until a bird shows them no attempt should be
made to lning the sexes together.

Practical Bird-Keeping.
The mistake is often made of pairing the birds too soon, a
procedure which defeats its own object. The male is usually
ready before the female, and if they be paired as soon as the male
is in 'condition' he exhausts himself in trying to persuade his
mate to take on duties for which she has no inclination, and she,
worried with his attentions, loses 'condition' rather than gains it.
We will now suppose that by the beginning of April both
sexes are ready to breed, or nearly so, we still need not hurry,
the longer the sexes are kept apart the more easily they will pair,
and the middle of April is quite early enough to bring them
together.
We must now turn to the important question of pairing
and the second of our great factors ' stimuli.&amp;apos;
If possible the hens should have been kept in the aviary
in which they are to breed, and if, as often happens, it is neces-
sary to have two or more species breeding in the same aviary, the
hens should have been kept together during the early months of
the year. If, however, it has not been practicable to keep the
hens in their breeding quarters during the few months imme-
diately preceding the nesting season they should have been
moved into their nesting quarters at least a fortnight previous
to the introduction of the males.
The number of hens kept should always be greater than
the number of males, as they are more difficult to get into ' con-
dition,' and since they play the chief part in the choosing of their
mates there is more chance of any particular cock finding his
' affinity ' if there are several hens on the look out for an ' eligible
bachelor.' Animals and birds will generally mate up, even if
they are not particularly attached to each other, if there be only
one pair, but success is much more probable if they are allowed
to choose their own mates. These small details may seem rather
trivial, but it must be remembered that these notes are meant to
apply chiefly to those species which seldom breed in confine-
ment ; with those that nest freely these methods are unnecessary,
though, even in the case of free breeders, these hints would not
be found useless.
We will now presume that our birds are in ' condition ' and
the hens in their breeding aviary, the next move is to introduce

<bodyText confidence="0.997896794871795" page_id="32659289"  page_num="177" year="" vol="">
the males. One or two moderate-sized cages should previously
have been placed in the aviary, and, when the hens have got
accustomed to these cages, the males should be put in, each one
in a separate cage. All the males that are intended to breed in
the aviary should be paired at the same time, and it will conduce
to future peace if these males have already been living together.
The best time to cage up the males is after dark or just before
dusk. Owing to the birds taking fright and knocking themselves
about it is often impossible to move them after dark, and it
should then be done just before they go to roost ; the main idea,
however, is that they should remain quiet when first moved and
wake up in their new quarters, by this means they will be far less
disturbed by their change and no violent fighting is likely to take
place. On the evening of the second or third day the doors
should be opened and the birds allowed to find their way into
the aviary in the morning.
If these instructions have been followed out there is not
likely to be any serious trouble, but the aviary should be watched
for the next day or two. The next step will be to remove the
surplus hens, and this can be done as soon as it is seen which
pairs have mated. This may take place almost immediately, or
not for some days, but if the birds are really in condition it will
not be long, and once that has been successfully accomplished
the first step is completed.
Our attention must now be concentrated on the second
great factor, that of stimuli , for a bird in breeding condition and
mated will not necessarily breed, or at the most will only drop
her eggs if the surroundings are not to her liking, and, in the
case of some species, they will not even mate until they see the
materials and locality for their future home at hand.
The first important point to consider under the head of
' stimuli' is the other inhabitants of the aviary. The ideal con-
ditions is of course to give each pair an aviary to themselves,
but when space does not admit of this arrangement a golden rule
to remember is to place in the same aviary species which are
least nearly related. During the nesting season--except in the
case of those species which breed in colonies--a bird is always
most pugnacious towards its own kind, or those of other nearly
related species.

The size of the aviary is not so important an item as many
seem to think ; and, personally, I believe that more success is
likely to be attained by keeping a pair to itself in a large cage
than in an aviary with other birds; a fact I have proved to my
own satisfaction over and over again, but if birds are to breed in
a cage they must of course be in tip-top condition. The reason
for this is fairly obvious : in an aviary they have so many outlets
for their energy in flying about, fighting and searching for a
suitable site, that much of the vigour that should be expended
in breeding becomes dissipated in other directions, besides which
the smaller (within limits) the cage or aviary the easier it be-
comes to give each bird individual attention and keep up his
condition.
The next important point is quiet or seclusion. Many
species will not nest unless they feel secure from their enemies,
and, consequently, before the nesting season the breeding quarters
should be thoroughly overhauled, and all mice, rats and especially
cats, should be kept well away. There is nothing more disturb-
ing to birds than the nightly patroling of their premises by cats,
and this of itself is quite sufficient to prevent many species from
attempting to nest.
We must now consider the furnishing of the aviary, and
as a preliminary should read up as much as possible of the birds&amp;apos;
habits when wild and try to imitate them fairly closely. In most
cases of course an exact replica is impossible, and, therefore,
more success is likely to be obtained by studying the essentials
rather than the details. For instance, with species that nest high
up in trees the essential point is that the nest is placed well away
from the ground, and a nest-box attached to the roof of the aviary
is more likely to be appreciated than one lower down or on a
tree. A Kingfisher that breeds in a hole in a bank overhanging
water would take equally readily to a box on the wall provided it
went in far enough from the entrance--the water would not be
essential. Each nesting-place should be arranged so that it may
be easily defended, and there should be very few perches near it,
only just sufficient in fact for the needs of the nesting pair, for if
other birds are able to settle near the nest it will probably be
deserted or the young destroyed. For those species which nest

in thickets, several small thickets suspended if possible from the
roof will be found more acceptable than one large one. I11 any
case, far more nesting-sites should be provided than the number
of pairs, and, further, the birds should be carefully watched so
that if they appear to have decided on a spot unsuitable or un-
provided with the necessary accommodation a nesting-site may
then be fixed up in that spot. With those species that build open
nests in bushes, several flat platforms of natural twigs may be
fastened here and there, which may be used as a foundation..
Nesting material of all kinds should be abundantly supplied, as
well as plenty of that most artificial of substances cotton wool,
for many species are very fond of this as it forms such excellent
binding material and is at the same time soft and warm.
I cannot, in this very general article, enter on the question
of food. The staple diet should of course be that which they
have been having in order to bring them into * condition,' but
the nesting of backward or shy breeders may sometimes be
brought about by giving them, in addition to this, the extra food
which they will eventually require to rear the young; this need
not of course be continued after they have commenced incuba-
tion, but in some cases it does undoubtedly induce them to make
a start.
This, then, completes the rough summary of essentials
mostly consisting of small details which, undoubtedly, go a long
way towards bringing about success.
There is, however, one more point which may be men-
tioned, and that is the conduct of the avicul turist himself towards
his charges. In breeding rare species, our object as aviculturists
should be to add something to the general knowledge of the
inner life history and habits of our pets. Many, and perhaps most,
bird-keepers are so anxious to rear the young that they make
few or no notes about them, and are content if at the end ot the
season they have doubled or trebled the number of any particular
species, a result which might often be more easily obtained at
less expense and trouble by a letter to some bird-dealer. Yet
opportunities of studying duration of incubation, down plumage,
methods of feeding have been allowed to slip by unnoticed.
Personally, I have found that birds will not resent an inspec-

tion of their domestic affairs if done judiciously and by the
right person. Strangers should, of course, never be allowed in
the aviaries during the breeding season, and the fewer people
that are taken to see the birds at that time, even outside the
aviaries, the better. Birds, however, soon get to know their
keepers provided they are usually dressed in much the same
manner and take but little notice of them. Any inspection of
the nests, etc. should be done as far as possible from the outside,
and when nests are actually visited it should always be in broad
daylight and if possible when the parents are off feeding. Close
observation will soon give a hint as to when the birds are laying,
and one or two visits will be sufficient to establish the exact date
of the laying of the first few eggs, they may then be left entirely
alone till they are nearly due to hatch, the exact date of which
can then be usually determined by further close observation and
one or two more visits and a note of the down plumage may be
made at the same time. During the first week or so, after the
young are hatched, they may generally be visited with impunity,
and notes made on the early growth of the feathers, and, at the
same time, one can see that they are being well and suitably fed ;
during the latter stages of feathering they should be left alone
as otherwise they are certain to leave the nest too soon.
Such, then, are a few hints, which if followed should cer-
tainly increase the chances of success. The true bird-lover who
knows and studies his charges will, of course, realise that these
broad notes must be modified and adapted to suit the individual
idiosyncrasies of every bird, for the lower animals have a great
amount of individuality which is too often ignored by their
keepers. Some of my readers may think the suggestions put
forward trivial in many cases and involving a good deal of
trouble; they have all, however, been founded on study, thought
and experience, and what can be obtained without trouble is
usually not worth obtaining. Of course, we cannot guarantee
success, but those who follow these instructions will at all events
deserve it, and even if they fail they will, if they be true bird-
lovers, be practically recompensed by the interest awakened and
knowledge gained from a closer study of their pets.

HUNSTEIN'S BIRD OF PARADISE.
By E. J. Brook.
I obtained my Hunstein's close on five years ago from an
</construct>
<bodyText confidence="0.99801052" page_id="32659301"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
importation brought over by Mr. Goodfellow for Mrs. Johnstone.
While these birds are amongst the most beautiful of the
Paradise birds in the matter of colouring, I cannot say that they
are particularly taking as aviary birds. The young Hunsteins are
lively enough while in their immature plumage, but when they
assume the adult feathering they become shy and sit like blocks
while anyone is watching them, or else they hide away in any
convenient bush. No doubt this is a provision of nature, and
instinct tells them that while they are in grey plumage they are
more or less inconspicuous and can move about freely, but when
they are in full colour their best means of remaining unseen is
to keep quite still and then their very colour is their safety,
resembling as it does the light and shade on the branches and
leaves of jungle growing beneath high timber. The shape of
these birds, too, is a protection to them, for when they are sitting
still, viewed from in front, they greatly resemble a heart-shaped
leaf, and the tail wires resemble tendrils.
I think the males get their full colour when about three
years old. I have not often seen the display owing to the shy-
ness already mentioned, and I am not at all sure that I have
ever seen the full display. The most I have seen is the expansion
of the breast feathers sideways and upwards, as well as the
raising of the small yellow cape like a halo or rough.
The Hunstein has a harsh rough grating voice, but he very
rarely uses it, I think this species is rather impatient of change

of temperature, mine have done much better since I moved them
to a compartment of my small bird-house, where the temperature
is kept at a fairly steady 6 o Q .
The diet is insectivorous and frugivorous, but they seem
to prefer fruit, and would I think thrive on that alone, anyway
for a long time.

Part II.
(Continued from page 163 J
Feb. 10th. This morning we are again in a broad river,
the Bahr el Jebel. Our progress through the cutting from the
Bahr el Zeraf has been very difficult. The channel is intended
chiefly for irrigation purposes, to prevent the darning back of too
much water by the sudd, with consequent loss by evaporation.
We were often aground in the shallows, on several occasions we
took the wrong turning and found ourselves in a cul-de-sac , and
our wheel was frequently clogged with sudd. The Bahr el Jebel,
in which we now are, is the river which flows from the Albert
Nyanza to Lake No, where, joining the Bahr el Gliazal, it forms
the main stream of the White Nile, which we had left near Kio.
The river is flanked on both sides by a perfect forest of Papyrus
plants, large feathery tufts at the end of long green stems, like so
many housemaid's mops. Some ot these plants must have stood
fifteen feet above the water. They extended as far as the eye can
reach on either hand, and the view is consequently monotonous;
in fact, the river flows through a desolate marsh at this point.
Bird life here is rare. Practically the only birds I saw up to five
p.m. were a few Black and White Kingfishers (Ccryle midis&amp;apos;), one
or two Waders and some English chimney Swallows (Hirundo
rustica) ; these Swallows were, however, present in large numbers.
I looked in vain for the Egyptian Swallow (Hirundo savignii)
with which I was familiar in lower Egypt. All appeared to be
H. rustica. They were busily employed hawking the all too
numerous insects, from which we had been suffering for some
days past. At five p.m. we entered the lagoon on which the

government station of Shambd is situated. Here we passed
several Hippopotami, some black Storks and some duck. At
Shambd we landed and walked to a native village inhabited
by the Dinka negroes. It was a great relief to be again on
shore, as we had not left the boat since daybreak on the 7th,
and were feeling rather cramped. The Dinkas are a less pre-
possessing people than the Shilluks. Their idea of clothing and
ornamentation apparently consists almost entirely in whitening
the body with wood ash. They possess, however, large herds of
cattle, which form the principal part of their wealth. Some of
these cattle had humps, others had not. Their most noticeable
feature, however, was the splendid pair of horns borne by each
beast. They were enormous and curved somewhat in the manner
of those of Highland cattle. There were several varieties, and
I see that Artin Pasha, in his recent book on the Soudan, states
that he was informed that the herdsmen manipulate the horns
when the beasts are young.
Feb. nth. This morning we wooded atKenissa and after-
wards passed again through banks of Papyrus and Ambash reeds.
Presently we came to a few trees, which are not too frequent on
this part of the river, covered with parasitic creepers. Hippo-
potami are common here. We came across small parties of six,
eight and ten together, and at one spot, where we turned a sharp
corner, I counted no less than twenty in sight at once. Croco-
diles were frequently seen. During the morning I saw several
specimens of the Hammerhead Heron ( Scofins umbretta). These
birds were generally in pairs, though I also saw some small
flocks of them. Bee-eaters of various species are very common
here. This evening a Gecko appeared on board. I caught it
and shut it up in my cabin in the hope that it may reduce the
number of insects there.
Feb. 12th. We arrived early this morning at the Govern-
ment station at Bor, where there is a rubber plantation. We left
at 6 a.m., and three hours later arrived at Malek, a station of the
Church Missionary Society. In the surrounding country are
numerous large ant-heaps (Termites), which are used by the
Dinkas as look-out places. The appearance of these people is
extremely barbaric. In addition to those whitened with wood-

ash, such as I saw at Shambe, I also came across some who had
coloured their bodies with a red clay. Some extremely gorgeous
individuals appeared with red bodies and white faces, or vice
versa. We are now well to the South of the sudd, and the
vegetation is becoming tropical. There are several Euphorbia
trees near that part of the river through which we steamed this
afternoon. I noticed several specimens of the Purple Heron
(Ardea piirpurea) and also some Goliath Herons (Ardea goliath).
These and the Saddle-billed or Senegal Storks, which I saw
further North, are perhaps the most striking birds I met with on
the journey. In the evening we landed at Sheikh Tomb6 for
wood. Here I saw several Agama lizards, having extremely
rugose skins. The heads of these creatures were of a brilliant
red colour. They seem to run to about nine inches in length.
At this wood station are some fine examples of the African
&lt;l Sausage tree," so-called from the resemblance of its fruit to
the familiar breakfast dish. I was informed by a fellow-traveller
that its leaves are used by the natives as a narcotic.
Feb. 13th. At ten a.m. we arrived at Mongalla, the chief
Government station of the Southern Soudan. A garrison is
situated here. There is also a hospital. We were met on the
landing stage by a tame Zebra, a well-known character in the
town, who appears to have a weakness for sugar. The Wellcome
floating Bacteriological Laboratory was moored here. The
Laboratory, which is most beautifully fitted up, is built on a
raft, and a steamer similar to our own but not so large is attached
to it. The doctois on board are at present investigating Sleeping
sickness, which is spreading northwards from the great lakes.
They most kindly showed me some very beautiful preparations
of the Trypanosome, which is the cause of the disease, and
which is conveyed by a species of Tsetsee fly. After leaving
Mongalla the river becomes much wider. There are many islands,
also shallows and sandbanks, on one of which we got stuck for
some time. On the banks I noticed several banana trees. At
five p. 111. we reached Lado, formerly the headquarters of Emin
Pasha. A sugar-loaf hill of great beauty, called Mount Lado,
lies about four miles behind the town. This is the first hill we
have sighted for several days, The atmosphere of Lado is hot,
airless and steamy, and a large bush fire in the neighbourhood

did not improve matters. Among the huts I saw several Cape
Doves (CEna capcnsis&amp;apos;). These very beautiful birds were quite
tame, and I could not help feeling how very desirable they would
be in an aviary ; they are of small size and exquisite colouring.
Here again the English chimney Swallows were present in large
numbers. We had hoped to arrive at Gondokoro to-night, but,
owing to the presence of sand-banks and shallows, we were
unable to do so. The stream is rapid and strong here, and it
was necessary to have natives wading in front of the boat to
find the channel. Often, we had to wind ourselves up on our
anchor as the only method of getting up stream. Finally, we
tied np for the night, a few miles South of Eado.
Feb. 14th. We reached Gondokoro, the northernmost
station of Uganda, at eight a.m., after dancing about from shore
to saud-bank for some three hours or more. The place is prettily
situated and well laid out. There are several palms about, The
river here separates Uganda on the eastern bank from the Soudan
on the western. In Gondokoro are many well-built brick houses
belonging to Indian and other merchants, in one of which I was
shown 150 fine Elephant tusks which had just arrived from the
surrounding neighbourhood. Some hills are visible from here,
and the atmosphere, though hot, is fresh, and there is a pleasant
breeze blowing. The river from Gondokoro to Rejaf is pic-
turesque. The channel is shallow and rocky, and there are
several islands about. The stream is swift, and it took us five
hours to steam the eleven miles between the two places. Several
small streams flow into the river. They are very rocky and are
suggestive of Scotch salmon rivers. Here I was lucky in seeing
some specimens of the Stanley Crane (Grtis -paradiseal). I under-
stand this bird is seldom met with so far north, so this is pro-
bably the extreme limit of its range. The country round Rejaf
is fairly well wooded, and there is a graceful hill at the back of
the station. The place stands high and affords some good views
over Uganda and the Eado Enclave. We remained here all
night ; the atmosphere was most refreshing after our journey
through the sudd, and the only disturbing element was the
occasional howl of a Hyaena.

By the Hon. Mrs. Bampfylde.
These experiences date from about two years ago, when
I first seriously started keeping foreign birds in aviaries, and
although I know there are many members of our Society far
better qualified than I am to write on this subject, I will en-
deavour to give my experiences, such as they are.
At the present time I have two aviaries--one about 8ft. by
4ft. by 8ft. high ; the other 10ft. by 5ft. by 10ft. high, the latter
having an outer flight about the same dimensions, thickly planted
with box, privet and other trees and shrubs and laid with turf.
Both aviaries are built 011 to a south wall; the inner portions
having cemented floors and several wooden tubs with evergreen
shrubs planted in them for cover. These are constantly removed
and replaced by new ones. There is a shallow cemented basin
in the middle of each floor and also in the outer flight, which I
find most valuable for bathing and drinking purposes. The
water in these basins is changed twice a day.
Each aviary is covered in front with movable glass shut-
ters, and is heated with hot water pipes. A small boiler, in which
we burn cinders only, heats both aviaries and keeps them to a
very even temperature of about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. I find
that here, on the borders of wild and wet Exmoor, 700 feet
above the sea, a certain amount of artificial heating is absolutely
necessary during the winter. I have found that the dry cold
affects my birds less than the constant wet weather, of which we
get more than our share during the winter and spring. At the
same time the intense heat of last summer was far more deadly
to the birds than almost any winter.
There is a system of electric lighting in both aviaries to
supplement the daylight in the winter mornings and evenings.
This plan has been most successful, as it undoubtedly enables
many of the smaller and more delicate birds to keep from hunger
and thirst and so from weakness and eventual death. The winter
before this there was no electric lighting, though all the other
arrangements were exactly the same as they are now, and the
loss then was infinitely greater than that of this winter, and this
I attribute entirely to the want of light.

I should have mentioned that the smaller aviary is divided
into three separate compartments, with wire doors from one to
the other. This arrangement has been most useful for separating
quarrelsome birds, and I have sometimes to breed individual
pairs in these small compartments, but they have always been
troubled with egg-binding, which presumably is owing to the
lack of proper space and exercise.
Having given this short description of the aviaries, I will
now try to give an account of their inmates.
In the larger aviary, with the outdoor flight, are to be
found the following:--Gouldians (Black and Red-headed), Parrot
Finches, Painted Finches, Bicheno Finches, Pintail Nonpareils,
Cuban Finches, Long-tailed Grassfinches, an Australian Fire-
finch (cock), Violet-eared Waxbills, Blue-breasted Waxbills,
Orange-breasted Waxbills, Cordon Bleus, Orange Cheeks, and
one or two other small African Waxbills.
I should mention that the Violet Ears (a very fine pair)
and the Firefinch are kept caged owing to their excessively
quarrelsome dispositions. Last February the Violet Ears (being
in a small compartment by themselves) started to nest. They
laid at first four eggs, on which they sat steadily for a week, the
cock bird taking his turn at sitting. Then they started to lay
again in the same nest but the hen, unfortunately, became egg-
bound. I was lucky enough to be able to save her, but, after
that experience, caged them both, as I did not think it wise
to let them continue nesting at that time of year, weakening
themselves unnecessarily when there was practically no chance
of rearing young birds. They laid six eggs altogether, and
made the most wonderfully constructed nest of ivy leaves and
pieces of the fir tree growing in a pot in their aviary. I had
purposely given them no nesting material, as I did not wish to
encourage nesting at that time of year. I shall hope to try them
again this summer, and, perhaps, if enough live insect food is
procurable, I may be fortunate enough to rear some young.
Unluckily their almost murderous dispositions make it abso-
lutely necessary to give them an aviary entirely to themselves.
With the Parrot Finches I hope to be more fortunate. I
have eight at present, and there are certainly two, if not three

pairs among them. I started the winter with seventeen of these
little birds and lost eight (nearly all from pneumonia, to which
they seem very liable) within a short time of their arrival. Two
pairs are now, to my regret, sitting, for I fear it is too early in
the year to rear young birds successfully. Parrot Finches are
the most delightful birds to keep in an aviary. Mine are very
tame and will come and pick up mealworms at my feet, and,
although they occasionally bicker among themselves, seem a
happy and peaceful little people.
My Gouldian Finches have been a source of disappoint-
ment. I have tried for the last two years to breed them, but
always without success. The old story of egg-binding has been
the chief cause of failure. Twice young ones have been hatched
here and lived for ten days, after which they were deserted by
the old birds, which thereupon started to nest again. One pair
are at the present time sitting, so once more are my hopes raised.
These birds, having been once acclimatized, seem very easy to
keep, though they are undoubtedly delicate when newly imported.
Last summer I bought six Pintail Nonpaieils (young birds out of
colour), four of these died in a few days, although they had
plenty of paddy rice and everything that seemed necessary to
their well-being ; however, their two survivors (a cock and a hen)
are still with me and in full colour and in beautiful plumage.
They seem exceptionally wild birds by nature, and up to the
present have shown no signs of becoming tame like all the
others. It may be of interest to mention that now they never
touch paddy rice, on which they lived entirely when they first
came here, but feed almost solely on spray millet.
Last November I purchased from Mr. Hamlyu eight Blue-
breasted Waxbills and two pairs of Bichenos, of which all were
newly-imported and out of which only one Blue-breasted Waxbill
died. Neither of these two last mentioned varieties seem any
trouble to keep in any way.
The Long-tailed Grassfinclies have built innumerable nests,
but have never yet got beyond sitting in them together side by
side, though I am unable to tell whether they are a true pair.
In the smaller aviary there are the following Painted
Finches, which I am hoping to nest successfully this summer, a

few more Gouldians and my soft-billed birds, which comprise
Yellow-winged Sugar Birds, Blue Sugar Birds, Violet Tanagers
and a Festive Tanager (cock).
The soft-billed birds I feed with the following mixture :--
Condensed milk, Mellin's Food and a little honey mixed together
in boiling water, with a little crumbled sponge cake added to it.
They also get plenty of bananas and grapes and a few mealworms
of which they are very fond. They are all delightfully tame,
especially the Blue Sugar Birds, which invariably fly on to my
shoulders and hands directly I enter their aviary, in the hope of
receiving a mealworm or a grape.
Of all the birds, I have always found the soft-billed ones
the easiest to keep in good health. They appear to feel the cold
and damp less than most of the seed-eaters, and are always in
beautiful plumage and condition, in fact I have not lost one
during the whole winter.

By W. A. Harding, M.A., F.L.S , F.Z.S.
Some years ago there remained in one of my aviaries--the
survivors of a number of others--a fine male Swainson's Lorikeet
and a hen Red-collared Lorikeet (Trichoglossus rubritorques). No
sooner had death deprived this pair of their noisy companions
and left them in sole possession of their abode than they began
to busy themselves with one of the nesting-boxes provided for
them. The box was not a particularly suitable one, and in order
to encourage the hen by the provision of a more natural nesting
place, a branch of a tree in my garden containing a Green Wood-
pecker's hole was taken down, cut to a suitable size ar.d set up in
the aviary. The cavity in the tree was some nine inches deep
and the circular entrance at the top of it was three inches in
diameter; the birds took to it at once, and after some time spent
in trimming the interior to her satisfaction, the hen began to sit.
The first attempt at nesting was unfortunate, and the faint
squeaking which announced the presence of a young one lasted

but two or three days. The next attempt, made later in the
same year, was somewhat less unsuccessful; a fully-fledged young
bird emerged from the Woodpecker's hole, but soon developed a
tendency to fits, and died like its predecessor.
Matters improved, however, during the following year,
when a healthy nestling was successfully reared, and this event
was repeated for several years in succession. Two white eggs
were always laid, but, as a rule, only one of them hatched out.
Incubation lasted about twenty-one days, and the fully-fledged
young bird did not leave the tree for several weeks. The hen
sat very closely, and both parents screamed with the greatest
resentment when their enclosure was entered during the nesting
season.
The hybrid offspring bore a yellow band on the nape,
flecked with red, and the red breast was without yellow feathers
at the sides; for the rest, it generally resembled its 'Blue
Mountain ' parent who, sad to say, died full of years and honours
a few days ago.
These birds occupied one of a block of four aviaries, each
compartment consisting of a house six feet square, opening on to
a flight twelve feet long and six feet wide and partly covered by
glass. The exterior treatment of the block was suggested by
one of the picturesque cabmen's shelters, many of which may
be seen in various parts of London, and the woodwork of the
flight was so arranged that a roll of wire-netting, six feet wide,
could be fitted to it with the minimum amount of cutting.

Ever since I first read Waterton's stirring description of
the tolling of the " Campanero " in the forests of Guiana I had
desired to possess one of these birds, and accordingly it was a
particular pleasure when I received one day from Mr. Jamrach a
fine male specimen of the Naked-throated Bell Bird ( Chasvior -
hynchus nudicollis, a pure white bird about the size of a Starling,
with a wide mouth and a somewhat evil expression. For some
days he had been silent in his new surroundings when, one
morning, I seemed to hear the village blacksmith exercising his
calling with extraordinary energy and clangour. For a time I
was really puzzled and deceived, and then remembering the new-

comer, approached him unseen and realised what was taking
place. The bird opened his mouth extremely wide, swelled out
his throat and, with a convulsion which shook his whole body,
emitted a high-pitched, metallic cry, far more piercing than the
screams of my Macaws, distinctly heard, as I afterwards ascer-
tained, nearly lialf-a mile off. This cry was scarcely bell-like,
but bore a remarkable resemblance to the clanging of a hammer
on an anvil, and was repeated at short intervals in the early
mornings during the ensuing spring and summer. The voice
of this bird, with its tale of tropical forests, was as music in my
ears, but my neighbours took a less romantic view and heartily
welcomed its untimely demise.
Bell Birds are certainly unsuitable for any but a country
aviary, but they are interesting and remarkable forms, and I hope
some day to come across Waterton's species (C. niveus) with the
long pendent caruncle, usually erroneously depicted as carried
erect, or the still more curious three carunculated species from
Central America.

My Waders' aviary is some 34 ft. long and 24 ft. wide, and
sufficiently high to enclose an apple tree and a number of shrubs.
A shallow concrete tray of water occupies the middle. The
water is a foot deep at one end, where it may be run off through
an ordinary bath plug let into the cement, and it runs out to less
than an inch deep at the other extremity. This trough has no
raised edges but slopes up almost imperceptibly into the sur-
rounding sand, beyond which is some rough turf, renewed every
year. The trough is often allowed to overflow and reduce its
banks to a sloppy condition so that the Waders may easily
plunge their beaks therein in search of food.
The staple diet supplied to the Waders consists of fish
cuttings minced in a machine, added to an equal quantity of a
mixture of half bread and half meal (usually pollard), the whole
being stirred to a soft paste with water. On this preparation
such birds as Godwits, Knots, Curlew, Oyster Catchers and Red-
shanks seem to thrive very well. Two years ago I introduced
half-a-dozen Black-headed Gulls into this enclosure, and they
soon began to rule the roost and proceeded to steal the eggs of

Mr. W. A Harding,
some Martinican Doves (Zenaida aurita) which had nested for
several seasons in a dove-cot fitted up for them near the roof. It
is always difficult to maintain a friendly equilibrium among a
diverse assortment of birds confined in the same aviary, and I
was about to restore peace by removing the Gulls when, last
Spring, two couples paired off.
Several nests were made and discarded, and much scream-
ing and quarrelling went on before the two hens finally settled
down and proceeded each to lay three eggs. At first the hens
were much disturbed by the other birds constantly running
before and behind them ; some Moorhens, which had multiplied
exceedingly in the enclosure, being particularly tiresome in this
respect. A semi-circular sheet of corrugated iron placed round
the back of the nest did much to abolish this difficulty, and the
cock bird, in each case, kept continuous guard in front, spending
his days in screaming at intruders and driving them off. When,
as occasionally happened, some wily bird escaped his vigilance
and the hen joined in the chase, it was his first care to drive her
back gently to the nest and stand by until she was sufficiently
reassured to settle down again upon her eggs. The shell of these
eggs is very hard and the inner membrane extremely tough, and
fully two days elapsed between the first chipping of the shell and
the final emergence of the chick. The mother, in both cases,
was too much occupied by her first two nestlings to trouble
further about the third egg, which having been laid last took
longer to incubate. The nestlings were covered with yellow
down spotted with black, and the two which have survived are
now with difficulty distinguished from their parents.
It was in this Waders' aviary that I once kept half-a-dozen
Penguins imported by Mr. Hamlyn. At first they refused to teed
themselves, and their tightly-closed beaks had to be forced open
whilst pieces of fish were pushed down their throats. This was a
somewhat serious operation, involving the efforts of two persons
and unpleasant for all the parties concerned ; the beaks of these
powerful birds were as sharp as razors, and one's hands were not
infrequently cut even when protected by gloves. A bite was apt
to end in blood poisoning, due possibly to a want of freshness in
some of the fish used, and on one occasion my assistant suffered

somewhat seriously from the result of such a wound. The birds,
however, soon learnt to feed themselves and became very tame,
running after me when I appeared with food, or jumping into
their trough and swimming about with extraordinary dexterity
and grace in anticipation of a scramble for the fish about to be
thrown into the water. They never would feed themselves upon
anything but whole fish, and herrings were the only things
acceptable to them in size which I could get in any quantity.
So long as the fresh herring supply lasted -- for the best part of a
year -- all went well, but there came a time when no more could
be obtained. Recourse had to be made once again to broken fish
and forced feeding, and sickness and death soon followed, ap-
parently as the result of some digestive trouble. To those who
can ensure a constant supply of the proper food no more delight-
ful and amusing creatures can be recommended than Penguins.
There is in my garden a piece of open water enclosing a
well-wooded island, and here live a number of Ducks, Swans,
Flamingoes and Gulls. Two years ago my Herring Gulls made
a nest on the ground during my absence from home, and my
gardener, in an excess of zeal, removed the two eggs in order to
preserve them for my collection. Last season, another nest with
three eggs was discovered, and all went well until a rat or weasel
put an end to my hopes. There seems to be no great difficulty in
breeding gulls. A sufficient number of individuals to insure the
presence of one or more pairs, plenty of room and absence of
vermin seem to be the essential requirements for success.
Regarding Flamingoes I can only confirm the observations
of others. It is surprising that such ornamental and haidy
creatures are not more frequently seen. Given shallow water
and the soft muddy bottom essential to the welfare of their feet
they are as easy to keep as Swans. Mine thrive w&amp;apos;ell on maize
alone and feed principally after sundown, when they may be
heard grunting and quarrelling over their trough of food. In
hard frosts care has to betaken lest their slender legs are injured
by ice, and on such occasions Swans are invaluable ice-breakers,
and generally maintain a piece of open water where all may
huddle together.
Peacocks out of plumage are not renowned for courage,

but what his hair was to Samson so is their spread tail to these
birds. On one occasion, a Peacock in full feather followed me
on my morning visit to the aforesaid island and, seeing a white
Swan sitting on her nest, was filled with the spirit of war.
Retiring to a distance he spread his tail, flapped his wings and
half ran, half sailed, with ever-increasing momentum, plump at
the sitting bird. The Swan rose up hissing and dangerous, and
I expected the worst consequences for her adversary. The
latter, however, retired in good order and once more, from a
distance, recommenced the charge. But the Swan could not
face the shock a second time and, flying precipitately, left the
Peacock preening himself in proud possession of the eggs.

Of various Parrots I have kept, perhaps Bouquet's Amazon
is the rarest. During a visit to the West Indies some years ago
I visited Dominica, and found a pair of these Amazons in a gin
shop in Roseau. After an animated discussion with the drunken
proprietor I obtained the birds for thirty shillings, and, fearing
lie might repent of his bargain, hurried off with one in each
hand, and spent the rest of the day in improvising a cage. Of
the other Parrot peculiar to Dominica I saw nothing. The
August Amazon inhabits the virgin forests which clothe the
most inaccessible parts of this mountainous island. It is known
to the natives by the strange name of " Cicero," and it is said
that not more than two individuals of this rare species are usually
seen at a time.
Chrysotis bouqueti, on the other hand, is gregarious and a
much commoner bird, inhabiting less unapproachable places.
Its local name is " Jacko." I was about to visit a plantation in
the district where it is found when an attack of fever cut short
my visit to the Island. As Canon Dutton noted some time ago
in these pages, Bouquet's Amazon is not a talker and, considered
as a pet, is a handsome but stupid bird.
On two occasions Mr. Cross has sent me alien Grey Parrot,
which has subsequently deposited two white eggs in her cage.
The last of these liens I still possess, and occasionally she plays
at nest-making, persistently pecking at the bottom of her cage
and, with one leg, vigorously kicking imaginary fragments of

wood out of her imaginary hollow tree. I have made one in-
effectual attempt to induce this bird to pair off and propose to
repeat the experiment again. A little Red-collared Amazon (C.
colla?ia ) I bought in Jamaica was able to say a word or two and
made an affectionate pet. The narration of its tragic fate shall
conclude these somewhat disjointed notes from an aviary.
In addition to birds, I keep certain wild mammals and snakes,
and in a heated out-house where the snakes lived were placed
one winter the Jamaican Amazon and a Grey Parrot. Mean-
while a slender Python, scarcely tour feet long, escaped from its
case and crept beneath a pile of heavy boxes, and as the house
was to be cleaned out within a week I postponed until then any
effort to recover so apparently harmless a creature. But next
-day the Grey Parrot was found dead in its cage, and so, a day or
two later, was my little collaria. The latter obviously had been
constricted and an ineffectual attempt had been made to swallow
him. The wings had proved to be too large a morsel for the
Python who, had he succeeded in engulfing his victim, would
have been caught in a trap, for he would have been far too stout
to crawl back through the cage bars with the bird inside him.
The Grey Parrot was found to have suffered from a diseased
heart, but I always think her death was accelerated by shock at
the sight of the snake.
THE BLUE CHAFFINCH OF TENERIFFE.
Fringilla teydca.
By Hubert D. Asteey.
In February, when staying near Puerto Orotava, I paid a
call on Senor Ramon Gomez, the chemist, and found that he had
half-a-dozen living specimens of the Teydean Chaffinch, which
he told me he had caught as young birds two summers ago
amongst the Pine Forests of the Island, in the neighbourhood
of the famous Peak of Teneriffe [El Teide], and I carried back
two pairs.
It is supposed that this species is only to be found 011

forests of the beautiful Canary Pine, always at a high altitude,
so that their habitat is a very confined one. I was told, however,
that this same Chaffinch is supposed to have been discovered on
the neighbouring island of Fuerteventura, but for the truth of
this I cannot be sure. If the bird is confined to one small island
in the whole world, it certainly must become extinct before long,
especially when naturalists are more and more interested in
procuring skins.
Mr. Meade-Waldo knows as much as anyone about the
Blue Chaffinch, and has contributed more than one note in the
Ibis. For instance, in the Vol. for 1893, p. 193, he wrote :--
"This beautiful Chaffinch, I am glad to say, appears to
"hold its own in all the pine forests of Teneriffe, and in one
"district seems to increase, owing, I believe, to a war waged

This Chaffinch is a good size larger than the English one,
the male being of a rich grey blue all over, with a narrow line of
white just over and under the eyes. The female is, roughly
speaking, greenish, a kind of dull brown green, but in the breed-
ing season she has a bluish tinge.
These birds have a loud chirp, somewhat Sparrow-like, but
sharper and more shrill, whilst the song bears a family resem-
blance to that of the European Chaffinch.
I was told in Teneriffe that an Austrian naturalist had
not long ago been shooting a great many--worse luck! and that
some of the inhabitants are realizing that the skins are sought
after by European collectors.

several of the islands have species or varieties peculiar to them.
On Palma, for instance, there is a Blue Chaffinch, but it differs
from F. teydea (Senor Gomez is my authority) in having two bars
of white across the wings, being much more distinct than those
in F. teydea , which are merely of a lighter shade than the rest
of the general colour. It is supposed that the Canary Islands
may be the remnant of the great lost Continent of Atlantis; at
any rate it is evident that the Blue Chaffinch is only to be found
there--and perhaps only on one island of the group.
The males are strikingly handsome, their colour is some-
what the same as that of the Blue Rock Thrush, but it is richer
and more uniform throughout. In shape and demeanour this
bird is a true Chaffiueh.
It would be very interesting if my Chaffinches would breed
in captivity, and I shall encourage them to do so.
Nine of these birds were imported in July of 1S93, which
were purchased by the authorities of the Breslau Zoological
Gardens, one pair of which paired off in a large cage. The hen
built her nest in a bushy branch within an open nest-box.
The nest consisted of hay, moss, charpie and feathers. The
male bird fed her all the time.
The period of incubation was 14 days, and the young were
fed by the hen with fresh ants' eggs and mealworms.
Several broods were successfully hatched.

The pair of Black-necked Swans on the Three-island pond
have hatched a pair of cygnets, which are up to the present
doing well. It is most interesting to see the parents brooding
them on their backs, the cygnets hiding away completely under
the old birds' wings. One of the photographs here reproduced,
shows a back view of the male Swan, and under one wing can
be seen the cygnets comfortably tucked away. The male Swan
has been rather savage all the winter, but latterly has become

person within the enclosure; but he rarely attacked his com-
panions the ducks, although he showed distinct animosity
towards any bird that had much white about it. A pair of
Rajah Sheldrakes had to be removed for this reason.
When I first took up my duties at the Gardens the old
male Black-necked Swan had been kept for some time in one
of the small duck paddocks, where he spent most of his time
waddling up and down the gravel path endeavouring to fight
with some Whooper Swans in the next inclosure. I found that
he had developed large warts on the base of his feet, which
made him quite lame. He was, therefore, removed to the pond
at the rear of the Fellows Pavilion, where he made advances
towards a female black Swan. Soon, however, I was able to
procure a mate for him of his own species, but I did not dare
to put the pair on the Three-island pond in case they should
persecute the defenceless Flamingoes.
As soon as the new pond at the Western end of the Gar-
dens was completed however, the Flamingoes were removed
thither and the Swans placed on the Three-island pond. Last
spring they nested but without result, the eggs proving addled.
This year they made a large nest on one of the islands, the hen
laying four eggs, two of which hatched after six weeks incuba-
tion. These are the first young birds of this species to be
hatched at the Zoo. since 1S79.
The old dilapidated aviary near the Apes&amp;apos; House has been
entirely rebuilt and formed into a six-compartment aviary, which
will be known as the " Summer Aviary." Each compartment
has a small pond and a shelter shed, and the whole is covered
with wire-netting of five-eights inch mesh, so that the smallest
birds can be kept. It is the best aviary we have had for breed-
ing, since it is so arranged that the birds can be fed and watered
without being in the least disturbed, and we hope to have con-
siderable success in the coming breeding season.
Of recent arrivals the most noteworthy are contained in a
small collection of birds from Colombia, presented by Mr. W. K.
Pomeroy, containing a very fine young Harpy Eagle, a pair of
very rare Purple Jays (Cyanocorax affinis&amp;apos;), two Golden Hang-

NOTES ON A HERRING GULL.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98309208" page_id="32659321"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
.Sir, --When passing the Gull's aviary at the Zoological Gardens the
other day I observed a Herring Gull behave in a manner which I think
must be most unusual.
It arose from the ground whilst in a sitting position, and when it
alighted dropped upon its breast. This was repeated twice, and although I
examined the bird very closely during flight, I could see no trace of legs;
in fact, I came to the conclusion that it was a trapped specimen and had
suffered amputation.
I was feeling very sorry for the bird and was wondering how it
managed to exist amongst its bullying brethren when it suddenly got up
and ran azvay. Had it been the first of April I could have understood
matters better than I do now. W. S. BKRRIDGE, F.Z.S.
THE BREEDING OF KNOTS.
Sir, -- I have often wondered why the Knot ( Tringa canutus) never
breeds in captivity, and I should be interested to learn if any members of
the Society who have kept these birds have ever noticed any signs of
nesting.
Even allowing for the fact that in the extreme north where these
birds naturally nest, the conditions are very different, yet one would have
thought that birds that do so well in confinement (personally I have found
them almost "impossible to kill") and yearly put on a sort of breeding
plumage, would, in exceptional cases at any rate, have nested.
I wonder if any member of the Society has ever seriously tried to get
them to nest by putting a few birds in a suitable place, apart from birds of
other species, and if so, with what result ?

Correspondence.
My attention was drawn to the matter to-day, by noticing a Knot
(a bird I have had some years and that has assumed its chestnut breast
rather earlier than usual this spring) busy, near the edge of water,
throwing bits of dried grass and other small bits of herbage from one side
to another and backwards over its shoulder.
There was, I feel sure, no mistake about the meaning of the action
being a remote suggestion of nesting. I do not for a moment suppose that
in my crowded aviary any nesting will result, but I think the action is
interesting as showing that possibly a slight change of conditions might
result in actual nesting. I have noticed a movement similar to the Knots
in a Reeve that actually nested and laid--also in many other birds, but
always in the spring and connected with nesting operations.
I am quite convinced that the Knot's movements had nothing to do
with food search.
Is it too much to hope that if trials were made on a wide scale, some
day nesting would result ? C. Barney Smith.
[The only approach to the nesting of this species took place in the
late Lord Lilford's Aviaries in 1893 and is noted in Prof. Newton's ' Ootheca,'
Vol. II., p. 207. Perhaps Mr. Cosgrave may be able to give us some
particulars as to the food and conditions under which these birds were kept
during that year. Of late years much has been discovered about the
nesting habits of this species. Mr. Manniclie, a Danish ornithologist, gives
a good account of their breeding habits, etc., in his book, " Meddelelser om
Gronlaud,' p. 130. He remarks that at this time of the year they are
largely, if not entirely, vegetable feeders, eating seeds of Carex and Luzula
Tufts. The breeding grounds were dry, stony, sparsely covered table lands.
Other observers have noted their feeding on the shoots of Saxifraga
oppositifolia and the nests found have been well concealed among rough
stones and boulders.--E d.]
RANDOM NOTES.
Sir, --I am sending you the following notes about my birds, but I am
afraid there is nothing to interest your readers as I am very much of an
amateur, and have only a large box-cage for my birds, and I have nothing
rare. My cage measures 27 inches long by 13J inches, and is iS inches high.
At present it has fifteen occupants, consisting of two Silverbills, two
Cordon Bleus, two Lavender Finches, two Orange Cheeks, two Zebra
Waxbills, two Cuban F&amp;apos;inclies, one Red Avadavat (cock) and one Fire-
finch (cock).
The 011I3' point of interest is that I have been very lucky with my
birds. The Cordon Bleus are my first and original pair, purchased three
years ago. One Lavender Finch is also my original one, purchased about

the same time, also the Fire-finch cock. They are all in beautiful plumage,
never a feather out of place. When I read of members buying several
pairs of Cordons and Lavenders before they can get a pair to live, I feel
very pleased with myself.
The cage has two small wooden nest-boxes hung on the back wall a
little way from the roof, and the birds sit on the top of these boxes for
hours at a time in preference to the perches. Some sleep in them at night,
and the Cordons often use them in the day-time, and sit side by side with
their heads peeping out. I have a branch of an apple tree tied to a long
perch running the full length of the cage, and they enjoy' all the small
twigs, which make a nice change from ordinary perches for their small
feet.
I feed them on Canary seed, white millet, spray, maw-seed, a little
Spratts' egg-food in winter. They eat a large quantity of grass in the ear
when we are in the country' in summer. They live in a nice sunny school-
room with a western aspect. The first year I had them the Cordon hen
laid a few eggs, but since then they' have shown no signs of mating, and
the cock has never sung his love-song with a piece of grass in his beak.
The Fire-finch hen also laid some eggs and died, and I have not replaced
her. Barbara Younger.

The United States covers such a vast territory, that in spite
of the activity of the numerous excellent ornithologists in that
part of the world, there is much to be discovered relating to the
distribution and habits of its bird fauna. As a contribution to
this subject, the volume before us by Mr. Sclater will admirably
fulfil its purpose. The names, both trivial and scientific, are
taken from the third edition of the A.O.U. Check List and
much valuable space too often devoted to synonymy has thus
been saved. Under each species we find the following heads:
(i) References to Colorado records, (2) Full description, chiefly'
of the adult male, and we feel that a little more space might have
been devoted to the fuller description ot the plumages of the
females and young. Mr. Sclater implies in his introduction that

-one of the objects of the book would be to enable the tyro to
identify the birds, and it is just the absence of reliable descrip-
tions of these lesser known plumages which often renders
identification of any particular bird a matter of difficulty to the
beginner.
Under the third heading is given the Distribution both in
the States, and, in greater detail, in Colorado itself.
The last heading deals with habits, both in and out of the
breeding season, site of nest, colour of eggs, etc. We have,
therefore, on the whole, a very complete account of the birds of
the country. At the end is given a long bibliography of papers
on Colorado birds and a geographical index or " Gazetteer." Mr.
Sclater has given us a thoroughly good book, to which he has
obviously devoted much careful work, and which should be for
many years to come the authority on the birds of that region.
We have only one small criticism to offer, and that is that the
measurements are given in inches instead of millimeters, which,
especially in small measurements, is a much more convenient
mi it.
THE GIZA ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS. *
The Report for the year 19n, on the progress of this
institution is to hand, and contains some very interesting sta-
tistics which show considerable progress. The largest stock of
animals kept there at anytime was maintained in 1911, and there
were only 295 deaths as compared with 380 in the previous year.
The number of birds at stock-taking was 988 as compared with
842 in the previous year.
One is apt to regard the climate of Egypt as ideal for a
Zoological Garden, but Captain Flower's Report opens one's
eyes to the fact that adverse conditions, of which we know
nothing here in England, sometimes prevail there to the detri-
ment of the live stock. For instance, during the year four very
severe wind storms, sand storms and dust storms occurred, while
earthquake shocks were felt in August. Fortunately no material
damage was done.

The London house cat is troublesome enough here, but the
authorities at Giza have a much more formidable foe in the wild
Jungle Cat, (Felis chans), a powerful animal which, during the
year carried off quite a number of birds, not to mention four young
goats. Hence it is not surprising perhaps to find that the list of
mammals bred in the Gardens is much longer than the list of
young birds reared. The latter indeed only contains two Black-
cheeked Lovebirds, one Java Sparrow and several Turtle Doves
of sorts, though several others were hatched, notably two Senegal
Stone Curlews and two Buff-backed Herons.
The Report is illustrated with several excellent photo-
graphs. D. S-S.

It is impossible in the space at our disposal to mention in
full the numerous interesting notes and articles in the three
numbers of this journal under review.
There can be no doubt that French ornithologists are
beginning to bestir themselves and we may soon hope to have
more precise knowledge of the birds to be found in their
country. Dr. Delmas concludes his Catalogue of the Birds of
l'Aveyron, and M. Babin gives a list of the Birds of the Canton
de Nemours, while other notes dealing with the native fauna
include an article by M. de Dumas on the food of the Hone}'
Buzzard, and migration notes on Swallows, Martins and Cross-
bills. The B&amp;apos;rench Colonies are represented by articles on
Tunisian birds and on the Tailor Bird (with black and white
plate) from Cochin China. Two articles deal more especially
with Aviculture, one 011 an Ostrich farm in Madagascar and the
other on the breeding of Egrets in the Jardin des Plantes. We
heartily recommend this Journal to British Ornithologists who
will find in it many valuable notes about the birds in which they
are most interested.

UPPINGHAM SCHOOL NATURAL SCIENCE
REPORT.

<bodyText confidence="0.9966113" page_id="32659326"  page_num="204" year="" vol="">
We have been favoured with a copy of the Uppingham
School Natural Science Report, and are pleased to notice that the
interest in Natural History is well maintained. The present
pamphlet contains notes and observations on the vertebrates met
with during the year. 1911 does not seem to have been particu-
larly noteworthy in the way of rarities observed, but the short
notes on the commoner species are not without their interest.
We learn, for instance, that the Whitethroat was much scarcer
than usual and that although the usual numbers of adult
Cuckoos were seen very few young appear to have been reared.
Perhaps the most important note from the scientific point of
view is that of the Little Owl, which is now common in the
district. The contents of nesting holes and pellets were care-
fully examined, and its chief food seemed to consist of beetles,
insects and mice, with very few small birds, Tits, Wrens,
occasionally a young Thrush, and one water rat. No remains of
game birds whatever were found. Mr. Constable, however,
noticed a growing scarcity of small birds, which he considers
may be partly due to the Little Owl, disturbing the birds and
causing them to seek " fresh fields and pastures new."

XV.--LARKS.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Our Editor has asked me to contribute an article upon
these birds although my experience of them is limited to three
species: -- the Skylark, Woodlark, and Mongolian Lark, other
more competent members of our Society not having been willing
to help him. He says :--" to have kept one species and studied
it is better than to have had fifty and just fed them in a cage."
Of course this is true, and, therefore, I am doing what I can
towards helping those with even less experience.
The Larks are related to the Finches and Pipits but differ
from all their relatives in having the back of the tarsus scaled as
well as the front. The form of the bill in the various genera
differs to an extraordinary degree, being slender, as that of a
Warbler in some ; long and tapering with a slight terminal curve
(so as almost to recal the Hoopoes) in Certhilazida ; broad, short
and notched like that of some Buntings in others. Unlike the
Finches, the bills of Larks do not seem to afford good sexual
distinctions, but as a general rule the males may be distinguished
from the females by their superior size, broader chests and
noticeably longer wings (see my little book " How to sex Cage-
Birds," p. 92); the hind claw is also said to be longer in the
males than in the females, but I have hitherto had no opportunity
of confirming the statement.
Being related to the Finches and Pipits, the Larks natur-
ally feed both upon seeds and insects, and therefore should have
both in captivity. A good insectivorous mixture, a tea-spoonful
of canary-seed and two or three mealworms, smooth caterpillars,
or spiders daily, constitute the most suitable diet for caged Larks ;
a fresh clovery turf, a little groundsel, chickweed, or chopped
lettuce should also be given when obtainable.
As these birds do not wash, but dust themselves after the
manner of fowls, they should have abundance of fine fresh sand,
in which to perform their cleansing operations. Being subject
in their natural state to showers, it does not hurt them to occasion-

ally sprinkle them with a fine syringe ; but as they are unable,
unless kept in a spacious aviary, to get sufficient exercise to dry
them rapidly and restore them to their normal temperature, it is
not advisable to overdo that sort of thing ; and the safer plan, in
my opinion, is to abstain from the practice altogether.
Unless you possess both sexes of a species and desire to
breed from them, Larks are far better kept in cages than aviaries ;
in the former they not only sing much more frequently, but they
can be better attended to. The cage should not, as a rule, be
lofty ; and, for recently acquired birds, which are nervous and
liable to spring recklessly upwards at the risk of concussion or a
broken skull, the roof should be of canvas ; for well-established
birds however this is unnecessary, and then it may either be
of wire or wicker-work, the latter being preferable. For the
common Skylark I found the ordinary runner-cage, two feet in
length, about seven inches in width and nine in height, with a
central door, most suitable : I used to turf one end, thickly sand
the other, hang food and water on the front and put a small pan
of canary-seed inside.
The Chinese cage for thick-billed Larks is circular with a
central one-legged table upon which the bird mounts to sing :
the only objection to this cage is that it is not large enough to
give the inmate much exercise : I therefore got the late Mr.
Abrahams to have a special cage constructed for my Mongolian
Lark ; it was of the waggon pattern, with overarched willow bars
and a sufficient depth of wood to enable me to cover the floor
with abundance of sand ; the back and ends were of wood and
the length of the cage two feet: a movable slip in front admitted
a scraper for cleansing the floor, and the sand was poured in
through the top bars: food and water pans slid in from the front
at either end just above the sand : this bird lived in perfect
health to a good age.
Larks roost at night upon the ground, so that whether in
cage or aviary they should not be subjected to possible attacks by
either rats or old buck mice (the latter are often equally danger-
ous). Rat or mouse-virus, when it can be obtained in good
condition, is most effective; but I am afraid, now that it has
made a name for itself, it is by no means so satisfactory as when

first placed upon the market: in 1911 I sent for two tubes of
mouse virus and a phial of Rattine and although I carefully
prepared them according to instructions, not a mouse was
destroyed by any of them : in 1910 one tube of mouse-virus
cleared off every mouse on my premises.
Unlike most birds, harks appear to sing instinctively ;
that is to say, instead of learning from their parents, the wild
song appears to be hereditary. I have taken Skylarks from the
nest when six days old and hand-reared them, and one of these,
though a hen, sang the well-known song of its species ; others
taken when fairly well feathered not only produced their own
natural song, but introduced into the performance parts of the
songs of other birds in my possession.
My first attempts at handrearing Larks were not successful,
the whole of them having died from cramp, although kept warm
in a basket of hay and covered with flannel at night. Considering
that in their wild state birds would be crouching together in a
nest placed in a hollow or depression in the earth, I concluded
that moist warmth to the legs was necessary in their infant
stage; I therefore cut a hole in a thick turf and inserted therein
a Whitethroat's nest, in which I placed my nestling Larks,
covering them with a piece of flannel to represent the mother-
bird : from that time forward I had no further difficulty in rearing
Skylarks.
I have had no experience in breeding Larks, and for that
reason I should have been better pleased if our friend, Mr.
Reginald Phillipps, would have consented to undertake this
article. I should imagine that, at first, these birds would recprire
a considerable amount of living insect-food for their young; a
point upon which, I think, Mr. Phillipps, does not speak defin-
itely in his account of the nesting of the Black Lark. Soiled
hay seems to have been preferred for the nest; not I should
imagine to render the latter less conspicuous, but because it
would be easier to mould than when fresh and stiff.
Many years experience in bird-nesting convinced me that
birds selected such suitable materials as were nearest to hand,
without considering whether the use of these would render their
homes conspicuous or the reverse : the only Chaffinch nest which

I ever found completely covered outside with grey-white lichen
was placed in an elm-hedge skirting a wood and was so glaringly
conspicuous that no passer by could possibly fail to notice it:
the lichen had been obtained from a tree a few feet behind in
the wood. This is not an isolated instance; the nest of the
Long-tailed Tit is frequently a prominent object in a roadside
hedge, and consequently tempts the young clodhopper to exhibit
his destructive instincts.
In the foregoing observations I have dealt chiefly with
those Larks which spend a considerable part of their existence
upon the earth or near it. but there are others, such as the Wood-
lark, which often settle upon the tops of hedges or the branches
of trees, and for these it is necessary to provide loftier cages
supplied with perches for their use during the daytime : at night,
like other larks they rest upon the ground. Even a Skylark can
settle upon a branch, and one which I kept in an aviary frequently
did so, but it looks awkward in that position with its long hind
claw pointing straight downwards.

NOTES ON SEXUAL SELECTION.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
Part I.
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.980901884615385" page_id="32659339"  page_num="209" year="" vol="">
As most of my readers know, Darwin's celebrated theory
of Sexual Selection argues that the superiority in appearance of
male birds, so often notable, is due to the selection, through
untold ages, of the handsomest males by the hens; and, as there
is extremely little direct evidence in favour of this view, and
what little there is has been chiefly furnished by aviculturists, it
seems worth while to review the subject; since the theory will
in the end probably have to stand or fall on the verdict of avi-
culturists, who are or should be, I have always maintained, the
most truly scientific of ornithologists, our hobby giving us the
most perfect control of the only scientific method, that of obser-
vation and experiment.
I11 the first place it is as well to enumerate briefly the
forms taken by sex-differences among birds, choosing one's
examples as much as possible from species well-known in avi-
culture. We find then, where the male is the superior sex
the following forms of difference:--
I. Male similar to female in size (or nearly so) and structure,
but richer in colour :--European Chaffinch (Fringilla
ccelebs ), Scarlet Tanager ( Rhaviphoccelus brasilius ) and
numberless others, this being far the commonest form
of sex-difference.
II. Male not only richer in plumage than female, but possessing
special structural decorations :--Common Fowl (Gallus
gallus), Peacock (Pavo cristatus), the Birds of Paradise
and many others, this being the next commonest type.

Mr. Frank Finn,
III. Male similar to female (or nearly so) in plumage, but with
structural decorations :--Condor (Sarcorhamphus gryp-
hons&amp;apos;) ; Turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) ; Great Bustard {Otis
tarda ) ; Australian Musk-duck ( Biziura lobata) ; Muscovy
Duck ( Cairina moschata)* ; these are all the cases I
know of of this kind.
IV. Male simply much larger than female, otherwise similar ; the
Australian lark-like birds of the genus Cinclorhamphus.
V. Male like female, but with special weapons, i.e. spurs ;
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.67368" page_id="32659340"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
Eared Pheasants ( Crossoptilon ) and many Francolins
( Francolinns, Pternistes).
VI. Sexes alike in size and plumage but with a difference in the
"soft parts":--Budgerigar (. Melopsittacus undulatus).
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.947814714285714" page_id="32659340"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
Cases rare, but often found in combination with I. and
II. i.e. plumage and eye or beak-colour both different.
In some cases these differences are permanent, as in the
Fowl ; in others the male has a distinctive plumage (or
beak colour) only during part of the year, generally only
during the breeding season, as in the Indigo-bird
( Cyanospiza cyanea ), the Whydahs, and many of the
Ducks.
The few converse cases, where the female is the superior
sex, fall under three classes:--
I. Female of same size as male but brighter:--Eclectus
Parrots ( Eclectus ), Paradise Duck ( Casarca variegaia). A
rare case.
II. Female both larger and brighter than male :--Phalaropes
</bodyText>
<table confidence="0.852540111111111" page_id="32659340"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
(. Phalaropus ), most Hemipodes ( Turnix ).
III. Female larger than male, but duller :--Harriers ( Circus ),
Kestrels ( Tinnimculus) ; Blackbird ( Merula merula) ;
some Bustards ( Sypheotides auritus, &amp;c.)
IV. Female simply larger than male, otherwise similar:--
Emu ( Dromceus australis) ; Cassowaries (Casualins&amp;apos;) \
Kiwis (Apterygidae) ; Tinamous (Tinamidae) ; Jaganas
( Pa) ridae .)
* I am speaking here of the wild Muscovy Duck, in which the female has no bare

<bodyText confidence="0.970118" page_id="32659340"  page_num="210" year="" vol="">
eye-cere or beak-knob; in domestication she usually shows these points, an interesting
case of transference male characters to the female without human selection, as Muscovy
Ducks are not "bred to points."

V. Female like male, but with brighter " soft parts " ; Asiatic
Jabiru ( Mycteria australis ); some Cockatoos ( Cacatua
leadbeateri , sulphurea and roseicapilld). In these the iris
is brighter in the female.
No female bird possesses special structural decorations or
weapons, so that for some reason or other evolution in the direc-
tion of female superiority does not (? cannot) proceed very far.
Sex-similarity, on the other hand, is of two kinds:--
A. Both sexes may be dull, or have plumage of a type which
is feminine in allied species which show masculine
superiority ; e.g. Corn-bunting ( Emberiza miliaria&amp;apos;) ;
Australian Wild Duck ( Anas superciliosa ). An extremely
common case, applying often to whole families.
B. Both sexes may be bright, or have plumage which is
masculine in species showing masculine superiority ; e.g.
Goldfinch ( Carduelis caiduelis) ; Superb Tanager (Calliste
fastuosa) ; Chilian Wigeon ( Alareca sibilatrix ). A com-
paratively rare case, but still sometimes found in whole
groups.
C. Both sexes may have special weapons, e.g. Cassowaries
</bodyText>
<equation confidence="0.553359" page_id="32659341"  page_num="211" year="" vol="">
( Casuarius) ; Spur-winged Geese (Fleet ropier us) and all
</equation>
<bodyText confidence="0.979194529411765" page_id="32659341"  page_num="211" year="" vol="">
Spur-winged birds of any sort.
D. Both sexes may have special structural decorations--
special by comparison with their young or their nearest
allies ; e.g. Guinea-fowls (Numidinae), especially the
hackled Vulturine (Acryllium vulturinum).
E. Both sexes may be alike, but have different voices, e.g.
many ducks, whether of dull or bright plumage.
As in the case of sexually differing birds, the decorations
of similar-sexed birds may be seasonal, a most striking case
being the " Osprey" plumes worn by breeding Egrets (Herodias),
and the ruff of the Crested Grebe ( Podicipes crislatus).
There is one case of a seasonally developed weapon in the
Pheasant-tailed Ja^anas (Hydiophasianus chirurgus) in wdiicli the
wing-spurs are only developed in the breeding-season.
There are, of course, plenty of cases wdiicli connect various
classes :-- e.g. in the Blue Tit (Pams cczruleus) and Gouldian
Finch (Poephila gouldice), the sexes are both richly coloured, yet

<bodyText confidence="0.98644385" page_id="32659342"  page_num="212" year="" vol="">
Mr. Frank Finn,
the female is noticably the duller of the two ; in the Turkey, the
cock only has well-developed structural decorations, and is also
far larger than the hen ; and many birds have a plumage which
can hardly be called rich, but yet shows a distinction between
the sexes, or between both sexes and duller allies ; for instance,
the cock Sparrow (Passer domesticus ) is not a richly coloured
bird, but masculinely bright in comparison to the hen, as are
both sexes of the Tree-Sparrow ( P . montanus ) compared to many
finches, such as the Rock-Sparrows ( Petronia ) ; but on the whole
the classes are pretty definite.
Sometimes several differences will be found between near
allies; this is particularly well shown in the duck family, e.g. all
the nearest allies of our common wild duck ( Anas boschas ) have
plumage, in both sexes, much like the female of that bird ; but
in the three kinds of Wigeon ( Mareca) we get one with both sexes
of a masculine type (the Chilian), while the other two have bright
males and dull females. Similarity of general habits, then, has
nothing to do with sex-colouration ; nor does this similarity
affect the question of the superiority of the male over the female
sex or vice versa, since the Ffemipodes and Tinamous, in which
the female is the finer bird, agree in general habits most closely
with quails and partridges, in which many kinds have superior
males.
We may now pass to the question of display, and in regard
to this the following facts seem to be well established :--
I. Most (probably all) birds display in some way or other,
whether dull or blight, specially decorated or not. Profi
A. R. Wallace has emphasized (Darwinism) the display
of dull-coloured birds, e.g. goatsuckers, geese and vul-
tures ; Mr. Howard (British Warblers) has shown that
warblers do it ; Mons. G. Rogeron (Les Canards) has
pointed it out in the case of the dull-coloured allies
of the Mallard. The display of bright-coloured and
decorated birds needs no comment; everybody knows
it, whether aviculturist or not !
As Darwin says, all individuals of a species display in the
same way ; it may also be pointed out that nearly allied
species do so, whether bright or dull, as in the case of
II.

the duil ducks above mentioned, which display in the
same attitudes as the brightly-coloured Mallard drake.
III. The display is often provoked by other emotions than
amatory passion, e.g. anger; anyone can see this in the
case of the Turkey and Muscovy duck, both of them
irritable as well as amorous birds, and I have observed
it in many species; the common Moorhen ( Gallinula
chloropus) shows it very well.
IV. The female, both in plain and decorated species, displays
as well as the male in many cases, and generally in the
same attitude, e.g. the Peahen may be seen to show off
to the Peacock with erect and expanded tail ; I have
seen her do this both when the cock was displaying and
when he was not (different pairs in each case). Similarly
females as well as males may fight for the favours of the
opposite sex, as Mr. D. Dewar has seen with the Paradise
Flycatcher ( Terpsiphone paradisi).
V. Young male birds [e.g. young Peacocks and Gold Pheasants)
display before they are decorated, and birds which change
their plumage may do it when out of colour (Jackson's
Whydali ( Drepanoplectes jacksoni) and Blue Wren
(.Malurus cyaneus).
VI. The display generally brings out the birds' best points,
i.e. emphasizes the masculine characteristics or what
decorations the species may possess if both sexes are
decorated. This is well seen in the courtship of the
Sparrow and in the erection of the long head- and back
plumes in Herons.
VII. Display generally leads to fighting as well, as in the tour-
naments of Ruffs (. Pavoncella pugnax) and Blackgame
(Tetrao tetrix) ; but some very ostentatious birds rarely
fight, though they drive each other about and show much
courage in encounters with other species, e.g. Peafowl
and Mandarin ducks (Aex galericulata ) ; while some do
not even meet each other when displaying; like the
Argus Pheasant ( Argusianus argils&amp;apos;) and so cannot fight,
though fierce enough.
VIII. Males may assemble and display without any females

Mr. Frank Finn,
being present, as Mr. W. Frost has shown with the
Cock-of-the-Rock ( Rupicola crocea).
IX. Birds may display in autumn, but no aviculturist will
attach any importance to this; it simply means that they
are again in breeding form after the moult, and would
doubtless breed if not checked by the oncoming winter.
X. Hens very, very rarely, show any appreciation of the display
that we can perceive. It is needless to labour this point,
the apparent indifference of the hen being so much in
contrast to the excited energy of the male. She may
even appear to be irritated ; everyone must have seen
the hen Sparrow attack the displaying male.
XI. Where the hen is a finer bird than the cock, she displays,
and also does the fighting if there is any done ; she is
in fact, masculine in character as well as in plumage
and size.*
With regard to other methods of courtship or special
sexual activity at the breeding season, we have to reckon with
song and gifts of food : --
I. Generally only the male sings or gives a special call ; but
the female usually can , and often does when alone, e.g.
Virginian Cardinal ( Cardhialis virgmianus). In some
cases, however, e.g. in many cases, the voices of the
sexes are absolutely limited to them, and apparently
depend on structural peculiarities in the windpipe, as
anyone can see with the two domestic ducks, Common
and Muscovy.
II. Song uttered under the influence or auger or even fear, as
well as amatory passion ; skylarks and robins sing, as
cocks crow, when challenging each other; the skylark
will sing in snatches when chased by a hawk, and I have
heard a bantam cock crow while his overgrown spurs
were being pared down and he was held in the hand.
III. Song or male calls usually irritate rival males intensely;
I have seen two cock fowls manoeuvre about a lot, but
not fight till one crowed.
* I have, however, seen the male Kufous Tinamou ( Rhynchofus ru/escens) display to
the female, drawing himself up and expanding forward his cinnamon primaries; as in
other Tinamous the sexes in this bird are coloured alike, but the hen is larger.

<bodyText confidence="0.993523210526316" page_id="32659345"  page_num="215" year="" vol="">
IV. Song is much noticed by females in some cases; hen
canaries often annoy breeders by " pairing by the voice "
with undesired mates ; and the hens of some of the
almost dumb (to our ears) Mannikins (Munia) listen
intently to the song of the males.
V. In species where the female is superior she calls most, or
most strongly ; but such birds never have an elaborate
song, any more than structural decorations.
VI. A species may combine the two attributes of high colour
and structural decoration and a musical voice, though
this is rare, an example being the King Bird of Paradise
(Cicinnurus regius), but many bright-plumaged birds sing
very well, e.g. Goldfinch, Pekin Robin ( Liothrix luteus),
Virginian Cardinal.
But the very best songsters of all are usually plain, though
the majority of plain birds, it must be remembered, are no better
singers than the gaudy ones. Exceptional song, like exceptional
plumage, is a rare gift, and as in the case of plumage, we find
great differences among near allies.
With regard to the other amenities of courtship, gifts of
caresses, we have to notice:--
I. The male generally feeds the female, not vice versa.
II. Feeding may be done from the crop, in which case it often
runs in families, e.g. all cock parrots and pigeons feed
their females, though all finches do not ; or the food
may be brought and given from the beak, in which case
there are differences in the practice of members of the
same family, e.g. the common cock, the Satyr Tragopan
( Cerior?iis satyr a), and the Peacock Pheasant {Polyplectron
chinquis) feed their females, but the Common, Gold and
Amherst Pheasants do not, nor does the Peacock.
Among the ducks, the Carolina (Aex sponsa) alone seems
to feed the female.
III. In many birds no love feeding is ever done, as in the case
of the Sparrow.
IV. Among birds with masculine attributes in the female, the
lieu Hemipodes feed their males, as Mr. D. Seth-Smith
has shown.

mates.
The custom of caressing, usually head-tickling, offers these
peculiarities
I. Both sexes do it, but the male most as a rule.
II. It runs through groups to a great extent ; e.g. Parrots and
Pigeons, and the Mannikin and Waxbill groups of
Ploceine Finches, are all great head-ticklers ; but it
may crop up in more or less isolated cases, thus, among
the ducks, the Mandarin and Carolina, the Tree-ducks
{Dendt ocycna), and the Or inoco Goose (Cheiialopex ju-
batus), seem to be the only practisers of the habit. The
majority of birds do not caress their mates at all.
III. Caressing species will fondle their own sex, if without
mates, and will also caress even non-caressing species.
I now pass to some considerations about the bird mind,
as we know it; the following conclusions have suggested them-
selves to me :--
I. Birds, like ourselves, are guided by sight only, and see
much as we do ; i.e. they are not colour-blind. The
mistakes they make prove this ; hen-feathered cocks
were objected to by '' cockers, - ' because their rivals in
the pit mistook them for hens; and any harmless bird
at all resembling a hawk is much feared at first. Birds
often hate species which display similar colours, e.g, I
have seen the Blue Wren (Malums cycineus) violently
persecute the Red-legged Sugar-bird (Ccereba cya?iea).
They must also be able to observe detail, for otherwise
they would not know their own mates ; all our observa-
tion of them shows they do know these where we can see
the differences.
II. On the other hand, they have no "refinement"; those
species which collect objects show a blind love for any-
thing bright and strange only, and they nest in the
ugliest situations as well as the most beautiful.
III. They generally hear as we do ; witness the often perfect
imitation of the human voice by many birds.
But here again, they have no "refinement," the best singers

will sing in answer to a sewing-machine or a frizzling
fry - pan ; and mockers like the Shama ( Cittocincla
macrura ) pick up bad notes more readily than good,
while parrots love coarse oaths.
V. What tastes they do have, run in species and even groups ;
e.g. most typical finches like hempseed, most crows steal,
certain birds always use feathers in their nests or even
snake-sloughs, &amp;c.
VI. They "fall in love" and take dislikes, as anyone may see
with the relations of pet birds to their human associates ;
and it is well known that partridges, for instance, are
best left to pair themselves, and some species, not meet-
ing in nature, hate each other when brought together ;
for instance, the Paradise Duck ( Casarca variegata) and
Upland Goose ( Chlo&amp;apos;ephaga magellanica&amp;apos;). They may
form bachelor or spinster friendships; and may do this
with alien species and with beasts.
VII. They can discern the sexes of alien birds, even when very
different ; e.g. two different hen common pigeons I had
at different times along with fowls, many years ago, both
became attached to the cock, and wanted him to pair,
but he would not; one also hated the hens, and would
attack them when they could not trample her, by reason
of being on a perch or laying.
VIII. They at once recognise a similarity in note; e.g. I have
heard a Pekin Robin answer the call of the Wryneck
(lynx torquilla).
IX. They recognize their own species independently of varia-
tions in colour, shape, and size; the behaviour of
domestic poultry of different species (barring occasional
aberrations of conduct, most frequent in turkeys and
ducks) proves this, and yet there is hardly any evidence
that birds go at all by scent. Moreover, allied species
of different colours associate at once, as we see with the
different species of Mannikins.

Part III.
(Concluded from page 185^.
P&amp;apos;eb. 15th. At sunrise we started on our homeward journey,
and at 8.30 a.111. landed at a village of Bari negroes, where we
obtained some bananas. As we had had 110 fresh fruit for over
a week these were much appreciated. We got back to Gon-
dokoro without much difficulty, but from there to Lado we had
an uncomfortable passage owing to the swiftness of the current
and the frequency of shallows. A short distance north of
Mongalla I saw eight Marabou Storks (.Leptoptilus crumeniferus).
Towards evening we were obliged to tie up, a few miles south of
Kiro, on account of the difficulty of navigation. About 9 p.m.
we heard the distant sound of a tom-tom, and, meeting some
Baris in the scrub, we were guided through the forest to a village
where the natives were dancing in honour of the full moon. We
walked for about three quarters of an hour, disturbing a Hip-
popotamus near the river, who straightway made for the water
with much grunting. The scene at night was very beautiful, and
the trees and parasitic creepers showed up to great advantage.
We heard some elephants trumpeting in the distance. Arrived
at the village, we were welcomed by the Sheikh, and then
witnessed the dance which was more energetic than elegant.
The whole village took part--men, women and children--beating
time with small bones which they carried, after the style of
Christy minstrels. A large fire burning in the midst gave a
weird effect to the dancers. One of our cabin boys so far forgot
himself as to join in. Later, we went through the village and
saw a large flock of goats which were penned up for the night
in a large wooden cage, in the middle of which a fire burned
as a protection, I was told, against wild beasts. We returned to
the boat shortly after midnight.
Feb. 16th. We started at daybreak, and early in the morn-
ing I saw some Baboons (Papio anubis). We wooded at Sheikh
Tomb6, and, shortly after leaving that place, we went aground
on a sand-bank, where we remained for over two hours. Here

we caught some coarse fish, which, unfortunately, were not
a very great success 011 the table. I saw some specimens of
the brilliantly coloured Green-backed Purple-coot (. Porphyria
smaragdonotns), also a beautiful Crested Kingfisher ( Corythornis
cyanostigmd). There were many bush fires in this part, some of
very great extent. This wasteful burning of the trees by the
natives is regrettable, as wood is not over plentiful, and a great
deal is required by the river steamers. We reached Bor at 7.30
p.m. and tied up for the night.
Feb. 17th. This morning we reached the wood station of
Kenissa at eleven o'clock, on leaving which we entered again
into the sudd. I saw little of interest, except a large flock of
Night Herons ( Nycticorax griseus) which were perched on some
low bushes having brilliant yellow flowers. These were growing
on one of the small islands in the sudd, with which one occasion-
ally meets and on which one may sometimes see an isolated palm
tree. In the afternoon we passed the entrance to the lagoon on
which Shambd is situated. Towards evening a cool north wind
sprang up.
Feb. 18th. We passed the cutting into the Bahr el Zeraf,
down which we came on our journey south, at three a.111. this
morning, but, instead of turning into it, we continued our course
up the main stream. This was a dull and uninteresting day ;
hardly any birds were to be seen and only two hippopotami. A
high wind started blowing towards evening, but, in spite of it,
we still suffered from mosquitoes.
Feb. 19th. We passed through Take No shortly after
midnight, and at eight o'clock this morning we again saw firm
ground, with trees and villages. A terrific wind from the north
lashed the river into waves and caused our boat to roll con-
siderably. At noon we wooded at Khor Attar, where there is a
Shilluk village. Here I obtained some spears made from the
horns of the Waterbuck straightened out. These are not very
common as most of the native tribes use iron spears made in
Omdurman. At 1.30 p.m. we arrived at the mouth of the Sobat
river. This tributary rises in the mountains of Abyssinia. The
colour of the water is light green, which contrasts with that of
the White Nile, which is brown. The line of confluence is very

sharply marked. At the mouth of the river are the ruins of an
old fort, built by Lord Kitchener at the time of the Fashoda
incident. We steamed up the Sobat as far as Doleib Hill, a
station of the American Presbyterian Mission. The river is
narrow, the banks fairly wooded and covered with high coarse
grass. There were several bushes of the poisonous Sodom Apple.
I saw a large flock of Marabou Storks. The mission station is
prettily situated in a grove of Palms, and possesses a garden
containing orange, lime, papoia and custard-apple trees, also a
banana plantation. They have a small farm, with a good short-
horn bull, which has to be kept in a mosquito-proof shed, and a
poultry run containing fowls, turkeys and guinea-fowls. The
missionaries do good medical work, and I was shown many cases
of leprosy, elephantiasis, and other strange exotic complaints ;
in fact, their little hospital might be regarded as a veritable
zoological garden of disease. Several Eucalyptus trees have
been planted about the station, which are doing extremely well.
In the garden I saw a pair of Long-tailed Glossy Starlings (Lam-
protornis caiidatus). After leaving the Mission we returned to
the White Nile and continued our course north, arriving at 6
p.m. at Taufikia, an important military station. Here we remained
a couple of hours and I again saw some Glossy Starlings. There
were several Grey Herons ( Ardea cinerea ) near the town. In the
evening the strong head wind continued and it became quite cold.
Feb. 20th. We passed Kodok (Fashoda) at one a.m. and
Melut at 8.30. The wind continued very high and we were
obliged to put up the awnings on deck to keep the spray out.
I11 the afternoon we arrived at Meshra-el-Zeraf, a new wood-
station in the middle of a fine game country. Here we remained
several hours and I took the opportunity of going for a long walk
into the scrub, which consisted, as usual, of Acacias and Mimosa
bushes. Birds were very numerous, and among them I saw the
Arsinoe Bulbul (Pycnovohis arsinoe), the Brown-necked Fire-Finch
(. Lago?iosticta senegala brnnneiccps), the Indigo Finch ( Hypochcera
riltraviarina) and the African Silver-bill Finch (Mania cantans).
There were very many Waxbills in the bushes, including the
Cordon Bleu which is very common here. The bush was alive
with the twitterings of the various species and the coos of pigeons

and doves. Among the latter I saw Sharpe's Turtle Dove ( Turtur
communis isabellinus), the Dongola Dove ( Turtur decipiens ) and
the Palm Dove ( lurtur senegalensis). Now and then I saw Pied
Crows ( Corvus scapulatus), and I caught sight of a Brown-necked
Raven ( Corvus coi&amp;apos;ax umbrimis). I spent some time watching
some Rollers ( Coracias gam-ulus&amp;apos;), and I also saw several specimens
of the Red-billed Hornbill ( Lophoceros erythrorhynchus), but these
were rather difficult to approach. During my walk I came across
the track of what was apparently a Leopard, but I did not catch
sight of any big game. Grivet Monkeys ( Cercopithecus ae/hiops)
were common, and kept up an incessant chattering in the trees.
There were some extremely large swarms of locusts here. Shortly
after sunset I returned to the boat, after one of the pleasantest
and most productive rambles I had had on this expedition. We
were unable to resume our journey this evening at the time
arranged, as some of our party, who had gone shooting, failed to
return ; we were somewhat anxious about them after dark, and
turned on every electric light on board and kept the whistle going
constantly. We were organising a search party when they turned
up ; they had lost their way at sunset--the sun going down very
quickly here--and had wandered about for some hours. They
were exceedingly glad to be back again on board and we started
immediately.
Feb. 21st. We are now back in the country of the Baggara
Arabs. We passed thejebelein hills and Abu Island, the scene
of the Mahdi's retirement for solitary meditation, this morning.
We went through the White Nile Bridge at five in the afternoon,
and later, stopped at Kosti, where we caught a large catfish,
weighing over twenty pounds ; its flesh was not very palatable.
Feb. 22nd. We passed El Dueim at four a.m. this morning,
and are now amongst desert scenery once again. The sand
comes down to the water's edge with Cacti and other desert
plants at intervals. There are a few trees at some distance from
the river ; I saw several fine mirages during the morning. Wild
fowl were very plentiful, and I noticed some Ruddy Shelduck
(Tadorna casarca), Pintails ( Anas acuta), Garganev ( Querquedula
circia) and Shovellers ( Spatula clypeata). Egyptian Vultures
\0x25A0were common, and I also saw a few Griffon Vultures ( Gyps

fulviis ), and here and there a Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Kites
and Crows were numerous. We landed in the afternoon at an
Arab village, and later, saw again the huge flocks of goats which
we noticed on our way south. Also we passed a large drove of
camels, probably numbering fifty or more, coming down to water.
We arrived at " Gordon's tree" and tied up there for the night.
Feb. 23rd. We landed at Khartum for breakfast. I spent
a couple of days in Khartum, making arrangements for the ship-
ment of my small collection of native curios to England, and
then started north again across Nubia bound for Luxor.
This concludes the narrative of my journey on the White
Nile. I may add that the diary was not kept with any view to
future publication, but, 011 showing it to some friends, they gave
it as their opinion that it might prove of general interest; I
have, therefore, given it just as it was written on board, exclud-
ing only those parts which had no bearing on natural history.

It might interest some of the readers of the Avicultural
Magazine to hear about my experience with Cranes in this cold
climate. We have had here at Wenliam, eight Demoiselle, two
Sams, two Manchurians, two Asiatic White, and two European
Cranes. The latter two species were only acquired in January,
1912.
I started by wintering Cranes in a barn, but was advised
by Mr. G. O. Tilley of Darien, Connecticut, to winter them out-
side. I took his advice in part, though our winters here are
much more severe than in Eastern Connecticut, and kept out
this winter without any shelter other than some small Aibor
vilces, two Asiatic Whites, two Demoiselles, and two Europeans.
The Sarus and the Manchurians were driven into a small
shed at night, but on the whole did not seem any the better for it.
The rest of the Demoiselles were wintered with other Water Fowl
in fairly comfortable quarters. One Sarus (Eastern race) died of
a general suppuration of the joints and tendons of the legs and
feet. He was lame for some time, and had I known what I know

now I should have placed him immediately in water or on damp
moss. The continual standing on hard frozen ground and ice
seems to be a bad thing for Cranes, though their feet do not
feeeze even at temperatures as low as i4*F.
One of the Asiatic Whites developed a bad foot, but the

advent of a couple of warmish days with wet ground immediately
cured it. The past winter has been the most extreme in a
decade. The mean January temperature for Boston was about
on a par with the lowest January mean ever recorded by the
weather bureau. The temperature recorded here from o Q to 14 0
on many consecutive nights. One day the thermometer was o*
at noon. As an instance of the hardihood of Cranes, one of my

Europeans jumped the fence the day after he arrived in January,
and not being oriented as to his new home, we could do nothing
with him. He escaped early on January 26th and travelled over
a large tract of country, but owing to heavy wind and drifting
snow we could not locate him. O11 the afternoon of the 29th he
came back, decoyed apparently by the calls of the Manchurians.
He was captured with some trouble and found to be none the
worse for his experience. He had weathered the blizzards of
snow, and during two of the three nights the thermometer was
well below zero. He got absolutely nothing to eat.
In Eastern Connecticut Mr. Tilley has wintered Sand-
Hills, Japanese White Necks, Sarus, Manchurian, Asiatic Whites,
Europeans, Demoiselles, and even a pair of the rare Hooded
Cranes (Grus vionachus&amp;apos;) without other shelter than a windbreak
of evergreens, but as before observed the climate is milder than
here. The Stanley and Crowned Cranes of Africa required, he
found, a good deal of shelter, though they were out in a yard
through the day.
Those interested in the Crane family will mourn the loss of
our splendid Whooping Crane, gone probably for ever. The last
published observation of this species that I know about was made
by Ferry (Azik, Vol. 27, p. 195) who noted an individual at Quill
Lake, Saskatchewan, July 14th, 1909. E. H. Seton, in his
book the " Arctic Priaries," on p. 287. noted five Whoopers flying
overhead on the Atliabaska River, October 16th, 1907. These are
perhaps the last that will ever be seen in the wild.

Mr. Sidney Williams.
The extinction of such a fine species is a real calamity and
one that will be realised by the next generation much more than
by this one. Our Sand Hill Crane is getting scarce, and I am
very much afraid he is a doomed bird unless special legislation
and large tracts of land are set aside for its benefit.
WEAVER BIRDS.
By Sidney Williams, F.Z.S.
Having been asked to write a few notes for our Magazine,
I have chosen the Weavers--which are great favourites of mine
--as my subject. At present I have kept the following species :
Red-billed ( Quelea quelea ), Orange Bishop (. Pyromelanafranciscana),
Napoleon Weaver (P. afra), Crimson Crowned (P. flammiceps).
Grenadier (P. orix), Madagascar ( Foudia via dag a sea rien s is ),
Yellowish Weaver ( Sitagra luteola) Rufous-necked ( Hyphantornis
cucullatus ), called sometimes by the dealers the Atlas Weaver,
Black-headed (//. vielanocephahis) and Baya Weaver ( Ploceus haya).
I have also two birds which have not come into colour and cannot
at present identify them. One, I think, is a Comoro Weaver
(Foudia eminentissima ), and the other is about the size of the
Rufous-neck, only black eyes instead of red. Body colour pale
greenish buff, showing small patches of brilliant yellow on breast
and throat. This bird I picked np for a shilling in a dealer's
shop in East London a few weeks back. Whenever I am down
that part, and it is usually once a week, I am always on the look
out for anything new in Weavers, and have more than once
picked up a bargain. It was during one of these visits that I
saw and bought the Black Bishop's Weaver, which I exhibited
at the Horticultural Hall in 1910. At the time I thought I had
discovered a new variety, but after discussing the bird with some
of our members who were present, we came to the conclusion
that it was only a melanistic form of P. francescana. After the
moult it could scarcely be told from the other Orange Bishop
which shared its cage ; and to my surprise, when it came into
colour last year, it assumed the normal orange and black colour,
thereby proving its identity. Why having once been abnormal
in colouring it reverted to the normal I cannot say, but I am told

by a dealer who visits Africa that he has seen them flying with
other birds of their kind occasionally in the wild state.
Looking through our magazine for the past few years I
find very little mentioned about these interesting birds ; it may
be they are not thought interesting enough to write about, or
perhaps it is having got a bad name for meddling with other
birds which are nesting (and I must admit no bird can be more
mischievous) they are not kept. It certainly is most annoying
to find a clutch of eggs ruthlessly pitched on the floor, in order
that Mr. Weaver can amuse himself with trying the material on
to everything within his reach, or building himself a nest and
usually stopping there, for very few Weavers I think have bred
in this country. Here is a chance to win a medal for someone.
Now if you can devote an aviary entirely to Weavers I do
not know of any birds more interesting. Most of them have, so
to speak, two changes of raiment, and to watch the transforma-
tion from dull huffish brown to brilliant oranges, scarlets, yellows
and blacks, which we see in the case of the Orange Bishop,
Madagascar Weaver, Napoleon and Black-headed Weaver, when
assuming breeding plumage, must make us stop and consider
how wonderful nature is. Although we find these brilliant
colours in the Weavers, they are very hardy birds and live to
a ripe old age in captivity. I will quote Dr. Butler's experience
of longevity among his birds: Black-headed lived 14 years,
Madagascar and Napoleon 12 years, Orange 10 years, Baya 8
years, Common 7 years, and a Red-billed 15 years. I think for
small cage birds this would take a lot of beating. Then as
regards the price, most of those I have mentioned can be
bought for 2/6 each, and very often cheaper when out of colour.
If you are within easy distance of some foreign bird dealer and
wish to keep a few find out when he is expecting a consignment
of African birds in, and if you are not well up in this species,
get a friend who is to go with you and look carefully through the
stock, usually for an outlay of a few shillings you can get two or
three kinds of Weavers; only take my advice and get them if
possible out of colour, for the pleasure of watching them come
into colour for the first time is never forgotten.
Their bill of fare is simple. Weavers require only Canary

seed, white millet and spray millet, and also relish a few meal-
worms and spiders. Mine are fond of green food such as chick-
weed, lettuce, etc., but I have heard all will not eat it.
If I were asked I should recommend anyone wishing to
start in the foreign cage bird fancy to try Weavers, for, as I have
pointed out, you have in them hardy, inexpensive, beautiful, and
interesting birds, and what more could be desired. Should any
of my readers at any time wish to procure any and are unable
to do so, being close to the London dealers and able to frequently
visit them I shall be only too delighted to get any specimens
they wish. To assist in adding another member to our ranks
is to me always a pleasure.

The arrivals for the past month have been few. Mr.
Meade-Waldo has presented a very fine male Ural Owl, which
had lived in his possession for no less than twenty-eight years.
The Society has only possessed three specimens previously.
Eight of the iaie Ruffed Lorikeets (Callipti/us solitarius)
from Fiji were temporarily deposited in the gardens, these and
the pair recently deposited by Dr. Balir being the only specimens
ever imported, so far as one knows.
In the King's Nepalese Collection the only birds of any
importance are a pair of Monaul Pheasants, two cock Cheer
Pheasants, a pair of Black-backed Kalij Pheasants and two males
of the rare Kokla or Wedge-tailed Fruit Pigeon, of which species
a coloured plate and a most interesting aiticle appeared in the
March number of this journal.
The White Storks succeeded in hatching no less than five
young birds, the first of which appeared nearly a week before
the last. All went well until the eldest was about ten days old,
when four of them died, one after the other. Dr. Plimmer, the
Society's Pathologist, made a post mortem examination and
reported that they had every appearance of having suffered from
gout, the body cavity being coated with uric acid crystals. They

were fed by the parents on chopped fish and small pieces of meat,
on which diet the surviving bird is growing enormously.
We have reated a brood of six Black-tailed Water Hens
[Tribonyx ventralis) using a bantam as a foster mother.
Waterfowl seem to be very backward with us this year, for
what reason I know not unless the dry weather has anything to do
with it. Very few of the Ducks are laying and I am afraid we
shall not have such a good season as we had last year. The
Upland Geese have produced a brood of six strong goslings, and
the Variegated Sheldrakes or New Zealand Paradise Ducks have
four young ones. P&amp;apos;ive Carolina Ducks, four Egyptian Geese
and the three Chestnut-breasted Teal, mentioned last month,
complete the list of Waterfowl up to the present.
The young Pheasants make a better show. We have quite
a number of Sonnerat's Jungle P&amp;apos;owls, also a brood of hybrids
between the distinct Javan Jungle Fowl and the Red Jungle
Fowl, three young Horned Tragopans, Swinhoe's Elliot's
Black-backed Kalij, Reeves and Golden Pheasants.

and some of the doves have young, but I shall hope to be able
to report more fully on this next month. D. S-S.

request, however, of the President, Canon Dutton, the date has
been altered and Friday , June 21 st has been decided upon.
Members are requested therefore to take notice that the reception,
followed by tea , will be held at 4 o&amp;apos; clock on that date 1In the Fellows&amp;apos;

THE MOCKING BIRD.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.990109731707317" page_id="32659358"  page_num="228" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I have kept Mocking Birds (North American) but have never
heard them mimic any sound the)&amp;apos; could hear. They throve well in an
aviary high enough to allow them to tumble in the air. I noticed one
curious fact with regard to their eyes, which varied in shade of colour,
some having dark brown eyes, others light vellow-grey. The birds with
the light coloured eyes were very ill-tempered and pugnacious and spiteful,
but not those with the dark eyes. It was easy to make friends with these,
but I never trusted the others. I have observed this with other birds also,
and have often wondered if it is the rule or the exception, and if others
have noticed it. My Mocking Birds warbled and ' chipped ' but I was
disappointed in their vocal powers. They were healthy enough and in
very good plumage. They had a grass plot to peck about on and a tree to
sit in. They loved bathing, and their soft grey and white plumage looked
exquisitely lovely after the toilet. I cannot say they were either especially
clever or capable of attachment. Probably they are both in their wild
state. Katharine Currey.
THE WEDGE-TAILED GREEN PIGEON.
Sir,--T he last two numbers of the Magazine have just followed me
home from India, so that the following remarks are somewhat belated.
Mr. Dodsworth's interesting article on Sphenocercus sphenurus calls
for several remarks. In the first place, I should say that Mr. Dodsworth is
quite correct in assuming that the description of his cage-bird and that of
Blyth's l/mago cantillans is merely that of the young bird. The Wedge-
tailed Green Pigeon takes at least two years and perhaps three to attain liis
full plumage, and this I have found to be the case with all the members of
the Treronince I have kept in captivity.
My birds of all species were very greedy feeders in captivity, eating
freely all grain, fruit and much green stuff also, as well as white ants or
termites. These they captured on the ground, running after them with
great speed as they fell after flight. All my birds also drank freely, settling
either on the ground or on the edge of the pan for this purpose.
I have seen wild birds drinking also, sometimes alighting on sand or
shingle alongside streams for this purpose, but more often clambering
down the cane brakes--in which they were settling down for the night--
until they could bend over and reach the water.
I have had many in confinement and can endorse all that Mr. Barnby
Smith says in his article on Satyra Tragopan in our April number. The
nuptial displays of Blyth's Tragopan are just as wonderful as those of the
Satyra, but when my birds were fully breeding the horns were always more
or less inflated and visible, though erected and fully inflated oidy during
the nuptial displays. E. C. Stuart Baker.

THE BLUE CHAFFINCH OF TENERIFFE.

<bodyText confidence="0.992930925" page_id="32659359"  page_num="229" year="" vol="">
Sir,-- Mr. Astiey's interesting account of the Teydeau Chaffinch in
the May number of the Avicnllural Magazine calls for some slight
correction. Fringilla teydea is entirely confined to the Pine Forest district of
Teneriffe. There is a closely allied race inhabiting the Pine region of Gran
Canaria, but it is very rare.
There is no possibility of F. teydea being found in Fuerteventura,
neither it, or any other Chaffinch conld possibly live there, as with the
exception of a few Date Palms there is no forest of timber. I know the
Islands intimately well, and am certain of it.
A full account of F. teydea as an aviary bird, with notes on its
breeding in own aviaries, appeared in Vol. I. of the Avicultural Magazine,
page 103 (1S95). E. G. B. Mkade-Wai.do.
SEXUAL DISPLAY.
SrR, -- I witnessed, to-day, a sight which struck me as being so
comical and curious as to be, possibly, worthy of record.
When in the flight of the Western Aviary at the Zoo, next to that in
which the Streaked Laughing Thrush f Trochalopterum l meat-urn ) is, I
observed him to be in full and active display. His feathers were all puffed
out in the "petticoat" form in which those of Lawes' Bird of Paradise are
in similar circumstances, and his short little wings were extended much in
the manner of those of the Greater Bird of Paradise when he shews off, and
he was pirouetting on the perch. I watched him at a distance of three or
four feet only, for fully half-a-minute, and .made myself absolutely certain
that the object of his attentions was -- the Long-billed Butcher-crow ( Baiita
destructor).
The Laughing Tliursh is a friend of comparatively long-standing and
always comes down to my hand, but so occupied was he on this occasion
that I had to wait some little time before he descended. When he did come,
however, instead of paying his usual attention to my mealworm, he faced his
love and continued his display from my finger.
O11 other occasions I have seen instances of misplaced affection
between birds, e.g. between a Rifle-bird and a Toucan, a Grey Struthidea and
a Black Hangnest, &amp;c. ; but a less promising flirtation than this I never
have observed.
Bailey, the keeper, to whom I told what had happened, suggested that
the bird had assumed a fighting attitude in connection with mealworms and
the donation of them to other birds; but I am convinced that the posture
was an amorous and not a combative one, because, not only had I not fed
any other bird within the Laughing Thrush's view, but, when I offered him
a mealworm he was indifferent to it. Arthur Denman.

<bodyText confidence="0.989827609756098" page_id="32659360"  page_num="230" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- I n reply to Mr. C. Bamby Smith's inquiries in last month's
Avicultural Magazine with regard to the nesting of the Knot, I gladly give
all the information at mv disposal in the hope that it may be the means of
someone being successful with them, but I fear that some, perhaps the most
essential points have escaped my memory, being such a long time ago since
w&amp;apos;e tried to get them to nest. I believe that it is well known bv a good many
how we treated them in the first place. Several pair were kept indoors
during the winter in a regular heat, I think it was 55 degrees; when the
warm weather came they were let out into a large aviary, 56 feet long, 46 feet
wide and 9 feet high, with a good deal of long grass, several Evergreen
bushes, a gravel path 4 feet wide all round and a stream of water in the
centre. The birds did very well during their confinement indoors, and
when let out, every one was in the best of health and in full breeding dress.
We fed them on minced fish, sheep's heart, soaked bread, Spratt's meal,
soaked or scalded lettuce, or any other tender greens, chopped finely and
all mixed together.
I believe that the cause of our failure in not getting them to nest
was that we neglected giving them some rough surroundings in the way of
boulders and retired corners here and there in the outer aviaty. Long grass
did not appeal to them as suitable nesting quarters, but on the other hand it
was very necessary for the birds ; they found it a happy hunting ground for
various insects of which they were expert catchers. In the early mornings
and late evenings the birds were always very restless flying round and round
the full extent of the aviary all the time calling loudly to each other; this
would go on for an hour or more at times. As autumn and spring came, they
were much more restless, beginning in the afternoons to utter their plantive
call and keep on the wing, more or less, until dark. During daylight I
never saw one hurt itself in any way, they would carefully avoid all obstacles
in the way, such as uprights or perches ; but at nights they were not so
fortunate, I have often picked one up in the morning with its head broken
through coming in contact with something during the night; they&amp;apos; long for
migration more than any bird I ever had charge of. The amount of exer-
cise thev take keeps them in good health, doubtless this accounts for their
long life in confinement, to keep their flight feathers cut, or pinion them
would, I think, be a mistake. Apart from those which were killed at night,
all the remainder of the flock died of old age, and I think it is curious that
as they&amp;apos; dropped off one by&amp;apos; one they were in full breeding plumage, and over
fat, the latter I attribute to want of exercise: I noticed particularly&amp;apos; that as
old age came along the birds did not crave for liberty and got lazy, hence
over-feeding and finally&amp;apos; heart disease and other maladies.

Sik,--T he extraordinary proceedings of an Owen's Apteryx (Apteryx
oweni), which formed part of the collection here will, I am sure, amuse a
good many. On April 4th last a Reeve's Pheasant made a nest under a fallen
hough of a thorn tree, where nettles and other rubbish grow.
When three eggs were deposited they were discovered by the Apteryx
during his nocturnal rumblings and immediately annexed by him. You can
imagine my surprise and anger when I found him on the nest, and thinking
it was a mere accident, or a slight fancy, I picked him up and removed him
more than 100 yards away, to his favourite hiding place. Next morning he
was again on the eggs, and I removed him once more, only to find him
back on the nest the following morning.
Since that he has sat on the eggs, in a most business-like way, only
that I think he is a strong believer in the " Shops Assistant Act! " having
taken three full days holiday during the time of his well-meaning industry.
The three eggs are of course useless, but we are going to give him three
good eggs just ready to hatch to see what happens.
&amp;apos;The Pheasant went away disgusted, and did not nest again for ten
days; by that time doubtless she forgot that a Moonlighter occupied the
same enclosure as she did.
The accompanying photograph shows the bird and its surroundings
much better than my feeble attempt to describe it.
For some years we have had nests disturbed at nights in this enclosure,
particularly Pheasants ; the eggs would be strewed about and the nest
likewise showing unmistakable signs of a severe struggle for possession. I
have suspected Oweni for this and now feel sure that I was right in doing
so. It is a great favourite and does so well in this enclosure, having been
entirely self-supporting for over twenty years. During severe winters I have
offered him food, but he would not touch it, his natural food is quite
plentiful during the greater patt of the year, and consists of worms and any
insect small enough to swallow whole.
Although strictly nocturnal it is quite surprising how accurately he
will find his way to one of his well known hiding places. When taken
from one of these places during daylight and placed on the ground twenty
yards or more away, he will remain motionless for a few seconds to take
his bearings and then start off at a great pace in a bee line for the place
that he had been taken from. To describe this " run " properly is far too
much for me. Roughly, its a double shuffle, dot and carry one sort of
gait. The head is carried low with the bill almost touching the ground,
always making use of the feelers with which he is well provided.

Major Horsbrugh, a well-known ornithologist and sports-
man and member of our Society, is to be heartily congratulated
on the first part, of his very practical book. It is obviously
written by one who knows the birds of which he writes, and by
condensing the description, distribution and synonymy into a
few concise lines he is able to tell us something of the habits,
food, method of approaching them from the sportman's point of
view, and what is perhaps of most interest to us, how&amp;apos; they should
be treated in captivity. The author is a keen aviculturist, and
even with species which he has not kept, his suggestions founded
on observations made in the field cannot but be most valuable
to those who may be fortunate enough to procure any of the
species mentioned. The coloured plates which accompany every
species, and of which sixteen are included in the present Part,
are most accurately and carefully done and well reproduced, so
that the wrong identification of any species should be an im-
possibility. Our only criticism of them is that the figures have
been drawn rather too large for the size of the page, and in some
cases, where both sexes are shown, the attitudes due to the
exigencies of space are rather awkward.
We can thoroughly recommend this book, which gives the
maximum knowledge about each species in the minimum of space.

from its interest to visitors this paper is of considerable scientific
value and brings to one's mind better perhaps than in any other
way the enormous multitude of birds that yearly on their migra-

either side with its barren deserts.

BRITISH BIRDS. *
The numbers under review contain numerous notes chiefly
of the occurrences of rare or local birds in different parts of
Great Britain. We might draw attention to many notes on the
immigration of the Little Auk during the past winter, and to the
recovery of ringed birds; with regard to these latter it is notice-
able that a large percentage are recaptured comparatively near
the place where they were originally rung. Mr. H. H. Joy con-
tributes a most interesting article on the ringing and recapture
in successive winters of Starlings. Among the more important
articles we may note one by Mr. W. H. Mullens on Thomas
Muffet, a 'Doctor in Physick,' who made a speciality of birds
from the gastronomic point of view; one on the Dipper, by Mr.
Arthur Brook, illustrated by some very nice photographs. Mr.
E. B. Dunlop also writes on the habit of some species to com-
mence incubation with the laying of the first egg.

XVI--BULBULS.
By Dr. A. G. Butler.
Although I have only had the pleasure of studying four,
or if we include the Spotted-wing (which certainly is an aberrant
Bulbul), five species of this delightful group of birds, I think
perhaps my experience in keeping them may not be valueless.
The Bulbuls f Pycnonotince) or Eastern Nightingales belong
to the so-called Babbling-Thrushes, and, on account of their
short legs, they have been placed in a family to which the name
Brachypodidce was given. In their strong hard bills and general
appearance they are rather Tit-like in character and the resem-
blance of the Indian form of Pyc?ionotus leucotis to Pains major
is quite as great as between many mimics among birds, the crest
of the Bulbul being the most obvious difference between the two.
As captive birds the Pycnonotince are extremely fascinating,
being naturally hardy, easy to provide for, generally of a con-
fiding nature, always musical, and in the case of the Persian
form of P. leucotis noted for melodious song, and I should judge,
provided that true sexes are secured, by no means difficult to
induce to breed in an aviary ; the behaviour of my Red-vented
Bulbul in trying to assume parental duties towards a nest of
young Blue-birds would seem to justify this conclusion.
Although Dr. Sharpe, in his Catalogue of Timeliine birds,
records no differences between the sexes of the Bulbuls beyond
size (and even then only in some of the species), although also
he frequently asserts that there is no difference in plumage, I
must confess that when one compares undoubted sexes of some
of the species side by side the difference in colouring seems to
me sufficiently marked to make one wonder how it could fail to
be noted : but, apart from colouring, the outline of the bill in the
two sexes differs so markedly that the would-be breeder ought
to have no difficulty in selecting sexes.
In choosing a pair the aviculturist should select as male
the larger bird with short robust bill, its culmen well arched,
that of the female being longer, more slender and with the
culmen only slightly arched ; the tone of the brown colouring
usually differs somewhat, and when the under tail-coverts are

rosy, the male has that colouring better defined, brighter and
covering a larger area ; I cannot say whether a similar difference
obtains in the yellow-vented species as I have not possessed
females for comparison.
The nests of Bulbuls are cup-shaped and usually are built
in bushes, creepers, low branches of trees or even upon stumps;
an aviary well furnished with foliage of various kinds would
therefore be most suitable for breeding purposes: although the
adults feed largely on fruit and, as compared with many insec-
tivorous birds, somewhat sparingly upon insects, it is probable
that the young in their early life would be fed upon insects alone
and chiefly insects in the larval stage.
If Bulbuls are desired for song alone, I should certainly
recommend the Persian form of the White-eared Bulbul, which
is deservedly noted in prose and poetry as a grand songster :
some of its water-bubble notes remind one strongly of the
European Nightingale ( Daulius luschiia) : the somewhat smaller
N.W. Indian form of the species is said not to sing anything like
so well, but as I have only kept the Persian bird, I cannot speak
authoritatively on this point; touching its smaller size, however,
I was convinced by the late Mr. Abrahams who sent me a body
of the Indian bird for comparison with my living example ;
indeed the difference was so palpable that I wondered at the
observation of the late Mr. Blanford that the Persian bird " may
perhaps run a little longer."
If kept in a cage the latter should be of a size large enough
to enable the bird both to use its wings freely and bathe at will.
Bulbuls are by nature tolerably active birds and they delight in
a bath ; they are when healthy scrupulously clean, and their
plumage, though soft in texture, is kept beautifully unsoiled :
with my Persian bird I made the mistake of confining it in too
small a cage, the latter was of the box variety one foot across the
front, 18 inches high and 18 inches from front to back with one
perch high up towards the back, and a second low down towards
the front: in a larger cage and with a greater amount of fruit to
eat I feel sure I should have been able to keep it for more than
five years, although perhaps it might have been less confiding
than it was. I have had my first male Chinese Bulbul for close
upon thirteen years already and it is still vigorous.

And this brings me to the question of food :--as a staple
any good insectivorous food mixed with breadcrumbs and moist-
ened is suitable, but Bulbuls are very fond of sweets and sponge-
cake either dry or moistened or Madeira cake delights them
greatly, candied fruit also and especially apricot, gives them
great pleasure. They ought to have plenty of fresh ripe fruit in
variety--banana, sweet ripe pear or apple, orange or ripe fig and
grapes, although they seem to care less for these than many other
insectivorous birds do and sometimes leave them untouched.
Insects are usually acceptable but especially smooth cater-
pillars, mealworms are also eaten with pleasure, but spiders
alone are able to arouse enthusiasm in these birds, sometimes
stimulating them to a song of rejoicing. Although most insects
are eaten with satisfaction (cockroaches are almost invariably
ignored), I do not find them a necessary item in the food for
adult Bulbuls; they will keep in perfect health for months to-
gether without them. Of course if a Bulbul gets in the least out
of sorts, a few spiders will generally set it right in a day or two.
These birds are very pugnacious; indeed, as Jerdon tells
us, the Madras Bulbul is kept for fighting by the natives in the
Carnatic, and he says :--" They fight sometimes with great spirit,
often, I am assured, seizing their antagonist by the red feathers,
and endeavouring to pull them out." I11 1904, our late Editor
Mr. Seth-Smith gave me a second example of the Chinese
Bulbul, which, from its stouter build and duller colouring, we
thought might be a hen ; I turned it into the flight-cage with
my cock bird and the latter at once attacked it furiously, so that
I was obliged to separate them immediately: both proved to be
cock birds and used to sing one against the other until I gave
the plumper bird away.
Whether Bulbuls would be dangerous associates for smaller
birds in an aviary I cannot say, but they are no match for such
birds as Hangnests, which pursue and attack them to their hurt.
In a large aviary, planted with trees, shrubs and creepers I
should expect them to behave peaceably towards all excepting
birds of their own kind, still it would be wiser to test them first
with a few small and common species before running the risk of
having valuable birds killed.

Part II.
(Concluded Jrom page 211J.
Now, in view of this large array of facts, we really ought
to be able to say something definite as to whether Darwin was
right or not; personally I do not think his case is proved, as far
as colour and decorations go,--at least that is my conclusion
after many years' observation of the habits of birds in general,
and their sex and social relations in particular. During my
experience, I have seen the following cases in favour of the
preference of a more highly decorated male or of a typical in-
stead of an abnormal specimen :--
I. A hen Avadavat (SporcEgintlms atnandava) twice chose a
bright-coloured cock in preference to a dull one sub-
mitted to her (different couples of males each time).
II. A hen Linnet ( Acant/us cannabina ) preferred a lame rich-
coloured male to a duller but stronger and perfect bird.
III. A hen Pekin Robin similarly preferred a weaker but
brilliant cock to a duller and stronger one.
IV. A female Spotted-billed Duck (Anas pcecilorhyncha) chose
as her mate a Mallard-coloured tame drake in preference
to Spotted-bills. Here of course we are dealing with
different species, but they interbreed freely when brought
together by man ; in nature their breeding-areas are
different.

<bodyText confidence="0.997134756756757" page_id="32659378"  page_num="238" year="" vol="">
distinctly preferred the handsomest drake in at least one
case.
VI. A hen Bird of Paradise ( Paradisea apodal) at the London
Zoo preferred a full-plmnaged cock to one in the young
plumage, though both showed off.
On the other side, I have seen :--
I. That on the London Park waters, Mallard drakes with
some aberration of colour (grey breast or reddish flanks)
get mates as readily as normal birds, and may have
mates when these cannot obtain them. The grey-
breasted birds are duller than the normal drake.
II. Among a mixed lot of poultry, bantam hens preferred a
half-Spanish cock, nearly all black and much too large,
to bantam cocks, and to a beautiful medium-sized cock
coloured just like the Jungle-fowl (i.e. a black-red).
III. In the London Zoo, a hen of the Common Peafowl (yar.
nigripeunis ) fell in love with a male Javan Peacock
(.Pavo muticus) neglecting a Common Peacock confined
with her. Here again we have a case of inter-species
mating, but the species do not meet in nature.
IV. Also in the Zoo, a female domestic Muscovy Duck pre-
ferred, of two of her brothers confined with her, one
marked with white about the head to a typical black-
headed one. It is true the white-headed one was the
stronger, and gave the other no chance, but after his
removal the duck would have nothing to do with the
other, but wanted to get to a Spur-winged Gander
(.Plectropterus gambensis) next door.
V. Another Zoo case was that of two male Red-breasted
Mergansers ( Merganser serrator ), of which the smaller,
duller, and less-well-marked bird got the female; here
again the bird which was less typical was the stronger--
he drove his rival ashore and would not let him go near
the female. But she, though she showed no special
attachment to him, did not show any sympathy with
the beaten bird by keeping company with him, although
a female bird does sometimes try to do this.

It will thus be seen that I cannot give any very conclusive
evidence in favour of orthodox female preferences ; but an ex-
tended series of experiments might show a very different result,
and confirm Darwin&amp;apos;s view. Anyone wishing to make such
should guard against the males getting at each other and fight-
ing, by confining the female used and the two rival cocks in
compartments separated by wire-netting with the hen's in the
centre ; it would also be best to get hens which were strangers
to the cocks, and to refer several pairs of cocks to the same hen,
as well as trying these couples of cocks with different hens in
succession.
If a series of such experiments showed that the hens on
the whole preferred the more highly-decorated males, or normal
males to those with more striking but abnormal colouration, the
only obstacle to the acceptance of Darwin's theory would be the
undoubted fact that strength counts for so much. But there is
nothing to prevent the hen migrating along with a beaten bird,
and perhaps the winner might not care to follow him away from
his own 41 beat."
I do not think the apparent indifference of the hen is a
very serious objection ; it has been pointed out that, from the
lateral position of most birds' eyes, they are able to observe
things even when they seem to be looking elsewhere, and so the
hen may be observing more than we think.
Moreover, many of us have noticed the similarity between
the bird mind and that of human children ; now, anyone who is
fond of noticing small children will have observed this, though
the little ones on first introduction to one who is fond of them
may not take apparent notice of friendly overtures, their
remarks to their parents afterwards, when the stranger has gone,
show that they did notice and appreciate them. If hen birds
are like this, it is quite possible that here is another explanation
of apparent indifference to display.
For all that, however, I am quite convinced that the
display, like human blushing (and we all know that some birds
blush, the turkey especially ! ) is simply, as I said many years
ago, an instinctive expression of emotion ; birds would display
anyhow, whatever the result.

Mr. Frank Finn,
If, moreover, the display does not please the hen, it comes
in very handy for " bluffing " adversaries; only the other day I
watched with much interest a black and a white swan displaying
vigorously to each other, obviously wishing to fight, but each too
afraid of the other to come to blows. I have seen a Mandarin
successfully bluff the much larger Dusky Duck (Anas obscura)
by display, and another try on the same game with a Carolina ;
in this case, however, the Mandarin met his match, for the
American bluffed in his turn, and the Chinaman gave way.*
The same principle of bluff may tell with the hen, for hen
birds are rather apt to be too independent, and to fail to respect
a male whom they do not fear a little. In fact, the display as a
bluff would justify its existence quite as much as if used as an
attraction ; and if this is the real use of it, it is easier to under-
stand why the attitudes of displaying birds are generally more
grotesque than beautiful--the displayer often looks as if he were
badly stuffed for the ornamentation of a lady's hat or a fire-place 1
However, as I have said above, there is no reason to suppose that
birds have what we call refinement or good taste, so we should
be careful in imputing to them aesthetic motives like our own.
Personal preference they do show, but we ourselves cannot
always rationally account for our preferences, so we may expect
to wait a while before we can fathom those of birds.
Voice, however, appears more potent than colour, for
colour- varieties of the same species, and species with very
different colours but the same note, such as the Mallard and
its dull allies, and the Hooded and Carrion Crows (Corvus comix
and C. corone ) interbreed with perfect freedom when brought
together, by man in the first place and naturally in the second.
If also, we consider what happens with our domestic birds,
even when allowed to breed indiscriminately without selection
by us, we shall see that there is a strong latent tendency to
increase in conspicuousness in colour, and to the production of
structural decorations, in most species.
Thus, most of them display a tendency to produce white
or pied plumage ; the " soft parts" often assume brighter colours,
* The Carolina&amp;apos;s display is a very poor affair : he only slightly raises his tail and
flattens his crest, diminishing his decoration instead of enhancing it; this is a very rare
case, but I have noticed also that Bulbuls displaying flatten instead of raising' their crests.

e.g . the guinea-fowl's feet tend to become orange instead of black,
and the Muscovy drake's face, naturally mostly black, becomes
more, or altogether, red.
Structural decorations may appear, like the knob on the
beak of the Chinese Goose (Cygnopsis cygnoides&amp;apos;) which is often
orange, contrasting with the normal black of the bill, and
common ducks and pigeons assume crests.
Sometimes these alterations are sex-limited, e.g. cinnamon
in canaries and blue in budgerigars, tend to be female colours,
while white in common geese tends to be a male colour.
We can see, then, that even without selection decorative
plumage and appendages, &amp;c. tends to appear; it is true that
such peculiarities are irregular, not constant as in wild species,
but in the latter natural selection may come into play to limit
variation. For instance, white feathers are usually soft, and so
we find few birds are all white or have even white quills, easily-
abraded quills being a dangerous possession for a wild bird. It
is particularly noticeable that in the only wild bird which varies
widely like an unselected domestic one--the Ruff (.Pavoncella
pugnax ) the variation (except in the rare white-necked variety)
is confined to the breeding season, and the Ruff, to be able to
carry his cumbrous decorations at all, must surely be able to defy
natural selection on his breeding-grounds at any rate.
If decorations are the result of the withdrawal of the
pressure of some form of natural selection we can see why they
are so often concealed in repose ; so long as a bird has the
tips of the quills, for instance, dark and tough, the concealed
part may be of any colour that variation gives, provided that
colour is correlated with a strong constitution--for no character
can escape constitutional selection, but must always go along
with power of resistance to climate, a good digestion, or what
not.
The nine-days-wonder of a grey thoroughbred winning
the Derby this year shows how important is the principle of
correlation, for if grey horses had high speed u 7 e should hear more
about their doings. I think myself that the force of variation,

THE LINNET AS A SONGSTER.
By David Bentley.
Of all the British hardbills I have kept, the Linnet in my
opinion takes the lead for song. Here, in Lancashire, where
singing contests take place for quality singing, you will find
some of the best birds. In Blackburn there is a Linnet Society
with a large number of members, and during the season many
singing competitions are held ; some of the open contests being
attended by fanciers from Wigan, Leeds, Chester and other
distant places.
Good birds are very scarce, and are, therefore, very valu-
able, both as schoolmasters for young birds and also as contest
singers. One fact worth noticing is that the older a good bird
gets the better he sings. One of the best Linnets in this district
was still in grand form when thirteen years old, and a good
price was refused for it then. Another I knew was twenty-five
years old, and is still taking part in singing contests. My present
favourite has been caged over seven years and is still in the best
of health and song.
Preference is given here by Linnet keepers to birds caught
in the Fylde District and round about Lancaster, and I must
say that I have never been able to get any better bird for song
from any other part of England.
Linnets in captivity do not often take up the notes of
other species, but are quick to learn from one another, and so
good birds must be kept away from inferior ones or their song
would soon depreciate, although, if good ones only are kept
together, there is a chance of their improving each other, and

young Linnets trained under a good schoolmaster often turn
out first-class songsters.
Although singing is one of the principal reasons why so
many Linnets are kept here, good feather and fine condition are
also well looked after, and I have seen many a first-class songster
take a premier prize at Bird Exhibitions, and when I have my-
self wanted an exhibition Linnet, I have often been able to get
what I required amongst our members, for many of them keep
their birds on what is called " Wild Seed." This is a mixture of
wild seeds that used to come from the farmers in the Fylde dis-
trict, but is now supplied by Mr. J. Walsh, Naturalist, Blackburn,
and for bringing out the nut-brown colour in Linnets I do not
know any other food equal to it.
This wild seed is also very useful in getting these birds
into breeding condition. Many of the members of our Society
have never kept any other birds but Linnets, and have made a
life study of them, a few for over 50 years. Some of their ideas
are no doubt crude, and would sound strange to our up-to-date
fanciers, but they are the result of years of experience. I11 their
musical abilities, Linnets vary as much as human beings (they
all sing more or less), but it is not every day we come across a
champion, so I find it best when you get hold of a good bird
to keep it. Although I have kept over fifty varieties of British
birds, I may say I have derived more satisfaction and enjoyment
from the Linnet as a song bird than from any other species.

Spathopterus alexandrce.
By Hubert D. Astley.
Last year I had the great disappointment of losing the
one young Queen Alexandra that was hatched, owing to a
murderous onslaught from a male Stanley Parrakeet, at least I
suspected him, though the case was ' non-proven.' This year
I hope I have been very much more successful.
In April all three pairs were nesting, and one hen laid at
least ten eggs, but not in a desirable nesting-box, so that the
eggs were rolled about, some were cracked, and the rest did not

Mr. Hubert D. Astley,
hatch out, for the bird was fidgety. This was what I call Pair
No. 3. They are now nesting again (3rd of June).
Pair No. 2 were also unsuccessful, for the hen chose too
deep a box, and consequently jumped down on to the eggs, broke
one or two--she had five--and the yolk stuck to her feathers,
so that the other eggs were spoilt. She is now nesting again.
Pair No. 1. Well ! Bravo Pair No. I! ! They selected
what I am convinced is the most desirable form of nesting-box
for parrakeets, which I have made at home. Two feet long, with
a wooden cup let into the floor of the box at the farthest end
from the entrance hole, which is at one side. The box is hung
horizontally, that is lengthways on the wall, and the parrakeets
can walk in and settle quietly on their eggs, feeling secure in the
dark corner where the depression is made. A nice handful or
two of rotten wood is put in, and on this the eggs are laid. The
wooden cup is below the level of the floor, and at the other end a
door is made, so that if necessary one can look in, besides which
it facilitates cleaning out the box when the young have flown.
Well ! Pair No. 1 took possession of such a box, which was
one hung in a dark corner of a roosting house, about ten feet up
on the wall. The hen laid her eggs in April, and as with Nos.
2 and 3, the male was constantly seen to feed her and to mate;
the feeding always taking place first.
In the beginning of May the hen kept so closely on her
eggs that I began to wonder whether she was alive, so quiet and
silent was everything within ; which terrible thought impelled
me to mount a ladder to look in the box. As I did so, out she
scurried, looking as fresh as paint. As I was up, I thought I
would have a peep, opened the door, and there at the farther end,
lying in the nest of rotten wood-chips, which had been bitten up
very finely, were seven eggs. I hurried down and left the birds
to their own arrangements. On the 12th of May, young ones
were heard making their scraping raucous call when they were
fed, and the male bird took to going into the nest as well as his
wife. The noise of the young ones might have been produced
by at least five, so that I was full of great hopes.
The male is extraordinarily tame, and directly I go in to
his apartment, he settles either on one of my arms, or shoulders,

or my head, and will devour mealworms, biting off their heads
and squeezing out their insides! Then he chucks away the skin
and greedily demands another.
On one of the last days in May, I again looked in, as the
hen bird hardly ever appeared, and to my joy found two fine
young birds, although I was a little disappointed that five of the
eggs were unhatched. However, the two were really very fine
and large, and completely feathered, looking like their mother in
colour, but more washed out.
On the 3rd of June, the old birds were again seen in the
act of mating, and the hen began to throw some of the refuse out
of the nesting-box, so that I deemed it advisable to remove the
young birds, which were still unable to fly, to a big open box
with an inch of sawdust at the bottom, and put them quite low
down, so that they would not be injured by falling, for I had
visions of their being turned out by their mother and tumbling
down ten feet 011 to a hard cement floor. When I took the
young ones out, the male bird fussed round in a great stew, so
that I felt confident that lie would continue to feed them, although
they would not be so very long before they fed themselves.
The parent birds have had an abundance of fresh grass
seeds, dandelion leaves, etc , as well as gentles and biscuit sop,
and if they are as proud of their young ones as I am, they must
be very cock-a-hoop birds indeed ! I have striven for nine years
to breed these beautiful Parrakeets (Rose-throated Parrakeets as
I like to call them !) and I hope I have at last succeeded.
If these young ones reach full maturity, they will be the
first to do so outside Australia, as far as I know, but I do not
think there is much doubt about it.

The two nestlings left the box on the 6th of June, when
they were probably nearly five weeks old. They can now feed
off biscuit sop when it is held in front of them (9th June).
Their colouring resembles the adult female, except that
the forehead is a mauve pink instead of pale blue, and the
ceres are pale yellow. The rose-coloured throats are quite as
brilliant as in the adult bird.
The parents are busy preparing for a second brood.

Mr. Reginald Phillipps.
On the 12th of June I removed the young birds to a cage
in the house; as it was evident that, although they did not yet
crack seeds, they could eat by themselves. For two days they
were rather shy ; but when hungry, would greedily devour
biscuit sop from a spoon. By the 15th they were quite tame,
and when let out of the cage would fly about the room, or
perch on my hand, rapidly fluttering their wings for exercise,
calling loudly at the same time.
One of them, if I offered him sop when he did not want it,
would impulsively peck at my hand, plainly saying ''take the
stuff away." If they had been hatched in a wild state, they
could not be better grown or more robust.

THE NAKED-THROATED BELL-BIRD--
AND HIS BATTLES.

At page 191 of our May number, Mr. Harding refers to
the untimely decease of his Naked-throated Bell-Bird. If my
experiences are worth anything, the species is an easy one to
keep in health so long as it is protected from the weather; should
it, however, be subjected to the Fresh Air Treatment, which has
been responsible for the death of not a few rare birds during
recent years, it will assuredly betake itself off. In 1888, when I
was more accustomed to British than to foreign birds, I received
two examples--and each came to an untimely end through an
overdose of fresh air.
My first was an adult male--white tinged with yellow. I
suppose this yellow tinge, not very infrequent with Bell-Birds
generally, is merely a stain? or is it a sign of age?
My second specimen, an immature male still in the green
feather when received, arrived a month later. All through the
summers of 1889 and 1890, sitting on a high bare perch in my
garden aviary, this " Smith" (as he is called by some in his own
country) lustily hammered away on his anvil each year until he
fell into moult (August). And here I shall do well, I think, to
exploit my wisdom, even at the cost of betraying my weakness,

by quoting Mr. Harding, as his language is more temperate than
any I feel disposed to use on so sore a subject : --"The voice of
this bird .... was as music in my ears, but my neighbours took
a less romantic view and heartily welcomed its untimely demise."
He lived with me for over twenty-six months, but in 1890 was
left out in the garden until too late in the season, caught a chill,
and expired before the close of the year. Both died oj pulmonary
consumption from over exposure.
Not in any book of travels or natural history have I ever
found a reference to the manner in which this species, and per-
haps the genus, conducts its battles ; and as it would be a sore
loss to mankind were the treasured secret to go down into the
grave with me, I will now divulge it, so that our Minister for
War, even at this the eleventh hour, may know how to teach
Young England how to fight.
No. 2, when received, was placed in a roomy six-foot-long
cage, with a perch running down the centre from end to end,
along with the first arrival. The birds took up their positions at
opposite ends of the cage, and soon let it be known, both by
voice and gesture, that neither was pleased at the presence of
the other; but as each persistently turned his back upon the
intruder--just to shew his contempt for the fellow, and as for the
most part a clear space of nearly three feet was kept between the
rival camps, their swellings and threatenings, although ostensibly
very alarming, did not seem likely to result in broken bones ; so
I disregarded the warnings of impending disaster--and had to
pay the penalty, as one so often has to when ignorance prevails.
In military tactics, a " strategical movement to the rear,"
although privately recognised, is publicly frowned upon ; all the
same, with Bell-Birds, a three-quarters movement to the rear
seems to be the usual order of attack.
Moving simultaneously backwards, very slowly it must be
admitted, from either end of the cage along the central perch,
inch by inch, with many blusterings and blowings, bowings and
scrapings, tail opposed to tail, and with heads as far removed
from the danger zone as circumstances permitted, each with face
slightly turned and with a wary wicked eye like to that of a
kicking horse, they would near to within some eighteen inches

of one another, when one--with a horrible YOWL which nearly
scraped the hair off one's head, and adequately accounts for the
absence of feathers on the throat of the species--would bound
into the air and endeavour to come down on to the head or neck
of his antagonist. But nothing came or seemed likely to come
of all these yowlings and circus-jumpings, and space was scarce,
so I still left them together ;--and one day I found the old warrior
in a heap on the floor of the cage in a state of collapse, with his
white robe soiled and blood-stained. The young bird had at
length succeeded in getting a blow in, and had inflicted not a
trivial scratch but a really serious cut across the back of the head,
at the base of the skull. Their movements at the climax were
so rapid as to render it difficult to detect whether they struck
with claws or beak, but I think that a side-cut with the sharp-
pointed beak must have caused the wound.

I must start by apologising for this very feeble attempt to
write about a small structure which I got my man to erect in our
garden, where, I am sorry to say, space is rather limited ; but
the following notes, written round the photograph, may I hope
help others like myself, unexperienced amateurs, to erect or get

mice out.
I have a great belief in making some sort of a drawing
to work from ; this is quite an easy matter, as it does not require
any art, only common sense and ruled lines. The first thing to
do is to measure your ground to see what size of an aviary you
can put down ; you will have to remember that your aviary will
look ever so much larger in reality than on paper. So now sup-
pose you have measured your ground and decided what size your
inside part is to be and what size your flight. You will then be
able to draw your ground-plan, after which you should draw an
elevation or front view and then an end view. A tradesman will

be able to work from these drawings so that little time may be
wasted, which means a saving to your pocket.
I first constructed my house, which is the covered part ;
it measures 6ft. from back to front, is 4ft. wide and 7ft. height
at back and 6ft. at front. In front I left space for a window,
which is fas you will see from the photo.) about 2ft. by ift. 6iu.
This house was constructed of gin. by gin. posts with gin. by
iiin. cross bars and covered with Jin. tongned and grooved
sheeting.
When the house w 7 as nearly finished I set it down firmly
in its place, on a good bed of clinkers from the greenhouse
furnace, then added more clinkers, made and laid down a thick
cement floor. I also put cement round the outside to keep water
and vermin from getting in. At the side of this house I left
space for a door leading into the flight, which is clearly seen in
the photo, also a small hole for the birds to get in and out
during the winter, when I keep the door shut.
By this time you will be ready to start the flight, which I
made 12ft. long by 6ft. deep, 6ft. high in front and 7ft. high at
back. This w r as made of gin. by gin. posts tarred and driven
firmly into the ground, the cross pieces and rafters are all gin.
by i#in. I covered the roof four feet over the flight up to the
middle post, thus giving a good outside shelter on wet and
stormy days. I also carried a roof along the back of the open
part, but only 14m. deep, to protect nesting-boxes, etc. The
back was made of Jin. tongued and grooved sheeting. All roofs
and outside of house were covered with roofing felt and w ? ell
tarred.
The floor of the flight was made of clinkers well hammered
down, then covered with cement, having a fall towards the front
of a few inches, so as to allow of the water running off, it also
makes cleaning very much easier.
I now covered the flight wdth half-inch wire netting, and I
must here mention an idea w^hich I put into practice and found
most useful in preserving the wdre, for I noticed that the netting
in our Tennis Club just lasted about three years, when it would
be pretty well rusted away in spite of the galvanizing, I thought
I would try varnishing, so I got some fairly good quick-drying

varnish and a big brush and went carefully over the netting;
in a few hours' time there was a good coating of hard varnish
all over, which most effectually kept the water from rusting
the wire, and I find after five years the netting as strong as ever.
Painting was the next item on the programme. I heard
that Distemper was the correct thing for an aviary, so I tried it,
but not for long, worse stuff I never used, it washed off with the
rain and rubbed off on one's clothes, so that I took to paint, in
fear and trembling that the birds would eat it and die of lead
poisoning, but they never looked at it and I have used paint
ever since ; it looks clean and is very easily renewed. For the
inside I use white and the outside dark-green, which stands well.
I must say a few words about the arrangement I put up for
holding seed hoppers; this, as you can see from the photo, is
simply a box let into the house part with a door through to the
front of the house so that it can be cleaned and new seed put in
the hoppers from the outside without disturbing the birds in the
flight, I put up a small piece in front of the box to keep the seed
from falling on the floor of the flight, and above the door you
will see I fastened a piece of rubber to keep the rain from work-
ing into the seed-box.
For water, I use white enamel dishes, which last well and
keep the water clean and fresh. I always found that pottery
ones grew a sort of green scum.
I have a big wooden tray for sand and broken up old
mortar, which the birds seem to love and they are never tired
picking amongst it; this I keep in the flight under the roof, so
that it is well protected from rain.
My first year I started with four pairs of Green Budgerigars
which multiplied tremendously ; that season I think I had to
dispose of between fifty or sixty young birds. They are a first-
rate species to start on, as one does not get disappointed at the
beginning --disappointments and deaths with come quite soon
enough later on with other species.
I now have an addition to my aviary at the other end, in
which I have a pair of Californian Quails. Last season they laid
about forty eggs but would not take the trouble to sit, I am afraid
they are just going to do the same this season too.

much to have an aviary like the Western Aviary at the Zoological

In the new Summer Aviary the birds have so far nested
well. Tinamous, both Rufous and Martineta, have laid very
freely and we have several young birds. We have taken the
first clutches of eggs and are rearing the chicks tinder hens.
They require a considerable amount of animal food, but seem
easy enough to rear in this way. They resemble their parents
very closely when quite young, the young Martinetas having a
very well developed crest on the head. The eggs are most
beautiful objects with a surface like glazed china, those of the
Rufous Tinamou being a rich chocolate colour, while those of
the Martineta are grass green.
Bronze-winged Pigeons have reared one young one and
are sitting again, while a pair of White-fronted Jamaican Doves
have reared a fine pair of young birds. A pair of South American
Scaly Doves are sitting.
The most important event in this aviary, however, is
the nesting of the Himalayan White-throated Ground Thrushes
(Geocichla cyanonotus&amp;apos;). The nest, much like that of a Blackbird,
built of hay and roots, was placed in a privet-bush about four
feet from the ground. Two eggs, also very much like those of a
Blackbird, were laid, the young being hatched and successfully
reared. When they left the nest they were dark brown in colour

but showed some grey on the back, and orange-coloured tips to
the breast-feathers. Moreover, the brown and white streaks on
the cheeks, so conspicuous a feature of the adults, is visible in
the young. The old birds have repaired the nest and laid two
more eggs. Grey-winged Ouzels have reared two young birds,
and Scarlet Tanagers have two strong young ones in a nest on
the ground amongst the long grass.
Californian Quails have laid and we have hatched half-a-
dozen chicks under a hen, which so far appear to be thriving
well.
In the Eastern Aviary, a young Brazilian Cariama, hatched
on June 21st, is doing well. Two young birds were hatched,
but the second was found dead in the nest the day after hatch-
ing. It will be remembered that we reared one young bird
from the same pair of Cariamas last summer.
From our stock of North American Wild Turkeys, the
four hens of which were reared here last year, we have had a
good number of eggs this year. We sold over fort}&amp;apos; and retained
a few, from which we have hatched twelve chicks, quite enough
to rear on our limited space.
I was hoping we might this year have bred the rare
Orinoco Goose, of which we have two males and one female,
but the pair have not nested. The odd male was paired to a
female Egyptian Goose, which laid two eggs but would not sit.
These two eggs were put into an incubator, and one hatched
and was given in charge of a Silkie hen which is rearing the
little gosling well. It is much like a young Sheldrake at present,
and it will be interesting to see how it turns out. The Egyptian
Goose has just started to lay again.
From eggs very kindly sent us by a Fellow of the Zoo-
logical Society we have hatched fourteen young Tufted Ducks*
which are growing well and spending most of their time diving
for food in one of the small ponds.
The most important arrivals for the month are contained
in the collection presented by the Government of the Federated
Malay States. Some rare Pheasants have come--a pair of Argus,
two pairs of Rufous-tailed Firebacks ( A counts erythrophthalmus ),

notes on the sun-bittern.
Sir,--May I be pardoned for exposing further ignorance and for
asking the following question?
Is it usual for birds to try to remedy defects in the condition of
their beaks by the means which I, to-day, observed the Sun-bittern in
the Western Aviary of the Zoo to be employing ?
The nether mandible has, apparently, received some slight injury,
and the upper one protrudes about a quarter-of-an-incli more than it ought
to. Eurypyga lielias was squatted down in the front of the flight and
was pushing his beak backwards and forwards along the metal ledge, at
an angle which just prevented contact between the lower mandible and
its surface. Having done this for some considerable time, he scraped the
point of his beak in the gravel, in an almost vertical position ; and these
movements he continued, alternately, for quite six or eight minutes after
my advent.
The ledge, being of iron, is so smooth that very little, if any, success
can attend the one effort; the gravel being soft, but little can follow from
the other : and so it is probable that others will have noticed repetition of
this very intelligent attempt on the part of a very strange bird to "strop"
his beak back into shape. What I should like to know is, whether his
method is one which is recognised. Arthur Denman.

FAMILIAR INDIAN BIRDS. *
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.939007" page_id="32659397"  page_num="255" year="" vol="">
That this little work now appears in its second edition is
evidence that the first has been appreciated by the Indian public;
it deals with a number of the familiar species of the country, and
contains a certain amount of original observation. The selection
of species is not always of the most judicious, and the treatment
rather uneven ; it seems, for instance, in a book for beginners,
rather unnecessary to go into details about the different species
of Terns in a work in which the very common Red-vented
Bulbul and House - Mynah, though dealt with, are not even
described. The Sparrow is not honoured with a notice, though
mentioned casually, and the common Kingfisher finds no place ;
yet local races of these two well-known British birds, one so
despised and the other so admired, are certainly familiar birds
in India. That they are well-known here too can hardly be the
author's reason for slighting them, because he gives full notices
of the common Coot and Moorhen, without descriptions, though
a friend of his mistook Moorhens for ducks, which looks as
if description were necessary !
The book, though interesting, as most books 011 Indian
birds are at present when so comparatively little has been written
popularly on the most interesting avifauna in the world, is, as a
matter of fact, distinctly slipshod in treatment; nor are the refer-
ences to authorities indented upon so full as might be fairly
desired. F. F.
THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS, f
When we consider that Flight is one of the main attributes
of birds, and the one to which their whole structure has been co-
ordinated, it is perhaps strange that ornithologists have very
largely neglected to study the method by which they are able

to accomplish their aerial evolutions. In the work before us,
Mr. Headley has attempted, and very successfully, to supply this
deficiency, and throughout the book he has avoided as far as
possible the deep mathematical and dynamic problems which
underlie the subject, and has expressed in clear and straight-
forward language the methods by which flight is accomplished.
The bird, as he points out, must be considered as a highly
efficient aeroplane, and the difficulties which Nature has had to
overcome are precisely those which are at the present day con-
fronting the human aviator. By a careful study, therefore, of a
bird's methods and structure the airman can most surely discover
the problems that he himself has to face, though in all, save the
essentials he will have to overcome them by different methods.
Mr. Headley has borne this fact in mind and has arranged his
book accordingly; the first three Chapters deal with Gliding,
Stability and Motive Power, after which follow chapters on
Starting, Steering and Stopping. The latter half of the book
treats of the subject rather from the bird than the airman's stand-
point, and we have notes on the Structure of Birds, Varieties of
Wing, Rate and Duration of Flight, and finally the very important
effect of Wind and the various ways by which it is turned to
account. In a book so excellent of its kind there is but little
to find fault with, and our criticisms, such as they are, are mostly
matters of opinion. We cannot for instance agree with the
author when he claims that the relative shortness of leg among
the larger birds has probably been a factor in keeping birds, as
compared with mammals, comparatively small. The Flamingo,
a typical long-legged bird, rises from the ground with difficulty,
while several non-fliers have long legs. Our idea roughly has
always been that the power (muscles) required to raise a large
bird must of necessity be so large (i.e. heavy) that a limit of size
is soon reached, and to our mind a proof of this lies in the fact
that the largest birds, e.g. Ostriches, Rheas, etc. are flightless.
Helmholtz formulated this idea, and Mr. Headley, without in
our opinion sufficient reason, rejects it. With regard to the
Velocity of Flight, Mr. Headley is cautious, and at the most
allows an imaided flight (i.e. unaided by wind) of about 50-60
miles per hour, though he gives the record of a Swallow that

maintained an average pace of 106 miles an hour for 160 miles.
As to the power of duration, a continuous flight of between 16
or 17 hours is quoted, but here again the author implies that this
would be exceptional. We know, however, that in the ' Tippler '
a breed of Pigeons, the record flight for old birds is over iS hours
and for young birds nearly 16 hours, and in the former case they
were called down at dusk and did not stop from exhaustion.
These points, however, are merely matters of opinion, and the
author is probably wise in keeping well within the mark.
The book is so moderate in price and contains such a
wealth of new matter that it should have a ready sale amongst
the public, airmen and ornithologists.
BRITISH WARBLERS. *
Mr. Howard has made himself master of the habits, more
especially during the courting season, of one of our most in-
teresting groups of birds, and the results of the small habits and
actions so carefully recorded, form a foundation 011 which more
generalised work in the future may follow. The habits and
courting measures of birds have been much neglected by the
orthodox ornithologist, and yet, in the bird's economy and in the
evolution of the different species, they must have played a part
as important, if not more essential, than the various differences
of form and colour. The book is carefully and well written and
forms most interesting reading for bird-lovers as well as for those
who take ornithology more seriously. The species dealt with in
this part are the Willow, Savi's and Rufous Warblers. We have
nothing but praise for Mr. Gronvold's plates, the actions and
positions being taken from the author's sketches. They are
unique in the positions they illustrate, but to anyone who knows
his birds they a&amp;gt;e obviously truthful.

A HANDLIST OF BRITISH BIRDS. *
The numbers of rare stragglers recorded from our shores
has, owing to the attention given to the subject by many col-
lectors and ornithologists, increased so considerably of late years
that we welcome with pleasure Messrs. Witherby's List, which
brings all these scattered records together ; it also, as the authors
belong to the latest and most advanced class of systematists,
includes under a different heading all the different races of the
same species, which have occurred in our islauds. From these
two points of view alone, this little volume will prove most
useful and acceptable to British Ornithologists generally. We
may not individually all agree as to the merits of certain races
to subspecific rank, but no one will deny the advantage of having
these various races clearly set out in a List like the present, our
only regret being that the distinguishing characters of the
different races are not given as well. We are quite aware that
this book is intended only as a List, but as space is found for
Distributional and Migrational notes a couple of lines giving
the main characteristics of the different subspecies would have
rendered the book still more complete and useful. The notes
on the Distribution, both in the British Isles and Abroad, as
well as the Migration notes, are extremely well and concisely
written.
This book, however, was mainly written witli a view of
advertising and popularising the names, many of them new, that
should be borne by our native birds under the new international
Code, to criticise these names in detail in our journal would be
out of place, but we must say that some of the names appear to
us to have been needlessly changed, while the alteration of
others, such as the transference of the name iliacus from the
Redwing to the Thrush, and musicus from the Thrush to the
Redwing is likely to lead to confusion rather than to uniformity
and clearness. On this nomenclature question we have, how-
ever, a complaint against the authors. The International Com-
mittee, whose work they uphold with so much enthusiasm, is

not the first body that has attempted a Code of Nomenclature.
It is hardly fair or just (as far as Britain is concerned at all
events) to say in the Preface ' we have neglected for more than
150 years one of the requisites of greatest importance' (/.&lt;?. a
Code of Nomenclature. In 1842, the Stricklandian Code, drawn
up by an influential Committee of the British Association, was first
published. It contained a code of rules which does not greatly
differ from the present rules of the International Committee, save
that the 12th edition of Linneus was taken as the starting point
instead of the 10th as at present agreed upon. It is, therefore,
obviously unfair to entirely ignore the labours of these earlier,
but not necessarily less able Zoologists.
We come yet to another point. After the publication of the
Stricklandian Code the names of the greater number of our British
birds became fixed, and it is, therefore, in our opinion, inadvis-
able to change names that have been in existence for over half-a-
century or more, when the assumption of the suggested name is
founded on a matter of opinion rather than priority. We will just
take one case to illustrate our point. During the latter half of the
iStli century the Hen and Montagu's Harrier were considered
the same species, but the females were thought to be a different
species from the males and known by the name of the ' Ringtail '
Hawk. Albin figures a Ringtail on which figure Linnaeus
bestows the name ' pygargus.&amp;apos; Early in the 19th century
Montagu, a keen and critical ornithologist, discovers that the
so-called 'Ring-tail' is only the young male or female of the
' Hen Harrier.' A discovery, by the way, which was brought
about by keeping them in confinement. He also discovers that
there are two species, now known as the Hen Harrier and
Montagu's Harrier, and he names the latter cineraceus and con-
siders pygargus as being a female Hen Harrier. According to
the Rules, both of the Stricklandian Code and of the Inter-
national Committee, if Albin's plate can be proved to be a
picture of the female Montagu's Harrier 'pygargus ' must stand
for that species. Half-a-ceutury ago, Prof. Newton and others
carefully went into the matter and decided that pygargus did
not refer solely to a female Montagu's Harrier, and, therefore,
could not be used for that species. In our opinion, this matter

having been settled by the highest authorities of the time, might
have been accepted without further question. However, it was
not, and their decision is reversed apparently because Albin's
figure is that of an English bird. As both species bred in
England in those days, we fail to grasp the significance of the
reasoning, but the fact remains that a well-established name has
been upset, a fact which of itself must lead to confusion.
Possibly the next generation may ignore this work as they
have ignored (in print at all events) the work of the last century,
and there will then be a further reversal of names. Apart from
the nomenclature, which after all is ornithologically but a minor
part of the book, we have nothing but praise for this handy
manual, which in bringing our present knowledge clearly up to
date, will prove of inestimable service to all working British
ornithologists.
PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
XVII.--WADERS.
By C. Barnby Smith.
Those small marsh or sea shore birds popularly known as
" Waders" are, I think, very interesting in many respects, but in
this beyond all, that they, with a little difficulty, may have their
enclosure so arranged as to make a pleasing little picture in the
garden--a thing that cannot be done with many other kinds of
birds. Water, of course, is a necessity, but this need not be in
great volume if it is kept fresh. My own arrangement as regards
water for my small Waders&amp;apos; aviary is a little pond formed by a
concrete bed about 5 yards by 3 yards edged with brick cemented
walls about 3 feet high, the top of the walls being below ground
level. The bottom of this little pond I covered with earth and
sods to an average depth of about i |feet, sloped the earth out-
side the pond in banks down to the top of the walls, covered the
top of the walls with sods of coarse growing grass, planted
rushes, flags, and semi-aquatic vegetation in and around the pond
(making one miniature island in addition), with the result that
the fact that the pond is artificially constructed is by no means

apparent. The water is supplied by pipe just above the level of
the walls, and as the adjoining soil is gravel and sand I merely
turn on a tap outside the aviary for a short time every few days
and let the pond overflow and the surplus water drain away into
the surrounding soil.
Near the pond are a few square yards of sand, which is
kept fresh by raking and a fresh sprinkling of sand given weekly.
In one corner of the aviary is a little shelter shed open on two
sides and with a couple of rhododendron bushes in front so that
it is hardly seen. In another corner near the water level is a
small area of mud, in which the birds like to dig. Outside the
aviary 011 two sides are privet hedges to afford shelter from
rough winds and the other two sides are pretty well sheltered by
distant bushes.
All Waders like to have a great deal of sunshine, and a
South aspect is most desirable. Both in winter and summer the
birds may be constantly seen basking in the sunshine after
feeding. The aviary should be of f-inch mesh wire netting let
into the ground one foot and turned horizontally outwards at
this depth for another foot so as to keep out rats. The supports
for the netting should be of iron tubes so arranged as to be as
little visible as possible. A few creepers up the iron supports
help to conceal them. It is also a good plan to plant several
clumps of tall growing iris, ribbon grass, etc., close to the wire
netting both inside and outside. This helps to hide the netting
and gives a pleasing effect.
As to Waders themselves, the great difficulty is to " get
them started." They usually arrive from netsmen or dealers in
poor condition--sometimes frightfully thin--and with feathers all
dirty through lack of access to water. Even if half-dead, the
birds will attempt to wash themselves, and as the feathers usually
under these circumstances fail to turn water the birds will look
" like drowned rats " every time they get wet and die in a week
or tw T 0, sometimes sooner. Then there is the question of getting
fresh caught birds to take artificial food. My plan is to put such
birds, in the first instance, by themselves in a covered enclosure
protected from wind and rain and only let them bathe for a short
time once a day at first. The water is taken away if necessary.

Practical Bird-Keeping.
I feed them on worms and maggots for the first few days, then
mix chopped worms and maggots amongst the artificial food so
that the birds get use to the latter gradually, and in the course of
a week or so are ready to turn out into the Waders aviary with
old established birds.
As to food for small Waders when established, I give in
the morning bread and milk with small pieces of raw meat
amongst it. In the afternoon the food is Victoria poultry meal
with shrimps softened in boiling water and chopped small , or
mussels according to season. I also have some dari or millet
thrown down on the sand, and some birds (especially Knots) are
very fond of this. Boiled rice is also very good. My Whimbrel,
glossy Ibis, and some Rails, which live in another enclosure,
have for years kept in splendid health on an exclusive diet of
boiled rice and raw meat mixed. It is good to keep fresh water
shrimps, water snails, etc., in water to which small Waders have
access, as even if the birds only get a few of these the constant
search to which they are tempted is good for their health.
Indeed, there is very soon a material difference in health between
those birds who are constantly employed searching for food and
those that have no incentive to do this.
A great trouble with newly-caught Waders is to get then*
to moult properly. Good general health, of course, induces this,
but I am satisfied that hot sun and warmth are advantageous,,
and indeed are a material factor in the case. Some of my birds
this spring have assumed better breeding plumage than ever
before and I quite think this is due to the abnormally hot
summer last year.
If birds arrive with clipped wings (as they often do) it is
well to presently pull out the feathers that have been cut, other-
wise these feathers will not moult properly. Care, however,,
should be taken not to pull out many feathers whilst birds are in
a weak state.
As to the different kinds of birds to keep--the bird of all
others for the beginner is the Arctic Knot. They are cheerful
and in good feather under almost all conditions and their quaint
croaking cry is a pleasant reminder of the sea shore. Next to
these should come Ruffs and Reeves. The antics of the former

never fail to elicit amusement from one's friends, and Reeves are
very dainty and elegant little birds. Oyster-catchers are easy ? to
keep but very nervous. Their long beaks are apt to split, and
when this happens the bird must be caught and the beak carefully
pared. Godwits are not difficult to keep when once established.
The Black-tailed is in my opinion far more desirable than the
Bar-tailed. Turnstones are not easy to obtain, but are most
striking in breeding plumage, and their habit of continually
turning over stones, etc., in search of food, is very amusing. I
find them quite easy to keep, fed and treated as above indicated,
but cannot say the same of Ringed Plover, Dunlins and Sander-
lings, which probably require more varied diet and closer
attention than I can give--anyhow, they do not thrive perman-
ently with me. I say " permanently " because it is quite easy to
keep these small birds for a few weeks or months, but as they
then usually get out of condition they cannot be regarded as
satisfactory inmates of an aviary such as mine. Golden Plover
and Grey Plover are not difficult to keep, but the Lapwing
generally gets out of condition and in my opinion it is cruel
to attempt to keep it in a small enclosure. The same remark
does not apply to its relative the spur-winged Cayenne Plover of
America, which gives me no difficulty in a small enclosure. It
is, however, a very fierce bird at times. I see that a few years
ago I wrote to the Avicultural Magazine urging the claims of the
Avocet as the most charming of Waders. Wider experience
(not my own only) has led me to believe that until we know
more of their needs it is useless to try and keep these delightful
birds. I am well aware that now and again Avocets are success-
fully kept, but the percentage of failure is enormous. Redshanks
are more delicate than many other birds and are apt to moult
badly. One of the most desirable birds for a small Waders
aviary is the Allen&amp;apos;s rail. It is, however, apt to catch cold if
allowed to roost out of doors in severe winters. The Martinique
Rail is also a charming little bird, but not so elegant. The
common English Water-Rail I have found quite easy to keep,
and it looks quite in place sneaking between clumps of rough
grass by the water's edge. The Australian Pectoral Rail if kept
with small birds should be watched closely, as it is apt to be

a bully. It gives, however, no trouble in itself, and at present I
have a pair nesting. Red-necked Phalaropes I have only kept a
short time. I brought some from Iceland a few years ago to give
to friends, whilst with me, the birds flourished on maggots and
were tame beyond belief. I would strongly urge on lovers of
small Waders the desirability of having red-necked Phalaropes,
which are not so difficult to obtain as is sometimes supposed.
Not many people have practical experience of them, but I have
known one live for two months kept in a large bedroom in a
house in the North of Iceland. In the end I believe it was
killed by accident. When I saw it, it was running about the
floor apparently quite contented. Snipe and Woodcock give
infinite trouble and are very difficult to keep in captivity. They
should only be attempted by experts.
If anyone could give the space, a good way to keep Waders
would be to have one large aviary for marsh birds, another large
aviary for sea-shore birds (imitating natural conditions so far as
possible in either case), with several smaller aviaries in which to
put birds from which it was desired to breed. Where many birds
are together in one aviary they usually disturb one another at
nesting time. I have had, within the last four years, two Reeves'
nests spoiled from this cause.

ROCK PEP LAR PARRAKEETS.

I have received your note asking me to send some account

<bodyText confidence="0.937274625" page_id="32659415"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
of my pair of Rock Pepiar Parrakeets. I am very pleased to
hear they are to be in the Magazine soon, but really I do not
know very well what to write about them.
I got them from Mr. Hamiyn about four years ago when
they were both in immature plumage, the only difference in the
cock bird being his larger size and his longer tail, but gradually
as year by year they moulted, the cock bird became more and
more yellow, until last year he really was perfect, and when I
exhibited the pair at the Scottish National Show in December I
was more than disappointed to find that they had only gained
second prize. They made splendid show birds, as they were
really very tame and did not mind &amp;apos;oeing in a small cage.
Usually I kept them in as big a cage as f could -- 6ft. high by
3ft. square -- and they seemed very happy. They had the usual
Parrakeet seed with green food when I had any.
This spring I noticed that the hen was a great deal in the
nest box and that the cock was constantly feeding her. but of
course, in the limited accommodation I could give them, it was
boneless to exnect any results, so when M:ss blare at V.bmoledon
wrote asking me if I would part with them. I almost considered
it a duty to let them go. where, with the fine avtartes she has,
there was every chance that they would nest successfully, f low,
since Australian Parrakeets are so scarce, I think aviculturists
should do all they can to assist the breeding or these rarer

It is a fact too certain to be disputed, that whereas one
bird-owner may repeatedly try year after year, without success,
to breed birds both in cages and spacious aviaries (adopting every
approved method and using every appliance calculated to induce
his birds to go to nest) another owner, having no special know-
ledge and taking no means whatever to attain his object, will
discover even such shy breeders as Waxbills bringing up a family
of youngsters in some most unsuitable receptacle fixed up in a
Crystal Palace cage standing upon a table in a dwelling-room.
At one time I had practically eleven aviaries and about
sixteen large flight-cages; I did everything I could think of or
that any of my experienced avicultural friends could suggest to
induce my numerous birds to breed, but my success was never
very brilliant, although in the case of a few common species J
had no cause for complaint, since I had to give away or sell many
of the young in order to avoid overcrowding.
During the last few years I have not felt justified in
replenishing my stock of birds, and therefore have devoted much
of my time to my old hobby--floriculture. My feathered family
has slowly dwindled to about a seventh of its former size, the
survivors being mostly more or less ancient, and all, as I supposed,
probably past the breeding age.
Towards the end of May a lady informed my son that she
was giving up her present house and did not wish to keep her
birds, which consisted of one cock Canary, two cock Budgerigars
and two Java Sparrows and she wished to know whether I would
accept them : I said O'yes. they would give no extra trouble, as
I should turn the Canary into my Finch aviary and the others
into one opposite, in which my last surviving Java Sparrow still
lived.
The day after I had let these birds fly, I observed a hen
which I take to be the St. Helena Seed-eater (given to me by

Lieut. Horsbrugh in November 1906) carrying about a piece of
dead grass : I tore up some fibrous loam and threw the dry roots
into the aviary and the bird constructed a flimsy nest which she
failed to line although I gave her plenty of soft material which
she managed to waste, and when I put a lining into the nest she
pulled it all out. The nest, such as it was, was placed in a
sponge-basket hanging on the wires at the back of the aviary
and three eggs were deposited upon the wicker bars of the
basket, there being no bottom to the nest. One egg hatched
about thirteen days later, and as food for the young one I daily
put in a saucer containing some of the soft mixture prepared for
my Insectivorous birds; with this and a little cliickweed the
Canary fed the mother, who afterwards attended to the youngster.
On the 11 th June, in the aviary opposite, I saw a Chingolo
Song-Sparrow, sent to me by Mr. Teschemaker on October 30th,
1907, courting a hen Tree-Sparrow given to me by Mr. Allen
Silver about a year later. The two birds behaved in every respect
like a pair of House-Sparrows, which is rather remarkable if the
Song-Sparrows are actually Buntings, as Dr. Sharpe decided
that they were. Unfortunately Tree-Sparrows are so hopelessly
wild, even after years of captivity, that not the slightest attempt
was made even to collect materials for a nest, and if eggs were
laid no sign of their existence could be discovered.
On June 22nd the Canary hybrid left the nest in excellent
health and plumage; it much resembled its mother in general
appearance.
On June 26th the Seed-eater again began to carry about
building materials, and on the following day she began to line a
cocoauut-shell fixed on a dead fir-tree in the aviary ; as before
she proved a very poor architect and when she began to sit on
July 2nd there was hardly any building-material in the shell.
The eggs of this bird are pure white with a few small
blackish spots at the larger end ; they differ at a glance from
those of the Green Singing-finch which are cream-coloured,
broader, of a less true oval shape and rather more numerously
dotted with blackish : in fact (excepting that they are much
larger) they resemble those of the Grey Singing-finch, which
the St. Helena Seedeater also resembles in its less frequent and

more powerful song: it seems odd that two birds differing
greatly both in size and colouring should agree closely both in
their eggs and their vocal performances, but colouring does not
appear to be much test of affinity : I have no doubt, from a study
of Rose-finches in captivity, that they are much more closely
related to the Serins than to the Bullfinches; their fugitive
colouring also is less characteristic of the latter than of the
Linnets, which again seem nearly allied to the Serins.
So far as I could see into the nest, the second clutch con-
sisted of two eggs, upon which the mother at first sat very
unsteadily, flying off at once if one looked at her from the out-
side of the aviary ; later she became much more steady, which
inclined me to hope that the eggs were fertile; however, they
did not hatch, and as the bird continued to sit I examined the
nest on July 21st and found two clear eggs which of course I
took away.
Now if I had been a lucky breeder I should have had a
nest of hybrid Sparrows and two full nests of hybrid Canaries
instead of getting only one (probably hen) bird from the two
pairs : yet breeding is not altogether a toss-up, and I do not
doubt that much of my want of success was due for many years
to the fact that my aviaries were overcrowded, though it cannot
be denied that in some overcrowded aviaries most satisfactory
results have occasionally been attained.
Perhaps it has been better for aviculture that I have not
been a very successful breeder: if I had been, perhaps I should
have been content to record my experiences in a series of short
scattered articles, instead of bringing out text-books collating
the information acquired by the experience of workers through-
out Europe during the past century. No doubt there is some
truth in the old saying that &amp;quot;whatever is. is best."

By R. CoSGRAVK.
One of the most interesting events here this summer is
the nesting of a female Greater Sulphur Crested (Cacatua
galeritd) and Rose-breasted male Cockatoo (C. cos).
Last autumn these birds were given full liberty owing to
their untidy and destructive habits. During the first week of
liberty they were very shy and wandered about a good deal,
eventually coming back to their old home for good, and settled
down in the immediate neighbourhood, amusing themselves
amongst the trees, whose softer parts came in for a good deal of
attention. During last winter a large walnut tree, within twenty
yards of the aviary, took their fancy more than any other, and
in this they set about in earnest to build a home. None of the
many holes in this tree were large enough to admit them; so
selecting one, a little more than half way up, they worked away
at it in turns, until a good-sized comfortable abode was ready.
The amount of chins they ejected was astonishing, amounting to
several bucket-loads, to the horror of the gardener, who declared
they would kill the tree and ought to have their necks twisted ;
it was good going and did not take very long as this particular
bough was more or less decomposed. The way in which one
worked while the other rested close by was especially notice-
able.
During the last week in March we noticed that the two
birds did not come to feed together as usual. I suspected that
they had a nest and kept a sharp look out, but neither of the
birds would go near the tree while anyone was about who would
be likely to see them. Taking cover within sight of the tree, I
was rewarded after a long wait to see the male come 011 one of

was 110 one in sight, dropped quietly close to the nest and looked
in, a hasty whisper and out came the female who went straight
away to the food-pan, the male at once took her place on the nest.
By this behaviour I was quite sure that the nest contained eggs;
after a few more days the birds did not mind in the least who
saw them visit the nest. When three weeks had passed, by
means of a long ladder, we had a look in the nest and were

pleased to see cue young bird, recently hatched, probably three
or four days old, and one unhatched pure white egg, about the
size and shape of the Eagle Owl's (Bubo maximus).
The youngster's head and neck was quite nude, its body
was covered with short, whitish down, and it was apparently a
healthy bird ; in case of causing harm no time was lost in getting
down and removing the ladder out of sight, as the old birds were
in such a state of mind at our presence. On May 29th the young-
ster left the nest, but was not seen until the following day, being
cunningly hidden in a large Beech tree, right away from the nest;
when discovered it was sitting with the parents, one on each side.
It looked fully developed and about the size and shape of the male.
Wings, tail and mantle a light grey; head, neck and all under
parts sulphur, with the exception of a salmon-coloured patch
on each ear about the size of a sixpence, and a dash of grey on
the crop, neatly blended with the prevailing sulphur-colour;
eyes, black; bill, light horn ; feet, brown ; crest, short, extending
only to the nape ; colour, a mixture of sulphur and light rose;
when on the wing more rose colour is noticeable than when the
birds are at repose. The parents are very devoted to it; they
feed from the crop, and when doing so like to stand on a bough
or twig, over the youngster. We give them filberts, walnuts,
monkey nuts, maize, wheat and bread daily, besides this they
find a good deal of natural food, paying several daily visits to a
Lucerne field three-quarters-of-a-mile away. I cannot say what
they brought, as a good crop of various weeds are in flower on
this particular field.
On June 1st all three birds returned to the aviary and sat
on the highest part. The surprise of the youngster's first sight
of the inmates was amusing. I believe it thought that the Night
Herons and Laughing Jackass were his brothers and sisters,
they certainly appealed to its curiosity the most; the amusing
part of all was to watch the old birds trying to drive away the
other birds who persisted in having nests in the same tree.
First of all were a pair of Indian Green Parrakeets, whose young
we expect to see emerge daily ; then a pair of Stock Doves, a
pair of Jackdaws, and last, four pairs of Starlings. I shot the
Jackdaws as soon as I possibly could ; all the others were success-

The Cockatoos are much too clumsy to cope with these birds
amongst the branches and the holes were too small to admit them
to follow up the attack. Latterly they gave up this game as
useless, and were content with sitting still and making use of

WOOD OWLS.
Syrnium aluco.
By Katharine Cukrey.
In a little article entitled "Pet Owls'&amp;quot; in the January
number of the Avicultural Magazine, I mentioned the accidental
escape of one of my pair of Wood Owls from its aviary, and
although all the means we could think of were taken to entice it
back, it never re-entered the cage, or if it did, it flew out again.
A Wood Owl has visited the deserted mate constantly since then,
sitting in the yews overhanging the cage and calling, and I think
it is probably, the mate. A sequel to the little episode has
happened since then that may interest those who keep Owls.
It chanced that I left home some weeks after the Owl
escaped, and on the very day after my departure, a Wood Owl
made its v?a.y into the aviary by burrowing under the wire on the
ground. Of course, it was assumed to be the lost pet and the
good news was sent to me forthwith.
But on my return I found it was not the lost mate, but a
stranger, and very young and wild. I watched it for a few days,
but as the deserted Owl took no notice beyond snapping at it
with a very bored expression, I let it fly. My poor Owl, mean-
time, looked so dull and forlorn that I began to wonder if it
would like a companion, and whether the presence of another
Owl in its cage might have the effect of bringing the old mate
back into the aviary.
About that time I chanced to hear of three Wood Owls
wanting a good home. Two were hand-reared, and thought to
be a pair, though the owner was not sure about it, or of the sex
of an\' of the three, while I was equally in the dark as to the sex

of my Owl. I still watched and waited, hoping against hope for
the missing mate to come back, but in vain, so I got the three
trusting that one of them might take to my Owl and my poor
Owl to it, and turned them out into the vacant division that had
been wired off to tempt the deserter back. Its mate sat in
solitary state next door. The new comers proved to be two
different kinds of the Tawny Owl ; two very large, with darker
brown markings, the arrow-tips very clearly defined and the
w 7 hite conspicuous ; the third, a smaller Owl, had vellower-browu
plumage, and the markings were more blurred. They were all
very tame, and at once took to their new cage, the two sitting
together on a high perch and number three humbly taking a
seat below 7 .
They arrived in the afternoon, and were only half aw 7 ake,
while my Owl w 7 as fast asleep behind a yew stem. When it grew 7
dusk I w 7 ent to them again. My owl seemed unconscious of their
presence, stayed where it w r as and blinked. All four might have
been Eastern Potentates from their complete imperturbability.
For days they never looked at my Owl, nor it at them, nor did
either seem aw 7 are of the presence of the other. This w 7 ent on
for some time, the new comers gently calling at night and my
Ow 7 l hooting as usual. So I transferred the large pair into an
aviary in another part of the garden, and removed the w 7 ire
partition, letting number three and my Owl meet.
They took no notice of each other, one sitting on a tree, the
other on a perch, nor did they manifest either pleasure or anger.
After a few days they w 7 ere sitting on the same perch and now 7
they roost close together. The other day as I w 7 alked up to their
aviary in the dusk, another Owl softly fluttered off the top of it,
and sailed up into a sycamore tree. Was this the lost mate?
And if so? -- I dare not think of its w 7 ounded and outraged
feelings, though in one w 7 ay, it has only 7 itself to blame.
The large Ow 7 ls have different tastes, for one sits out on a
bough in the sun, while the other remains in a dark corner
behind an old w 7 alnut trunk. Very seldom both are out in the
day. Their cage abuts on the stable wall, and mice and rats
abound, the latter in old runs. But now any young rats seen in
the cage speedily disappear, and the supplies of mice diminish.

Now we have an 'embarras de richesses' as regards Owls,
for not only do the two pairs shout to each other, but the number
of visitors they have is wonderful, and the chorus at night of
soft melodious tu-whit, tu-whoos varied by sharp screeches and
me wings and whistlings; if the music were not all in the minor
key, it would inevitably keep one awake. Sometimes my Owls call
in the afternoon, and occasionally in the morning. On a very
dark day, when the North wind blew over to us some London
atmosphere, the Owls hooted at noon.
I feel we have not reached the final chapter with my Owl
and its new friend, for if the former mate ever comes back,
hoping to build a nest with it in the hollow tree, I shall do all
I can to entice it in, and number three will have to be disposed
of otherwise. What my deserted Owl's views will be in the matter
remains to be seen.
Since this was written, the nesting season has passed
without any sign of the wanderer's return.

familiar form ; Prof. Newton, however, tells us that " it is iuadmiss-
able owing to its prior use in Entomology" (it has been applied to a
genus of beetles). If, however, the " Avis galeritus " of Pliny is the
" Elauda cristata " of Linnaeus, the name has a good standing and
a further consideration is that it has a definite meaning, whereas

The Crested Lark has a most extensive range in the Old
World--from Spain to Northern China, from South Sweden and
Central Asia to Senegal and Southern India. Its preference is
for bare and barren countries--even for deserts--and it is found
in greatest numbers in the warmest parts ot its range. Environ-
ment has naturally caused the usual variations in point of size
and plumage and the enthusiastic museum-naturalist has taken
advantage of this fact to present us with more than thirty sub-

Mr. W. E. Thschemaker,
species. For all that, the Crested Lark stands out a well-marked
type--in fact the type of its genus.
Its habits also naturally vary with locality. For instance,
Irby could never find any evidence that this species migrated,
even at so favourable a station for observing migrants as Gibraltar,
but Oates tells us that the great majority of those vast multi-
tudes of Crested Laiks that during the cold season meet us on
every bare plain and every stubble-field, throughout the drier
and better cultivated portions of Continental India at any rate,
are, I am convinced, migratory. A certain number, however,
unquestionably remain to breed." The only time that I have
personally come across this species in a state of freedom was on
a high road near the little village of Mougins in the south of
France and roads appear to be a favourite resort for this bird and
have earned for it its Spanish name of Carretera . It even nests
on roads. Irby says --" One nest which I found was placed
between the tracks of a much frequented road near Tangier, in
such a position that every passing animal must have touched the
small clump of grass under which the nest was built. Now, was
this site chosen because snakes, lizards and other vermin were
less likely to come on the beaten track ? " We find an interesting
parallel to this in Oates. A correspondent from the Saliarunpoor
district in India states that he found "one nest in the middle of
a village-cart track near a low bush between the wheel-tracks."
The cause of this habit may well be that suggested by Irby for,
in a note supplied by a correspondent in Scinde, we find the
following :-- " It is a wonder to me how many of the eggs of this
species are ever hatched, as out of many dozens of nests, which
I left this year with single eggs in them to take later on, I found
invariably on returning a day or two after that the nests were
empty. What it is that takes the eggs I do not know (possibly
foxes, as I saw their 'pugs') but, whatever animal it is, it must
be an uncommonly clever nest-seeker as hardly an egg seems to
escape notice." However the Carietera does not restrict itself to
roads and cultivated districts: it may be seen, according to Irby,
" on the seashore running about like aSanderling within a yard
of the water " and also on the verge of the trackless Sahara.
From an avicultural point of view the Crested Lark has

<bodyText confidence="0.998515736842105" page_id="32659425"  page_num="275" year="" vol="">
much to recommend it. It is extremely hardy and takes kindly
either to a cage or an aviary. Unlike our Skylark, the males of
which species are absolutely intolerable in the breeding season,
the Carretera is at all times extremely peaceable and inoffensive.
I have watched it closely when rearing its young this summer
and have been much impressed by the fact that, despite its bulk
and powerful beak, it would allow any other bird-- even a pair of
Woodlarks-- to approach its nest. Moreover it is a bird which
shows itself freely in fin aviary, spending much of its time on the
wing and perching boldly even on slender twigs. Though never
becoming very familiar it does not possess that most annoying
habit -- so common among the harks -- of going up, when flushed,
like a sky-rocket into the zenith and for this reason its long,
silky crest, of which it is evidently very proud, is generally
intact.
But the greatest attraction of this species I have kept to
the last -- its gift of song -- and I lay special emphasis on this
because I think I might almost claim to have discovered the
Carretera as a song-bird. Its biographers have told 11s much
about its habits and appearance but of its song they have either
said nothing or have even spoken slightingly. In a sense they
have been right in their estimate for its ordinary song is not
remarkable and is often marred by discords, but they seem to
have entirely overlooked the fact that this bird possesses fin
unrivalled latent gift of mimicry. Some half-dozen years since
I spent a considerable time trying to discover the identity ol an
unknown songster in one of my aviaries. The song would
commence with a plaintive warbling, soft and sweet as the breath
of spring; then the pitch would rise and one would distinctly
detect the silvery notes of the Blackcap; then it would fall and
would merge into the mellow lay of a Garden Warbler, changing
in a single instant to the bubbling strain of the Starling. Over
and over again I stalked the singer but always with the same result
-- the instant cessation of the song. At last one day through a
screen of leaves I saw a swelling throat and a sandy tail all
a-quiver : it was a Carretera perched in an apple-tree. Not all
Crested Larks sing as well as that one but all will show some
talent, if caged separately, and I have one now, for which a

Berlin dealer charged me two marks, fifty, which can repeat any
passage of bird-music which you like to put before him. Should
any real interest ever be kindled in this country for singing-birds
an event, however, about as probable as the advent of the
Millennium) I prophesy that the Crested Lark will come into
its own and that its trade price will no longer be half-a-crown !
In India, however, the Crested Lark is esteemed as a song-
bird. as I hear from Mr. C. Harrison of Tiverton, a skilled
aviculturist who spent many years in that country. He writes: --
It is kept either in a bamboo cage or in a wood or wire one:
the cages have no sand-trays but a piece of sacking and the dirt
is scraped out with a scraper through the bars. The Larks are
given brick-dust to dust themselves in. the food and water being
inside the cages in the corners, where the pans are kept in position
either by tying or by a piece of bamboo acting as a spring. They
are fed on parched &amp;quot; gram flour mixed with clarified butter, also
on millet, with some grasshoppers for live-food.&amp;quot; It seems to
me an interesting and suggestive fact that in two of the oldest
civilizations of the world--the Indian and Chinese Empires --
song-birds should be so highly esteemed, whereas the younger
nations of Western Europe, with the possible exceptions of the
Germans and perhaps of the Italians of the 16th and 17th
centuries, either set no value on them or only value them as table
delicacies.
At one time or another I have possessed quite half-a-dozen
Crested Larks but I never tried to procure a hen until this
&amp;gt;easou when the before-mentioned German dealer sent me a pair
** a Rechnung wh ck included an item : five marks for
the same. The sex of these two birds was rather a puzzle, for
the smallest one with the boldest markings was apparently the
male, whereas in the case of most species or Larks, or which the
-exes are similarly marked, the female is usually the smaller and
the better marked. They at once made themselves quite at home
in the large aviary and were inseparable. This accords with the
ird-forks, which state that the Carrsterj. is never found in docks
at always in fairs or small family parties.
Ah rut the middle of May the smaller bird which by this time
I had fnl y identified as the male, au exceptioual circumstance.

of course), began to carry large beakfuls of grass and did his best
to induce the female to build in a secluded corner. They used to
flirt most outrageously and I may here remark that the Carretera
seems to be a sort of buffoon of bird society ; he never does any-
thing without a vast amount of prancing, posturing and grimac-
ing and apparently does his very best on all occasions to add to
the gaiety of the community in which he finds himself by making
himself ridiculous. But, though he likes to pose as a wag, he is
anything but a fool, The female, however, had other views and
I was very much annoyed to see that she had decided to build in
the most open part of the aviary, close to the spot where I am in
the habit of placing my observation chair.
According to Oates the Crested Lark generally makes use
of some small depression in the ground, as for instance the print
of a cow's hoof for its nest but my birds certainly dug out with
their stout beaks a circular cavity and, what is more, they dug
several before they were quite satisfied with the result, and then
lined the cavity with fine grass. The nest was not placed in a
tuft but in a spot w&amp;apos;here the grass was rather thin and it was
therefore not particularly well concealed. It was completed on
the Sth June; the first egg was laid on the 10th. The clutch of
four eggs was completed on the 13th, but incubation commenced
on the 12th. The eggs were rather large, the ground-colour
cream, thickly spotted with light terra-cotta, dark-brown and
a few purplish blotches. The eggs were so unlike one another
that one would think that each one had been taken from a
different clutch. One had confluent markings forming a circular
blotch on the apex, another had the spots equally distributed
over its &amp;apos;whole surface and the remaining two showed rings of
spots at the point where the diameter w 7 as greatest.
As far as I could ascertain only the female incubated and
she was the most unsteady sitter that I have ever known, in fact it
seemed to me impossible that the eggs should hatch in view of
the length of time that they were left every day uncovered in a
thinly lined nest on the cold ground and in particularly wet and
chilly 7 weather. I see by reference to my note-book that the only
day without rain during the period of incubation was the 22nd.

and friend. Wise Old Mother Nature was whispering in their
ear. Yes, with the experience of a thousand thousand years she
was telling them what to do and how to do it. The three little
Larks were sitting up in their nest in an almost erect position,
facing one another with their breasts pressed closely together.
Their wide beaks were pointing upwards almost vertically and
also pressed closely together, thus forming&amp;apos; the apex ot a cone.
Their necks were retracted, thus bringing the thick tufts of down
and feathers on the crown and back together, and their wings --
by this time showing quill leathers -- were held closely to their
sides. If my description has been sufliciently clear, you will
at mice grasp the meaning and object of those tufts, you will
realize that each little back formed a cleverly- designed water-
shed, and you will understand why rain does not. kill young
Larks. When the North American Indian sticks three poles in
the ground, lashes their tops together and throws a skin over
this framework he makes a " tepee," and we regard the " tepee"
as the product of his inventive faculty. But evidently the
"tepee" is an old idea -- as old as the hills. Long before the
Indian set foot on the New World "tepees" were being erected
on the wide Campo of Southern Spain, on the vast Steppe of
Central Asia -- by the Carreicra !
Although the Coneteras did not think it necessary to brood
their young closely, they used to feed them most diligently, and
were extremely careful never to approach the nest when anyone
was near the aviary. Once or twice I waited as long as half-an-
liour to see the young fed, but always in vain. Under such cir-
cumstances most birds who are feeding young will fuss about
for some time and then even risk taking a beak I u 1 of live-bait to
the nest under your observation, or else will throw the aforesaid
live-bait away in a petulant manner. But not so the Crested
Larks. I was much amused by the extremely sensible, patient
and methodical way in which they faced the situation. They
simply retired to a little distance, taking a nice plump maggot
with them, squatted down on a convenient ledge and waited.
The expiration of half-an-hour would find them in the sell same
position still treasuring the same fat maggot. No doubt in the

they have to be particularly careful not to give away the position
of the nest to either two-legged or four-legged nest-hunters, and
their opportunities of visiting the nest unobserved are probably
few and far between.
On the 6th July the young Larks left the nest, which shows
us how Nature can expedite her processes when she thinks it
expedient, for some young Rock Pipits, hatched the same day, did
not fly until the 10th. Their prevailing colour was greyish, the
tips of the primary and secondary coverts, of the secondaries and
anterior margins and tips of the primaries pale buff. The under-
parts were whitish with a faint tinge of buff; the outer tail-
feathers sandy. They still showed some down on the crown but
this was soon displaced by a crest of fair length. A warmer
colouring soon made its appearance, the superciliary streak being
warm buff, and some mottled feathers appeared on the breast,
their backs also becoming mottled which gave them a somewhat
mottled appearance. In a wonderfully short space of time they
became independent and learned how to dig for a bieakfast.

By Mrs. McConnell.
I am writing a few notes on my very hap-hazard aviaries
and my nesting successes and failures, hoping they may be of
some interest to bird-lovers like myself who cannot afford any
very expensive structures, and also that the smallest contribu-
tions may be thankfully received by our kind Editor at this slack
time of year.
A11 enclosure was originally made in a sheltered part of
the garden and close to the house, 70ft. by 30ft. in area, wooden
frame and sparrow-proof wire-netting for growing small fruits,
but as wild birds were shut out all the year round it was a failure
for this purpose, everything being eaten up by blight. I soon
appropriated one end of it for birds and built a simple wooden
shed with concrete floor as shelter. This was followed by others,
and now the whole is given up to birds, and there are seven
divisions and seven sheds of varying sizes, all erected by my own
men, and some with only the ground for floor. I surrounded the

whole base with small mesh wire, burying it six inches in the
ground as protection from mice, rats, etc. ; covered some divisions
entirely with half-inch wire for small birds and planted them
with evergreen shrubs and ivy on the supports. Greenery is no
use for Parrakeets as they soon destroy it, but I have a pair of
Many-Coloured who do not do so. Strong springs on all doors,
so that they cannot be left open, is a good safeguard. There is
no attempt at heating, and many Parrakeets and small birds
generally considered delicate have survived many winters in
this place.
This year, my pair of Many-Coloured -- who last year reared
four in one nest to maturity, began to think of nesting earl)&amp;apos;- in
February. The hen disappeared into her log nest the first week
in March, and in due time the voices of young were heard, and
so strong were they in two or three weeks time, that I allowed
curiosity to get the better of prudence, and took down the nest
to see when I thought the old birds were not looking that way.
There were four strong young ones and, horrible to relate, they
were never fed again. Last year I had done the same thing
without any tragic result, but I suppose the nestlings were older.
I have found a dead one in a nest poisoning the others, and this
is my excuse to myself, but it is certainly wiser not to look.
I am now anxiously awaiting the appearance of a nest-full
of young hybrids between a Platycercus flaveolus lieu and a Yellow-
naped or Port Lincoln cock. This morning (15th July) my man
tells me he is sure they have been hatched more than two months,
so I have taken down the log nest and looked in ; there are three
strong, young birds, well-fledged and looking very bright in
colour with bright red frontal bands. Yesterday, I saw one
appear, head and shoulders at the nest hole, several times, and
I expect they will be fully out this or next day.
I have not many other successes to record. A pair of
Virginian Cardinals hatched out two, earl}&amp;apos; in March, in a nest
made of coarse bents and lined with finer grass, in a small fir
tree. The nestlings came out of the nest in less than a week,
and squatted about near it, incessantly crying for food, which
both parents were most assiduous in supplying. They had an
unlimited supply of mealworms, beetles, and fresh ants' eggs.

and all kinds of grubs dug up by the gardener, who always has
some reeeDtacle to put them in when working. The old birds
become wonderfully tame and confiding when feeding young,
though rather wild and shy at other times. The hen again laid
two eggs in the old nest, but they were no good, and now she
has just died, I think from eating too many mealworms. One of
the first nestlings was killed by some bird pecking its mouth
badly, it was always opening its mouth and crying for food to
an}&amp;apos; bird that came near, and no doubt annoyed somebody. The
survivor is a hen and quite full-grown, only lacking the red beak.
Two Californian Quails have laid an immense number of
eggs, and both began to sit early last month, but one died quite
unaccountably after sitting a few days, and the other, who sat in
a nest prepared for a domestic hen, was disturbed by another hen
laying an egg in the midst of her's. These Quail are in a large
enclosure in another part of the garden, where I keep rare
bantams. I used to have great success with these delightful
birds and have several times had twenty and more hatched out
and reared in one nest, but have failed with them entirely the
last two years.
A Black-breasted cock Quail and a Chinese hen made a
nest in a heap of grass in a corner of a shed and laid five eggs ;
three disappeared, one was addled and one hatched out. They
are the prettiest little family, always together and most devoted
to the tiny baby, who gets through an unbelievable amount of
mealworms, ants' eggs, etc., and the hen clucks and broods
exactly like a domestic fowl. The little one is now nearly full-
grown and the hen preparing a second nest; they are quite tame
and charming little birds.
Any number of Canaries and Canary x Goldfinch hybrids,
a pair of Bronze-winged Doves, and many white and cream
coloured Doves make up the tale of nesting successes this year,
and I cannot complain, as I have not been able to keep up the
pairs of birds and have a good many odd ones, also some of my
Parrakeets have been disturbed. Better luck next year I hope.
I should like at some future time to give some statistics of
the wonderful longevity of some birds in my possession.

By K. Sherbrooke.
I have been asked to write something for the Magazine,
and having no aviary experiences to relate, I thought a short
account of the birds I have seen here might be interesting.
My knowledge of birds is rather superficial, and I can
only write as a lover of them and not from a scientific point of
view. This house is only about a hundred yards from the sea,
not the open sea, but a little bay with a rocky island about the
middle, which can be reached on foot at low tide. This is the
home of a pair or two of Oyster Catchers, but I have not been
able to find their nests, which I think are there, somewhere
concealed amongst the rocks and tufts of thrift which grows
profusely all about the cliffs. Kittiwakes and Terns also spend
much time on these rocks, and a green Cormorant or two
are generally swimming about the bay, taking headlong dives
at short intervals. The last few days two or three Divers
have appeared, I think the Red-throated, but I have not got near
enough to be certain, and they fill the bay with their weird
noises, beginning with a mew as of a giant cat and finishing off
like an unearthly dog fight! On the beach a pair of Ring
Plovers dart along the sand and whistle monotonously. I found
a nest on an island a few miles off with four tin) 7 young ones
lying immovable like little mottled grey stones ; one of the party
did a photograph of them, but unluckily it was not a success.
Nearly all the birds about here are very tame, possibly
being in such a majority they feel safe, the human population
being exceedingly small ; in fact, one feels that the country
belongs to the birds and one is only here on sufferance. Where-
ever you go you are being watched, far from silently, as the
Gulls bark overhead, the Oyster-catchers scream about the rocks,
Wheatears chatter at you from the stones, and Twites and Pipits
flutter round in great agitation if you approach their nests. A
pair of Buzzards have nested and brought off their young a few
miles away, and we were lucky enough to see a Golden Eagle
soaring towards the mountain of Ouinaig a few days ago. Of
course the great feature of this coast is the island of Handa,
and parties are continually going off in boats to see the birds.

Among the Birds in Sutherland.
It is like a gigantic bee-hive, even from here, four miles off;
with glasses you can see the stream of birds flying from the
cliffs to sea and back again. The whole effect is wonderful
from the sea, but there is generally such a swell that it is
difficult to make out individual birds; these can be seen better
from the cliffs, and by lying flat and looking over the edge one
can see into the nests. We had a good view of the Fulmar
Petrels in that way and saw one white egg. I believe they have
only nested on Handa since 1893, and are supposed to have
come from St. Kilda. The air is full of Guillemots and Razor-
bills bobbing in the water like corks and flying with extra-
ordinary rapidity, apparently to nowhere in particular, they set
out as if to go for miles with immense determination, and then
suddenly collapse into the sea with a splash. I think I made out
three different species of Guillemots, and a fisherman tells me
he saw a pure white one a few days ago. The Puffins seemed
to be rather less numerous than when I was here some years
ago, but the time of year may make the difference. The in-
cessant noise is very striking, but not at all unpleasant, rather
like distant bagpipes or violins in a high key. I have found
several Eider Ducks nests, but now, the end of June, I think
they have mostly hatched off. One or two pair of duck in the
bay I am told are Pintail, and some wild geese were seen flying,
which I hear breed on the islands in the next bay, and I intend
to visit them and see if it is so, one cannot quite depend upon
local information. Since then I have seen a nest and five gos-
lings with their parents.
The Terns have been here about a fortnight, and are now
laying on the islands, and the stately Gannet sails about the
open sea. The Lesser Black-backed Gull is quite plentiful, I
have not seen many of the Greater. The Cormorant is ubiqui-
tous, there must be hundreds just round here; they nest on
Handa and the Badcall islands, a comfortable-looking nest with
a fringe of green round it. Some Sandpipers have been flying
about the garden, and I have seen one Dipper on the rocks, but
not the Ring Ouzel, which I rather expected to find here.
If anyone wishes to spend some time in the bird-world, I
can recommend the coast of Sutherland in June.

The most important arrival for some time past is that of a
young Shoebill (Balceniceps rex) which reached the Gardens on
June 29th. It was presented to the Zoological Society by Sir
Reginald Wingate, and brought home by Captain A. L,. Butler,
the Game Warden of the Sudan. In i860 the Society received
two specimens of this very remarkable Heron. These lived but
a short time, and there have been none in Europe since, although
there are three at Giza and one at Khartoum.
I would refer our members to an excellent paper on this
bird by Captain Stanley Flower, which appeared in this journal
in 1S9S (Vol. VI. Second series, p. 191).
There have been few new arrivals during the past month,
but nesting has been going on. The two young Scarlet Tanagers
that I mentioned last month, unfortunately both died after
leaving the nest. At that stage they were barely fledged, and
quite unable to stand the cold and damp that, as luck would have
it, set in just at the critical moment of their lives.
The Magpie Tanagers made an open nest of grasses in a
privet bush about seven feet from the ground. Two eggs were
laid, and as I write they have two young ones about three days
old.
The White-throated Ground Thrushes which I mentioned
last month as having successfully reared a pair of young birds,
are now sitting again and just about due to hatch their second
brood.
Crimson Finches are sitting ; and a pair of Plale's Parrot
Finches are rearing a brood of three or four young birds.
The pair of Cariamas which bred successfully last year
have another young bird, now just a month old.
In the Great Aviary a Black-headed Gull has paired with
an Australian Silver or Jameson's Gull. They hatched three
young birds, but these were taken by other birds, probably Ibises
or Night Herons. They laid again and we took the eggs and
hatched out two chicks, which are progressing well in charge of
a bantam hen.
But of considerably greater interest is the hatching of a

young Hemprich's Gull (Larus hemprichi). In 1896 Mr. Meade-
Waldo presented the Zoological Society with three of these Gulls,
a pair and their young one, which he had captured on board ship
in the Gulf of Aden. They are the only examples the Society
has possessed, and until this year the}&amp;apos; have shown no inclination
to nest.
Chiefly confined to the Gulf of Aden, little is known of
the nesting habits of Hemprich's Gull, and so far as I know the
young in down has not been described. One expected a mottled
bird like the young of most of the Gulls, but greatly to one's
surprise this chick is of a nearly uniform huffish white, slightly
darker on the back. The parent birds are laying again so we
hope to rear others.
I11 one of the outside aviaries of the Parrot House a pair
of Yellow-collared Parrakeets have reared a couple of young
ones, strong healthy birds, exactly like their parents, except that
their plumage is not quite so bright.
We recently had three Eider Duck's eggs presented to us,
which were set under a hen, with the result that one hatched and
a nice young Eider is being reared with a brood of young Tufted
Ducks.
In one of the aviaries outside the Small Bird House a pair
of Mexican Rose Finches built a nest in a cage hung against the
wall, and have succeeded in hatching and rearing three young
birds.
At this time of year the pair of Australian Bee-eaters
which occupy one of these outside aviaries, form one of the most
attractive exhibits at the Gardens. They have now lived with us
for fifteen months and have done remarkably well. So tame are
they that they will fly on to one's hands for mealworms and
appear absolutely fearless. Their activity on the wing is wonder-
ful, and I do not believe that any bee, wasp or fly that enters the
aviary ever escapes them. They are constantly making flights
from the perch after insects that are to human eyes invisible, but
they always return with an insect of some sort in their beaks.
Bee-eaters are seldom kept in captivity, but in an aviary no birds
are more delightful. D. S.-S.

Our neighbours' ornithological journal for the months
under review contains numerous articles of interest iu all
branches of Ornithology. In this country, where the ornitho-
logical magazines are more numerous, they have also become
more specialized and in consequence of less interest to the
general reader.
In France, however, this Magazine deals with ail kinds of
Ornithological matters, systematic work, migration, foreign birds,
native birds, aviculture, etc., etc., and thus every bird-lover,
whatever their particular tastes, will find something of interest,
Space will not permit us to deal with the articles individually.
We have a long and carefully drawn up list of the fossil birds of
France, several articles on the recent immigration of Crossbills
and their status in different parts of the country, notes on
Tunisian birds by Dr. Nullet Horsin, notes on Hawking with a
Goshawk by Prince Ernest d'Aremburg, as well as many shorter
notes on the occurrence of rare birds, varieties, etc. in different
parts of France.
Of more especial interest to aviculturists are the articles
by M. A. Vaucher on the Great Bustard, dealing more especially
with plumages, by M. Rene Bacon on the Wintering of Birds in
outdoor aviaries, and a very practical article by M. P. Vincent ou
a visit to a collection of living softbi 1 Is. Finally, we are glad to
notice that the French Government has appointed a Commission
' to establish on scientific lines for the whole of France a com-
plete classification of useful and harmful birds with the extent
of their usefulness or harmfulness and special mention of those
that might be harmful at one time of year and useful at another.'
The Commission will have much to do to carry out their object,
but it is on the right lines. Bird Protection, except in the case
of species in danger of extermination, should be run 011 economic
lines and not on sentiment, and a careful enquiry is the only
way to determine which species should be protected.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE WHOOPING CRANE.
Sir, --Since writing the note on " Wintering Cranes in New England "
(p. 223) I have some further evidence of the existence of the American
Whooping Crane which a short time ago I thought was either extinct or on
the verge of extinction.
Mr. Charles W. Ward writes me that he saw "altogether about a
dozen Cranes" along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana during February, 1912,
and Mr. Mcllhenny, of Avery Island La., confirms this in a letter to me,
in which he states there are still a few between Vermillion Bay and the
Texas line.
Mr. G. D. Tilley, of Dareiu, Cinn., received one live Whooping Crane
last winter, but I could not find out any details as to the date or place of
capture, nor do I remember where this bird was finally sold.
The above information may be of interest to English aviculturists,
vague as it necessarily is. John C. Phillips.
YOUNG QUEEN ALEXANDRA PARRAKEETS, ETC.
Sir,--I have two more of these hatched from another pair of birds,
There were three, but one died in the nest; why I do not know, for it was
well-grown.
I also have a brood of three young Shamalis, which have left the
nest.
An Orange-headed Ground Thrush has her nest, with three eggs,
built in a small fir tree. The nest resembles a Blackbird's, but is more tidy
outside; the eggs are large for the size of the parent bird, and are a warm
buff, spotted like a Blackbird's egg with rufous, chiefly at the rounded
ends; but I have only just peeped at them.
There is also one young Blue Robin ready to leave the nest.

A fascinating branch of aviculture which has been some-
what neglected of late years, but is now becoming rather popular
where suitable conditions prevail, is the keeping and breeding of
the various species of wild ducks, of which a large and varied
assortment are to be had and will well repay the trouble bestowed
upon them. Ducks have many excellent qualities, they are
mostly very pretty, some are extremely beautiful ; they are,
on the whole, hardy, intelligent and peaceable, and providing
they have space and suitable nesting sites, the majority will
readily breed in confinement.
As to the species of ducks that are to be obtained without
much difficulty, the European kinds may be first mentioned.
Of the surface-feeders, Pintail can generally be obtained at a
very reasonable figure, and the drake is one of the most elegant
of all, but they are not by any means free breeders. Wigeon
and Shovellers are also very showy and will generally breed,
while Teal and Garganey are lovely little birds but shy breeders,
unless they have plenty of space.
Amongst the diving ducks, the Tufted Duck is the most
popular, and should never be omitted from a collection. The
male is most handsome with his plumed head and pure white
sides. Pochards and Scaup are almost equally attractive, and
all spend most of their time in the middle of the pond constantly
diving for their food which consists to a large extent of aquatic
insects, crustaceans and vegetation which exists at the bottom
of the pond.
Amongst foreign species, the Mandarin and Carolina ducks
will always be the most popular, for besides being brilliantly and
beautifully coloured they are hardy and always obtainable, and
the Carolina at least is a very free breeder. Japanese or Baikal
Teal, formerly some of the rarest, have recently become the
commonest foreign ducks on the market. The drake, when in
colour, is nearly as handsome as a Mandarin. When first im-

ported they are very wild indeed, and if turned down on a pond
that is not well fenced in will probably disappear at once. But
they soon become fairly tame. Other beautiful species are the
Chiloe, Wigeon, Bahama Ducks, Chilian Pintail, Red-crested
Pochard, and several very beautiful Teal.
The Tree Ducks form a group by themselves, of which the
White-faced and Fulvous are perhaps the best known. They are
quite hardy and will do well if treated in the same way as the
other ducks, but they are somewhat quarrelsome. I have found,
however, that a pair or two kept with other ducks on a fair-sized
pond will do no harm.
Regarding the conditions that are necessary for the keep-
ing of a collection of ornamental waterfowl. If a large natural
pond, fed by a stream, and surrounded with rushes and grass, is
available, no more suitable place could be found, especially if it
should contain an island or two, and be sheltered from the cold
winds by a belt of trees or rising ground. But such situations
are not always to be found, and it may be necessary to construct
an artificial pond such as those in the Zoological Gardens, where,
in spite of many drawbacks, a large collection of ornamental
waterfowl is maintained.
Space for the ducks to roam on grass is almost as necessary
as the pond itself, for many kinds of ducks are fond of grazing
like Geese, and roaming in search of worms after a shower of
rain. At nesting time also they like to choose their nesting
places, often at considerable distance from the water. So when
planning a place for waterfowl, the larger the area of ground
surrounding the pond the better will the collection thrive.
If the site is much exposed to cold winds some sort of
shelter should be provided in the form of rustic sheds, or shelters
made of rushes tied into bundles and propped up like wheat
shocks.
Rushes and other thick herbage should be encouraged for
shelter and nesting sites, but some ducks prefer to nest within
the shelter of a wooden box or kennel, and several of these
should be provided, the ground forming the bottom, and a hole
just large enough for a duck to enter forming the entrance.
Quite a number of species prefer to nest in boxes or logs at

some height from the ground, and so boxes should be fixed on
stumps from four to six feet high, a rough log leading from the
ground to the entrance.
The enemies that have to be fought against are foxes,
cats, stoats, weasels and rats, and it is well worth while to go to
the expense of a six-foot fence of wire-netting round the whole
enclosure. To make this proof against all furred vermin it must
be of small mesh, say five-eights of an inch. It should be sunk
into the ground for eighteen inches, and then turned outwards
for say twelve inches, and the trench filled in and rammed. At
the top of the fence also the wire should be turned outwards
for two feet, that is, an extra length of wire netting two feet
wide should be wired on to the top of the upright fence and
supported outwards at right angles by means of iron supports
screwed to the upright posts. Such a fence should be practically
vermin proof.
Ducks should be fed twice a day, on a mixture of wheat
and barley, and the quantity given should be just so much as
will be readily consumed. The birds should be taught to come
to the keeper's whistle, and when they are once accustomed to
this they will readily swim towards him when feeding time
comes. If they do not do so it is a sign that they are being
over-fed. In cold weather, a small quantity of barley meal and
chopped boiled liver or bullock's heart is very desirable, and, in
fact, for the diving ducks, unless they are able to obtain a good
deal of natural food, this diet should be given in small quantities
pretty constantly. Bread is also an excellent diet for most ducks,
and stale crusts, thrown into the water will be much appreciated.
As to the procedure in the nesting season. Experience
teaches us that broods left to the parent ducks are rarely reared
successfully on a large pond in a mixed collection. Many young
ducks are extraordinarily independent and will go a great distance
from their parents, thus falling victims to any enemy. It is
always best to take the eggs and entrust them to a reliable hen
to hatch. A cross between a Silkie fowl and some breed of small
bantam makes the most suitable type of hen for the purpose.
The ducks' eggs should be taken any time after the laying of

being determined by the presence of down in the nest.
When the young ducks are hatched they should be left
with the foster hen in the nest for some twenty-four hours, when
they should be transferred with her to a coop, which should be
set out on dry ground in a sunny position. The young ducks
should not be allowed access to water for the first day or two,
especially in the case of the smaller Teal, which are apt to get
their down saturated with water, when they readily catch cold
and die. They need very careful watching for the first week or
so of their lives.
Custard or finely-chopped yolk of egg, mixed with ants'
eggs and biscuit meal or stale bread crumbs forms a good food
for the young ducks. Duckweed is also a necessity and should
always be supplied, at first in very shallow dishes, and after-
wards on a small pond.
Young ducks should not have access to the large duck
pond until they are almost full-grown, but should be reared on
quite small ponds to which no other ducks have access, or they
will take all the food provided for the ducklings. Ducklings
should be pinioned when about a week old, when the operation
is such a slight one that it will cause them no inconvenience.
As they grow older, soaked Canary-seed and finally wheat and
barley should be given. For diving ducklings, such as Pochards
and Tufted Ducks, ground bullock's heart or liver should be
added to the diet after the first fortnight of their lives.

Ruticilia tit vs.
By W. E. Tkschemaker, B.A.
The old- saying--" what's in a name ? " certainly does not
apply to Ornithology, for nomenclature has always been a bone
of contention among ornithologists, and at the present moment
it might be said to be the question of the hour. The origin
of some of the more obscure names of birds is really quite an
interesting study iu itself, that is to say, considered apart from
the vexed question of scientific nomenclature. So let us consider
for a few moments the various names that have been applied to
the present species. " Redstart " of course means " red-tail,"
"start" being obviously the Anglo-Saxon word " steort " ; the
German name " rothschwanz&amp;quot; is an exact equivalent, and also
the Spanish " colirojo&amp;quot; and the Latin " ruticilla.&amp;quot;
In the Linnaeau " motacilla&amp;quot; we have an exact equivalent
to the early English name "quick-start." We seem to have no
equivalent, however, amongst English synonyms, to the German
popular name " hatisrothschwanz " (house-red-tail). We now
come to the name " titys ," which is a bit of a puzzle. Scopoli
wrote " tithys" but he admittedly simply copied the word
(erroneously) from Linnaeus, who spelt it as above. It looks
rather like a proper name extracted from Greek mythology, but
no name at all like it is to be found, except Tityos, the gentle-
man whose liver was perpetually torn by vultures in the nether-
world. What then could Linnaeus have had in his mind when
</bodyText>

294 Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
lie wrote " titys&amp;quot; ? No doubt a mere student of living birds
would give the problem up as a bad job, but an ornithologist
of any eminence is never quite happy unless he is having an
argument and here was an opening. Several gentlemen with
distinguished names thought he meant to write " dies ," a
Greek word meaning 'an avenger' ; but Prof. Newton announced
with conviction that it should read " tiiis,&amp;quot; which originally
meant 'a small chirping bird.' Mr. J. E. Halting, also an
eminent ornithologist, was not at all satisfied with this explana-
tion, and insisted that Linnaeus was thinking of the Greek
adjective " tithos ," which means ' domesticated ' and would have
reference to the bird's habit of perching on houses and nesting
in holes of walls. Then the new school of nomenclature appears
upon the scene and decides that the bird that Linnaeus described
was not a Black Redstart at all but a hen Redstart of venerable age
and somewhat dusky plumage, and that, therefore, the Linnaean
specific name could not stand but must give place to the name
which stood next in chronological order, and that the Black
Redstart must be known for all time by the truly apalling title of
" Phoenic?inis ochrurus gib?altarie?isis.&amp;quot; the first of which epithets
means ' purple-tail ' (a misdescription), the second 'yellow-tail,'
(a contradiction), and the third can hardly be called descriptive,
seeing that, according to Irby, this species is only seen at Gib-
raltar in winter. (I have no quarrel with the new nomenclature,
but at the same time I cannot help thinking that it would have
been far more satisfactory if a really representative international
congress had settled the question for all time by selecting that
name for each species which appeared to them to be most suit-
able. If priority alone is to decide the question we shall often
find ourselves forced to accept a name which may be ungram-
matical, inappropriate, or, as in the above instance, absolutely
meaningless. However, we shall have to judge the system by
its success ; if it succeeds, we shall at all events have uniformity ;
if it fails to secure universal recognition, it will have made con-
fusion worse confounded).
Hartert sketches the range of this species as follows:--
"Europe from Baltic to Mediterranean, east to Roumania and
" Bulgaria. Wintering partly in Europe but mostly in Africa.

"Casual in Scandinavia, once in Finland. Replaced by a nuiu-
" ber of rather different forms in Caucasus, Armenia, Persia,
" Syria, Transcaspia to Turkestan, Altai and Sayan Mountains,
"Central Asia generally and parts of the Himalayas to Tibet and
" Mongolia." It is a regular winter visitor to the south of
England, and especially to the south-western counties. Here
(Teignmouth) the Black Redstart may be occasionally seen on a
sunny winter's day in some sheltered nook of the cliffs--indeed
the first Devonshire (and fifth British) specimen was killed here
in 1S33. Although Witherbv states that " reports of its breed-
ing here are not substantiated " there appears to be fairly good
evidence to that effect. For instance, Bellamy reports an instance
from the neighbourhood of Exeter (Nat. Hist. S. Devon) and
Morris states that he received a nest and eggs from the neigh-
bourhood of Longdon.
But although we are told that the Black Redstart is extend-
ing its range, there is evidence that its visits to this country are
becoming rarer and not more frequent. If anyone doubts this
let him refer to Messrs. D'Urban and Mathew's " Birds of Devon,"
where he will see that in a single week of November, in the year
1843, no less than twenty were killed near Plymouth alone, and
more than twenty in 1850. One gallant gentleman by his own
unaided efforts slew no less than sixteen at Plymouth in Nov.,
1852 ! We may be quite sure that, if the collector could have
had his way, there would not be one single Blackstart upon the
face of the earth to-day, but, happily, two circumstances have
saved it from extermination--the inaccessibility of many of its
breeding-haunts and the protection extended to it in some
countries. The typical site for the nest of this species is perhaps
a crevice in a rocky ravine, high up amongst the Alps, not so
very far below their gleaming summits of eternal snow, and the
fact that the oldest males are to be seen at the highest nesting
stations, whilst the younger males in the grey plumage have to
be content with lower elevations, may be said to show that this
species seeks complete seclusion for its nesting operations. It
is singular, therefore, to find the Black Redstart in a large area of
Central and Southern Europe nesting in barns and sheds in close
proximity to human dwellings, and showing itself boldly in the

Mr. W. E. Teschemakek,
very midst of villages and even towns, from which habit pre-
sumably it derives its German popular name, ' hausrothschwanz.'
Of course, as we know, there are town mice and country mice
and the habits of the town mouse are not those of the country
mouse, but this does not altogether explain the matter to me,
for, in an aviary at all events, the Black Redstart appears to be a
very shy little bird, which never courts attention unless it is
hungry or has some particular request to make. Perhaps the
Black Redstart has an enemy, like our Missel-Thrush, who finds
it safer to rear its young in close proximity to houses--albeit
a very shy bird--in order to avoid the depredations of the
Jackdaw.
As with most other species in my aviary, I was content to
study the habits and requirements of the Black Redstart for several
years before attempting to breed it. In the August number of
the Magazine Dr. Butler has told 11s (unless I have misunderstood
him) that "special knowledge" is not indispensable to the
breeder; if only the latter has "luck," he will wake up some
fine morning to find that he has attained his object without exer-
tion. Without doubt a fluke comes in most usefully at times, but
I fear that the beginner who starts bird-keeping on this principle
will have to wait a long time for any results above the ordinary ;
and, moreover, even if he should secure the desired fluke, he will
probably find the latter very little use to him unless he has
special knowledge Be this as it may, I do not consider the
time I devoted to studying this species wasted. In the first place
I ascertained that the Black Redstart is very deadly in a mixed
community. His colouring is suggestive--black, the garb of night
and of the deeds of darkness, and red, which connotes battle and
bloodshed. If one could only persuade oneself that a'systematic
naturalist ' was likely to know enough about the actual character
of a species, which is but a rare straggler in his country, to
correctly guage its disposition, it vrould be tempting to think
that Linnaeus really meant to write " tites&amp;quot; (instead of " titys&amp;apos; , &amp;apos;) y
for the Black Redstart is indeed an " Avenger." I once received
from one of our lady members a pair of hand-reared Blue-Tits,
which would perch on one's shoulder as soon as one entered the
aviary, begging for a mealworm. One day, whilst they were in

this position, they suddenly cowered in evident alarm without
any apparent cause except perhaps a small dark shadow which
passed overhead. A few days later those Blue-Tits lay still
and stiff. Then I thought of that dark shadow : it was the
shadow of Tites, the Avenger: But I could never catch Tites
at his deadly work, for Tites is an assassin, subtle, stealthy and
secret.
I also noted that the Black Redstart delights to lurk in the
darkest corner--a ledge under and close to the roof by prefer-
ence--and decided that that would be the best position for the
nest-box. I made several experiments to determine the best
form for the latter, one being after the model of a chalet and
quite ornamental, but the only one that seemed to attract was
the simple box with an opening at the top, which may be seen
in the photo. I also made many experiments with different
forms of insect food and came to the conclusion that it would
not be difficult to rear the young.
Having decided that it would be worth while giving the
species a trial, the next thing was to look round for a breeding
hen, the one that I had not being of the required type. One
was sent me the same autumn which looked very promising, and
the following spring I caught up this bird and the old male
(whom we will call Tites) and placed them temporarily in an
empty cage in the bird-room whilst I cleared out a few birds
from the smaller aviary to which I intended to transfer them.
But the Fates were against me that day. The housemaid, who
feeds my birds, discovered them and thought that I had forgotten
to feed them : when I returned I found an open door and Tites
in sole possession of that cage.

THE TRANSPORT OF BIRDS.

By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
As the cleverest aviculturist that ever lived cannot breed
from birds that he has not got, the question of transport may fairly
claim to be the most important in aviculture ; it is chiefly the
difficulties herein involved that account for the backward state
of our science compared with the sister pursuit of horticulture.
If one could transport birds in the egg as easily as plants in the
seed, how things would have boomed by this time!
The chief difficulties in transporting birds arise from the
necessity of very close confinement, and the inevitable altera-
tions of temperature that have to be faced. The latter cannot
be entirely obviated, but travelling-cages might be a great deal
better made than one often sees them ; in fact, I think bad pack-
ing is responsible for a great deal of failure in bird transport.
In a travelling-cage for long distances the room must be
secured by depth and breadth ; no more height should be allowed
than is necessary to give the occupants head-room when standing
erect on the floor or perch ; and the perches should only be just
so high above the floor as to ensure a bird not being jammed if
it tries to creep beneath them.
Of course one is familiar with cages of this pattern from
those used by continental dealers ; but for a long journey the
floor question becomes important. Wet dirt is the great trouble
to contend with in taking birds a long distance in a small space ;
the terror of germs is, I think, made too much of, but plastered
plumage and clogged feet are serious matters.
In bird importing, before everything else, one ought to
" hope for the best and expect the worst." One should clean
out the small travelling cages daily, and put in fresh sand or
sawdust, but the chances are that one will not have the oppor-
tunity, owing to sea-sickness, awkward storage, or other causes ;
or, in the more probable case of the birds being sent in the
charge of someone else, that someone may lack the will as well
as the power to give daily attention in the matter of cleaning.
If the birds get fed daily, that is a mercy to be grateful for.
Moreover, sawdust and sand may be unattainable at the time

and place, for opportunities of taking good birds out or home
do not always come just when one is prepared for them.
Therefore I recommend using the barred floor over a draw-
tray or board, as with this the cleaning becomes a matter of less
urgent importance. The principle is used in parrots' cages,
ships' hen-coops and in our poultry-fattening coops here, as well
as in the admirable Chinese transport cages, and it seems strange
it has not spread further.
There is an idea about, I think, that barred floors will hurt
a bird's feet, but this is entirely erroneous. Of course the bars
should have sharp edges rounded off, and if this is done, even
waterfowl, which are, naturally, tenderer-footed than laud birds,
will travel all right on such a floor. Indeed, it is far more
natural for them, or for any birds, to tread on more or less
yielding bars with uneven pressure on the foot, than on a hard
level board, which is particularly apt to give corns.
For such birds as parrots, which will gnaw through wood,
the floor-bars must be wire or wire-netting, but otherwise wood
should be used, though I have seen Toucans and Tanagers im-
ported in fine condition on a wire-netting floor.
It may also be objected that such a floor is never quite
clean. That is true, but neither is a solid floor in a small ship-
board cage, even if cleaned daily ; and at any rate there is no
danger of thick clogging dirt, which is what is really serious.
The width of the spaces between the bars or of the netting-
mesh should be about an inch for birds of a pigeon's size or
over, and half-an-inch for canary-sized birds, and so 011.
The one drawback of this method is that if the food is
spilled on the floor, the birds may go unfed for a long time, if the
mesh of the grating be too small or the height above the draw-
tray too great, to enable them to reach the spilled food.
But then this should not happen ; one very essential point
in bird-transport is so to fasten the feeding and drinking vessels
that they cannot be upset by any possibility. Of course many
birds will throw out their food themselves, but a deep feeding-
vessel, with narrowed top, will obviate this to a great extent.
All feeding-vessels should be made so as to be accessible from
the front and should go inside.

Mr. Frank Finn,
The Chinese transport-cages seem to me to be the most
perfect form that has been devised for a hot climate at all events.
They are made of split bamboo, remarkably true, though without
a single nail in them. Top, sides and bottom are all of this work,
with a draw-tray below. There are three sliding doors, one in
the middle and one at each end, so that birds can be run from
one cage to another without handling, and at the bottom of the
front are two tiny doors, one at each end, to allow of slipping in
troughs for food and water. The perches, three in a high cage
and two in a flat one, are fixed immovably by having one of the
bars let through a hole in the end during the process of con-
struction, and do not cross, but run from end to end.
The only fault in the cage, is in fact, that thus the end of
the perches conies over the food and water. This of course
should be avoided, but in practice I have found birds thrive
extraordinarily well in these cages, which are commonly used in
Calcutta as store cages by the dealers, who keep stock in them
for months together, and that in a fiendishly hot climate.
The usual size is about two feet long. Some are square in
section, others flat; the latter are of course best for shipping,
and I have seen such different birds as Canaries and Japanese
Teal thriving in cages of the same pattern, the perches being of
course removed in the latter case.
Ground-birds do not need perches during transport, even
if, like Pheasants and some ducks, they perch occasionally, unless
the cage is a high one, which will seldom be found possible.
Perching-birds, being always on the jump, need perches even
when on a barred floor, but these should.always be put so as not
to cross, and it is well to have one thick and the other thin,
where two are used, to afford a change of grip. Of course the
drawback to a cane cage is that it affords no protection from
weather and vermin. If, therefore, it cannot be hung out of the
reach of rats and cats, it will have to be enclosed in a case with a
hinged front of wire ; and in this case it will be very likely
thought as well to make a box cage while one is about it.
The front of such a cage is best made of strong wire gauze
of a quarter-inch mesh ; if netting is used, two layers should be
put on, separated by corks, which will bid any vermin defiance.

Ants, however, may give trouble, and must be combated by
applications of Kerosene.
Except in the cases of such birds as swans and geese,
which are not nervous and not likely to hurt anyone, it is most
inadvisable to have cages with wide bars permitting birds to get
their heads out. I have actually seen this advised for herons,
storks and cranes--all birds with most dangerous beaks and the
will to use them ! Where birds can be allowed the use of such
open fronts, the food and water are of course best put outside.
With regard to packing, the best rule to follow is the
feu r er birds the better. Sociable birds are of course best kept
in pairs, or at least in two's, if of the very cuddlesome sort that
chums up with anything; very spiteful ones must of course be
kept singly, and may need solid instead of barred partitions.
But however sociable birds are, every effort should be made to
keep as few together as possible, so as to give the maximum
amount of room to each individual and to avoid the danger of
crushing or trampling if they are frightened, and the fouling of
floor, perches, food, and water.
Importation in bulk, lam inclined to think, has something
to do with the curious fact that a rare species, which necessarily
comes over a few at a time, is so often easier to keep than a
common one which arrives by the hundreds.
Of course soft-bills make much more mess than hard-bills,
and so cannot be packed so many together--or at any rate should
not be ; the dirtiest of all birds are fish-eaters and honey-suckers.
In the case of these last care must be taken to see that they do
not mess themselves up with their liquid food, which should
therefore be served to them in a vessel with a lid, perforated with
holes to admit their beaks. Water-vessels should be arranged so
that the birds cannot splash in them ; unless the cage is very
large, so that a bath can be put in in calm warm weather, the
luxury of washing had better be dispensed with for the voyage.
This applies particularly to waterfowl, for unless they can bathe
regularly and properly they get miserably draggled ; water does
not "roll off a duck's back" if that duck has been short of
bathing accommodation of late.

Terpsiphone paradisea ajjinis.
By E. C. Stuart Baker, F.L.S., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.
I fear that my experiences respecting the keeping of this
most beautiful little Flycatcher in captivity will not be of much
assistance to those who wish to do the same, for my captive was
almost as free as its brethren of the woods and forests.
It was brought to me at Gungong in N. Cachar by some
Nagas in the early Autumn, September to be exact, of 18S6 and
had evidently been kept by them for some months, for the string
attached to the tarsus was worn quite smooth next the leg and the
latter had a distinct mark all round where it had been rubbed and
healed. It was kept in the way so many birds are kept in India,
that is to say, fastened by the leg to a small perch over which
was fastened a loop of bamboo by which it could be carried
and at either end of which was placed a small bamboo cup for
food and water.
It was quite tame when it arrived and greedily took flies,
grasshoppers, etc. from the Naga who owned it, flying on to his
wrist or holding on to the sheet by which his body was covered.
The enormous sum of one shilling and fourpence transferred the
ownership to myself and my first act was to promptly cut off the
string and let the bird loose in a small outdoor aviary, about 6ft.
by 4ft. by 6ft., when he at once flew to a perch, preened his
feathers and commenced to call for more food.
I soon found that imprisonment was unnecessary for the
little chap except at night. Within three days of his arrival he
would eat out of my hands through the wire netting of his cage,
following me from one side to another as I passed round it. Then
I tried entering the cage and after his first fright at this novel
manoeuvre he promptly alighted on my head and then scrambled
down on to my arm where he stayed and picked up some flies I
had brought for him from the palm of my other hand. Two or
three days after this I ventured to take him out of his cage into
the open and he followed me round occasionally flitting into the
air but sitting most of the time on my shoulder eating, as I
caught grasshoppers for him. He made no attempt to fly away

although his native jungles were in sight all the time and indeed
he did but little flying, contenting himself with letting me
do the catching of the insects whilst he did the eating. When,
however, I wanted him to go back into his cage as darkness
approached I found he was very firm in his refusal to enter
therein and it was not until I got him some chopped fowl's liver
and put it inside that he consented to go in. Before long I gave
up shutting him in his cage at all and then, finding I did not
insist upon it, he generally went in on his own accord at roosting
time and all I had to do was to see that the fastenings were
closed.
After he had been with me for a couple of months I wanted
the cage for some Erythropus avmrensis and so Mr. Flycatcher
had to give up his sleeping compartment and thence forward he
slept in mine, generally selecting the rung of my towel horse or
the edge of a picture as his perch. At the same time he entirely
disapproved of his cage being given up to the Kestrels and
would often fly up against the wires, cursing the inmates in the
most awful bird language until he thought he had really fright-
ened them badly, when he would come back to my shoulder and
condescend to eat anything I caught for him.
His voice, when swearing at the Kestrels and sometimes
when annoyed for other reasons, was very loud and harsh, often
almost a scream, but he had quite a pretty little song in the
spring and often used to whistle away to me in the mornings and
evenings.
He was distinctly a lazy bird and always preferred sitting
on my head, shoulders or arms and eating what I caught for him
to flying about and catching insects for himself, and it was
months before I could get him to earn his own livelihood, and
always he was ready with an excuse for letting someone do the
hard work for him.
Butterflies he disdained but he enjoyed grasshoppers,
caterpillars, woodlice, grubs and beetles and, above all, houseflies
and for these latter he would always exert himself. Perhaps,
however, even more than house flies or anything else living he
enjoyed little tit-bits of fowl's liver raw, and it was very pretty to
see him swooping up off a chair-back, high up, almost to the

Mr. E. C. Stuart Baker,
ceiling, as I threw up pieces of liver for him to catch. He was a
magnificent catch, and would have been worth playing in the
slips in any test match, but he was not nearly as quick as a tame
Drongo I kept at the same time and when both were in the same
room together I had always to throw the Drongo a piece first and
whilst he was after it, throw a piece for the Flycatcher in the
opposite direction.
It was a very beautiful sight to see the two birds in the air
at once; the Drongo, a specimen of the Lesser Racquet-tailed
species (.Bringa remifet ) with glistening coal black plumage and
the snowy white Flycatcher, both with their beautiful tail feathers
streaming out behind them. The Drongo seemed to feel no
inconvenience from his tail feathers when turning and twisting
in the air, but the Flycatcher, who eventually developed four
magnificent central tail feathers, always seemed to find these a
handicap when he wanted to turn suddenly. Flying straight
ahead, the beautiful white streamers floated out behind him like
waving banners, curving gracefully with each dip of the bird's
rising and falling flights: but when he wanted to dodge on one
side they caught the wind and checked his speed quite visibly.
When I obtained my Paradise Flycatcher he was a little
red brown bird evidently of that season, confirming the story of
the Nagas to the effect that they had but taken him from the nest
the preceding May. Even then he was a pretty bird. The whole
forehead and crown were black gradually shading into grey on
the chin, throat and upper breast and into the same colour on the
nape, though there it was darker and more glossy. The rest of his
plumage colour was a bright dark chestnut, the quills of the
wing darker and browner on the concealed portions. Below the
whole surface was a ruddy orange, the centre of the abdomen
and vent being almost white. The next year the bird acquired
two long centre tail feathers, but these were red as in the adult
female, though he also assumed the black head of the adult male
and his lower parts turned an almost pure white. In the third
year he still retained the chestnut upper tail coverts and also a
good many chestnut feathers in the wing-coverts and scapulars
and it was not until he was in his fourth year, or a little over
three years old, that he attained the full snow-white glory of the

adult bird, with four long white tail feathers, black shafted and
black edged.
I think the Eastern sub-species, affinis, is a more beautiful
bird than the Western form, Terpsiphoneparadisea paiadisea,w\wc\\
has no black markings or black shafts to the feathers. The
border of mourning seems to add to the intense whiteness of the
rest of the plumage and make it contrast even more vividly with
the velvet black head and neck.
Probably the Burmese Paradise Flycatcher also has the
tail feathers next the central rectrices more often, and moie
fully, developed than the Indian form in which it is rare to find
more than the central pair lengthened.
Their habits, too, are rather different, for T. p. paradisea
is principally found haunting and breeding in Mango Groves or
other groves of big trees, with little or no undergrowth, whereas
T. p. affinis is undoubtedly a bird principally of the bamboo
jungle, though it may also be found in dense evergreen forest and
equally often in the secondary growth which springs up directly
laud cleared in virgin forests and cultivated, is once more allowed
to lapse into wildness.
Undoubtedly from a picturesque point of view, the deep
green foliage of the huge Mango trees forms the best background
to the whiteness of this bird's plumage, against which it flickers
and shimmers in flight like sotue weighty tuft of gossamer
blown along in the sunlight. Against the dull pale yellow of the
bamboo jungle the bird is hardly noticeable, unless, as is rarely
the case, it flies high enough to get against the green tops
instead of flitting in and out amongst the yellow stems.
After I had had him with me for about eighteen months, I
got my white dandy a little red iuate of a wife and they soon palled
up and became quite a devoted couple, but they never shewed
the slighest inclination to build or undertake the cares of a
family, though she dropped one or two eggs on the floor of
her aviary; for she, alas! was never tame like her husband,
and had to be kept always in a cage, but it was a large
one, well fitted with suitable places for building, a clump of
pigmy Bamboos, living and thriving in a pot in a corner of her
home. I never saw the male posturing or displaying in the cage

before his wife but lie would do so sometimes in the spring when
I was taking him round with me in the early morning.
On these occasions he always launched himself forth into
the air off my head, and then, after flying a few yards would fluff
himself out until he looked like a snowy powder-puff with a
long-tail, and would gradually sink with extended tail and wings
until within a few feet of the ground when he would rise again
with rapid beats of his wings and then either repeat the same
trick or else fly straight back to me and once more absorb himself
in the business of his life--eating.
For his size he was a very greedy bird, and he never seemed
really satisfied during daylight and he certainly ate four times the
bulk of stuff in a day that his wife did, but he kept wonderfully
well until I left him to go home, and then in my absence he fell
a prey to a tame Civet cat that had, during my presence, always
declared Paradise Flycatchers to be rank poison to it.
The nests of these Flycatchers are very beautiful ; deep
little cups of fine grasses and bents, neatly and compactly inter-
twisted with one another, and ornamented freely outside with
lichen, moss, caterpillar's cocoons, and with copious spider's
webbing. Generally they are placed in a small vertical fork of a
Bamboo or a small branch of a tree, in the case of typica most
often of a Mango tree, but now and then one may be found in a
horizontal fork. Always, however, they are very firmly fixed in
and attached to the supports with the spider webs as well as
incorporated in the materials of the body of the nest.
The full complement of eggs laid is four, hardly ever five,
and almost equally, hardly ever three.
They are extremely beautiful eggs varying in ground
colour from almost pure white, merely tinged with salmon or
pink, to a warm, deep pink or salmon colour. The markings
consist of specks, spots and blotches of red, reddish brown and
reddish grey with a very few secondary spots of lilac or neutral
tint, these being sometimes practically absent. As a rule they
are disposed in an indefinite ring about the larger end, sometimes
as cap and still less often sparsely scattered over the larger two-
thirds of the egg.
As a rule the paler the ground colour the more definite the

markings, not only in contrast thereto, but in actual fact. Many
of the deeper tinted pink ones only have the markings visible as
a faint indefinite ring.
In shape the eggs are a broad obtuse oval ; the texture is
very fine and close, and the surface smooth and sometimes rather
glossy, but the shell is fragile and brittle in proportion to the
size of the egg. This, the size, averages 75 ft. by -56 ft. for
one hundred eggs.
They breed principally in April and May, but I have seen
eggs laid the last week in March and again as late as the last
week in August.
Gungong, North Cachar, where my birds lived, was about
two thousand, five hundred feet above sea level, but Paradisi
typica is common all over the plains nearly, and Paradisi a,finis
certainly is found up to four thousand feet, if not higher. They
are easy birds to feed, easy to tame and are patient of changes of
temperature so they should not be difficult to keep even in the
climatic variety show called England. I11 point of beauty there
are few birds they do not excel and if some of their notes are
harsh and discordant, some are quite pleasant and might almost
be called beautiful.

The need of fresh air for birds, even those of hot countries,
is now so well recognised that the few remarks I have to make
here are merely added testimony to the fact that birds cannot
live long or remain healthy without it. Even in the cold of our
Northern climate I have found that so-called delicate birds, such
as the Tanager, the Dhyal Bird of India, the Rock Thrush and
Blue Thrush, can be hardened to bear the ordinary cold of an
English winter and spring (but not a very bitter North or East
wind, nor a cold fog) provided they have a shelter to retire to.
Of course, great care has to be taken during moulting. It would
be interesting to try a very gradual acclimatisation of tropical
birds in England, in pure fresh air, and making use of every ray
of sunshine.

Just now, my Indian Dhyal Bird and "American Robin"
(Turdus migraiorius&amp;apos;) are vying with the Song-Thrushes in loud,
clear singing ; for they are out all day long flying about in their
lawn aviaries, in perfect health, and enjoying their cold baths,
in the March sleet showers and gleams of sunshine, while the
Cambazan Turtle-Doves-- out all the year round--are preparing
to nest. The Dhyal Bird seems to sing the louder during the
cold of Spring, when the great icy r hail-clouds come drifting
over the blue sky.
A short time ago I had a Blue Thrush that came to me in
a sorry plight, and unable to moult properly. He was old and
looked very miserable. I kept him indoors for a couple of weeks,
in a room with the window almost always wide open, and gave
him a tepid bath every day. Then his cage was moved into a
South verandah, on to a table against the wall of the house,
well protected at one end and over the top. At first he stayed
under his shelter, then he hopped out and ventured into his bath
for a moment or two. After a week he was able to stay out all
day long, new feathers appeared--some white ones among them
-- and he began to utter some very sweet, loud notes, clear as a
bell. His wits were considerably sharpened through being in
the fresh air, and he had many engaging little ways. If he
wanted a mealworm or more food (for he was voracious) he looked
about for a little stone which he dropped into his drinking glass
or he lifted up the latter in his beak and threw it down.
A Rock Thrush I had for many years lived out of doors,
winter and summer, and his song and plumage were marvellously
beautiful. The American Robin one very cold day lately opened
the door of his cage and flew out. I placed his cage in the
verandah and hoped for the best, but Spring is rather a fatal
time in which to lose birds.
He flew all over the garden, into the orchard, over to a
neighbouring garden, and late in the afternoon returned to the
verandah and flew into his cage ! It was home to him.

Mr. Page is too well known an Aviculturist to need any
introduction to our readers and a book by such an authority on
practical Aviculture is bound to contain a mass of information
from which all of us can learn something. I11 the introductory
chapter we are pleased to see that he lays great stress on the
necessity of keeping a " Log-book " in which an accurate record
of the doings of the birds may be daily entered up. This most
important part of Aviculture is, we fear, sadly neglected. When
birds are wild, and more especially in the less civilised regions of
the world, it is almost impossible to devote the time and patience
necessary to careful observations of their habits, we have not yet
become sufficiently educated to prefer our collectors to bring
back a well-filled diary rather than a well-filled bag, and thus the
only source from which we may learn the courting and nesting
habits of many species is from Aviculture. Many beginners may
feel at a loss what to record about their pets, but in future such
an excuse will be of no avail for the whole matter is carefully set
out in the present volume. A large chapter is devoted to Aviaries,
abundantly illustrated with photographs, many of these Aviaries
will be beyond the means of most Aviculturists to copy, but
smaller and more modest Aviaries are also portrayed as well
as minute practical details of how they should be built and the
approximate cost.
The rest of the book is devoted to different classes of birds
and their needs in captivity, and a list of the main genera is given
together with the English name of a well known species with
which most readers are likely to be familiar. Roughly speaking,
only the Passeres or small birds such as Finches, Thrushes, Fly-
catchers, Tanagers, Starlings, Toucans, Hornbills, Birds of Para-
dise, etc. are dealt with in detail and the larger birds merely
touched upon in the last three chapters. The author has evi-
dently been pressed for space, but we feel that in a general book
such as this some of the detail and classification might have been

Last year there came into existence, somewhat on the lines
of the Avicultural Society, the Amateur Menagerie Club, and
they have recently issued in a neat little volume their first Year
Book. This contains illustrated articles of various animals such
as Park Cattle, Notes on British Mustelines, Monkeys, British
Wild Cat, Sheep, Ostriches, Chamaelons and Reptiles.
It also contains the Rules of the Club and the winners of
the Club's Medals. The medals are awarded yearly (r) for success-
fully breeding the animal, bird or reptile, which is rarest and
most difficult to breed, and (2) for importing and keeping alive
for at least three months, the animal, bird or reptile which is
rarest and most difficult to keep in captivity. The Objects of the
Club are (1) to encourage the keeping of wild animals, (2) to help
members with advice, (3) to circulate among members a list of
animals for sale. We have much pleasure in wishing this Club
a long and prosperous career, which, if it receives the support it
deserves, should be assured and any of our members who would
care to know more about it, should communicate with the
Secretary, Mr. G. Tyrwhitt Drake, Cobtree Manor, Maidstone.

shown in the plate which accompanies&amp;apos; the article, but the speci-
mens figured are apt to be misleading as while the British example
is in full summer plumage, the Continental one shows a lot of
colour on the head and neck, a sign of immaturity or winter
plumage. With this number the Editors, as previously announced,
insist on the International Rules of Nomenclature being adhered
to and all our native birds now appear under their new cogno-
men's ; as a result of this a serious source of error is likely to
creep in since almost every bird is recorded under a trinomial,
even if the bird is only seen and not handled and there are few
races that can be identified with certainty in the field.
The article in the July number is a translation of Sibbald's
Prodromus published in 1684; the original being written in
obscure and somewhat involved Latin. Mr. Mullen's translation
of this interesting work is very acceptable. A review of Mr.
Eagle Clarke's recent work on Migration forms the article of the
August number.
All the numbers contain, as usual, a large number of short
notes relating chiefly to the occurence, or nesting of rare and
local species. _
THE EMUA
In the April number of The Emu, Mr. McLean continues
his most interesting account of the Bush birds of New Zealand,
illustrated by some photographs of the typical haunts of the birds
as well as of their nests and eggs. Mr. Whitlock sends a further
account of his zoological researches in the Stirling Ranges,W.A.,
also illustrated by some excellent photographs. Among the many
other shorter articles and notes we may specially notice as being
of interest to Aviculturists the acclimatization in one or two
districts of the beautiful White Torres Strait Pigeon ( Myristicivora
spilorrhoa). This bird which is seldom (if ever) imported into this
country should make a very suitable aviary inmate and seems to
be quite hardy. At Brisbane and at Herberton, N.Z. they have
complete liberty and do not appear to wander far from where they
have been turned out.

CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
THE WHOOPING CRANE [Grus americana).
Sir,--I n the present, and previous, issue of the Avicultuial Magazine?
mention has been made of this most beautiful creature, and it occurred to
me that a photograph and a few words of praise would not be out of place,,
and would perhaps be welcomed by lovers of Natural History.
In the first place, it is most gratifying to hear that a small flock of
them has been seen lately in their native home, and that they are not yet
exterminated, as we were under the impression that the few in confinement
were the only living ones left.
The photograph gives a good idea of the bird in this collection.
Purchased fully adult in December 1S92, it still looks as strong and well
as ever, and is one of the most sociable creatures one could wish for ;
being very tame and always ready to take food from the hand. It welcomes
yon with a graceful bow, and weather conditions make no difference to it.
I suspect it to be a female, since it is constantly in close companionship
with a male Canadian Crane (Grus canadensis ), but, as the bird has never
attempted to nest, one cannot be certain.
When showing off it stands upright and then takes very slow, long
majestic steps, until it reaches its imagined enemy ; after taking a good
look it turns round and regains its former position to seek for other objects
which may require inspection. The call note is quite different from that
of any other Crane, being much more musical, and not nearly so loud as
some of the other species of Crane. R- Cosgrave.

THE FEEDING OF LORIES.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9975486" page_id="32659475"  page_num="313" year="" vol="">
Sir, -- From time to time I have sent a few notes to the Avicultural
Magazine on the feeding of Lories, and I believe my method of mixing
barley water with the milk, whether fresh or condensed, has been followed
by several other keepers of these birds with good results.
Recently I have been trying another method of feeding, and, from
the results obtained, I think I am justified in reporting it to the members
of the .Society.
Marmite sop made with barley water, sweetened, and a little sponge
cake added is the food I have been trying. The idea of using Marmite sop
was given me by a Member of the Avicultural Society, but as a food for a
different class of bird.
The advantages of Marmite over milk are that there is no risk of the
food going sour in the hottest weather, and fresh fruit can be safely given.
The suitability of this food for Lories was brought to my notice in
the following ways : -- In the first instance, I had reason to place a Red-
crowned Hanging Parrakeet into the same aviary with a Fruit Sucker that
was getting Marmite sop, and I soon noticed a great improvement in the
Loricul&amp;apos;us. On another occasion I placed a pair of Lories that were not
looking well into an aviary containing Tanagers and a Fruit Sucker. The
Lories soon forsook their milk sop for the Marmite and are now looking
better than I have ever seen them. A third instance was an Eos fuscata
that I thought was certainly going to die. The diet of this bird had been
changed from fresh milk to condensed milk and then to a malted milk
but without any good results. As a last resort Marmite sop was tried and
the bird is now as well as possible.
All my Tanagers, Fruit .Suckers and Sugar Birds get some of the sop
and the Sun Birds get a little in their Horlick's Milk, with first-class
results. I think from this that Marmite is a wholesome food for honey-
eating birds, and probably an improvement on the usual milk diet.

Sir, --I should like to inquire whether avian tuberculosis is a common
disease with Cranes. The disease is of course very rare in this country, but
I lost two birds from it (a mated pair of Demoiselle Cranes) last spring. I
had had these birds myself for about two years, and it seems as if they
must have had the disease during this whole period.
There is no question about the diagnosis as the livers of the birds
were carefully examined by a well-known pathologist at the Harvard
Pathological Laboratory. John C- Phillips.

I have been asked to contribute suggestions for keeping
some of the Game Birds, founded upon my own experience, to
form part of the " Practical Notes &amp;quot; which, for some months, have
been a useful feature in our Magazine. Valuable papers have
from time to time appeared in past numbers, relating to the

this extensive order, notably, Mr. Seth-Smith&amp;apos;s upon the Ouails
and Hemipodes, and as I do not wish to go over old ground, I
will confine myself in the main either to such species as are less
often kept, or in the Management of which special difficulties
appear to have presented themselves.
As a preliminary, I would remark that, in the Management
of Birds of this Order, much will depend upon the character of
the soil upon which the birds are to be kept.
Many of the difficulties which beset the aviculturist who
aspires to keep the more tender species, disappear if he is so
fortunate as to possess aviaries or enclosures upon a light soil,
in the composition of which sand and gravel predominate.
This applies more particularly to aviaries. In these the birds
necessarily 'work' the same piece of ground very intensely--
Especially up and down the boundaries, whether of wire netting
or other material, they are apt to make runs and paths wdiich,
if the soil be stick)&amp;apos;, seriously affects the beauty of their plumage.
It is a sad sight to see a fine Reeves or Amherst Pheasant trailing
his train feathers in the mud as he fidgets up and down the fence
cf his run.
When I was experimenting with Partridges, with a view
of getting them to lay in pens (for sporting purposes) on a system
elaborated on a shooting in Central France, I found that one
feature was that the pens should be circular, with no angle, and
with the bushes or other cover in the centre and open space all
round. This tended to check this habit of restlessly running up
and down, turning always at the same spot, a very important
point if the captive be a long-tailed pheasant, who often treads
upon his own tail as he turns at a right-angled corner.
If I were ever to keep pheasants in aviaries or small pens
I should certainly make the fence of the runs, where the birds
chiefly take their exercise, round, or half-moon shape. Their
plumage would certainly last much better, and the extra trouble
involved would be well repaid, especially where the soil was
strong.
But to keep some game-birds in health, not only is a
light soil desirable, but ample space is absolutely essential.
Capercaillies, for instance, and to a lesser degree, Blackgame,

must have abundance of room. They want plenty of clean
ground to range over, with dense cover at hand to which they
can retire, so as to feel absolutely safe.
I think an adult wild-caught Capercaillie is about the most
difficult subject to deal with that I have encountered. He will
not stand close confinement at all, and must as soon as possible
be enlarged. The difficulty then is to prevent his being starved
in the midst of plenty, for it is of no use to put food down where
he dare not venture to get it. Hand-reared Capercaillies are
seldom to be had, and it may be taken for granted that a wild-
caught bird will not for a considerable time ever leave the thick
cover, of which there must be plenty, for many yards.
The grain (oats, peas, wheat, barley and a little maize)
must be thrown down with the grit along the outside of the
bushes, the pine branches stuck into the ground and the water-
pens replenished, then the feeder should slip away and the birds
must be left absolutely quiet. It is of course a great thing if
some tame birds are already in the enclosure, as they will inspire
confidence in the new comer. I found it useful to fit up a
"hide " into which one could get, so that one could judge how
the birds were going on, but the screen must be a good one,
and one must never be detected in it, or when leaving. In time
Capercaillies will tame, and are always most interesting; but a
particularly fine old cock was here almost three years before he
would come out into the open to feed in our presence. It was
a fine sight then to see him in the spring slowly walking round
his hens, at feeding time, with tail spread and wings lowered
and neck-frill standing out stiff. My Capercaillies and Black-
cocks called freely in the spring, but I never saw anything that
might be called a " Lek " in any special place ; perhaps because
the birds were pinioned and the number of hen birds small.
Although my enclosure is roomy (nearly four acres) I could not
keep more than one, or at the most two, Capercaillie cocks,
owing to their pugnacity. Blackgame are not quite so shy and
do not require so much space. But neither will they live long
in such runs as suit ordinary pheasants well. I recollect the
late Lord Lilford telling me that, with all his experience, he
had never been able to keep Capercaillies, and that only in one

year did his Blackgame really thrive, and that was when they
had the run of a large walled-iu kitchen garden. This suited the
birds admirably, but their ravages among the strawberries and
green vegetables were so serious that the experiment could not
be repeated.
All Game-birds that I have kept, including Grouse, have
taken readily to Mangel-Wurzel roots, and during the winter and
early spring months they are a most valuable food. But in
frosty weather they must not be left out at night, or must be
rolled under some dense bush, so that they do not get frozen.
Coarse and fine grit and plenty of water are necessities to all
Game-birds. In my enclosure there happens to be a clear
running stream, which of course is a great advantage as it
prevents the possibility of soiled drinking pans. Capercaillies
and Blackgame feel the heat of summer, as might be expected,
and must have plenty of shade. My Blackgame roosted in long
grass near the stream, but the Capercaillies perch. Being heavy
birds, when pinioned they are apt to injure themselves it dis-
turbed from their roosting-places or while coming down in the
mornings. It is advisable, therefore, to take off the lower
branches of bushes or trees which may tempt them up to
dangerous heights; and only leave such bushes and lower trees
as are safe accessible to them. I once had a Capercaillie cock
killed owing to a stranger passing under his tree and causing
him to fly oft his perch after dusk. My Capercaillie hens
generally made their nests, as they so often do in the wild state,
against the bole of a tree. They cover their eggs,and so cleverly
do they conceal the nest that once a Capercaillie hen, by scraping
out a hollow, managed to prevent us from finding her nest on
perfectly bare ground under a beech tree, till one day we un-
expectedly found her incubating.
Keepers sometimes advance a theory that grey hens do not
lay till the third summer after they are hatched. Long ago I
had clear evidence that this is not correct in regard to Caper-
caillies, and it seemed unlikely that their smaller relatives would
be slower to attain maturity. But since I have kept Blackgame
I found that they too will breed in their second summer. I
believe the reason why so consideiable a proportion of grey hens

is sometimes seen without young is that, while the birds seeks
damp rushy places to nest in, the chicks are exceptionally
delicate, and their survival greatly depends upon the sort of
weather which they have to face during the first week or two
of their lives.
Redgrouse have been often kept in a half-tame condition,
and more than once in recent years they have been bred in
confinement. This has always I think been achieved in places
where a supply of heather was available to augment their food.
But I have no heather within reach, and my Grouse had to be
content with meal, green stuff and bird seed (Canary and hemp),
with such grass and clover as the)&amp;quot; found in their enclosure. I
had a hen Grouse for over three years, which during that time
never saw heather. Her habits of course altered considerably
under such artificial conditions. She would, in wet weather,
roost on a lower branch of a box tree, and I have seen her
busily breaking up and eating an acorn.
Grouse are charming pets, and the cocks become almost
troublesomelv bold and aggressive. A full-winged tame cock
Grouse that I used to know on Spey-side would fly in the face of
any stranger in the spring-time.
I always expected that Willow-Grouse, from living on a
more varied diet, would be more easily managed than the British
Red Grouse, and when I obtained a small lot in 1908 I found
this was certainly the case. We never had the slightest diffi-
culty in keeping them, as they would eat all that a Red-Grouse
would take, and, in addition, Birch, Sallow and Beech, foliage
and twig ends. Though wild-cauglit birds, sent direct from
Sweden, they would, in about three weeks time, run towards
one at feeding time. My first birds all proved to be hens,
but, nevertheless, four out of the six laid the first summer.
The following spring I succeeded in getting some cocks ; but,
afterwards, though we hatched young, and a pair which I pre-
sented to the Zoological Gardens reared a small brood, a severe
visitation of "gapes" not only prevented any further success
that season, but obliged me, much against my inclination, to
give up keeping any more of the Grouse family.

Enquiry on Grouse Disease, some 2,000 birds were dissected, and
only in three examples were gape-worms (Syngamus trachealis )
found; yet as the Committee report: "This freedom from the
common pest of the Fowl-yard and the Pheasant coop is due to
the free and unconfined life of the Grouse, together with the
comparative paucity of earthworms on the Moor." That the
above explanation is probably quite correct my experience shows,
for in captivity I have found Grouse and their allies exception-
ally subject to the parasite. For several years in succession, the
"gapes" first affected the birds of the Grouse family in my
collection; Grouse and Willow - Grouse, Blackgame, Caper-
caillies, then Partridges, Pheasants, Impeyaus and Tragopans
(I place the names in order of susceptibility), and finally it
spread to other species including Bustards and the young of
two species of Crane. In the cold weather we had no difficulty
in keeping all these species in health, but with the warmth and
drought of summer, in spite of free use of quicklime, etc., the
pest regularly showed itself. Therefore I had to cease keeping
some of my greatest favourites. I hope only temporarily.
When Pine branches are required for Capercaillies and
Blackgame, or Sallow or Birch for Willow-Grouse, it is a good
plan to sink champagne bottles filled with water up to their
necks in the ground, and to stick the branches therein. If this
is done in a shady place, the foliage will keep fresh for some
days even in summer. I have found Austrian Pine preferred
to Scotch Fir, and my birds would never touch Larch foliage ;
though I believe in Scotland the contrary has been noted,
I once had four hybrid chicks hatched from eggs laid
by a tame Redgrouse mated with a Blackcock. Circumstances
necessitated their being placed with the ordinary Pheasants in
the rearing field, and I believe they were exposed to too much
sun, which, in a hot summer, is a source of danger to these
natives of cool uplands, and they only survived a few days.
I now 7 pass to the Tragopans, than which there are no
more interesting Game-birds. I have for some years kept
examples of three species : Temminck s, Cabots' and the Satyr
Tragopan. I have bred them all repeatedly. Ihey require
shelter throughout the year, such as they can find for themselves

in summer in thick Yew bushes, or Spruce trees headed back.
But in the North of England at any rate, I find they are better
shut into dry sheds in winter, with a peat moss floor and plenty
of rough perches to climb about on. Like so many mountain
species, whether mammals, birds or plants, Tragopans when
brought down to low altitudes, seem very sensitive to damp cold,
though they look happy enough on a dry frosty day. Mine get,
and I think require, a variety of food--wheat, barley, hemp and
Canary seed, green stuff and any common fruit that is available.
Of monkey and tiger nuts, Tragopans and Monals are very fond,
and also mine get like most of my birds Barley meal scalded
with Poultry meal into a "crumbly" mass. I do not think
Tragopans will live long upon hard grain alone. When first
imported, Tragopans are sometimes difficult subjects, and must
be tempted by raisins, earth worms, soaked maize, or in fact
anything that they will eat. The young cocks do not come into
colour till the second autumn, but before the first winter there
will generally be a few feathers of the second plumage about
the head and neck, enough to indicate their sex. The hens will
sometimes lay in their second summer, but more often not.
The full display of the male Tragopan has often been
described ; it is a wonderful sight, though not often visible even
to its owner. The letting down of the gular flap is momentary,
and the bird seems shy ot exhibiting this when conscious of
being watched. The more common partial "show," when the
throat wattle swells and the wing is dropped to show the beau-
tiful spotted feathering to the female bird, can be seen at almost
any feeding time till the female begins to sit.
One of the peculiarities of the Tragopans, or at least the
three species above named, which alone I have kept, is that they,
invariably in my experience, lay their eggs, not on the ground
like other Game-birds, but in trees and bushes, or disused nests
of other birds such as pigeons, or even in structures of their
own making. A Cabot's Tragopan once somehow discovered an
old Stockdove's nest, 17ft. from the ground, in some ivy on the
stem of a spruce fir. The latter was bare of branches, so that
the bird had to clamber along the spreading bough of a neigh-
bouring yew tree, till she could spring to the ivy.

But little lias been recorded of the habits of the Tragopan
in the wild state, and this propensity was a surprise to me.
Therefore at once we began to put up old Wood Pigeons' nests
or platforms, generally five or six feer from the ground. To these
the birds have always made slight additions, generally in the shape
of a lining of yew or spruce twigs. But though these platforms
are freely taken advantage of (and I must have had well over fifty
clutches of eggs laid here), on one occasion a Satyr Tragopan
declined our help and made rather a frail platform of spruce
twigs and branches, on which she laid her eggs. An old basket
lid, covered with a layer of roots and twigs, and firmly tied into
the fork of a bush will make a good nest. A lame, but other-
wise healthy Cabot's Tragopan this year did not lay till she
was provided with a mound like a large footstool, hidden under
a bush, with a depression on the top some eighteen inches
from the ground, which she conld easily reach. This was taken
advantage of at once. I believe Tragopans to be by nature
monogamous, but in this last case the lame hen was one of two,
both of which laid fertile eggs to a single cock bird.
Tragopans are quite at home in trees, and climb and run
up a sloping branch without making a mistake. My birds spend
much of their time, especially in wet weather, on their perches,
and the young fly up and spring from branch to branch within
a few days of hatching, and are very well provided with flight
feathers at a tender age, as I have elsewhere recorded.
After a few weeks the young Tragopans, like the Monals,
show an inclination to perch at night, and as they are by that
time probably too large for the hen (if they are hatched under a
foster mother) to properly brood. It is best to run her into a dry
shed at night provided with perches of various heights. I have
always taken the eggs and hatched them under small hens.
Silkies and Game Bantams, as the clutches are small, two or
three eggs, generally the former, and this probably induces the
bird to lay again, After ten days or a fortnight, the young thrive
best if allowed to run free during the day with the hen in some
quiet place where the grass is allowed to grow long. Fresh ants'
eggs, gentles, chopped egg, lettuce and meal, and when available,
red currants or raspberries are all suitable food.

This faculty of climbing about trees renders it necessary
to take great care that no bough of a tree within the enclosure
extends to the fence, or the birds will probably escape, as they
will creep out to the end of a slender branch and spring thence
to a surprising distance. For the same reason, if kept in open
enclosures, Tragopans must be rather closely pinioned.
The only member of the group of Mouals that the amateur
is likely to admire is the magnificent Lophophorus splendens, and
it is scarcely possible to conceive anything more splendid than a
well-conditioned male bird of this species, and, fortunately, their
plumage is hard and they generally keep themselves smart.
Much that I have said about Tragopans will apply to Mouals,
especially as to variety of food. But this is a much more hardy
species, and though it is well to give shelter to the birds of the
year in their first winter, the adults can stand any reasonable
amount of cold, and if, as all wild creatures try to do, they can
avoid the combination of wind and wet, they will get through
our winters well enough.
The hen Monal makes her nest on the ground, and my
birds have laid two or three eggs. They are excellent parents
and will rear their young quite well if in an enclosure by them-
selves where there is plenty of cover and shelter from storms.
It is a pretty sight, when the young begin to perch, to see the
parents sitting with the young between them, each spreading a
wing over the chicks ; the cock taking his full share of the
domestic duties.
Care must be taken to separate Monal cocks as the breed-
ing season approaches. They appear heavy, rather stolid birds,
but a strong male will persecute a weaker one with great deter-
mination, even in a large enclosure. I once missed one of two
Monal cocks which had passed the winter together quite amicably.
When we discovered the poor bird, he was several feet up a
9-inch drain, in which he had taken refuge ; but he had been
sadly maltreated and was already dead.
A cock Monal once contrived to mount nearly forty feet up
in a Beech tree. He was to be seen for quite a week on a con-
spicuous dead branch, apparently going through a sort of display
performance. Occasionally he would crouch down on the bough

and utter the curious twittering whistle which is so strongly out
of harmony with the bird&amp;apos;s powerful build and sturdy appearance.
We never saw him down at feeding times, but no doubt he de-
scended occasionally. It reminded me of Wolff's famous picture
of the Capercaillies' display on the pine bough, but I have always
considered that our subject is strictly monogamous.
The cock Monal's ordinary display is striking enough.
His chestnut tail is spread wide and brought forward rapidly
over his back and withdrawn with a curious waving movement,
while his wings are lowered so as to expose the white patch on
the lower crest. He twists his head sideways and flattens his
neck plumage so as to show the glorious metallic lustre to the
best advantage. This part of the performance may be at some
distance from the hen, who is, however, always visible to him.
Presently he will advance towards his mate with a swaggering
stride, with crest nodding, finally reaching her side by three
or four frog-like leaps, and bends down touching the ground
with his beak, with tail still extended to the full, the hen bird
all the while, to the eyes of the human observer at all events,
appearing utterly unconcerned.
With regard to the large family of Pheasants and their
allies, I have little to suggest that is likely to be fresh to my
fellow aviculturists, as these birds are so extensively kept. The
true Pheasants all appear to be perfectly hardy in our climate,
and to my eyes they show no substantial differences of consti-
tution or habit from the ordinary bird of our covers. But it
must not be expected that they will be so prolific as the latter,
for no doubt the power of producing 30--40 or even more eggs
in a season is the result of semi-domestication, and of being kept
for generations in pens to lay and not to hatch and rear. I have
found Versicolor hens very poor layers, and pure Mongolian hens
often lay very scantily, if at all in their second year, but much
better in succeeding seasons. Keepers report favourably of the
Prince of Wales' Pheasant as a hardy bird to rear, and as a
species which leaves its impress (in plumage) upon his cross-
bred stock for many years.
As to straying, I can see no difference; they all like to
escape from overcrowded ground.

Practical Bird- Keeping.
The Partridges usually obtainable are all easy enough to
keep, even the beautiful Ammoperdix of the Desert; but the
young of the species from the warmer regions are, as might be
expected, very sensitive to damp, and all, whether adults or
young, should have access to dry sheds, in which they can dust
and shelter. I have not kept any of the Wood Partridges, and
expect that they require very special treatment. Peat Moss
litter makes an excellent floor for such sheds as it is absorbent
and a deodorizer. Unless the ventilation is really effective, fire-
heat, unless in exceptional frosty weather, is better dispensed
with.
If I may offer one or two pieces of advice, I would urge
that it is a great mistake to keep too many birds. Overcrowding
leads to tainted ground and a host of trouble. Grit must never
be forgotten as it is absolutely essential to this class of bird. A
Grouse chick of forty-eight hours w&amp;apos;as found to have its gizzard
well provided with grit (Report of the Committee on Grouse
disease). Quartz grit is the best if to be had. After the first
severe frost, lettuces and even cabbages are often unprocurable,
and, until the grass grows freely, some substitute for green food
is desirable for grain-fed birds. I find Mangel-Wurzel most
useful, and take care to have a supply sufficient to last w 7 ell on
into the spring. But, as I have already said, care must be taken
that the roots do not get frozen.
The incubation periods of some of the birds referred to in
this paper, as noted by me, may interest some:--Capercaillie, 26
days; Blackgame, 25--26 days ; Redgrouse, 20--21 days; Willow
Grouse, 20--21 days; Monal, 28--29 days ; Tragopan, 29 days.

THE TWO NONPAREILS.
Cycinospiza ciris and Erythrura prasina.
By Frank Finn, B.A., F.Z.S.
From the point of view of pure aviculture -- by which I
understand keeping birds because one likes them, without any
ulterior scientific motive--there are no small finches which I
prefer to the Nonpareil of America and its Pintailed imitator
from the far East. Colour appeals to me more than anything
else, and no one can deny that these two birds have plenty of
it, albeit rather differently laid on.
Their status in the bird trade has changed curiously.
In the early days of this Society the American bird was the
common kind, and the other rarely imported and little known.
Now, owing to the prohibition of the export of United States
birds, the American Nonpareil has become comparatively scarce
and expensive, while the Pintaiied has during the last few years
been so freely imported that it has been the most cheaply
obtainable of all bright-coloured birds.
The American Nonpareil (Cyanospiza ciris ) is certainly
well named ; there is nothing like it in the way of startling
brilliance of colour, laid on in such a w*ay that the bird really
does look as if it were painted. In fact, on my asking a small
retail dealer whether he ever found Nonpareils were regarded
with suspicion by the public, he replied that they were ; in fact, he
had been asked how he could have the face to keep such obvious
frauds in his shop. The old belief in painted birds evidently
dies a great deal harder than the practice, now all but extinct.

The hen Nonpareil never was common in the trade ; her
colour is a subdued green above and pale buff below ; but many
birds thus coloured are liable to turn out to be young cocks.
Some hens, however, were recently on sale at Green's in Covent
Garden for months ; they showed no signs of being other than
females, and I was surprised that they did not find purchasers.
Although Nonpareils have frequently been bred on the Conti-
nent, few people seem to have tried them here, though the Rev.
C. D. Farrar bred them in 1899 (A vie. Mag., Ser. I. v., p. 165,)
The young, he says, were reared entirely on insect food ; but
according to Keulemans (A Natural History of Cage Birds, 1871)
they can be reared in a canary breeding-cage with egg-food and
sugared sop by way of soft food ! However they feed them.
Continental fanciers seem to consider them easy subjects for
breeding, judging from what Russ says (Handbucli fur Vogel-
liebhaber, as quoted by Dr. Butler in Foreign Finches in Cap-
tivity) about their breeding regularly two or three times a year,
and the only objection to breeding them being the difficulty of
distinguishing the young cocks. The full plumage is not attained
till the bird is three years old -- an unusually long time for a
passerine bird. The nest is made in a bush or open basket, and
the eggs are spotted with brown. One great drawback to this
species is the fact that the cock by degrees loses its beautiful
red tints and assumes yellow instead, though under conditions
as natural as possible for an inhabitant of the warm parts of
North America -- a sunny outdoor aviary--the colour is said to
be retained. Some difference of opinion exists as to whether
Nonpareils have an undress plumage, going into hen feather in
the winter ; but the general verdict is that they do not, the
replacement of red by yellow being permanent and due to un-
favourable conditions, while the blue of the head remains.
At the same time, it is possible for a bird to assume, in
captivity, a seasonal change unknown in the wild state ; it is
well known that the Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) of America
becomes very pale in captivity and remains so. Yet, of our
breeding specimens in the Calcutta Zoo in my time, the hens
were always salmon-colour, while the old cock had his salmon
plumage enhanced by stains of scarlet in the breeding season

only. To return to our subject--the Nonpareil has a fairly good
song, and will get on with most birds of his size, except his own
species and his relative the Indigo-bird (Cyanospiza cyanea ) ; he
would probably dislike another cousin, the Rainbow Bunting
(C. leclancheri), even worse. This species should always have
fruit and insects--or some substitute for them--as well as seed.
I noticed one I kept was keen on apple and on inga seed. He
did not fight with an Indigo in the same cage, but gave way
to him, only asserting himself in the important matter of meal-
worms.
The Pintailed Nonpareil (Erythrwa ptasina ) is also well
named, for, although the two finches are not nearly related, the
American belonging to the Bunting group and the Asiatic to
the Grassfinches, there is certainly a resemblance in their liberal
endowment of colour, while the long sharp tail of the Eastern
Nonpareil is a very striking character. The hen in this species,
differs more from the cock than in the original Nonpareil, for
though the red is less completely suppressed in her, remaining
on the tail, though replaced by buff on the breast, the tail itself,
though pointed, is quite short; she is, in fact, a stumpy ugly
little bird altogether.
The coincidental resemblance between the two birds goes
further yet; for in some Pintail Nonpareils the red of the plumage
is replaced by yellow, as in the cage-moulted male of the true
kind. In the yellow-tailed Pintails, however, this aberration of
colour is found in the wild bird; it occurs in both sexes, and
specimens may be found in any large series of live birds or skins.
These resemblances, however, taken together, are very curious ;
caricaturing the theorizer on insects, we might say that the true
Nonpareil, scarce yet reasonably easy to keep, "mimics" the
very common but very difficult Pintail Nonpareil to escape the
clutches of the aviculturist! This difficulty of keeping is a sad
drawback to the lovely Pintail, a bird absolutely unrivalled in the
feathered world for its combination of brilliance of hue with the
delicacy of tinting which rivals the lovely colours of the rainbow
or prism. Its cheapness is due to the fact that it is a very com-
mon bird in the East Indies--a common pest, in fact, in the
rice-field ; but it is a champion dier, and has a way of looking

well one minute and being dead half an hour later that has so far
baffled research.
As I found it did not live any better in Calcutta than here, a
warm climate and paddy-rice are not sufficient to keep it alive ; in
fact, I may here remark that, according to my Indian experience,
if a creature is hard to keep here it is equally hard to keep in its
own country. Delicacy depends more on timidity or some other
moral character, or on an unadaptable digestion, than on climate,
though of course the quick change of climate undergone during
importation does not make matters at all easier for creatures
whose health is already below par by reason of close confine-
ment, even if not actually recently captured. I should advise
anyone who is trying to keep Pintail Nonpareils to endeavour
to supply as great a variety of food as they can be got to take,
in the hope of hitting on the essential thing. If they do uot
take to soft food, fruit, insects, or what not, such a bird as a Pekin
Robin confined with them, or in a separate compartment with a
wire partition, may teach them the trick, as bird gastronomy is
largely a matter of imitation. Above all, let us uot have people
saying that we must not try to keep the bird, because it is cruel;
the creature is a pest at home, which would be killed if not
exported, and nothing is easier or more common now-a-days than
the trotting out of some lofty motive like humanitariauism to
excuse the laziness and want of resource which are such a
characteristic of over-civilized communities.
It is not surprising that the Pintailed Nonpariel has not
bred here, though, according to Dr. Butler, it bred in Germany
as long ago as 1886 ; the nest is evidently of the domed type
usual in the Mannikin group, as it is described as thick-walled
and with wide cavity and narrow entrance-hole.
I11 conclusion, I may here remark on the curious fact that
this common bird is hard to keep and breed, while the nearly
allied but rare Parrot-fincli is an easy subject. I have so often
noticed this in pairs of allies that I think there must be more
than a coincidence in it; and two explanations suggest them-
selves. One is that the rare bird finds the conditions of captivity
more suitable to it than those offered by nature ; the other is that
when a bird is dear people will take a lot of trouble over it,

while if rare it is not likely to be overcrowded during importa-

moral is obvious.
AUGUST, 1912.
By Miss E. M. Hincks.
What a summer!--damp and cold--it seems almost as if
it could not have been worse. My birds certainly have not
relished it. The aviary floors have been soaking every day for
months now. It seems to me the only type of floor suited to
this weather would be one of cement laid at an acute angle.
My aviaries are small and my birds of quite ordinary
kinds, of which I am thankful just now. There are three of them.
No. 1 containing five young Saffron Finches just coming
into colour. Of these I hope that only one is a cock ; for, earlier
in the year, two other young cock Saffrons who had been living
together for months, were left together for one day too long,
with the result that they fought one another to the death.
No. 2. A pair of Goldfinches. The old pair of Saffrons,
and, up till a week ago, a pair of Zebra Finches. Since then the
cock has been left a widower and has been busily engaged in
rearing the family of two, who appeared in public yesterday.
The third aviary is below the garden (terraced) inside the
wood. It is much less exposed than the other two, but is also
shadier. The beehives standing alongside should come in useful
in providing insect food for my two Pekin Robins, though I
cannot say that I have ever seen them in pursuit of anything but
wasps, moths or midges. The occupants of this aviary are:--
Two hen Pekin Robins, Grey Singing Finches, Avadavats, a
Grey, an Orange-cheek and a Crimson-eared Waxbill, also one
cock South American Grey Finch, the best songster of the party,
but he is of rather a retiring disposition, always electing to sing
whilst alone in the inner aviary house. The Cordon Bleu (or
Gordon Blue, the gypsies name for these birds) must be quite an
aged bird, I have had him several years and he is growing white
(flight) feathers in both wings, which adds greatly to his vener-
able appearance. Is this usual ?

Mr. W. E. Teschemaker,
Mice have been a great trouble this year. It is no wonder,
as in the garden here the mice caught in traps are reckoned, not
by the dozen, but by the gross. The aviaries should have been
made mouse-proof, but this was too expensive. If a member
could tell me of any hanging aviary seed-dish that is mouse-
proof and thoroughly waterproof as well I should be most grateful.
What mice are caught in the aviaries are accounted for by a fox-
terrier who almost invariably accompanies me whilst feeding the
birds. She is quite steady with birds, as they are with her.
I have planted hops and roses in my aviaries, in the hope
of inducing green fly, but have never found a sign of it on either.
This may be owing to the fact that the birds keep them clean,
lor there is no lack of the insect on the rose trees in the garden
where they are not specially required.

and enquiries produced nothing more satisfactory than the state-
ment that there was much snow in the south of Germany but no
Blackstarts (it was the early spring of 1911) and a definite promise
from one man that he would send me two hens in July. I closed
with this offer after impressing upon my correspondent that
hand-reared birds would be useless for my purpose and equally
so birds taken at a high elevation in the mountains. In due
course the "House-red-tails" were sent to a dealer in Berlin and
forwarded thence to me ; they were nice little birds, but there
was nothing feminine about their appearance. But one day in
the early autumn I received a post-card from the aforesaid Berlin
dealer to the effect that he " feared that I might find that the
House-red-tails which Herr.had sent were cocks, so he had
taken the liberty of forwarding an adult hen." There is an
innate courtesy about the German bird-dealer which might be
imitated on this side of the Channel with great advantage.

two Redstarts together during the winter, even though they may
have been the best of friends and have even paired, during the
preceding summer. Unless the two birds are exactly evenly
matched in strength one will assuredly slay the other; so Tites
and the new arrival spent the winter apart. I11 the spring I
caught up the female and caged her for a few days for inspection.
The more I looked at that hen the more convinced I was that,
if the correct environment were provided, she would prove a
breeder. As mentioned above, I had already decided that the
required environment would have to include a nest-box in a dark
corner under a roof and I, therefore, selected a quiet corner of
the old walled-garden aviary which was provided with a small
shed about seven feet high. In the furthest corner of this shed a
flat wooden ledge had been nailed up years ago, and on this
ledge (which is shown in the photo) two South American
Thrushes, which I believe to have been hens of two different
species, had constructed a mud foundation for a nest. All that
remained to do was to fix the nest-box under this ledge.
I first introduced Tites to these breeding quarters and,
later in the spring, I caged the female and hung up the cage in
the shed. I regret to say that Tites did not behave at all nicely
to his prospective bride. His tail quivered with fury like the
trembler of an induction coil : he perched on the top of the cage
and in unmistakeable and unparliamentary (?) language told the
lady what he thought of her and what her fate would be. But
the lady simply gazed at him placidly for well she knew--not
only by intuition but by actual experience--that, for all his
truculence, Tites would yet grovel at her feet; you see this was
not her first experience of matrimony. On the fourth day I saw
Tites talking to his partner quite politely, and then--and not
before then--I opened the cage door. The next thing was to
procure a counterfoil for Tites. There seems to be a conven-
tional theory that the ideal method is to isolate each breeding
pair of birds in a separate aviary, but a little reflection will
convince us that this is a fundamental error. An insectivorous
bird usually arrives at its nesting-station after along and arduous
migratory flight, during which food has been scarce, and almost
at once enters upon a long and arduous struggle with various

Mr. W. F. Teschemaker,
rivals for a nesting-site and a mate ; it is, therefore, as lean and
hard as a trained athlete. It is this condition that we want to
reproduce: if we shut up a pair by themselves we shall find that
they will quickly become fat, sluggish and out of sorts. For a
counterfoil I selected a pair of Pekin Robins, both because they
were a little bigger than Tites and therefore not likely to be
slain by him, and also because they would be certain to go to
nest. Thus you will see that, instead of trusting to "luck," I
based my calculations on environment, competition, suggestion,
and lastly, but by no means leastly, on a breeding hen.
The Pekins soon went to nest but they were not allowed to
hatch, in which case the state of war between the two families
would have developed from a healthy recreation into a pitched
battle. The next event was the building of a very neat little
nest by Tites alone in the small nest-box (this nest can only be
dimly seen in the photo). Then came a rather long interregnum
and at last one day the hen House-red-tail glided into the nest that
Tites built, inspected it and glided out again. The psychological
moment had now arrived : I extracted the Pekins. On the 9th
June the first egg was laid and the clutch of five was completed
and incubation commenced on the 13th. It was not possible to
inspect the eggs 011 account of the want of light, but I ascertained
the number (and at the same time tested the statement in one of
the bird-books that a Blackstart will always desert if the eggs
are handled) by inserting a finger daily. The female undertook
the entire task of incubation, but Tites sang to her to while away
the time. The song of this species is quite unique : it consists of
a low warbling interspersed with some curious guttural notes
which sound as if they were produced by the winding up of
some machine, the ratchet and pall of the winding drum of a
grandfather's clock for choice. On the 26th, I picked up the
half-shell of a hatched egg in the flight; it was very round,
of a pure translucent white and with a peculiar gloss. Tites
fed the young and also his partner with praiseworthy diligence.
Having lost the feathers of the crown, as the result of a cat-raid,
and having also suffered in many skirmishes with the Pekins, he
was a most disreputable looking object, but his vitality was un-
impaired and his energy immense. I extracted an unhatched

egg on the 29th, and ascertained that there were two young. It
was impossible to examine the latter, however, in such a dark
corner so, 011 the 4th July, I lighted a match and held it to the
nest. As it happened, Tites at that very moment flew into the
shed and apparently jumped to the conclusion that I was trying
to cremate his offspring; he flew out again exclaiming in strident
tones " Tit-tit-tit-tit tit-er-er-tit," and was evidently very much
upset, for, when I passed through the aviary again an hour or
two later, he was still talking about the matter. However, I
explained to him that the rule of this aviary was that all nests
must be examined daily, and that, if he did not like it, he must
make the best of it. The female was remarkably steady and
would almost allow me to place my hand upon her when on the
nest.
On the 9th July she commenced to build a new nest on the
top of the mud nest above alluded to, and this nest, which she
built without any assistance, was of a quite different type--large,
shallow, unlined, and constructed entirely of hay; the first nest,
which Tites built, was composed chiefly of moss, lined with some
hair and feathers. The first egg of the second clutch was laid
on the nth, and it is this clutch which is shown in the photo.
The dimensions were .So by .62in. The young left the nest on
the 12th, and their distinctive plumage interested me much.
Their tails, which were about an inch long, and also the under
tail-coverts were rufous * ; the flanges of the beak were lemon
colour and, contrasting with their dark mottled breasts, were
rather conspicuous. But what chiefly surprised me was that
the} 7 were so much darker than the adult female in body colour.
I11 such standard works as Morris, Bechstein, and even in the
accurate Saunders will be found the statement that the young
resemble the female, whereas, unless this was quite an abnormal
case, they (that is to say the young males) really much more
closely resemble the adult male on leaving the nest. And yet, in
their first autumn, even a good judge will often have difficulty
in distinguishing between the sexes. I recollect that our mem-
" N.B. The two middle rectrices are dark-brown : when the tail is not expanded,
these two are the upper ones and their colour is apparently protective, covering- and con-
cealing the bright rufous of the other rectrices.

her, Mr. Galloway, once sent me a supposed hen which, at the
ensuing spring moult, declared itself to be a male, and Dr.
Thwaites sent me the skin of a young male (as sexed by a
taxidermist) which had died at the commencement of February,
and a close examination of the plumage revealed no other indi-
cation of sex than the fact that the breast feathers were darker
along the quill. The explanation seems to be that young male
Blackstarts assume an eclipse plumage upon moulting the nest
plumage, or some part of the latter. As I write (16th Aug.) the
young have commenced to moult and are evidently becoming
lighter, but I am prevented by our "eight weeks rule" (which
for this very reason I have never thought a very wise one) from
including an account of the moult in these notes.
A young migrating Redstart, which insisted on coming
into the house, despite several evictions, and which was therefore
caged on the 14th July, shed the mottled nest plumage a week
later, and I think, therefore, that we may assume that this moult
takes place in the case of both species at the age of about five
weeks. The contrast between the young of the two species is,
however, very marked. A young male Redstart looks very like
a young Robin, but a young male Blackstart, as I have said
above, closely resembles an adult male, except for the area of
white on the wing of the latter. The Redstart began to sing on
17th July (three days after its capture!) and one of the young
Blackstarts on 14th August.
The young "House-red-tails" were exceedingly clever at
hiding themselves, after leaving the nest, and it was often very
difficult to locate them even in their tiny aviary. As I mentioned,
under the head of environment, this aviary was built in a corner
where two old cob walls met, and into the crannies and crevices
of these walls they used to creep and squat motionless ; they
would also squat in old nests in the shrubs and even on the
ground. Another point that impressed me was that, even when
perched in a conspicuous position on an apricot tree trained
against the wall they would remain absolutely motionless, with
tails held rigid, until they saw that they had been observed, when
their tails would at once begin to quiver in the manner so
characteristic of this species. With regard to this latter point:

I have often seen the statement that the tail motion both of this
species and of the Redstart is horizontal. After very close
observation I have come to the conclusion that the motion is
(1) generally vertical, (2) sometimes diagonal, (3) sometimes
elliptical, but I have never been able to convince myself that it
is ever truly horizontal. Nevertheless it is not an easy matter
to decide because the motion is so rapid.

The pair of Red-backed Shrikes -- the history of which was
recorded in tli o. Avicultural Magazine , 1904 (page 339) and 1911
(page 37)--have again nested in the present year. This is the
seventh brood produced by these birds in captivity. As already
reported they did not nest last year, and I suspected they had
reached the limit of age for reproductive functions. However,
soon after they had been moved into their usual summer quarters
in the middle of May the hen commenced to sit (20th May) and
the young were hatched on the 6th of June. I had determined to
remove the young from their aviary as soon as they were ready
to leave the nest, as they were dangerously exposed to attack
from their neighbours, a pair of Black-necked Grackles, which
were separated from the Shrikes by wire-netting only. On the
present occasion the young left the nest at the early age of
twelve days. There were five of them, all remarkably strong.
They throve well under artificial feeding, and are now strong on
the wing and perfectly independent.
To my surprise, two days after the removal of the young,
the parent birds re-commenced breeding in the same nest ; and
two eggs were laid on successive days, when, to my great regret,
the hen bird was found dead on the ground below the nest.

laying eggs for a second brood was too much for her and ex-

was only one year old, she also had produced two broods.
A pair of Black-necked Grackles (Gracupica nigricollis)
inhabited the adjoining aviary. Nothing is known of the nidi-
fication and nesting habits of this species, and I was therefore
anxious to obtain information on this point. They built a large
nest of straw in a dense box bush, and eggs were laid but dis-
appeared in an unaccountable manner. I strongly suspect that
they were broken and eaten by the male bird, a most ill-tempered
creature. Only fragments of the egg were found, and these
were on the ground, showing that the eggs are of an uniform
turquoise-blue colour.

If waterfowl or waders are shipped in barred-floored cane
cages, it is a good plan to have a big tin bath made in which the
lower part of the cage can fit ; this will serve instead of a draw-
tray to receive dirt, and can be washed out when decks are
cleaned, while at the same time it can be filled with water in
favourable weather and used as a bath, the cage being plunged
into it.
In any case, it is advisable to wet the legs and feet of
waders and waterfowl pretty frequently, unless the weather is too
cold, to prevent them getting dry and feverish. A sprayer comes
in handy for this sort of thing. For all sorts of bathing fresh
water should be used, not salt, and all means taken to avoid
birds getting wetted by the sea; even sea-birds do not like salt
water so much as fresh for bathing. Gulls gladly resort to fresh-
water streams and pools to bathe, if near the sea; and in hot
countries Cormorants keep to fresh water and avoid the sea as a
rule; while everybody knows it is only frost and fear of man
which draws the ordinary ducks sea-wards.

of life by washing the unhappy ducks in the ships' hen-coops in
salt water, to the great improvement of their condition ; but then,
being ordinary tame ducks, they could be let out on deck.
Flapping and exercising to dry after bathing is of course im-
portant; hence it is well to think twice before one wets the
plumage of a bird cooped up.
Other birds than waterfowl are often somewhat special
in their transport requirements, and these groups may now be
dealt with.
Game-birds, such as the pheasant and partridge tribe,
sandgrouse, and tinamous, are given to springing up with ex-
plosive violence on alarm, and hurting their heads. Hence the
top of their cages should be well padded, or have a canvas
ceiling strained a little below the wooden top. It is in their
case especially that the allowance of as little head-room as is
consistent with comfort is desirable. On the other hand, birds
like Hornbills, which have long bills and jerk them up when
swallowing, need more head-room than one would at first be
inclined to allow them when the bill is in the usual horizontal
position.
Large birds with long tails, like Pies and pheasants, are
often better accommodated by having their trains clipped ; in the
case of the cock Argus it may be necessary to clip the long
secondaries also. It should be remembered that long-billed
birds, and some short-billed ones also, which drink by scooping
up the water as it were, cannot drink easily if at all out of a pot,
and need a long vessel. If this is inconvenient for a cage, it
must be introduced twice a day. Ground-birds with very small
feet, like Sand-grouse, Bustards and Thick-knee Plovers, need a
very close-barred wooden grating to the floor lest their legs slip
through ; in their case it is best to substitute sand, saw dust, or
mats frequently changed, if obtainable, though on the Chinese
style of flat-barred cane floors with bars only half-an-inch apart
anything could travel. Dusting accommodation for birds such
as game-birds, can be dispensed with, just as water for water-
bathing birds, &amp;apos;during a voyage. But it is much more easily

Mr. Frank Finn,
supplied, and involves no risk, as if a box containing sand or
earth is upset in a cage no harm is done, while superfluous water
makes everything cold and sloppy.
Birds like Woodpeckers and Creepers, which travel on the
trunks and limbs of trees, must of course have the back and
sides of their cages covered with some sort of bark; or failing
this with rows of horizontal battens. Woodpeckers have a most
astonishing power of cutting their way out, and it would be best
to have their box-cages tin-cased. Hanging-parrakeets (I always
prefer the neat German name bat-parrots for these) need a wire-
netting or grating ceiling below the roof in a box-cage, as they
sleep and spend much waking time hanging upside down.
Birds like Kingfishers, Rollers, Bee-eaters, Trogons, etc.,
which hardly use their feet except for perching and do not hop
about, need as large a cage as you can give them, with only two
perches, one at each end on the same level, so as to give them as
much wing exercise as possible. Humming-birds are also birds
of little foot-power and need few perches, but have a remarkable
power of taking wing-exercise in a small space ; great care should
be taken to keep their plumage from getting sticky, as without
use of their wings they are nearly helpless, unlike Sunbirds
which hop about freely. Humming-birds are more sensitive to
cold than any others, and become insensible if chilled, though
they can be revived by warmth in such a case.
We come now to the question of food. Of course the
right thing is to take the special brand of soft food one favours,
or material for making one's own, to say nothing of mealworms,
as well as appropriate seeds for seed-eaters. Supplies, however,
may be spoilt by sea-damage, lost or stolen ; and we may be
thrown again on our own resources for makeshift foods. In most
places abroad it will not be possible to get ants' eggs, dried flies,
dried silkworm pupae, meat meal, egg flake, and what not; pos-
sibly not even Canary seed may be available; and millet, so
common a grain in the tropics, does not suit everything.
It is as well, therefore, to rid one's self of any prejudice
against using egg, raw meat, milk, or bread, for soft-bills, be-
cause these things can be got anywhere where Europeans live,
and birds can be kept on them if carefully and thoughtfully

administered, and were, before our modern conveniences of
feeding were introduced. Such crude articles of human diet
may not suit some delicate species indefinitely, but one has, with
care and luck in weather, a chance to pull any bird through a
few weeks' voyage till the better supplies are secured ; and many
species take quite well to the articles named. Bread of course
should be stale, well crumbled and intimately mixed with the
egg, which should be very hard-boiled, or the meat, which should
be finely minced, or scraped for very tiny birds. Biscuit can, of
course, always be substituted, and may be easier to get. Rice
should be dry-boiled and grainy, as one gets it in the East, and
milk-sop should not be sloppy, except for birds which suck up
their food. Condensed milk alone is well taken by honey-sucking
birds such as lories, sunbirds, and I believe humming-birds, and
is easy to get ; in fact, it is in most cases the only milk one will
get at sea, as cows and goats are seldom carried.
Meat cut up into bits is taken by large insect-eaters, and
will keep the purely insectivorous kinds, such as land-kingfishers
and rollers, by itself. Fish-eaters will also live on meat, though
it is not good as a permanent diet.
Fruit-eating birds can be got to take dry-boiled rice and
boiled potatoes cut up ; they can also have soaked bread and
biscuit and soaked dried fruit.
Grain-eaters should be got on to crushed biscuit or stale
bread in case grain or seed of the proper sort is wanting. A bird
may eat some kinds of seed and starve on it; I have been told
this is the case with common pigeons when fed on paddy-rice.
Green food can be supplied by chopped raw roots or apple, or
sprouted seeds.
With regard to live food ; some kinds of tropical fish, such
as the Koee ( A?iabas scandens ) and Sin gee ( Saccobranchus fossilis)
of India, will travel well in but little water, and would come in
well for feeding carnivorous or fish-eating birds; cut up, they
would be better for insect-eaters than flesh meat, being less
heavy.
Earthworms will travel well in damp soil in well-cleaned
kerosene tins ; frogs can also be transported in such tins with
turf and fresh water. Water-snails should prove equally easy of

Mr. Frank Finn,
carriage, while laud-snails are no trouble at all: put them in a
box and they will seal themselves up away for hibernation or
" aestivation," its substitute in the tropical dry season. Cock-
roaches can be got on many, perhaps most ships; the large
American sort is the usual one, and is good for feeding large
birds, the small German cockroach is, however, a nicer insect,
and does well for small birds, but I only remember getting these
on one ship. House-flies often abound in port or soon after
leaving it, and it is as well to have a few balloon fly-traps.
Crickets are also, if I remember right, numbered among ship-
insects. So, certainly, alas ! are those beastly little yellow ants,
which birds, as far as I know, won't eat; while they will eat the
bird's food and annoy them generally.
Mechanical digestives, like grit for ordinary, especially
seed-eating, birds, and feathers or fur for birds of prey, can be
temporarily dispensed with ; but it is best to provide them if
possible; chopped tow will do instead of fur or feather. If grit
cannot be supplied regularly it is better withheld, and the birds
weaned on to it again on landing.
Water can be dispensed with by some birds, such as Hawks,
Owls, Kingfishers, Bustards, and Horubills. but it is best to offer
it daily even to these. Others should of course have it always by
them, and in the case of waterfowl the food should be placed in
it, especially for ducks.
With all our care in housing and feeding, however, there
remains what I have previously alluded to as the most insuper-
able difficulty in bird importation--changes in temperature on
the voyage, and especially the change from heat to cold. It is
generally colder at sea than on land, in our latitudes very much
colder; and a bird packed for shipment must necessarily be below
par in most instances, owing to insufficient exercise and food
which may not be of the most absolutely suitable character.
Moreover it may have been only recently captured, thus, even
if by nature an inhabitant of a temperate or even cold region--a
mountain bird for instance--it is not in a condition to resist cold
successfully ; and hence as much warmth and comfort as can be
secured should be a first consideration with all who import any
kind of birds. It is in the matter of cold that failure is most to

be feared ; heat may cause discomfort in some places, as in the
Red Sea in the summer months, but if direct sun--which of
course in the tropics is deadly dangerous--be avoided, heat is
less risky than cold. A bird may be panting for days and not
seriously upset; far otherwise if he has been shivering.
It must, therefore, be clearly understood, that success must
depend to a very great extent on facilities for keeping the stock
warm and sheltered ; but, of course, the better the birds are fed,
and the more comfortably they are housed, the better can they
resist the ordeals that may come. But, on the whole, I think
that small cages, which can be put inside somewhere, are far
safer speculations in most voyages than large ones which must
stand on deck, although in these the stock can exercise better.
With regard to attendance, one will, I should hope, always
feed and clean one's birds one's-self: I always did, and welcomed
the work as a relief from the monotony of shipboard life. But
the functionary--butcher or "stock topass "--who is supposed
to do these things, should in all cases be conciliated by a fee;
his interest should be secured, and any money laid out in this
way is well spent. But I object to letting these people look after
birds if I possibly can--if any blunders are made I prefer to take
the risk of my own rather than other people's; though, of course
if there is much stock, or very dirty work, assistance is of some
use. In the case of sending birds in the charge of a ship's
butcher or other maritime employe, the same principle of paying
well should be observed ; parsimoniousness in these matters is
fatal as well as unfair. The best plan is to give the man a lump
sum and a percentage on sound arrivals. An intelligent and
conscientious man, well treated, will get as good results, often,
as one could one's-self.
A few words as to what to select in the matter of stock
may not be amiss in conclusion. Throughout this article I have
tried to provide for the unexpected that proverbially always
happens ; so I will assume that our importer knows little about
the avicultural possibilities of the country he is going to, and
little of the trade in the home country. I therefore advise, on
general principles, avoiding anything one knows to be in the
trade already, unless this is rare or usually arrives in poor con-

dition. But do not despise the common birds of a foreign country
because they are common there; they may be, and often are,
particularly uncommon in the bird trade, or even new to avicul-
ture. Insectivorous birds are of course the hardest to manage,
but on that account the most likely to be worth taking. Fruit-
and honey-eaters are on the whole the best speculation, being
usually attractive and not unduly hard to carry with good atten-
tion. Finally, on the whole, a small bird is to be preferred to a
large one, a bright-coloured species to a dull one, and a collection
of several sorts to a large lot of one kind. I am speaking, of
course, for people who want to sell their surplus ; for scientific
aviculture I should say, specialize on birds of types not usually
kept at all.

During the past two months several of the birds in the
Summer aviary have nested and reared their young. Bronze-
winged Pigeons, Scaly Doves, White-fronted and Senegal Doves
have bred freely. The two young Magpie Tanagers mentioned
in the August number progressed well for a time. While I was
away in August I heard that one had disappeared, but that the
other had left the nest and was feeding itself. On my return we
searched for the one young bird. The cover was so thick that it
was difficult to find anything in this particular compartment, and
although we did not discover the young Tanager I still had hopes
of seeing it later. But now I have given up hope, and fear that
the cold wet weather of August was too much for it.
In spite of the bad weather the pair of Crimson Finches
brought off three young birds, which are now full grown and
closely resemble their mother. A pair of Peale's Parrot-Finches
have also reared two young birds. These are green with yellowish
bills, exactly like the young of the New Caledonian Parrot Finch
(E. psittaceaf). Both the Crimson Finches and Parrot Finches are
nesting again.
The Douglas Quail (Lophortyx douglasi) from Mexico is an
extremely rare bird, and the male with his plume of long reddish

feathers on the head is one of the most handsome of the Quails.
The hen laid ten eggs in a nest in the thick grass, approached
through a tunnel under the grass. She was apparently acci-
dentally disturbed and refused to sit, so the eggs were taken and
hatched in an incubator, The chicks which were if anything
less in size than those of Californian Quails, were placed in a
" Hearson's Foster Mother," and six of them have been success-
fully reared to maturity, a feat deserving of great praise on the
part of MacDonald, the keeper who was entrusted with their care.
The same foster-mother now contains fifteen other young Quails
hatched from eggs laid by Colinus pec/oralis and Eupsychortyx
nigrigularis , both very rare American species. The young birds
are about half-grown and in first-rate health and condition.
Quails so often lay numbers of eggs, but refuse to sit in captivity,
and the question of the hatching and rearing of the chicks is often
a puzzling one. Hens are altogether too large for such frail mites,
and the most careful ones rarely rear more than a small per-
centage of those hatched. It is, therefore, very satisfactory to
find that the eggs hatch perfectly in an incubator at the same
temperature as hen's eggs (104* Fahr.) and that with care the
young can be reared in a "foster-mother." D. S.-S.

bird is the same size and style as the chestnut-bellied Niltava, but the
colouring is even more striking. The crown of the head and the whole of
the back is a brilliant turquoise blue, the wings and tail being darker, each
feather edged with blue. Cheeks, throat and chest black ; underparts pure
white; flanks greyish.
This Niltava has an exceedingly sweet and varied song ; some
stanzas being not unlike an English Robin's, others more resembling the
bird voices of the wild moors, as uttered by different Buntings and Pipits.
Its notes are superior to those of its chestnut-bellied cousin.
My azure blue, black and white Niltava flies about in my bedroom of
a morning, and is already becoming tame, darting down for a mealworm,
which he will very soon take from my fingers. If it is N. cyanomelcena it is
also a native of Japan. No doubt the female is a duller coloured bird.

Sir, --I send you herewith a photo, of the second nest of the Crested
Larks. It was not possible to photograph the first nest satisfactorily on
account of the close proximity of a Yellow Wagtail incubating a clutch of
eggs. This second clutch hatched on the 5th of August. The four eggs
were much alike and do not resemble those of the first clutch ; their dimen-
sions are .89m. by .65in. I gave two young Larks of the first brood to
Mr. C. Harrison, whose name was mentioned in my recent notes. For
years past he has been making experiments with a view to obtaining a seed-
eating bird which will correctly imitate the song of the Nightingale and,
in my opinion, there is nothing so likely to perform the feat as a Crested
Lark, caged as a "runner " before it has heard the song of its own species.
These two birds differed markedly, one being larger, greyer and having
more crest, the smaller one (which I took to be a hen) being much more
richly mottled with buff terminals to the feathers of the back, They were
extremely wild in the aviary and injured their heads severely, but became
quite steady when caged. The natural flight of this species is of the rising
and falling type, like that of our Skylark, and it was interesting to note
that, while the young always flew in this way, the adults flew in a straight
horizontal line, having evidently learned by experience that there was not
room in the aviary for the former method.
There were several typographical errors in my notes, as printed,
which did not occur in the MS. This was due to the fact that the latter
was sent in very late and that there was not tune to send me the proofs.

The second part of this book, which we have previously
noticed in our pages is now to hand, and fully bears out the
promise of the former part. It deals with twelve species of
Francolin and four species of Quail, all of which are figured in
a series of excellent coloured plates drawn by Sergeant C. G.
Davies. The notes given under each species are clear and con-
cise, so that no sportsman, be he ornithologist or not, should find
any difficulty in identifying any bird lie may get. The author
seems rather doubtful as to the proper use of trinomials. He
uses them, quite correctly in our opinion, when dealing with the
two races of the Red-necked Francolin, but treats the Orange
River and Buthkoger's Francolins as distinct species. This
technical error, however, does not in any way detract from the
practical utility of the book.
PRACTICAL BIRD-KEEPING.
XX.--CRANES.
By R. Cosgrave.
The various accounts written of Cranes do not give much
practical advice to the amateur who seeks help with regard to the
management of these most satisfactory aviary birds.
In the first place, my advice is not to purchase a cripple
at any price. See that the birds are sound and healthy, do not
trouble if the plumage is rough, that comes all right at the first
moult. Most dealers tell us that all Cranes must have fish ; that
is by no means necessary, as I have tried to show from time
to time. When you get a fresh acquisition, by all means give
it a little fish, but decrease the quantity daily for a week or two,
finally dropping it altogether. Only in one case is it essential
to give a little fish occasionally, namely, to the Asiatic or White
Crane (Gras leucogeranus ), for it is the most aquatic of all the
family and an expert fisherman. Feed on good wheat, barley,

small round maize, barley meal (English), and, if # s. d. permits,
give bread cut up in small pieces, which can be swallowed easily ;
do not give cheap corn, it is penny wise and pound foolish to do
so. The natural times of feeding are in the early mornings and
evenings, hence this is the best rule to follow with birds in
confinement.
All Cranes, without exception, require a good grass run,
the larger the better, and, where possible, they should be located
near a lake, pond or stream so that the birds can wade or wash
at pleasure ; to enjoy a wash or bath they like a good depth of
clear water, from one to three feet, according to the size of the
bird ; the Sams and Manchurians like it still deeper. A natural
bottom in all cases is most important; concrete being much too
hard as the birds spend a good deal of time wading about, and at
night roost knee deep in water, no matter how cold and wet the
weather may be.
With regard to housing in winter, one must be guided by
local climatic conditions. Those that require protection in this
locality, particularly at night, it may be as well to mention, viz ,
Cape Crowned Crane, West African Crowned Crane, Stanley
Crane, Demoiselle Crane, Wattled Crane, and Sarus Crane ; these
are driven in pairs into houses at night after the ist of November
each year, and are only allowed to remain out when the winter is
well over. During the day we keep them in as little as possible,
although the houses are good in every way. By careful housing
during the winter you can keep the birds in good health and, as
the nesting season comes along, you stand a much better chance
of having nests with fertile eggs, a most necessary point to
mention. Under no consideration, while the birds are indoors,
place water or food on the ground, but put it into pans in a
convenient light corner, where the birds can see them well, and
raise them at least twelve inches from the ground, as by so doing
the birds cannot foul them. Bed down with peat moss, and do
not forget to have plenty of overhead ventilation, as well as
that from the windows, and when hard frost and perhaps deep
snow is on the ground admit as much sunshine as you can,
and all will go well. Should it so happen that the snow lies
more than two days, we sweep a good piece, say twelve yards

by four 3\ards or thereabouts in a sheltered corner, and this the
birds make good use of if let out.
The period of incubation of Cranes varies. The species
which have bred here are: Canadian, White-necked and Man-
churian, and incubation takes 30 days ; Wattled 36 days. A pair
of Stanley Cranes at present have a nest here with the usual
complement of two eggs ; they have been sitting 32 days, and
as we have no idea of the time these birds take to incubate, j^ou
can imagine our hopes and fears. Both male and female sit well
and take turn on the eggs. All the Cranes' eggs that I have seen
bear a strong family likeness and are small for the great size of
the birds ; the colour of the eggs varies slightly, and they are
deposited with the same regularity, viz., one clear day between
the first and second eggs. The nest is merely an apology,
a few bents of grass or any rubbish handy is pulled together ;
sometimes this is not done until the first egg is laid. The
Siberians take the most pains, and are not satisfied unless a
considerable heap is got together, especially if they can get
flags of any kind, which the}^ pull up by the roots. Owing
to their aquatic habits, the nest is built as near the water as
possible, hence the idea of a large nest to keep well above the
water-line.
Both species of Crowned Cranes have made nests this
year, and we have daily expected to see an egg from the Cape
Crowned (Grus chrysopelargus). These elegant creatures are a
joy for ever, when seen, as they are here, in the very best of
health and plumage ; they are perfectly tame, and are pleased
to welcome one and make friends at all times. The graceful
way in which they dance about to amuse one is most entertain-
ing; no matter how many people witness the performance, they
appear to enjoy laughter; in fact, the more you laugh, the more
they dance, bow, and skip about with half-open wings, showing
all their wonderful variation of colours. They may be very
highly recommended for any lawn or garden, being perfectly
harmless, and they do not dig up the turf like most of the
Cranes. The long life and hardiness of this family in confine-
ment should appeal to all lovers of birds who can afford to keep
them.

Practical Bird-Keeping.
My humble remarks will, I hope, be of help to attain
success, and are meant as such, not that I want to imply that
my way is the best, I merely state the conditions that answer
admirably here.
The call of the different species of Crane differs consider-
ably, no two are alike ; to describe them correctly requires the
skill of an artist, and it would be a complete failure on my part,
not knowing a note of music, to attempt it. The male and female
are so much alike that, unless you know what sign to look for,
it is a difficult matter to tell them. When the birds are calling or
showing fight the pair usually stands together and the female
holds her head quite upright, not a movement of her body takes
place; on the other hand, the male stands likewise, but at each
note he throws up both wings from behind, leaving his back and
tail quite exposed : this goes on for a minute or two with auto-
matic regularity. The fighting attitude of the Asiatic Crane is
most amusing: he stands quite still, with his great bill hidden
iu his tail and end of wing-feathers, and when about to be
attacked by anything, and the foolish being comes within
striking distance, out conies the bill like a flash of lightning,
and is used with terrible effect. This action puts one in mind of a
man drawing his sword from its sheath in haste to defend himself.
The males of the Demoiselle and Crowned Cranes are not
so easy to determine, one has to be guided by the action of the
birds : they usually are slightly larger, and with well-defined
lines of plumage and also the voice of the male is much deeper
in tone and more prolonged.
During the migration period, in spring and autumn, all
Cranes, without exception, get very excited in the hope of getting
away, making determined attempts to get on the wing, in spite of
being pinioned, especially if a strong wind is on. You will see
them go down wind to the extreme end of the enclosure, then
start to run and fly their hardest up wind, and very often clear
the fence and land in another enclosure, when they are promptly
attacked by the rightful owners. At these times the call is much
more shrill, the Sat us can be heard several miles away down wind.
The photographs of the Demoiselle Cranes, reproduced with this
article, was kindly sent by Mr. J. C. Phipups, of Knobfields, Wenhatn, Mass.
