AN EXPERIMENT IN PUFFINCULTURE

<bodyText confidence="0.9708187" page_id="56317308"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By William G. Conway
(Curator of Birds, New York Zoological Society, U.S.A.)
Scarcely an aviculturist exists who has not some idea of what a
puffin is, but very few have ever seen one exhibited in captivity, and
until August, 1957 , we had never exhibited a puffin at the New York
Zoological Park.
Three species of puffins are recognized : the Atlantic Puffin
(.Fratercula arctico ), ranging from northern Greenland and Franz Josef
Land south to Maine and Portugal ; the Horned Puffin (. Fratercula
corniculata) , breeding from the Bering Sea south to Forrester Island,
Alaska, and the Tufted Puffin (Lunda cirrhata) , found from northern
Alaska and Siberia south to California and Japan. Our experience
concerns the race Fratercula a. arctica, found from southern Greenland
and Iceland to Maine and northern Norway. Lockley places the
population of all races of the Atlantic Puffin at more than 15 , 000,000
and concludes that it is one of the most numerous of all Atlantic sea
birds. Of this number we claim two, and their story follows.
Atlantic Puffins are rounded, compact, extraordinarily tough birds
with a body about a Rock Dove and a half in size. During much of
the year they present a drab appearance : black with a white breast
; and grey face. The beak is high and laterally compressed but not
especially distinguished. With the advent of the breeding season all
this changes. The orange feet become brilliant scarlet and a horny
sheath grows over the bill, resulting in a huge affair which appears
to start at the top of the puffin's head and extends to the lowest
extremity of his short, round face. At this time, also, a fleshy, grey,
wattle-like triangular projection grows above the puffin's eye, while
below it a grey rectangle appears. The puffin's eyelids seem to swell
somewhat and ring the eye with a bright circle of red.
In the wild, puffins feed very largely on small fish of several species.

W. G. CONWAY-AN EXPERIMENT IN PUFFINCULTURE
They have attained considerable fame from their habit of returning
to the nest with a number of small fish held in neat formation,
crosswise in the bill. In contrast to some published accounts, however,
not all of these fish have their heads pointing in the same direction.
How the puffin manages to catch one fish and hold it so securely
while obtaining another is the problem. Actually, the puffin has i
considerable control over both mandible and maxilla, and an elastic, j
heavy " lip " at the corners of its mouth helps give it a very facile
food-gathering apparatus. While hard to describe, it is not hard to
see how a puffin can hold one fish in the back of its beak and catch 1
more in front.
Puffins nest in burrows and it is possible that they never see their
parents clearly, for the " puffling 55 stays in the burrow, which is
usually quite extensive and dark, and the parents walk down into the I
burrow to feed it. Instead of helping, or even driving the youngster
from the nest, R. M. Lockley has shown that parent puffins merely j
taper off in their feeding visits and finally abandon the youngster
altogether while it is still in the nest. This usually takes place about
the fortieth day of the chick's existence. After about ten days of
enforced fasting, the complaining chick leaves its nest burrow one
night and makes its way on foot to the sea. There it enters the water
and swims out on to the open ocean. Quite alone, it receives no help
or further feeding from its parents. Fifteen million puffins would
seem sufficient testimony that the puffin is well enough equipped by
nature to learn to live in one of the world's most rigorous environs
by itself.
On 30 th August, 1957 , we received a small shipment of puffins
through the efforts of Mr. Stuart Peters, of Canada. Our purpose
was to conduct an experiment with these birds to gain experience
with their needs in captivity and to find a practical method of keeping
them with an eye toward the development of a future " Puffinry
Work in various other zoos in the United States and abroad did not
appear encouraging. Hediger related the loss of puffins in Basle, and
we were acquainted with several other attempts to keep the species,
most of which did not end well. We hoped that nestlings, taken about
the time of the fast period and properly handled, would have a good
chance of survival. Accordingly, Mr. Peters collected a group of
nestlings and placed them in a plane late one night and the next
afternoon we had a dozen puffins. I should like to be able to say
that we reared them without trouble, and one just does thus and so.
Such is not the case. All but four of the puffins were dead within
30 hours of arrival. Each bird was very carefully autopsied but no
certain cause of death was established. Every bird appeared in
excellent condition with much surplus fat. Even on arrival the birds
had appeared in excellent health and, to date, we do not have a

good hypothesis for their death. The puffins were at somewhat
different stages of development, ranging from almost completely downy
specimens to well-feathered birds. The four survivors of this holocaust
were a mixture of the age groups represented, thus precluding the
development of possible explanations on the basis of age. We con-
cluded that puffins do not ship well under the conditions provided
and decided we would be wise to " break them off 55 at the point
of capture.
The four remaining birds immediately became the chief centre of
interest and feeding problem in the Bird Department. Force-feeding
the older examples proved a formidable job indeed, and we soon
found that small, whole fish were the only answer. After a week,
however, they began picking up these minnow-sized fish from small
dishes of water themselves, and it appeared that our problems were
mostly those of supply and demand. We found the birds sensitive to
interruption such as movement and noise, and at various times had
to stop carpenter repair jobs which occasioned pounding nearby.
We attempted to induce the chicks to take fish injected with vitamin
supplements with more or less success.
During this period of their lives our birds were kept in the head
keeper's office within a special wire-floored cage with movable parti-
tions. Each bird was housed separately and the appearance of this
unit was rather like that of a multiple brooder. We felt individual
compartments, offering a small area with enclosed back, top, and
sides, might promote a greater sense of security to burrow nestlings.
From the brooder we intended to move the young puffins to our
specially constructed refrigerated penguin quarantine cage with con-
crete pool as soon as we considered them well started on their food
and the younger individuals well feathered. Crowded conditions and
some unexpected problems on the waterfowl ponds made it necessary
to house sea ducks in the cooler, and thus prevented us from moving
our young puffins at an appropriate time. Not until October was
the cooler free for use, and by this time three of the four puffins
showed unmistakable signs of distress.
Breathing heavily, feeding but gradually losing weight, the puffins
displayed symptoms frequently associated with aspergillosis. The first
bird died on 11 th October. Autopsy revealed aspergillosis and results
were the same with yet another bird on 26th October. The two
remaining puffins were placed in our cooler, one showing considerable
distress. This bird and its apparently healthy cage mate were once
again subjected to constant force-feedings to avoid the inevitable
period of starvation stress while they learned to find their food in
new surroundings. In the meantime, their food had been changed to
one more practical for the zoo to obtain and considerably more
economical than the various minnow-sized fish which we had been

W. G. CONWAY-AN EXPERIMENT IN PUFFINCULTURE
using. Smelts, whole, such as fed our smaller penguins, were found
satisfactory despite their 4 in. to 6 in. size. We placed a few drops of
a multi-vitamin preparation on each fish. The ill bird was force-fed
daily through the first week in November. Eventually it became so
tame that it would sit upon its keeper's lap while being fed. Amazingly,
this bird recovered. While this specimen was not laboratory tested for
aspergillosis, its symptoms were identical with those of the two birds
which died with the fungus. While I am loath to suggest that I have
ever seen a bird recover from severe aspergillosis, I often wonder
about this little bird. Later, in conjunction with four Adelie Penguins,
some of which arrived with aspergillosis, these birds were carefully
tested for the disease. Cloacal, tracheal, and buccal smears were
taken and the birds were actually given treatment for aspergillosis
though all of the test cultures were negative.
Each of our puffins was assigned a number on arrival and careful
weight checks were used as an index of feeding and health as well as i
a guide to the need for force-feeding. On arrival puffin No. 1 weighed
274 gm., No. 2 weighed 197 gm. On 31st January, 1958, they weighed
respectively 450 gm. and 451 gm.
It takes puffins several seasons to attain full breeding plumage and ;
produce the huge, many-coloured bill sheaths or plates, which increase !
in size at least to the five-year mark and are shed each autumn. Our
birds' beaks have grown considerably and we are gathering photo-
graphs of them at various periods in the hope of following this process
through for particular individuals. Thus far they have shown little
red in their feet or beaks, which may reflect an artificial condition
suggesting that the food we offer is too low in carotenoids for them
to produce normal pigments.
We are also making a brief chronicle of the moult of our two birds
in the hope of gaining as complete a picture of puffin life as possible.
We were surprised, despite the notes of Salomonsen and Heinroth,
to find our birds entering a flightless moult in the middle of March,
before the breeding season. While, of course, our puffins are being
kept under highly artificial conditions and would not, in any event, be
old enough to breed, we were still quite amazed by their unusual
timing. Salomonsen comments on recovering puffins in flightless
condition in the North Atlantic during the same period of the year.
Despite our setbacks, we feel the puffin experiment a successful one
and think we may now know enough about puffins to keep them in
good health. In the near future we anticipate building a " Puffinry
It will be air-conditioned, somewhat cooled, provide an aquarium-
fronted pool and a land area which may be modified for burrowing,
and we will feed the puffins on supplemented fish with some shrimp
or other carotenoid-rich food.

I read with great interest the contributions on the above subject in
the last two issues of the magazine. The point is, what are we going
to do about it, or are we going to sit back complacently and wait for
the anti-bird keeping fraternity to act first ?
As Phyllis Barclay-Smith points out, there are many people who,
given half a chance, would prevent the keeping of any bird whatever
in captivity. These people have closed minds on the subject. They
will not listen to argument or logic. They are prejudiced from the
start and leave no stone unturned to throw the limelight on any
event which will reflect badly on aviculture. Let there be one case of
neglect or delay in transit of a consignment of birds and they seize
on it with enthusiasm and become almost hysterical in their con-
demnation of the whole practice of importing birds. Unfortunately,
such people have the weight of uninformed public sentiment behind
them. Ask any non bird-keeping person a spot question : is it or is it
not cruel to keep birds in captivity ? and I will bet that in ninety-nine
cases in a hundred he will, without thinking reply : "Yes, how would
you like to be shut up in a cage ? 5 5
Public sentiment or opinion--call it what you will--is a very
powerful force and in the face of it Governments are apt to make
laws which may be sweeping and comprehensive in their effect.
It only needs a few more cases like the affair at Nairobi to be brought
to light and public opinion may be so incensed that we may all wake
up one morning and find we can't get any more birds.
The obvious place to prevent the abuse of the bird trade is at the
source of supply. If the Governments of the countries of origin could
be persuaded to enforce regulations for the proper care and transport
of their birds, all would be well, but this would be a tall order. It
must be remembered that some species which we cherish over here
are considered vermin in their native habitats. I was once told that
Ring-necked and Plum-headed Parrakeets are such a pest in India
that it was considered more profitable to trap them wholesale and
consign them alive to Europe than to spend money on cartridges to
shoot them. Likewise we have all heard the tales of the appalling
suffering which must be inflicted on Australian birds by the deliberate
poisoning of water holes and the laying of poisoned grain to kill
cockatoos. If these stories are true, are the people who do this sort
of thing really going to care how the birds are sent away, or where
they go, as long as they are got rid of?
The second, but less effective way, is to tackle the problem at our
end--the receiving end. I say less effective because whatever regula-
tions are enforced about importation into the United Kingdom these

will not prevent abuses in other countries. Nevertheless, we would at
least be putting our own house in order.
It is no use appealing to the better natures of the dealers and
exhorting them to insist on minimum size cages, etc. I am not here
referring to the bona fide bird importers who have good reputations to
uphold, but there are, unfortunately, others who are only concerned j
with importing birds as cheaply as possible, and selling them as soon &amp;apos;
as possible, to obtain a quick financial return. Some sort of legislation ;
is necessary if these people are not to continue to bring the whole of
our hobby into disrepute.
All goods imported have to pass through H.M. Customs and it
seems to me that here is where some sort of regulation could be 1
enforced. Would it not be possible for the Avicultural Society to
draw up a set of rules on the lines quoted by Phyllis Barclay-Smith I
and advocated by John Yealland and submit these to the relevant
Government Department, coupled with the suggestion that any birds 1
imported under conditions not up to these standards be refused
admission to the country ?
How much better if these suggestions were to come from ourselves
as a responsible Society, than from " the other side ". At least we 1
should be showing our bona fides as genuine aviculturists. Moreover, j
and this is important, we should be more likely to obtain a favourable j
hearing if and when any law is passed.
Talking of " genuine aviculturists " brings me to another point, and
that is, that not nearly enough of us are making a concerted effort to j
breed birds and establish aviary-bred strains. The trouble is we never
wake up to the need to do this until it is almost too late. This is what
nearly happened with British birds, but for the timely formation of
the British Bird Breeder's Association. And look at parrakeets, when
the import ban was lifted a few years ago I actually overheard several
parrakeet breeders say that they had given up the commoner species
because " it would no longer be worth while breeding them "--
presumably not financially worth while ? How they must have
changed their tune when the ban was suddenly clapped on again !
Let us face it--nearly all the seed-eating birds and many insect
and fruit-eaters show a pronounced desire to breed in our aviaries
given the right conditions, but apart from parrakeets, pheasants, and
waterfowl, how many of us make a sustained effort to establish aviary-
bred strains of the " cheaper " birds ? Why not--because they are
too cheap ? Surely if a species is worth keeping at all, it is worth
breeding--not just once to say you have done it but regularly and
consistently.
I know we are all collectors at heart, we like to keep as many
species as possible, with the result that we tend to become "Jacks of
all trades, masters of none ". But if only more of us would specialize

and concentrate on trying to establish aviary-bred strains of a few
species which appeal to us like Teague with his Gouldians, Norris
with his Mountain Bluebirds, and Nicholson with Red-headed Parrot
Finches--these men are the true aviculturists--we could in time
become independent of importations except in special circumstances,
e.g. for a change of blood.
We call ourselves the Avicultural Society. As I understand it the
word aviculture means the breeding and rearing of birds, not just
the mere keeping of them. The Society offers medals for first
 |breedings--an excellent scheme, but why let it rest at that ? Too
many of us, I am afraid, having achieved success once are either
content to rest on our laurels or turn to other species, with the result
that the first generation of aviary-bred stock is dispersed and lost.
D. H. S. Risdon.
Dudley, Worcs.
I would like to add a contribution to the debate upon the subject
raised by our Editor in the September-October issue, but more par-
ticularly my intention is to put a query against two points submitted by
Mr. T. Spence in his comments on the original article.
In the November-December number of the Magazine, page 159 and
half-way down the page, Mr. Spence writes :--
" Incidentally, we owe a great debt to the R.S.P.C.A. for this hostel
and I fear that few of us recognize this." (He is referring to the hostel
run by the R.S.P.C.A. at London Airport where livestock is taken for
purposes of inspection, feeding, watering, etc., whilst awaiting either
owners to turn up or for further transport to other destinations.)
I suggest that whilst some very useful work is done in this way by the
Society, and possibly many instances of bad conditions are brought to
light and either remedied or greatly ameliorated, there are certainly
occasions where interference by officials of the Society or anybody else
can do much harm.
Have they any legal right to open boxes and handle animals which
are destined for other people ?
Supposing a valuable hawk escaped through such interference, and
savaged the Inspector or some other animal in the place ; who would
stand the blame ? Supposing a rare bird got away altogether, what
excuse could the Society offer to the person whose property the bird
was ? Supposing a very nervous bird, such as a wild-caught hawk
would certainly be, were to take fright and die in a fit through being
suddenly inspected by a human being at close quarters, would the
Society not be liable to be sued for heavy damages ?
Anybody who has experience of wild hawks or game birds will know

very well that I am not exaggerating this possibility of death or serious
injury from fright. The handling of these birds is the job of a very
experienced specialist, and in any case it is highly doubtful if a hawk
would feed on such an occasion, no matter how hungry, nor how tasty
the proffered refreshment. It is far better left alone and quiet unless 1
there is obviously something very seriously wrong with the package.
The second point in Mr. Spence's article arises out of his suggestion
that we should allow all sorts of other official inspections to bedevil our
lives.
On page 160, second paragraph, we read : "I believe that no one
should be permitted to import the fauna of another country unless the
accommodation the importer can provide is suitable."
(Splendid idea !--But who is to decide what is " suitable " ?)
" I feel that only people accredited by, and whose premises have been
inspected by, say, the Nature Conservancy, should be permitted to
keep the wild fauna of any country."
I will wager a hat that there are very few officials of any body,
Nature Conservancy included, who would be competent to decide
upon what is suitable accommodation for some hypothetical obscure
foreign bird. What is more than likely is that they would send someone
rushing off to the London Zoo for the necessary information, and we all
know that much of the Zoo accommodation is inappropriate !
Then we have to consider that the vast majority of birds imported are
brought in by dealers who always hope that these birds will soon be off
their hands. Are we to have a crowd of inspectors attached to every
dealer so that each person who buys a Waxbill can be followed home
and his arrangements for the bird inspected ?
My feeling is that we are much better off acting as our own police
force. We are the ones who know if a dealer is a bad egg, whose place
is dirty and who always has sick birds in crowded cages, and who is
mainly interested in the profit to be taken from his business. We are the
ones who decide whether to do business with him or to leave him to go
bankrupt. After all, these premises are already subject to official
inspection by law and it does not work ! Otherwise why are there still
thousands of smuggled lovebirds and parrakeets openly offered for sale
week by week ?
I certainly agree with Mr. Spence in his anxiety to see these bird-
traffic scandals cleaned up, but I submit that we do no good by seeking
more and more intrusion from Officialdom.
Let us rather educate ourselves thoroughly in the needs and general
details about a bird, so that when we do acquire one we already have
proper knowledge, and accommodation in which to look after it.

By E. N. T. Vane (Great Missenden, Bucks, England)
There has been a considerable hiatus since Peters' Checklist of the
Birds of the World , Volume III, covering the Psittacidae, was published
in 1937. During the greater part of this period little opportunity was
available for further review of the position, although it was obvious
that the scope of a work of such monumental dimensions was almost
certainly beyond the limits of the lifetime of any single individual
and eventually some amendments would be necessary.
Two rather obviously discordant elements stood out in his arrange-
ment of the White Cockatoos, namely the positions of (1) the Blue-
eyed Cockatoo, Kakatoe galerita ophthalmica (Sclater), from New Britain,
and (2) the Red-vented or Philippine Cockatoo, Kakatoe hamaturopygia
(Muller), from the Philippines. Dr. Hans von Boetticher, writing in
UOiseau in 1938, criticized these two points in particular ; he also
remarked upon the position of the Glossy Black Cockatoo, Calyptor-
hyncus lathami (Temminck). This paper only came to my notice quite
recently and prompted further inquiry which, with the assistance of
Mr. R. W. Sims, of the British Museum (Natural History), who has
kindly looked up many early references and checked these notes, leads
to the following conclusions.
The Cockatoos naturally fall into two main groups, the Black and
the White. Peters divided the former into three genera : (i) Probosciger
Kuhl, the Great Palm Cockatoos, (ii) Calyptorhyncus Desmarest, the
Black Cockatoos proper, and (iii) Callocephalon Lesson, the Gang-gang
Cockatoo. The White Cockatoos he arranged in one genus divided into
five sub-genera which will be referred to more fully later on.

Probosciger , which has a number of vernacular names such as Palm
Cockatoo, Great Black, Giant, Goliath, Aratoo, etc., is a mono-
specific genus of which five sub-specific or geographic races are
recognized. These races differ only slightly in size, except one,
stenolophus , which has a distinctly slender feather formation in the crest.
So remarkable is this genus that Boetticher considered that it may well
deserve an entirely separate sub-family. The generic characteristics of
Probosciger are : colour black, a bare pinkish facial patch, crest long
with slender lanceolate feathers, bill very large and deeply notched,
with the upper mandible much compressed and narrower than the

lower. Their range extends from the northern tip of Cape York,
Australia, throughout New Guinea and the surrounding islands
(Fig. i).
The second genus, Calyptorhyncus , was divided by Peters into two
sub-genera, ^anda and Calyptorhyncus. Boetticher, however, believed
that the Glossy Black Cockatoo (C. lathami in Peters), merited sub-
generic rank as the head was browner, the bill shorter and wider,
particularly in the lower mandible, he therefore revived Harrisornis ;
Mathews (Aust. Av. Rec ., 2, 1914). To add support to this contention,
Sir Edward Hallstrom has already recorded that he found the digestive
system of this Cockatoo to differ from other Black Cockatoos (Avic. Mag.
r 954, p. 163). The full title of this bird would therefore become
Calyptorhyncus ( Harrisornis) lathami (Temminck).
Thus, this genus would be composed of three sub-genera :--
Sub-genus 1. Z anc ^ a Mathews containing the White-tailed Black
Cockatoo, Calyptorhyncus baudinii Lear, from south-west Australia, and
the Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo, Calyptorhyncus funereus (Shaw), from
eastern Australia and Tasmania. These two species resemble each
other closely and may well be regarded as the two geographic repre-
sentatives of different areas. They differ in the colour of the auricular
patches and markings of the under-tail. Recently sub-species of
baudinii have been named, but as they only appear to differ in the size
or shape of the bill, it may be more satisfactory to regard them as
variations until more information is available, as has been suggested
by Ernst Mayr with regard to the " Triton " sub-species mentioned
later.
Sub-genus 2. Calyptorhyncus Desmarest, consisting of one species,
magnijicus. The Red-tailed or Banksian Cockatoos, of which four sub-
species or geographic races are accepted in various areas of Australia,
only differing very slightly from each other. The sexes differ con-
siderably in this sub-genus (Fig. 2).
Sub-genus 3. Harrisornis Mathews. The Glossy Black Cockatoo as 1
detailed above.
The generic characteristics of Calyptorhyncus are black colour, long
tails with outer feathers shorter, crest feathers short and broad. Bill
short, high, and very broad.
The third genus of Black Cockatoos is Callocephalon Lesson, which is
the well-known distinctive Gang-gang, a dark grey bird with the edges
of each feather pale bordered. In the male the crest is red with soft,
curled, rather fern-like feathers. The cere is covered and the tail
shorter. It is a mono-specific genus although a somewhat doubtful
sub-species is listed. Callocephalonfimbriatum (Grant) being the nominate
race (Fig. 3).

Peters placed the White Cockatoos in five sub-genera under one
generic group. First the Kakatoe Cuvier, in which were the Greater and
Lesser Sulphur-crested species, also the Great White, the Moluccan
and Blue-eyed Cockatoos and, for reasons known only to himself, the
Philippine Cockatoo. Secondly, the Lophochroa Bonaparte, the Lead-
beater's. Thirdly, Ducorpsius Bonaparte, the Short-crested Ducorp's,
Goffin's, and Bare-eyed Cockatoos. Fourthly, the Licmeiis Wagler,
Slender-billed Cockatoos, and finally Eolophus Bonaparte, the Galahs
or Roseate Cockatoos.
In the first place, Peters' choice of Kakatoe Cuvier as the generic name
is not accepted as correct by some scientists. Ernst Mayr (. American
Museum Novitates , No. 947, September, 1937) gave the following
reasons : " The generic name # Cacatua ' Brisson ( Orn ., iv, p. 204,
1760) has been in use in the ornithological literature for a period of
more than one hundred years. It is the name used in the Cat. Birds ,
in Sharpe's Handlist , in Salvador's Orn. Pap. Mol., and in every single
monograph of the parrots published during the last century. Recently
Mathews replaced it by Kakatoe Cuvier, which in my opinion is nothing
but a nomen nudum. I shall continue to use the generic name Cacatua
Brisson until more valid reasons for its rejection have been advanced."
He does, in fact, retain the name in his Checklist of the Birds of New
Guinea , 1941. This retention of the prior name is most helpful in
rearranging the classification of the White Cockatoos more satis-
factorily, as will be seen.
With regard to Peters' first sub-genus " Kakatoe ". Boetticher stated--
and he was undoubtedly correct in saying so--that he could not accept
Kakatoe ophthalmica (Sclater), the Blue-eyed Cockatoo of New Britain,
as a mere sub-species or geographic race of Kakatoe galerita (Latham) ;
ophthalmica does not have a narrow, upcurving crest, filamented when
erect, like other members of the galerita group. On the contrary, it has
a broad-tipped, rounded, and flat crest, which opens fan-wise when
erected, as in the Great White {alba) and Rose-crested ( moluccensis)
Cockatoos of the Moluccas. He therefore proposed to place these three
species in a separate sub-genus, Plyctolophus Vieillot, of which moluccensis
Gmelin was the type species.
His next step was to propose that the short-crested Philippine
Cockatoo ( hcematuropygia ) should be moved from its obviously incorrect
position here. So he suggested it should be placed in a more appropriate
position with the " Ducorpsius " short-crested Cockatoos, quite over-
looking the fact that hcematuropygia was, in fact, the type species of
Kakatoe Cuvier, which made such a revision impossible.
By reverting to the prior name of Cacatua Brisson, however, it is
possible to correct two errors in one change over. The White Cockatoos
may now be rearranged on the lines suggested by Boetticher as follows :

Their habitat extends through Australia, New Guinea, and the
surrounding islands across to the islands of the Timor Sea.
The Greater Sulphur-crested, galerita , includes the Triton Cockatoo
of New Guinea, of which form Peters listed no less than five sub-species.
Mayr has made a careful study of these birds and came to the con-
clusion that although individual specimens do vary in size or shape of
bill to slight degree, these differences were not constant, nor related to
any particular geographic distribution. Fie therefore combined them
once more as one sub-species, Cacatua galerita triton Temminck, adding,
" without forgetting that they differ in size considerably." This might
be a more satisfactory plan to adopt with the three Australian sub-
species, which again are all very similar, only varying in size of bill or
body size or length of wing. The skins found in museums are almost
impossible to separate definitely into distinct geographic races according
to their labels.
Of the Lesser Sulphur-crested Cockatoos, sulphurea , only one is
readily distinguished by the characteristic colour of the crest, namely
the Citron- or Orange-crested Cockatoo of Sumba, citrino-cristata. The
remaining five sub-species are island races, varying slightly in size, but
being insular types they are not subject to geographic overlapping and
there would be little likelihood of intergrading to make distinction more
difficult.

Body colour white with deep pink suffusion on underparts ; crest
again long and up-curving with filamented feathers when erect. The
bill is whitish and the cere covered with small feathers.
Leadbeater's (Major Mitchell's, Pink Cockatoos, etc.) appear to stand
between the black-billed, bare-cered white cockatoos and the short-
crested, whitish-billed, covered-cered cockatoos, having affinity to both.
Their territory is confined to the continent of Australia, where four
races are recognized ; all very similar (Fig. 9).
Genus III. -- Eolophus Bonaparte
Sub-genus 1.--Eolophus Bonaparte 1854.
The body colour of this sub-genus is grey on the upper parts and
rose-pink on the under parts. The crest is shorter and lies close to the
crown when depressed. Bill white, cere covered with small feathers.
The well-known Roseate Cockatoos of Australia (Galahs) were, in
Boetticher's opinion, entitled to sub-generic rank and he placed them
under Ducorpsius Bonaparte 1857, but Eolophus takes priority if the two
are to be united. Their unusual colour would, indeed, seem to justify
segregation. Three sub-species or geographic races are listed.
Sub-genus 2.--Ducorpsius Bonaparte.
Body colour white. Otherwise similar characteristics as above.
Species (i) E. ducorps (Bonaparte), Ducorp's Cockatoo from the
Solomons (Fig. 11).
(ii) E. sanguinea (Gould), Goffin's Cockatoo from Tenimber
(Fig. 12) and the Bare-eyed Cockatoo from Australia,
where three races are recognized (Fig. 10).
(iii) E. hrematuropygia (Muller) from the Philippines. Trans-
ferred from Peters' Kakatoe.
Genus IV. -- Licmetis Wagler
The characteristics of this genus resemble those of the foregoing, with
the exception of the unique bill which has the upper mandible greatly
elongated. This has an apparent use to enable the bird to unearth
certain roots which form part of its diet. It is confined to Australia,
where two local races are recognized under one species (Fig. 13).
One other doubtful problem remains. Should the Cockatiel,
Nymphicus hollandicus , be classified as a member of the Cacatuinae ?
Boetticher thinks not, he would prefer to return it to the Platycercinae.
However, the position is doubtful. No broadtail cock ever shares
incubation duties with his hen, yet all the Cacatuinae do so. Again,
Dr. F. H. Glenny is carrying out considerable research into the classi-
fication of the parrots by anatomical characteristics--the clavicles and
carotid artery formula--and he still places the Cockatiel with the

cockatoos. Pending some further valid reason to justify another
change over, it seems more satisfactory from present knowledge to
leave the Gockatiel among the cockatoos.

In August, 1949, the Copenhagen Zoo got eight young Snowy Owls
from Greenland. Four of them were presented to other zoos and four
birds remained in our zoo and later on proved to be two pairs. Each
pair was kept in its own aviary and we hoped that at least one of them
would breed. Sometimes in spring one female was seen sitting in a
corner of the aviary giving soft, clucking notes. We thought it was
an indication of breeding, but no eggs were laid.
Last winter we changed the females hoping that the new pairs
would breed. Unfortunately after a short time one female died.
In late April we saw the other female frequently sitting in a corner of
the aviary and in the middle of May she had eggs. We do not know
exactly when the first egg was laid as we would not disturb her, but
on 18th April there were two eggs. The eggs were laid on alternate
days until there were six round white eggs. The female started to sit
constantly on the eggs when the second egg was laid and she carried
out the incubation alone. No nest was made, the female had only
made a depression in the sand.
In the middle of June one young hatched. In all three young
hatched, the other eggs were addled. We do not know exactly when
the first young hatched as we would not disturb the female, but the
average incubation period is stated to be thirty-three days. The three
Snowy Owls were the first ones to be reared in our garden. The owls are
fed once a day with dead white rats, and the male brought the food to the
sitting female, passing it to her or laying it at the nest. The young were
fed by the female only while in the nest, and by both parents after they
left at about three weeks old. The parents tore out small pieces of
the rats and fed them to the gaping young.
At first the young had white down and when about two months old
they had their juvenile plumage and could fly. At present they resemble
the female, having white feathers with more or less brown bars. The
old male is pure white with a few brown spots and bars on the
upperside.
The Snowy Owls are the most attractive owls in our collection, on
account of their beautiful white plumage, their golden eyes, and
because they are largely diurnal. They can, however, be seen sitting
motionless for hours only now and then fixating flying birds.
Snowy Owls are usually silent, especially outside the breeding
season ; I have, however, heard the male's hooting, and low cackling
notes from the female when showing pre-coition display and low
clucking when sitting on the eggs. Further, I have heard cheeping
whistles from the owlets when begging for food with swaying heads and

it snaps the bill and hisses with lowered body, extended wings, and
raised body-feathers.

Despite the wet and cold weather which prevailed through the
spring and summer at Cleres, a satisfactory number of waterfowl and
game-birds have been reared in 1958. The young geese suffered
somewhat from the excess of rain, but some Magellan, Ashy-headed,
Emperors, and Snows survived. The ducks were more successful, as
they were kept indoors and without bathing water until they started
feathering, a method which proves very satisfactory in wet years.
Among them are three Sharp-winged, four Versicolor, two Cape
Teal, four Hawaiian, nine Philippine Mallards, four White-eyes, and
fairly large numbers of Bahama, Common Pintails, American and
Chiloe Wigeons, Black Ducks, Shovellers, Cinnamon Teal, Red-heads,
Rosy bills, Red-crested Pochards, Carolinas, and Mandarins ; four
Southern Pochards were the first bred at Cleres. A special mention
should be made of a pair of Brazilian Teal, wild caught birds, of the
lesser sub-species, which had lived at Cleres for seven years without
laying ; this year the female laid four clutches and twenty-three young
were reared.
Twenty Spicifer and seven white Peafowl were raised as well as
a few common ones, and Wild Turkeys. There were five Red Jungle-
fowl ; eight Blue Eared, four Versicolor, seven Elliot's, three Mikado
Pheasants ; two White-crested, seven Horsfield's, five Swinhoe's
Kalijs ; six Cheer ; one Grey Peacock Pheasant, and five Siamese
Firebacks, as well as Goldens, Amhersts, and Melanistic Pheasants.
Pairs of Palawan and Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants have been
added to the collection, as well as Edwards' and Brown Eared Pheasants
sent from America for a welcome change of blood.
A number of Lovebirds of different species also bred ; Fischer's in
particular, of which we keep about twenty pairs in a large grassy
aviary, produce over a hundred young every year.
A number of Toucans, Rollers, Starlings, and other exotic birds
have been recently acquired as well as Lories and other parrots, and
the collection keeps growing.
My Los Angeles aviaries now number sixteen. I found that doves
and finches bred better if fewer pairs were kept together. For reasons
of overcrowding, no Mountain Witches, Bleeding-hearts, Bartlett's,

Chiriquis, and Blue-headed Ground Pigeons have been reared this
year. I hope they will do better now that such pairs have been isolated
from other large doves. On the other hand, one pair of the rare and
nearly extinct Grey-headed (G. caniceps) has reared five, one egg per
clutch ; one pair of montana , eight ; one pair of martinica, four ;
Brush Bronze-wings, three. Small doves have done well : eight Blue
(pretiosa ), twelve Peruvian, four Cape, eight Pigmy, and many
Diamond Doves.
A happy surprise was the rearing of a young bird by a pair of
Moustache Ground Pigeons (G. mystaceo ), a now very rare species
from the Lesser Antilles, after six years of sterility. In the same large
aviary, a similar accomplishment was performed by a pair of Philippine
Pheasant-tailed Doves, also after six years of inaction. One must
never lose patience with birds ! Jamaican Violet-necked Doves also
reared two young. The various finches, much overcrowded, did not
do very well, the only interesting happening being the rearing of
three Australian Blood Finches (P. phaeton ).
Besides many beautiful Tanagers and Sugar Birds, which I have
mentioned before, newcomers worthy of notice are a pair of the
beautiful Orange-breasted Green Cotingas ( Pipreola jucunda) and a
male of Rieffer's (P. riefferii) from Colombia, several Long-tailed
Manakins from Costa Rica, and ten Sunbirds sent from Kenya and
presented to me by Mr. Maurice Machris ( JVectarinia johnstoni, N.
famosa, jV. tacazze, JV*. pulchella). These Sunbirds do very well out-
doors the year round in the mild climate of Southern California. Each
pair, or individual, is kept in a different aviary which they share with
doves, finches, and many other birds, even Humming Birds (Black-
chinned and Costa's). The latter and the Sunbirds are fed on a
mixture of honey and beef extract, which does not spoil before twenty-
four hours, adding to this diet small insects, which are rather scarce
in the winter but abundant during the warmer months. It is amusing
to witness the incessant chase they give them.
Ringed Teal, Hooded Mergansers and Ruddy Ducks now live on the
stream. The American Flamingos, which had become hopelessly white
through lack of carotene, have now regained their full pink colour
since carrot juice (preserved) and grated fresh beet have been added
to the soaked biscuit. It was interesting to notice that a pink suffusion
was already showing after a few weeks, apparently without a moult.

20 H. WACKERNAGEL-COLOUR FEEDING OF CAROTENOIDS IN BIRDS
SOME RESULTS WITH COLOUR FEEDING
OF CAROTENOIDS IN BIRDS AT THE BASEL
ZOOLOGIGAL GARDEN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992648951219512" page_id="56317329"  page_num="20" year="" vol="">
By Hans Wackernagel (Basel, Switzerland)
It is known that most of the yellow, orange and red pigments of the
bird's skin and plumage are carotenoids. It is further known that these i
carotenoids are not synthesized by the bird. They have to be present in
the food and are merely deposited in the bird's body either unchanged
or transformed to a certain degree. These findings account for the
much regretted fact that so many birds which are brilliantly coloured
in nature fade in captivity. The bird-keeper who wants to retain these
colours in his captive animals is faced with the problem of finding;
the right carotenoids and supplying them in adequate amounts to the;
birds in his care.
In the Basel Zoo work was started on these problems in 1956 and a
few experiments in this field are worth mentioning. The most
satisfying results were obtained in a group of Sunbirds (Nectariniidae)
of East Africa. Here we added to the liquid food, which consists of a
solution of honey, meat extract, condensed milk, and vitamins in water, &amp;gt;
the synthetic carotenoid, canthaxanthin, from the firm F. Hoffmann-
La Roche and Co., Ltd., Basel. 1 This deep orange-red carotenoid,
which occurs in nature in the mushroom cantharellus was used in a
1 per cent stabilized dry form. A small quantity (the amount held on j
the point of a knife) was dissolved in \ litre of liquid.
The following birds responded to this supplementation of their food.
After moulting on canthaxanthin a male Beautiful Sunbird ( Nectarinia
pulchella) developed a good breeding plumage with the red patch in the
centre of the chest. This red patch, however, was not so red as in
nature, but seemed to be just canthaxanthin-coloured. At the time of
writing this bird is again in its non-breeding plumage. Before the use
of canthaxanthin its breast patch was only dull brownish in colour.
The second bird to respond was a male Variable Sunbird ( Cinnyris
venustus jalkensteini) . After the moult its breast and belly, which had
been whitish, became golden-yellow. This is, as can be ascertained by
the illustration in C. W. Mackworth-Praed and C. H. B. Grant's
Birds of Eastern and North-Eastern Africa and by a skin in the Basel
Museum, just the natural colour. In this case the bird transformed the
orange canthaxanthin into a yellow compound apparently natural to
this race.
The last case was a female Scarlet-chested Sunbird ( Chalcomitra

\ senegalensis). This bird died and an immediate examination revealed
quite clearly that the body fat was dyed orange. Dr. A. Winterstein of
the firm F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Co., Ltd., was so kind as to
examine the specimen further. He found 50^ of unchanged canthaxan-
thin in the adipose tissue by way of chromatographic and spectroscopic
determination. The plumage of the female Scarlet-chested Sunbird is
of olivaceous colour and does not display any yellow or red. It can be
mentioned here that Mr. G. Glatt, Birsfelden, Switzerland, has had
quite spectacular results by using canthaxanthin in the food for red
Canaries (Hybrid Canary X Red Siskin, Spinus cucullatus ).
To another foodstuff, a fat-soluble extract from alfalfa (commercial
product), which is rich in yellow carotenoids, two species, which always
faded badly up to the present time, reacted favourably. These are the
Scarlet Cock of the Rock ( Rupicola peruviana sanguinolenta) and the
Scarlet Ibis ( Endocimus rubra). They are each represented by one
individual at the Basel Zoo. The addition of the above-mentioned
extract to their food produced a very marked deepening, although
no full development, of the red colour of their plumage.
Finally, a visible improvement in colour was attained in the Basel
group of Flamingos. These birds profited from a supplementation of
their food with a Scottish seaweed meal. The cause of this improve-
ment is not yet clear. It could be the carotenoid fucoxanthin which is
still present in fresh seaweed meal. Seaweed meal which has been
stored for a long time does not seem to have any effect. We tried this
seaweed meal since other foodstuffs rich in red carotenoids, e.g. fresh
crustaceans, were not available in large quantities. Recent observations
point to the fact that alfalfa extract probably gives a favourable effect,
too.

The response to the registration forms sent out in the May-June
issue of the Avicultural Magazine has been good. Most collections
have now been recorded, although a few forms are still coming in.
From the following table it at once becomes apparent that there are
really only adequate stocks existing in this country of the four common
species of pheasants, Silver, Reeves', Golden, and Lady Amherst's. Of
the rarer species the few that are left are highly inbred and no amount
of re-mating amongst existing collections can rectify this.
The number of representative collections in the British Isles at the
moment probably does not exceed half a dozen and it is clear that

forms will cease to exist in this country. Where these birds are also
scarce in their natural range, their extinction cannot be long delayed
unless numbers are artificially propagated. Pheasant breeders in the
United States of America are, of course, doing wonderful work in the
propagation of certain species, but this does not remove the threat of
extinction from several forms.

I would like to remind members that subscriptions to the scheme are
now due and should be sent to me at " The Malt House, Barford,
Warwickshire The subscription is 5^. per annum expiring on the
31st day of December in each year.
Full details of the scheme were set out in the January-February,
1958, number but if any member of the Society wishes to obtain par-
ticulars, I will willingly forward them. Members of the scheme are
entitled to send in to me as often as necessary lists of birds wanted or for
sale or exchange by them, and I will do my best to put them in touch
with others who may have the birds they seek or want the birds they
have for exchange or disposal.
Last year quite a number of members of the Society joined and many
took advantage of the offers, but to make the scheme the success which
everyone hopes it will be many new members are required. It is,
therefore, up to the members of the Society to give their support
generously.
This year the colour plate fund has benefited by #3 gs. 3 d., the
surplus income.

The sixty-fifth meeting of the Club was held at the Rembrandt
Hotel, Thurloe Place, South Kensington, on Monday, 12th January,
1959, following a dinner at 7 p.m.
Chairman : K. A. Norris.
Members of the Club : Miss J. Barnes, A. W. Bolton, Miss K.

Members of the Club, 38 ; guests, 24 ; total, 62.
The Chairman welcomed four overseas visitors : Mr. Jiri Felix,
Chief Zoologist at the Prague Zoo, Mr. Zdenek Veger, President of
the Association of Exotic Bird Breeders of Czechoslovakia, Mr. Howard
Jarman, sometime President, Avicultural Society of South Australia,
and Mr. Paul Hansen, of Odense.
Mr. Philip Wayre showed two coloured films, " The Gyr-Falcon in
Iceland " and " Barnacle Geese in South Uist
The first was made in the north-east of Iceland in the summer of
1956, in collaboration with Dr. Gordon Jolly. It opens with views
taken on the road from Reykjavik to Akureyri, followed by shots of
Harlequin Ducks, Long-tailed Ducks, Eiders and Red-necked
Phalarope. These sequences are followed by shots taken from a hide
at a Gyr-Falcons' eyrie in the Odadahraun Desert. Seven eyries were
found of which four were definitely and five probably occupied. The
film includes sequences of both birds at the nest and feeding the young.
There are also shots of Ptarmigan at the nest, taken in the same area.
This is believed to be the first full-length film on the Iceland Gyr-
Falcon to be produced.
The second film deals mainly with the flocks of Barnacle Geese
wintering on the Machair of South Uist, but also includes sequences of
Grey-lag Geese, Curlews, Dunlin, Whooper Swans and other birds in
the area.
The Chairman, himself well known for his photographic studies of
birds, was able to use his expert knowledge to summarize the highlights.
The quality and interest may be judged from his remark that he
understood Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, unavoidably absent, had seen
these films seven times and would, doubtlessly, be disappointed at
missing the present showing.

Brian C. Turner sends further news of his Virginian Cardinals
(see 1957, 175). He writes : "Again this past season resulted in
two nests. In the case of the first three young hatched from three eggs.
One youngster soon disappeared and the remaining two died (or were
killed) before fledging. The second nest had three eggs, one of which
I placed in a Greenfinches' nest. This egg hatched but the chick died
within twenty-four hours. The other two eggs hatched but again
were only alive for about a week. Unfortunately the hen Cardinal
broke a leg and died last month."

The Rev. J. R. Lowe reports an interesting experience with a pair
of Half-masked Weavers or, as he refers to them, Ruppell's Weavers.
In late August the male began to weave a nest with fresh, broad grass
blades : it was suspended from the wire-netting roof of an open
flight. The female took no interest in the weaving, which was com-
pleted in about the second week of September, nor did she appear to
examine the nest until it had turned from green to brown. The
entrance to the nest was from below, and the nest cavity was to the
right in the form of a pouch. Consequently, it was very difficult to
determine what was happening inside. The first of four or five eggs
was laid probably on the 16th. On 3rd October examination with a
finger revealed no eggs but a mass of young. The female fed well,
using many mealworms : the male did not visit the nest or take any
interest. The weather was appalling, continuous heavy rainstorms.
Some protection was provided by a sack fastened to the roof of the
flight, but the nest was frequently covered with raindrops which ran
down the sides. The nest was not lined in any way, but the weaving
had been beautifully done and was very strong and efficient.
Unfortunately, after a stormy night on the 5th-6th a young one was
found to have been thrown out of the nest.

necked Screamers (Chauna chavaria) took up housekeeping in a nest
of their building. This nest had been constructed atop a 30 ft.
pine tree within full view of the public visiting our attraction.
Nesting began about 24th October ; apparently only two eggs were
laid. On or about 18th November the parent(s) were first observed
feeding by regurgitation (as best could be observed from the ground).
The young leaped or were pushed from the nest (as with Wood
Ducks) on 28th November. There were two young ; no sign of

egg-shell or other eggs was found in the nest. The " chicks " crossed
about 150 feet of ground, thrashed across a 20 ft. canal, and took
up residence on an island in our waterbird pond. The parents
remained with them at all times. The young were feeding on
vegetation immediately after reaching the island.
The chicks were described by our aviculturist, Mr. Ralph Currier,
as yellow, down-covered (no evidence of " quills "), flightless, and
non-swimming (actually having negotiated the water in a most
unswimming-like manner !).
Early on the morning of 2nd December, one of the young was
found, freshly dead, within the 8 ft. diameter " corral " we had
constructed for their protection. Death may have been due to the
crushing force of a parent Screamer's foot. Currier removed the
other chick immediately, and hand-raised it in our incubator house.
This survivor appeared to be flourishing on a diet of grass (which was
consumed in prodigious quantities), high protein meal, and mineral
supplements. It was found dead on the morning of nth December.
We certainly hated to lose the little fellow ! Mr. Currier has hope
that the parents will attempt another nesting in the near future as
they have mated several times since the loss of their young."

The title-page of this book is somewhat misleading for it was trans-
lated and adapted from the Danish text written by G. Mandahl-Barth ;
the name of the translator is not mentioned. The illustrations, all in
colour, are from paintings by Henning Athon and 157 species are
depicted ; the majority show males in breeding dress, but in a number
of species the females are also included. A general dissertation on the
care of cage-birds is followed by notes on the species under review ;
these include a description of the range and habitat, and food, nests
and eggs in the wild with some information concerning the birds in
captivity.
This book is attractively presented and the process used for the
illustrations is most effective.

A STUDY OF BLACKBIRDS. By D. W. Snow. George Allen and
Unwin, Ltd., London, 1958. Price 21s. net.
Dr. Snow has for four years made a close, thorough, and compre-
hensive study of the Blackbirds in the Oxford Botanic Garden, an
area which is urban at one end and almost rural at the other. As he
states in the introduction to his book A Study of Blackbirds , during this
time he was able to collect information on nearly a hundred colour-
ringed birds of each sex living in or near the Botanic Garden, and, of
these, the histories of about forty birds of each sex were recorded in
some detail.
It is specifically stated that the book does not set out to be a mono-
graph, but it certainly contains a wealth of information about this
familiar bird and deals with plumage and moults, food and feeding
habits, threatening and fighting, pair-formation and pair-bond, and
care of the fledged young, to mention only a few aspects. In the chapter
on " Breeding Success " Dr. Snow mentions the various hazards to
eggs and young and found that exactly 50 per cent of the nests started
in the Botanic Garden and immediate surroundings produced fledged
young. Carrion Crows were the chief enemy, but cats not so serious,
and the author mentions that, though this was not the case in the
Botanic Garden, small boys are important egg-predators of suburban
Blackbirds in some areas.
The illustrations, by Robert Gillmor, whose work is already known
to the readers of the Avicultural Magazine, are delightful.

ENCOUNTERS WITH ANIMALS. By Gerald Durrell. Rupert

Hart-Davis, London, 1958. Price 16 s. net.
This book is mainly a collection of amusing and sharply observed
glimpses of some of the more curious creatures occurring in the con-
tinents of Africa and America. It is divided into four parts, background
for animals, animals in general, animals in particular, and the human
animal. The first part contains accounts of the succession of life
observed respectively in the " Black Bush 55 of West Africa and the
Lily-Trotter Lake in British Guiana and includes an entertaining
description of the way a Jacana mother protected her brood from a
Cayman. The second part deals with animal courtships, animal
architects, animal warfare, animal inventors, and vanishing animals.
Aviculturists will find the descriptions of courtship in the King Bird
of Paradise and the Satin Bower-bird of special interest, also the
chapter on animal architects and the way some of the more remarkable
birds' nests are constructed. As might be expected, the greater part of
the book is concerned with mammals, but these charming stories will
appeal to naturalists of all kinds as well as to the general reader. The
excellent illustrations are executed by Ralph Thompson.

I was most interested to read Mr. J. C. Laidlay's article in the recent issue of the
Magazine, more particularly as I was one of the many people who were not lucky
enough to acquire a pair of the goslings.
One of his remarks has given me food for thought and might well provoke discussion
among those of us who keep waterfowl. I quote : " waterfowl usually do not breed
successfully when closely related and if the practice is continued over a period of years,
complete infertility results."
It is well known that wild geese in a state of nature tend to remain in family parties
in between breeding seasons. That is to say the Pink-foot goslings hatched last spring
will have migrated south with their parents and will remain with them, barring
accidents, until next spring when the old pair return north to start another family. It
would, therefore, appear very likely that in the wild state a large number of pairs are,
in fact, brother and sister. It would be most interesting to have the Wildfowl Trusts'
view on this point.
It must surely be the case also that when one acquires a pair of ducks or geese
(I am speaking only about the ornamental varieties, not domestic breeds) from one of
the establishments which breed them, it will be the rule rather than the exception that
a brother and sister pair will be sent. In the rarer species, like Maned Geese, where
very few are bred each year, this must surely be self-evident.
I shall be most interested to hear any comments from other members on these points.

COLOURS OF MALE AND FEMALE WHITE-CAPPED REDSTART, LOSS
OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY, FOOD FOR LORIKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989575857142857" page_id="56317340"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
I have just read Dr. Searle's most interesting letter in our Magazine. I can assure
him that the cock and hen White-capped Redstart are alike in plumage. I watched a
pair of these lovely birds feeding their young in a nest among rocks by the side of a
mountain stream at a place called Gulmarg above Srinagar in Kashmir, and both
birds appeared alike, but what a pity to keep these lovely birds in captivity at all.
In Dr. Vevers' letter on the loss of red colour by birds in captivity, I was particularly
interested in the statement that some red browns owe their colour to melanins for Red
: Avadavats sometimes go black in captivity, but how can we keep the red ? Many years
! ago I wrote a letter to our Magazine on melanism in Avadavats in captivity. So far
as the loss of red in Bulbuls is concerned, does not the correspondence show how unwise
1 it is to generalize and say " Bulbuls do or do not lose their red in captivity ". I must
have seen hundreds of Red-cheeked Bulbuls wild and have kept many in captivity and
my experience is that the red on the cheek of the Bulbul becomes lighter and the area
of colour smaller in birds kept in cages. It would probably help members if Mr. Boosey
would tell us the conditions under which he kept his Bulbuls and the food he gave
them. Also my experience is that when wild the feathers on the vent, or the seat of the
trousers, of Red-cheeked Bulbuls is not red at all but a lovely deep salmon and that
colour also faded in captivity. Will Mr. Boosey tell us whether the red on the seats of
his Bulbuls' trousers is red or scarlet or a deep salmon ? It may have been the bright
Indian sunlight which coloured my vision.
Further, have members noted how the orange on the face of the Orange-cheeked
Waxbill fades both in area and in colour in captivity ? Mine when first imported
really deserved their name. The orange on the face looked like orange sealing wax,
yet after the moult, though kept in an outdoor aviary, the orange faded into a small
area of brown and I saw the same thing in the case of Orange-cheeked Waxbills in the
bird house in the London Zoo. What is Mr. Boosey's experience in this matter ?
I was also very interested in the account of the breeding of the Yellow-backed
Lory. Mr. Risdon writes that every conceivable variety of food was offered.
I remember many years ago in an article on the breeding of Swainson's Lorikeets,
Dr. Amsler describes how he fed his birds in war-time, the 1914 war, on ground rice
pudding made with milk and honey-sugar. I used to get this rice mould made by our
cook in India, though with brown sugar instead of honey-sugar, and I reared
successfully some Blue-winged Parrakeets which would have died if reared on the
ordinary satto or gram flour which food rears the Ring-necked successfully.
Dr. Amsler's article is well worth reading.

THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ENTERITIS
Following our recent correspondence in the Magazine in respect of enteritis I have
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.8552633" page_id="56317340"  page_num="31" year="" vol="">
had a further letter from Professor Kirkpatrick in which he points out that one of the
statements contained in his letter in the November-December, 1958, Magazine, has,
in the light of some information recently published been rendered incorrect and he
feels that the correction should be drawn to your attention.
He states :--
" In the Journal of Wildlife Management, 22 ; 446-449, appears an article,
' Ulcerative Enteritis in the Pheasant, Blue Grouse, and California Quail,' by Buss,
Conrad and Reilly. The new fact is that enteritis was found in a flock of young
pheasants densely concentrated at the New York State Delmar Game Farm.
Until this report, we did not know that pheasants were susceptible."

CORRESPONDENCE
THE LOSS OF RED COLOUR BY BIRDS IN CAPTIVITY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986910846153846" page_id="56317341"  page_num="32" year="" vol="">
Recent correspondence on the subject of loss of red colour by birds kept in captivity i
leads me to write of my own experience with Choughs (Pyrrhocoraxpyrrhocorax). It is,
well known that in the case of wild adults the bill and legs are bright red. When I
first started keeping Choughs, my specimens were fledglings which, of course, lacked ;
the red colour, the soft parts being a brownish black, with a trace of yellow. As the
birds matured, a dull red colour was assumed, but it never approached the intensity
of red characteristic of the species.
My attention was drawn to this by the intense colour of birds exhibited in the
National Cage Birds Show, which, incidentally, are almost always over-coloured and
also the bills are usually overgrown. I wrote to one or two of the exhibitors and was
informed that red pepper was included in their diet.
My birds were eighteen months old when I commenced adding small amounts of
red pepper to their food. The birds soon developed a rich red colour of the soft parts,
which quickly surpassed the natural depth of colour, taking on a decidedly purple cast.
This unnatural tint waned when the food was discontinued but to make quite sure that
the development of the red colour was not an age factor coincident with my colour
feeding, no more colour food was fed for twelve months. Very slowly the intense red
faded giving place to the previous dull red colour level. I might add that during the
breeding season, just after colour feeding, a nest was built by the birds, but no eggs ;
were laid. During the subsequent winter one bird died.
The red colour did not reappear during the next breeding season, but again a nest
was built. Colour feeding was recommenced, and the rich hue returned after a few :
weeks. Uncertain as to whether or not the colour food was harmful to the birds I
discontinued feeding it, which was followed by a gradual loss of colour. It now
happened that a second bird died, after being ill for some time, steadily losing strength, i
despite the fact that the body condition seemed good. Shortly after, another bird
became very unwell, wheezing to such an extent that its whole body vibrated and an
audible rattle could be heard as the bird gasped for breath, during which time the bill
was held partially open revealing saliva bubbling in its throat. In my opinion it had no
hope of recovery. As a " kill-or-cure " measure I immediately started colour feeding i
once more, when to my surprise a rapid recovery was made. Coincidence ? Perhaps. |
However, I now include red pepper mixture regularly in the diet and so far have had \0x25A0
no more casualties. The amount is limited to just sufficient to maintain a normal degree
of coloration. As a matter of convenience my three Fieldfares have the same staple diet
and are remarkably healthy. This season they were actually carrying nesting material, j
Their bills tended to develop a slightly rosy flush when the colour food concentration
was high, but were otherwise completely normal. My Virginian Cardinals have access
to this food and have nested for the past four years although no young have reached
maturity. The red colour of the male, although not as brilliant as a wild bird, is, J
nevertheless, rather better than one frequently sees in specimens which have been cap-
tive for some years.
From the foregoing I conclude that the feeding of capsicums to Choughs is definitely
beneficial and, of course, does produce a natural degree of coloration if used judiciously.
I have ascertained that the red pepper mixture which I use contains 45 per cent
Spanish red pepper and 45 per cent paprika, which is a rich source of vitamin C.
I would endorse the comments of Dr. H. Gwynne Vevers that the myth that red foods
produce red colours is quite false, unless they contain substances which are either the
pigments found in the birds or substances from which these pigments or similar ones
can be synthetized by the bird's system. Clearly, wild Choughs do not have access to
capsicums and I would be very interested to know what food source supplies these
requirements in nature.

Dr. K. C. Searle asks for information on the White-capped Redstart (Chaimarrhornis j
leucocephala ). This bird is also known as the White-capped Water Redstart, for it
frequents streams in the Himalayas and western China. Whistler says that it breeds at
elevations between 6,000 feet and 16,000 feet, descending to the foothills for the winter.
The sexes are alike in plumage.

The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Council to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not, in the opinion of the Council, be known to have been
previously bred in captivity in Great Britain or Northern Ireland. Any Member
wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed account for publication in the
Magazine within about eight weeks from the date of hatching of the young, and
furnish such evidence of the facts as the Council may require. The Medal will
be awarded only in cases where the young shall live to be old enough to feed
themselves, and to be wholly independent of their parents. The question of
awarding a Medal for the breeding of local races or sub-species of species that
have already been bred shall be at the discretion of the Council. No Medal can
be given for the breeding of hybrids.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avicultural Magazine
before it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of
the young, and be of value as a permanent record of the nesting and general habits of the
species. These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the
Medal is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Council shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have
been awarded as possible.
The Medal is struck in bronze (but the Council reserve the right to issue
it in silver in very special cases) and measures &amp;lt;z\ inches in diameter. It bears on
the obverse a representation of two birds with a nest containing eggs, and the
words " The Avicultural Society--founded 1894 ". On the reverse is the following
nscription : " Awarded to [ name of recipient ] for rearing the young of [ name of
species ], a species not previously bred in captivity in the United Kingdom."

The firm of P. Sluis was originally established at a small shop and factoiy
in Amsterdam, in 1823, by the great-grandfather of the present Piet Sluis,
and is believed to be the oldest established firm of Specialist Birdfood
Manufacturers in the world. They were certainly the originators of
the complete ready to use Special Birdfoods, which are obtainable in no
less than thirty different countries in the world to-day, and which,
although often imitated, have never yet been equalled.
44 Greenstuff " for birds
All birds need a daily allowance of " Greenstuff ", a new P. Sluis product
consisting of the choicest dehydrated Dutch vegetables and salads,
including carrots, lettuce, and spinach. " Greenstuff " contains the
essential vitamins of fresh green food, and should be given to both
softbills as well as hardbills. It should be mixed with their normal food.
" Greenstuff " saves you the trouble of hunting for fresh greenfood
for your birds--always difficult in winter.
Packed in airtight polythene bags at Is., and obtainable at all P. SLUIS'

{Pitta sordida cucullata)
By D. M. Reid-Henry (Woodford Green, Essex, England)
This beautiful bird hails from the jungle-covered hills and mountains
of Assam, Burma, Malaysia, and Siam.
Like most of the family it is a creature of the undergrowth where it
occupies its time in scuffling about amongst the wet and decaying
vegetation in the search of insects and grubs, spiders, worms, and
small reptiles. These, with a few berries and other fruit, represent its
diet-sheet. When appetite is satisfied the bird finds a perch on some
fallen log or moss-covered boulder and spends considerable time if
undisturbed preening or just sitting still.
When alarmed it slips quietly away, flying low for a short distance
to a more secure position. The usual mode of progress for pittas is by
means of a succession of prodigious hops with intervals between, when
they stand erect on their long legs to listen or to look for food. They
do not leave the forest undergrowth from choice during the day, but
at night they mount high into trees to roost.
In a previous article, when I wrote of the Bengal Pitta (Avicultural
Magazine, Vol. 64), I mentioned much in the way of general details
about these birds, and I will content myself and, I hope, the readers
by simply referring to that article. What would apply in the case of
that bird also holds good here, at any rate as regards habits and
treatment in captivity.
However, as pittas of one sort or another are now more easily
obtainable than they have been in the past I would like to recom-
mend them to any serious aviculturist who has some experience of
keeping softbills. They do equally well in either planted aviary or
a large cage provided they are kept warm and with a soft floor. A good
insectivorous food supplemented with snails, centipedes, mealworms,
or any other garden-inhabiting gentry will keep them well satisfied,
whilst a barrow-load of dead leaves (preferably moist and well decayed)

along with some rotting wood will give the owner some fine chances
to watch the bird in action. Without this natural rubbish the bird
will probably spend the day hidden as far from view as it can escape.
I only once possessed one of this species--in Calcutta, but I have
seen many in other peoples' possession, and it was from one such bird, a
perfectly tame and confiding creature, that I was able to make the
drawings for the accompanying coloured plate.
About this plate I would like to make one point. Somewhere
along the line of reproduction the green of the back has become too :
light. There is considerable difference between the bluish-green of
the underparts which is a rather pale colour, and the dark, slightly
slaty-green of the back and wings. The illustration does not show this
contrast at all well.
There are three races of this pitta in Malaysia, and altogether about
eight have been separated.
Pitta sordida mulleri which breeds in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo,
has a black crown. P. s. bangkana , the form found breeding in Banka
and Billiton has brown on the sides of the crown.
P. s. cucullata, the subject of the plate, comes from the north of
the range for the species, but migrates into many areas occupied by
other races. In all the brown-headed forms, the base of the crown
feathers are black ; so that some confusion may arise in identification
when the feathers are puffed up, because the black bases then become
apparent and a more or less distinct black line through the centre of
the crown from bill to nape appears. It is this feature which I have
tried to bring out in the plate, and is very clearly to be seen when the
bird is at rest.

K. G. ROTHWELL-IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS 35
THE IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN
PARRAKEETS

<bodyText confidence="0.989778266666667" page_id="56317398"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
By Dr. K. G. Rothwell (Leicester, England)
A few years ago I attempted the task of forming the nucleus of a
modest collection of parrakeets. This presented quite a difficult
problem for good quality birds were both rare and expensive. I have
always been interested in the old inscriptions on ancient tombstones,
yet they tell you little of the character of the departed, for all the dead
are good it seems--and so it is with birds. I have been introduced
to the migrant species ; this is usually a breeding pair of birds that
spend one season in one aviary ; they are reluctantly parted with
and spend the next season with you. So you may learn at first hand
the real reason why their former owner denied himself the privilege
of a longer acquaintance.
As it was very difficult to obtain the birds in this country my mind
turned to the possibility of importing a few pairs. A few inquiries
to the more experienced and wiser members of our Society met with
a discouraging response. I was treated to blood-curdling stories
as to the frightful losses I could expect, even as high as 50 per cent
unless the birds were accompanied by an experienced aviculturist.
A rough calculation of the wages of such a person, even if he could be
found, persuaded me that this was hardly feasible. Money calculations
of this type do influence me I find, and so I abandoned the idea.
My ideas of importing the birds were soon to be revived, however,
for when I visited the aviaries of a member I was shown a pair of birds
in really lovely condition which the proud owner had recently brought
over from Australia. I felt that what he had achieved I could try to
emulate. The very first step I felt was to try to prophesy the main
causes responsible for a high mortality, I tried to forget the fate of most
prophets, at least burning at the stake was unlikely I hoped. At
the worst I could only lose my money and this was penalty enough.
I felt the main causes for a high mortality were as follows :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.565726222222222" page_id="56317398"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
1. The birds may be freshly trapped and therefore not used to the
diet offered them in captivity.
2. The birds may be ill or suffering from incipient disease which
was masked.
3. Immaturity possibly was responsible for some losses, for the
resistance to infection in all very young creatures is less than in
more mature ones. But neither did I want old and ailing birds.
4. Overcrowding and unsuitable cages took their toll.
5. The most difficult problem was the likelihood that a percentage
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.91107" page_id="56317398"  page_num="" year="" vol="">
would fall ill en route and that these in the absence of expert
attendance would be more certain to die than to recover.

36 K. G. ROTHWELL-IMPORTATION OF AUSTRALIAN PARRAKEETS
A series of lucky chances provided the answer to the first points.
I was able to stipulate certain conditions and to have an entirely
independent witness to see they were carried out.
Only birds that had been confined in an aviary for a minimum
of six weeks could be sent. They were then examined by a qualified
person to see they were free from infection, of good quality and size,
and, finally, feeding freely on the staple seeds. They were then placed
in the special cages for a period of two weeks to accustom them to
their new quarters. The birds were separately caged and the cages
of a definite size. Finally, for the last three days before departure the
birds were placed on an aureomycin powder, glucose, calcium lactate,
and vitamin B complex. To this was added a high protein supplement.
I was ready to try my chance on a sort of pilot scheme, I thought
the best thing was to select four pairs of birds, all from different
genera, as representatives of the rest. I placed the order and sent
the money and settled down to a very uneasy four weeks. The vessel
carrying the birds had been carefully selected and the attendants,
although perhaps inexperienced, were full of enthusiasm. The great
day finally arrived and I was delighted to find all the birds safe and,
what was more, in really wonderful condition. They all settled down
well and, except for the hen King which died, they are still fit and well.
This then brings us to last year when the project was far more
ambitious for I included orders for some friends and for two or three
zoos. As the prices of the birds are affected to our advantage by an
increase in number I would like to pay tribute to the zoos for their
support.
By using the regime as roughly outlined the mortality was reduced
in the main to less than 1 per cent. There were, however, three
exceptions to the rule : Rock Peplars, Crimson-wings, and Kings.
This next year I hope to improve on this record by dramatically
changing the method in respect of these species. One particular
shipment was disastrous, but it was in part due to the fact the birds were
sent in pairs and they were very immature, thus where one fell ill its
companion soon followed the same track.
Surprisingly the Grass Parrakeets are excellent travellers. Not one
single bird was lost either in the preparation or en route , indeed those
that arrived in May, wet and cold though it was, went immediately
to nest.
The Psephotus group are also fine travellers as well and this includes
the Hooded. One of the two pairs was in immature plumage and
not so fit as the adult pair, but in the event have caused their owner no
anxiety.
The cockatoos from the impressive Funereal to the Roseate, except
for one unfortunate accident where a hen had her neck broken, all
arrived in fine fettle. The Leadbeater's being very vigorous.

S. T. JOHNSTONE-NOTES FROM THE WILDFOWL TRUST 37
The Broad-tails, including the Brown's, Pennant's, " 28," and
Bauer's, Yellow, Green, and Golden-mantled Rosellas did very well
indeed and, but for the last shipment when it was getting rather late,
all arrived quite safely.
Lorrikeets are, in spite of their diet, particularly good on this
regime and none has been lost either en route or subsequently.
They seem to withstand the rather close confinement exceedingly well.
I feel these birds merit greater interest for they are so hardy, and if
they do fall ill they are easier to medicate.
Undoubtedly the Rock Peplars are the fly in the ointment, out of
ten consigned only three arrived safely, and yet they were in first-class
condition. I am quite unable to explain this phenomenon. The record
with Crimson-wings and Kings is better, but not yet quite as good
as I would like.
I am still trying to analyse the results and to draw conclusions.
I offer these notes with all deference and modesty and hope they
offend no one. I hope in the end to acquire enough knowledge to
be able to make the importation of birds less hazardous for the birds
and thus enable us to establish aviary strains of many of the species
of cockatoos and parrakeets that are increasingly threatened in their
natural environment.

By S. T. Johnstone (Slimbridge, Glos., England)
In spite of the appalling summer of 1958, we had our most successful
breeding season yet. Over ninety forms of waterfowl nested and
eight-four kinds were reared ; the number of birds was over 800 at
Slimbridge and 300 at Peakirk.
First rearings included Black Brant Branta bernicla orientalis and
New Zealand Scaup Aythya novaseelandia. The Mallards were well
represented, eleven forms having bred. Among the more interesting
species produced were Magpie Goose Anseranas semipalmata , Bewick's
Swan Cygnus columbianus bewickii, Chinese Spotbill Anas pcecilorhyncha
zonorhyncha , Brazilian Teal Amazoneita b. brasiliensis, Goosander Mergus
m. merganser , and Red-breasted Merganser Mergus s. senator . Hartlaub's
Teal Cairina h. hartlaubi also bred but no young were reared ; the female
of a full-winged pair in our small aviary laid three clutches, but made
no attempt to incubate. Twenty-four eggs were laid ; fertility was
very low and only five weakly ducklings hatched, none surviving more
than a week.
On 12th May, 1958, a Black Brant made a scrape, right in the middle
of the greensward where visitors may walk amongst the birds, and laid
its first egg. The egg was removed and a wooden facsimile used to

replace it. The next day the goose decided to move to a new site and,
again right in the middle of the closely cut grass, laid her second egg.
On the four subsequent days four more eggs were laid. The gander !
was very aggressive to all who approached his mate. The goose
covered the eggs with a liberal amount of down ; their average size
was 7*32 X 4* 82 cm. and weight 96 grammes. Three of the eggs were
fertile and a small hen was used to incubate. The pipping took place
on the twenty-fifth day and three babies hatched on the twenty-sixth.
Unfortunately, one gosling was crushed in the sitting box and as a
precaution the two remaining goslings were put under a bantam that
had been hatching some Wood Ducks. These dark grey balls of fluff
with slightly paler cheeks had as an early diet minced hard-boiled
egg mixed with chopped grass, clover, and water-cress. This mixture
was sprinkled over turkey starter crumbs. For the first four days the
babies were kept on grass in a covered brooder, but as they became
stronger and the weather improved, they were allowed free range
over an open pen. Their foster-mother became very attached to them
and drove off all winged interlopers.
Every Hawaiian Goose Branta sandvicensis outside the Hawaiian
Islands has been bred from the two females which came to Slimbridge
through the munificence of Mr. Herbert Shipman, of Hilo, in April,
1950, and the male which followed at Easter, 1951. Unfortunately,
the discovery that the first two geese were not a pair was not made
until they both laid in 1951 and, although the male was sent from
Hawaii with the utmost expedition, by the time the two females laid
their second clutches he was in full moult. This gander, a truly regal
bird, we named " Kamehameha 55 and his consorts " Kaiulani 55 and
" Emma ". In 1952 " Emma 55 laid her first egg on the 18th February,
followed a week later by " Kaiulani Both geese laid two clutches
and altogether nine goslings were hatched and reared. Our general
practice of removing the eggs from the parents and incubating them
under bantams--thus inducing the goose to lay a second and some-
times a third clutch--has been followed with the Ne-ne. Clutches have
varied between three and six eggs ; these are white, the average size
being 80 X 50 mm. and the average weight 145 grammes.
It is found that a Silkie bantam-cross foster-mother is most
satisfactory. These birds are relatively light in weight, yet have a
large egg-covering capacity and are generally given three goose eggs
to incubate. The incubation period varies between twenty-eight and
thirty-two days.
Although actual hatching seems to be more difficult than in other
species and the goslings initially weaker, it has been our experience
that the survival rate is considerably higher. Initial feeding has been
induced with the same diet as that described for the Black Brant.

completely by turkey starter crumbs and a bunch of water-cress is
tied to the brooder. This diet is continued for six weeks, after which
the goslings lose interest in the water-cress and are content to crop
the grass on which they are raised.
A strange characteristic has occasionally appeared, in that some of
the goslings have had down of a cottony texture, instead of the normal,
soft fluffy kind and this has given them a peculiarly bedraggled
appearance ; there has, however, been no difference from normal
in these birds after feathering.
The difference in climatic conditions between Slimbridge and
Hawaii during the breeding seasons is emphasized by the fact that
goslings have been hatched here when there were two inches of snow
on the sitting-boxes.
The numbers of goslings reared annually to date are as follows :

Several pairs have now been established with other collections,
notably by Mr. Terry Jones at Leckford, where he has most success-
fully bred from one pair for the past three years ; he now has two
pairs and others are at Mr. Delacour's park at Cleres in France, at
Rotterdam, at Basle Zoo, at Whipsnade, and in America under the
care of Dr. Dillon Ripley, of Yale University. Those at Slimbridge
now number fifty-three, and though a flock of twenty-two may usually
be seen by visitors not far from the entrance gate, the majority are
kept carefully segregated in pairs in different pens so that the breeding
of the two strains descended from " Emma " and " Kaiulani " may be
controlled.
Recent additions to the collection, which at the beginning of 1959
comprised 160 forms, include Laysan Teal Anas platyrhynchos laysanensis

SOME BREEDING RESULTS AT KESTON--
SEASON 1958

By Edward J. Boosey (Keston, Kent, England)
I am writing to record several breeding results of particular interest
here at the Keston Foreign Bird Farm during the past season.
One of these was a " First ", namely the rearing of two young ones
by a pair of the very rarely imported Purple Grenadier Waxbill,
Granatina ianthinogaster , of which I will say no more here, as I have
already given a full account of this event in a previous issue of the
Magazine.
Another breeding result of more than usual interest was the rearing
of two young ones by a pair of Amethyst Starlings, a species which has
only once been bred before in this country--by the late Dr. Amsler
in 1935--who, however, did not specify whether his birds were of the
typical form Cinnyricinclus leucogaster , which is found north of the
Equator, or C. 1 . verreauxi , a sub-species inhabiting South Africa, often
known as Verreaux's Starling. Apparently the only difference between
the two is that the male of the latter has the outer edge of the two
outer tail feathers white, and when we recently caught up the cock
of our pair to take its photograph, we found that this was so in its
case, so ours are Verreaux's Starling.
I do not propose to go into details of their breeding, as
Mr. Cummings, who looks after them, has written a full account for
the Magazine. I think perhaps the most interesting thing was the
fact that their nest, in a Grass Parrakeet type nest-box, consisted
entirely of freshly gathered green leaves.
I am particularly glad to be able to record the rearing of six young
ones--in two nests of three each--by our pair of Mountain Bluebirds,
Sialia currucoides. The young ones were reared almost entirely on
gentles and mealworms, and the parents were obtained from, and bred
by, Mr. Kenneth Norris, who has had such remarkable breeding
success with this species.
A pair of African Grey Parrots reared a fine and, I should say,
exceptionally large brood of four young ones. We do not know their
ultimate fate as they were all stolen two or three weeks after they had
been taken away from their parents.
A male Festive Amazon mated to a rare female Red-throated
Amazon, Amazona collaria, reared three young ones which, like
most hybrids, were particularly good specimens. They were
intermediate in size between their two parents and all, rather
surprisingly, took entirely after the male in appearance. There is
considerable disparity in the size of the parents, the Festive being
one of the larger Amazons, while the Jamaican is one of the smallest
members of the family. They are altogether an oddly assorted couple,

the hen being the most timid creature imaginable, while the cock is
extremely bold and ferocious.
Our pair of Senegal Parrots again reared three young ones, as they
did in 1957.
After a lapse of two years or so, we again bred Layard's Parrakeet
Psittacula calthorpae. Five young ones were reared, the female parent
of one of them having herself been bred here. The original and, I
believe, only other person who has bred Layard's in this country, is
Mrs. Darnton, of Sissinghurst Court, Cranbrook, who was awarded
the Society's Medal.
Lutino Ring-necks did well, and two of the young ones we had kept
from previous years moulted out cocks, so we now have a second pair
of lutinos, as well as a male lutino mated to a female blue, through
which we hope eventually to breed albinos.
The hen blue Ringneck of the late Duke of Bedford's original pair
is now mated to one of her sons, and reared a splendid brood of five
young ones. Her original mate died through an accident after we had
had them here for three breeding seasons, during which they reared
broods of one, four, and five, so the old hen, since she has been here
at Keston, has altogether hatched and reared fifteen young ones.
It may be of interest to note that one of her sons, temporarily mated
to an ordinary green hen, reared three young ones, all green of course,
but one of them, which we have kept, has the wings evenly speckled
with yellow, forming more or less two bars.
Our beautiful little cock pure lutino Plum-head (about whose
progress in the way of breeding quite a few people have written to
enquire), in his second season with his first mate, reared one young one
until it was almost fully feathered, when it died in the nest ; shortly
afterwards the hen escaped and was killed by a cat. Then the only
hen we were able to obtain for him had such badly frostbitten feet
that they were mere stumps and, although she went to nest, the eggs
were clear--which was hardly surprising. Now we have managed to
obtain an excellent hen for him with a full complement of toes, and
we hope they may be successful, as the cock has at any rate proved
that he is fertile, which is not by any means always the case with
rare colour " sports ".
A male yellow Red-rumped Parrakeet bred here about two years
ago has developed into an unusually coloured specimen, as he has the
yellow of the lower breast and belly quite thickly speckled with red
feathers, and this year we have mated him to a hen with a considerable
amount of red on the rump. It seems that yellow Red-rumps have
reached the stage where they are starting to mutate further and it is
perhaps not too fanciful to envisage a red-bellied yellow Red-rump
in the not very distant future, which would be a very striking bird.
Other psittacine species bred included Golden-mantled Rosella,

green- and blue Masked, and also Peach-faced Lovebirds ; Roseate j
Cockatoo ; and many thousands of Budgerigars in all their
innumerable colour varieties.
Interesting fairly recent acquisitions in the parrakeet line include j
half a dozen of the rarely-imported Slaty-headed Parrakeet, Psittacula
schisticeps , of which unfortunately only one has turned out to be a
female. We have also obtained pairs of the imposing Rameron
Pigeon, with its striking bright yellow legs and beak, and the Scallop-
necked Pigeon, Columba speciosa.
The latter is a very fine species which is seldom imported, and the
accompanying photograph of one of ours taken by my partner,
Alec Brooksbank, is an excellent likeness. There is also a good colour
plate of the bird in Aviculture , Vol. 111, facing page 640, but it hardly
does justice to what it better describes in the text as the " feathers
round the neck with white spots and regularly margined with metallic-
green and amethystine reflections producing a scaly appearance ".
Also the head and wings appear chestnut brown in the illustration,
whereas they too, are more accurately described in the text as " maroon
with purple tinge Thus I think it will be seen that the Scallop-
necked is one of the most richly-coloured of the grain-eating pigeons.
I have recently added two pairs of birds to my private hobby
collection of non-psittacine birds--namely Peruvian (Green) Jays and
Knysna Touracous. The Green Jays have the generic name of
Xanthoma and inhabit South America and they are rather smaller and
slimmer than our native jay as well as quite unlike it in colouring.
The Peruvian Jay, Xanthoma yncas, has the front of the head, cheeks,
and throat black with bright violet-blue markings and quite a large
frontal tuft or crest of the same colour and a golden-yellow eye. The
back of the head and nape are ivory white. The back, wings and central
tail feathers are green and the under parts yellow. A nearly-allied
species the Venezuelan Jay, X. caeruleocephala , differs only in having
the back of the head and nape blue instead of white, while the Mexican
Jay, X. luxuosa , has the under parts green, and no frontal tuft.
I think it is very interesting that my pair of Peruvian Jays, which
I believe had been in their previous owner's possession for a couple
of years or more, have changed colour in captivity exactly as a Hunting
Cissa does ; that is to say the green parts of the plumage have gone
blue and the yellow parts creamy white. The female is distinctly
smaller than the male and they are a very affectionate couple, the
male frequently displaying to his mate. This is the most curious
performance : first he pecks the perch sharply several times then turns
sideways towards her and, standing on his toes, blows himself up to
almost twice his size, and with head down and beak wide open looks

as though he was going to be sick ! Instead, however, strange sounds
emerge and these can be anything from a loud rattling noise to a sweet
if rather strangulated whistle, after which he returns to normal.
The Knysna Touracou, Turacus corythaix , has the feathers of the crest
tipped with white, and the usual beautiful carmine-red wings, and
comes from South-east Africa. Touracous, despite their rather
deceptively mild and pigeony appearance, seem nevertheless to be
wolves in sheeps' clothing--as Donald Risdon told me he found with
his Hartlaub's. It is only fair to say, however, that this, as I can say
from experience, does not apply to the Purple-crested Touracou, but
this bird belongs to a different genus, namely Gallirex. Nor does it
apply to the Senegal Touracou, Turacus persa , whose murderous ten-
dencies seem confined to killing their young in the nest and this not
always, as they were successfully bred on more than one occasion by
Delacour.
My own experience of keeping Touracous is confined to the Purple-
crested, of which my pair were always most affectionate to each other,
and now the Knysna. My pair--at least I hope they are a pair as they
certainly look like it--were caged separately by their previous owner,
but as we had a large aviary with a really roomy heated shelter in
which to house them, we decided to try them together. They were
put into it one morning and seemed delighted to be together, running
up to each other and sitting side by side gently pecking at each others'
beaks before separating and going their various ways about the aviary.
This happy state of affairs continued all day and they were finally shut
into the shelter for the night.
The following morning, however, disclosed a very different picture :
The cock was bouncing happily about from perch to perch, but there
was no immediate sign of the hen, until she was discovered sitting on a
small perch high up in one corner, looking thoroughly dejected and
with blood on her forehead. She had obviously been attacked by the
cock and had to be hurriedly removed to a cage in a heated birdroom,
where she made a complete recovery and she now occupies a separate
aviary adjacent to his.
Since writing the above, I have added a pair of Azure-winged
Magpies, Cyanopica cyanus cooki , to my collection and I am delighted
with them. They are found in South and Central Spain as well as
parts of Portugal, and are true miniature magpies, with delightfully
slim, stream-lined figures and beautiful pastel colouring. The wings
and tail are delicate powder blue, while the under parts are stone-grey
gradually shading into pure white on the throat and sides of the neck.
The upper part of the head is shiny jet black, the long bushy feathers
forming a partially erectile crest, and being as sharply divided
horizontally from the white area below as to remind one of the head
of a tern. These magpies have a curious distribution, for besides the

We purchased a pair of Amethyst Starlings Cinnyricinclus verreauxi
from a well-known exhibitor eighteen months ago. The cock bird is
now in full colour with the full white breast and underparts and
amethyst-blue head and back. I should imagine it was a young bird,
for apparently the amethyst and blue feathers are replaced gradually
by pure amethyst as the bird gets older. This process is slowed down
in this country by the colder climate.
The hen is brown on the head and back with speckling on the white
breast and underparts. Young birds leave the nest in similar garb to
the hen and consequently it is not easy to sex hens from immature
cocks. The latter have a clearer speckling than adult hens which
conversely have a more suffused breast, off-white in colour, but this
is difficult to tell when there are only a few to look at. They look
rather like the English Thrush in colour and size.
This strong colour distinction between the sexes is unusual in the
Starling family, whose sexes are generally alike : The Amethyst also
lacks the inquisitiveness and intelligence and mimicry of the Starling
family. Its vocal powers are comparable to the English Starling, a
quiet flute-like whistle and a two syllable cc whee-oo " being the most
frequent notes. If excited, both sexes will raise one wing and then the
other in quick movements.
Their diet in captivity consists of fruit--apple, pear, grapes (chopped
up) and chopped up date--insectivorous mixture and live-food. In
the wild state they congregate in flocks after breeding and live to a
large extent on fruit and berries. We found that when the young had
hatched, the parents forsook all fruit and fed their young and them-
selves entirely on live food--in this case gentles and mealworms in
equal parts. According to books of reference they behave the same
way in the wild state, foraging more for grasshoppers, etc., when
breeding.
The first four to five months we had the pair, the hen was very
aggressive to the cock and I was afraid that they might have to be
separated. This may be explained by the possible difference in their
age and condition. There is occasional bickering even now they are a
mated pair, but the cock never gives way--the hen usually starts
this nonsense.

In the spring of 1958, they were transferred to a planted aviary
with a shelter attached which they could have to themselves and I hung
up outside on the front of the shelter, a small Grass Parrakeet-type
nest box with natural bark round the entrance hole. Inside I had
fixed a coconut husk--this filled half the nest-box and made it easy
for them to jump in and out. I was not aware that they were nesting
until several times I caught the hen flying quickly up and down the
flight and the cock started watching her, raising his head and uttering
his notes more frequently, meanwhile raising first one wing then the
other in quick succession.
As is usual when breeding insectivorous birds, one always sees both
cock and hen sitting around, when one appears, and looking confirmed
non-breeders, so one is usually at least a week out as to when they
really started breeding or building. However, finally I caught the
hen flying up and down with her swift direct flight and carrying a large
green leaf in her beak. I provided the normal nesting material, hay,
feathers, moss, etc., but they were completely ignored. She calmly
stripped three small privet bushes of all their green leaves, and started
on a box bush and phlox plants growing in the aviary. She filled up
the nest-box to a depth of one and a half inches with these fresh green
leaves.
I did not look into the nest box, for I consider this a very unwise
policy, and judged as to when and if anything was happening by
watching their diets. Eventually I noticed the quantity of gentles
they were consuming was increasing. Normally they hardly touch
them, but prefer mealworms and fruit and insectivorous mixture, but
I provide them none the less, for fruit-eating and insectivorous birds
sometimes have a strange habit of suddenly changing their preferences.
When I discovered this, I kept a potful of gentles by them all the time,
putting a handful of mealworms in it twice a day. The hen was a
tireless feeder and spent most of the time in the nest-box, staying off
for very short periods and would then fly back to the nest while one
was watching, with a beakful of live food. The cock very seldom went
into the nest-box and fed the young, but was very solicitous in watching
the nest site from a distance and following the hen when she came out.
I never noticed him on top of the nest-box at all, similar to the behaviour
of other species of starling. His main duties seem to be as watchdog.
Amethyst Starlings nest in holes of large trees high up in thick forest
and I should imagine this would play an important role against
predators in the wild state.
Finally the amount of live food consumed decreased and, as so
often happens, the two young fledged during a week of almost
incessant rain. We were undecided as to whether to manoeuvre the
young birds into the shelter with their parents and shut them in at
night, or not, but decided to leave well alone, for they might have

neglected the young if there were any interference. The parents were
extremely anxious if anyone went near the aviary, when both cock
and hen would fly up and down swiftly, uttering distress call notes.
As it happened, if a slight difference in size is anything to go by, the
two young ones were a cock and hen and about a fortnight after
fledging, the hen caught a chill roosting out, and died. They never
made any attempt to go back into the nest-box at night. The other
youngster, I think a cock, with clear body markings, is now about
six months old and a picture of health and is living on the normal
fruit diet of the adults.

By H. Poulsen (Copenhagen, Denmark)
In our bird-house, which was built in 1933, there is a large room for
parrots. Until a year and a half ago the parrots were kept in the
traditional way in rather small cages of about 1 m. X 1 m. X 1 m., placed
in two long rows, one on top of the other. In each cage were one or two
birds in accordance with the temper of the individual parrots. In front
of the cages at a distance of 1 m. there was a glass partition dividing
the parrots from the public ; this was made at the instigation of the
health authorities to protect the public from possible infection from
ornithosis.
There has always been a great deal of trouble with the keeping of
the parrots in these cages. Very often some of the parrots became
aggressive towards cage-mates and had to be removed ; other birds
bit or plucked off feathers from themselves or their cage-mates so that
they became more or less naked, especially on breast and back.
These are well-known troubles to parrot keepers, judging from all the
inquiries from people who ask us for advice on this matter. These
bad habits are caused by the inhibition of the natural activities of the
parrots when they are kept closely confined in cages. Then they begin
performing waving movements of the head, plucking of feathers,
and screaming and showing more than usual aggressiveness.
Such parrots as Amazons and Grey Parrots take much better to
cage life than do other species, but, nevertheless, they have too little to
do and tediousness makes them more loquacious ; they pay more
attention to sounds around them and are more inclined to imitation,
which is an advantage to their owners. When kept in this way one
has to pay attention to the parrots very often or else it is cruelty.
Sometimes larger parrots are kept chained to a perch, but to my mind
this is also a cheerless way in which to keep parrots, and also inhumane
treatment for such active birds.
We thought it would be much better to keep our parrots in a mixed
company in a big aviary where they could fly, but we were a little

anxious considering how aggressive our parrots were, especially the
larger species. In the summer of 1957 we turned our whole collection
of parrots into a large aviary (18 m. X 8 m. X 7m.) with iron framework
and wire netting. This aviary is placed just outside the parrot-house and
was formerly used for Ibises, Spoonbills, and waders. The first day the
keeper was in the aviary the whole day in order to prevent the parrots from
damaging each other, but nothing happened and up till now we have
; only had a few accidents with quarrelling birds. We have protected the
! parrots from rain by covering the back of the aviary and some part of
the roof with transparent plastic, and a high tree outside the aviary
gives sufficient protection from the sun.
The vegetation in the aviary consists only of grass because the
parrots damage all trees and bushes ; oak trees are used for perches and
several nest-boxes made of hollowed-out tree trunks are placed all
round.
There have not yet been any breeding results. This is partly due
to the fact that we have only a single bird of some of the species and
in other cases we do not know if the two birds we have are male and
female ; as is well known, it is very difficult to distinguish the sex in
many species of parrots.
At first, after we had put the parrots into the aviary the birds only
climbed the netting and the trees. Not until a month later did they
begin to fly and now they are very often seen flying. The plucking
of feathers eventually ceased and the birds attained an excellent
appearance, except a few obdurate feather-pluckers which we had to
remove. The aggressiveness also disappeared, birds which formerly
could not be kept together are now the best friends and are nearly
always seen near each other. This, for example, is the case with a pair
of Hyacinthine Macaws. Nor do the parrots scream so much as pre-
viously and only some of them come up to visitors who like to talk to
them. They live their own life, occupied with nibbling the branches,
digging in the earth, climbing, flying, preening feathers of their mates,
sunbathing, etc. The only inconvenient thing in keeping all these
parrots together is that some of the macaws sometimes bite the
long tail-feathers of other macaws so that they break.
From the middle of October until the middle of May the parrots
are placed in the earlier mentioned room in the bird-house. In this
room the small cages have been broken down and instead of the cages
there is now a large aviary (13 m. X 3 m. X 3 m.) and a smaller one
(3-5 m. X 3 m. x 3 m.) for smaller species which are kept in a smaller
outdoor aviary during the summer. There are windows in the roof
and in the south wall so that the birds can get some of the scarce winter
sun and the temperature is about 16 0 C. Both here and at the outdoor
aviary visitors sit and enjoy the many-coloured bird-life ; the public
is much more delighted in looking at the parrots than before.

the national exhibition of cage birds
The fifteenth National Exhibition of Cage Birds and Aquaria was
held in London, at Olympia, on 8th, 9th, and 10th January, 1959,
the numbers and variety of the foreign exhibits being of the usual
high order.
The classes for the more commonly kept small finches, buntings,
waxbills, weavers, and so on were as usual very well supported,
making a fine display.
There was a particularly interesting bird in the class for whydahs.
This was what is known in South Africa as the Purple Widow Bird
and was originally named Microchera haagneri by Roberts in 1926.
It was later known as Prosteganura haagneri and in the revised (1957)
edition of Roberts's Birds of South Africa it is stated : " This bird is
known only by two males, one captured at Bulawayo and the other
purchased at some South African port by the crew of a Japanese ship.
None has been found since and they are now generally considered to be
hybrids." This exhibit won the first prize in its class and the special
prize for the best small seed-eater. It is hoped that a note on this
whydah and a photograph of it will be supplied to the Magazine by
the owner, Sqn.-Ldr. C. Everitt.
There was a good class of cardinals and grosbeaks, Mr. R. C. J.
Sawyer's Rose-breasted Grosbeaks winning first place and Mrs. K. M.
Scamell's Yellow-billed Cardinals being second. The grosbeaks were
also adjudged the best of the large seed-eaters.
In the class for " all other seed-eaters not larger than a Java
Sparrow ", Mr. G. E. Whitmore's Red-faced or Orange-winged
Pytilias (P. afra) were placed first, a Purple Grenadier Waxbill (Sawyer)
being second.

A pair of Cape Sparrows (Whitmore) won the small class for seed-
eating birds larger than a Java Sparrow. Two birds of paradise ,
comprised the next class, a Twelve-wired (Sawyer) beating a Red
(Whitmore). There was a good class of humming birds, a Frilled
Coquette (Sawyer) winning ; also gaining the prize for the best foreign
bird and other special prizes. Others were Mrs. D. Dineen's Blue-
breasted, second, and Mrs. D. K. Draper's Red-throated Sapphire,
third.
There was a fine array of sunbirds, Mr. A. T. Worrall's Malachite
being first, Mrs. Scamell's Tacazze second, and Mr. Sawyer's La
Touche's third. A Wedge-tailed (or Orange-breasted) was also
shown.
A Yellow-winged Sugar Bird (Mr. J. Howard) won a good class of
these birds, with Mrs. Scamell's Blue second and Mr. M. C. Harris's
Black-headed third.
The class for Zosterops and Pekin Robins was won by Mrs. Dineen's
Indian White-eyes, Mr. Sawyer's Red-sided being second. Mrs. Scamell
won the first three prizes in the class for the smaller tanagers with a
Blue-crowned Chlorophonia, a Golden Tanager, and a Mrs. Wilson's
respectively. Others of interest were a Silver-throated ( icteronotus )
and a Bonaparte's ( hirundinacea ). The larger tanagers (with the bulbuls
and shamas) were headed by Mr. Dunmore's Black-faced Grey
Tanager, an Indian Shama (Mrs. Scamell) being second, and a
Brown-eared Bulbul (Mr. V. P. Labrum) third. The next class was
won by a Loo Choo Robin (Sawyer) with a Rufous-bellied Niltava
(Mrs. P. Henderson) second, and a Narcissus Flycatcher (Whitmore)
third. A Plumbeous Redstart (Mrs. Draper) came fourth, and
Mrs. Scamell's Tickell's Flycatcher and Lesser Niltavas fifth and sixth.
Davison's Ground Thrush (Sawyer) won the next class with Olive-
backed Thrushes (Everitt) second and a Blue-headed Rock Thrush
(Mrs. Scamell) third.
Mr. Whitmore won first and second in the class for starlings with
a pair of Amethyst and a Purple-headed. That for the grackles and
mynahs was headed by Mr. Sawyer's Rothschild's Grackle. It was of
interest to see Swainson's Toucan at the show. Mr. V. P. Labrum
won the class with a pair ; a Toco (Mrs. Scamell) being second
and a Knysna Touraco third.
Doves and quail were well represented, the winners being a pair of
Californian Quail shown by Mr. F. Turland, with a pair of Chinese
Painted Quail second. There was much of interest in the class for the
small " softbills " not previously classified, the first prize going to
a pair of Scarlet-backed Flower-peckers (Sawyer), second to a Copper-
smith Barbet (Franc-Alleu), and third to a small woodpecker that
was, I think, Picumnus innominatus innominatus, the Himalayan Speckled

Piculet. Others of note were two Tailor Birds, a White-bearded
Honey-eater, and a Ruby-throat.
The corresponding class for the next larger-sized was won by a
Turquoise Fairy Bluebird (Sawyer), a Streaked Spider Hunter (Clare)
being second, and one of the Scimitar-billed Babblers third. Golden-
fronted Woodpeckers and a Red and Yellow Barbet ( Trachyphonus
erythrocephalus ) were other noteworthy exhibits.
Last year's winner of the prize for the best bird in the show,
Mr. Sawyer's Cock of the Rock (R. peruviana sanguinolenta ) won the
next class ; also the prize for the best large " softbill ". Mr. Whitmore's
Brazilian Motmot came second and Mr. P. R. Passley's Golden-backed
Woodpecker third.
There were many entries in the classes for lovebirds and parrotlets,
and it was of interest to see so many Abyssinian among them.
Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Adams's Bourke Grass Parrakeets (first) and
Mr. G. Anderdon's Golden-crowned Conures (second) were of especial
interest in their small class. Mr. Whitmore's well-known Musschen-
broek's Lorikeet won its class, Mr. Anderdon's Philippine Hanging
Parrot coming second, and Mrs. Everitt's Vernal Hanging Parrots
third. Musk Lorikeets were also of interest in this class. A Red-
bellied Parrot ( Poicephalus rufiventris ) won the next class, a Yellow-
bellied Parrakeet coming second.
A Red Shining Parrakeet (Sawyer) easily won in the class for the
largest parrot-like birds ; also gaining the Duke of Bedford trophy.
It must be many years since this rare Fijian parrakeet was seen in
Europe.
It is a pity that exhibitors do not always send the birds they have
entered, but send a substitute which, of course, appears under the
original entry's name ; also that they sometimes do not name an
entry so that the owner's name only appears in the catalogue, as if
he was exhibiting himself, and they do not always trouble to get their
birds accurately identified. All these shortcomings tend to make the

A small collection of Himalayan birds has been received as a gift
from Mr. R. W. B. Izzard and Mr. G. Munro. They are a White-
capped Redstart, a Rufous-bellied Niltava, two Blue-winged Sivas,
two Silver-eared Mesias, two Hunting Cissas, and two Sikkim Jays.
The Sikkim. Jay (Garrulus glandarius interstinctiis) is sometimes called
the Red-crowned, but actually the head is of the same colour as the
body--a pinkish fawn--and the close relationship of this bird to our
native Jay is easy to see.
The Hunting Cissa is, of course, one of the green birds that turns
bluish in captivity, presumably a carotenoid deficiency causing a
dilution of the yellow pigment which, in conjunction with a layer of
blue reflecting cells, produces the natural delicate shade of green.
A Gentoo Penguin and a Siamese Fire-back Pheasant have been
received in exchange and a pair of Malabar Parrakeets (Psittacula
columboides ) presented by Mr. J. J. van den Brink. It is a long time
since this beautiful parrakeet was seen at Regent's Park.

Members had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Founder Member
Gerald lies, on a flying visit from Montreal.
The speaker for the evening, Howard Jarman, showed a fine selection
of Kodachrome slides to illustrate " Birds of the Bushland--Australian
Birds in colour At the conclusion the Chairman warmly congratu-
lated Howard Jarman on the interesting way in which the slides
were presented, a happy combination of birds and their natural
surroundings.
Howard Jarman has kindly written the following summary of his
talk :--
Australia has about 700 species of birds but only a very small
percentage of these, principally the cockatoos, colourful parrots and
finches are known to British aviculturists. But of the remainder there
are many of great interest, either because of their beauty, song, or
unique habits. Of the insectivores, the honeyeaters, of which there
are about sixty kinds, the Wood Swallows, and exquisite little Fairy
Wrens readily adapt themselves to aviary life, and many of them have
been bred, especially in South Australia.
Though the bright plumage of Australian birds is usually emphasized,
a great number are dull and obscure, such as the warblers, thornbills,
and several of the honeyeaters. There is a marked Malayan and
Indian influence on the Australian avifauna, particularly in the tropical
north. So we find a Drongo, Sunbird, white-eye (J^osterops ), Mistletoe
bird (flower-pecker), roller, bee-eater, and several wood-swallows
on the Australian list.
But several orders of Old World birds are absent, notably the wood-
peckers, vultures, auks, and true finches. So even if we are compensated
by having the mound-building megapodes and the bower-birds with
their ornamented playgrounds, it is a wonderful experience to be able
to come to Europe and view the collections, particularly as a total
prohibition on the importation of birds into Australia has been in
force for several years past with the 1 esult that some of the commonest
aviary birds in England are quite unknown in Australia.

G. W. Haywood, of Victoria, Australia, has had considerable
success in breeding the Neophema group. He has found that by putting
about a quarter of a pound of salt at the bottom of the nest-box or
log, under about three inches of a sandy soil-coarse sawdust mixture,
a helpful amount of moisture is retained and much of the danger of
" dead-in-shell " is obviated. It would be interesting to know whether
any breeders, especially of lovebirds, in this country have tried the
introduction of salt, and whether it proved beneficial.

From the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post , 6th February, 1959, New
York : "A strange tale of a frozen owl was told to-day in Boston by
Mr. William Drury, director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society's
Hathaway School of Conservation. The Society has asked anyone
</table>
<bodyText confidence="0.974589533333333" page_id="56317424"  page_num="55" year="" vol="">
who finds dead birds to bring them to it for stuffing.
The mounted specimens are used for its educational campaigns.
Recently an apparently dead owl was brought in. It had been found
lying on a snow-covered road.
It was put into a deep freeze with other bird corpses awaiting
attention. When Mr. Drury opened the deep freeze four days later
he found himself staring into a pair of bright owl eyes.
The owl was strutting about with a very well fed air, as well it
might. It had found plenty of food in the refrigerator. Mr. Drury
said the moral was that birds can live through the coldest weather if
only people will make efforts to feed them."
The Hathaway School is a corporate member of our Society, so
it is to be hoped that we may be informed of the species and
subsequent history of this owl.

GUIDE TO LOVEBIRDS AND PARROTLETS. By E. N. T. Vane.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998722555555555" page_id="56317425"  page_num="56" year="" vol="">
Cage Birds London, 1958. Price 12s. 6 d.
The most satisfying position a reviewer can be in is to be able to
commend the subject of review unreservedly, and this is certainly
the case with Mr. Vane's Guide to Lovebirds and Parrotlets. The
author has long and practical experience and, as he says in the preface,
he learned to keep birds in the hard way. There was no kindly mentor
to advise him, but he kept all the birds he could and read all the books
he could afford. Now Mr. Vane presents in a clear, concise, and readable
form the results of his own wide experience.
In the first chapter entitled " Past, Present and Future " he gives
much general information concerning Lovebirds, which term, as he
points out, is applied properly only to the genus Agapornis , and mentions
when the various species were first discovered and first imported.
The chapters which follow contain valuable information on accommoda-
tion, nest-boxes, planning a balanced diet, the breeding cycle, sexing,
and the sick bird. The author then gives detailed accounts of nine species
of Agapornis, and sub-species; each chapter is headed with a line drawing
of the birds perched over a map showing its distribution in the wild--
a happy idea which impresses this on the mind of the reader.
There are two coloured plates showing all nine species, with male
and female where they differ in appearance, and also the mutations,
blue Masked and lutino Nyasa. In addition there are a number of line
drawings illustrating aviaries, nest-boxes, and feeding bowls, and
photographic plates, including two of particular value which show
how to catch a Lovebird.
The book concludes with an account of the Parrotlets, those minia-
ture parrots of the New World of the genus Forpus which consists of
five species and twenty sub-species. The author points out that although
the Parrotlets of Central and South America are frequently known as
the Blue-wing Lovebirds, they are not, in fact, closely allied to the true
Lovebirds (. Agapornis ) of Africa, but their requirements for manage-
ment in captivity are very similar. This section is also illustrated with
a colour plate and map showing the distribution .
All the colour plates and drawings have been executed by the author,
who is to be congratulated on producing a first-class guide which
no aviculturist interested in these birds can afford to be without.

BEGINNERS. By Charles H. Trevisick, F.Z.S. Published by
Cage-Birds, London, 1958. Price 12s. 6af.
This book is, according to the author, an attempt " to guide the
novice step by step in very simple, everyday language " towards the
successful keeping of these birds in captivity : the language is
certainly simple--it is almost inarticulate. The title is unfortunate,
since the term " Fancy 55 Pheasants suggests to the lay mind some
curious bird bred by man and in some vague way connected with the
monstrosities of the poultry show bench, instead of a beautiful family
of birds existing quite naturally in the wild.
My chief complaint about this book is the plethora of mistakes in
the chapter devoted to " some exotic pheasants ", for example,
#S The Satyr Tragopan Tragopan satyra of which there are five species "--
it is, of course, itself a perfectly good species with no sub-species. Again,
" The Monals are a very big group with many species "--in fact they
are a small group of only three species. We are told of the Silver
Pheasant, " the male has a mantle of green double-laced feathers,"
this would indeed be unusual ; and that the Blue Eared Pheasant
" hails from Tibet ", whereas that country forms only a small part of
its range.
There are chapters on rearing and management, and on diseases.
It is difficult to understand why there are different sections on diseases,
one each for pheasants, jungle fowl, and peafowl, since all these birds
are members of the same family and prone to the same diseases. Thus
under diseases of pheasants no mention is made of aspergillosis,
salmonella, blackhead, or coccidiosis, although the last two are
mentioned under diseases of peafowl. Diarrhoea is, of course, not a
disease, but a symptom.
The chapter on rearing and management is basically sound, and
while more modern methods are now practised, the beginner should
not go far astray in following Mr. Trevisick's advice.
The illustrations, though sometimes inaccurate, are reasonably good
for a book of this type.

Referring to Dr. K. C. Searle's letter, 1958, p. 188, I can confirm that the male
and the female White-capped Redstart are alike in colour. I have collected and
sexed many specimens in Indo-China and also kept a number in captivity. One pair
at Cleres nested several times, although young were never reared. The female is
only slightly smaller than the male.
As to Mr. C. Everitt's remarks on the generic name of the Silver-eared Mesia,
I am responsible for making Mesia a synonym of Leiothrix. The two species argentauris
and lutea differ only slightly in size and in colours and it is inadvisable to recognize
two monotypic genera for two birds so similar also in habits and voice.

JAPANESE BLUE FLYCATCHERS

<bodyText confidence="0.986424243243244" page_id="56317427"  page_num="58" year="" vol="">
I was very interested in Dr. Searle's letter, and am grateful to him for preventing
me from spending my declining years trying to breed from two male Japanese Blue
Flycatchers !
Aviculture , Vol. 1, must have misled a great many people on this point, for on
pages 249-250 the differences in the plumage of the sexes of the Greater, the Red-
bellied, and the Lesser Niltava are clearly described ; after which follows the Japanese
Blue Flycatcher, of which it merely says : " is a beautiful blue bird with the sides of
the head, throat, and breast black, abdomen white. It is also found in China but
migrates to Indo-China and Malaya for the winter." So one can only suppose that
the writer himself was not aware of any difference in the sexes, otherwise--as in the
case of the Niltavas--he would surely have pointed it out.
We still have the two Flycatchers but are sad to note that, judging by Dr. Searle's
letter, there seems hardly the remotest chance of ever getting a mate for either of
them.
Curiously enough, only a couple of days ago I was looking through a folio of
original bird paintings by my uncle, the late John Whitehead, discoverer of the
Monkey-eating Eagle which was named Pithecophaga jefferyi, after my grandfather,
and among them was an excellent portrait of a Blue Flycatcher and his brown
mate--painted about seventy years ago.

THE R.S.P.C.A. ANIMAL HOSTEL AT LONDON AIRPORT
Mr. Tom Spence was perfectly right to express appreciation of the work done in
the R.S.P.C.A. Animal Hostel at London Airport.
Mr. Reid-Henry's statements suggest that he knows nothing of the excellent work
done there, nor how the birds waiting to be transhipped or collected are treated.
In any case, the number of birds of prey received there must be a very small fraction
of the thousands (some 300,000 during 1958) of others that are given attention.
This hostel has been operating for several years and, so far as I know, none of the
calamities envisaged by Mr. Reid-Henry has in fact taken place.
Whether birds are unpacked will, obviously, depend on the container they are in
and the length of their stay at the hostel. Most are not unpacked, but are given
food and water and kept in quiet, warm, and well-lighted rooms. The alternative
to such a place is a warehouse where there is likely to be a draught, poor lighting,
much noise, no fresh food and water, and where the birds are likely to be " suddenly
inspected " by every passer-by.

Having read Mr. Fletcher's letter in the last issue of the Avicultural Magazine
I would like to reply to the question qf inbreeding in waterfowl. I know the whole
question of inbreeding raises many doubts and queries and one in which a definite
law seems hard to fix. However, I can give some concrete cases.
At Woburn, the then Duke of Bedford, grandfather to the present Duke, bought
two wild-caught Red-breasted Geese, these birds after being kept eleven years proved
themselves to be a true pair, laying four eggs and rearing four young. If I remember
rightly in due course the goose was killed by a fox and the gander died. The Duchess
wrote me later saying that two of the young birds had started to lay and would it be
likely that the gander, their brother, would fertilize two females. Later she wrote
that a third bird had laid. All eggs produced young and after some years there were
thirty or forty in all. The Duchess very kindly gave me two pairs, from which only one
young was reared, a very poor bird at that, and the birds at Woburn eventually
produced no young. Also in the park at Woburn were a flock of Upland Geese,
these eventually numbered several hundred and when I was last there the Duke told
me that only one young had been reared that year, 1954, the Duke being the son
of the previous Duke I have already mentioned. At the same time a large number
of Amherst live there in a wild state, still producing healthy young from a very inbred
stock. In this country to-day many waterfowl in captivity are inbred, Falcated
Teal being possibly the most so. The pheasant family, rabbits, rats, and deer seem
to be able to inbreed without noticeable ill effects, but I am sure stamina must be lost.
With ducks, and Maned Geese are ducks, being related to the Carolina Duck, some
inbreeding seems to be all right but I should say not so with Geese. Mr. Fletcher
remarks on the fact that wild geese, such as Pink-feet, are in family groups during
the winter; that is so, but Grey Geese take three years to become adult and during
that period many casualties will have taken place. Most of the wild geese shot are
immature birds, and further during that period of three years the mix up in the flocks,
migration, etc., will be pretty sure to have split up the young birds. Back again to
ducks, I know from my own experience when I bought wild-caught Mandarin drakes
and paired the males to my own home-bred females it made a great improvement
in fertility, health, size, and colour. We find cases of albinos mostly in such birds as
sparrows and blackbirds, birds that probably move least, hence inbreeding with
lack of pigmentation and, probably, stamina.

Although most avian diets provide an adequate level of
nutrition for both adult and growing birds, the stimulating
effect upon metabolism of additional supplies of the B complex
group of vitamins is firmly established. The B complex is
widely present in nature, typical sources being liver,
germinating cereals, and yeast. Phillips Yeast Mixture
contains dried brewers' yeast of a vitamin-rich strain com-
pounded with a carefully balanced mixture of minerals and
trace elements. It is completely non-toxic and acceptable to

sJlUIS special softbill bird foods
The firm of P. Sluis was originally established at a small shop and factory
in Amsterdam, in 1823, by the great-grandfather of the present Piet Sluis,
and is believed to be the oldest established firm of Specialist Birdfood
Manufacturers in the world. They were certainly the originators of
the complete ready to use Special Birdfoods, which are obtainable in no
less than thirty different countries in the world to-day, and which,
although often imitated, have never yet been equalled.
64 Greenstuff 99 far birds
All birds need a daily allowance of " Greenstuff ", a new P. Sluis product
consisting of the choicest dehydrated Dutch vegetables and salads,
including carrots, lettuce, and spinach. " Greenstuff " contains the
essential vitamins of fresh green food, and should be given to both
softbills as well as hardbills. It should be mixed with their normal food.
" Greenstuff " saves you the trouble of hunting for fresh greenfood
for your birds--always difficult in winter.

(Gallus lafayettii Lesson)
By G. M. Henry (Constantine, Falmouth, Cornwall)
The genus Gallus comprises four species, of which the progenitor
of all domestic breeds, G. gallus , the Red Junglefowl, is by far the
best known. In its wild state this bird inhabits the northern and
eastern portion of India (used in its geographical, not political, sense),
and the neighbouring countries to the east of it, Burma, Siam, and
Malaya. The southern and western portions of the Indian Peninsula
are inhabited by the Grey Junglefowl, G. sonnerati. The Javan Green
Junglefowl, G. varius , is a very different-looking creature (especially
the male) from the other three, and would seem almost to deserve a
genus to itself.
The fourth member of the group is confined to Ceylon, where it is
widely distributed wherever jungle is sufficiently extensive to afford
it the protection and seclusion that it needs. It occurs at all eleva-
tions from sea-level to the highest hills--about 8,000 feet--but, owing
to the pressure of rapidly growing human population, involving
deforestation and cultivation, the Junglefowl is being crowded out of
vast areas where it was formerly common. There can be little question
that its survival is largely due to the extreme wariness that it develops
wherever it comes into contact with human kind ; in remote jungle
districts, where it had been unmolested by man, I have sometimes
found it to be little more nervous of observation than ordinary village
poultry. A very slight acquaintance with man and his ways, however,
suffices to render it cautious in the extreme. Forest of any kind, even
low scrub jungle, is its home, but it dislikes tall rain-forest with its
dense and lush undergrowth, and finds ideal conditions in the
comparatively low and open jungle of the dry zone. In more densely
wooded country it will be found on the outskirts rather than in the
depths. Although it never departs very far from cover, it likes to
emerge into open spaces, such as roadsides or deserted cultivation,

G. M. HENRY-THE CEYLON JUNGLEFOWL
especially in the early morning or after heavy rain. Like other forest-
haunting Phasianidae, it generally prefers running to cover rather
than flying, being difficult to put up on the wing unless surprised
when it has strayed too far from cover to reach it by a quick dash.
This statement, however, applies mainly to disturbance by humans ;
when alarmed by a dog or other carnivore its usual reaction is to fly
up into the nearest tree, there to peer at the intruder, cackling its
alarm for some time before flying off to safer quarters. When thus
excited, it carries the tail, which is usually trailed as shown in the
plate, much more erect, more after the manner of a domestic fowl.
One of the most characteristic sounds of the Ceylon jungles is the
crowing of the Jungle-cock. It is a joyous and musical sound,
generally likened to 44 George Joyce ". A better transliteration to my
ears is chiok , chaw choyik --uttered in a crisp and staccato manner--the
terminal ik being higher pitched than the rest. In uttering the crow,
the cock usually carries his head almost level with the body and
jerks the beak sharply up at each syllable--a very different style from
the bold stance of the farmyard Chanticleer ! Crowing may be heard
throughout the year, but is much more frequent during the breeding
season and is merely sporadic during the moult, which takes place
during August-October. Moulting, by the way, in the Ceylon
Junglefowl differs from that of both its Indian congeners in that there
is no 44 eclipse 55 phase of plumage intercalated into the moulting cycle.
The alarm-cackle of the Ceylon Jungle-hen is a high-pitched and
staccato kwikkuk , kwikkukkuk repeated at brief intervals. When about
to lay, she krarks in similar manner to a domestic hen but in a higher
key, and her cluck to her chicks is similarly high-pitched and metallic.
The food consists of seeds of many plants, grain, wild berries, leaves,
and buds, and numerous insects and small animals ; in fact, the bird
is completely omnivorous. The hen, in particular, is a most
industrious scratcher, leaving a trail of scratchings wherever she goes.
In the dry season, it is often possible to hear one scratching among
the rubbish of the forest floor a considerable distance off, and by
using the utmost caution, to stalk her. Hens, however, seem to be
much more wary than cocks, decamping at the slightest suspicion of
any unusual sound.
Nellu-flowering years are the Junglefowls' prosperous time ; this
genus of plants ( Strobilanthes --many species) forms the greater part of
the undergrowth in the upcountry forests above, say, 4,000 feet.
It flowers at intervals of several years, seeds profusely, and then dies.
The seed induces a periodical migration of Junglefowl, Spurfowl, and
other seed eaters into the mountain forests, where they fatten and
multiply greatly.
Roosting takes place in trees, usually fairly high, and perched on
thin outer branches, well sheltered by leafage. Nocturnal-hunting

palm civets, which can climb almost anything, are among the
Junglefowls' worst enemies, and the habit of selecting a type of
roosting site which prevents surprise attack by climbing marauders
has doubtless become fixed by natural selection. The same roost is
commonly used for a considerable period of time.
The cocks are very pugnacious during the breeding season,
challenging each other both by crowing and by clapping the wings
together over the back, from three to six claps. (The crow appears
to be an assertion of territorial claims, whereas wing-clapping is a
definite challenge to battle.) This smacking sound is easily imitated,
and often leads to the cock's undoing, as he may be lured by it within
easy gunshot from a distance of a hundred yards or more. While
approaching a " challenger ", however, he does not lose his native
caution and, in my experience, he nearly always approaches from a
different quarter than the expected one. Actual fights appear to be
infrequent, but when they do take place they are fierce and bloody.
I have occasionally met with a cock badly maimed and with its head
covered with gore ; while very old cocks may show scars of battle in
the shape of deeply slit comb and wattles. The spurs are fearsome
weapons, ij inches long and very sharp.
While sporadic breeding may go on for most of the year, the
principal season is in the first half. In the wild state, I believe that
monogamy prevails until incubation commences, and thereafter the
cock departs to make fresh conquests ; he is certainly not averse
from polygamy in captivity. His courting behaviour closely resembles
that of a domestic cock, except that it is conducted in a much more
ceremonious way. The display, which is repeated many times before
coition, consists in running closely round the hen, extending the wing
nearest to her to the ground and scraping its primaries with the foot.
At the same time, the purple rump-patch is raised on the opposite
side so as to make the most of its iridescent glories. Finally, the neck
hackles are expanded into a ruff.
The hen makes her nest--a mere scrape, with only such lining as
falls into it from the surrounding dead leaves, etc.--on the ground in
the shelter of a tree-trunk, rock, or fallen stump, concealed by herbage.
Many nests, however (possibly the majority), are made above ground
level, in such situations as the top of a dead stump, a heap of rubbish
caught up in tangled creepers, or even in the deserted nest of some
large bird. Two to four eggs comprise the normal clutch ; they are
pale buff, more or less finely peppered with dark specks, and measure
about 48 X 35 mm. The hen does not appear to announce the arrival
of her eggs by cackling and in fact, all her actions in connection with
her nursery are silent and furtive in the extreme. She approaches
her nest with the utmost caution, sits very close, and leaves her eggs
for the purposes of feeding, dusting, exercise, etc., only at intervals of

three or four days. She will suffer an enemy (human at any rate) to
approach to within a couple of yards, the while she trusts to her
perfectly camouflaged colour-scheme to avoid detection ; but when
compelled to leave, she runs or flutters silently away without any of
the fuss that a domestic hen would make.
Subject to confirmation, I believe, and have some evidence from
eggs hatched under domestic hens, that the incubation period is
considerably shorter than that of domestic fowls' eggs--no more than
eighteen or nineteen days. The chicks are very precocious, learning
to scratch for themselves almost as soon as they leave the nest. Their
flight feathers grow rapidly, and within a week they can fly like a quail.
At their mother's alarm-squawk, hatchlings vanish instantly like coins
from a juggler's hand, diving under fallen leaves or under herbage in
an amazing way. They are taken into trees for roosting when a few
days old, and they remain under the mother's care until they are
well grown.
The Ceylon Junglefowl in Captivity
This bird was for long regarded as very difficult to keep alive and
almost impossible to breed in captivity. Many attempts have been
made in the past to obtain hybrids between it and the domestic fowl
for the purpose of establishing whether or not such hybrids would
prove to be fertile, and, if they were, whether this species might have
had a part in the ancestry of any of the domestic breeds. These
attempts appear to have all come to nought, mainly owing to the
nervous and excitable nature of the bird. At a small zoo maintained
in the grounds of the Colombo Museum, the key to keeping Junglefowl
in health and breeding condition was found to lie in making their
aviaries as much as possible a microcosm of their jungle home, and
then leaving them to their own devices with an absolute minimum of
human interference. With the greater part of the aviary planted with
abundant shrubbery and grass-tussocks, and the floor (of natural
earth) covered with a thick mulch of garden sweepings, the birds
settled down quickly, tamed themselves, and lost their reluctance for
human observation. Under these conditions they bred and multiplied
at a great rate.
Hybridization
In 1941-43 I obtained several broods of hybrids between a Jungle-
cock and a domestic hen of mongrel-type with traces of Malay game
blood. She was a light-brown bird, quite evenly marked, and such
pattern as she possessed conformed to that of the Gallus gallus type.
She was put into the Junglefowls' aviary with a full-plumaged cock
who promptly courted her assiduously ; and after fertilization, she
was removed to my home where she laid her eggs and incubated them.

G. M. HENRY-THE CEYLON JUNGLEFOWL 65
The chicks, although slightly larger than pure-bred Junglefowl chicks,
resembled them closely in colour and pattern, and some of the females
among them, as they grew up, developed a colour scheme almost
identical with that of the wild hen, but with coarser markings.
Unfortunately, of the first brood raised, only one cock ( &amp;lt;c Robinson ")
reached full maturity, the remainder succumbing to fowl-pest and
the attacks of palm civets. With the second brood better success was
achieved, a cock (" Crusoe ") and three hens being reared to full
maturity. However, of this brood, none of the hens partook so fully of
the Jungle-hen appearance as those of the first brood, in spite of the
fact that their parentage on both sides was identical (this I was most
careful to ensure). Neither of the cocks resembled the Jungle-cock in
colour ; " Robinson 55 was a rich golden-maroon in general colour,
with the sickle and other tail-feathers greenish-black, strongly glossed
with amethystine ; he grew a small comb of somewhat indefinite
colour but showing nothing of the brilliant yellow centre so charac-
teristic of the wild cock. " Crusoe " was of a bright golden-brown, with
tail similar to " Robinson's " but his comb was a mere rudiment.
Neither of them showed the dark median streaks to the hackles present
in the Jungle-cock.
In behaviour, these hybrids showed an interesting intermediate
nature between the two parental species. They had the run of a large
compound in Colombo, and no other fowls were kept. The hens were as
nervous and excitable as Jungle-hens, had a similar high-pitched cackle,
and all could fly perfectly. " Robinson " and " Crusoe " became
terrific fighters, and sometimes had to be segregated from each other
for some time, to save their lives. Their crowing was an extraordinary
sound, utterly unlike the crow of either Gallus lafayettii or G. gallus ,
and they indulged in it very freely, especially in the wee sma' hours
of the night. All the hybrids roosted, singly, among foliage of high
branches of trees in the garden.
On reaching maturity, mating took place between the cocks and
hens, and the latter nested in various situations in the garden, laying
three or four eggs. One selected a fern-pot hanging from the verandah
eaves. Several broods of chicks were hatched, but none of this
generation survived for more than a day or two. The hatchlings,
unlike those of the first generation, were very patchily marked, and
several of them were born blind. Their mothers' frantic behaviour
made their management impossible.
Like Jungle-hens, the hybrids sat very close, leaving their nests only
at intervals of three or four days, but unlike them, when they did
leave, they would dash off on the wing, cackling excitedly. I believe
this habit possesses biological significance for species-survival, in that
it diverts attention of enemies from the uncovered eggs to the hen
(who can take care of herself). It would be interesting to learn what

Las Islas Encantadas --the Enchanted Isles, Insulae de los Galopegos --
the Tortoise Islands, El Archipielago de Colon , Galapagos : World's End,
are the home of the Galapagos Dove JVesopelia galapagoensis (Gould).
The Galapagos Islands are a volcanic group lying on the Equator,
extending ij degrees on either side of it, and about 600 miles west
of the Republic of Ecuador, to which they belong. There are six
principal islands, nine smaller, and many islets, scarcely deserving
to be distinguished from mere rocks. The largest island, Albemarle,
is 60 miles in length and about 15 miles broad, the highest of the five
dormant volcanoes rising 5,600 feet above sea level. Fewer than 2,000
people live on the islands.
Captain William Dampier (1729), the buccaneer, visited the
islands in 1684, and says : " There are great plenty of Turtle-Doves
so tame, that a Man may kill 5 or 6 dozen in a Forenoon with a stick.
They are somewhat less than a Pigeon, and are very good Meat, and
commonly fat."
Captain Ambrose Cowley (1729), another buccaneer, visited the
islands about the same time, and writes : " Here are also abundance
of Fowls, viz. Flemingoes and Turtle Doves ; the latter whereof were
so tame, that they would often alight upon our Hats and Arms, so as
that we could take them alive, they not fearing Man, until such time
as some of our Company did fire at them, whereby they were render'd
more shy."
The next visitor to write of the tameness of these doves was Captain
(later Admiral) David Porter (1822) in 1813 : " Doves peculiar to
these islands, of a small size, and beautiful plumage, were very
numerous, and afforded great amusement to the younger part of the
crew in killing them with sticks and stones, which was nowise difficult,
as they were very tame."
On its famous voyage round the world during the years 1832 to
1836, H.M.S. Beagle , under the command of Captain Fitzroy, R.N.,
arrived at the Galapagos Islands on 17th September, 1835. The
naturalist to the expedition was Charles Darwin. During a stay of
five weeks he visited four islands, made his very remarkable observa-
tions and left on 20th October.

Darwin (1841) writes : " This dove is one of the most abundant
birds in the Archipelago. It frequents the dry rocky soil of the low
country, and often feeds in the same flock with the several species of
Geospiza. It is exceedingly tame, and may be killed in numbers.
Formerly it appears to have been much tamer than at present.
... It is surprising that the change has not been greater ;--for these
islands during the last hundred and fifty years, have been frequented by
buccaneers and whalers ; and the sailors, wandering through the woods
in search of tortoises, take delight in knocking down the little birds."
Darwin (1839) also says : " These birds, although much persecuted,
do not become wild in a short time : in Charles Island, which had
then been colonized about six years, I saw a boy sitting by a well
with a switch in his hand, with which he killed the doves and finches
as they came to drink. He had already procured a little heap of them
for his dinner ; and he said he had constantly been in the habit of
waiting there for the same purpose. We must conclude that the birds,
not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous animal than
the tortoise, or the amblyrhynchus, disregard us, in the same manner
as magpies in England do the cows and horses grazing in the fields."
John Gould (1841) described and depicted Darwin's specimens, and
named this species Z ena ^ a Galapagoensis. But in 1872 the Swedish
Professor Carl J. Sundevall (1873) placed it in a separate genus
Nesopelia. Its distinctness from Z ena ^ a appears to be slight, but the
tail is proportionally shorter and less graduated, and is composed of
twelve instead of fourteen rectrices.
Gould is the recognized author but prior to his description
Dr. Neboux (1840), Surgeon-Major of the frigate Venus , had described
some of the new birds collected during the voyage round the world
of that vessel in 1836-39. He named this dove Colomhi-Galline des
Gallapagos , without, however, assigning any scientific name (and
see Prevost and Des Murs (1855)).
Salvadori (1893) describes this dove : " Adult male. Forehead
dark vinous, changing into brown-olive on the crown, occiput, nape,
mantle, lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts ; throat pale
rufous, changing into deep vinous on the breast ; abdomen rusty
vinous ; under tail-coverts grey, more or less with a rusty tinge ;
ear-coverts silvery grey, bordered above and below with a black line ;
feathers of the cheeks vinous, edged with black ; sides of the neck
with golden and amethyst reflections ; scapulars and upper wing-
coverts brown, each with two black spots, one on each web, the
central part of the feathers often whitish ; outer upper wing-coverts
whitish on the outer web ; primary-coverts and quills blackish, the
latter with paler tips and narrow light edges ; under surface of the
quills greyish ; tail greyish brown, with a black subterminal band,
leaving a broadish apical band : c iris dark brown ; feet pink ;

eyelids pale blue 5 {Dr. Habel ) ; bill black. Total length about
8*5 inches, wing 5-25, tail 2*7, bill 0*65, tarsus 0*9."
There are some slight variations in plumage and measurements
noticeable between specimens from the various islands. Robert
Ridgway (1897) gives a full description with measurements, and
Gifford (19130) gives a table of measurements for 174 specimens.
The female differs from the male in its " much smaller size, duller
upper surface, and more whitish wing-coverts, while the sides of the
neck are often as glossy as in the male. Immature birds are below
brownish, with whitish fringes to the feathers, the sides of the neck
are not glossy, and the lesser upper wing-coverts have rufous edges
Rothschild and Hartert (1899).
The egg is pure white in colour and elliptical-oval in shape. E. W.
Gifford (1913) gives the following measurements for four eggs :
Narborough Island, 26*4 X 20*4 mm. ; Wenman Island, 27*0 X
20*2 mm., and 26-0 X 19-7 mm., 26-3 X 19-6 mm. (same nest).
Nesopelia galapagoensis (Gould) is found on all the principal islands
of the Archipelago. It is, however, represented by a distinctive race
on the two most northerly islands, Culpepper and Wenman. This
subspecies has been described and named JV. g. exsul by Rothschild
and Hartert (1899). It differs only from the nominate race in being
considerably larger, having a larger body, longer wings, and a longer
and heavier bill.
Darwin's exploration was the forerunner of numerous scientific
expeditions. The majority of these, however, were more interested in
surveying or collecting the Giant Land Tortoises and Marine
Iguanas than in studying the life history of a small dove, although
the various reports of the majority do give some passing reference to
it and its very remarkable tameness.
Dr. A. Habel (1876) visited the islands in 1868, and says :
" Having been accustomed to find the skins of Central-American
Doves very tender and difficult to remove, I was surprised at the
toughness of the skin of this species, it being even stronger than the
rest of the land-birds of these islands.
For some years parties have visited these islands to collect the
orchilla {Rocella tinctoria), a kind of moss growing on the bushes,
trees, and even rocks on the windward side of the islands. This Dove
being considered by these men a delicate morsel, is caught by them
in numbers. It is therefore neither so abundant nor so tame as in
former years ; nevertheless many were knocked down with switches
every morning by our men, as many as three dozen sometimes falling
to one man before breakfast, all of which he would devour at one
meal ! "
So far this has been a saga of persecution and slaughter, and this
sorry narrative of necessity continues.

1905-1906, as ornithologist. And so, at last, we are given a picture
of the life of this dove.
It appears that the breeding season, taken as a whole throughout
the Archipelago, extends over seven months, from March to September
inclusive.
The nests are usually in slight hollows in little cavities in the rocks,
sheltered from the weather by overhanging ledges or shelves, and are
roughly lined with fern-stems and pieces of grass. But on Wenman
Island (one of the two islands occupied by the larger exsul) " The
nests were slight depressions in the ground, lined with grass and
protected by the broad leaves of cactus (Opuntia Helleri), the plants
growing very close to the ground. . . . When flushed, the owners of
the nests fluttered away as though wounded 55 .
Gifford goes on to say : " They were frequently seen during the
day, sitting in the trees and bushes and in the tree cactuses (Opuntia),
and once or twice, during rains, taking shelter beneath overhanging
rocks. During a brief interval of sunshine one day, on Gardner-near-
Hood, I observed a flock of a dozen or more lying on their sides and
stretching one wing up to sun themselves--a common habit among
doves.
The daily flights of this bird seemed to take place chiefly in the
mornings and evenings, and were evidently made to and from water
and roosting-places. Single birds and straggling flocks were seen.
Perhaps the largest flight was noted at James Bay, James Island,
where, on the evenings of August 6 and 7, scores flew by towards
the black lava south of the bay. They flew along the beach and over
the water at an elevation of twenty or thirty feet, some much higher,
coming from the direction of the lofty promontory at the north end of
the bay. Occasionally doves were seen flying from Hood Island to the
neighbouring Gardner, and vice versa ; and on July 25 two were
encountered at sea flying from Daphne towards Indefatigable.
On the ground, the gait of the Galapagos Dove was similar to that
of the Mourning Dove. Its flight, however, was neither as swift nor
as graceful. In alighting, a whistling sound was often produced,
apparently with the wings.
Their chief food was seeds and occasional pieces of green grass.
Once some were seen eating cactus pulp from a fallen tree, and on
another occasion several were seen feeding on the ocean-beach among
the mangroves.
When killed, considerable water sometimes escaped from their
mouths, as was also the case with Passerine Doves (Chamaepelia
passerina) killed on Socorro, Revilla Gigedo Islands. Their drinking
places were found to be rather varied. In some instances they were

noted drinking from a tank epiphyte (Tillandsia insularis ) which grew
in the transition and forested moist regions, and which sometimes
contained as much as a pint of water. On Bindloe Island they
quenched their thirst with the water that condensed about the steam-
holes in the craters. On other islands they resorted to springs, ponds,
and water-holes, although some of the last at times contained rather
salty water."
No account appears to be complete without mention of numbers
killed, and this applies even to the present. Gifford says : " On
Charles Island they were easy of approach, in spite of the fact that
that island has been much frequented by man. From our experience,
it would seem that this bird is rather slow in recognizing its enemies.
In fact, they were so unsophisticated that we noosed many, and caught
many in hand-nets. One day on Hood Island, Mr. King and I
noosed twenty-one. The nooses were of thread, and were fastened to
the ends of sticks six or eight feet long. The birds were followed about
until an opportune moment arrived, when the noose was slipped over
the head of one. We found we were more successful when barefoot
than when wearing shoes, as the noise caused by the contact of shoes
with rocks startled the birds. The males proved warier than their
mates. On northwestern Indefatigable we killed a great many
doves for food with sticks and stones."
Joseph R. Slevin (1931) also accompanied this Expedition, as
herpetologist. His diary contains a dozen or more references to this
dove, but his interest was purely culinary. For instance, under the
date 30th November, 1905, we read : " Thanksgiving Day ! All
hands turned out at 6.00 a.m. for 6.30 breakfast, after which we
all went ashore to hunt doves for our Thanksgiving dinner. By
nine o'clock we mustered at the landing place with 96 doves between
us. We plucked and cleaned them on the beach, bringing them on
board for the cook, who gave the dishpan an extra good cleaning
and used it to bake a dove pie in. Dove and cocoanut pie dinner
at 2.00 p.m." Slevin relates that on one day alone about 250 were
killed !
The Academy's series of skins of this species numbers 226, ninety-
three of which are adult males and eighty-one adult females.
In 1923 the Harrison Williams-New York Zoological Society
Galapagos Expedition, with William Beebe as Director of Scientific
Work, made a brief visit to the islands.
Beebe (1924) gives an account of his encounter with this dove.
It is so charming it is well worth recounting in full ; and be it noted,
there is no mention of any killing !
" I climbed slowly up the bouldered cliffs to a wonderful look-out,
the entrance to an ideal pirate's cave, with all the great expanse of
Darwin Bay spread out before me. I lay flat on a gently sloping,

shadowed slab of lava and watched another hour of Tower's life.
In the distance was the Noma , with her wireless cross-pieces covered
with birds, a booby on each mast top and a mist of frigates, dense as
gnats, revolving slowly overhead.
A tide pool near the base of my cliff was half emptied and along
its shrinking rim stalked immature yellow-crowned night herons
and lava gulls, eagerly snatching at stranding fish.
A pair of little blue-eyed doves came trotting along and pattered
over my shoes before they sensed me as a living creature. With a
crackle of wings they were off, but as if drawn, magnet-wise, they
swung around to a neighbouring rock and, with bobbing heads, put
their whole souls into a scrutiny of me. I sat up and the world-old
tragedy of fear began. I did not understand. This was Galapagos,
where fear had not entered and yet here the female was using all her
wiles to tempt me away. She threw herself prone upon her breast
and flapped helplessly, moving along by spasmodic jerks of both feet
at once. Her head swayed from side to side, her beak opened as if
in dying gasps, and she uttered low, undovelike sounds, wow ! wow !
almost under her breath. Ceasing for a moment, she joined her mate
and both crept about like mice, over and under the jagged lava.
I watched for the focus of their efforts, and finally, six feet away I
lifted a small piece of clinker. There was the home of the Galapagos
dove, a few wisps of grass stems, a twig or two, forming a vague mat
on which squatted a pair of squabs, fat and scantily downed in white.
Although dazed by the flood of light which devastated the darkness
of their little lava cave, they showed no fear : this was only the
latest incident in the unknown out-of-door life which was ahead of
them. The mother dove fairly brushed against my hand in her appeal
for her precious twins, so I lowered the lava slab and went back to
my couch. She took this as good faith, and no longer played her
little deception, but gave me one last glance and slipped down upon
her babies.
During the first day I saw a half dozen of these doves here and
there, but not until we began to search carefully did I realize how
numerous they were. We found eight nests within a hundred yards of
our landing beach, four with eggs and four with young birds."
Beebe gives two photographs by John Tee-Van, a female dove on
the lookout above her nest, and a nest with the half-grown squabs.
These are probably the first published of this species. Beebe (1926)
again visited the islands in 1925.
Gifford, Beebe, and others refer to the distraction display of this
dove. Harry S. Swarth (1935) discusses this injury-feigning, and says :
" The Dove is using a method of protection that has been implanted
among her reactions for ages past, and it may be noted that this
utterly useless but quite characteristic habit has survived through a

It is highly probable that the Galapagos Dove was first bred in
captivity in the United States, so we will commence the review on
that side of the Atlantic.
The 1923 Harrison Williams Galapagos Expedition collected two
or three doves for the New York Zoological Park. The actual number
is not known to the present compiler, nor is any of their later
history, but it is quite possible they were the first to be kept
alive in America.
Professor E. W. Gifford (1931), who has already described its habits
in the wild state, writes : " Mr. Albert E. Colburn of Los Angeles is !
the possessor of a large collection of living Galapagos Doves. The
nucleus of this collection comprised birds brought by him from the
islands after a fishing trip. From him I obtained a pair for my aviary
in the early part of 1930. When I visited Mr. Colburn's aviary in
December, 1929, there were several pairs with eggs and young.
He seemed to be having marked success in propagating the species. 55
It would seem then that to Mr. Colburn goes the honour of breeding
this dove for the first time, presumably in 1928 or 1929, in captivity
anywhere.
Professor Gifford presents some notes on the breeding activities of
his own pair. As this is the most complete account published to date
it is now reproduced in full :--
" At the time of arrival (March 4, 1930) the female appeared to
be subadult. The male seemed fully adult and was a strapping big
fellow compared with the diminutive hen. She has not lost her
waddling gait nor the habit of carrying her wing tips below her tail.
Her daughter now has the same traits.
In the spring after several weeks in my possession, the couple
nested following perhaps a fortnight of courtship. The nest was made
in [a] fiber bowl set in a canned goods box. Dry grass stems were
used for nesting material and were all brought to the site by the cock.
He was a rapid worker and in a day had assembled the materials.
Two eggs were laid. These hatched in June.
Incubation lasted thirteen or fourteen days. At the age of eight or
nine days the squabs, which were only partially feathered, were
deserted by their parents. The cause of this was apparently the
ardor of the cock for a new nest. Mrs. Gifford took the fledglings
into the house and for a month fed them by mouth. One squab
remained tame and responsive to her presence ; the other became
wild and intractable as soon as it could feed itself. The latter is the
daughter referred to above. The former, unhappily, died of fright
</bodyText>

A. A. PRESTWIGH-GALAPAGOS DOVE IN FREEDOM AND CAPTIVITY 73
when I attempted to remove him by hand from a small cage in which
I had transported them to the aviary.
Meanwhile the parents hatched two more squabs which they
likewise deserted. These were taken indoors, but efforts to rear them
proved unavailing. Somewhat discouraged at this lack of success,
we decided to leave the third pair of squabs to the tender mercies of
their parents. The mother apparently decided it was time she reared
some of her own children. Then a strange thing happened. The
father disappeared from view in the aviary. Investigation showed him
hiding in the corner of a shelter. Observation then revealed that
every time he came in sight of his wife she pursued him savagely.
Truly, he was henpecked. Under this treatment he lost his enthu-
siasm for a new nest and in a few days was noted performing his
parental duties in the feeding of the squabs. These have now grown
to maturity, a condition revealed by the pale blue naked skin around
the eyes.
In October the fourth pair of squabs was hatched and after a few
days were allowed to die. In November the fifth clutch of eggs were
laid, but was deserted. Now, in December, another nest is being
constructed. The results will doubtless be nil so far as squabs are
concerned because of the handicap of cold weather. On the whole
the results are not pleasing--eight squabs hatched, four reared, three
living.
For aviaries Galapagos Doves are to be highly recommended. They
are charmingly tame and inquisitive, and continually active. Dig
with a spade or trowel and you will find them under your feet searching
for tidbits. If you do not dig for them they are continually at it
themselves, indefatigably turning with their beaks loose earth, leaves
and rubbish.
In addition to the chicken feed mixture called # growing scratch 5
I supply them with screenings which contain wild seeds, millet and
small grains of hemp.
In displaying to the hen the cock makes his scarcely audible coo
with his head down and his tail slightly spread. He struts in a very
erect position when approaching close to her.
In defense of his nest the cock will attack Pigeons several times his
size that come into his vicinity, even routing such pugnacious birds
as the Triangular-spotted Pigeon (Columbia guinea). The female, too,
is almost equally courageous. On the other hand, the species is not
of a bullying nature. 35
Professor Carl Naether (1958) says : " The late Karl Koch, ardent
aviculturist of the San Diego Zoo, brought a fairly large number of
these quaint-looking little ground doves from the Galapagos Islands
to this country some years ago. . . . ?J These San Diego Zoo doves
apparently bred well, because G. H. Corsan (1932), describing a

visit of the Southern Californian aviculturists, says : "A whole pen
full of the almost extinct Galapagos Doves surprised us all. Yes, and
Mr. Ring never lost a bird, they bred so well." Why " almost extinct " ?
Mrs. A. H. Bryan, Canal Zone, Isthmus of Panama, was also
breeding them about this time. Dr. William Beebe (1933) says he
saw " Galapagos doves and callistes nesting in any place they could
find".
Over a very long period Professor Naether has been very successful
with a great variety of doves and pigeons. The Galapagos Dove does
not, however, appear to have done well with him. In 1935 he writes :
" Of the fifteen varieties of foreign Doves in my aviaries, the
Galapagos are by all odds the ' fightiest '. Kept at first with a pair
of Australian Crested Doves, it was but a very short time before the
Galapagos fought them so continually that I had to separate the two
pairs. While the two pairs were together the Galapagos had the
following breeding record :--
Laid first time on 20th March ; deserted 23rd March.
Laid second time 1st April ; deserted 8th April.
Laid third time 10th May ; deserted 15th May.
Laid fourth time 20th May ; deserted 23rd May.
Laid fifth time 9th June ; deserted 13th June.
When the Galapagos were separated from the Australian Crested
Doves, they laid for the sixth time on 26th June, only to desert the
eggs on 4th July. During all these ' sittings 5 they used but two
nesting places, both largely hidden from view. On nth July the
seventh sitting of eggs was deposited, and on 25th July two young
hatched. This is the first time that this pair of Doves has had young.
At this writing the female is frequently off the nest to fight the male
unmercifully, so that I had to remove him temporarily from the
aviary. The moment she found that the male was gone she returned
to her as yet tiny youngsters." The young on this occasion do not
appear to have been reared, for Professor Naether (1958) says :
" Though I have kept pairs of these blocky little busy-bodies on several
occasions, they made no serious attempt to nest." He also says :
" But not being at all ready breeders in confinement, they have again
become so scarce that further importations will be needed to replenish
fanciers 5 stocks. 55 I understand Professor Naether now has another
pair. It is to be hoped they will prove more successful than his
previous pairs.
Further importations will not be necessary if J. W. Steinbeck, of
Concord, continues to breed on his present scale. He must surely
have found the secret of success with this species for, during 1958,
he says : "I have raised over seventy-five young birds from the
flock my friend brought back last winter 55 (1958).

Four examples were presented to the Zoological Society of London*
on nth July, 1893, by Captain Hedworth Lambton, R.N. (1896).
A few days before Christmas, 1932, Lord Moyne returned from a
yachting voyage during which he visited the Galapagos Islands. He
brought back four Marine Lizards, one Flightless Cormorant
(.Nannopterum harrisi), and five Galapagos Doves, all of which he
presented to the Zoological Society of London (Seth-Smith, 1933).
The doves were put in the Western Aviary and during August, 1933,
two young ones were reared (#00 Report). They do not appear to
have nested successfully again, as there is no further mention of them.
On 12th October, 1937, a pair of doves arrived at Leckford from
Cleres. The first young one was hatched on 28th March, 1938, and
from then on they bred freely. By the autumn, 1939, there were
about a dozen there and a number of home-bred birds had by then
been sold (F. T. Jones, in litt. 17th November, 1958). Miss E. F.
Chawner (1938, 1939) says the original pair first nested on the ground,
in a little depression in a corner of one of the pheasant shelters ; but
the succeeding nests were all fairly high up. By the end of 1938 they
had increased to seven.
About the same time Herbert Whitley was also breeding them at
Paignton, and there were some at Foxwarren Park in 1938.
Presumably, like so many other birds, they all died out during the war.
We have recently received three pairs from J. W. Steinbeck and so are
hoping to re-establish this species in England.
France
Jean Delacour bred this Dove freely at Cleres in 1934, 1935, and 1936.
Germany
Dr. J. Nicolai, Max-Planck-Institut, Seewiesen, has kindly
supplied the photograph of an adult male which forms the subject
of the accompanying plate.
Dr. Nicolai has had considerable success in breeding the Galapagos-
taube, and says {in litt. 13th February, 1959) : " My Galapagos
Doves were brought over in November, 1957, by my colleague Dr. I.
Eibl-Eibesfeld who had joined an expedition to the Galapagos Islands
sponsored by the unesco. I believe Mr. Steinbeck's Doves were
brought by Dr. Bowman, a member of the same expedition. When
M. Jean Delacour visited our Laboratory he told me that he, too,
had acquired a pair from Dr. Bowman.
My two pairs together reared nine young during 1958. Those
bred during the winter (the first nest was in January) were liable to
rhachitis, which could be counteracted by one or two drops of cod-liver

oil daily. In contrast, young reared in the summer developed into
fine, healthy birds.
Incubation lasts 13 days, and the young leave the nest when
17 days old. They are then able to fly but normally run on the ground.
They return to the nest to roost for some days further. Only two of
the nine young reared were males. 55

December, 1958, a pair of Empress of Germany's Birds of Paradise
mated. With the Empress of Germany, as is common with many
Birds of Paradise, the male plays no part in the building of the nest,
feeding the female, or rearing the chicks. I am rather suspicious that
in the early stages after hatching the male would actually do harm
to the young ; he was therefore run off into another aviary. The
female built a simple nest on the ground, on a mound about 6 inches
higher than the surrounding ground, and in a clump of miniature
bamboo. This particular female in her several efforts at breeding
had laid two eggs. On this occasion again two eggs were produced.
She sat very carefully and eventually two young were hatched. In
all her previous attempts she went to nest earlier and the youngsters
were hatched at a time when there was very little insect life available.
However, in November and December there is an abundance of
insect life, and I was able, with the assistance of quite a number of
enthusiastic youngsters, to collect sufficient to add to their fruit, con-
sisting of paw-paw, ripe apple and banana, currants, and yolk of egg.
The hen appeared to be doing a splendid job, but as the eggs were
completely in the open and on the ground, and at that time of the
year we have a number of thunderstorms, some quite heavy, that
could have been disastrous to the little family. I therefore covered
the whole of the aviary with a plastic substance reinforced with fine
flywire, known here as 44 Windowlite ", fastened securely in position.
As there were a number of paw-paws growing in the enclosure, the
44 Windowlite " acted as though the paw-paw trees were in a glass
house, aiding the fruit to ripen and supplying fresh fruit growing in
their own enclosure ; the birds appreciated this very much.
On the evening that the covering of the aviary was completed we
had a very heavy storm, with nearly 3 inches of rain, and I was, of
course, very pleased that I had the covering ready for such an event.
The hen carried on with the feeding of the two youngsters until they
were fully fledged. The young birds were flying whilst they were still
quite small, and completed their growing up amongst the tree branches
in their enclosure. They made very little attempt to feed themselves
until they were almost the size of their mother.
I am particularly happy with this breeding performance, as most
nests observed in the wild in New Guinea have but one egg, whereas
this female always lays two. The youngsters are now fully grown and

independent of the hen ; one is larger than the other, and from other
appearances I feel sure they are a true pair. It will be interesting to
watch these birds grow to maturity. The aviary is in full view of the
public, hundreds and on some days several thousands of people passing
close by without disturbing the hen whilst she was sitting and later
whilst attending to the young. They were in the charge of one of our
keepers, Dudley Gannon, who gave them great care and attention
until they were safely reared.
Lutino Indian Ring-necked Parrakeet .--Last year's breeding was dis-
appointing. I only hatched and reared twenty-two of these birds.
The special type of aviaries that I have are excellent to the point
when the youngsters leave the nest. Of ten pairs that laid eggs last
season, none attempted to feed the youngsters after they left the nest.
The final feeding had to be done by hand with the aid of a special
syringe. It usually took about two weeks before the youngsters were
taking food freely by themselves. We now have approximately 100
lutinos. In setting these birds up to breed I always put together
a lutino male and female ; as a result all the young are lutinos.
African Grey Parrot .--With these birds the male of my one very good
pair was accidentally killed after having raised about twelve young.
This season I have tried out another male and on peeping into the
nest this morning it was observed that the female was sitting on eggs.
We must now have patience and wait and see if the eggs are fertile.
With another pair, the female had laid a number of eggs, always
infertile. The male had been changed from time to time, and
vitamin E given. I am very pleased to say that she now has one
young, three parts grown. The young Grey Parrots that I have
bred over the years are now becoming interested in housekeeping,
and some look as if they will go to nest this coming season. Some
have been paired up, and I am looking forward with interest to what
will happen with our own bred youngsters. I have had many letters
from our members asking for particulars on how to breed African Grey
Parrots. I should say the best type of bird to breed from is one that
is not finger tame, but is tame enough not to resent human intrusion.
The birds breed in a log placed at an angle in the aviary, are suitably
fed, watered and cleaned, and left as quiet as possible. I use partly
decomposed wood shavings about 2 inches deep in the lower end of
the log, which is about 3 ft. 6 in. long. On account of being in a
sloping position, the end farthest away from the opening is where the
decomposed shavings are placed. I have found this method quite
satisfactory.
Macaws .--Last year I reared a number of Blue and Yellow and Red
and Yellow Macaws. This season just past I have done equally well.
I am sure there would have been a great deal more successful breeding
had it not been for a very strange year. The birds came on to lay

and before their incubation was completed, started to moult. In many
cases the eggs were left and lost.
Golden-shouldered Parrakeet. --This very rare and beautiful bird is now
breeding very freely in my aviaries. It is much more difficult to
succeed with them than with any other bird I have. Their habitat,
which was once quite extensive, has now been reduced to a small area
of only a few miles. I was fortunate to get a permit to take a few birds,
and with them I have now built up a collection of about forty. The
great difficulty in breeding these birds is that they go to nest in May
in their natural habitat where it is warm and hot at that time of the
year. In Sydney in the southern part of Australia it is quite cold
in May. I have observed that the female does not cover the youngsters
and provide them with warmth from her own body, but sits alongside
the little ball of fluff, which may be four, five or six youngsters. On
very cold nights we had some losses, but fortunately the season just
past was a warm winter and all the young came through successfully.
New arrangements are under way for the coming season.
Paradise Parrakeet .--Several years ago I was wrestling with the prob-
lem of breeding a synthetic Paradise Parrakeet. I now have three
pairs of birds that appear to have the exact appearance of the Paradise
Parrakeet. I have shown them to a good many people here who
know birds, and not one was able to identify them as being anything
but the true natural birds. The next problem will be : are these
birds fertile ? I have bred a number of hybrids between the Hooded
and Golden-shouldered Parrakeets. These quite readily produce
young ; the young in turn are also fertile. I now have three genera-
tions of these fine birds. I am hoping that the same will apply to my
latest synthetic Paradise Parrakeets.
Cloncurry Parrakeet. --This rare and very beautiful pastel-coloured
bird I have tried to breed for a number of years without success.
I know now, of course, that I was unfortunate enough to get all males,
and I was not sure of the sexing. Year after year I procured an
occasional new bird, until I obtained one slightly smaller, the colour
of which was more sombre than the birds I had ; I realized that this
meant a sex difference. She mated with one of my older birds and
produced four young. Last year she produced nine young in two
clutches. The previous two years she had four each year. A second
pair has now produced two clutches, each of two birds.
Roseate Cockatoo. --In 1958 for the first time I was able to procure
three albinos. Albinos are magnificent birds with pure white backs,
tails, and wings with a more brilliant red breast. One was mated
to an ordinary male and the other pair was put up together. Each
pair produced eggs but made no attempt to sit.
Last year I also bred three pairs of Red-vented Parrots from South
America and now have a fine little flock of these beautiful birds.

Canary-winged Parrakeets and Golden-crowned hybrid Cactus Conures
went to nest and successfully hatched youngsters.
Glossy Black Cockatoos. --These were again successfully bred. Two
of the earlier youngsters have now reached maturity and are now
interested in one another and the nest, and I am hoping that they
will go to nest very soon. My keeper had a peep into the original
nest of the parent birds and for the first time we saw two eggs, which
is exceptional as we have never before seen more than one. Their food
is so highly specialized and the work of the parents in feeding the
youngsters is so constant that I very much doubt their ability to rear
two young. I have no intention of interfering, and will on my part
give them an abundance of food and all the encouragement I can,
should the two eggs hatch.

THE 1958 BREEDING SEASON IN CALIFORNIA

It would be rather difficult to recall a year when poorer breeding
results from the psittacine birds in my collection were obtained.
Maybe the results only seem so poor when they are compared with
what was hoped for and expected.
During late 1957 and early 1958 a ten-year cycle of drought appeared
to have ended and there was much more rain than usual for our arid
region. This increased rain doubtless influences fecundity and sub-
sequent breeding results, and the rains were considered to have
improved the general breeding atmosphere. However, in April,
just as most pairs were seriously beginning nesting operations we were
favoured with ten days of torrential downpours, amounting to some
15 inches of rain in the ten-day period. This is the equivalent to a whole
year's supply in ten days ! At any rate this seemed to discourage
the birds, and from that moment on it seemed to be a never-ending
cycle of bad luck.
I have never lost as many good birds in one year as in 1958. A fine
lutino Ringneck, two male Pileated, a young Princess of Wales's,
four Bourkes, and a common Ring-neck all " passed on " since April.
As if these losses (from pneumonia, going light, broken necks, and
other distasteful causes) were not bad enough, other tragedies also
occurred as you will see.
The blue Ringnecks reared three fine youngsters, but then turned
on one baby and scalped it. The youngster was very badly hurt and
it is largely through the efforts of Mr. Ken Perley that a complete
recovery was obtained. Now the bird is a fine specimen, with all
feathers in place, and apparently none the worse for wear. It is

rather unusual for Ring-necks to attack their young when immediately
out of the nest.
Several other pairs of birds hatched young and then allowed them
to starve. As an example, from nine adult breeding pairs of Red-
rumps one solitary youngster was reared by its parents, and two were
reared by hand ! Probably eight to ten young were hatched, and then
neglected for reasons not known to me. Many of these birds were pairs
that had successfully raised fine young in preceding years. A split
male and a yellow Red-rump hen were reared by hand by Mr. Lyle
Wickline. This hen is unusual in that the rump is solid red, yet it
must be a hen as it was bred from a split male and a normal female.
Other pairs, too numerous to mention, had many clear eggs. There
must be some very logical explanation for this poor showing on the
part of such a hardy species as the Red-rump, but it certainly escapes
me. All of the pairs were housed individually, and the smallest
aviary was 12 feet in length. They had been supplied with copious
amounts of green food, fruit, etc. ... I wonder if any of the members
could comment on this ?
While the number of birds bred was very small, the quality of the
young was very satisfactory. Positive results included 4 Superbs,
11 Princess including 2 reared by hand, 2 Crimson-wings, 3 blue
Ring-necks, 9 Bourkes, 1 Pileated, 4 young Ring-necks from a split
male and a normal hen, 7 hybrid Brown's X Yellow Rosellas, 2 Queen
of Bavaria's, 4 Indian Alexandrines, and 4 normal Ring-necks. It was
greatly disappointing that a split male Ring-neck and his blue hen
allowed their three young to die.
Despite the bad results I guess that once the avicultural bug has
infested one it is always a case of " better luck next year ". Certainly
there are some interesting results coming up ... or at least so
I hope. . . .

By E. H. Hawke (Lourengo Marques, Portuguese East Africa)
Since by printing in the issue of November, 1957, a short article
relating some of my experiences, the Editor has implied these were of
interest to at least some readers, I venture to send a further short
account in the hope that this too, will be acceptable.
In the first article I expressed the hope that some of my #c near
successes " would be improved upon during the next breeding season
but again both the African Greys and sunbirds have unhappily
flattered only to deceive. Just why the Greys find it impossible to lay
a fertile egg I do not know, and if only half the number of eggs that
have been laid over the last four to five years had hatched, I would
by now have a colony of very considerable magnitude.
The sunbirds nearly broke my heart. A pair of Scarlet-breasted
(Chalcomitra senegalensis gutturalis) and a pair of Blacks {Chalcomitra
amethystina kirkii ) both laid and the latter actually produced two
chicks which lived four and five days respectively before they were
found dead on the ground below the nest. The deaths were, I feel
convinced, due to my inability to provide a sufficient variety or
volume of the right type of food.
The Scarlet-breasted, for reasons best known to themselves, nested in a
hole in a log which had been provided for Collared Barbets. The
latter hollowed out the log, leaving a ledge of 1 to 2 inches before
scooping out the interior and this ledge was selected by the Scarlet-
breasted. Two eggs were laid but eventually disappeared, either
having fallen into the log or been removed by some other agency.
The Blacks constructed the typical sunbird type of nest, keeping me
and my aviary attendant very busy indeed trying to provide the right
type of cobweb, etc.
Even now I do not know why some is taken and some is not but
the hen who, as noted in my previous article, is the sole home-builder, 1
is very choosy indeed. To supplement the cobweb I supplied teased
wool, fine grass, cotton thread, and indeed anything that I thought
might appeal. At the height of the operation the hen would not
hesitate to alight on my head and try to remove, hair by hair, the very
limited supply that remains. It would tug at my shirt or fly against
my tie and try to pull that to pieces.
Just to make the operation more difficult, the bird decided, of all
places, to build its nest on the leaf stalk of a Paw-Paw tree. This
provided virtually no " grip " and I realized that soon the weight of
the nest would tear it from the stalk so I gave a hand by tying it j
firmly with string. One morning, just before the nest was completed,
</bodyText>
<bodyText confidence="0.993237" page_id="56317468"  page_num="83" year="" vol="">
E. H. HAWKE-BREEDING RESULTS IN LOURENgO MARQUES 83
I found it lying on the ground--the obvious reason being that the
string had proved far too attractive to the various nesting birds which
had succeeded in pulling it all away. With little hope I replaced the
nest, this time fixing it with wire, and to my delight the hen immediately
continued with her work and two days later had laid one egg.
I thought then that my troubles in this particular direction were
over but I was soon disillusioned. The day after the first egg was laid
the leaf stalk broke away and again the nest was on the ground, though
the egg was not broken. I replaced it by wiring the leaf stalk to a stick
and then the latter to the Paw-Paw tree. Again the hen returned,
laid another egg, and proceeded to hatch two chicks which, as already
stated, did not live very long. Surely such persistence deserved a
better fate.
At the time of writing, the same pair of Scarlet-breasted have again
nested and laid two eggs but the hen, I fear, is beginning to lose interest.
The nesting season has not yet got into its stride but I can already
report two breedings that are " firsts 55 as far as my aviaries are con-
cerned. A pair of Natal Robins ( Cossypha natalensis) have young but
I cannot tell how many as the nest is in a box and I do not like to disturb
them. Also my pair of Superb Tanagers (Calliste fastuosa) have two
chicks out of three eggs and are busy feeding, being assisted incidentally
in this work by a male Black-capped Sugar Bird which recently lost
its mate.
Judging from the remarks of Mr. D. H. S. Risdon (. Foreign Birds ,
January, 1957), this breeding, if successful, will be close to a " first".
In the issue of July-August of 1958, Mr. Boosey writes in glowing
terms of that very lovely bird, the Lilac-breasted Roller (Corarias
caudatus). All he says I endorse and there is nothing more beautiful
than one of these in flight. At certain times of the year this roller can
be trapped readily in this area and a large number have passed through
my hands. When they first arrive, forced feeding with raw meat is a
" must " and this is quite a task as they have a bite that is to be
respected. However, if properly handled, and given a supplementary
feed of live grasshoppers, mealworms, or something similar, which
they take fairly readily without assistance, they will soon start taking
the raw meat. I consider ten to fourteen days is about the time
required to have these birds eating unassisted. If fed live food, they
become quite tame and a pair in my aviary will readily come to hand
for a titbit. My experience is they will eat almost anything--meat,
fruit, soaked bread, etc.--though live food is always preferred.
In addition to the Lilac-breasted I have European (Coracias garrulus),
Mozambique (Coracias naevius) , and Broad-billed (Eurystomus glaucurus)
Rollers.

By H. A. Snazle (Chessington Zoo, Surrey, England)
For many years our Macaws (seven Blue-and-yellow and one
Blue-and-red) were kept on individual perches, or in cages. At
Whitsun, 1958, we decided to give them free flight in a building which
we converted for the purpose.
It was during the first week in July that the keeper found an egg,
about the size of a pigeon's, on the floor of the inside quarters. This
he placed in a shallow feeding tin filled with sawdust and chaff, and
a hen Blue-and-yellow Macaw began to sit. Over a period of some
twelve to fifteen days three more eggs were found on the floor ; one
was cracked, but the other two were placed in the nesting tin. In
addition to the sitting hen, another hen bird, and a cock, were never
far away from the nest, and wasted no time in attacking anyone who
went near. We can only think that the presence of the other hen
bird makes ii likely that she was responsible for some of the eggs.
All three birds shared sitting, and there were often two birds on the
nest at the same time.
On Wednesday, 6th August, twenty-eight days after the first egg
was found, an egg was hatched out, but as no results were obtained
from the other two (they were both clear), it is not possible to ascertain
the precise period of incubation.
The chick appeared sturdy, but helpless, and it was three weeks
before it began to move about laboriously on its own legs, and
eleven weeks before it was first seen to feed itself. Its feathers grew
slowly, for the photograph was taken on 24th September, 1958.
However, after this date the feathers grew apace ; by December, apart
from the lack of tail feathers, the bird looked quite adult.

By Keith D. Frost (Bridgetown, Barbados, B.W.I.)
Readers of the Avicultural Magazine may be interested to have
some recent information and news on three very beautiful Amazon
parrots which are native to only a few islands of the West Indies.
The birds to which I refer are A. imperialis of Dominica, A. guildingii
of St. Vincent, and A. versicolor of St. Lucia. In the first place and, as
you know, A. imperialis is very rare but is not extinct. On my last visit
to Dominica, I did see one and only last week news came to me from
that island that a friend of mine there had discovered a pair nesting
very high up in a very high tree. I am trying to obtain a specimen
but at this stage would not care to say what chances I have of doing

so. In Dominica this parrot is referred to as the " Sisserou 55 and I knew
a man there who had one at liberty, the bird was very attached to
him; unfortunately he died and the " Sisserou ", I understand, returned
to its natural habitat.
" Sisserous " lay only two eggs and very high up so that they are very
difficult to get. Although they are protected by law, the natives will
shoot them (if they see them) for food--parrot meat is very tough.
I think that this is the reason for their being almost extinct.
I am very much better acquainted with my favourite --Amazona
guildingii of St. Vincent. I visit St. Vincent yearly and at the present
I have a very nice specimen of this species. The bird is all of 19 inches.
I am going to (or try to) take some colour photographs of it. I am
expecting two more of A. guildingii and will try my utmost to breed
them. For the past five or six years I have been visiting St. Vincent
once yearly and on almost every occasion I have seen them in the
mountains. They are by no means as rare as the imperialis but,
nevertheless, a specimen can be obtained occasionally for about
#3 to # 4 - Like imperialis , they lay two eggs and once a year only.
Unfortunately, instead of increasing they are becoming less and less.
I hate to think what will be their lot in about 20 years. Unless drastic
measures are taken against the natives who destroy them whenever
the opportunity arises, the bird will be extinct before the Great
Imperial.
Guildingii are not very good talkers, their words are by no means
distinct. They do try to talk but the result is disappointing. While
you may not agree with me, I do think that guildingii is the prettiest
of the Amazons from this area.
I have sent to St. Lucia to obtain a pair of their parrots ( A . versicolor)
and a native has gone to the mountains to trap these for me. These
birds are not as rare as is usually thought and I remember that in
1954 I could have purchased one in the market place for W.I. $5.00
(#1 os. iod.). I did not do so at the time as I was travelling through
the Islands and could not take it with me, neither did I have the time
to obtain the necessary Health Certificates, etc., to ship it to my home
in Barbados.
In St. Lucia, the birds are usually caught on a preparation of
bird lime, which lime is made by boiling the " milk " or sap of the
breadfruit tree to a very thick consistency. One has to be very careful
when travelling through the area A. versicolor inhabits as this area
is frequented by the deadly fer-de-lance.

I expect most of the members of the Avicultural Society will have
read at one time or another of an experiment carried out by the late
Sir William Ingram, of London, in 1909. He learned that the Greater
Bird of Paradise, a native of the Aru Islands, was in danger of becoming
extinct owing to the demands by collectors for their wonderful plumes.
They were slaughtered in thousands and their numbers were being
depleted very rapidly. Sir William looked around for an island with
a climate similar to that which they already enjoyed and finally
settled on Little Tobago, situated about two miles from the main
island of Tobago in the Caribbean close to the Equator, and far
removed from the hunters. In 1912, the late Mr. Erost collected
twenty-six pairs of these beautiful birds and liberated them on Little
Tobago Island. This island is now known as Bird of Paradise Island.
In February of this year, I visited Trinidad and while there took
the opportunity to fly over to Tobago. I went to the north of the
island and stayed for a couple of days in Bird of Paradise Inn at
Speyside. From there I was able to make the necessary arrangements
to visit the island and see, if I was very lucky, some of these Greater
Birds of Paradise. The island is now under the care of a Superintendent
and Guide--named Jeremiah George--who takes a great interest in
the birds, knows their feeding times and places, and will conduct
interested visitors to points where they may be seen.
It is necessary to arrive on the island before sunrise, and so my
host, Mr. Lau, called me at 5 o'clock in the morning, provided me
with some breakfast and suggested that I should take with me a pair
of binoculars. He also provided a boat with an outboard motor and
three men to take me out to the island. We set off in darkness and in
due time arrived at a little landing stage just before dawn. We climbed
up the side of the thickly wooded hill and arrived at the cottage
belonging to Jeremiah the Warden. He then brought us along a
narrow path up the side of the hill, rising to a height of about 900 feet,
and then, as dawn began to break and the pale flush of sunrise came
over the sky, we heard the first call of a male bird to his hens. These
quickly answered, and in a very short time three or four had gathered
together at a patch of pawpaw and banana trees, which had been
planted some years ago especially to provide food for them. They
flew around for quite a while before settling down to feed and we
were able to see three cocks and a couple of hens. The cocks, of
course, were easier to pick out owing to their brighter colouring.
I thought that because of their golden yellow plumes they would be
very easy to see amidst the green leaves of the trees, but this was not

so ; they seemed to blend remarkably well with the foliage and were
very difficult to see as long as they remained perfectly still. However,
the cocks soon started to call and dance on the branches, then it was
possible to observe them very easily, and a beautiful sight they were.
We stayed until about 7.30 a.m. watching them fly from tree to tree.
I had hoped to get some photographs of them and to take some film,
but I quickly realized that this would be quite impossible unless one
built a hide specially for the purpose and, of course, we had no time
to do this so I had to be content with just watching them without
taking any pictures. They were a wonderful sight and one that I shall
not forget for a very long time.
I talked to Jeremiah about their numbers and he told me that
when they were released on the island originally, their numbers were
depleted very rapidly because other birds were getting the food
provided for them, and they did not settle down for quite a long time.
However, they are now believed to have bred to the third generation
and their numbers are increasing. I believe there are about thirty-five
birds in adult plumage and a few youngsters which have not yet attained
full colour. It is very difficult to take a census as no nest or nesting
site has ever been found. One thing that can be said is that the birds
now appear to be breeding well, feeding well, and are in first-class
condition. They are not strong fliers and so never stray from the
island, and none has ever been found on the mainland. They do not
appear to have any natural enemies and, as nobody is allowed on the
island with firearms, their future looks reasonably well assured ; indeed
everybody on Tobago hopes that this may be so as they are a splendid
tourist attraction and one which I would not willingly have missed.
In 1958, Mr. E. Thomas Gilliard, the Associate Curator of Birds at
the American Museum of Natural History, paid a visit to the island
for the purpose of observing and photographing the birds and taking
films of their mating dance and display. In this, he was very successful
and his pictures have been reproduced in the National Geographical
Magazine dated September, 1958.
PS. Since writing the above notes I have been browsing through
some early volumes of the Magazine and have discovered in the Third
Series, Volume V, year 1913-1914, page 35, a very interesting article
on the Birds of Paradise in the West Indies, written by Collingwood
Ingram, a son of Sir William Ingram who purchased the island and
arranged for the birds to be sent there. The information contained in
this article is much the same as I have written, but in greater detail
and with a much more readable style. I found it most interesting as
I am sure our readers will. It fills in a number of gaps in my notes and
for this reason I draw attention to it. I think it also proves that the
experiment so boldly undertaken in 1909 may be said in this year of
grace 1959--fifty years later--to be a great success.

By J. L. Throp, Curator, Buteyn Bird Ranch (San Luis Rey,
California, U.S.A.)
A very fine aviculturist, Bernard Roer, of Phoenix, Arizona, talked
of Mexico to me several times after a trip he had made there. His
enthusiasm was infectious and we soon laid plans for a trip. He said
that he had seen lots of birds and although he was not prepared to
handle them, he brought back three. Unfortunately, at the border,
the United States customs officials refused to admit the birds and they
were confiscated. Well in advance of our trip I wrote to Washington,
stating what birds we would like to import, approximately how many
of each species, date of importation, and so forth, requesting a permit
to bring them in.
Our first trip was planned, in that we took suitable boxes for easy
handling, camping paraphernalia, Blake's book on The Birds of
Mexico and Edward's book Finding Birds in Mexico , road maps, and
money. What we were not at all sure of was what kinds of birds we
might find to bring home and if we could locate suitable help in
Mexico to catch the types we wanted. Luck was certainly on our
side, as it often is with the unenlightened. Bernard had a friend living
at Tepic, in the state of Nayarit, Lewis Yeager. He had been an avid
aviculturist in Phoenix. On retiring from active business after a
serious leg injury he had moved to Tepic three years earlier and
married a very fine lady of an old Mexican family. Bernard Roer
wrote to the Yeagers, telling them that we were after birds. They
invited us to use their home as a base and Lewis offered to help us
all he could to get some fine birds.
We left Phoenix on the 29th September, 1957, and spent the month
of October in a most happy adventure. Another bit of luck was to
greet us on our arrival at the Yeagers' house for they also had as
guest Dr. Allen Phillips, one of America's finest ornithologists. He
and Yeager were collecting bird skins from the state of Nayarit in
preparation to writing a book on the subject. Dr. Phillips was a great
help in introducing the Mexican birds to us.
Our work for the first few days was to contact local bird trappers,
if possible. They are somewhat migratory and there was some doubt
that anybody was working in the Tepic area at that time. We
did eventually locate one family of men who made a living at trapping
birds and from them we learned of another family in the area and of
a man in Tuxpan about 40 miles to the north of Tepic. We stirred
them up with the promise of a ready sale for native birds. In the
following days we did a lot of canvassing around the small towns in a

radius of 50 miles of Tepic. We would make an inquiry as to who
had birds in that pueblo and usually we found several people with a
bird or two. The main trouble here was that most of the caged birds
were either parrots or wild doves or pigeons. Both of these are not
allowed in the U.S. without quarantine. The difficulties with
quarantine are oppressive so we were determined not to become
involved with those types of birds. We did, however, find a few nice
softbills and bought them, providing that the lady of the house
consented to sell them, often she did not. Mexican people dearly
love their birds ; if there was an avicultural society in Mexico, half of
the people would belong. The other half would be little children and
foreigners. Dr. Phillips is often called " malo gringo 55 because he
kills birds.
Other days were spent in the jungles with Dr. Phillips and Lewis
Yeager while they hunted. We learned a world full of ornithological
information on these trips. Allen Phillips and his note-book were
inseparable, with a code system he recorded every trifle of information
concerning every bird that he saw or heard. It was most interesting
to see how nothing seemed to escape his eye. He had spent his life
working on the birds of the United States until recently ; he considers
the birds of the tropics as something out of a dream world and his avid
search for more knowledge of them promises to keep him young the
rest of his life.
I had always thought it a waste when a beautiful bird died in our
aviaries and I had long wished for the ability to preserve the skins
of those birds that we had loved and lost. The cotton-filled body of a
bird cannot hold the beauty of a living one, but still that beauty is
not entirely lost; also, the preserved skin may be of some value to
museum collections. This was the perfect opportunity to learn the
art of making a study skin and Dr. Phillips was an expert teacher.
Some day I would like to share the knowledge with fellow aviculturists,
in the pages of this magazine.
In these days spent in the jungles with Phillips and Yeager we were
introduced to many new species as well as seeing some of our favourite
aviary inhabitants in the wild state. We often saw Military Macaws
flying overhead and calling as they went, and Petz's Conures,
Spectacled Amazons, and Finsch's Amazon Parrots feeding in the trees.
Along the roads the ridiculous Grooved-billed Anis were often seen.
They are a loose feathered, dull, black bird that never seems to get
excited over anything. One of the most distinctive birds of the area
is the Collie Magpie-Jay, a very large blue jay with a black bib and
face markings, a loosely feathered crest, and an extremely long tail.
What a beautiful sight it is to see a flock of these jays sailing through
the scrub with their long tails streaming along behind them. We were
only able to obtain one of these jays on the first trip. We found it in a

small bamboo cage hanging in a Mexican garden ; it had no tail
and probably never had, since the cage was too small to allow it.
Bernard pulled out the stubs of the broken feathers and by the time
we reached home the bird had a good start on a beautiful tail. On the
second trip we obtained four of these jays. A curious thing about them
was that two had the black bib while the other two had grey bibs
with a black band bordering it. Later we saw this same difference
in wild birds of the same flock. I made several inquiries about it and
the Mexican people believed that the grey throated ones were young.
However, there was some doubt about it and I believe that it is a
variation in the species. Neither Yeager nor Phillips know enough
about the species as yet to know the answer. These four birds should
prove for certain the difference, whether they are young or a new
model.
Tepic is situated in a large valley surrounded by a great variety of
habitats. There are densely jungled mountains to the west and pine-
covered mountains to the east. In the valley are vast stretches of
sugar cane, truck farms, and grazing pasture. The mountains to the
west slope down into coastal flood plains where the varieties of shore
and wading birds are numerous. We saw several species of herons,
ibises, the Roseate Spoonbill, Anhingas, and many more in these
flood plains. One day while we were sliding through the water in a
dugout canoe we came upon a family of Boat-billed Herons. They
are very uncommon and it was a treat to be able to study them, they
were not in the least afraid.
We were assembling quite a few birds, just from talking to different
people and purchasing a bird here and there. The trappers had
indifferent luck at first, but by the time we were ready to return they
had a nice variety of birds.
The " Jilguero 55 was the trappers' greatest prize. It is the Brown-
backed Solitaire in Blake's book, but the Mexicans know it simply
as the "Jilguero", and they love it. In the forested canyons we
would often hear one sing, to be answered by a male across the canyon,
then another still farther away. Their song is a strange musical jargon,
like something you would expect Shostakovitch to compose. It has a
humorous twist that always leaves me with a half smile. I am sure
that the Mexicans feel the same way about it; we would see or hear
this bird in small cages in homes all over the area, but nearly always
they would refuse to part with it.
A bird closely related to the "Jilguero" is the " Clarino " or
Slate-coloured Solitaire ; this bird is not found around Tepic but on
the higher plateau country around Mexico City. This bird is a real
musician and its clear fluting notes cleanse the heart. Where the
"Jilguero " leaves a smile, the " Clarino " leaves a brief mental quiet.
By the time we had gathered everything up in preparation to

leave, we were amazed to have eighty birds of twenty-one species, a
baby coati mundi, and a kitten ocelot. Certainly this far exceeded
our expectations. We acquired the coati mundi by accident. We had
been searching for caged birds in the small town of Tuxpan and we
were about to give it up, there just was not anything available in the
pueblo. A small boy stepped up to the car window and asked if we
were interested in a Tejon. I asked him what a Tejon was and he
replied, " A Tejon, Senor, is a Tejon." So I asked if it was a young
one, I didn't wish to seem so completely ignorant of what a Tejon was.
He said that it was and he got into the car and proceeded to direct us
to the house of the Tejon. He was not too sure of just which house
the object of our search resided in, so he would ask every Senora that
we passed. One lady finally knew the location, by saying that it was
the house next to the Hallelujahs. " What are Hallelujahs ? " I asked,
and Lewis Yeager said that in Nayarit Hallelujahs are Protestants
and everybody knows them because they are so uncommon. We
found that a Tejon was a coati mundi and as it was indeed a young
and tame animal it would be difficult to resist buying it, so we did not
even try. The ocelot kitten belonged to Yeager and he gave it to us,
which explains the second mammalian acquisition.
When we left Tepic we could honestly say that we had a capacity
load of livestock. In two days time we reached the border (about a
thousand miles). We were fortunate to have had good weather : both
the week before our return to the U.S. and the week after our return,
the west coast of Mexico was torn by severe hurricane storms which
caused damage and delays to the traffic using the highway. At the
border of Mexico and the U.S. we were greeted with the news that
they did not have a permit to let us through and we suffered a grievous
five hour delay which was only terminated when I put a call through
to Washington that won us a release. After we had arrived home and
got the birds settled, I began to do some honest research into the art
of importing. I wrote letters, and more letters, so that in the end
I was armed to the teeth. On the second trip I flashily displayed
the reams of correspondence to the border officials and we sailed
across the border within fifteen minutes and it was done without
permits or formal approval. That was the ice cream, the result of all
that corresponding. In the United States our birds are protected and
it is unlawful to hold them captive, so all birds that are not migratory
between the U.S. and Mexico, and that are not psittacine birds or
game birds, may be brought into the country without permit. Border
officials do not realize this and it takes visual proof to convince them.
The second collecting trip was made in January, 1959, into the
same area and after much the same birds. This time we were better
prepared, since we knew what to expect. We had travelling cages
made to carry birds individually or in small groups of five or six.

J. J. YEALLAND-LONDON ZOO NOTES
We had better foods and medicines, better feeding and watering
devices. It all helped, and here is the proof--we left Tepic with 114
birds and we only lost one bird (eight died on previous trip). That
one was a female Cacique that had been trapped just hours before
our departure.
One innovation on this trip that was not enjoyed on the first was the
Japanese mist nets. They were used to catch some of the larger birds.
The mist net is made of very fine nylon thread and is the next thing
to invisible when it is stretched up, thus the name mist net. It is
constructed in such a way that a bird striking it from either side forces
a pocket in the loose netting and is held captive. All of the birds that
were caught, but not held for exportation, were banded and released.
United States Fish and Wildlife bands were used on all birds that
will migrate north into our country this spring. Such banded birds
are a service in finding migration routes below the border and in
establishing the relationship of summer and winter homes of our birds.
There are no further plans in the offing for another collecting trip
into this area, but if there were we are sure that it could not surpass
the enjoyment that we have already experienced in Mexico.

An interesting bird has been presented by Mr. P. H. Maxwell. It
is the Red-and-Yellow Barbet ( Trachyphonus erythrocephalus) , of eastern
parts of Africa, a species new to the Collection.
A specimen of Loriculus philippensis has also been presented. It is
L. p. regulus, and the distribution of this race is, according to Peters,
Guimaras and Negros in the central Philippines. This Hanging
Parrakeet, which has a wide band of yellow on the crown, is called
by McGregor the Central Island Colasisi.

depart before we are aware of the fact. It has been suggested that
members intending to visit England should notify the Hon. Secretary

The main part of the magnificent collection of parrakeets owned by
the late M. J. Bruyneel, of Steenokkerzeel, Belgium, was sold by
auction on 3rd March, 1959. Some very high prices were realized
in a total of about #3,600. A number of pairs had previously been
sold privately, so that the full total must have been considerably in
excess of this sum. A peculiar lack of appreciation was shown by
the buyers in that whereas eight normal Quaker Parrakeets fetched
#28, nine blues went for only #53.

Peter A. Pope writes : " It may interest you to know that a friend
of mine has a 1958 Mandarin Drake flying loose. It circles round with
a flock of pigeons and lands on the roof of the house. It likes to search
the gutter along the roof when it is raining, and also inspects the
dove-cote and the nesting-sites of the pigeons. We suspect that is why
the pigeon population has not greatly increased this past season.
Although quite near the marshes, where larger flocks of Mallard are
to be found, this Mandarin shows no sign of wishing to mix with them,
even when they pass overhead."

PHOENIX RE-BORN. By Maurice Burton. Published by
Hutchinson, London, 1959. Price 25.?.
The legend of the phoenix is widespread throughout classical
literature and even down to the middle ages there was a popular belief
in the existence of a bird that burnt itself to death on its own nest and
later was resurrected. Medieval pictures of the bird generally show
it with a hooked beak, sitting on a burning nest with its wings out-
spread, but there is no general agreement as to the shape of the bird.
The author describes the extraordinary behaviour of various birds
which may contain the key to the myth of the phoenix. A tame male
Rook in his possession living in an aviary, was seen disporting itself on
a heap of burning straw. With flames enveloping the lower part of its
body the bird flapped its wings, snatched at the burning embers and
seemed to be trying to put them under its wings. Every now and then
it would pose in the flames with its wings outstretched and head turned
to one side exactly in the manner shown in pictures of the phoenix.
Another Rook in the author's possession showed a fondness for playing
with matches and could even strike them. It also turned on electric
fires and hot water taps and enjoyed the steam from kettles. A tame
Jay was fond of lighted cigarettes and would rub them under its
wings. This behaviour seemed very suggestive of the phenomenon of
anting which has become much better known in recent years. It may
be recalled that when anting a bird picks up an ant in its bill and at
the same time spreads its wings, curving them forwards. The details
may vary in different species but this posture is usually accompanied
by twisting the tail under the body and then rubbing the ant up and
down under the feathers of one of the wings. After having anted once
the performance may be repeated. The bigger the bird and brighter
its plumage the more remarkable it appears and the author mentions
that he has induced birds to ant before numerous visitors to his aviaries
all of whom had never previously seen the performance and were duly
impressed.
The author has collected a very extensive series of observations on
these and allied phenomena both from personal communications and
also from the literature and devotes a section of his book to speculations
and possible explanations. He concludes by giving a list of 150 species
of birds recorded as anting, including a large number commonly kept
in aviaries. The book throws new light on a peculiar and little known
type of animal behaviour and will be of absorbing interest to avi-
culturists as well as to the general naturalist.

The Dangers of Feeding Seed Mixtures in which is Incorporated Egg Yolk
The following statement received from Mr. R. N. Fiennes, M.A., M.R.C.V.S.,
Pathologist of the Zoological Society of London, is of urgent importance to all
aviculturists :--
A letter has been sent by my colleague O. Graham-Jones, Veterinary Officer,
Zoological Society of London, and myself, as Pathologist, to the Veterinary Record.
The importance of the observation described is obvious and it seems to us that
keepers of cage-birds should be warned in every way possible about the dangers of
feeding seed mixtures in which is incorporated egg yolk to their pets. It is more
than probable that a great many unexplained deaths amongst Psittacines and other
grain-eating birds may be attributable to the transmission of infection in dried egg.
A very large quantity of this type of egg is imported annually from China and is
a source of embarrassment to the public health authorities because of the danger of
transmission from it of enteric organisms. It is used for a variety of commercial
purposes, such as the manufacture of artificial cream. It has been known for a long
time that eggs may harbour enteric organisms, ducks' eggs being more dangerous
than hens' eggs.
The following is a copy of the letter in question :--
" Recently two African Grey Parrots were presented to the Out-patients' Depart-
ment for examination. One of these birds showed a slight mucous discharge from
one nostril but there was no history of serious disease at all. During the course of
the examination it was noticed that the birds had excreted green faecal material
which is, of course, not normal. Material was submitted for bacteriological
examination.
The faecal material was seeded in selenite broth and plated in D.C. and McGonkey
medium from the selenite. On culture, some white colonies were found which were
picked for further study. These proved, by biochemical examination, and on both
tube and slide agglutination, to be a Salmonella of the Taksony/Senftenberg group.
The owner had been questioned as to whether any egg or egg product was fed
to the parrot and stated that the only egg product supplied was the dried egg yolk
included in the parrots' seed mixture. She therefore sent a sample of this egg and
this was treated bacteriologically in the same way as the stool sample. The egg
sample produced a rich growth of Bacillus coli and in addition a Salmonella of the
same group as from the stool sample was isolated from it.
It has been shown by one of us (Fiennes, 1959) that Bacillus coli is one of the major
alimentary pathogens in Psittacidae and the discovery, therefore, in the dried egg
yolk, presumably of Chinese origin, that both Bacillus coli and a pathogenic Salmonella
were present is of obvious interest and importance. The desirability of mixing these
egg products in seed mixtures for Psittacines or any grain-eating birds is obviously
open to question."

INBREEDING OF GEESE.

I was very pleased to read Mr. Laidlay's letter in your last issue. Whilst I agree
that some species of geese take three years to become mature, no less an authority
than Dr. Konrad Lorenz states in his well-known book, King Solomon&amp;apos;s Ring, that "jack-
daws, like wild geese, become betrothed in the spring following their birth, but neither
species becomes sexually mature till twelve months later, thus the normal period of
betrothal is exactly a year ".
I would suggest that this supports my contention that in a state of nature, brother
and sister matings must be quite common.

THE PURPLE WHYDAH
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.984096833333333" page_id="56317483"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
With regard to the remarks by Mr. Yealland on the Purple Whydah I exhibited
at the National, I am afraid that I shall not be able to provide photographs yet
awhile for the reason given below, but I can at least add a little to the information
given in Roberts's book.
On receipt of the bird last August in a mixed consignment from my friend in South
Africa--Basutoland--it was out of colour and I took it for rather a fine specimen of a
Paradise Whydah. The markings, so far as I can now recall, were very similar but it
appeared to be a trifle larger than the normal. Anyway I kept it, hoping it would
turn out to be a Yellow-naped or Broad-tailed Paradise. However, as it began to
come into colour it gradually darkened all over and I began to fear it was a melanistic
specimen. Slowly a sheen came on the plumage and, in the sunlight, this showed \
distinctive metallic purple lights. I can only conclude that this sheen is the reason for
it to be named Purple, for in ordinary lighting it merely shows as black. I actually ;
identified it from the coloured plate in Roberts's book for the brownish markings on the |
wings are very clear. The reason why I am not at the moment providing photographs
is because the bird is beginning to go out of colour (it was in colour for 14 weeks only)
and has dropped its tail feathers. These plumes are not as long as those of the Paradise,
being only 16 and 21 cms. in length. Further they have no wires. I shall wait until
it is fully out of colour and then endeavour to get a series of photographs.
It has quite a pleasant song, similar to the Queen Whydah's but a little coarser,
which it precedes with a harsh chattering series of notes. Excluding the tail, the overall
length of the bird is about 22 cms., and it has the typical Whydah stance of 75 0 to the ;
horizontal.

THE TREATMENT OF SICK BIRDS BY INJECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.986225862068966" page_id="56317483"  page_num="96" year="" vol="">
The summer of 1958, as all readers will remember, was wet and sunless and was
followed by an equally damp and soggy autumn which left the majority of birds
in our aviaries ill-fitted to stand the rigours of an Irish winter, and very prone to
chills, pneumonia, and other attendant disorders.
By the end of November, a few of the less hardy specimens had shuffled off this
mortal coil and a number of others were on the way out. Mr. Murphy, Superintendent
of the Dublin Zoo, was really worried about the number of sick birds on hand--
parrots, parrakeets, and even toucans were feeling the effects of the bad weather.
All the usual treatments were tried, with varying degrees of success, and rather in a
last hope, he decided to try injections of penicillin, Chloromycetin or intramycetin,
of which intramycetin proved to be the most satisfactory. The injections were given
into the breast of the birds, into what appeared to be the most meaty part, and the
needle was not put in at right-angles to the breast but rather pushed in along the
line of the feathers. In the case of large parrots, 1 c.c. was given and smaller birds
^ c.c. and the results, to say the least, were wonderful.
A Sulphur-breasted Toucan, a bird which was really very sick and appeared to be
on its last legs, having been given # c.c. of triplopen penicillin at about 9 o'clock
in the evening was sitting on its perch and feeding well at 9 o'clock the following
morning. It then had a second injection, and since then has never looked back.
Two Grey Parrots also had several injections with great benefit to them. The
injections did not appear to cause any shock to the birds and, in fact, distressed them
much less than endeavouiing to give them a similar dose orally. They were kept
warm but no extra heat was provided, just plenty of water and seed. One of the
Grey Parrots was very far gone and it took about three injections before it was
right. Of the nine birds treated, seven made a complete recovery and it was felt that
this result was sufficiently impressive to warrant writing these few notes in the hope
that they might help other members of the Society who have from time to time their
usual quota of sick birds to treat.

The delay in publication of the magazine is due to circumstances
beyond our control, namely the printing dispute. It was therefore
decided to publish a double number---July/August and September/
October--which it was hoped to produce on the publication date of the
latter, but disorganization resulting from the dispute has caused yet
further delay.
The Avicultural Magazine has appeared regularly for 65 years,
even during the Boer War and the two World Wars, and therefore
the present delay is particularly regrettable.

The note from K. G. Lint telling of the breeding results of screamers
in America prompts me to write of a pair of Horned Screamers that
I have kept for nearly a year. They were imported by an Edinburgh
dealer along with two others and even at this space of time I feel
grateful to him for his patience with me, as I changed my mind and
changed my mind again in making up a pair. They were all babies,
but the two I took " peeped " their baby " peeps " at different
pitches, and encouraged me to hope that they might be of different
sexes. I still hope they may be a pair for there is a slight difference
in eye-colour, the " female " being a pale washed-out gold while the
other has a faintly richer tint. The smaller bird that I have designated
" male " is the more active and demonstrative and has begun to give
the hollow rumbling bellow of its kind.

The species is rarely imported and although I have done some
research, little seems to have been written about it. The species,
although not beautiful, is certainly interesting ; for example, in these
juveniles the feathers of the mantle and " mane " all carried peduncu-
late tips which fluttered loosely and eventually became broken off.
The bird is one great emphysematous air-sac, even the tips of the
toes are inflated and the wings bear not one, but three, pairs of spurs,
two long and sharp as those on a Green Peacock and the third, a
little boss, whose existence seems to have escaped the systematists.
My birds are very tame, but accidentally one bird struck my neck
as it extended its wing in greeting me and gave me a very painful
blow. For a bird of the duck tribe it has amazingly extensive wings,
shaped and patterned much like some of the griffon group of
vultures ; in soaring flight they must look spectacular. So handsome
were the wings of my birds that I could not bring myself to clip
them, nor to pinion them, and I have tenectomised them to preserve
them intact. On my birds the horn, which eventually extends for
about six inches from the crown, is still only a short worm-tip.
At first the feeding gave me much worry for they would eat nothing
but lettuce, refusing all other kinds of green-food. I attempted to
accustom them to a more varied diet by including bread crumbs and
other finely divided food among their chopped lettuce. Despite this
they extracted the lettuce skilfully and ate only the crumbs adhering
to it. They were doomed to more spartan fare, however, for in the
autumn after the death of my manager, I had to desert my birds for
the sterner affair of earning a living and all the birds were left in the
unsupervised care of an inexperienced young lad. The screamers
survived and now eat biscuit meal, turkey starter, and favour unsoaked
wheat above all other food. They crop young grass, but seem to graze
most during the dusk.
In behaviour they show their anseriform affinities. The general
gait of unhurried big-footed clumsiness and their perching habits
remind me of the Magpie Geese I kept some years ago. When the
" pair " has been separated the reunion ceremony is very shelduck-
like though played through in slow motion. The distant recognition
extension of the wings and a slow flapping is just like a grazing
shelduck. A nearer approach causes the " male " to inflate his crop
region in much the same way as an Orinoco Goose. Closer approach
causes a really shelduck-like nodding and greeting ceremony, with the
necks moderately extended, that of the " female 55 held lower and
nearly horizontal while the " male 5 5 holds his neck more erect again
copying the posture of the shelduck. When the birds are within a few
feet of each other the fully extended wings are raised high above the
back, the neck arched, and this posture may be held for a period of
seconds in a heraldic manner. Higher intensity display consists of a

raising of the arched wings, especially by the " male " and here again
the wing on the side away from the mate is raised much higher than
the other reminding me much of the posture in certain tadornines
and of the post-coital posture adopted by Casarca and Chloephaga .
They are peaceable birds, but when approached too closely by a
small bird they " nod " at it, while a larger bird causes the Screamers
to raise the flexed wings with an arched neck and often to give some
vocal demonstration. I would commend a study of the behaviour of
the screamers to students of the more developed Anseriformes.
One aspect of their behaviour has delighted me and that is their
amazing facility for learning certain things, combined with their
delightful imperturbability. Last summer they were housed in a stable
and when the weather was suitable, they were set to graze in the
garden. Usually they were " walked " from the stable but when
their slowness taxed my patience I would take one under each arm
and carry them. During the first week of the garden visits, when they
had certainly not more than six experiences of the journey from the
garden to the stable, the gate had been left open unnoticed for a short
time during the visit of a group of young people. When late evening
came, I looked in vain for the Screamers throughout the garden and,
fearing that my tenectomy had been unsuccessful, I had begun to
think them fled away. As a last chance, hoping that someone had
returned them to the stable unknown to me, I went to see and was
delighted to find them sitting patiently outside the loose-box door
waiting to be let in. To get there they had to cross a roadway and
then to make three choices of turns in a minor maze, and I was
certainly amazed at their prompt recognition of the route. After that,
each morning the garden gate and the loose-box doors were opened
and the birds left to find their way unhurriedly. At night when the
time came they were invariably to be found waiting the chance to
plod back to the stable. They have now been put in an enclosure
for the summer with a night ark for a shelter. The first night they
were driven into the ark, but on the evening of the second day I was
not surprised to find them in the ark deep in the straw settled in for
the night, having put themselves to bed.

The conditions of the trade in and transport of birds were dealt with
in an article which appeared in 1958 in the September/October number
of the Magazine and comments were invited. In the November/
December number of the same year the comments received from
Messrs. John Yealland, Tom Spence and Derek Goodwin were
published. The following comments have now been received from
Dr Reginald E. B. Brown, of New South Wales, Australia :--
" I want to say how much I agree with an article by Mr Risdon in
a recent issue of the Avicultural Magazine about the proper aims
of aviculture. I am happy to state that quite a bit of this has been
done in Australia--especially since the ban on the import of all birds
was imposed at the end of the war. Quite a lot of the African finches
are now well established here--some of them, e.g. Guthroat, Gordon
Bleu, Ruddy, Orange-breast, Melba and Munia are far more plentiful
than they ever were when freely imported. The Madagascar Weaver,
too, is quite plentiful--Red and Blue-headed Parrot Finches are coming
along nicely--also Namaqua Doves and Bleeding-heart Pigeons, whilst
the Grenadier Weaver is also obtainable. Also some of the Asiatic
Munias are being bred. Of course all these birds rear their young on
white ants so they are comparatively easy to breed in Australia where
the ants can nearly always be obtained.
Some of the African lovebirds are also becoming plentiful, fortun-
ately in pure strains. Peach-faced are quite common, Nyasas are
coming on (both normal and a few only lutino).
I reported previously my own efforts with Tanagers. I am also
having some success with African Glossy Starlings. X have 19 now--
unfortunately I only had two to start with and there are no others
for a change of blood.
I would like to warn members that some Australian birds at present
fairly common are not likely to remain so for long--e.g. Barraband's
and Yellow Rosellas. These birds have very restricted habitats--
and this country is developing so rapidly and the bush is changing
so much--that habitats are likely to be destroyed at any time--
sometimes one visits an area that one has not seen for a few years and
finds it quite unrecognizable. Some time ago I visited a spot some
distance west of Sydney where I saw a flock of Magpie Geese when
I was a boy--it is now a busy shopping centre and one would not
see a Magpie Goose within a thousand miles of this place.
Concerning inbreeding in birds. The millions of European Sparrows
and Starlings in Australia are said to be descended from two dozen
pairs of each. If so, and I think this is correct, they must be very inbred.
There are possibly more of them here now than there are in Europe
and I assure you they are very vigorous and extremely fertile. 35

Action taken by the Avicultural Society
At the Council meeting of the Society held on ioth November, 1958,
it was decided to set up a Sub-Committee to examine the conditions
under which birds are imported and transported and the following
were appointed : Miss Phyllis Barclay-Smith, Mr G. S. Mottershead,
Mr C. M. Payne and Mr J. J. Yealland (Convener). The Sub-
Committee has met three times and their first consideration has been
the type of transport box that should be advocated for different species
of birds, though the whole question, including conditions in dealers'
shops, will be dealt with. In addition it was agreed that, in view of
the appalling condition of a consignment of birds held up at Nairobi
airport in June 1958 which was reported in the East African Standard ,
the President should send a letter to that paper setting forth the views
of aviculturists on the matter. The following letter duly appeared in
the East African Standard on 1st December 1958 :--
As President of the Avicultural Society, I wish to express on behalf of the
Council of that Society, their condemnation of the bad condition, as reported in
your columns, of a consignment of birds at Nairobi Airport, and their welcome
of the measures of control for the export of birds which have been introduced.
The Avicultural Society deprecates the infringement of the law of any country
and is equally anxious for the preservation of rare species, and the prevention of
cruelty in any form, as the animal protection societies. At the last meeting of
our Council a special committee was set up to go into the whole question of the
conditions of transport of birds by air.
In the preservation of rare species aviculture is playing an ever more important
role, by building up stocks in captivity of species which are in danger of becoming
extinct in the wild state. To quote one example--the Nene Goose of Hawaii,
which had fallen to dangerously low numbers in the wild, has been bred in
captivity with such success that it will soon be possible to liberate captive-bred
birds to re-inforce the wild stock on the island. Among other examples may be
mentioned species of Pheasants and Parrots.
It has been stated that many lovebirds find their way to small cages in private
houses in England, but no aviculturist would keep a lovebird except in an aviary,
and I certainly have never seen one in a cage. I think this statement may have
resulted over a confusion in names, for Budgerigars are frequently referred to as
lovebirds. Budgerigars, which have been bred in captivity for generations, are
great favourites as pets.

In February 1959 the British Standards Institution set up a
Technical Committee on the Carriage of Live Animals by Air--to
quote from the British Standards Institution News of April 1959 :--
" The welfare of day-old chicks and Rhesus monkeys is among the objects of
a new committee of experts which hopes to lay down British Standard recommenda-
tions for the carriage of live animals by air.
Although a somewhat unusual assignment for a B.S.I. technical committee it
was felt that in the absence of any other all-embracing national organization, the
B.S.I. was probably the best forum in which to establish rules for the safe packaging
and transport by air of live animals.
As London Airport and other British aerodromes are transit points for a large
proportion of animals being shipped between one country and another it was

thought that the Institution's close links with the standards organizations of other
nations would be an additional advantage in getting standard proposals agreed
to internationally.
The committee of experts which is now to begin the task of laying down
standards includes representatives of major airlines, air transport firms such as
Thomas Cook's and Lep Transport, the Zoological Society, the R.S.P.C.A.,
Universities Federation for Animal Welfare, Medical Research Council, Poultry
Association of Great Britain and the Ministry of Agriculture. The Chairman
is Dr. W. Lane-Petter of the Medical Research Council and a noted authority
on animal welfare.
This committee hopes to draft standards covering all aspects of air transport
of animals with special reference to the design of suitable containers, ventilation,
feeding, watering and so forth.
Priority is being given to arrangements for the carriage of day-old chicks.
Urgent consideration will also be given to the transport of monkeys."
It was decided to divide the work between three sub-committees
to deal with (i) birds and reptiles, (2) mammals and (3) fish, amphibia
and invertebrates.
The Avicultural Society was invited to nominate representatives
both on the main Committee and also on the sub-committee on birds.

and Mr Mottershead were appointed. Mr Yealland was elected
Chairman of the Sub-Committee dealing with birds and reptiles and
a number of meetings have been held. Two of these were attended
by Mr C. S. Webb when he was in this country for a short time and
whose advice and experience were of the highest value.
The problems are very complex and the formulation of recommenda-
tions must take some time, but when they are finally accepted as a
British standard, it is hoped that conditions will be considerably
improved. Apart from the standard of suitable transport cases there
is the far more complex problem of the human element--the proper
care of birds en route and in transit, stowing on the aircraft, and
long delays through customs, all of which are extremely difficult to
deal with.
Members of the Society will be kept informed of progress made
and comments and suggestions will be welcomed by the Editor.

SUCCESSFUL BREEDING OF THE STREAMER-

<bodyText confidence="0.969432414634146" page_id="56317500"  page_num="103" year="" vol="">
(Trochilus polytmus)
By Ronald T. Reuther, General Curator, and Harold G. Lamm,
Curator of Birds (Cleveland Zoological Park, Ohio, U.S.A.)
An event of great rarity is the hatching, in captivity, of any species
of hummingbird.
Captain R. S. de Quincy of Marden, Hereford, England, was the
first to report * the hatching, in captivity, of Streamer-tailed
Hummingbirds. Two chicks of this species hatched in June, 1958, at
his aviary in Marden. One of the chicks died 21 days later, as did
the hen. The second chick died about one week later.
Thus, it was with great anticipation that the staff of the Cleveland
Zoo observed the initial breeding behavior of a pair of Streamer-
tailed Hummingbirds in their " hummingbird habitat " flight cage at
the Cleveland Zoo. The male was received June 21, 1956, and the
female July 9, 1957, both as adult birds. Within two or three weeks
they were put together in the habitat cage which also contained
several other species of Hummingbirds, White-eyes, Sunbirds, Yuhinas,
etc. This exhibit measures 6&amp;apos; 3&amp;quot; wide by 9&amp;apos; 6&amp;quot; high by 17&amp;apos; 9&amp;quot; long.
Both the north and south 17&amp;apos; 9&amp;quot; sides contained a 17&amp;apos; 9&amp;quot; X 6&amp;apos; 9&amp;quot;
glass panel. The south wall is an outside wall. The cage is planted
with a variety of shrubs, has a small, constantly flowing, stream of
water running through it and is thermostatically maintained at a
minimum temperature of J0 0 -J2* F.
No special behavior was noticed between the two birds until the
last week of February, 1959, when the male began courting the female.
In the first week of March copulation was observed and repeated
mating took place during the next several days, in each case on a
plant branch. The female was seen carrying nesting material to
several sites in the habitat cage during the second week of March.
The pair was isolated as the Yuhinas destroyed the initial nesting
attempts and it was feared other birds might also interfere.
Therefore, on March 14, both birds were removed to another glass-
fronted exhibit. This exhibit measures 4&amp;apos; 8&amp;quot; X 4&amp;apos; 3&amp;quot; at the bottom
and 4&amp;apos; 4&amp;quot; x 3&amp;apos; 4&amp;quot; at the top. The height from the top of this cage
to the bottom, is 8&amp;apos; 4&amp;quot;. All walls of the cage are solid except for the
lower 6&amp;apos; of the 8&amp;apos; 4&amp;quot; wall on the viewers-side which is a glass panel.
No copulation was observed from this time onward.
A culture of fruit-flies was established and maintained on over-ripe
fruit in this exhibit, as a food supplement, in addition to the formula
that was available to the birds at all times.

104 R - T - REUTHER-BREEDING OF THE STREAMER-TAILED HUMMINGBIRD
Various types of plants such as Grape Ivy ( Vitis coignetiae ), Citrus
(&amp;apos;Citrus limonia) , Begonia (Argenteu-guttata) , Bougainvillia ( Bougain-
villae glabra ) and Diffenbachia (sp.) were placed in the exhibit to provide
perching and possible nesting sites. Fine strands of hemp-string,
Spanish-moss and cotton-wool were supplied as nesting material. On
March 15, the female was observed carrying strands of hemp-string
to a crotch on one of the plants. She did this for the next two days
and then started to build in another location. On March 22nd, she
utilized a third location. The structures she assembled in each case
appeared flimsy and unsatisfactory, so an artificial nest of clay and
strands of fine hemp-string was fashioned by hand and placed in the
location of her choice of March 22nd. The point of attachment of
a branch to the main trunk of the begonia plant was the nest site.
She seemed to accept this artificial nest without hesitation and started
adding to and shaping it to her satisfaction. The male never was
observed to aid in nest construction.
On March 24, the female was observed on the nest at 6.30 A.M.
At 8.00 A.M. she was off the nest and one pure white egg was
observed in the nest. During the day she was seen carrying more
nesting material to the nest. The male kept interrupting her work
by pursuing her around the cage. She would have nothing to do
with him and kept retreating to other perches every time he came
near.
On March 27, the female was found, apparently in difficulty, on
the floor of the cage at 6.30 A.M. She acted as if she were egg-bound.
She was picked up, fed by dipping her bill in the food solution, placed
on a perch in her cage, and at 7.30 A.M. she was back on the nest.
At 8.00 A.M. she left the nest and a second egg was in the nest. On
close inspection, this second egg was seen to be malformed, being
extremely blunt at one end. The female sat on the nest for short
periods of not longer than 1 o minutes, the rest of the day. The male
still pursued her every time she left the nest. She was away from the
nest for as long as one hour and fifteen minutes.
On March 29, believing the presence of the male Hummingbird in
incubation and rearing young was not required and indeed, possibly
hazardous to successful hatching and rearing, we removed the male
to a separate cage.
On March 31, the malformed egg was found broken in the nest.
The female continued incubating the remaining egg for the next ten
days. During this period, she was observed off the nest for intervals
as long as one hour.
On April 8, the branch of the begonia plant, to which the nest
was attached, fell off, spilling the nest and the remaining egg on the
floor of the exhibit, breaking the egg. This egg contained an
apparently well-formed live embryo.

R. T. REUTHER-BREEDING OF THE STREAMER-TAILED HUMMINGBIRD IO 5
On April io, the male was again placed in the exhibit containing
the female. On this date, the begonia plant in the cage was replaced
by a California privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium) and several other plants
were replaced.
During the next two weeks the male was again observed copulating
with the female. During the last week in April, the female repeated
the procedure of carrying nesting material to various locations. An
artificial nest, of the same material described earlier, was on April 22nd
again placed in a location on the privet plant, which was the third
site chosen by the female. The nest was, this time, wired on the stem
of the plant so that it could not fall.
On April 30, at 8.30 A.M., the female was off the nest and one
egg was observed in the nest. On May 2nd, at 7.00 A.M., the female
was off the nest and the second egg was seen. Both eggs appeared
normal. The hen did not start regular incubation until after the
second egg was laid.
On May 3, the male was removed. On June 23, he died of unknown
causes.
In both nestings the female always incubated in the same position,
facing the glass, and thus, the public. This was the position that
afforded her head region the most light.
On May 18, at 8.20 A.M., the female left the nest briefly and it
was observed that one chick had hatched. It had not hatched before
6.30 A.M. when the two unhatched eggs were last seen. After returning
to the nest, the hen again left the nest at 9.30 A.M. and at that time,
there was still just the one young bird. At 10.30 A.M. the female
again left to feed and the second chick was observed half-out of the
shell. At 12 noon both chicks had hatched and the female had
cleared the nest of egg shell.
The incubation period thus observed, was 16 days.
On June 3, at 2.00 P.M., one young was found dead in the nest.
It appeared well when seen earlier that morning. The dead chick
appeared to have been in good condition. A few breaks in the skin
were noticed which appeared fresh and some blood on the left wing
was noted. While the cause of death is unknown, it is felt that the
artificial nest remained too rigid and small and thus, the two growing
birds were overcrowded. The dead chick weighed, within hours
after death, 34 grains. On June 6, the remaining young bird was
first seen exercising its wings while perched on the inner lip of the
nest. This was done generally after each feeding by the hen. The
hen's usual routine was to feed from the formula bottles and then
gather fruit flies before feeding the chick by regurgitation.
On June 12th, the surviving young hovered, about 2 inches, above
the nest for two minutes before it fell back into the nest. It did not
leave the nest again that day or the next. On June 14, between

9.30 A.M. and 10.00 A.M., this bird flew from the nest, never
returning and perched on a nearby twig.
On June 15, at 9.30 A.M., the young hummer was first seen drinking
from a bottle feeder itself. However, the mother still fed the chick
regularly and often. She was still feeding the chick on June 30.
Thinking that the chick should be feeding itself, without the help of
its parent, a bottle feeder was placed close to its favorite perch and
it immediately fed. The following day, the hen continually agitated
the chick and would not let it feed, thus, we removed the hen from
the exhibit on that day and placed her in a separate cage by herself.
On July 3, the female laid another egg on the floor of the cage.
This egg could not have been fertile as the male had been removed
May 3. The same day, July 3, she was put into the large hummingbird
habitat exhibit where the whole episode originated. There is one male
Streamer-tail with her, thus, we again have a pair and possibilities
of a repeat performance.
All of our hummingbirds and sunbirds are regularly fed the
following formula which has been the practice for several years.

23 February, 1959, in the San Diego Zoological Gardens. This is
the first bird of this species to be successfully hatched and reared in
the western hemisphere.
A search of the literature reveals only one questionable record else-
where in the world in the last hundred years. In " Records of Parrots
Bred in Captivity", Part II (cockatoos and macaws), Arthur A.
Prestwich, 1951, gives the following account : " This entry is made
with considerable reservation. At the 9th June, 1854, meeting of
La Societe Zoologique d'Acclimation, M. Pucheran gave a brief
account of a visit to San Donato, Italy, the menagerie established by
Prince Demidoff. He had been very impressed by several breeding
events that had taken place among the mammals and birds during the
two previous years. After noticing the successes with the mammals he
says : ' Among the birds were two Kakatoes nasiques ', (Bull., 1854,
230). It is not quite clear whether these birds had been bred or were
merely inmates of the menagerie, but I believe the former is intended."
This unusual cockatoo is found in eastern, southern, and north-
eastern Australia. The general color is white, tinged with sulphur-
yellow, especially on the under surface of the tail. Base of the feathers
on the head, neck, throat and around the breast is pink. Base of the
forehead and a large patch in front of the eyes are red. Bill is whitish
horn in color. Upper mandible is very long and slender. Eyes are
dark in color. Total length is 17--18 inches.
Also known as the " Corella " in Australia, the Slender-billed
Cockatoo feeds almost exclusively on a small yam which it digs with
its long bill. Roots, bulbs, and tubers form its staple diet. Such a
vast amount of digging must wear the upper mandible very rapidly,
but this is compensated for by the rapidity of its growth. Although it
has a grotesque appearance, this species is well known for its gentle
disposition and talking ability.
Our breeding pair of Slender-billed Cockatoos were imported from
Sydney, Australia, in 1951, through the generosity of Sir Edward

Hallstrom, President of the Taronga Zoological Park Trust. The
breeding pair are eight years old.
A single egg was laid 22 January, 1959, in a wooden box, twelve feet
from the floor of the cage. Wood shavings and soil were equally mixed
for nesting material. Twenty-nine days later a chick was hatched.
Only the hen bird incubated the egg.
Every trick in the book was used to induce this pair of birds to nest
in captivity--different nesting facilities, nutrition, care and manage-
ment all were important factors leading to the event.
The diet in captivity includes sunflower seed, whole corn, wheat,
apple, carrots, sweet potatoes, bread, lettuce, corn-on-the-cob, pinion
nuts and peanuts. All were readily eaten daily. This diet was
supplemented with garden snails, mealworms, and cuttlefish bone to
stimulate egg laying.
Though still plentiful in some parts of its range, in many districts
the " Corella 55 has become scarce because of the introduction of sheep
and cattle diminishing its natural food supply. The activities of
trappers, and destruction by farmers when flocks of Slender-bills raid
newly planted grain fields, reduces the population of this species in
its native land. Before the " Corella 55 was placed on the list of
protected birds, Sydney bird shops were crowded with young birds
of this species. Thousands of nests were robbed in order to meet the
demand for young " Corellas 55 as pets.

There appear to be as many methods of feeding flamingos in
captivity as there are flamingo keepers, but every aviculturist attempts
to provide the basic dietary essentials : protein, fat, carbohydrate,
vitamins and minerals, plus one or more ingredients calculated to
provide a source of pigment to color his birds 5 feathers. We have
learned, through pale pink experience, that the flamingo is unable
to synthesize its own " flamingo 55 red unaided. Some recent experi-
ments at the New York Zoological Park have resulted in the adoption
of a new ration which has produced very brightly colored birds and
aroused the admiration and interest of visiting bird enthusiasts.
The flamingo's feeding apparatus consists of a thick, muscular
tongue set within a channel-like beak, both tongue and beak lined
with strong, comb-like filaments. These specializations, augmented
by the powerful pumping actions of the tongue, contrive to give

flamingos a superb food strainer which enables them to secure the
minute animal and vegetable life contained in the dense waters and
mud of lake and lagoon bottom, thus tapping an incredibly rich
source of food probably available to no other higher vertebrate. The
efficiency of this food-gathering mechanism may explain the sub-
sistence of the incredibly dense transient populations of Greater
(Phoenicopterus antiquorum) and Lesser Flamingos ( Phoeniconaias minor)
on some surprisingly small east African lakes. In captivity, a satisfac-
tory substitute food must be of such a consistency that the flamingos
may employ their super-strainers, and be palatable enough to attract
their interest. This means that a food may be mixed that is soupy
and mud-like in texture, but which must also meet flamingo nutritional
requirements, be practical to prepare, easy to feed and reasonably
economical. Besides all this, it must contain some substance or
substances to keep the birds in good color. In recent years, zoos have
shown varying degrees of success meeting these requirements, and a
great variety of sources have been employed to provide the color
element of their diets.
At present there seems to be little agreement on the exact nature
of the pigments normally found in flamingo feathers or the importance
of the roles of those colors which have been identified. For some time
a carotenoid called astaxanthin was considered the primary red pig-
ment, at least in the plumage of the American Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus
ruber). More recently, doubt has been cast upon this assertion and,
for the present, we must be satisfied with the more general statement
that some sort of carotenoid pigment extracted from the natural diet
is normally used by flamingos to color their skin and feathers red or
pink. Volker (J. Orn. 99 : 209-217) has recently suggested that
yellow carotenoids present in the food may be transformed into the
red carotenoids present in the feathers. It appears that flamingo
color biochemistry is rather more flexible than we would at first have
suspected. In any event, from avicultural experience, we know that
red pepper, carrots, lobster, shrimp and crab carapace all carry
carotenoid pigments that will produce some color in flamingos. Until
recently, our ration contained most of these ingredients and our birds
were pink. However, we were not satisfied with either the birds'
color or the logistics of the ration, and, like all flamingo keepers, we
found ourselves constantly looking for a way in which to improve
the color of the flock.
Despite the greater or lesser degrees of success which zoos using
vegetable sources of carotenoid to color their flamingos had reported,
we were plagued by reports from certain color biochemists whose
work seemed to indicate that a really deep flamingo red, such as ruber
assumes in the wild, was dependent upon carotenoids like astaxanthin,
which may only be derived from the animal segment of the bird's

diet. As a zoo source, shrimp was the most loudly touted of these
animal carotenoid sources, but those of us who have used shrimp
found that although the fresh product produced better results than
the dried meal, it presented a severe economic and spoilage problem,
for fresh shrimp is expensive and, when ground, has few peers in the
race to deterioration in the hot sun of a flamingo enclosure. Besides,
in our experience, the quantities of shrimp we were able to provide
did not produce deep flamingo color. The evidence from zoos using
red pepper or carrots for coloring their birds militated against accepting
the necessity of animal carotenoids, and to further convince us,
investigations of the food habits of the Lesser Flamingo and the high
Andean flamingos, including Phoenicopterus chilensis, Phoenicoparrus
andinus, and Phoenicoparrus jamesi, all indicated that algae, probably
rich in vegetable carotenoids, formed a major portion of the natural
diets of these species. Indeed, it even appeared that some of these
birds had no other major source of carotenoids. Thus, vegetable
carotenoids seemed a reasonable source to check for a flamingo
coloring agent, but we were beginning to realize that a simple additive
was not the entire answer.
Breeders of red-factor canaries have long known that certain food
items have an adverse effect upon the red coloring of their birds even
though the administration of " color food " is held constant. The
commercial poultry industry has conducted research on a mammoth
scale to gain control of the skin and flesh color of the chickens and
the yolk color of the eggs it markets. Now, for example, the poultry
farmer may cater to the New York taste for a light yolk or the mid-
west taste for a more strongly colored egg yolk by varying the
ingredients of the diet he feeds his birds. Investigation has demon-
strated that some common poultry feedstuff&amp;apos;s such as soybean oil meal,
meat scrap, fish meal and fish oils contain a factor or factors which
inhibit the deposition of yellow pigments in the beaks and legs of
growing chickens. On the other hand, chickens fed the dye Sudan III
or lobster shell, carrying astaxanthin, will lay eggs with bright red
yolks ! While no one can say whether flamingo coloring will react
in red-factor canary or broiler fashion, these facts formed interesting
background upon which to base an experimental flamingo ration.
To form the nutritional basis of a new flamingo menu we chose
an " open-formula," commercially available, poultry " Super Laying
Mash," which is low in feedstuff&amp;apos;s that might detract from the deposi-
tion of carotenoid pigments in skin or feathers. The search for an
economical and nutritionally satisfactory source of concentrated
carotenoids ended with the discovery of a product with the euphonious
title, " 180 D Super Caradee." As a vitamin supplement it provides
250,000 U.S.P. units of Vitamin A per pound. It seemed a sure source
for associated carotenoid pigment. It is a carrot oil concentrate in an

alfalfa leaf meal carrier supplemented with " D 55 Vitamins, produced
by Nutritional Research Associates, South Whitley, Indiana. To
Caradee, which comprises i o % of the ration, and the Laying Mash,
which makes up 55 % of the food, we added raw ground carrots,
par-boiled ground horse meat and bone meal to complete a ration
that is easy to prepare, economically feasible and reluctant to spoil.
Bird feathers are essentially dead structures once they have reached
their normal size, and, contrary to the expressed belief of many
aviculturists, they change only very slowly through deterioration or
wear so that special measures taken to improve feather color after
a flamingo has molted to a pale pink will have no effect until the
next molt, which may be many months away. While Heinroth has
noted that Cattle Egret plumes do change color from white to yellowish,
perhaps in a deteriorative fashion as the result of special light reactive
chemical structure, it has not yet been demonstrated that any species
may change the colors of its feathers as the result of diet after the
feathers have attained their full growth and before the next molt.
Processes of osmosis are sometimes referred to, but they have not
been demonstrated. We have watched our flamingos and several
other species very carefully with this argument in mind, and can
state that the only birds which showed feather color change were
those in which new feathers had grown some time following the
introduction of the new diet. In any event, we were unwilling to
wait the better part of a year to find out whether our new ration
was producing the desired effect in the flamingo flock, and after the
birds had been eating the food for approximately one month, we
chose two pale experimental birds and pulled a large, square patch
of feathers from the right wing of each. In the ensuing weeks, the
flamingos, especially the test birds, were not only observed daily, but
visited by hopeful keepers and curator so frequently that it seemed
almost impolite to be unable to raise scapulars and honk the proper
greeting notes as a member of the flock. During the fifth week of
the experiment, the birds that had been plucked were again captured.
We were wonderfully rewarded by the sight of two pale pink birds,
each with a bright rose red patch on its right wing ! Since this
experiment took place eighteen months ago, our birds have completed
a major molt and their newly deepened color causes constant comment.
As a check of the normality of the new hue, we took the precaution
of purchasing two freshly captured adults in full wild color. These
birds blended perfectly with our flock and gave a direct comparison
which satisfied us that not only was the color of our birds satisfactorily
deep, but also of the proper hue. Three forms are exhibited in our
enclosure, and, thus far, all seem to respond well to the new food.
The species exhibited are Phoenicopterus ruber , Phoenicopterus antiquorum ,
and Phoenicopterus chilensis. But, one word of caution, our P. chilensis

THE BREEDING OF THE OLIVE-BACKED
THRUSH
Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni (Tschudi)
By Charles Everitt (South Norwood, London, England)
</figure>
<bodyText confidence="0.99918134375" page_id="56317511"  page_num="112" year="" vol="">
In the early part of 1957 I obtained a pair of North American
Thrushes. They were not newly imported having been accepted by
the person from whom I got them in exchange for some other birds.
I was told they were Hermit Thrushes but I was not at all happy about
this identification for they did not resemble closely enough any illustra-
tions I had seen of Hermits, even taking into account the loss and
distortion of colouring that often takes place during the process of
reproduction in print. However, pending making any further enquiries
I released them into a flight measuring fourteen feet, by three feet, by
six feet high. Eight feet of the flight was actually inside a birdroom
with an outside extension of six feet. Previously there had been a pair
of Zebra Doves in the flight for which I had fitted up two nesting-trays,
one in the inside flight and the other outside. Both trays were fitted
about nine inches from the top of the flights and in the corner farthest
away from the entrance doors.
Within four days the thrushes had constructed themselves a nest on
the inside nesting-tray. These trays measure about eight inches by six
inches, with an inch-and-a-half rim all round. The hen bird did most
of the building using pieces of hay and dried grasses that they had both
collected from the outside flight. It was a circular open nest about six
inches across at the top, the sides rising some three inches. Four eggs were
duly laid, the hen sitting constantly from the time of laying the second
egg. They were of a sky-blue colour, heavily flecked in sepia-brown
at the broad end and they measured 16 mm. by 22 mm. All hatched on
the fourteenth day from the laying of the first egg, the female having
done all the incubating, but, despite an ample supply of live food
always being available in the inside flight, the parent birds deserted
the chicks after four days and they all died. There was no attempt at
further nesting that season as both birds went into a heavy moult.
I was not unduly perturbed, although not a trifle disappointed, for
I felt it was rather a lot to expect birds to settle down so quickly
and rear a family.

When the moult was completed I decided to ascertain for a certainty
exactly what species of thrush they were. With the co-operation
of the Natural History Museum, my wife examined endless numbers
of skins and books of reference leading to the final conclusion that they
were Olive-backed Thrushes Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni which was
further borne out by the fact that their song had an upward trend
whereas, according to the books, all other species of thrush sing in a
descending cadence.
In 1958 they went to nest in late May using the same site, but this
time they lined their nest with mud. Again four eggs were laid and
hatched out. Every conceivable form of live food obtainable was
provided--all placed in the inside flight--but after only two days the
chicks were deserted and the food left untouched. As in the previous
year the parent birds went into a moult immediately and so ended
another unsuccessful attempt.
This year, 1959, it seemed that they were not going to nest at all
for, although the male bird was in full song, they showed no interest in
each other. However, on 9th June, we saw the hen busily making a
nest of dried grass and rootlets she had gathered from the outside flight.
She had chosen the same nesting tray and this time my wife provided
a supply of mud in the form of "John Innes Compost " well soaked.
With the combined use of natural dried grasses--growing grass which
had dried up in the flight as opposed to hay--and the " super "
quality mud, a really beautiful nest was the result. The first egg was
laid on 1 ith June, the full clutch of four being completed by the 14th.
I felt that drastic action was called for this time so, since I had seen
the male bird driving the hen every time she left the nest for a moment,
I decided to remove him just prior to the eggs being due to hatch.
This I duly did on the 24th, and put him out of sight in another bird
room. I say out of sight, for to have removed him out of hearing would
have necessitated taking him right out of the neighbourhood since his
song, sweet as it is, is very penetrating.
The first chick arrived late on the 25th, and the nest of four were
all out by the following morning. Again an abundance of live food
was placed in the inside flight but, as I had noticed the parent bird
scratching about in the outside flight, I tossed some gentles into her.
She immediately gathered them up in her beak--about eight at a
time--and flew inside and fed the babies. Henceforth we ensured the
outside flight was always well stocked with live food, although there
was plenty inside as well. As there is a Russian Vine growing over the
aviary it was necessary to throw the live food on top of this and as
it fell through like solid rain--or manna from Heaven maybe to her--
she darted around gathering it up.
I must say that at times I was very tempted to return the male
bird to the flight for I feared that the rearing of four ever-hungry

mouths might prove too much for her on her own. During the brief
periods we were able to watch them she appeared to make a habit of
feeding them every twenty minutes or so. After discussing the matter,
we decided to take a chance for she seemed so happy and content with
her chicks and the calling of the male bird had no apparent disturbing
effect on her. It was just at this stage that a heat wave really began to
make itself felt within the birdroom and it was interesting to note the
way in which she ceased to brood them, but just perched on the side
of the nest clear of their bodies.
The youngsters continued to thrive and on the eleventh day it was
intriguing to watch the manner in which she was attempting to entice
them out of the nest. She would fly in from the outside flight with a
mealworm across her beak and take up a position on a branch about
nine inches away from the nest. Here she would call to them and
then turn and fly out again. Her efforts were finally rewarded by one
of them venturing forth and making the branch with a combined hop
and flap of its little wings. The branch was slightly below the level of
the nest. However, that was the only one that came out that day and
since it fell to the floor when attempting to make the return trip, my
wife picked it up and replaced it in the nest. It was about a five feet
drop to the floor, but as this was covered with thick peat no harm
was done.
The following day, i.e. 7th July, all four chicks were out of the nest
and had taken up positions on some low branches in the flight. It was
now possible to study the chicks closely for, after the experiences of
previous years, we had not attempted to go too near to them up to
then. Their general colouring was dark brown above with a collar of
dark fleckings and the under parts a clear buff. Their tails were prac-
tically nonexistent at this stage, giving them the appearance of little
balls of feathers on legs as they hopped around the flight.
The rapid change that took place in their plumage after leaving the
nest was amazing for, within 48 hours, the collar of fleckings had
extended until it completely covered up the upper portion of their breasts
and the under parts had changed from clear to mottled. In fact it was
now almost a counterpart of the parent bird's general colouring even
to the 44 V " shaped clear patch running from the base of the lower
mandible down the throat, except that the underparts were a greyish
buff as against the clear buff of the adult birds. By the morning of the
9th July one of them had ventured out into the outside flight which
necessitated passing through an entrance hole of 9 in. by 6 in. situated
about 3 ft. above ground level. By the evening two of them were regu-
larly making the trip to and fro.
During the limited time we had really to observe them we had seen
no signs of their starting to forage for themselves. Whilst they were
outside the mother bird used to scratch around at the ground but, up

to now they did not attempt to copy her. They were very tame and
would accept mealworms from my wife's fingers.
That same evening, that is when the chicks were fourteen days old,
and had been out of the nest for three days, the mother bird was spending
all her spare time reconstructing the nest. In fact she appeared to be
at it all the time and we were a little anxious as to whether she would
desert the chicks or not. However, as soon as we tossed fresh live food
in for her she was down and fed them until they all adopted a bleary-
eyed, well-content expression.
It was obvious that she was eager to go to nest again, but we did not
feel inclined to take the risk of re-introducing the male bird until such
time as the chicks were independent and away. We felt that four
live youngsters, plus a clear round of eggs maybe, was by far the more
attractive proposition.
By the fifth day out of the nest she was feeding them soft food
as well as live food and my wife saw her feeding them soaked currants--
one of our regular ingredients of the soft food mixture. Two were
much in advance of the others and had now started to come out into the
outside flight as evening drew on, just as the parent birds always did.
The first time this occurred we were a little perturbed about it, won-
dering if they would go back at nightfall. Our fears were totally
unwarranted, however, for the mother bird called them both in when
she apparently felt they had had enough. All four of them readily
took mealworms from my wife's fingers by now, and on the sixth day
we saw them actually picking gentles out of the dish in the inside flight.
By the 14th July, that is 8 days out of the nest, they were all picking
up for themselves, although still prepared to accept anything from
their mother and, furthermore, there were two eggs in the newly made
nest. One of the youngsters appeared to spend all its time carefully
sitting on these with no objection by the mother bird. Whether this is
a case of mothering instincts coming out at such an early age remains
to be seen, for it is difficult enough to sex the older birds without trying
to differentiate between them in their baby plumage. The only thing
is that they evinced no interest whatever in the old nest once they had
vacated it and now only one of the chicks was interested in the new
nest and its contents. Further, this particular one seemed to have
slightly darker feathering than the other three. Maybe it will turn out
to be a hen.
By the time they had been out of the nest a month they, and the
mother bird, had all gone into a moult and it will be necessary to wait
until this is completed before it will be possible to make any attempt to
sex them. The mother bird only laid the two eggs this time and it was
from one of these that I was able to obtain the measurements quoted
earlier. Up to this time every egg laid had been hatched, but now I
do possess two complete eggs.

with the youngsters.
As described above, Charles Everitt has bred the Olive-backed
Thrush Hylocichla ustulata swainsoni. It is believed that this may be
a first success.

By J. P. Newell (Athlone, Eire)
When importing some birds from Holland in 1957 I was offered
both Peruvian Doves and Pygmy Doves. Being curious as to what
exactly were Pygmy Doves, I ordered a pair, and found that they are
small doves about six inches long.
The cock's body colour is light grey, slightly darker on back and
wings, and with a light purple bloom on the breast. The outer flight
feathers are black, visible even when the wing is folded, tail short,
grey on upper surface but black on the underparts. The flanks and
underparts of the wings are tangerine, only to be seen when the bird
is in flight or arches its wings. Scattered royal blue isolated spots
and patches are displayed on the wing-coverts. The hen is similar
though slightly smaller, and of a browner colour. The voice is a
monosyllabic coo, repeated at one-second intervals, eight or nine
times.
In the course of my search to identify the exact species of these
doves, I have found that reliable literature on foreign doves is scarce.
Audubon's " Birds of America", plate 182, Ground Dove ( Colum -
bigallina passerino), illustrates a brown and a grey dove, which are exactly
similar to my pair, except that the brown bird is of a far deeper
brown than is mine. Audubon states that " the brown bird is the
cock, the grey bird being the hen, length about six and a half inches,
underwings reddish, eggs two, on the ground or in bushes, and the
bird is found in California, etc."
My pair are extremely nervous little birds, so much so that the hen
seems to be incapable of movement for some time after being handled.
They have to themselves, an outdoor aviary 6 X 6 X 2J feet wide,
half of which is shelter, which contains bushes and various types of
nest-box.

J. P. NEWELL-AMERICAN GROUND DOVE ? I I 7
In the course of their three unsuccessful breeding attempts, I learned
that " the breeding season is January and/or June ", that the young
make no sound at any time, either when being fed or calling for food.
The courting display consists of one bird taking the other's complete
beak into its own, just as in the feeding of young doves. Both heads
are then rapidly pumped up and down eight or nine times. That the
grey bird is the cock, being larger, more masterful, and " drives the
hen " in the typical dove fashion. That the eggs are two in number,
white, oval, and shiny. That the nest is composed of short pieces of
dry grass placed in a flat open nest-tray, and that partly fledged
youngsters are very dark in colour. The most important thing
I learned, however, is that inspection of the nest is absolutely fatal
to successful breeding, resulting in desertion of the eggs or young,
followed by the cock fighting the hen, as if to drive her back to the
nest, so necessitating his temporary removal from that aviary.
Last January, when the pair were incubating for some weeks, the
cock started to attack the hen, and judging that the youngsters were
no longer alive, I entered the aviary to remove him. I was surprised
to see a single healthy, partly fledged youngster in the nest, and so
hurriedly withdrew. The result of my entering the aviary was as
expected, the birds deserted the youngster and so ended another
breeding attempt.
During the second week of May, 1959, I saw the cock collecting
pieces of short dry grass, and judged that the hen was about to lay.
On 1 st June a hasty glance showed that the cock was roosting alone,
so that the hen was then brooding eggs. On nth June, I saw the
broken egg shells deposited in the flight and knew that the youngsters
had emerged--probably on that morning. On 28th June the cock
made occasional attacks on the hen, causing her to retire behind
a clump of brushwood that I had placed high up in the shelter, for
just this purpose. On the following day, these attacks increased in
frequency, so that I feared that the hen would not be able to feed,
and that, once again the cock would have to be removed. I wondered if
it would be possible to hand-rear the youngsters, as I had no other
breeding doves on which to farm them out.
On my entering the shelter, two well fledged youngsters darted
out of the nest and on to the perches, so I retired to consider my
next move. While doing so I noticed that the cock attacked the hen
if she came near the youngsters, so I this time removed the hen and
awaited developments. Shortly afterwards the cock led both youngsters
back to the nest, and stayed with them there, so I decided to leave
the youngsters to him. Within a few days they were following him
from perch to perch, but at no time have they yet made any vocal
sound. They have been self-supporting now for over a week and
have been transferred to a separate small aviary.

The youngsters are of a very light brown colour, one slightly
browner than the other. They have the reddish under-wings and
flanks, also the dark undersurface of short tail, similar to their parents.
When running, the tail is turned up at an angle just like that of
the wren, but is straight with the body when the birds are perched.
The crown of the head and the lower back are marked by narrow
dark brown bars, similar to those on the head of a young Budgie.
The edges of the wing-covert feathers are white giving very pretty semi-
circular white markings on the brown body colour, contrasting with
narrow horizontal white lines set in the flight-feathers. The outer
flight-feathers are black as in the parents and the royal blue spots
on the wing-coverts are also present.
From examination of a flight-feather, I find that the colour of the
webbing on one side of the midrib is grey, while on the opposite
side of the midrib the colour is reddish, thus giving the grey outer
colour and red inner colour to the wings.
I would be glad if I could get some information re what species
of Ground Dove these birds are.
The two youngsters have been placed in an adjoining compartment
of the aviary, and have been independent now for some time. Both
are fit and well, but still browner in colour than the parents. I notice
that one is inclined to occasionally bully the other--this is a trait of
the parents.
When taking away the youngsters from the cock, I introduced the
hen, and the pair nested again. I noticed a single broken egg shell on
the morning of 30th July, 1959, and presumed that only one egg had
hatched. I saw another broken shell on 3rd August, 1959, and wondered
what the result would be. From then onwards both birds incubated
steadily, and during the brooding the cock was kept busy, driving
away the first pair of youngsters when they perched beside the
dividing wire netting. This served to distract him from his usual
bullying of the hen.
On the evening of 11 th August, I saw that a small but well-
feathered young dove had fallen from the nest, and when replacing
it, a larger young dove darted out of the nest. Later that night
I saw the two youngsters and parents were roosting together on one
of the perches.
On the morning of 12 th August, the smaller bird again fell from
its perch, and was not sufficiently fledged to be able to fly back,
so I replaced it on the perch, and later I found that both youngsters
had been lured back to the nest.
One youngster is definitely more developed than the other, which
would account for the difference in dates of my finding the empty
shells. But the first shell being found on 30th July, 1959 and the other
on 3rd August, would make the youngsters to date 14 days and 11 days

old respectively, and the youngsters must be older than that. True
they are small, but they are feathered. There is no question of my
not seeing the shells for some time after their being thrown out of
the nest, as they are always deposited in the outer corner of the
flight, and I was watching for them, in order to find out date of
hatching--it is all very puzzling.
Owing to the cock's determination to keep the first youngsters away
from his aviary, he used to fly at them even when I was standing quite
near, and this has made him tamer. It also probably accounts for
the fact that my replacing the fallen youngster did not cause desertion,
as was formerly the case. To date, I find that the youngsters perch
with the parents at night, but return to the nest tray during the day,
and though small, still I think that they will be successfully reared.

Bred by David Dale and written and illustrated by John Perry.
(Pinelands, Nr. Cape Town, S. Africa)
The January/February, 1957 issue of the Avicultural Magazine
gives a very interesting and good account of the breeding of Agapornis
pullaria by Mr. A. A. Prestwich, of Southgate, England. The article
is accompanied by an extremely good coloured plate of this fascinating
lovebird painted by Mr. D. M. Reid-Henry.
This present article is a follow-up in recording a second success
with this difficult species in South Africa. During 1956 I was fortunate
in obtaining a pair of these birds from a friend who in turn had obtained
them from a sailor on a visiting ship. It is probably not known in
England that the importation of foreign birds into South Africa is
a very difficult and costly process.
However, I was extremely anxious to try breeding from this pair
and having consulted several ornithological treatises on the subject,
came to the conclusion that the provision of a nesting site similar
to that used by the birds in a natural state would lead to success.
The pair was liberated in an aviary approximately 24 ft. long by 12 ft.
wide by 7 ft. high in company with a mixed collection of seed-eaters
and waxbills.
Here in Cape Town most aviculturists provide live food for their
birds, when breeding, by supplying a termite which builds mounds of
black earth. These are common in parts of the Peninsula and prove
an effective means of supplying the necessary feeding material during
the breeding season.
It was with the information gained from Cave and Macdonald's

Agapornis pullaria.
" Birds of the Sudan 5 5 that I decided to use several of these termites'
nests fixed strategically in the aviary as possible nesting sites. At first
the pair took no notice whatsoever of these ant-hills but, after about
a fortnight, I noticed that a certain amount of burrowing had been
undertaken. The burrowing went on until eventually the pair suc-
ceeded in making a tunnel right through the ant mound ! This happened
in each case and owing to the fact that the weather was rather dry and
warm (it being November) the nests soon crumbled and disintegrated
altogether.
I was about to try again when by force of circumstance I was com-
pelled to remove my aviary and to dispose of my birds. In January,
1958, my neighbour, David Dale, took this pair over and liberated
them in an aviary some 30 ft. by 12 ft. by 10 ft. high with a shelter
12 ft. by 6 ft. by 10 ft. at the southern end, and containing a mixed
collection of finches and waxbills and including some Barbary Doves.
Knowing of my failure in the use of ants' nests he decided to experiment
with cork cubes. Two separate pieces of cork measuring 12 in. by 10 in.

planking on five sides and hung up in the aviary at the north end,
completely in the open. Nothing happened until March, when it was
noticed that the female was busy excavating into the cork slab. This
went on for a few days until a deep tunnel had been made and the hen
eventually disappeared altogether. My friend was very perturbed
when the hen disappeared completely for about four weeks. He felt
sure she must have died in the nest so he broke the golden avicultural
rule by taking down the nest box and peering cautiously inside. To
his amazement the hen shot out and to his dismay discovered two
young unfledged in the nest both dead !
It should be noted that the year 1958 proved to be exceptionally
dry for the Gape Province. In fact we enjoyed a long period of warm,
sunny days almost throughout the winter, so the nest-box remained
dry and unaffected by moisture.
Incidentally, the nest in this instance consisted of a tunnel which ran
right through the cork until the wooden back of the box was reached
and then turned to one side where a small oval chamber was constructed
as shown in illustration A.
This year Mr. Dale made another attempt by placing an entirely
new cork nest site in a similar position and of the same external

construction. In early February the pair settled down again to
burrowing and formed an opening approximately i\ in. in diameter.
This extended, as before, right through the cork to the back of the
covering box. This time, however, the tunnel rose vertically and
over towards the front where the breeding chamber was constructed
as indicated in sketch 4 4 B Another interesting feature of their
behaviour this time was the fact that the hen did not hide away in
her nest as previously, but was seen to leave the nest twice a day to be
fed by the cock. The male was also noticed carrying to the nest small
pieces of the leaves of a creeper (commonly known as the Morning
Glory) under its mantle.
By the first week in March it was fairly certain that breeding
operations had commenced in earnest. At the beginning of April
the hen left the nest more frequently and stayed out for longer periods.
She also commenced feeding herself. Both male and female paid
regular visits to the nest and both slept in the nest at night. On 30th
May the first young bird, fully fledged, left the nest although no sound
of young had been heard. This youngster was strong in flight and had a
somewhat deeper green body-colour than the parents. The head was
orange and the bill pale orange tipped with black. On 3rd June a
second baby left the nest, this specimen having a deep red head
with traces of black on the under-wing, so it is fairly certain that it is
a male. I should mention at this stage that this year we have experienced
one of the wettest periods for years, so that the nest was exposed to a

continuous downpour for days on end. Mr. Dale fully expected the
young to be drowned in the nest. On 6th June a third chick left the
nest and on nth June a fourth. It was thought that this must be
the full nest of young, but to Mr. Dale's great surprise a fifth baby has
now appeared (14th June) and is being fed by the parents at the
nest entrance.
The birds were fed on a seed mixture consisting of yellow manna,
Japanese manna, Canary seed and golden millet. Sunflower seed was
also readily available. It appears also that the parent birds fed the
young on the leaves of the Morning Glory creeper.
I believe that this is the first record of breeding the Red-faced
Lovebird in South Africa, so I think Mr. Dale is to be congratulated
on his achievement.
P.S. --6th July. All five young ones are in excellent condition and
are now fending for themselves.

DWARF MACAWS

The Dwarf Macaws appear to have been largely ignored by
aviculturists, quite possibly because they are not generally available
and are not a brightly coloured group. Their failure, if it be, for
lacking bright colours is possibly more than made up by their quaint
habits, their more congenial size, and generally winning ways.
Here in California the Severe appears to be the most commonly seen,
and even these are by no means common and usually command at
least twice the price of the larger macaws, such as the Blue and Gold
for example. The Illiger's would appear to be the second in availability,
and here again they are definitely not common.
The Spix, fabled and long sought after, does not appear in any of
the Californian collections, public or private, known to the writer.
This is to be regretted because apparently they are among the most
desirable of the small macaws, as well as the most striking in coloration.
Two rare Dwarf Macaws now in the writer's collection are a female
Red-bellied and a male Coulon's Macaw. The latter does not appear
to have been mentioned by Tavistock, Seth-Smith, or in any of the
past issues of the Avicultural Magazine with which the writer is
familiar. However, this species is described in the Catalogue of the Birds
in the British Museum , Volume XX. Incidentally it is difficult in the ex-
treme to see how couloni could be considered a subspecies of the Illiger's.
Years ago I had a pair of Illiger's and they are as vastly different from
the Coulon's as an Elegant is from a Rosella. The Red-bellied is men-
tioned by Tavistock and appears to have been imported into England.
It is of some interest to know that these two birds appear to be
rather fond of each other, and while in Mr. Roland Muller's collection

at Santee they were observed mating. As macaws appear rather
prone to hybridizing it is possible that these will eventually reproduce.
Their diet is no problem, and they are very happy with the usual
seeds and grains, plenty of fruit, a few peanuts and pine nuts, and an
occasional piece of stale bread. They are surprisingly fond of the
ribs of Swiss Chard, and prefer it to any other form of green food.
Lastly, mention should be made of the fact that the Red-bellied
is, or certainly must be, the closest psittacine relative to the Anseri-
formes. Rarely have I seen a bird more fond of a bath . . . two or even
three times a day the female is seen having a dip, somewhat to the
male's disgust . . . who apparently is inclined to think that the
Saturday night tubbing is quite sufficient for any bird !

As a result of representations made by the Hon. Secretary of the
Avicultural Society, Mr A. A. Prestwich, and a member of Council,
Mr E. N. T. Vane, the ban on the import of Parrots is being
partially relaxed. The following letter has been received from the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Animal Health Division,
dated 25th August 1959
"You will recall that several years ago a meeting was held at the
Ministry to discuss the possibility of a relaxation of the ban on
imported parrots and other psittacine birds. In view of your interest
in the matter you may like to know that it is now proposed to proceed
with the making of an Order which would permit an owner to bring
into Great Britain not more than two birds provided they travel with
him ; such birds must not within three months of importation be
kept on premises on which there are poultry. Importation may also
be authorised by licence granted, subject to conditions, by the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Secretary of State for Scotland
if the birds are required for research, exhibition in a zoo or permanent
scientific collection, breeding when an imported bird is specially
required, or as pets. Under the proposed new Order no birds may
within three months of importation be kept on any premises which
are pet shops."
Members of the Avicultural Society have reason to be grateful to
Mr Prestwich and Mr Vane for this very satisfactory result of their
efforts, which has been achieved after a number of years. It is to be
hoped that every effort will be made to prevent any abuse of this
concession and any member of the Society who may learn of any
contravention of the Order should, in the interests of his fellow
aviculturists, report the matter at once to the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food.

By William C. Dilger (Laboratory of Ornithology and Department
of Conservation, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, U.S.A.)
During the winter of 1957-58 a large planted outdoor flight,
measuring 16 feet by 22 feet on the plan and 8 feet high, was occupied
by an adult male Blackbird, Turdus merula ; three Fieldfares, T. pilaris ;
an adult female American Robin, T. migratorius ; and an adult
female Song Thrush, T. musicus. In addition, there were several
Chipping Sparrows, Spizella passerina, and Redpolls, Carduelis flammea.
The Blackbird and Fieldfares were hand-raised and sent to us in
1957 through the kindness of Dr. Hans Lohrl of Ludwigsburg,
Germany. The Robin was hand-raised by us at the same time.
These birds were all maintained on our standard insectivorous bird
mixture consisting of equal parts by volume of turkey starter mash,
dog-meal, and dried insects. This mixture is moistened with enough
cottonseed oil to render it crumbly but not wet. They also received
apples and live insects from time to time.
The Blackbird began singing a subsong by March 15 and about
two weeks later was in full song. Early in April he began to display
to the female Robin. He was very aggressive towards her and several
times I considered removing her from the flight. When he wasn't
engaged in singing advertising songs or displaying in other ways he
would engage in frequent supplanting attacks upon her ; sometimes
catching her and pecking at her around the nape.
During his precopulatory displays he would hold his head high,
mouth open, crest raised, rump feathers ruffled, tail depressed tightly
against the substrate (causing the feathers to curve downward), wings
slightly drooped ; and would then walk about with short, rapid steps
whilst uttering a high-pitched, querulous squealing sound. This seems
to agree essentially with the description of a display mentioned in
Witherby (1949) and elsewhere. After a few seconds of this the Robin
would usually fly or hop to him and he would then attempt copulation
with her. The Robin, however, never was seen to solicit copulation
but would immediately flee when he made intention movements to
mount. This led to rapid, erratic chases all about the flight until he
either caught her or desisted for some other reason. When he would
catch her he would hold her, with his bill, by the nape or crown while
attempting to forcibly copulate. Some of these " rapes " must have

been successful as will be seen from subsequent events. These activities
began shortly before she began to build a nest and persisted throughout
egg-laying, but ceased when she began to incubate. However, the
Blackbird remained constantly aggressive toward the Robin and
supplanting attacks never ceased although they became relatively
rare during incubation (when she was mostly unavailable) and
increased somewhat when she was feeding her young (since she was
again more often active in the flight).
She began building her nest on the 25th of April and completed it
three days later. She utilized a simple wooden shelf placed about
six feet from the ground and within the sheltered portion of the flight.
The nest was a typical Robin's nest with a twiggy base, a mud cup,
and lined with fine grasses. The male often made supplanting attacks
on her while she was gathering nest material or when she was building.
In every case she would drop what material she had in her mouth and
flee. She never attempted to go back and pick up such dropped
material but would begin gathering all over again ; even if the material
dropped into the nest cup.
The first egg was laid early on the morning of April 29th ; the day
after the nest was completed. She laid an egg every morning for the
next two days but the morning the fourth egg was due the nest
platform fell down and all the eggs broke and the nest destroyed.
I replaced the platform and building resumed on the morning of
May 4th. Two days later the nest was again complete and the same
day she laid the first egg of her second clutch. The clutch of four eggs
was completed on the morning of May 9th.
On the 19th of May I candled all of the eggs and found that only
one was obviously fertile. The fertile egg pipped on the 25th day of
May and hatched early the next morning. The female began feeding
it tiny earthworms gleaned from the flight that same afternoon. The
male was never seen to take the slightest interest in the nest or its
contents. She fed the young progressively larger earthworms ; partly
supplied by us and partly gathered from the flight. She also utilized
both fresh and newly thawed gentles which we supplied from time to
time. On June 5th, when the young was eleven days old, it fled from
the nest when I went to examine it. I replaced it in the nest where it
remained overnight, but the next morning it left again. For the next
two days it sat on or near the ground in dense vegetation and
periodically clamored for food. The third day it began to follow the
female about when hungry.
As soon as the young had left the nest, the female began building
another nest. She, like many birds, built only in the morning and
would stop this activity around noon. Whenever the young one
followed her about while she was gathering nest material she would
always eventually turn around and thrust whatever she had in her

mouth into the waiting mouth of the young one. I would then have
to go into the flight and extract, with the aid of forceps, the mass of
bents, rootlets, mud, etc., and feed it a few earthworms. During the
afternoons, when she was not nest building, she would feed her young
quite normally. She also was not seen to feed her young nest material
when it was not following her about during the first two days after
fledging. At this time she fed it perfectly normally--even during the
mornings she was building. The male was never seen to approach the
fledgling. Many male thrushes take over the job of feeding fledged
young while the female is building anew. I finally wearied of extracting
nesting material from the mouth of this fledgling and brought it
indoors and raised it by hand. The accompanying photograph shows
this young hybrid when 16 days old.
The female began to lay again on the 9th of June and finished her
clutch of four eggs on the 13th. I candled these eggs on the 16th of June
and again found that one was fertile and the others clear. On the
29th of June I removed the eggs and found that the fertile egg contained
a well developed but dead embryo. The female had incubated faithfully
so that the failure to hatch was not evidently caused by the effects of
cooling.
The Blackbird essentially ignored the Song Thrush present in the
flight but persecuted the Fieldfares unmercifully. They were trying
to nest and were prevented from doing so by the aggressiveness of the
Blackbird. I finally removed them to another flight. The Chipping
Sparrows and Redpolls were not molested nor did they molest the
thrushes.
The natal down of the hybrid thrush was a peculiar tannish gray ;
not at all like the almost white down of young Robins but apparently
more like that of young Blackbirds. The mouth lining was deep
yellow and the mouth flanges were considerably paler, almost cream
colored.
The juvenal plumage, at first glance, resembled that of young
Robins and several people seeing this bird did not suspect its mixed
origin. However, when placed side by side with young Robins of the
same age it appeared to be quite different. It was a uniform deep
brown above, including the head. Below, it had a deeper and more
extensive reddish brown color than have young Robins and the white
area of the belly was more restricted. The whitish areas about the
eyes and throat so conspicuous in Robins, was much reduced in the
hybrid and not pure white but slightly tinged with brownish. There
were no white areas in the tail. Young Robins of our eastern sub-
species (T. m. migratorius) have white at the tips of the outer tail
feathers. Young Robins are quite grey above and their heads are
blackish. The pale spots on the back are almost white in young
Robins and were a very pale tan in the hybrid.

W. G. DILGER-NOTES ON A HYBRID THRUSH
This hybrid is still alive and well and, of course, in its first winter
plumage. This closely resembles the juvenal plumage except that the
pale spots above and the dark spots below are gone. It is still a brown-
backed Robin with a noticeable reduction of white below and around
the eyes.
The up-down tail movements, so extreme in the Blackbird and much
less so in the Robin, are evidently intermediate in the hybrid. We have
recorded its voice from the time it was a fledgling, but have not analysed
and compared this information with homologous vocalizations of the
Blackbird and Robin ; both of which sound very similar in many
respects.
I believe that this hybrid is a female, as I would have expected more
melanin in the plumage of the male. Its present brown dorsum is about
the same color as the dorsum of female Blackbirds and the heads of
both male Robins and male Blackbirds are largely black.
The first day out of the nest the hybrid was seen to sharply raise
its hind end immediately after being fed by its mother. She bent down
as if to seize the forthcoming fecal material (as she had done so many
times before in the nest) but let it fall to the ground instead, regarded
it for a moment, and flew off. She was never seen to take any interest
in the fecal matter again. Like all young thrushes, this bird would
waggle its tail rapidly from side to side, back up, raise its rump, and
then defecate. On June 16th it was still behaving in this manner.
On the 17th of June the backing up component was missing and the
following day the tail-wagging also ceased. On this day it bathed for
the first time although it had bath water available for several days
previously. However, on June nth it performed bathing movements
(but not drying movements) after I had sponged some soiled feathers
around its face and upper breast.
It began pecking at objects on the 9th of June but did not pick up
food and eat until the 19th, when it was twenty-five days old. It still
required hand-feeding, however, until the 29th.
On June 6th it was sleeping with the head turned back over one
shoulder, usually the left, but still occasionally slept with the head
merely tilted upward. By June 9th it always slept in the adult fashion.
A search of the avicultural literature and of Gray's book (1958) has
revealed no evidence for any previous occurrence of this hybrid.
I have concluded, therefore, that this is probably the first time such a
bird has been produced.
On May 9th, 1957 I placed an adult female Song Thrush in an
unplanted outdoor flight with a plan measurement of 5 feet by 16 feet
and 8 feet high. The basal 5 feet of this flight is sheltered on both sides
and the top. A number of Chipping Sparrows and Juncos, Junco
hyemalis, were also present. The Song Thrush was a wild-caught adult
purchased from a New York dealer.

On May 27th I introduced a male wild-caught American Robin
which had been captured the previous autumn and had become quite
tame. From the very first there was much aggression directed at the
Song Thrush by the Robin. The latter was clearly dominant but not
dangerously so and also was in full song.
On June 5th the Song Thrush began attempting to build a nest on
the narrow flange of a steel " L " beam which was part of the aviary
frame. Her attempts were unsuccessful because the material kept
falling off onto the ground. She utilized small twigs, bents, and bark
strips. She finally abandoned all attempts on the 9th.
On June 10th I placed both the Song Thrush and the Robin in the
large planted flight mentioned above. I also provided a simple
wooden nesting platform which was hung about 6 feet high in the
sheltered part of the flight. On June 14th she began building again
and had reached the mud-cup stage by noon of the same day. She
used much more wet peat fragments mixed with mud than did the
female Robin, which used plain mud. The nest was completed the
following day and her first egg was laid the next morning. This egg,
oddly enough, was unspotted and was practically indistinguishable
from a Robin's egg. Four more eggs were laid ; one each day until
the entire clutch of five was completed. The last four eggs were typical
spotted Song Thrush eggs. She sat on the nest a great deal of the time
even when not laying. Serious incubation appeared to commence the
day after the last egg was laid.
Whenever she left the nest to feed, drink, bathe, etc., the male
would fly up to the nest and sit on the edge until she returned. He
frequently peered in at the contents, but never was seen to enter.
He usually left as she flew back toward the nest so that they were
seldom at the nest together.
The Robin's precopulatory displays were most intense during the
nest-building and the egg-laying stage. When the female was perched
he would approach her by pivoting on the perch as he hopped closer
and closer. This type of approach appeared very much like the one
Morris (1954) described for the Zebra Finch, Poephila guttata , and
which appears to be common in many other species. The female
would usually retreat from these advances and a swift chase would
result. These would sometimes end in attempted rapes. Like the
female Robin, this bird was never seen to solicit copulation. On the
ground the male would approach the female by a series of rather slow
hops with frequent pauses. During the pauses his tail would rapidly
raise and lower a few times with emphasis on the upstroke. His crest
was always at least moderately raised and his wings slightly drooped.
Once a display resembling that described above for the Blackbird
was seen. It differed in not having the head raised nor the mouth
opened. The tail was depressed, however, and the wings slightly

drooped. The feathers of the rump were not ruffled but were slightly
fluffed. It looked very much like a lower intensity version of the
Blackbird&amp;apos;s usual display. The Robin also ran about with quick little
stiff mechanical steps as did the Blackbird. On this occasion the
female did not approach him, however, but flew off instead and was
chased by the Robin. A pivoting type approach was never seen when
the birds were on the ground.
I had never seen the exaggerated Spread posture, so common in
agonistic situations with the Wood Thrush, Hylocichla mustelina , given
by any species of Turdus. American Robins, in similar situations, just
fluff out the ventral plumage slightly and raise the crest (Dilger,
1956 a and b). However, on one occasion, I had just placed a handful
of mealworms in a dish in the flight which were immediately pounced
upon by the Song Thrush ; whereupon the male Robin ran rapidly
toward her in a Head Forward threat posture. The normally sub-
servient Song Thrush held her ground instead of fleeing and the Robin
immediately went into an extreme Spread posture such as usually is
employed by Wood Thrushes. The Song Thrush then fled and the
Robin began to feed on the mealworms. It appeared as though the
Spread of the Wood Thrush and the so-called Fluff of the Robin are
homologous, but that the high intensity form merely has a lower
threshold for release in the Wood Thrush than in the Robin. I also
once saw this posture in its extreme form in the female Song Thrush
and several times in the Fieldfares. On these occasions the situations
were similar (an ordinarily less dominant bird temporarily with a
strong tendency to hold its ground while being attacked by a normally
dominant individual--which performed the Spread).
On July 14th I removed the Song Thrush&amp;apos;s eggs and candled them.
All were clear. On July 16th she rebuilt the old nest and lined it with
wet peat into the rim of which she worked many moss fragments and
sprouted seeds. The first egg was laid during the morning of the 18th.
She was off the nest most of that day but returned to sit briefly around
three in the afternoon. She completed a clutch of four eggs on the
morning of the 21st and began to incubate the following morning.
The male, again, was quite attentive when the female was away from
the nest. I removed these eggs on August 14th and all again proved
to be infertile. The eggs of this clutch happened to measure a
millimeter wider than those of the previous clutch.
She made no further attempt to nest although she appeared to be in
fine health. It may be that the male never succeeded in inseminating
her or that there was some serious genetic incompatibility making
fertilization or early development impossible.

By Robert Goodwin (Laboratory of Ornithology, Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York, U.S.A.)
The neotropical genus of finches, Tiaris, contains four species, two
of which are very familiar to aviculturists as the Cuban Finch ( Tiaris
canorci) and the Olive Finch ( Tiaris olivacea). A third species, the
rather uncommon Sooty Grassquit, Tiaris fuliginosa, of Brazil and
Venezuela, has probably never been kept in captivity outside of its
range, while the remaining species, the Black-faced Grassquit, Tiaris
bicolor, although common through most of its range, has rarely been
kept by aviculturists.
The Black-faced Grassquit is distributed through most of the West
Indies, except Cuba, the Isle of Pines and the Cayman Islands, and
through northern Venezuela and parts of Colombia. It inhabits open
country and has become closely associated with the human population,
spreading into areas that have been cleared for agriculture. On many
of the islands it is common about towns and villages.
I am aware of only two records in the literature of this species
having been kept in captivity, but it is probable that there have been
other instances which were never reported, especially within the range
of the bird. Hopkinson (1938), in summarizing Records of Birds Bred
in Captivity published by Witherby in 1926, lists one record (1910) for
the " Dusky Finch, Tiaris bicolor ". He states that the record " can
be taken as certain (at least in the author's opinion), but further
detail is desirable ". Porter (1936) took back to England two pairs
of the Jamaican race, T. bicolor mar chi, hoping that they would breed
the following year. No further report is on record.
In January, 1958, as a result of the kindness of Dr. Juan A. Rivero
of the University of Puerto Rico, we received a shipment of two males

and five females of the Puerto Rican race, T. bicolor omissa. Several
days later, an immature male died of a respiratory infection, but the
others survived the ordeal of mid-winter shipment and after a period
of molting appeared to be in excellent condition.
Rather than take a chance of losing the remaining male, the birds
were kept indoors until July and then they were put in an outdoor
aviary measuring 22 X 16 X 8 feet which contained, among other
species, a pair of Cuban Grassquits, T. canora, and a pair of Yellow-
faced Grassquits, T. olivacea. In spite of the fact that the latter two
species were breeding at this time, there was relatively little inter-
specific hostility. The bicolor spent much time clinging to the wire of
the sides of the aviary and did so even after they were habituated.
It was not a fear reaction. When the aviary was entered and the
birds were approached, they would hide on or near the ground in
the dense vegetation. If chased, they often remained on the ground
and escaped by running along mouse-like through the grass. In
similar situations, T. olivacea usually remained in the shrubs while
T. canora would fly about the upper half of the aviary.
Their food consisted mainly of millet and canary seed which was
supplied regularly. Occasionally, one of the birds would be seen
running a piece of fresh grass through its bill. In the wild state, they
feed on seeds of grasses and other plants. Porter (1930) writes that
they are often seen in the company of Honey Creepers foraging in
flowering trees. This behavior has also been observed in T. olivacea
by Skutch (1954), but he states that this occurs when grass seeds
are scarce.
Towards the end of July, the male bicolor began displaying to the
females, but after a short time he began directing his attentions to one
female in particular. The main display of the male began with a
belabored, arching flight to a perch near the female. This was similar
to the ''moth flight" which Conder (1948) has described in the
Continental Goldfinch, Carduelis c. carduelis, except that the tail was
not raised in flight. Upon landing, he spread his wings laterally and
slightly downward and vibrated them while giving the buzzy, slurred
vocalization which is characteristic of the males of this species. The
tail was also spread. He displayed in this manner for about two
weeks prior to nest-building. As copulation was not observed, it may
have occurred on or near the ground.
Because the aviary was thickly planted, I failed to discover the
nest until it was nearly completed, so I was unable to determine
whether the work is shared by the sexes or whether one of them
does most of the building. The males of our T. olivacea construct the
nests with little or no assistance from the females, while the females
of our T. canora appear to be largely responsible for the building in
that species.

The nest, very similar to that of T. olivacea , was a spherical structure
four inches in diameter and five and one-half inches high with a small
entrance hole in the side and was composed of the stems and leaves
of grasses and weeds without a lining of finer material. It was placed
at a height of two and one-half feet among the outer branches of an
Arrow-wood bush ( Viburnum dentatum) and the thick growth of bind-
weed that covered these branches.
The eggs were white, speckled with light brown and one was
deposited each day for a period of four days. According to the
literature, the usual clutch consists of two or three eggs (Bond, 1943
and 1947). The eggs hatched twelve days after the last egg was laid.
During this time, the sole function of the male seemed to be driving
away strange birds from the immediate vicinity of the nest. He did
not incubate.
Upon hatching, the young were naked as are those of T. olivacea
and T. canora , and they remained so until the juvenal plumage
developed. They were ready to leave the nest twelve days after
hatching. The juvenal plumage resembled that of the female, but
juveniles could be distinguished from the latter by the light color of
the bill, especially at the commissural angle which was white at first,
becoming darker up to the age of three months at which time the
bill could not be distinguished from that of the adult. The young
male which we have at present began to molt into the adult plumage
when four months old.
Although studies of the comparative behavior of the genus are as
yet incomplete, some points might be mentioned. The affinities of
T. bicolor and T. olivacea appear to be rather strong. Both exhibit
similar components in their behavior, e.g. the " head-forward "
threat display is well-developed and similar and wing-quivering has
been incorporated into the sexual displays of the males. The female
has a very passive role in the precopulatory phase of both species.
T. canora , on the other hand, is a very singular member of the
genus, if, indeed, it is a member at all. The " head forward " threat
posture is very poorly developed and appears to have undergone little
or no ritualization. In all cases which I have seen, it was immediately
followed by overt attack. The common threat display is indistinguish-
able from the sexual display as described below and it occurs in both
intra- and interspecific situations. Wing-quivering in this species,
though it may be similarly derived from juvenile begging behavior,
appears in a different context than in the other two species. It is
often seen in the female preceding and/or during courtship feeding.
I have never seen this behavior in the male in any situation, except,
of course, in the juvenile.
In T. canora , a mutual sexual display is present in which the
partners, standing side by side, execute a series of jerky, pumping

movements of the body, accompanied by twittering vocalizations and
a sleeking of the plumage except for the feathers of the yellow " bib "
which are slightly erected. Moreover, it appears to be the female
that commonly instigates these displays by following the male around
and landing on a perch close to him. It is interesting to note here
that the female T. canora does not have as dull a plumage as do the
females of the other two species ; that is, the degree of sexual
dimorphism is not as great in T. canora. This is a condition one
might expect to find in a species where a mutual sexual display has
evolved. T. canora also shows an interesting convergence with the
Estrildidae in the development of the social phenomena of " clumping "
and mutual preening. Further study will probably clarify the taxo-
nomic status of T. canora , but already its present position in the genus
Tiaris seems to be at least questionable.

Professor Carl Naether (Encino, Calif., U.S.A.)
A pair of Galapagos Doves I obtained a year or so ago, apparently
freshly imported, proceeded almost immediately to nest in my aviary
and, I am pleased to report, successfully. The doves nested on a small
wooden platform high up under the roof--a location well hidden from
general view. To make a long story brief and to the point, this pair
raised to independence 3 pairs of youngsters. Then, the unpleasant
fighting habit became manifest, with the female attacking the male
vigorously almost the whole day long. I separated the two for a
time. When I placed them together later on, they hatched another pair
of young, to be sure, but did not raise them to independence ; rather
they let them starve. This fate befell also the next two pairs of youngsters.
Thereafter some of the eggs proved infertile. I forthwith separated the
breeding pair and later disposed of it to another fancier.
My Galapagos Doves fed mostly on various seeds. While they would
not take mealworms or earthworms, they did eat some Longhorn
cheese, cut into small squares and mixed with a little soft food. These
doves would dig (not just forage) in the rather soft soil of the planted
aviary as if they were seeking live grubs and worms, but I never observed
them getting or eating any. Yet they dug holes, throwing the loose soil
about with great abandon. I confess I don't know what they were
after, unless, perchance, it was seeds, which, however, would not be
buried as deep down as the doves were digging. Incidentally, this pair,
very much like the pair I kept quite some years ago, would not tolerate
other doves in the same aviary. Its behaviour thus tending to prove
my point that the species is exceedingly aggressive, and therefore best
kept by itself.
So many Galapagos Doves have been reared in captivity during the
past year or two, as a result of a large importation, that their price
has become quite reasonable, pairs being currently available at $30.00,
whereas shortly after importation, the asking price was $50.00.
I might add that interest in breeding foreign doves is quite strong
in the U.S.A. at this writing. Moreover, there have been importations
of rather rare species, some of them first importations. Thus, Mr. Mel
Strann, an ardent dove fancier, was fortunate in obtaining some
Lemon (Olive) Doves not long ago. To the best of my knowledge,
this is the first time these colourful pigeons have found their way to
California. The exporter listed them as Rameron or Rameroon
Pigeons. Another first importation is the lively Chilean Eared, or
Ground, Dove also in the possession of Mr. Strann. Though brought

in quite a few months ago these restless birds, which are very swift
flyers, have not as yet nested. Finally, I was fortunate to add some
Splendid Pigeons ( Columba speciosa ) to my collection--quite handsome
birds, whose tameness and gentleness make them my favourites.
This species has, so far as I know, not been reared in the U.S.A.
In conclusion, since moving from Sherman Oaks to Encino, where I
had new aviaries built, my doves and my softbills are much more con-
tented since the aviaries are wholly mouse and vermin-proof! Moreover,
they are entirely roofed over, thus preventing cats and other nightly
" visitors 55 from disturbing my birds from above. As a result of these
precautions, I have been fortunate to raise Mountain Witch, Galapagos,
Bartlett's Bleeding Heart, Tambourine, and other species successfully
in this new aviary. The doves have a measure of security, of feeling " at
home " in their new abode, which seems to conduce to their successful
breeding and rearing. One of the principal reasons, in my estimation,
why certain doves (or other birds) will not nest in captivity is simply
that they feel insecure, that no practical attempt has been made by
their keeper to render their captive conditions and surroundings
similar to their natural haunts, as by means of plantings of shrubs, etc.

It is some twenty years since any Tinamou was in the collection,
so the purchase of a pair of the Great Grey (or Great Blue) Tinamou
(Tinamus tao ) is of considerable interest, particularly as this species has
not previously been exhibited at Regent's Park.
Other species new to the collection are a Chinese Pond Heron
(.Ardeola bacchus) presented by Dr. K. C. Searle (who also sent a
Swinhoe's Owlet (. Athene noctua plumipes)) , a Sierra Parrakeet (. Amoro -
psittaca aymara ) received in exchange and a Black-headed Aracari
(. Pteroglossus v. viridis) presented together with a Scallop-necked Pigeon
(&amp;apos; Columba speciosa ), a Purple Sugar Bird and a Yellow-winged Sugar
Bird by Messrs. G. H. and J. R. Newmark.
A young One-wattled Cassowary has been donated by F/Lt. E. A.
Smith, two Southern White-breasted Crakes by Mr. J. J. van den

(Pulsatrixperspicillatus trinitatis ), Spix's Scops Owl (Oius choliba crucigerus)
and the Derbian Kiskadee or Tyrant (. Pitangus sulphuratus derbianus).
A Cock-of-the-Rock ( Rupicola rupicola) has been purchased and a Red
Shining Parrakeet ( Prosopeia tabuensis splendens) deposited.
Two Upland Geese, two Silver Gulls, a Black-headed Gull, a Blue-
faced or Coconut Lorikeet ( Trichoglossus haematod intermedins) , a Green-
winged King Parrakeet, four Crested Pigeons, two Spotted Eagle-
Owls and a Malayan Glossy Starling have been bred in the Gardens,
together with a number of pheasants. The Spotted Eagle-Owl has
been bred once before in this country--by Mr. L. Bonhote in 1901.
So far as I know, the Black-headed Gull has not previously been
bred in the Gardens.
A Gannet chick has been hatched and is now quite large.
E. T. Booth records {Rough Motes , 1881-1887) that he kept Gannets
in the yard of his house at Brighton and in May 1880 a chick was
hatched which lived until July 1881, when it was killed by other
Gannets living in the yard. In the following year a second bird
was bred.
Three eggs have been laid by a Sun Bittern, the second being
incubated for a few days and the third for some twenty-eight days
when the parents presumably gave up and the egg soon vanished.
These birds were received in 1950 and have previously carried pieces
of nesting material, but have not attempted to build. This time no
nest was made, the eggs being laid on the peat moss between the
rocks on the aviary floor. Mr. A. D. Bartlett, then Superintendent
of the Gardens, recorded in the Proceedings of the Society (1866)
that the Sun Bittern was bred here in 1865. Early in May of that
year the birds showed signs of wanting to nest by carrying bits of
stick, roots of grass and other materials about. As they were seen
to try to mix wet dirt with pieces of moss, they were given some mud
and clay which they at once commenced to use. They built on the
top of a ten-foot tree trunk where an old straw nest had been placed
and an egg was laid early in June. Both birds incubated and after
twenty-seven days a chick was hatched. The young bird remained
in the nest, being fed by both parents on small live fish, some insects
and other unspecified foods. It left the nest after twenty-one days
and at two months of age was indistinguishable from the parents.
The pair repaired the nest with mud and clay and reared a second
young one. Bates (A Naturalist on the River Amazon) relates that he
was told by the natives that the Sun Bittern builds in trees and that
the nest, which is made of clay, is beautifully constructed.

Dr. Frederick B. Warford, San Francisco, reports : " A young pair
of Fischer's Lovebirds, one and a half years old, had a clutch of four
eggs, hatching three typical Fischer's and one blue. They are now
about three months old and have grown into fine feathered birds.
The blue was noted at the very first to have a light grey head and
now, although the body is typical blue masked, the head, shoulders,
and breast remain whitish-grey with ever so slight a blend of darker
grey about the position of a Masked but on the cheeks. This pair is
from at least five generations back."

Mrs. Rene Halbaken, Burbank, California, has had some success
in breeding the Greater Indian Hill Mynah. In May, 1957, a pair
nested in an old Cockatiel nest-box : three eggs were laid, two
hatched ; one young one died through a chill at seven weeks, but
the survivor flourished and has this year been mated. The young in
two later nests were allowed to die on about the fourteenth day.
1958, the first clutch of four was laid in March, but heavy rain and
a thunderstorm caused the hen to desert her eggs. Second clutch,
two hatched, one reared ; third, one reared ; fourth, one reared.

When he returned for the last time from the Far East the late
W. J. C. Frost brought a lorikeet which he had bought at a small
port on the west coast of Portuguese Timor. It was a species quite
new to him and remained unidentified until just recently, when
E. N. T. Vane identified it as Trichoglossus haematodusfiavotectus , confined
to Wetar and Roma, islands just to the north of Timor. It appears
to be extremely rare. There is no reference to any previous importa-
tion, no illustration, and no skins in either the British Museum or the
Leyden Museum. This rarity which is somewhat similar to Weber's
Lorikeet in appearance, though larger in size, is at present in the

In 1956 a new filtration system was introduced at the Edinburgh
Zoo's main penguin colony. The resulting clarity of the water induced
the Gentoo Penguins to accept fish thrown into the pool. It would
now seem that this ability to feed freely without assistance from a
keeper has been responsible for almost doubling the number of Gentoos
successfully hatched and reared during 1957 and 1958. The Annual
Report , 1958, of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland deals fully

with this successful experiment and is of sufficient interest to warrant
reproduction.
" In its natural habitats the Gen too lays two eggs but almost
invariably only one young bird is reared, the delay between the hatch-
ings enabling the first chick to assert itself and confiscate all the food
disgorged by both parents. The second chick therefore declines and
dies, its appearance presumably being of a precautionary nature
against infertility of the first egg or of its chick's accidental death
during the early and critical hours.
Able to feed abundantly throughout the day the Gentoo parents of
the Park's colony can now satisfy their second chick when the first
has fed to repletion ; but this being foreign to their natural breeding
habits an unexpected difficulty was encountered. A chick becomes
as big as its parents before ceasing to rely on them for regurgitated
food, and, while the adult birds can cope with the demands of one
lusty offspring, the continuous feeding of clamouring twins caused the
harassed parents to show signs of emaciation. The chicks were there-
fore removed to a nursery by themselves where they were weaned to
hand-feeding by the keepers. This has become the normal procedure
when the chicks are about half-grown, at which time the parent
birds begin to show the first signs of embarrassment, and the system
works perfectly. As against three chicks reared from ten eggs in 1956,
the year before the filtration system was in operation, eight were reared
from ten eggs in 1957, and a further eight from ten eggs in 1958."
The Report also states : " Only three king penguin chicks were
reared from a total of twelve eggs . . . The small ringed penguins did not
nest during 1958, and although two maccaroni penguin chicks were
reared to about half full growth they finally succumbed to mycosis.
With the smaller species the difficulty of obtaining fish small enough
to feed whole to the growing chicks is an ever-present difficulty."

TASMANIAN BIRDS. By Michael Sharland. Angus and Robert-

This is the third edition, extensively revised, of a book first published
in 1945. The binding and print are agreeable and the book is a con-
venient size for a field guide. The first thirteen chapters are devoted
to the major groups of Tasmanian species ; in the fourteenth (almost
a third of the book) the author describes bush and garden birds, a most
useful division and one that cannot fail to help town-dwelling amateur
naturalists. Finally there are two brief sections on species introduced
from Europe and other continents, and on two native species

now extinct. There is a charming coloured frontispiece of the Yellow-
throated Honeyeater and a dozen half-tone plates of other species.
Each description is prefaced by a line of heavy type giving the
bird's most obvious colours and approximate length ; there follows
a rather more detailed account in non-technical language of colour,
nesting habits, eggs, and, when distinctive, the song or call. The
author's own observations are recorded in many interesting field notes
and altogether the book should do much to increase popular interest
in the strange and beautiful birds of Tasmania.
If a further edition should be contemplated it would be useful to
give a generalised diagram showing the various parts of a bird, and
perhaps some line drawings emphasising the distinctive characters
of species that closely resemble one another ; in this case the descrip-
tions might be made more detailed. It might also be useful to give
a brief note on the Royal Albatross since the absence of records of this
species in Tasmanian waters may be due to its having been confused
with the Wandering Albatross.

R. B. Bennett. Gage Birds, London 1959. Price 155. net.
The author has had over forty years of experience in keeping and
breeding British birds and his book, written in a conversational style,
imparts the knowledge he has gained on this subject over this long
period. The first chapter is devoted to British Birds and the Law
in which the 1954 Bird Protection Act is explained and it is made
clear what may legally be done both with regard to obtaining and
selling British birds. He points out that the restrictions on obtaining
wild birds should act as an incentive to breeders to build up good
stocks of captive birds and later in the book states " Selective breeding
in the hands of the enthusiastic and serious breeder will soon reap its
reward and the Act as it now stands will have proved a blessing to
the British bird section, rather than the death-knell expected." He
makes a very good point, when drawing attention to the fact that it is
illegal to sell British birds other than close-ringed specimens bred in
captivity, by stating that to conform with this provision the birds
must be ringed when still in the nest, which may upset the parents
and bring disaster. This is certainly a very difficult problem. There
are chapters on outdoor and indoor aviaries, cage breeding, general
advice on feeding and hand rearing, and the use of foster parents,
as well as on ailments and accidents and show cages ; a standard of
scales of points for shows is also included.
A large section is devoted to descriptions of eighty species of British
birds which contain many of the author's own observations ; it is a
pity, however, that he does not always state whether the species he

MAROON PATCH ON WING OF FEMALE SLATEY-HEADED
PARRAKEET (. PSITTACULA SCHISTICEPS )

<bodyText confidence="0.968118724137931" page_id="56317544"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
Both Smythies in his book " The Birds of Burma " and Tavistock in " Parrots
and Parrot-Like Birds " state that the female of the Slatey-headed Parrakeet
Psittacula schisticeps lacks the maroon patch on the wing ; in fact this is generally
accepted as the difference in the plumage of the sexes. I am inclined to think,
however, that this long-held view may be wrong, and I am strengthened in my
belief by a letter I have had from Mr. J. D. Macdonald, Deputy Keeper of Zoology,
British Museum (Natural History).
We have a couple of Slatey-headed Parrakeets at Keston which we have always
regarded as a pair, since the cock courts and has actually been seen feeding the hen.
Hitherto she has lacked the maroon wing-patches, but has now acquired them after
her recent moult, although the cock continues to treat her in every way as a hen.
I wrote to Mr. Macdonald asking him for any information he could give me
on the subject, and he replied as follows :--
" In reply to your letter of the 25th, nearly all our specimens of Psittacula
schisticeps which are sexed as females have no maroon spot on the wing. However,
there are two which do have this spot, and this shows, if they are correctly sexed,
that at least some females do have this feature. At any rate it does give some
support to your findings."
This interested me very much, but as it seems to me most unlikely that some
adult female Slatey-headed should have the maroon spot on the wing, while others
do not, I should think a far more probable explanation is that the two with maroon
wing-patches are the only two fully adult female specimens they have at the Museum,
the others being younger birds which would be less wary and easier to shoot than
the adults.
Incidentally, in Aviculture Vol. 2, page 444, Delacour and Tavistock writing jointly
say of the Slatey-headed Parrakeet " the sexes are alike ".

JUVENILE PLUMAGE OF MAGPIE-JAYS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998759416666667" page_id="56317544"  page_num="143" year="" vol="">
I read with great interest Mr. J. L. Throp's fine article on collecting in Mexico as I,
too, have made several trips there and came back with nice birds, although I was never
fortunate enough to catch the birds myself. I would like to point out that the white
spots, or splashes, on the Collie Magpie-Jay's black throat are signs of juvenile plumage.
I have had several for many years and the second year the white always disappears.
In Bullock's Magpie-Jays the reverse is true as the young birds have black throats
which turn white when adult, leaving only a black " necklace ". In any case the white
spots or greyish bibs on Collie Magpie-Jays are not a variation of the species.
I have just recently brought back 18 Collie Magpie-Jays and among them are
many with the white or grey blotches on their throats. Collie Magpie-Jays are not
easy to get as their range is restricted to the states of Sinaloa and Nyarit, with only
short overlaps into Duvanga and Jalisco. South from Galina the Bullock's are found.

OUR COCK LUTINO PLUM-HEADED PARRAKEET--AN APPEAL
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995313529411765" page_id="56317545"  page_num="144" year="" vol="">
I am writing this letter in the hope that it may catch the eye of someone who would
be kind enough to sell or lend us a proved adult hen Plum-headed Parrakeet to mate
to our unique and beautiful lutino cock.
This lovely little bird is unique not because he is the only lutino Plum-headed,
but because he is the only known pure lutino, without so much as a single fleck of
green in his plumage ; and such is the interest taken in him that people even in
America and Australia have written to ask us if he has yet been successfully bred from.
The answer has to be No ; but on the other hand he has proved that he is not
sterile : The first " hen " we provided him with proved to be (as is so often the case
with this species) an immature cock. The second one was a true hen and they went
to nest, rearing one young one until it was well feathered, when it died in the nest ;
and shortly afterwards the hen escaped and was killed by a cat while feeding on the
ground in front of the avairy. The third one we obtained for him was a genuine hen,
but so crippled by frostbite--she had no toes, only two stumps left--that it was hardly
surprising that her eggs were clear, although the cock had attempted to mate with her.
The fourth, which certainly looked a hen, has just, after two years, moulted out as a
cock--hence this appeal for a genuine adult hen, before it is too late.

(.Icterus galbuld)
By A. A. Prestwich (Southgate, England)
The Baltimore Hangnest or, as it is commonly known in America,
Baltimore Oriole is the " State Bird " of Maryland.
It breeds from southern Canada and northern United States
nearly to the Gulf of Mexico, and west to the Rocky Mountains :
and winters from southern Mexico to Colombia.
The female is readily distinguished from the male (about 7J inches
in length) by her much smaller size ; greyish-olive on the back ;
wing-feathers with pale or white edges ; front of crown and upper
tail-coverts yellowish-olive ; throat and centre of belly buff; breast
dull orange ; sides, flanks, and tail greyish-olive ; under tail-coverts
orange-yellow ; bill more slender than in male.
The nest is pensile ; both sexes assist in the construction, but the
main task of weaving falls to the female. A large variety of material
is used, plant fibres, nettles, etc., and, if located near human habitation,
string, cotton, horsehair, and sometimes even pieces of rags and paper
are found in the nests. But whatever the material used the nest from
the outside almost invariably appears as grey, occasionally pale straw
coloured and even white. The inside is lined with a great assortment--
fine grass, plant down, tree moss, cattle-hair, fur, cotton, wool,
tow, etc.
The typical Hangnests of the genus Icterus number some forty species,
of which about thirty have from time to time been imported into
Europe (the London Zoo lists fifteen species as having been in the
Collection). They are almost unknown to present-day aviculturists
in Great Britain which is a very great pity as the majority are strikingly
coloured, some sing well, and hand-reared birds become very tame
and can be taught to whistle tunes. They are quite hardy and are not
difficult to feed--an insectivorous mixture, sweet fruit, and a few
mealworms and gentles, suits them well.

Even when available Hangnests do not appear to have been
particularly popular with aviculturists mainly, perhaps, because it was
difficult to obtain pairs, the more colourful males being imported in
preference to the females. A disadvantage, too, is, as Edward Boosey
points out in the case of the Common Hangnest Icterus icterus , " the
lovely brilliant orange in their plumage is inclined to fade to yellow
in confinement."
The only breeding record would seem to be Rowland Hutchinson's
success in New Zealand with the Black-winged Icterus geraudi, in 1933
and 1934, in which years several young ones were reared.

BREEDING TEMMINCK'S TRAGOPAN
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.921996125" page_id="56317563"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
By F. E. B. Johnson (Bletchley, Bucks., England)
The genus Tragopan contains five species (one divided into two sub-
species). All are equally beautiful and full descriptions will be found
in Delacour's Pheasants of the World. Unfortunately, only one species,
Temminck's Tragopan ( Tragopan temmincki), is established in captivity
in the British Isles and this rather precariously.
It seems to me that there are three very important factors in the
breeding of these birds :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.983811" page_id="56317563"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
1. Large aviaries are essential.
2. Correct feeding.
3. Provision of shade.
Taking these points in order :--
1. My aviaries vary in size from 40 ft. X 15 ft. to 50 ft. X 18 ft.,
but I am much happier about the larger than the smaller. There is
no doubt about it, the larger the better.
2. The main meal of the adults (in the morning) consists of one
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.896910545454546" page_id="56317563"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
handful per bird of a proprietary brand of turkey breeders or poultry
breeders pellets. I usually moisten them crumbly soft with skim milk.
" Then why not use mash instead of pellets ? " you will say. The reason
is that I feed all my other pheasants on dry pellets and, therefore, to
buy a sack of mash for the tragopans alone would mean that the food
would be stale before it was all used. Some of my tragopans will
eat the pellets dry and even seem to prefer them that way, but others
will not touch them unless moistened. Few pheasants seem to vary
so much individually in their diet preferences. In the afternoon, the
birds receive a very small quantity of wheat (which has been soaked
for about twelve hours and then rinsed clean) and half an apple per

bird or some other fruit, according to the time of year. They are
particularly fond of elderberries, blackberries, raspberries, currants,
and snowberries ( Symphorycarpus alba) among other fruits. In the spring
and until laying has finished I give them weeds or wild plants of
various species. They seem to prefer the following species but they
must be tender :--
Dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ), Cleavers or Goosegrass ( Galium
aparine), Common Nettle ( Urtica dioica) , Lesser Celandine (. Ranunculus
Jicaria ), Ground Ivy (, Nepeta hederacea ), Sorrel ( Rumex acetosa).
It is best to give a mixed selection of these plants.
The young are not difficult to feed. When newly hatched I offer
them pheasant rearing or turkey starter crumbs on which has been
sprinkled a small amount of yolk of hard boiled egg (this is probably
not necessary, but the bright colour encourages them to eat) and
finely chopped fresh and tender lettuce leaves. They will probably
eat nothing but this last item for the first few days, but this is quite in
order. As they get older they will thrive on the lettuce and proprietary
food alone. I feed the crumbs in a moistened state (using skim milk
to moisten them). After five or six weeks a gradual change is made to
turkey rearing pellets and a little fruit is introduced as well as green
food. Then at four months or so, they may be put on to the adult
diet as above.
3. The ideal way to provide shade is, of course, to plant the aviaries
with ornamental shrubs of various species. These shrubs, however,
take time to grow, but very useful cover can be obtained meanwhile
by using the lopped tops of coniferous trees. These tops can often be
purchased where felling is being carried on. Protection from the sun
is more important to tragopans than shelter from cold as these birds,
like most other pheasants, will roost outside fully exposed to the weather
all the year round. All my birds, however, have a shed which they
can use when they feel inclined.
A word or two on behaviour and management. Tragopans are
usually mated in pairs, but it is possible to mate a cock to more than
one hen. The best way to do this is to place the hens in separate
aviaries and to run the male alternately in each aviary. If two hens
are run together in the same aviary there is a grave danger that the
stronger will kill the weaker or will cause her death by preventing her
from feeding.
The males usually start to display in March, but many will lower
the lappet on occasions all the year round. The full display, however,
is not often seen except at a distance. The male, facing the female,
raises his horns and lowers his lappet to its full extent ; at the same
time he puffs out the feathers of the breast. He then rushes towards
the female with wings held slightly out from the body and at the same
time making a peculiar noise very similar to a small petrol engine

being started. The male also has a lateral display similar to that of
domestic poultry and many other pheasants. He raises one shoulder
and lowers the other to show the hen the maximum amount of side view.
Tragopans usually prefer to lay off the ground and baskets should
be provided, hung high up in bushes. Personally, I find this one of
the greatest difficulties with them ; they will drop a certain number of
eggs from the perch and these eggs are usually damaged and will
not hatch. If one leaves the eggs in the nest the hen will go broody
after laying only one clutch, on the other hand if a dummy or hard
boiled fowl's egg is substituted, the hen tragopan deserts the nest.
It would seem, perhaps, that the only solution is to remove the egg
very carefully and hope for the best, also providing several alternative
nests.
I incubate the eggs under broody fowls or bantams. It is difficult
to say which is the best breed of poultry to use ; it seems to be more
a matter of strain than breed, but I use Black Silkie fowls. However,
I must confess that I have lost a number of chicks each year through
the foster-mothers killing them when they hatch. Broody hens that
do this should be eliminated from the strain. One solution to this
problem as a rule, is to remove the chipped eggs from the hen and
place them in an incubator for hatching. Hens that will kill newly
hatched chicks will frequently take to them quite well when the chicks
are dry.
I use ordinary type pheasant coops and runs for the foster-mothers
and young chicks, transferring both later to movable fold units. In my
opinion, the most satisfactory fold unit is the type consisting of four
wire netting covered " hurdles ". When it is desired to move the
young pheasants to fresh ground, three more hurdles are added to
one side of the existing set and the birds driven through on to the
new ground. Three of the first four hurdles can then be used for the
next move.
Tragopans, although perhaps not quite so easy to keep and breed
as many other species of pheasants, are highly desirable subjects for
aviculture. They quickly become very tame and confiding and few
birds are more beautiful. Every effort should be made to establish
all the species in captivity and thus preserve them for posterity as,
like so many other species of birds and pheasants in particular, their
existence in the wild is severely threatened.

Introduction
I must commence by admitting that, as I have only kept this most
delightful species for about a year, this article will not be anything
more than a very tentative and preliminary sketch of its behaviour.
Nevertheless this will, I hope and think, be of some use as a framework,
however rough and shaky, on which others may build up further
observations. It is particularly desirable that those in this country
who have stocks of these charming birds should endeavour to perpetuate
them in captivity and that those with opportunities for studying this
bird in its wild state should do so. If as a result of reading this article,
some aviculturist endeavours to perpetuate the stock of Blue Waxbills
already in captivity in England or some overseas reader adds to,
confirms, or contradicts my findings by study of wild Blue-breasts it
will not have been written in vain.
The Blue-breasted Waxbill (Uraeginthus angolensis) is also known as
the Blue Waxbill and Cordon Bleu. This is muddling for the British
aviculturist ; since bird dealers in Britain give the latter name only to
Uraeginthus bengalus which is called the Red-cheeked Cordon Bleu in
most books on African birds. These two replace one another in different
parts of Africa south of the Sahara. Some authorities (Delacour, 1943)
consider they are forms of the same species, others (Chapin, 1954)
hold a contrary opinion, as did one of our former members who kept
both species and said that their songs and displays differed (Phillipps,
1903). Since I have not kept the (Red-cheeked) Cordon Bleu, which
would appear from most accounts to be much more delicate and
difficult to keep and breed than is the Blue-breast, I do not feel fully
qualified to offer an opinion as to whether they are conspecific or not.
The Blue-breast is a medium-sized waxbill, of rather slender build.
The male has the face, breast, most of the under-parts and the rump
a delicate, but bright, blue. The tail is darker, greenish-blue and the
upper parts soft brown. The central area of the under-parts is pale
fawn. The female is blue only on face, upper breast and rump,
although some females have a trace of blue on the flanks also. 1
Juveniles resemble the adult female but have no trace of blue on the
flanks ; their bills are nearly all black and shorter and more curved
than the pinkish-grey dark-tipped bills of the adults. These short bills
give the young birds a very chubby-headed, bullfinch-like appearance.
1 I find, on examining skins in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.) that this is true
only of Angolan specimens. Further south and west in Africa most hen Blue-breasts
have a considerable amount of blue on the flanks.

Blue-breasted (upper) and Golden-breasted Waxbill (lower) in typical postures when
on the ground.
Individuals Studied and their Conditions
The birds are housed in a small room about 6 ft. by 6 ft. by 7 ft. high,
which is very well lit by two windows and has electric light. The
windows are covered with lace curtains ; holes were cut in these so
that the birds can get through into the full sun on the windows' edge.
This the Diamond Doves (Geopelia cuneata) kept in the same room
constantly do, but I have never seen the Blue-breasts, or the Golden-
breasted Waxbills (Estrilda subflava) and Avadavats (Amandava omandava)
kept with them, do so. One of the window sashes (the windows face south
and south-east) is open for a depth of eight inches at the top. During
the winter two thicknesses of towelling were tacked over this opening
and a small oil lamp kept burning in the room. This did not keep the
room very warm but, although a lot of cold air got in, the London
smog was largely kept out and the birds appeared to thrive. The
lamp was removed at the end of March and the towelling taken from
across the open part of the window in April. I cut a letter-box sized
"Judas-hole " in the door of the room so that I could sit outside and
watch the birds without alarming them. During the winter months the
electric light in the room was put on each morning at times between
3 and 6 a.m., and left on till 8 a.m., in order to give the birds a " day "
of not less than about 12 hours. In summer the light was put on from
6 till 8 a.m. on five days a week and from 6 till 10 a.m. on Sundays
and Mondays if the weather was dull.

purchased together with four Golden-breasted Waxbills and two
Diamond Doves, from Mr. Trevor Crewes in the autumn of 1958.
Within a week or two the Blue-breasts started nesting, but many
clutches failed to hatch and others that did so did not survive. In
March two more Blue-breasts--a cock and a hen--were obtained.
Early in May one pair hatched young and reared them until about
twelve days old, when they died. Next day their parents, who were
re-nesting, wedged themselves in a crevice the existence of which I
had been unaware) between two window sashes and were dead before
I discovered their plight. The remaining cock of the original four was
then caught and ringed " Double Green 55 and it became possible to
be quite certain which bird I was looking at, since the two hens differed
in colour, one being much darker in both the blue and the brown areas
than the other.
Double Green and his mate " Dark Hen " hatched young in early
June. Unfortunately I had no maggots on hand and although I went
next day into the country and collected supplies of fresh ant pupae
I was too late. The nest contained four young, each dead, with its
crop full of millet. Their mother seemed to take her loss somewhat
more to heart than birds usually do ; at any rate she did not immedi-
ately come into breeding condition again. Her mate did so, however,
and soon succumbed to the advances of " Light Hen " who had for
some time been enamoured of him to the exclusion of the other, as yet
unpaired, cock. Light Hen's tactics did not stop at blandishments
for her beloved. As soon as she realized she was finding favour in his
eyes she attacked his former mate whenever the latter attempted to
approach him. Even months afterwards she had not lost her dislike
of her erstwhile rival and often dashed angrily at her for no apparent
reason and still more often " cursed " her with angry " Tchick-tchick "
notes.
Light Hen and Double Green were soon incubating. They hatched
five young of which one died when nearly fledged, but the other four
were successfully reared. These are two cocks--Red Left and Double
Blue--and two hens--Double Red and Double Yellow--all named,
of course, according to their identification rings. At the time of writing
(25th October, 1959) these four have recently acquired adult plumage
(they were hatched in July) and have beeen showing a good deal of
sexual behaviour for some time. As soon as she heard the begging
calls of these young in the nest, Dark Hen showed great interest and
was constantly trying to get in to feed them. This she did on at least
one occasion but usually when she attempted to do so she was seen and
driven off by their mother. She did not, however, show any interest
in them after they fledged. She appeared to be paired to the Ringless
Cock at this time but they did not nest.

<bodyText confidence="0.984839863636364" page_id="56317569"  page_num="152" year="" vol="">
Double Green and Light Hen went to nest again. This time three
of the five eggs were clear (I suspect the young birds may have inter-
fered with copulation ceremonies and been the cause of this) but two
very fine young ones were reared, which fledged in mid-September.
These were ringed Blue Left and Blue Right and are, I think, a cock
and a hen.
Their mother Light Hen died when these young were only about a
week old. I discovered this when the young were about eight days old,
through seeing Dark Hen twice go into the nest and feed the young
without interferences ; a search soon revealing the dead and decom-
posing body of Light Hen in a concealed corner. Dark Hen continued
to feed, but not to brood, these young. As soon as they fledged she
completely (but only temporarily !) deserted her new mate Ringless
in favour of her first love and the father of her foster-children Double
Green, with whom she soon went to nest. Once incubation commenced
she spent much of her off-duty periods in friendly dalliance with
Ringless. This did not go unperceived or unresented by her mate.
He would not leave his precious eggs in the sacred cause of mono-
gamous morality but as soon as Dark Hen took over incubation he
would often fly straight at Ringless and attack him.
If this were a novel, at anyrate if it were an old-time novel, one would
doubtless record that with the hatching of the young their mother
gave up seeing her boy friend on the quiet and devoted her time to
wifely and parental duties. So indeed she did, but only for about a
week. Then, from having repulsed them, she became more and more
inclined to respond favourably to Ringless' blandishments. As the
young grew their father became ever more concerned with them
and ever less inclined to pick fights, which he was by no means certain
to win, with Ringless. The position at the moment is (time of writing
this, 26th October) that Dark Hen has for all practical purposes
deserted Double Green for Ringless, with whom she is nesting. She
still, however, feeds her young and is occasionally sufficiently gracious
to their father to indulge in mutual preening with him. However we
need spare no tears for Double Green, I think. At the moment he is
really far more enamoured of his young than of his faithless mate ;
and by the time Ringless is busy with paternal cares Double Green
will probably be in condition to turn the tables on him !

on a clean newspaper on the floor. A dish full of live maggots (the
larvae of the bluebottle fly that is sold at most fishing tackle shops), a
little clean bird sand and some crushed baked egg-shells are also always
before the birds. Fresh garden earth with sprouting millet and/or
grass, maw and canary seed is given daily when possible (in winter not

always possible) together with any seeding grasses available, both green
and ripe. Any shoots of garden plants seen to be infested with green-
fly are picked and given to the birds and if I see any large plant that
looks well populated with invertebrate life I pull it up or pluck it and
put in their room for the birds to search over.
Once a week I give the birds seed treated with halibut oil. About
four or five good drops to a couple of handfuls of millet, well rubbed
in. I remove all other seed at first light before giving this and carefully
clear up any of the oiled seed left either that evening (in summer) or
first thing (before the birds have had a chance to feed) next morning.
Having read some frightening accounts of the allegedly evil effects of
fish oils on young birds' metabolism, I discontinued the oiled seeds
during the rearing of the first brood. The young after fledging seemed
rather listless and one was weak on its legs. For a week there was no
improvement. I then gave some oil-treated seed and within twenty-
four hours all four young were as sleek and lively as one could have
wished. That the diet and not any maturation was responsible was
shown by the second brood which, reared on a " halibut oil (for the
parents) once weekly regime ", showed no such listlessness on first
fledging as their elder brethren had.
Of the staple seeds the Blue-breasts take mostly millet, though some
canary and, I think, some maw seed is also eaten. They are very keen
on sprouting seeds growing in earth, less so if they have been sprouted
by soaking. They eat the growing tip of grass, millet and other seedlings
and will often eat whole young blades or stems of grass, chewing them
in the bill and then swallowing them down entire. They like to peck
over fresh earth and appear to eat many minute objects they find among
it. They eat both green and ripe seeds of rye and other grasses but are
less fond of the small seeds of various meadow grasses than are the
Zebra Waxbills. They are exceedingly fond of the seeds, in apparently
any stage of greenness or ripeness, of the knot-grass (Polygonum
aviculare ) which is such a favourite food of House Sparrows and feral
pigeons. When knot-grass was first thrown in the Blue-breasts at once
went and ate the seeds of it in a manner that suggested that they had an
innate recognition of such plants. Perhaps some related species grows
in Africa and is largely fed on by them in the wild ? Except when
rearing young they take few maggots, but I think each bird takes one
or two a day at least and that they would not do so well if kept on
vegetable food alone. If through some accident they have been deprived
of maggots for several days they fly at once to the maggot dish when
it is put in. Greenfly and green caterpillars are eagerly taken. Wood-
lice, whiteworms, mealworms (these tried only once), cooked egg,
milk sop and insectile food are ignored. Fresh live ant pupae, ant
larvae and the winged male and queen ants, but not the workers (the

crushed eggshell, as do the Golden-breasted Waxbills and the Avadavats
that are housed with them. Kilpatrick's Pigeon Minerals are given

Some Aspects of Behaviour
Feeding Behaviour
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999518210526316" page_id="56317571"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
The behaviour of my Blue-breasts suggests that the species is
primarily a ground feeder in the wild. Like the firefinches (Harrison,
1956) but unlike the typical waxbills (Kunkel, 1959) it does not hold
down food such as seeding grass or millet heads beneath its foot. When
taking seeds from a seed-head or when trying to disentangle a piece
of grass or other material that it wishes to build with, it will often
seize it in the bill and then take a forceful jump backwards and up-
wards. Maggots are often, and largish caterpillars usually, beaten on
the ground or perch, as well as dealt with by nibbling, biting and
mumbling through the bill. The Avadavat never appears to beat
large insects on the ground in this manner. Birds seeking insects
examine in particular any plants in the room and also any seams or
crevices in woodwork, the walls or the curtains. At such times they
often take quick stabbing pecks at or into the small holes in the lace
curtains, jumping backwards immediately after ; and also often take
sudden upward flights of two or three feet and then drop back to their
original place on the floor or window ledge. Observation in the wild
might show the true significance of these habits which probably are
part of the innate insect-catching behaviour.

Escape Reactions

<bodyText confidence="0.996306428571428" page_id="56317571"  page_num="154" year="" vol="">
The conditions my Blue-breasts are kept under are far from good
for observing this aspect of behaviour. The usual reaction to an alarm,
such as the giving of the Alarm Rattle by one bird or the distress call
of a Diamond Dove, is for the others, if on the floor or window ledge,
to fly quickly up into the branches. Not only do they react to the
distress call of the Diamond Dove (which is quite unlike any call of
the Blue-breast) but they distinguish perfectly whether the dove is
calling in genuine alarm or merely in petulance at some purely domestic
frustration. They take no heed whatsoever in the latter case. Whether
this reacting to a dove's call is due to recognition of the subtle quality
of alarm that pervades all " alarm notes " at high intensity, or to the
birds having learnt in their wild state to respond to the homologous
(and doubtless similar) call of some African dove I cannot, of course,
say.

Kunkel found that any long-tailed birds flying near them elicited
panic in all the estrildines kept by him. My Blue-breasts at first
showed strong fear reactions to the Diamond Doves, taking wing
in fright if the latter flew anywhere near or above them and being
afraid to approach their nests if a dove was within a foot of it.
Gradually, however, this fear waned and within about two months
the Blue-breasts only took wing if a dove suddenly flew very near or
immediately above them, and then showed no signs of serious fear.
They would feed quite calmly within an inch of a feeding dove and
did not show alarm at one near their nest unless it was actually
perching on the nest or right in front of the nest entrance. This is still
the situation between the two species. None of the young Blue-breasts
bred in the room has shown such fear of the doves as their parents
manifested in their first weeks with them.
On three occasions I have seen Double Green " freeze " in a
horizontal posture with head and neck held low and tail somewhat
raised. Once this was done in response to the alarm calls of a Diamond
Dove and/or a crow flying outside (which had caused the dove to
cry out) and twice as a response to my suddenly entering the room.
All three times were when Double Green was just outside the entrance
to his nest with nesting-material in his bill, which latter he continued
to hold for the two or three minutes that he remained motionless.
Presumably " freezing 55 is more easily elicited in the immediate
vicinity of the nest for I have never seen it on any of the other occasions
(about four to ten times daily) when I have entered the room. Doubt-
less in the wild it is a response given to the sight of some dangerous
" hawk 55 on the wing.
The Blue-breasts are much more tame and " sensible " than the
Golden-breasted Waxbills and Avadavats kept with them. But this is
no doubt because the conditions are more compatible with their innate
behaviour patterns, as a bush and tree-haunting species. For a bird
that normally responds to an alarm by flying into the nearest bush it is
obviously less difficult to feel secure on a high branch, while a man
potters about cleaning the floor, than for a species whose instincts urge
it to fly a distance and then drop again into the reeds or grass.
Bill-fencing
Like other estrildines Blue-breasts frequently " fight 55 by pecking
at each others' bills. Usually they appear just to stab with the closed
bill at the bill-tip of the other bird. This sort of fighting is shown
between birds that are fairly evenly matched or, and more particularly,
in a disagreement between mates or other individuals that are normally
" friendly " to each other. Bill-fencing seldom leads to (but sometimes
follows after) more serious fighting ; usually one or both birds will
break off the dispute by hopping or flying away or, and more often,

go over into Mandibulation or Mutual preening (q.v.). Bill-fencing
thus seems to occur when there is already some inhibition of aggressive
tendencies and could be considered either as a substitute for fighting
or as a very harmless form of it.
Mandibulation
A rapid opening and shutting of the mandibles is shown in many
forms of excitement. It seems linked with inhibited (? or sublimated)
aggressive tendencies. It is often shown after Bill-fencing and then
commonly indicates that yet more appeasing behaviour, such as
snuggling up to the other bird or offering the head for preening is
going to follow. It may accompany Nest-calling or the Submissive
Courtship display, and I have seen it performed with great vehemence
in the intervals of " cursing " an enemy with the " tchek 55 notes.
Mutual preening or caressing
Mutual preening, in which one bird preens the head (and much less
often other parts of the body also) of its partner, is widespread in
estrildines (Kunkel, 1959; Moynihan and Hall, 1954; Morris, 1958) as
well as in some other passerines and in pigeons, parrots, some rails and
some corvines. In the Blue Waxbill paired birds preen each other and
their fledged young (less often) and unpaired birds, particularly young
or adolescent birds of the same brood, may also preen each other. I
have seen, on many occasions, an unpaired male Blue-breast preen a
male Golden-breasted Waxbill's head, but never vice versa.
Most observers seem to regard this mutual preening as simply a
piece of friendly social behaviour that has obvious use ; since the areas
preened most are those the bird cannot reach with its own bill. I
think, however, that, as in pigeons (see Goodwin, 1956) the preening
of the partner's head involves sublimated aggressive tendencies on the
part of the preener and of submissiveness on the part of the
preenee. Often, especially where mates are involved, there appears
to be no overt aggression or hostility between the partners ; they show
every sign of gentleness and affection and in one bout of mutual
preening the roles may be frequently changed. At other times, however,
there is clearly overt hostility involved. Then one may see a bird preen
the offered head in the same sort of rough, angry manner which one
sees an ill-tempered woman use when combing an obstreperous child's
hair ; or a bird offer its head to be preened with the same sort of
grudging ill grace as is shown by a still embittered man or woman
permitting themselves to be kissed after a quarrel. A bird may offer its
head for preening, in an obviously appeasing manner, in response to
actual (though seldom to vigorous !) attack, if the attack has been
made by one to whom he or she is sexually attracted. Apparently
similar behaviour would seem to occur in the Spice Finch (Moynihan

and Hall, 1954) and it doubtless does in other estrildines too. In the
few cases I have seen of mutual preening in estrildines where there was
marked physical inequality between the partners ; such as in the case
of a larger species and a smaller one or a healthy individual and a sick
one ; I have only seen the physically stronger bird preening the
weaker. Kunkel, however, records a sick Avadavat preening a (pre-
sumably healthy) Scaly-crowned Weaver.
I observed one piece of behaviour of a male Golden-breasted Wax-
bill that strongly suggested a link between the desire for being preened
and feelings of physical (? and psychological) weakness. During a
period of about a fortnight in the spring of 1958 the two male Gold-
breasts had frequent fights and chases in which one usually came off
worse. Immediately after one of these encounters the loser--but
never the winner--would often seek out the unpaired male Blue-
breasted Waxbill, sidle up alongside it and offer its head to be preened.
When inviting head-preening, or submitting to it with a good grace,
a waxbill erects the head feathers and either lowers its head or tilts
it towards the partner, with the bill usually pointing away from the
other bird. It may, however, and if the other bird has taken the
initiative it usually does, draw the head back or away from its mate,
though still erecting the head feathers if it intends to submit at all.
c# Blue-breasted Waxbill in Wing-fluttering Display.
The Submissive Courtship or Wing-fluttering Display
In this display the bird adopts a horizontal posture, somewhat
raises the feathers on its mantle, offers its lowered head as if for preening
and violently flutters its partly opened wings (see sketch). If, as is
usually the case, the display is performed while perched beside the
bird evoking it, the head is often twisted slightly away from (but
looking up with one eye at) the bird displayed to. Less often the head
may be inclined towards the other bird. The action of the wings
suggests the fluttering movement many passerines (but not the wax-
bills !) make when food-begging or the wing-fluttering of a Willow
Warbler ( Phylloscopus trochilus) mobbing a Cuckoo. The tail is not
quivered and is not usually moved in any particular way, although it
is sometimes twisted away from the bird displayed at. During the

display the performer mandibulates (q.v.) either constantly or very
frequently. Every intergradation may be shown (and by the same
individual within half an hour) between intense versions of the display,
as above described, and very low intensity variants in which there is
no appreciable movement of the wings or erection of the mantle
feathers. In fact all stages between the full display and a simple
offering of the lowered head for preening occur.
This display appears to be an appeasing or submissive form of
courtship. I have seen it constantly, often at very high intensity, given,
in the past two weeks (date of writing 25th October) by the young
male Double Blue to his sister Double Red. Also, at lower intensities
only, from Red Left to Double Yellow and from Ringless to the Dark
Hen. When giving this display the male follows his beloved about,
constantly sidling up to her or, less often, perching just in front of her
and giving this display. The human watcher has an impression (pro-
bably quite well justified) of imploring self-surrender or even self-
abasement. As is the case with some other, and allegedly more
rational, bipeds the lover's humility towards the object of his infatua-
tion seems correlated with an increased intolerance towards less
favoured individuals. Double Blue would frequently break off in the
middle of his submissive displaying to Double Red in order to make a
sudden, and usually unprovoked, attack on one of the other cocks ;
and having thus relieved his feelings return to his fiancee and humble
himself with renewed zeal. With the possible exception of the first
three days in which he was giving this display Double Blue's behaviour
towards Double Red was not always submissive. Often only a few
minutes before or after giving the Wing-fluttering Display (but never
immediately after) he would approach her in the self-assertive Tail-
twist posture and sometimes bestow a domineering peck as he did so.
The Tail-twist Posture
In this the bird adopts an upright posture with crown feathers
sleeked so as to give its head a very triangular appearance (see sketch)
and as it hops up to the object eliciting the display it twists 1 its tail
towards it. In a particularly vigorous version the displaying bird may
bump into its partner and deliver a peck (which gives the impression
of being a symbolic and " punch-pulled " peck) at its head. Some-
times, especially if both are on the ground, the displaying bird may hop
around the other in this posture as do the Orange-cheeked and Red-
eared Waxbills (Kunkel, 1959). Often the bird displayed to will reply
in kind. Whether it does or not mutual bill-fencing and mandibulating
often follow.
1 I mean the entire tail is held at an angle with the body, not, of course, that the
actual tail feathers are twisted.

Both sexes use this display frequently, but males perhaps rather
more often than females. It is usually given towards the bird's mate or
to some individual in whom it is showing obvious sexual interest. The
bird giving this display appears to be in a bold and self-assertive
mood and it may, as Kunkel says is the case in the typical waxbills,
be motivated by conflict between sexual and aggressive tendencies.
The sexual elements would appear to predominate. If given towards
another of the same sex the Tail-twisting Display may " spark off"
a brief fight between the two. I have not, however, seen it used, as
Kunkel says it is by the typical waxbills, to drive away strange females
from the nest-site.

<bodyText confidence="0.999243142857143" page_id="56317576"  page_num="159" year="" vol="">
This is very similar to that of the Common and Bar-breasted
Firefinches (Harrison, 1956) and the Red-eared Waxbill (Kunkel,
1959). The male seizes a piece of potential nesting material, preferably
a long stem of grass, and perches in front of or, and more usually,
alongside the hen. He then, with feathers of head sleeked down, those
of the flanks somewhat puffed out (see sketch) and his blue tail twisted
towards the female, bounces up and down with an alternate straighten-
ing and lengthening of the legs. He sings and holds his stem during
the display. The display may culminate in an attempt at copulation,
but much more often it does not and if it does the female is not (or at
least was not on the occasions I observed) fully co-operative. Although
this display as given by adults is usually very stereotyped all sorts of
abortive and amateurish-looking low-intensity versions of it were
given by the adolescent males Double Blue, Blue Left and Red Left.

Copulation
The males may attempt to copulate after giving the Stem Display
without any obvious solicitation by the hen, but this seems unusual.
Successful copulations are most often initiated by the female. She
solicits by assuming a horizontal posture with tail somewhat raised and
quivering her tail. The extent to which the tail is raised and the
vehemence with which it is quivered vary according to the intensity
of the display. It is greatest if the female is very eager and her mate
indifferent. The male responds by approaching his mate. They then
often fence bills (q.v.) for a moment, then the male pecks at the female's
head and nape, briefly at her back and then repeatedly and vigorously
at her rump and cloacal region. He then mounts and copulates in the
usual manner with fluttering wings but taking rather longer about it
than most passerine birds do. Probably, however, this is the usual
time for estrildines since the male Avadavat is almost as long. The
pecking of the female's rump and cloaca looks quite savage but I
suspect that the male " pulls his punches At all events the female
does not appear hurt and responds to the pecks with more intense
soliciting and consequent fuller exposure of her cloaca to the male.
This is very different to what obtains in the House Sparrow where
cloaca-pecking is not directly linked with copulation and is intensely
feared by the female who responds to it with fierce attempts to defend

herself or frantic flights to escape. That there is an element of domi-
nance involved in the sexual pecking of Blue-breasts is, however,
suggested by the fact that I once saw the young female Double Red
peck at the male Double Blue's rump and cloacal regions while he was
giving the Submissive Courtship display to her.
When I only had adult birds in the room I never saw Blue-breasts
interfere with copulating pairs, in great contrast to the behaviour of
the Gold-breasts. Every attempted copulation of either pair of Gold-
breasts that I witnessed was frustrated by the other cock attacking the
mounted male. In recent weeks (since mid-September), however, I
have noticed that on most occasions when a Blue-breast Waxbill
started to give the Stem Display some or all of the young Blue-breasts
in the room would show great interest and fly to the displaying bird.
They did not attack, or show any signs of anger, but their crowding
close around always caused the female being displayed to, to move or
the male to stop displaying. I twice saw similar behaviour by these
young birds as a response to the pre-copulating pecking of a female by
a male. On the other hand two attempted copulations, without any
of the " normal " pre-copulatory behaviour, on the part of one of the
young males (Blue Left) were not interfered with. This behaviour
seems very similar to that shown by Spice Finches (Moynihan and
Hall, 1954) towards a displaying male.
Nest-calling
This is indulged in by both sexes. The bird finds some potential
nest-site among the branches or elsewhere and gives the begging note
(q.v.) whilst making head movements that I at first thought to be
intention-movements of building, but which may be adult versions of
the head movements used by begging juveniles. Unfortunately the
nest-calling bird is usually partly obscured by twigs, or inside a basket,
so it is difficult to be certain on this point. Once nest construction
has started the bird often appears to actually build while nest-calling,
but the difficulty of a clear view of what is happening is then accentu-
ated. The function appears to be to attract the mate's attention to a

of the nesting material is found and carried to the nest site by the cock.
I have only seen a hen carrying grass on one or two occasions and
although both sexes take feathers to line the nest, even here the cock
is more zealous than the hen, or so it has been with the few birds I
have studied. As with many other estrildines the birds always hold
the grass or feather by its rigid end if at all possible. So held long grass
stems trail beneath the bird without impeding its flight, which is no
doubt the reason for this habit. Unlike most passerines, which cease
work on the nest as soon as an egg is laid, the Blue-breast continues to
carry in feathers for the lining not only during incubation but through-
out the rearing period, even to within a day or two of the fledging of
the young. The same is true of the Avadavat.
I have not timed the incubation periods of my Blue-breasts. By day
the sexes seem to spend about the same amount of time incubating,
but at night the female incubates alone. I have never seen the male
feed the hen either on the nest or off it and in spite of a graphic but
uncircumstantial account of the cock Blue-breast's alleged solicitude
in this matter, that has appeared in print, I do not think that it
occurs in this any more than in other estrildines.

cautiously into the nest-entrance before so-doing. The function of this
would seem to be the protection of the adult, either from a snake or
some other enemy that might have got into the nest in its absence,
or from being surprised whilst inside the nest from some enemy that
might be lurking near. However, this is mere speculation and what is
needed is study of the species in the wild to elucidate such points of
its behaviour.
Although my Blue Waxbills are not very tame they usually sit very
tight (so do the Avadavats which are much less tame than the Blue-
breasts). Shining a torch into the nest, or even tapping or gently
shaking it seldom induces the parent to leave. If, however, a finger or
pencil is inserted the adult at once flees, even though to do so it has to
scramble past or over the intruding object. One would have thought
this would, in a wild state, result in its being caught by the predator
and would rather expect some fearsome " threat display " as a last
resource, such as the hissing and/or " exploding 55 of the Great Tit
(.Parus major) and many other birds (see Sibley, 1955). Possibly, how-
ever, the " sitting tight " of my captive Blue-breasts is an artifact of
captivity that has reference specifically to myself. Certainly, whereas
(whatever bird-ringers may say to the contrary) wild birds, of various
species, commonly desert if they are " trapped in the nest 55 by a
human, my Blue-breasts return again to the nest within a few minutes.

equally zealous in feeding young while still callow, but in the later
nestling stages I had the impression that the cock did rather more
feeding than the hen. Neither of my captive hens that reared young
were seen to feed them after they left the nest. The male (Double
Green) continued to do so until the young birds' tails were fully grown,
although by that time they had been feeding themselves quite com-
petently for about a week and the male had been incubating a further
clutch of eggs. This was in marked contrast to a brood of Avadavats
in the same room. The hen Avadavat was just as solicitous in feeding
her fledged young as was their father.
The behaviour of the parent Blue-breasts shows immediately when
eggs have hatched. As soon as the brooding parent is relieved by its
mate, it flies at once to the maggot dish or, if no maggots are to hand,
commences a frantic search for insects. Any plants placed in the room
are immediately searched for greenfly or other edible insects. From the
behaviour and food consump tion of the parents it was evident that they
fed the young principally, if not entirely, on maggots and other insects
for about the first eight or ten days, After this their consumption of
maggots decreased and they evidently fed the young largely on seeds

and other vegetable food. When the young started to feed themselves
they were at first entirely vegetarian and were not seen to take maggots
(which were always available to them) until some weeks after they
had become independent of their parents. How accurately this
reflects feeding habits in the wild it would be of interest to learn. In
all essentials the feeding behaviour of young Avadavats in captivity
seems closely parallel, which suggests a natural feeding choice pattern
rather than an artifact of captive conditions. The young, like those of
most estrildines, beg with head held low and twisted sideways and
without any fluttering of the wings.
Voice
The Blue-breast has a variety of call-notes that appear to express
different moods and to serve different functions. As attempts to convey
the sound of birds' calls in words must always be inadequate and
subjective, I have deemed it best to name calls according to what
I believe to be their function. Although the calls here listed are distinct
enough in " pure " form, and when given at fairly high intensity,
most of them intergrade. As the bird's mood changes so it may, and
commonly does, give vent to almost any intermediate between any
two calls. In discussing calls I have, as is usual, used the term " func-
tion " for the (presumed) reasons that the call is useful in the sense of
having survival value, for the individual or its species ; and " motiva-
tion " for the (presumed) mood of the bird that prompts it to cry out.
But I do not thereby imply that the ability to give vent to feelings by
calling out is not in itself functional so far as the individual may there-
by be enabled to relieve tension.
The Flying Call
A sharp, sibilant but not very loud " Tsit-tsit-tsit " or " Zip-Zip "
is frequently uttered by birds that are restless. They give it particularly
and with much vehemence just before and after taking wing. Not if
they just fly from one branch to another but when from their restless-
ness, or as a result of some alarm (such as myself cleaning their room)

it seems probable that if they were free they would fly some distance.
The motivation seems to be that the calling bird is in a " flying-
away " or " continuing to fly " mood. It probably functions in a wild
state to inform the mate or companions that the bird is going to fly,
to arouse a like mood in them and thus stimulate them to fly after
the calling bird ; possibly also to maintain contact while in flight.

The Contact Call
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.995554305555556" page_id="56317582"  page_num="165" year="" vol="">
A loud, clear " Tseep-tseep ! 55 or " Sweet-sweet ! 55 with, to my
ears, a somewhat interrogative tone. Undoubtedly this is the call
described by McLachlan and Liversidge (1957) as " an urgent sounding
c weety-weet 5 or # weet-weet' It is said by these authors to be the
Blue-breast's " usual call ". I suspect, however, that this is only true
in so far as it is one that, from its nature, is probably most often heard
from birds being closely observed by Man. It is given under conditions
of mild alarm or uneasiness ; especially when the bird begins to recover
confidence after being seriously frightened. My birds, or some of
them, give it frequently when I move about in their room ; if some
sudden, loud and unusual noise (they ignore noises they are used to) is
made elsewhere in the house it is almost always followed by loud
Contact Calls from one or more of the Blue-breasts. If I catch a
Blue-breast and release it in some other room in the house it begins to
give the Contact Call as soon as it recovers from its first fright at being
handled and the strange environment. Once started it continues to
call loudly and almost incessantly ; this arouses a similar mood in the
others (or some of them) and they also give the Contact Call with
great vehemence and frequency. Presumably the function of this call
is to maintain contact between individuals or, and more especially,
to enable a bird that has temporarily lost sight of its mate or companions
to re-establish contact.
The Begging Call
A repeated cheeping with a somewhat querulous ## nagging ",
tone. Used by nestlings and juveniles when begging for food and by
the adult when nest-calling. I have also heard it from the male
Ringless when trying to " entice " Double Green's mate from him.
Sometimes I saw him give the begging note, looking at the female in
question, but without, or with only a suggestion of the movements
characteristic of nest-calling ; on other occasions a long series of anger
notes directed at Double Green gradually changed to almost (but not
quite) C# pure " begging notes as he looked at his rival. Since the desired
female was perching near her mate at the time, it is possible that the
begging element in his calls had reference to her.
The nest-calling of the adult seems to differ slightly in sound from
the food-begging of the young (and both vary considerably in loudness

according, presumably, to the bird's degree of eagerness) but not
sufficiently for me to be always able to tell them if I am not watching,
or to describe the slight difference. The begging note would appear to
express a feeling of dependence on (? and inferiority to) another from
whom some specific response, normally feeding (for the juvenile) or
joining mate on nest-site (for the nest-calling adult) is intensely desired.
The Threat Call
A staccato " Tchek-tchek " or " Chick-chick ", subject to much
variation of tone or pitch, but typically rather suggestive of the scolding
note of the Blackbird ( Turdus merula) although less metallic in tone,
seems always to be motivated by anger at another Blue-breast. It is
given particularly by a dominant or winning individual after it has
attacked or chased its enemy and is frequently followed by a further
attack. The calling bird always looks directly at the bird it is threaten-
ing. It seems at least as often inspired by " pure " anger as by any
conflict of emotions since it is given by birds that show little or no
signs of being afraid of the enemy they are " cursing " in this manner.
It was given with great vehemence and frequency by Light Hen and
Ringless at the birds whose mates they were trying (with ultimate
success) to " steal
The Alarm Call
A short rattling or churring note, subject to much variation, sugges-
tive of the scolding notes of the Mistle Thrush ( Turdus viscivorus) and
those of the Wren ( Troglodytes troglodytes) . This call seems to be
an expression of any strong emotion, particularly fear or anger,
usually aroused other than by a fellow member of the species. Some
element of conflict, or frustration, seems almost always to be involved.
I often heard this note when a Diamond Dove or a Canary was perched
on or very near a Blue-breast's nest. It was then always accompanied
by intention-movements (wing and tail flicking whilst looking directly
at the " enemy ") of flying to attack, although I never saw an actual
attack materialize. Fear or disquiet alone do not seem to elicit this
call. My Blue-breasts never used the Alarm Call at me (though I
often frightened them by cleaning operations) until they had young.
Then, if I looked into a nest or approached a fledged young one, the
parents, especially the father, gave the Alarm Call at me with the
utmost vehemence. A Blue-breast held in the hand never gives this
note, but it may do so at the moment that it is released and as it flies
quickly from the hand. Undoubtedly in the wild this is a predator-
mobbing call and functions to warn others of danger. Other Blue-
breasts, in captivity, react (sometimes) by flying quickly up into the
branches and/or looking intently about them for danger. They can
tell (much more accurately than their owner !) whether the Alarm

Call is " genuine " or merely being given in exasperation at some non-
dangerous mishap (as when the caller is angry because he has failed
to catch a flying insect) and in the latter case they show no concern
whatsoever.
An exception to the general rule that this call is not evoked by other
Blue-breasts was that the male Double Green, when his mate was
inside the nest feeding their young, would usually give a short trilling
" rattle " as soon as the young uttered their loud begging notes.
Possibly in his anxiety over the young, any noise from them when he
was not with them, was " upsetting " to him.
The Fear Screech
A short, harsh screech is often given by one of two fighting birds.
Usually, but not always, it is given at moments of physical contact
and I think then it is the bird that has been seized or pecked that
screeches at the moment of injury. Fledglings often give this screech
when handled although adults, in my experience, do not. When given
by young birds it causes intense fear responses in other young and elicits
intense alarm rattles from the parents, especially the father. Doubtless
if the young were seized by any predator that the parents could hope
to deal with successfully, they would attack under these circumstances.
This call is thus homologous with the screeching or screaming cries of
most other passerines (see Goodwin, 19560) and is apparently normally
the expression of fear. A long-drawn rather husky version of it is,
however, sometimes given by a male who is giving the stem display if
another bird interferes. He may then fly off with the stem giving this
version of the screech as he does so. He shows no signs of fear and
re-commences his display on re-alighting. Possibly this version of the
screech expresses exasperation rather than fear.

Two other notes heard seem worth mentioning, though I cannot, as
yet claim to be able to elucidate them. A short " Chick-ick " or
" Tchittick ", subject to much variation, is frequently uttered by
young birds. I have not heard it with certainty from fully adult
specimens. It intergrades with the alarm rattle and may be a very low
intensity variant of it. Often the bird giving it shows no signs of alarm
or anger but equally often its utterance is accompanied, or immediately
followed, by pecking or pulling at twigs or other objects, which suggests
the possibility of aggressive feelings being involved. It is the note most
commonly interjected into the rambling song of the juvenile.
A soft " Tuc-tuc " is often uttered at dusk by birds going to roost.
I suspect it to be used by mates calling each other to snuggle together,
but I have never been able to see for certain which bird was making
this very soft call.

Song
</subsectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.998212419354839" page_id="56317585"  page_num="168" year="" vol="">
The Blue-breast has a short but pleasant little song with a rising
inflection. " Chre-chreu, chre, chre chittyweeoo ! 55 and " Chreu,
chreu, chittyoo, weeoo, wee ! 55 are two of my attempts to paraphrase
individual's songs but I fear such attempts may be more misleading
than helpful to those who have not heard the species. McLachlan
and Liversidge (1957) describe it as " a lively little song interspersed
with c weety-weets I have not myself heard an adult intersperse
its song with this or any other call note, nor have I heard an adult
female sing.
The song, like that of other estrildines (Morris, 1958) seems to be
mainly sexual in character, although at times the sexual feeling would
seem to be very slight or at any rate " sublimated Often the song
appears to be little more than an expression of general well-being.
It certainly has no threatening or territorial implications although
birds that are unwell, injured or bullied by others cease to sing. The
singing bird is usually either perched alone or else giving the Stem
Display (q.v.). In the former case it often makes low intensity movements
similar to those used in display. If another bird approaches the singer
these movements tend, at any rate in adolescent birds, to be intensified.
My young Blue-breasts from a few weeks after leaving the nest,
spent much of their time singing in an inconsequential manner. As
is the case with many other species, the variety of sounds given in the
course of this warbling was much greater than in the song of the adult.
It seemed as if the young birds were trying out every possible sound
that they were capable of uttering ; all the various call notes were
freely and constantly interjected into their songs at this period. Such
notes used in the immature's song seem to have a " playful " character
the bird giving them not appearing to be inspired by the feelings that
normally evoke such calls. Both male and female juveniles sang but
before the young males had attained adult plumage and their warbling
" crystallized out " into the adult song their sisters had ceased to sing.

(Columha arquatrix)
By Denby Collins (Malton, Yorkshire, England)
I acquired a pair of Rameron or Olive Pigeons (Columba arquatrix)
early in December, 1958, and being unable to purchase plain olives,
bought two bottles of pickled olives, my idea being to make the birds
feel at home. Although I rinsed, soaked, and swilled them with cold
water until, I myself, was unable to detect any salt taint--the birds
thought otherwise and would have nothing to do with them. They
continued eating wheat and rolled oats and after a month or so I got
them on to eating proprietary egg food, moistened with milk.
They improved enormously in condition after this, put on a
wonderful bloom and started billing. I was not able to distinguish
the cock from the hen, except when both were together, and am still
unable to do so. There has never been a sound from these birds
whilst I have been within earshot and they are almost identical in
colouring and shape.
The birds are housed in a 12 by 8 feet hen-house with a flight
12 feet wide by 15 feet long. At the end of the flight away from the
house, I put a 6-inch plank the whole 12 feet across, in order to make them
exercise. I left a 4 inch gap between the shelf and the wire-netting
and to my dismay on 14th April on going out to feed the birds in the
morning, I found two broken eggs on the ground, obviously laid on
the shelf and then rolled off. This in spite of the fact that I had
provided three nest pans with sawdust, straw, and fine sticks, inside
the house. I filled in the gap between the shelf and end wire-netting
with \ inch mesh netting, put a 3 by 2 feet sheet of corrugated asbestos
sheeting over the corner of the aviary and blinded the side netting
with yew branches.
A thought struck me--my information was that only one egg was
laid per nest, whereas I had two broken eggs in, at the most, two days.
Therefore, I decided, I must have two hens, which would account for
no cooing by the cock.
The same week there appeared an advertisement for a Rameron
cock, which I purchased as a standby. This bird I confined in a

canary breeding cage within the hen-house, in order to forestall any
fighting. There he remained for three weeks during which time the
original birds laid another egg and deserted after three weeks sitting--
an infertile egg. So I let out No. 2 cock and a further egg was laid after
three days ; this vanished mysteriously and I think it must have been
carried, perhaps stuck to the underfeathers of the hen, and dropped
in what was by now long grass in the flight. Scything the grass failed
to uncover the egg, however, and I cursed my luck. No. 2 cock tried
his best to make up to the original hen and was chased, perfunctorily,
by No. 1 cock, but there was no malice shown by either bird, nor did
either make any sound.
The fifth egg was laid, I believe, on 18th June and hatched on
6th July. I was made aware of this by finding the shell of the egg,
discarded by one of the parents, inside the hen-house and I jumped
for joy, but restrained myself with great difficulty from disturbing the
birds by probing into the nest.
The parents (the originals) showed almost the same procedure in
sitting their egg and rearing their young, as domestic pigeons. The
hen sat from about 4 p.m. to 10 a.m. and the cock from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m., the same seemed to happen after hatching, though they were
loth to allow me to see them feeding the squab. I had to hide in an
adjacent building and be still and silent, before I was rewarded in
seeing a small beak pushing out from under the hen's breast at 7 p.m.
on 1 ith July. The birds sat tight for over a week although the weather
was very dry and warm and I wondered whether they would smother
the chick ; so I decided to investigate and ring the squab at the same
time.
All was well, the hen fought me when I prodded about underneath
her, but I secured a fine healthy youngster and put a celulloid ring on,
which seemed somewhat tight on the leg. I then made inquiries and
after some time got some open aluminium rings of " Runt " size.
When the birds were three weeks old a friend came along and took
some photos and at four weeks, when the squab had taken two or three
practice flights, I thought the celluloid ring was causing discomfort so
decided to change it for the larger aluminium ring. I got one of my
assistants to help me catch the squab. When half-way through
the operation it went limp in my hands and though I tried all sorts of
means to revive it, it was dead.
Disappointment, chagrin, self condemnation, were of no avail.
I expected nothing after this, but the hen laid again on 1st August,
though she did not start to sit until 4th August. In the meantime
I expected a second egg, but this did not materialize. She hatched on

These are very peculiar pigeons. Mackworth-Praed and Grant,
African Handbook of Birds , i : 466. 44 Call : a deep rumbling noise
ending in a 4 Coo ', not unmusical, but rather monotonous. Also,
when excited, a whistling note." Mine have never made a sound,
apart from wheezy, asthmatical, deep-breathing exercises.
They are not wild or flighty, indeed when sitting, either bird will
fight my hand, but it is very difficult to make any observations as to
demeanour as the birds sense that they are being watched. It was
only on nth September that I saw the cock displaying to his hen--no
sweep of the tail, just standing up to the full extent, blowing out his
neck and bowing straight up and down--but not a sound, as one
would have expected. 18th September I saw (again by subterfuge)
the cock feeding the squab. The normal way of feeding, except that
the youngster did not make a sound. Cocks that don't coo and
squeakers that don't squeak ! Now that the youngster is fledged it is
noticeable that instead of being spotted white on chest, belly and wing
shoulders, the feathers are edged greyish-white, the nape is the dark-
grey of the whole of the body, wings, and tail ; the eyes are dark ;
beak wattles and legs and claws of practically the same colour, with
no sign at present of any change to yellow.
Another interesting feature--when cock No. 1 chases cock No. 2
away from his hen and nest, he rarely uses his beak, but takes
lumbering steps and jumps at his quarry, moving him on perhaps
a foot and then going through the same process again. But still no
sound from either pursuer or pursued.
They are not voracious feeders as the usual run of pigeons are, but
rather delicate eaters and not at all fussy over their food. Big, stolid
birds they are quite hardy as they rarely seek the shelter of the house
at nights, even when snow a foot deep covers everything, but they
spend the midday hours inside, especially during the hot weather we
have had this summer.
Delightful birds in appearance, their habits fascinate me and I hope
to learn a lot more about them in the future.
This happened two days after writing the above passage--these
birds are not mute, as I had thought. I heard the cock, previous to
feeding his squab (at over five weeks old) make a noise like the lowest
note of a bassoon played pianissimo and repeated several times--
I have not heard any more conversation.

By Dillon Ripley (Litchfield, Conn., U.S.A.)
In 1943 (Avicultural Magazine, 5th Ser., vol. 7, p. 68),
I speculated that the Laysan Teal would probably never be kept in
captivity and might indeed be extinct. What a particular pleasure it
was then to receive two pairs of these curious little birds in August,
1958, at my waterfowl preserve at Litchfield, Connecticut. I had
never seen the species alive and was immediately struck by their small
size, slim, rather elongated shape, and skulking carriage, and by the
fact that the tiny bills of the birds are distinctly spatulate at their
distal ends, closer in shape to Cinnamon Teal than to most other ducks.
The brown plumage of the adults also, chocolate brown with coarse,
dark brown edgings, is reminiscent of the plumage of some female
Shoveller Ducks, the Cape Shoveller particularly.
And yet these little birds are derived from Mallard stock, as their
relative, the Hawaiian Duck, clearly shows. But in the process of long
isolation on Laysan Island, they have diverged away strongly from
the parent line. Laysan is a two mile by one mile strip of coral sand
some 800 miles north-west of Oahu, the Hawaiian Island on which
Honolulu is situated. There is a brackish pond on the island and since
the elimination of the rabbits, which were introduced rather
catastrophically about 1903, the vegetation, formerly eaten away,
has returned to clothe the sand dunes. As a result of the restoration
of the habitat and the consequent increase of the insect population,
Laysan Teal have increased from an estimated twenty in 1923, to
over 500 in 1958. It was partly due to this rather extreme oscillation
in numbers that, on behalf of the International Council for Bird
Preservation, I and others wrote to the Fish and Wildlife authorities
of the United States Government in 1956 and 1957, suggesting that a
small number of the Teal be taken into captivity in order to secure
a buffer population against possible catastrophes on Laysan. Although
the Leeward chain of the Hawaiian Archipelago is theoretically a bird
preserve by order of President Theodore Roosevelt, there is in fact
no enforcement and strangers landing from a yacht or fishing vessel
could easily wreak havoc among the unprotected birds, either by
hunting or by the casual introduction of vermin or domestic animals.

The Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife in Washington responded
with welcome enthusiasm, and their officials have been extraordinarily
helpful and co-operative. A small number of Laysan Teal were taken
in 1957 and 1958 which are now housed in the Honolulu Zoo, and in
several zoos and collections in the United States as well as the Wildfowl
Trust. It is hoped that a suitable site will be found on Lisiansky or
one of the other neighbouring islets of the Leeward chain for an eventual
introduction to supplement the Laysan population.
Our Laysan Teal at Litchfield quickly settled down to an artificial
diet. The birds appear to be hardy and strong even though we kept
them indoors during their first winter. The Teal are rather aggressive,
not only among themselves, but also worrying and fussing other duck,
often much larger than they are. In this second summer, we have had
to separate the two adult males. Essentially, however, they do appear
to be more aggressive inter se than with other species.
As I have written elsewhere (1959, Wilson Bull., in press), no
striking display activities were observed when the Teal were released
on two small ponds this past spring. However, one female nested
twice, laying five eggs in each clutch. The second female appeared
ready to nest, and was observed in a scrape, but did not carry nesting
through to completion. Four ducklings hatched from each of the
two clutches, on 8th July, 1959, and 13th and 14th August. The
eggs were extremely large for the size of the bird, virtually as large as
Mallard eggs and the young were very vigorous and presented no
difficulty whatsoever in rearing. The aggressive behaviour, large
eggs and vigorous, energetic young are perhaps all associated with the
realities of intraspecific competition. It would appear implicit in the
survival of this species that the young should be well endowed from
the beginning, nourished with a plentiful yolk supply and well able to
take care of themselves.
The bills of the ducklings are noticeably spatulate from hatching,
perhaps an adaptation to a completely insectivorous diet as has been
reported by Warner (in litt.). Comparison of the bills of this species
and the Hawaiian Duck, however, although revealing a difference in
shape, does not show any difference in the number or arrangement of
the lamellae.
The downy Laysan grew rapidly and soon assumed their first basic
plumage, apparently identical with the adult except for the uniform
dark feathers of the face and ocular region. Now at the age of
three months, the first white feathers are beginning to appear one by
one forming a very narrow ring about the eye itself. Apparently
these feathers will continue to appear during the winter as the birds
gradually approach the adult condition in which irregular areas of
white surround the eyes and extend on to the cheeks and auricular
areas.

Although sombre in appearance, these little, soberly coloured Teal
are of great interest biologically, and their miniature proportions and
chocolate tones give them a certain distinction in collections. It is to
be hoped that eventually a considerable number can be reared in
captivity in order to provide an auxiliary population to that isolated
and exposed one of Laysan Island.

Other breeding results this past summer at Litchfield have been
sparse. We reared a round dozen of Emperor Geese, but although
Siberian Red-breasted, Ross' Snow, Cackling, Bar-headed Geese and
a considerable number of duck species nested, we reared an insignificant
number of young. With the geese part of the trouble was fighting
over nest sites which led to desertion or breaking of eggs. Another
year we must closely supervise any such internecine strife. Fortunately
vermin seem to be far less of a menace, although, as always, our only
losses were among the rarest species, three Baer's Pochards taken by
an owl. The addition of night lights to the ponds seems to have
dampened the spirits of these persistent nocturnal marauders. Mean-
while, racoons and their ilk seem to be unable to overcome the
electrically charged strands of wire which girdle our fences top and
bottom. Our paddling ponds are becoming fortified.

A POTOO FOR THE BROOKFIELD ZOO

For the first time we have a Potoo (Nyctibius grandis) or Grand
Nightjar as it is sometimes called. So far as can be ascertained it is
the first one in captivity in America. If not, we would be happy to
hear about it.
In size and general appearance it resembles the Australian Frog-
mouth, but the beak is smaller, much like that of our Night Hawk
(Chordeiles minor) ; the gape is very wide, about 3 inches. Probably
the most noticeable features are the enormous, beady black eyes and
the upper eyelids which have the upper lids distinctly scalloped into
four sections while the lower lids follow the perfect circle of the eye.
The eyes at first appear jet black but closer examination shows the
iris to be very deep slate colour. To date we cannot find any reference
about these curious eyelids.
Up to now we have not heard the weird cries ascribed to the genus
but on occasion when handled it utters a rapid frog-like croak or a
deep ferocious sounding snarl ; the most frequent sound is made by
its beak and sounding like the clappering of a stork. This is most often

and usually heard when we hand-feed it. This is done by gently
pressing on each side of the beak which is then opened to a prodigious
gape under the eyes. A small ball of chopped meat, to which has
been added a drop of Tronic compound, is then expertly tossed in this
yawning cavity and, after the bird has swallowed it, it usually receives
seven or eight more. It gets this amount morning and late afternoon
and as these meat balls weigh 2 ounces altogether, it gets 1 ounce
twice a day. Often between the swallows it makes the clappering
sound. When last weighed it was exactly 20 ounces.
We have not seen it leave its perch voluntarily ; the normal pose is
like that of an owl--upright and looking straight ahead. Very seldom
does it assume the position of the beak and head at a 90 degree angle--
usually shown in illustrations. I have been told that this is the pose
taken when sitting on eggs or young on the flat, upright end of a
broad bough. The bird measures about 20 inches in length.
The bird does not show any response to our talking to it, so perhaps
it is not very intelligent, but it is an interesting specimen. At any rate
we hope to keep it a long time (it arrived in June, 1959) and let it
puzzle the public, who do not seem to accept our explanation that
it is not an owl though our label starts out with this statement.
In his Birds of the West Indies Bond mentions a smaller species which
is found in Jamaica and Haiti. This is the Grey Potoo (Nyctibius griseus)
whose length is 17 inches. The habits of the seven species of Potoos
are all very similar ; they are nocturnal birds feeding mostly on large
moths. They nest on decayed stumps of various heights and lay but
a single white egg which is lightly spotted with violet and brown.
The name Potoo is derived from one of its guttural cries " ho-hoo ".

DARENTH-HULME, 1959
By Kay Bonner (Southgate, England)
The very remarkable weather during the past summer has been
responsible for either breaking or establishing many and varied records.
It has not, however, contributed to any special successes amongst the
birds in our collection. It is true we do not really expect anything
sensational, a large number of the birds being of somewhat doubtful
breeding potential, but, nevertheless, the hope is always there.
None of the more important psittacines did anything about nesting.
The Green-winged Kings are still too young : the Patagonian Conures
had no interest in their own nest-boxes, only in cutting through the
wire-netting and gaining access to lovebird nest-boxes in the neigh-
bouring aviary : the five pairs of White-bellied and Black-headed
Caiques had a wonderful season destroying their aviaries--the larch
poles are now about eight years old and so are very easy whittling.

K. BONNER--DARENTH-HULME, 1959
To us it is rather ironic that we should have tried during half a
lifetime to breed Red-faced Lovebirds, with singularly little success,
and that David Dale in South Africa should breed a very splendid
nest of five almost at the first attempt ! The few young we have
managed to breed have been poorly developed and, in the main,
short-lived.
Many of our birds show a great partiality for mealworms and receive
a daily ration. We are surprised at the eagerness shown by the
Budgerigars, but the Red-faced refuse to accept this supplement to
their monotonous diet of soaked millet sprays and apples.
The many mynahs proved too great a nuisance in the wilderness
aviary, so they were removed to allow the smaller birds a better chance
to breed without undue interference. Some restocking was done with
Red-crested Cardinals, Cordon Bleus, Yellow-chinned Sparrows,
numerous small seedeaters and a pair of Giant Whydahs. There
have been quite a few natural increases, but nothing out of the ordinary.
Early in the year Jack Indge supplied us with ten unnamed doves
from British Guiana. John Yealland was able to identify them as the
Bronze-necked Dove Z en aidura auriculata rubripes , a subspecies apparently
new to aviculture. These were put in the wilderness aviary and the
conditions must have been fully to their liking as they have reared at
least two dozen young ones.
About eighteen months ago K. E. L. Simmons, of Great Crested
Grebe fame, gave us a green Budgerigar cock and a Madagascar
Lovebird hen that had formed a great attachment for each other.
Last year they occupied a nest-box without result, but this year the
Madagascar laid a clutch of four eggs, not surprisingly infertile, and
at the present moment (mid-October) is endeavouring to incubate a
second clutch.
Almost everyone who keeps Galapagos Doves appears to breed them
as freely as domestic pigeons. But such has not been our experience.
During the winter, while the three pairs were together, they laid
numerous eggs, even succeeded in hatching several, but due to inter-
ference invariably deserted the young ones almost immediately.
When the spring came and they were split up into pairs they ceased
laying, the breeding rhythm being interrupted. They eventually
recommenced laying but showed little inclination to incubate so the
eggs were transferred to Barbarys and Javas. Some half-dozen eggs
were hatched, but the foster-parents failed to rear any young beyond
a week. Late in the year three were reared by their parents.
The Green Imperial Pigeons hatched four single young very early
in the year, but having hatched them, showed no further interest.
They did, however, rear one very good one in September. The Pied
Imperial laid numerous infertile eggs. The Lemon Doves were again
successful, rearing several young.

The only major loss was with the very vicious Black Bronze-winged

and having started it is a fight to the finish. One was found battered
to death and the other died as the result of its injuries a few days later.

By A. L. Rand (Chief Curator of Zoology, Chicago Natural History
Museum, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.)
We had thought that the known Philippine avifauna had completely
escaped the blight of extinction, to which island faunas are so
vulnerable, until Dr. Rabor (1959, Auk, 76, pp. 37-43) pointed out
that, correlated with deforestation, nine Cebu Island forms and one
Siquijor Island form were probably extinct. Among these is the
Cebu Golden-backed Hanging Parrakeet, Loriculus philippensis chry-
sonotus , of which Rabor had no record since 1906, when McGregor
collected it.
However, Mr. Karl Plath, of the Chicago Zoological Society,
Brookfield, Illinois, has just given Chicago Natural History Museum
a specimen of L. p. chrysonotus that lived in his private aviary from
October, 1929, to January, 1930. Plath got this bird from a California
dealer, who wrote that he got it through a man he sent to the
Philippines, and who was in Cebu City. However, live L. p. chrysonotus
became available in England from another source about this time,
for Mr. Walter Goodfellow brought back to England twelve individuals
on his return from the Orient (. Aviculture , 2, 2nd series (1930), p. 93).
Probably it is from this latter source that the birds came which are
mentioned in the Avicultural Magazine, 1929-43. Evidently the
form existed in some numbers in Cebu until 1929, at least, and
in captivity in the London Zoo until 1943.
It is true that chrysonotus is considered one of the subspecies of the
Philippine Hanging Parrakeet, but along with several others is so
distinct in colour as to raise the suspicion that they might behave as
species if brought together. The only further evidence is that from a
mating of L. p. chrysonotus male with L. p. worcesteri female, 1931-34,
in the Marquis of Tavistock's aviaries. This mixed pair produced
eggs each year, but all were infertile. This evidence, and the lack of
known hybrids in the genus in captivity, must be used with caution,
for none of the species kept in captivity have been bred successfully
despite some having been imported into England before 1794, and
several near-successes in breeding (Prestwich, 1952, Records of Parrots
Bred in Captivity , pt. 5, pp, 225-226). Perhaps this has been one of the

reasons the Loriculus species have not been popular with aviculturists
despite birds often being available in eastern markets. Mr. Plath tells
me he has not seen them listed by American dealers for twenty-five
years, though there are a few individuals of certain species in American
aviaries. Strangely, L. p. chrysonotus was recently listed as one of the
species likely to be seen in captivity (Bedford, 1954, Parrots and Parrot-
like Birds , p. 59).
It should be pointed out that the plate accompanying the original
description of chrysonotus is unsatisfactory, as Salvadori (1891, Cat.
Bds. Brit. Mus., 20, p. 522), has pointed out. I have seen a single
adult male (U.S. Nat. Mus. Coll.) which agrees better with the plate
facing page 154, in Seth-Smith's 1903 Parrakeets, but differs chiefly in
having the whole throat patch light-red to its edge, without a yellow
margin, and in having the foreback darker and more orange.
Hachisuka's plate (1934, Bds. Philipp. Isis., 2, pi. 12) has the fore back
and crown much too red compared with the adult male specimen
and has the yellow outlining the red throat patch conspicuous, as in
Seth-Smith's plate. Only some of these discrepancies can be due to
individual variation in the birds, as the male in the first two plates is
based on the type.
The Plath bird we have received is a male, but differs in a number
of ways from the adult male : in having the orange-yellow of crown
duller and in the much reduced dull orange (not golden-orange) on
the foreback ; in the small (not large) red throat patch, and in its
small size (wing 94 mm.). The upper-parts are similar to those of
certain females, but the green side of the head and the red throat are
male characters. The small size compares with wing, adult $ 105,
$ (4) 99 _I *2 (av. 100.5) &amp;gt; immature $ 103, # 103, 104 mm., in the
U.S. Nat. Mus. series (courtesy of Mr. H. Deignan). Presumably it is
an immature male.

release of birds.
The film which had taken several years to make, mainly before the

When the fine collection of the late M. J. Bruyneel was dispersed,
many of the birds were acquired by M. Florizoone, Parc Meli,
Adinkerke (La Panne), and added to his already very extensive
collection. Members will be interested to know that amongst them
are the blue Quaker Parrakeets and the lutino Ring-necked Parrakeets.

There can be no reasonable doubt that the wild ancestor of the
familiar Barbary Dove was the Pink-headed or Rose-grey Turtle Dove
Streptopelia roseogrisea. Cream-coloured and white varieties, the latter
the so-called Java Dove, are, of course, equally well known. It is
usually assumed that the Java is an albino, but W. R. Partridge is now
breeding a strain with black eyes.

Peter O. Williams has bred the Mexican Ground Dove Columbigallina
passerina pallescens. Two young have been reared from two nests.
This is the third season this pair has nested, eggs laid during the two
previous being infertile. There are eighteen races of C. passerina , the
breeding of one of which was described by J. P. Newell (Athlone) in
the last number of the Magazine. The Passerine Dove was first bred
in Great Britain by Henry Willford, Isle of Wight, in 1909, since
when there do not appear to have been any other reports.

Douglas Moore reports : " During the 1958 breeding season an
interesting mutation occurred in a nest of Diamond Sparrows. Two
fawns appeared in one nest which also contained three normals.
The parent birds deserted when the youngsters were just nicely
feathered. This season the eggs were transferred to Bengalese and
again a fawn has appeared. General body colour that of a fawn
Zebra but still retaining the red rump, and a rather darker fawn
replacing the black markings of the Diamond. The Diamonds are
aviary-bred to the fourth generation."

O. E. Dunmore has bred the Black Tanager Tachyphonus rufus.
He writes : " Three eggs were laid in a deep, cup-shaped nest built
on the ground under a small privet bush. Two were clear but the
third hatched and the young one is now independent. In colour it is
like the hen but rather darker when seen from above, although in the
flight it is difficult to see any difference. Pretre's Tanagers laid last
year but would not build although the hen sat on odd eggs on the
floor." This Tanager was first bred by Teschemaker, in Devon, in
1906, two reared. Later records are London Zoo, 1909, one ; 1925,
three ; Page, 1913, one ; 1914, one and two ; Willford, 1915, several 1
broods.

The nesting of birds in the nests of social insects is much more
extensive than is generally supposed. In an absorbingly interesting
paper in The Emu , 1959, 1-36, K. A. Hindwood lists twenty-three
species of kingfishers, thirteen of parrots, four of woodpeckers, four
of trogons, two of puff-birds, a jacamar, and a cotinga--a total of
forty-eight species--known to breed in either terrestrial or arboreal
nests of termites. In addition, two species of woodpeckers are known
to use ants' nests as nest-sites ; but only one species of trogon has so i
far been recorded nesting within a wasps' nest. The cavities in old 1
and deserted termites' nests are at times used as nesting-places by
birds that normally breed in earth-banks or tree-hollows.

in Hastings has bred several hybrids from a Greater Sulphur-crested
Cockatoo hen and a Blood-stained Cockatoo cock. The offspring are
really attractive. They are a little smaller than the Sulphur-crest and
have a patch of bare skin around the eye from the male parent.
The crest is the same shape as in the Sulphur-crest, only a bit smaller
and more orange than yellow. Their owners can do almost anything
with them and they are quite good talkers."

A great deal has appeared in the daily press about the return of the
Ospreys and their successful breeding in the Scottish Highlands
for the first time in forty-nine years. It seems fitting that the bare
facts, at least, should be recorded in the Magazine.
In 1955 a pair nested but no chicks were hatched. The following
year another pair nested and the eggs were stolen. In 1957 the male
of another pair was shot. Last year a pair nested and, in spite of the
vigilance of watchers, an egg-stealer succeeded in removing the eggs
only to break them at the foot of the tree as he made his escape.
This last summer the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was
determined there should be no repetition of past failures. The same
pair of Ospreys returned to the same Scots pine, near Loch Garten,
Inverness-shire, and due entirely to the unceasing day and night

reminders to no less than 400 members. Second applications were sent
to 228, and third to 138. This was a shocking waste of the Society's

of unnecessary and avoidable work. Let us try and do better next year,

FUNDAMENTALS OF ORNITHOLOGY. By Josselyn Van
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99074" page_id="56317605"  page_num="184" year="" vol="">
Tyne and Andrew J. Berger. Chapman and Hall, London,
1959. Pri ce 94J. net.
The senior author, late Curator of Birds, University of Michigan
Museum of Zoology, for many years had been preparing a text book
of ornithology and before his death in 1957 had completed the chapters
on plumage and moult, migration, bird distribution, ornithological
sources and the classification of birds by families ; about half the
chapters on anatomy, and food and feeding habits ; also a few
pages on territory, and eggs and breeding behaviour. Dr. Berger
completed these chapters and also wrote the remaining chapters of
the book dealing with palaeontology, voice and sound production,
taxonomy and nomenclature, senses and behaviour, flight and social
relations, in addition to a glossary and table of contents. The book
was intended to provide a background for Dr. Van Tyne's graduate
course in ornithology and students were expected to possess a general
knowledge of biology and at least an undergraduate qualification in
zoology, before specializing in ornithology.
The result is a comprehensive text book on the subject, and will
also fill many other needs such as a quick reference for information
on all families of birds ; a dictionary of ornithological terms, a general
reference for those interested in life-history, taxonomy and anatomy ;
a summary of anatomical characters used in the classification of
birds ; and a guide to ornithological literature. The author has
adopted the plan of devoting one page to each family in the section
dealing with the classification of birds, and whilst this method may

have certain advantages for purposes of reference, it is liable to give
a very mistaken idea of birds in general, for the same space is given
to a family with only a single representative as one containing
hundreds of widely distributed species.
The book is beautifully produced and with its numerous illustrations
will be a useful reference work for both the amateur and professional
ornithologist.

BIOLOGY. By J. D. Macdonald. Museum Press, Ltd.
London, 1959. Price 12s. 6 d. net.
In his preface Mr. J. D. Macdonald, who is Deputy Keeper of
Zoology of the Natural History Museum, states that his purpose
"is to provide a brief outline of the whole life of birds, including
matters as diverse as courtship behaviour, the mysterious contents of
an egg and how they get there, the mechanical perfection of the
locking mechanism on a feather vane, the unique adaptation of birds
for flight, the fascinating perplexity of migration ". In this the author
has succeeded admirably and explains his subject in lucidly and in
simple language. Though in his preface he also states that he stresses
the words " brief outline 55 and admits that many subjects have to be
omitted, this is a useful and comprehensive book. It is divided into
12 chapters--Preparation for Mating ; Nests and Eggs and Family
Care ; Population ; Migration ; Distribution ; Habitats and
Adaptations ; Adaptations for flight ; Feathers ; Collecting and
Digesting food ; Lungs and Heart ; Other Anatomical Features ;
Variation and Evolution. Particularly interesting are the Tables of
the incubation periods of some of the commoner birds which breed in
Britain and the weights of various British species ; and a map showing
the faunal regions of the world is most helpful. There are sixteen
half-tone plates ; and twenty drawings illustrate various points treated
in the text. Though the book is addressed to young ornithologists it
will also be appreciated by the not so young.

LEMON (OLIVE) DOVES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999292227272727" page_id="56317607"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
In his article on " Breeding Galapagos and other Doves " Professor Carl Naether
refers to the Lemon (Olive) Doves in the possession of Mr. Melville M. Strann of
Northridge, California. I would like to state that I supplied these to Mr. Strann.
It is quite correct that I listed them as Rameron Pigeons-- Columba arquatrix --in
accordance with the classification in Dr. Austin Roberts' Birds of South Africa --
revised edition, second impression. The name " Olive " is, according to Roberts,
a popular name derived from the birds' liking for olives, whereas E. Leonard Gill
in his First Guide to South African Birds , third edition, definitely refers to them as Olive
Pigeons, with the secondary name of Rameroon as opposed to Dr. Roberts use of
Rameron. In neither case are they referred to as doves, but as the largest South
African pigeon.
The only Lemon Doves I am aware of are the five species found ranging from the
Cameroon to the Genduru Mountains-- Aplopelia simplex inornata, A. s. plumbescens,
A. s. poensis, A. s. hypoleuca, A. s. simplex --and the A. principalis which is restricted to
Principe Island. Unlike the Rameron Pigeon, these doves are visibly sexable as the
female's under-tail coverts differ in colour from those of the male bird.
I can see no reason for confusing the two species for, not only are they entirely
dissimilar in colouring, but the Lemon Doves are only about eleven to twelve inches
in total length whereas the Rameron is sixteen to eighteen inches.
As a point of interest I have been advised by Mr. Denby Collins of Old Wharram,
Yorkshire, that he has successfully bred from a pair of the Ramerons I supplied to him
at about the same time as I sent some to Mr. Strann.

WING PATCHES IN FEMALES OF THE GENUS PSITTACULA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99716137037037" page_id="56317607"  page_num="186" year="" vol="">
In reply to Mr. Boosey's query about wing patches on adult Slatey-headed Parra- ;
keet females, I should first point out that the specific name, schisticeps Hodgson 1836, |
has been replaced by the prior himalayana himalayana (Lesson 1832). Two races are
listed by Peters, the nominate one and himalayana finschii (Hume).
Close relatives in the same genus are the well-known (to aviculturists at least) 1
Plum-headed Parrakeets, cyanocephala (Linnaeus), indeed, only last month an article
in the Bulletin of the B.O.C. suggested that another species, intermedia (Rothschild), is
in fact a hybrid between these two. In two of the three races of cyanocephala listed in
Peters' Checklist, the adult females have no wing patch, whilst in the third, rosa
(Boddaert), they have. On leaving the nest, the (rosa) young birds of both sexes are
almost entirely all green. At the first moult when about one year old, the heads
become grey and the wing patches appear to some extent in both sexes, it is still not i
possible to distinguish the sex. At the next moult the males develop their lovely i
rose-pink heads, whilst the females remain grey, but the sexes are clearly different, &amp;apos;
yet both sexes have a patch on the wing : unlike the females of the two western forms, i
It therefore seems quite possible that a similar characteristic is to be found in the ;
closely allied himalayana. The nominate race, ranging from India to Western Assam, f
having females lacking any patch, whilst the easterly race finschii, ranging from ji
Eastern Assam, Yunnan, Laos, and central Annam, have hens that develop a wing j
patch.
Earlier this year several Hodgson's Parrakeets were on offer from the trade--how 1
they got in is a matter for conjecture--but they were, in fact, Psittacula himalayana j
finschii, it may be that Mr. Boosey has obtained some of these instead of the more |i
usual himalayana.
It is doubtful whether this particular point has been clarified in Indian Ornithology, j
and I have not yet had the opportunity of searching through more recent literature,
but this seems a more likely solution to the problem.
