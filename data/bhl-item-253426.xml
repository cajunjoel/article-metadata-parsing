The Medal may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee to any
Member who shall succeed in breeding, in the United Kingdom, any species of
bird which shall not be known to have been previously bred in captivity in Great
Britain or Ireland. Any Member wishing to obtain the Medal must send a detailed
account for publication in the Magazine within about eight weeks from the date
of hatching of the young, and furnish such evidence of the facts as the Executive
Committee may require. The Medal will &apos;be awarded only in cases where the
young shall live to be old enough to feed themselves, and to be wholly independent
of their parents. No medal can be given for the breeding of hybrids, or of local
races or sub-species of species that have already been bred.
The account of the breeding must be reasonably full so as to afford
instruction to our Members, and must appear in the Avictjltttral Magazine before
it is published or notified elsewhere. It should describe the plumage of the young,
and be of value as a permanent record of the, nesting and general habits of the species.
These points will have great weight when the question of awarding the Medal
is under consideration.
In every case the decision of the Committee shall be final.
The Medal will be forwarded to each Member as soon after it shall have been
awarded as possible.

(Malaconotus cruentus gabonensis)
By C. S. Webb
This beautiful Bush-shrike is found in the Cameroons and Gaboon,
and the specimen shown in the accompanying plate was caught in the
former of these territories.
Like the other members of its genus, this Shrike is a formidable
looking creature having a longer and stronger bill than other Shrikes,
and the upper mandible terminating in a pronounced hook. In con-
sequence, great care must be taken in handling them especially when
freshly caught, as their bites are exceedingly painful and usually draw
blood.
Although distributed over a fairly wide area they seem to be every-
where scarce and on account of their secretive habits it is very seldom
that they are seen. The Malaconotus Bush-shrikes are found singly
or in pairs and they seem to recognize one another's territorial rights
as I have never come across more than one pair in any fairly large
area.
Not many of the West African natives of my acquaintance were
familiar with these birds, which is no doubt due as much to their powers

J. Delacour--Breeding and other Notes from Cleres
of concealment as to their rarity. It would certainly be possible to
live a long time in the West African bush without knowing they existed,
if one were not familiar with their call-notes. They spend nearly all
their time in dense impenetrable thickets where they catch beetles,,
grubs, and other insects on the branches, also tree-frogs. The call-
notes are varied and mainly harsh, the commonest being exactly
like the croak of a frog.
These Shrikes are very courageous and I once came across a pair in
a very agitated state making a big commotion. A large snake had caught
their fully fledged young one and they were continually swooping:
down in an effort to save the unfortunate victim, but without success.
I quickly killed the snake only to find that the young bird was dead..
After I left, the parents immediately returned and viciously attacked
the dead reptile.
In captivity the Fiery-breasted Bush-shrike does not retain the
scarlet colouring of the breast feathers. Like many other birds with
red in the plumage, these parts become much lighter and yellowish
after the first moult.
This is the first importation of the species but another member of
the genus, the Grey-headed Bush-shrike (Malaconotus poliocephalus)
which is somewhat similar except for the breast feathers, has been
brought from Portuguese East Africa.

By J. Delacour
Like every other year, 1935 has had its good and bad points, the
worst of them being the very sharp frost that we had in mid-May,,
which did a lot of harm : many Pheasants did not lay their second
or third clutches. Pigeons were put back several weeks, as well as-
small birds. Some delicate birds were injured by this unusual cold
spell and even a Grey-backed Trumpeter, which probably roosted up
at night on some cold stone or iron bar, had its toes frost-bitten.

On this account, the breeding results of certain birds were very-
poor this year. Although I have some fifty different species of Pigeons
and Doves, only a few reared young and most of them late in the
season. Crested Pigeons, Long-tailed, Jobi, Red-mountain, Talpacotis,
Senegal, Pigmy, Blue-headed, and Galapagos are the only ones which
were successful.
In the outdoor aviaries, we had a number of young of the Forest
Foudij ( Foudia omissa), the rarer of the two red Madagascar Weavers,
larger, with the abdomen greyish olive, the head, neck, back, breast,
and tail-coverts only being scarlet. Also, for almost the first time in
the fifteen years that they have lived in their aviary, Pekin Robins
reared a brood of four, and perhaps more, as nests were overlooked,
and they seem to be now so much more numerous than before.
Some Whydahs and Weavers also nested, but I do not know quite
which species actually succeeded.
Japanese Blue Magpies ( Cyanopica cyana) nested several times,
but always ate their eggs.
My pair of Lidth's Jays gave us hope at a certain time, but they
did not go any further than carrying sticks. They are very tame and
amusing, and I think the most beautiful members of the Crow family
in spite of their rather dark hues.
A few pairs of the pretty Fischer's Whydahs were brought to me
from Abyssinia last spring, the males in full colour and perfect condition.
They have done very well out of doors. At the end of November, the
cocks still are in full colour. I keep these Whydahs, as well as Queen,
Pintail, Steel, and Paradise, in large aviaries inhabited by various
Waxbills, Zebras, and Grassfinches in case the Whydahs may some day
lay in their nests, as they certainly are parasitic at liberty. Among the
new inmates of my outdoor aviaries, I should like to mention some
Pink-crested Touracous, Wood-hoopoes, Amethyst Starlings (which
are much hardier than supposed, and do badly indoors), some very
pretty Red-headed insectivorous Weavers ( Anaplectes melanotis), and,
thanks to Mr. Sydney Porter's generosity, some lovely Mountain Witch
Doves. Five Madagascar Partridges were reared by the parents.
The Pheasants were moderately successful. A good many of the
commoner species were reared, as well as some rather rare ones : six

Blyth's and three Satyr and Temminck's Tragopans, five Sonnerat's
Junglefowls, twenty-two Blue Crossoptilons, four Mikados, seven Grey
and two Bronze-tailed Polyplectrons, two Imperial Pheasants, and
three Bheinarte's Argus. I find these last birds quite hardy, but they
need much room. Many Junglefowl, some Silver Pheasants and Wild
Turkeys were reared at liberty. The Brush-Turkeys were tiresome at
first. The old cock, in April, chased away two young cocks bred in
1934 and forced them out of the park. They remained with two hens
for a time in the deer park outside, but all disappeared afterwards in
the woods. Three hens were left in the park with the old cock, who
insisted on building his mound in a most unsuitable place, right along
the main road. We disturbed him several times, but he insisted on
building there, so much so that we had to fence round the spot. He
then went back to his old nesting site in the wood, but it was already
late in June. However, he worked hard and two hens laid in the nest.
Young began to appear at the end of August and were still hatching
late in October. Several were found dead, but about eight or ten have
been fully reared.
Some Madagascar Guinea-fowl were foolish enough to bring out a
huge brood at the end of October. All died within two days of course.
They had not laid earlier in the year ! Three Demoiselle Cranes and one
hybrid Australian and Eastern Sarus were reared. White-necked and
Stanley's had two infertile clutches each.
For years I have had two female Manchurian Cranes. I was able to
exchange one for what I hope is a cock, and another one arrived from
Corea so with luck I may some day breed that wonderful species.
White Rheas did very badly indeed, and we never had such bad
luck with them for many years : only two were reared. We had lost
our two best hens in the spring, and the cold spring no doubt upset
the others. My old cock Darwin's Rhea killed a White hen put to him.
I fortunately have now secured six fine semi-adult imported birds of
this rare and attractive species.
Waterfowl were quite satisfactory in 1935. Some 400 were reared,
which is not a bad result when one realizes that there are between
2,000 and 3,000 birds here of about 600 species, belonging to the most
varied groups. And all need looking after carefully ! The Swans, however,

did badly. For some unknown reason, a pair of Black Swans, which
regularly rear five cygnets every spring, had only two. The old pair
of Black-necked were disturbed ; I had the silly idea to put another
pair on the lake in sight of their pond ; accordingly, they were upset
and forsook two nests in succession ; late in May, after the other pair
had been removed, they hatched a chick which developed slowly and
will always be a poor specimen.
Geese, on the contrary, were successful: six Emperors, two Ross's
Snow, two Blue Snow, four Andean, five Blue-winged, four Ashy-
headed, and five Magellans were reared. A fine brood of five Ruddy-
headed were unfortunately destroyed by rats ; eighteen South African
and sixteen Paradise Sheldrake, and six Wild Muscovies were bred. One
double hybrid three-quarter Rajah one-quarter Ruddy Sheldrake was
hatched, but not reared. Among the Ducks and Teal, of which twenty-
five species were successfully reared, a few are worth mentioning. For
the first time in captivity, the New Zealand Shoveller ( Spatula glatalea),
which also occurs in Australia, was bred. Mr. Sydney Porter brought
home one male and two females last year and kindly lent them to me
in the spring. They were full-winged and were put into a duck-aviary,
50 by 25 feet, built over a pond of running water where Cotton Teal,
Spotted Tree-ducks ( Dendroeygna guttata, imported for the first time
from New Guinea), and a few small waders are also kept. Both Ducks
laid, seventeen eggs in all, which were entrusted to Bantams ; seventeen
Ducklings duly hatched after twenty-five days. The first brood of six,
treated like all other closely related ducklings did well for a week, then
died one after the other, till only one was left; this was reared but
got killed by a rat later on. The second brood of eleven were specially
treated and did well at first but, again, losses were heavy after a
fortnight and finally six only reached maturity. It is no doubt a very
delicate species for the first few weeks of its existence, but it is fairly
certain that we can establish it, now that we know that it requires
special care and feeding.
We also fully reared eight Versicolor Teal out of eight eggs laid on
an island in the lake by a female imported last year. This pretty
species was bred many years ago, I think, but this brood seems to be
the first to be reared in captivity for the last thirty or forty years.

A. C. Furner--A Derby Member&apos;s Aviaries
Eider Ducks laid and one young was reared, but it met with an
accident later on. Brazilian and Chilian Teal also bred. All my Sea-
ducks are doing very well. Scoters, Velvet Scoters, Long-tails, Common,
and Barrow's Golden-eyes, Harlequins, on the little lake of some three
acres, overcrowded with over 300 waterfowl, and fed on grain and
soaked dog biscuit only, live perfectly happily. Some of them have
been there from six to ten years. Besides the Spotted Tree-ducks,
some good new Ducks came to Cleres this year ; several pairs of Bajah
Sheldrakes, brought by Mr. Frost, and a new consignment of White-
backed Ducks ( Thalassornis ), Hottentot Teal, and African Pigmy
Geese, which Mr. Webb collected in Madagascar. They arrived in
perfect condition and now are acclimatized in another duck-aviary.
These aviaries, by the way, are most suitable for small and delicate
Teal, and look extremely pretty.
In a further article, I will give some news of the birds which live
in my tropical houses, which I increasingly think by far the best way
to keep and breed all the more delicate species.
A DERBY MEMBER'S AVIARIES
By A. C. Furner
Only in view of our Editor's request and the fact that one must
realize her difficulty in obtaining matter for the Magazine at this
time of the year am I presuming to write the following notes on the
results of my bird-keeping for 1935.
To give Members some mental idea of the layout of these aviaries
I am enclosing with this article one or two snapshots which the Editor
might care to censor, and publish which she considers the best.
The collection comprises the usual Bed-rumped Parrakeets,
Cockatiel, Bosellas, varying species of Lovebirds, and one or two of

went to the nest in May, and due to the period of cold weather the
hen was found at the bottom of the aviary with the old egg-binding
trouble and had to be taken into the warmth to save her life. This
stopped further activities for a matter of three weeks when they went
to nest again and brought out three young hens ; all of which are doing
well aud are scarcely recognizable from their mother. These birds
went to nest again in August and for some reason unknown deserted the
youngsters at about ten days old and I found them all dead in the nest.
The Cockatiel which occupy two of my aviaries are a subject about
which I hesitate to write, estimating that from the first time I purchased
a Cockatiel about twelve years ago to this season I have spent just
over #100 on replacing casualties without ever having reared a single
youngster.
I am quite sure to experienced readers the cause will undoubtedly
be put down to bad management, although not one but dozens of my
avicultural friends have seen the conditions under which these birds
have been kept, and the only encouragement is that do one can under-
stand why I have been unable to breed them.
We have had young in the nest on dozens of occasions and the
parents have refused to feed them. We have had eggs within a day of
hatching and the parents have deserted. We have had young in the nest
and either the cock or the hen bird has died, causing the other to desert.
In fact I think I am right in saying that every possible kind of misfortune
has happened in my aviary in connection with Cockatiel.
As a few years ago I wrote my misfortunes to the Magazine I will
not bore my readers with a repetition of them.
This year at long last out of two pairs, three very good birds
have been reared and are doing well. The pair of birds who reared them
are really outstanding parents in appearance and feather, but their
first attempt of the season was with the usual luck, that the birds were
hatched and after four or five days were deserted and I found the young
dead on the floor of the aviary.
From subsequent results it is almost proved that the Cockatiel
were blameless but that a hen Budgerigar had been the cause of all
the trouble, for we found her raiding other Budgerigar nests in the same
aviary and killing the youngsters.

Amongst the small Finches the only breeding success has been
Long-tailed Grass Finches who had two nests ; the first nest producing
three young, the second nest two. We had misfortune again here,
for the hen and one of the young birds were roosting out on the first
cold night of autumn and the following morning we found them both
dead on the floor. The cock bird has continued to rear and feed the
other one.
With regard to Lovebirds, although my aviaries contained three
Fischers, five Masked and six Nyassas, just to show their contrariness
the total offspring are represented by four hybrids, produced by a
cock Fischer and a hen Masked. If any of our members would kindly
tell me the name of a reliable person for sexing these birds I should
be grateful.
I did hear many years ago that there was a man who specialized
in such work, somewhere in Ireland, who was almost infallible, but
it has never been my luck to find anyone so gifted.
This year for the first time I have tried Pheasants. A friend kindly
fixed me up with a young cock Lady Amherst and I bought a hen
from Mr. Spencer. These birds started laying eggs at the beginning
of May and solidly continued to lay for about six weeks. I wasted the
time of several broody hens over a period of three weeks sitting on them
with negative results all round.
Since the cock bird has come into colour it has been noted that
there has been something wrong somewhere for there is a very decided
strain of Golden Pheasant, and I am wondering if this or the fact that
the birds were young accounts for the infertility of the eggs.
The Gouldians this year up to now have proved obstinate and are
only using their nesting boxes as bedrooms. When the nest-boxes
were first put in about July, out of the six pairs which are up for nesting
five of the hens were almost lost with egg-binding, and had it not been
for the services of a friend of mine who is an adept at breaking eggs in
the bird, I should certainly have lost at least three of the hens. The
failure with the Gouldians has been particularly disappointing inasmuch
as the year before last when only one pair was put up they produced
and reared fourteen youngsters.
Mr. Teague's article on Gouldians, published about 1931, has been

my Bible as regards keeping Gouldians, and I am firmly convinced
that it was this article which went a long way towards popularizing
the breeding of these Finches, and although amongst many of my
avicultural friends I hear of varied treatments being applied, when the
whole thing is boiled down it is practically word for word Mr. Teague's
methods.
Among the birds which we keep but do not try to breed may be
included a pair of exceptionally tame Black-headed Caiques. Of course
when I say I do not try to breed them I actually mean I have no hopes
of breeding them, for I believe to-day these birds have not been bred
in captivity. On many occasions my hopes have been raised by the
birds apparently pairing up and taking charge of a nesting box, when
the hen would sit in the nesting box for hours on end, but on going in
to investigate her only interest seemed to be biting the box to pieces.
These birds live amicably during nine months of the year, but the
late spring and early summer months they spend their time quarrelling
and fighting which assures me they are a true pair and still keeps hope
alive that one day, if I can find a sufficiently attractive nesting box
and site, we may get a little farther.
In the Rosella aviary we have about half a dozen Scarlet Bishops,
one Pekin Robin, and one Crimson Crowned Tanager which make a
particularly showy aviary when these birds are all in colour.
A tragedy occurred here which I mention as it might save similar
loss and be a warning to fellow members. I had been in the habit
of tying bundles of oats and wheat together and hanging them in the
aviary. One morning I found the cock Rosella, who had evidently
perched on this bunch of oats, literally tied up like Houdini. He had
apparently got his foot inside the piece of raffia fastening the oats
together and in struggling to get free had ravelled his legs up com-
pletely and had died from shock before I found him. The total
length of the piece of raffia with which these oats were tied did not
exceed 6 inches. He had apparently split the piece into several
shreds and these had wound round and round his legs.
In concluding I offer my apologies for writing an article with no
outstanding points of interest and no unusual breeding results with
details of how I produce such results, for, though I should like to be in

such a position, I am not, and I appreciate that, in writing this year's
workings, it savours more of failures than successes, but I trust that
my efforts will have the result of persuading some other ordinary
members of the Society to give some of their general everyday
experiences of the birds with which we are nearly all familiar.

By P. J. Lambert
Interest in ornamental Pheasants is steadily on the increase. It
is true to say that whereas ten years ago the numbers of fanciers
could be counted in their tens, now they are to be numbered in their
hundreds. The cause of this happy increase is not difficult to discover.
There can be no doubt that until comparatively recent years very few
people had the opportunity of seeing ornamental Pheasants, nowadays
there are far more opportunities of doing so. Again many would-be
fanciers were deterred from keeping them, thinking that large aviaries
were necessary if good breeding results were required. I will deal
with this matter later. Then it was found that Pheasants were most
friendly creatures and lived happily with small birds and in no way
interfered with the smaller occupants of the aviary. There are indeed
many advantages to be gained by running Pheasants with small birds,
they will consume all the seed wasted by birds that it will be readily
admitted are not very provident and perhaps more important still
they fill up a blank space in the aviary, viz. the floor. It is probably
true to say that half of the Pheasant fanciers in Great Britain to-day
keep their Pheasants with smaller birds, such people inform their
friends that the breeding results of both groups of birds are in no way
interfered with and so we find the fancy enjoying still greater popularity.
Perhaps one feature more than any other has caused many aviculturists
to introduce Pheasants into their aviaries. Many thought that
Pheasants were difficult to rear: that this is a fallacy has been definitely
proved. Year by year one hears of novices raising splendid broods

of Pheasants. It is not my wish to dwell on the commercial aspect
of the hobby but many have to consider this side of any hobby they
indulge in: that Pheasants do pay handsomely I have no hesitation
in most emphatically stating. There is never any difficulty of disposing
of our surplus chicks or adults, and at a price that shows a very definite
profit. I think these are the main reasons for the very rapid growth
of the fancy but it must not be forgotten that one of our leading weekly
avicultural papers, I refer to Cage Birds, has done a great deal for
us. It has thrown open its columns to any Pheasant news and by
giving public weekly notes on these birds has surely done much for
the fancy.
Let us for the moment dwell on one aspect that I have mentioned.
It has been said that Pheasants do not require large aviaries. For
many years I was under the impression that aviaries of considerable
dimensions were essential and I was in the habit of advising the
following area, 9 yards long by 4 yards. Then one heard of Pheasants
living happily and breeding well in much smaller spaces and I
determined to go deeper into the matter. I therefore wrote many
letters to my Pheasant-keeping friends in different parts of the world.
The replies astounded me. In America, especially, I discovered that the
aviaries recommended were almost miniature compared to ours. The
results of my investigations have forced me to change my views and
now I have no hesitation in recommending aviaries of about
4 yards by 3 yards. I could furnish many proofs of the adequacy
of such aviaries, I will merely content myself with giving an instance.
An American, who perhaps breeds more ornamental Pheasants than
any other in that country, tells me his aviaries are all of this size for
the smaller type of Pheasant, just a little larger for Reeves, Silvers, etc.
The results prove very conclusively that larger enclosures are not
necessary, furthermore he maintains that he has had better results from
the use of such aviaries. It may be argued that such a statement is
bordering on the ridiculous, yet I can give readers just one instance
of results that staggered me. I saw a Reeves cock and two hens
in an aviary of 7\ feet by 6 feet. Now I was tempted to open the gate
of that enclosure and release the Pheasants but those two hens produced
twenty-nine eggs and twenty-five were fertile and many of the chicks

were brought to maturity. I can personally vouch for this statement,
I remember the incident well because I bet this man he would not find
a fertile egg. It may be thought that I am dwelling on this subject
rather needlessly but it is important that fanciers should realize that
extensive enclosures are not necessary---most definitely they are not.
Surely it is a splendid thing to know that all Pheasants cannot
only be kept in a healthy condition in captivity but that their propaga-
tion is possible ? Of the numerous species that have been imported
into Great Britain and the Continent it is almost true to say that the
Bulwer's or Wattled Pheasant is the only one that has never been induced
to breed. Perhaps also some of the Crestless Firebacks have not bred
but in this case only very few specimens have reached this country,
but I do know of a few pairs that are now well established and it is
more than possible such will produce fertile eggs next spring. Captain
Scott-Hopkins has a very fine pair of Malayan Crestless: these look the
picture of health and likely breeders. Now that, further specimens
of the Bulwer's Pheasant have reached England we can hope that this
gorgeous bird will be propagated. Needless to say some species are
very much easier to raise than others. Silvers, Goldens, Amhersts,
and Beeves, also most of the Kaleeges present no difficulties whatever.
Actually in this category the Peacock Pheasants should find a place,
for to my mind they are as easy as Silvers. Again that magnificent
Pheasant, the Elliot, is not difficult but I cannot imagine this chick
being reared unless it can be given its liberty: it is such a wonderful
little forager. There is no chick that finds its own food to such an extent
and no chick is so independent of artificial food. I once had the
misfortune to put my clumsy foot on an Elliot chick; I examined
its crop and there was not a particle of artificial food present; I did
commence to count the number of insects but gave it up. Then we
have the large range of Fireback Pheasants: now these are certainly
more difficult to raise. They appear to thrive for about a month or
six weeks but then if great care is not taken of them they will " sadden "
and die. My friend Monsieur Malisoux can rear all the Firebacks quite
easily but I consider he is a law unto himself. I am glad to say that
he has not only joined the Avicultural Society but has promised to
write some articles for us. I venture to state that these articles will

stagger the Pheasant world. He has promised to send one very shortly
so we shall have but little time to wait and then let me be allowed to
retire gracefully. Then the Tragopans and Indian Monal: personally
I am of the opinion that the latter are more difficult to rear than the
former. Possibly the principal secret with Monals is to keep them from
getting wet (this of course does not apply to adults) and also a larger
proportion of insect food is necessary. As for Tragopans one almost
feels that they can be reared on nothing but green food: most certainly
lettuces form the largest part of their daily diet. The Cheer Pheasant
has now been reared in England and my friend Mr. Stallard is to be
congratulated on this achievement.
Looking at the matter from a broad viewpoint, I maintain it is far
more satisfactory and more entertaining to keep birds in captivity that
one knows can be reared, rather than those that it would seem impossible
to breed from. Admitted that many fortunate fanciers can afford
to keep rare birds with but poor hopes of rearing successes, when such
fanciers are successful, I can quite imagine that their hearts swell
with justifiable pride. But the average fancier is not able so to indulge
his fancy. Therefore Pheasant culture should make a tremendous
appeal to one and all. In case any reader may feel inclined to keep
a few Pheasants it will be advisable to make a start with such as Goldens
and Amhersts, for by so doing we shall immediately be in possession of
birds of surpassing beauty, the plumage of which will rank high
with any bird in the world. Is there a more colourful bird in the world
than the friendly little Golden ? Is there a bird of more entrancing
beauty than the Amherst cock ? Such species are the ideal Pheasants
with which to build up a collection.
It would be a mistake to think that Pheasants give any trouble
to the person looking after them. A simple feed of corn is all that is
necessary to keep them in good health. With the exception of a few
of the rarer species they are extremely hardy and would seem to revel
in cold and stormy weather: it takes a mighty gale to blow a Pheasant
off its perch in the outside flight. One has only to visit the aviaries on a
cold frosty night, and one would see a large proportion of the Pheasants
roosting outside, the frost glittering on their backs and tails, but
perfectly content. From this remark it will be obvious that only

very rough shelters are required. One wonders what objections can
be raised against this fancy: they form a group of birds renowned for
their great beauty and again I will say that the great majority are easy
to rear. They are moreover long lived. I personally know of a Reeves
cock that was hatched before the Great War and is still healthy and
happy--its tail length exceeds 5 feet. I know of a Golden cock in
the North of England that is over 20 years old.
In conclusion may I urge any aviculturist who is not ambitious
to raise any ornamental Pheasants to consider running a few cocks with
the smaller birds, such cocks will greatly add to the beauty of the
aviary and the occupants of same.

A TALKING SHELL-PARRAKEET
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98601195" page_id="56289454"  page_num="14" year="" vol="">
By Ralf H. Masure
In the spring of 1933, while I was engaged in a maze learning
problem with Shell-Parrakeets at the University of Chicago, my
colleague and I thought it might be wise to raise some of our own
experimental animals. An outdoor aviary was built and a dozen
pairs of mature birds were introduced early in June. Our efforts were
almost fruitless as none of the Parrakeets started breeding until
September and then only one bird was raised before the weather
necessitated bringing the birds indoors.
This bird has become a very talented and remarkable individual
therefore his life story should be interesting. On the second of September
he greeted the world as a small white egg ; seventeen days later he
really appeared as a bird, small, red, and naked, like most any altricial
bird, except for the tiny hooked beak. About three weeks later this
little bird, now completely feathered, was removed from the nest in
order to attempt hand raising. This undertaking did not succeed,
however, probably because the bird was too old. After being out of the
nest for almost twenty-four hours without accepting any nourishment
I placed the young bird back into the next-box where he was affection-
ately greeted and well fed by his parents. After spending two more

weeks in the nest-box the baby was removed and found to be able to
crack seed for himself. From then on, his contact with another of his
species ceased, and his education as a pet began. I had great hopes
for his accomplishments as I had handled him every day, since he was
an egg.
In a few days he became very tame, showing no fear of anyone,
and being quite ready to fly on one's head. This location still persists
as his choice of a " human perch ". He soon learned to sit on a
diminutive Parrot stand most of the time he was at liberty. Being
a small bird his&apos; capability of performing was limited but he did learn
to shake hands, walk up a small ladder, and jump through a hoop,
on command. All these tricks were taught by getting " Nicky 55 ---
as I named my pet when early m January it was apparent from the
dark blue cere that he was a male--to go through the motions desired
and then rewarding him with a bit of lettuce. It took over a month
to accustom him to lettuce, but he became very fond of it. Just about
that time he started his first moult, lasting about two and a half
months, which transformed him into a beautifully marked specimen.
Soon another accomplishment manifested itself. My father,
who had become quite fond of the bird, would go to the cage every
morning greeting him with, tc Come here quick, hurry up ! " After we
had the bird for about a year--this morning play continuing every
day--I was surprised one afternoon to hear the bird doing a lot of
jabbering that sounded like a Parrot learning to talk, and then suddenly
I heard a distinct " Come here " in a small burring voice. Up to this
time the only mimicking that " Nicky " had done was to " peep "
like our Canary. I was much astonished and only believed my ears
when several other people had listened and decided that the bird was
really talking. Later he learned to say, " Hurry up," and to whistle
the first few bars of " Yankee Doodle We hope he may master
the entire song in time. This winter he has given us an exact imitation
of a person blowing his nose. This was acquired after several members
of the family had lasting colds. He also tries to sing like our Canary
but is not very successful in this.
He really is a charming pet, willing to demonstrate his vocal ability
at any time, his only drawback being that he has quite a mind of his

own and is difficult to get back into his cage once he has been allowed
out for a fly. At first a large piece of lettuce put inside the cage was
sufficient to entice him in, but now the room must be darkened and the
bird picked up in my hand if I wish to return him to his cage, otherwise
I must wait until be becomes hungry and returns of his own accord.
Handling " Nicky " in this way makes him very angry because, although
he likes to perch on one's finger, he will never permit anyone to
touch him.
A COLLECTOR ON MELVILLE ISLAND
By Walter Goodfellow
(Continued from p. 324)
During March and April there was a great influx of birds I had
not seen on the island when I first arrived there. These, no doubt,
were migrating to the islands still farther north of Melville. One
evening incredible numbers of Swifts filled the sky, and remained on
the wing until dark. After that I saw no more. White-breasted
Wood Swallows ( Artemus leucorhynchus) came in great numbers, and
one evening filled my dead tree to its utmost capacity. It is strange
how these birds crowd together even when there is ample room on a
branch, though this evening they had an excuse for it. Sleek and
immaculate, they always suggest a bird moulded in plaster and coloured.
They are extremely graceful on the wing, and execute beautiful
evolutions. No doubt many of these remain on the island all through
the dry season, as I still saw many about at the end of May when
I left. Bee Eaters (Merops ornatus) also arrived at this time in great
flocks, although I had seen a few about when I arrived, and also
in Darwin. It is a pretty bird, but not so beautiful as the European
species. It has the same musical call note of all the family, and is
also a late feeder. In the evening they unite in large flocks and keep
on the wing over one area, but during the day they separate, each
one taking a stand on a prominent branch, continually turning the
head in every direction looking for passing insects. With graceful

flight they catch these on the wing, always returning to the same
branch, where they hammer them until dead. In Australia it is
called the Eainbow Bird.
The Spangled Drongo ( Chibia bracteata) is another migrant, although
a few had been seen before the great influx in March. Like the Bee-
eaters, they had their evening flight and were very quarrelsome with
most other birds. The Black-faced Shrike ( Coracina novae-hollandae ),
is a pearly-grey bird with a black mask, common all the year round,
both in Darwin and on the island, but far more numerous in the dry
season when the residents are augmented by migrants from the south.
It is rather a large bird, and bound to attract attention, as it frequents
trees in every garden. Silent, but very beautiful, it feeds chiefly on
insects, but I have seen it take berries.
The Broad-billed Roller ( Eurystomus orientalis) is possibly there
all through the year, but I can only remember it because of the great
numbers in March and April. During that time I was never tired of
watching them in the evenings, when forty or fifty flew about in the
sky over the camp until it was too dark to see them, and I had been
forced by the mosquitos to take refuge under the net. The bird
surprises one by looking so very much larger on the wing. The pate
blue disc about the size of half a crown is very conspicuous then, and
from this it gets its name, the Dollar Bird. When flying in a straight
direction it may easily be mistaken for a Pigeon, until it makes a
sharp turn or a steep dive. It is astonishing how rapidly they move
through space, as their flight does not suggest it. I never could be
sure, although I watched them carefully, that they were hunting for
insects at these times. I think it was simply for enjoyment. During
the day the birds himt singly from some tree commanding a good
view. They also roosted more or less singly. My dead tree was a
favourite place for one, or possibly two, on most nights.
When I first arrived I found the Laughing Kingfishers amusing,
and looked forward to their early morning greeting, but long before
I left I was wishing them anywhere but in my vicinity. This was
not the species we are so familiar with in the Zoo, but Leache's Blue-
winged, possibly a little smaller bird with very blue wings. The tail
is also blue in the male, and brown in the female, both barred with

black. They keep in parties of five to seven, and it seemed to require
that number to complete the concert, as each one takes up a different
note and key. I cannot imagine one making much of a show alone.
It is not a decided laugh like that of the other species, and requires to-
be heard to grasp what it really is. They started before dawn, but were
happily silent during the day, and when evening came they went at
it full force from every direction, and kept it up till long after dark.
A party of them roosted in a tree close to my camp, and I used to
pray that each outburst would be the last, but after a few more minutes
one tentatively gave forth a note to try to incite the others till they
all joined in the deafening concert again and again. This was then
taken up by other parties all around, and by others still farther and.
farther off. As I was forced to retire to the shelter of my net by 6.30, it
became maddening to listen to all this until perhaps 9 o'clock. A man
I knew in Darwin had four of these birds and I intended to bring
them home with me, but after I returned from the island I had no
desire to do so. These birds also retire very late. I often heard them
flying to roost after dark.
Macleay's Kingfisher ( Halcyon macleayi) was fairly common around
the camp, and exceedingly fearless. Several times when I was catching-
grasshoppers and small lizards for my ducks, a flash of blue swooped,
from somewhere and snatched the prey from almost under my feet.
It is a particularly rich blue, and has a white collar and breast. Occasion-
ally I saw a still more beautiful Kingfisher, a perfect jewel of a bird,,
and although I call it Alcyone azurea, it does not seem quite to fit
that species, as my bird had no white on the forehead and throat.
This little gem had the whole of the upper parts a deep sapphire blue
and rich chestnut breast. Several times a pair flew through the camp
beneath the bark roof, and once alighted for a second on a chair beside
where I was standing. Although this belongs to a fish-eating genus, I
suspect they eat other things as well, for I saw them in the roots of
low bushes near the ground.
I saw no Finches on Melville, although they must have been there,,
and it was the time when the grass seeds were ripe, too. The Long-
tailed Finch ( Poephila acuticauda) was very common around Darwin,
on the mainland when I arrived there ; also Zebras, Bichenos, and not

a few Star Finches, the last often trying to get into the aviary to the
other birds at the back of the hotel, and likewise at various other
houses where they kept birds in the town. All these Finches were
to be met with any day along the grass-lined roads, and on every
vacant plot and telegraph wire. I also saw G-ouldians, but these were
birds escaped from captivity.
Emus were unknown on the island. I saw young ones brought
into Darwin in late June which could not have been more than a few
days old.
During the wet season frogs kept up a great racket all night, but
after the rains ceased nights were very silent except for the howling
of dingos. Sometimes for several nights in succession, a Boobook
Owl frequented the camp. Its queer call of " Mopoke " uttered in
rather a deep human voice sounded very uncanny, especially as at
that time I had seen no human being for five days, and later for ten
whole days. The Bathurst blacks had come over and were fighting
with the Melville islanders over the eternal female question, so all
of them had left my part of the island. When I did see any, they
came in looking like demons in full war paint and heavily armed with
spears and clubs. Many people in Australia still think it is the Frog-
mouth ( Podargus ) which calls " Mopoke ". This bird has an absolutely
different call, which I know quite well, although I never heard it on
the island. The Boobook stayed around for a long time, especially
on moonlight nights. I often wished it would go elsewhere, as it called
from my roof and kept me awake.
The Golden-backed Honeyeaters ( Melithreptus laetiar) often came
to the camp in small parties. This is an exquisite little bird, greenish-
gold, black and white, the under parts being entirely white. It is
fairly thick-set, and between 5 and 6 inches long. They were
quite fearless, and allowed one to watch them at close quarters, as
they diligently searched every leaf for minute insects. It would make
an exquisite inmate for an aviary. This, and the Blue-faced Honey-
eater and the Bed-breasted Babbler ( Ponatostomus rubeculus) were the
three birds of all those I saw on the island I liked the most. I think
this Babbler should be called the White-headed, as this is the most
conspicuous feature of the bird apart from its strange ways. It is

rather a large bird with a long graduated tail, that spreads open in
flight, showing deep white tips on the underside. All the colours are
soft and blended into one another. The first time they came under
my notice, I heard what I thought was a pack of yelping puppies
approaching the camp, which changed into half-human maniacal
sounds, and again into growls, snarls, and grunts. I have never
imagined a bird making such queer noises before. The flock usually
consisted of about a dozen and when they came, perhaps twice a week,
they stayed around for at least an hour, searching methodically every
trunk and bush for insects. With their rather thin and slightly curved
bills they opened every shrivelled up leaf which generally yielded a
grub. They clung to the bark of trees, working up them sideways,
and at times hung completely upside down to reach some leaf ; while
others searched the ground and roots of bushes. When so occupied,
they were silent except for an occasional grunt or growl. They seemed
to have a leader who always kept ahead of the main party and led
them all round the clearing. All their movements were very graceful,
and it seemed remarkable how they could dig in the way they did
into rotten wood, and tear the bark from trees with such a slender
and inappropriate-looking bill. I imagine one alone would not be
so interesting to keep, but how wonderful say half a dozen would
look in a well-planted garden aviary, and what an endless interest
they would be.
There is one group I cannot pass over, the Doves, not that I am
in love with them, on the contrary. I am not a person usually irritated
by any noises made by birds, in fact I had always thought I could
put up with anything from them, but I must confess that two species
of Doves, the Peaceful (Geopelia placida) and the Bar-shouldered
(6r. liumeralis) almost drove me to distraction. Both kinds were in
hundreds, and there was not a daylight hour when the camp
was free from them, and at night the trees all around were
full too. Why one was ever called the " Peaceful " I cannot
imagine, except as a joke ; they are the most quarrelsome birds I have
met, continually fighting among themselves, indeed several times
both on Melville and in Darwin I picked up some with broken wings,
and otherwise injured. It was not this, however, that annoyed me,

but their continuous and monotonous call. G. placida started before
dawn with " Four -a-bob " varied sometimes with " Four-bobber,
Four-bobber 55 from scores of throats the whole day long. The Bar
shouldered's call was a deliberate " Coo-coo 55 with equal persistency.
The two species also fought each other. They were mating in May,
and that may have had something to do with it. Had there been
other human beings in camp to distract one&apos;s attention, it might not
have been so bad, but entirely alone for long days together it was
terribly irritating. I should certainly never care to keep either species.
Another much prettier Dove, and far less common, was Smith&apos;s
Bronze-winged Partridge Dove (Geophaps smithii). When I first arrived
every day small parties of three or four came about the camp looking
very pretty, with their conspicuous white sides and scarlet and white
faces. After the end of March they disappeared entirely. As these
birds are confined to the northern territory, they must have gone
back to the mainland where they are called the Squatter Pigeon. They
told me these birds never settle in trees. That may be true or not, but
on Melville whenever they were disturbed they always flew up to
the highest trees. I caught three, two cocks and a hen. Unfortunately,
someone kindly opened their cage door while I was on shore at Port
Said, and they all escaped but the hen, which I recaught, and which
is now in the central aviary of the Zoo Bird House.
I think it was the second day after I landed on the island at the
end of February that some blacks brought in two large light-grey eggs,
which they said were Jabiru's (.Xenorhynckus asiaticus). I don't think
I know the egg of this Stork, but I thought at the time they looked
very much like a Crane's, and suggested this to them, but as they
seemed to know both birds, or said they did, I let it remain at that,
although I did not buy them. After that many more were brought
in, always in pairs. The eggs had a polished surface, and were lightly
speckled with darker grey, except one pair which was entirely plain.
I am quite convinced now that they belonged to the Australian Crane
or Native Companion (Megalornis rubecundus). No doubt Jabirus
are on the island, although I never saw one, but Cranes were fairly
common. I saw quite a lot together on a swamp in the north-eastern
part of the island, and a pair lived in the immediate vicinity of my

camp and gave me endless pleasure. Every morning at sunrise they
flew off with their well-known call, only just above the tree tops, in
the direction of the coast. They never deviated in the slightest from
the same line of travel. I always watched for them, and if they were
at all late I found myself getting quite anxious, fearing they had fallen
a prey to the blacks. They must have slept in a safe retreat in a swamp
for the dingos not to get them. They returned from the same direction
just after sunset. Before the last of my two camp neighbours left we
had many arguments about them, as he was always anxious to shoot
one. In the end he went off before daylight, and returned with the
female which he tried to eat, but found unpalatable, although, as I
have said before, he ate everything the blacks did. The Catholic
Fathers on Bathurst later told me they considered young Crane a
delicacy. After the death of his wife, the male was inconsolable, and
for nearly a week was calling all through the night, and kept me awake
too. He was also late in starting off in the mornings, and returned
earlier than before, probably hoping his wife might have returned
during his absence. It was sad to see him going off alone every day.
Then came an evening when he failed to return, and I began to think
he had left my part of the island for good. This was not so, for two
or three days later he turned up again with a new wife, but not quite
such a fine bird as the former one. After that nights were peaceful
again until they greeted the dawn, and resumed their usual routine
of travel morning and evening.
One afternoon during April, a black came into camp with
a snake for me. I saw he had left his " lubra " a little way off in the
bush, and she appeared to have some rather large object with her,
so I went to investigate, and found it was a young Crane she was
holding by the legs. They were not at all anxious to make a deal,
but it was eventually secured for some tobacco and a piece of calico.
It was so weak and weary I had great difficulty to get it to stand on
its tottering legs, and its wings hung down helpless like a Penguins.
I put some spoonfulls of boiled wheat down its throat, and kept this
up at intervals for the rest of the day. It was very excited when it
heard the pair flying over at sunset, and answered them in its feeble
voice. I put it under a box for the night, and when I let it out in the

morning it was already much stronger and its wings tight to the body.
Although I kept my eye on it, it showed no inclination to stray, but
at midday I was obliged to leave it for a time to attend to other
things in my late neighbour's deserted camp, and on returning found
it had disappeared. Although it was a risk to leave the camp alone,
never knowing if any blacks might turn up who would quickly have
stolen everything, I went off and searched the bush for nearly a mile
in radius, without finding a trace of the bird. The bush was not
dense here, so it was possible to see a long way. Later in the afternoon
I went all over the ground again, still without any result. I then
thought it best to wait until sunset, when the Cranes passed over,
hoping the youngster might call out and betray its whereabouts.
When the Cranes came I heard no response, and had to give it up.
The next morning as soon as I had time, I was out again, although
I feared it could not have survived the night, as dingos had been
around the camp, still in vain. Later that afternoon, twenty-six
hours after it had disappeared, I was lying on my bed, and, on turning
round, I found the truant standing close by, with its head hanging
down, and looking very dejected, and apologetic. There is no need
to say that the first thing I did was to give it a good feed. I felt there
was no need to take further precautions, as I was sure now it would
not go off permanently again, and it never did, except when any
blacks came into camp it cleared off as fast as its legs could
carry it. Up to the last it had the greatest fear of the blacks, and
seemed to sense their presence before I could see them. Daily it grew
more domesticated, and began to take a great interest in one's doings
about the camp, when I began to understand why they were called

As I have already said, I was once ten days without seeing another
human being, and during that time I often wondered what many men
placed like myself would have felt without any livestock to keep
them company. Truly these creatures can be a great comfort to one.
The result was I never felt really lonely, as my livestock kept me far
too busy to have much time to think about anything else.
I have never kept a young Crane before, and now I have quite lost
my heart to them. Their every attitude is grace itself, and were I a

bird artist I am sure I should revel in sketching them in every possible
position, especially if I had a tame one living with me, involuntarily
posing for me all day long. My youngster grew apace rapidly, too
much so for my peace of mind, and I began to wonder how I should
transport it from the island. To me there always seemed something
rather pathetic when it stretched its baby wings and pirouetted about
the floor. Although I am sure it was happy, I resolved that I would
always do all I could to keep it so as long as it was in my possession.
It was still fed on wheat, and for the first few days this was put down
its throat with a spoon, but when I found it picked up the grains
dropped I let it feed itself. For a long time it preferred the wheat
boiled, but finally, before I left for the mainland, it was on dry grain
and all the live food I could spare it. One day in camp I found it
with a hideous centipede fully 8 inches long held in the bill, and
twisted around it. I got it away, killed it, and then let him eat it.
Another time it brought in a very beautiful legless lizard about a foot
long, of a species I had not seen before, a purplish pink, with a darker
line along each side. These lizards, apart from the head, look like
a snake. Another time it caught a poisonous brown snake in camp
2 feet long. This I killed and cut off the head, and the body in two
sections, and let him eat it.
The first plumage is a pretty blending of pale fawn and grey, and
until the tail grows a long fringe of grey down conceals it. The head
at &apos;first is yellowish red, in reality a thick down which gets rubbed
off in time. It scrupulously ate all the fledge dust and quill cases
as they came off. As it grew older there was generally quite a litter
of this where it had slept during the night. It was all picked up and
eaten first thing to the smallest scrap. As I could get no carriers to
bring me out, one of the Fathers from Bathurst, hearing of my predica-
ment, unexpectedly came to my rescue and brought his launch 50
miles along the coast, and so saved me that walk. I only had an
hour's notice to get ready, and it was just as well, for if I had had more
time to think it over I should have thought it impossible. By abandon-
ing all camp gear I was able with the help of the few blacks the Father
brought with him to bring out all my livestock. So we started off to the
coast, both of us carrying packs, and I, in addition, with a long-legged

Crane under one arm. We left the coast at 1 a.m by moonlight,
and I had to sit in one cramped position with the Crane across my
knees until 12 o'clock the next day. At the mission I had a small
house given up to me, where I lived for three weeks until the schooner
went over to the mainland. It was not possible at the mission to let
the Crane have its liberty, as there were too many savage dogs about,
and besides it was still very much afraid of the blacks. It just tolerated
the boys as far as the steps, and seemed to know they would not be
allowed further in, besides they brought him many frogs and lizards.
Once they brought a half-grown rat in a cage, and when I had killed it
I laid it on the floor for a secocd, and on turning round found only a
portion of the tail protruding from his bill. It was a tight fit to get
down, but with a little massage we managed it. Eats after that were
always cut up in joints. He disliked very much to be left alone, and
called loudly all the time. When it happened at night, his greeting
of " cheep, cheep " was quite different from that in the daytime. He
knew my footsteps in the distance, and was always waiting at the
door. He slept close to my bed at night, and never failed to make a
friendly noise whenever he heard me turn over. When settling down
for the night he purred very much like a cat. He got greatly excited
when we had one or two slight showers ; with wings outspread he ran
from end to end of the room. Most days I used to sprinkle him, but
water was too scarce to use much. I found this necessary or the
young growing feathers came defective and broke off. He ate large
quantities of very coarse grit, and much green food, particularly
the leaves of sweet potatoes. At first I only had a shallow tin for
his drinking water, but he soon found he could scoop it up much
better by sitting on his knees. When sleeping it is curious how flat
and invisible Cranes become, with legs doubled under and head tucked
back under the feathers. Judging by this one, Cranes are not quite
so fond of being petted as Cassowaries, but perhaps if taken very
small they might be. There is one disadvantage in having a long-
legged bird about the place, they can reach too far over a table, and
one does not always remember to put things out of reach. They are
not quite so bad in this respect as Cassowaries, who bolt a thing on
sight and reflect afterwards. If a thing does not suit a Crane's palate

it drops it. I noticed the blacks on Bathurst called my bird a Jabiru
or a Native Companion indiscriminately, so I think there is no doubt
the eggs brought in on Melville really belonged to the latter, as I
expected at first.
Three days before leaving for Darwin the blacks brought in another
young Crane, a female, so I had a true unrelated pair. The crossing
to the mainland was very rough with spray coming over all night.
This did not suit the Cranes sitting by my side where I lay on deck.
First they got their heads under my blankets, and ended by getting
entirely underneath, but by the morning we were all wet through,
blankets and all.
I found conditions very changed in Darwin. The dry season was
on, and everything was burnt up and dusty. Many of the birds,
numerous before about the place, had left or only occasionally seen.
Others had come in to take their place, the most noticeable were
Kites and Pied G-rallinas ( G . cyanoleuca). The sky was literally full
of the former all day long. In the wet season I had not seen one,
but even more conspicuous were the Grallinas, ## pee-wees," or " magpie
larks " as they are variously called. Seen on their native soil in that
brilliant sunlight they look very different from what we know them
over here. Their plumage has a marvellous lustre, like black and
white satin. The inhabitants say they know when the wet season
has finished by the arrival of these birds. They were in scores in the
main streets, and in every garden and back yard, scarcely troubling
to get out of one's way. They even came in at the doors of houses
and seen omnivorous. They were very fond of bathing whenever
they found a drop of water. I noticed them waiting about the gutters
leading from the bathrooms at the hotel, sometimes as many as fifty.
Whenever a bonfire of garden refuse was started they came from
every direction, and waited around for any insects to come out. It
was quite a curious sight. It seemed to be a pastime with them to
chase the Kites and other large birds. I remarked they always kept
well above the Kites and made repeated dives at them. In flight they
have rather a harsh call, but when sitting in trees they often surprised
me with their sweet warbling song. Like many other birds, they like
to take an evening flight. This is rather heavy flopping, but relieved

with many graceful dives. Their extraordinary tameness certainly
makes them an immense attraction to the place in the dry season.
In July a man brought in a young Jabiru, the queerest-looking
little chap imaginable, a study in grey down. I am sure it would
have been a delightful bird to rear, but I already had so much to look
after I resisted the temptation with many regrets, besides it was
another long-legged bird, and very, very young.
A man in Darwin was breeding hybrids between the Pictorella and
Chestnut-banded Finches. He had two or three broods all very much
alike, but I thought none as pretty as either of the parents. Ho one
could have mistaken their parentage. He also had the first living
Yellow-faced Gouldian I have seen. I don't know if it is a fact, but I
was told that all yellow-faced birds are cocks. This one was, and he had
it paired with a very light red-faced hen .
In an article like this I can only attempt to mention but a fraction
of the birds seen on Melville Island, but I think a good estimate may
be formed of the interesting birds to be found on that far outpost of
the wonderful Australian continent.

morning which they pick at, and it appears to suit them, as I have
had no intestinal trouble with them. They like an occasional small
worm. They are very tame compared with the other species, and
use their mandibles to scratch up the earth. I have not noticed them
scratch with their feet yet.
17 th August .--The Cheer chicks are growing well. I had to kill
one with groggy legs, but the remaining six are fine. In colour they
are similar to the old birds, but have a white bar across the wings;
this is growing out as they develop. I am still feeding them on baked
custard for the last feed, and they appear to expect it before they
go to bed. It certainly does keep them growing.
For the first feed I give biscuit meal soaked, and midday small
wheat, with a portion of canary seed and millet, and plenty of lettuce.
7 th October .--The Cheers are going great guns ; I almost see them
growing. I understood that Cheers habitually sleep on the ground,
Grouse fashion, but all six of these chicks perch at night. This may
be due to the occasional presence of rats, otherwise the impression
that they do not perch is erroneous.
It is rather difficult to sex them yet, but one is definitely a cock,
showing the grey neck feather ; probably a second is also, four have
the appearance of hens, browner and not such long tails, the black
bars, too, are not so far apart as with the cock. They are all showing
the vermilion round the eyes, and look almost grown up.
I stopped giving them baked custard for a few nights, but they
appeared to miss it, so I have resumed this extra, and they
appreciate it.
I have had better luck with the Cheers than I had with the other
kinds, but this is probably due to the extra attention they have had.
Plenty of moving on to new ground, and so on.
When the hen commenced to lay she made a hole in the ground
sufficiently large to conceal her, less head, neck, and tail, and laid her
first four eggs in this, but as these were collected, leaving only one,
she laid the remainder, on alternate days, haphazard about the aviary,
where dead leaves were. The eggs were ordinary pullet size, putty
to greenish putty in colour and speckled at the broad end with
reddish-brown specks. Some were almost void of speckles.

By L. F. Stockwell
The Crow is the first bird acquaintance we make on landing in
India. He haunts the docks, the streets, and the verandas. Perhaps
the very first time we lie down for a siesta, we see him, or his mate,
sidle into the room, and snatch up a morsel of cake or biscuit left on
a plate.
Nothing escapes a Crow's eye and, as he likes bright and shining
objects, he often carries off a ring or coin, leaving some native servant
to bear the blame.
An amusing case was reported in the papers. A soldier, who had
lost his false teeth, was accused of selling Government property. His
story, that a Crow had snatched them from his hand while cleaning them,
was not believed till search was made in some Crows' nests in the
compound, and there the dental plate was found.
But Crows are sometimes taken in for all their cleverness. A Crow,
seeing some tennis balls put to dry in the sun thought they were eggs.
So he rolled one down an incline, then went back to fetch another.
But the elasticity of the balls annoyed him, for the harder he pecked,
the faster they rolled. His anger grew every moment as he chased them
with outspread wings. Then his mate flew down to help, and together
they at last collected all the balls in a hollow of the earth. But, when they
tried to pick them up, they found the balls too big and unyielding
for their beaks ; so, after many fruitless attempts, the birds had to
give up their booty.
The Crow that haunt houses are of two species ; the Grey-necked,
and the Black Crow or Indian Corby, and although the latter is some-
times found living in the jungle he prefers the neighbourhood of human
beings, where it is easier to pick up a living.
In spite of their thievish ways Crows do a certain amount of useful

service as scavengers, and for this reason a fine of 100 rupees is imposed
for killing one in certain cities.
Mr. Corvns is a disturber of the peace, for no sooner does the weary-
human lie down for a siesta in the heat of the day that the Crows make
their raucous voices heard in the veranda.
They are fond of holding committee meetings just outside.
I once saw a sort of Crow court-martial. About forty Crows stood
round in a circle, while three remained in the centre, representing the
judge, the complainant, and the accused. While the " judge " was
speaking the others kept silence, breaking out into a loud clamour at
the conclusion of the speech, as if debating what had been said. Then
the other two birds had their say.
Throughout, the " prisoner " looked most dejected, and once,
when the case seemed to be going against him, he rose and tried to
fly away. But immediately some of the others flew after him, and,
seizing him by the wing, brought him back to earth again.
Then followed a long and heated debate. The prisoner was evidently
found guilty, for, at its conclusion, they set upon him and tore him
to bits.
The Crow is not popular with other birds. He is greedy, and,
not content with keeping to his own hunting grounds, he likes to
snatch food from smaller birds. In spite of getting plenty of kitchen
scraps, he will fly off to share the Vultures' feast. When the annual
flight of white ants takes place, as they come up out of the ground in
myriads, the Crows gorge on them, robbing smaller birds, lizards, and
frogs. When the silk cotton tree opens its large crimson cups, the
branches are soon full of big, black Crows, drinking up the nectar at
the base of the flowers and ruthlessly tearing them to bits. The ripe
red berries of the wild fig tempt the Crows to compete with other
creatures. It is amusing to watch the striped grey squirrels seize a
fruit and sit up to eat it, keeping a sharp look out for the Crows, who
chase them along the branches. Then the squirrels retreat with loud
angry cries, dropping their titbit.
The Crow is deservedly unpopular, for not only does he steal eggs
from nests, but often kills the little fledglings as soon as they are hatched.
Sometimes, when caught in the act, he is mobbed by other birds.
The pretty swallow-tailed King-Crows, as they are called, are

sworn enemies of the big black Crow. Though no larger than Starlings,
they will rush out and attack him should he approach their nest, and
fight him with great bravery. The Big Horned Owl is also feared by
the Crows, for he picks them off their perch at night.
Crows roost together, coming from long distances, and flying home-
ward across the evening sky. During the solar eclipse of 1898, they
assembled at their roosting place, and, putting their heads under their
wings, settled down for the night. But, great was their surprise when,
after a brief interval, the sun burst forth again.
A gentleman who saw a young Crow with half a beak, adopted
it as a pet. The bird lived with him for thirty years, and would sit
on his shoulder during meals, sharing scraps from his plate. When this
bird was given more than he could eat, he would fly off to the roof,
where there was a certain loose tile ; this he pushed aside with his claw,
dropped the food in, covered it again, and kept it safely hidden till
required.
One tame Crow caused some apprehension to a superstitious lady
who was going home ill. As she took her place at table in a Bombay
hotel, the black bird solemnly perched on the back of her chair. When
she moved, the bird followed and took up his position behind her like
some fowl of ill omen. The Crow was a tame one, whose owner had
recently sailed for home.
Among uneducated Indians, Crows enjoy a certain amount of respect,
for they are believed to be the spirits of the departed, and for this
reason fly in and out of human houses. In some cities, trays of food
and chatties of water are suspended in the trees for the Crows. Some
Indian funeral rites also enjoin that food shall be freshly cooked and
given to the Crows.
Crows build in separate trees, the Mango for choice. Their nest is
a rough, clumsy-looking structure, hollow in the centre, but neatly
lined with hair and coir. In towns where all rubbish is cleared away,
Crows are sometimes hard pressed to find building material. One pair
robbed an optician's shop of 700 rupees' worth of spectacle frames,
which they cleverly worked into a nest. More wonderful still was a nest
shown in the Bombay Natural History Museum composed of iron
wire--the refuse of railway fences. The birds must have worked hard
with beak and claw to bend it to shape and make quite a neat nest.

Correspondence
Crows usually build iu May so that their fledgelings may be ready
when the first burst of the monsoon brings forth a host of lizards,
frogs, and insect life. But sometimes the rains are so heavy that the
nests and young birds are washed away.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
NOTES. O.P.S.
As a step towards encouraging the culture of Ornamental Pheasants,
the O.P.S. have arranged to show Pheasants at the forthcoming Crystal Palace
Show. Entries are open to any member who cares to take advantage of the
facilities that have been afforded by us.
As this is the first occasion that such an undertaking has been attempted,
we have made only three classes, viz. Goldens, Amhersts, and A.O.V., all
male birds, of course, If this Show is supported by members as we anticipate
it will be, we shall hope to extend the classes next year. Moreover if everything
goes off as we hope, we shall approach other big shows with a view of supporting
such shows with our patronage and a guarantee from financial loss as a result
of giving distinct classes for Pheasants.
I think the members of your Society will agree that the steps we have taken
will be the very best method of calling attention to these very lovely birds.
Readers of this Magazine are perhaps unaware of the fact that the O.P.S.
have made arrangements with your Society for a copy of the Magazine to
be forwarded to me every month. This copy will be at the disposal of any mem-
ber of the O.P.S. who cares to borrow it.
We think that it will become very popular and that the pages will be well
read. By having an opportunity of reading the Avicultitral Magazine our
members will we hope become so interested in its perusal that many will
join the Avicultural Society.
When Christmas is over we are hoping to attempt our first issue of a
booklet or magazine. Up to the present we are not in a position to say whether
this publication will take the form of a yearly, half-yearly, or quarterly issue,
so much depends on the support the Society receives. But we shall hope
to make it an interesting little booklet as we shall encourage our members to
give their own experiences in keeping and rearing Ornamental Pheasants.
So in a sense we shall take our cue from your Magazine, for if this is encouraged
it will be far more interesting to our readers than regular articles by experts.
We realize that we have not a Porter, a Goodfellow, or an Ezra, but we
hope that time will prove from a small beginning we shall be able to compile
a publication of great interest to all Aviculturists.
So many fanciers who may read these notes are surely interested in
Pheasants even if they do not keep them. May I appeal to all Members of
the Avicultural Society to join the O.P.S. So here is my address and I shall
be so pleased to receive many more applications. The subscription is only

THE WHITE-EARED GRASSFINCH
(Poephila leucotis)

The White-eared Grassfinch (Poephila leucotis) appears to be so
closely allied to the Masked Grassfinch (P. personata) that it can hardly
be regarded as a distinct species, but rather as the representative of
that species occurring in the region of the Cape York Peninsula. In
habits and voice the two are alike, but P. leucotis is the more handsome
of the two, differing from P. personata in the lighter colour of the
chest, the richer cinnamon-brown of the upper surface and paler
shade of the under parts. The bill is also of a lighter yellow.
It is now many years since this beautiful Grassfinch was imported
to any extent. It has never been common in Europe, but in the early
days of this Society it was occasionally to be obtained.
The late Reginald Phillipps possessed some nearly forty years
ago, and published a very interesting account of their behaviour in
his aviary, in this Magazine for August and September, 1898. Several
nests were built, but no success in breeding was attained. Mr. L. W.
Hawkins was more successful, rearing two young in 1900, for which
he was awarded the Medal of the Society.

a single example which I possessed about 1898. It was a hen which
mated with a Long-tailed Grassfinch. A nest was built and eggs
laid, but one morning the hen was found dead on the nest.
It is very rarely now that any birds come to Europe from the
north-east of Australia, and hence the rarity of P. leucotis.

By C. S. Webb
As very little has been published on the bird life of Madagascar
in English, a few notes concerning my last trip there may be of interest.
For the benefit of those who have only a vague idea of the size and
situation of Madagascar, it is as well to point out that it is over 900
miles from north to south and over 300 miles in the widest part from
east to west. It is situated off the south-east coast of Africa, the nearest
point being about 300 miles away. It is a French possession. Although
comparatively close to Africa, Madagascar must have been separated
from it for millions of years as it has no representatives of any of the
w r ell known African fauna. Their place is taken by a large family of
lemuroid animals. There are no dangerous beasts at all, excepting
crocodiles, and even the snakes are not venomous.
Birds, of course, are not so restricted in their movements and so
many African forms and migrants from Europe are to be found in
Madagascar. Nevertheless there is a remarkable number of genera
peculiar to the island.
Apart from the railway which runs from the east coast to
Antananarivo the capital, and a branch line northwards to Lake
Alaotra, transport is very difficult in the greater part of the country.
Where there are no roads the usual method of transport for Europeans
is by " filanzana ", a sort of chair mounted on two horizontal poles.
Four natives carry this on their shoulders at a fast pace, and if
travelling any distance another four are in attendance to take over

when the others are tiring. The first four then " rest " by walking
close behind until their turn comes again.
As the main object of my visit to Madagascar was to collect water-
fowl, I made my way from the port of Tamatave to Lake Alaotra.
This journey is full of interest, especially when the forest region is
reached, as here the line passes through some magnificent scenery and
many of the trees are adorned with beautiful Angraecum orchids in
flower. On passing the forest, a large, almost treeless plateau is reached
in which Lake Alaotra is situated. The lake is some 25 miles long
and is bordered on three sides by hills of indescribable beauty. The
views of the lake from these hills are no less magnificent.
For the greater part the water is very shallow except in the rainy
season, and there is a very large area of reeds and swamps. Among
the reeds there are masses of beautiful blue water lilies, and a white
variety, which extend for miles. This enormous belt of aquatic vegeta-
tion is the home of many birds such as Porphyrios and the pretty little
Allen's Porphyrio ( Porphyrula alleni) which is plentiful, and several
varieties of Crakes and Pails. Of these perhaps Cuvier's Pail is the
most interesting on account of its curious shape. All these reed-dwelling
birds are very difficult to get even a glimpse of unless one sits quietly
in a canoe for a long time and even then more often than not one has
to be content with hearing their call-notes.
At dusk hundreds of the tiny Hottentot Teal ( Anas punctata)
come in from the open water to where it is very shallow and to swampy
places on the edge of the lake to search for food. Fulvous and Whistling
Tree Ducks are also very much in evidence at nightfall, wheeling round
in large numbers over the shallow water prior to settling. They can
also be heard at night making their way to the neighbouring rice-fields.
Pygmy Geese ( Nettapus auritus), the smallest and prettiest of Madagascar
waterfowl, usually remain in the areas where water-lilies are most
plentiful, as the seeds of these plants form their chief article of diet.
They are usually in pairs.
The curious White-backed Ducks ( Thalassomis leuconotus ) are to
be found mainly on the west side of the lake where the aquatic vegeta-
tion is several miles deep, and they seem to avoid the open water as
much as possible. They nearly always prefer to dive when disturbed

but if they do take to flight it appears as if a great effort is needed to
rise from the water.
There is one Duck--the Madagascar Pochard (Nyroca innotata)
which is peculiar to Lake Alaotra. This is rather strange as there are
several other lakes on the island.
Besides the Ducks already mentioned the Red-billed Duck (Anas
erythrorhyncha), Meller's Duck (Anas melleri), and the Comb Duck
(Sarkidiornis melanotus) are fairly common here. Mellers Duck which
is somewhat like a very large female Mallard is indigenous but the
other two are found in Africa also. The Malagasy, as the Madagascar
natives are called, are very clever at trapping all kinds of waterfowl,
and this is done with snares and with cage-traps made out of reeds.
I was particularly keen on getting a good collection of Pygmy Geese,
Hottentot Teal, White-backed Ducks, and a few Pochards. The two
latter were not difficult to cater for in captivity, but the Teal and
Pygmy Geese were more difficult. They were kept in large runs like
fowl pens fenced round with reeds fixed tightly together to prevent the
birds from getting out. Reed huts were also provided for newly-
caught birds to hide in until they became tame.
When waterfowl are freshly caught and kept in close confinement
they are better kept perfectly dry. This applies especially to
Hottentot Teal and Pygmy Geese. The runs and sleeping huts were
littered daily with fresh clean rice-straw and it was found advantageous
to provide feeding receptacles so small that the birds could not get
into them. Until I did this I had a lot of trouble with the Pygmy
Geese. For food the Pochard only required paddy, i.e. unhusked rice,
the White-backed Ducks were given paddy and boiled rice and water-
lily seeds at first, while the Teal were given duck-weed, millet, and paddy
ground into a coarse meal. The Pygmy Geese in this region are so
accustomed to feeding on water-lily seeds that it is essential to provide this
food for some weeks while gradually getting them used to small millet.
Wheat is unobtainable in Madagascar and the millet I used had to
be brought from Europe. To get a regular supply of water-lily seeds
I employed several native women who went out daily in canoes. The
average size of a seed-pod is about the same as a medium sized apple
and contains thousands of minute seeds. While the Geese were in pens

it was sufficient to cut the seed-pods in half as their bills are particularly
suited to digging out the seeds from their compartments. As these pods
quickly go rotten it was necessary to have the seeds scraped out and
dried for food on the voyage home.
All these waterfowl travel well in boxes with vertical wooden bars
in front, with the feeding tins outside, and with fine-mesh wire-netting
stretched across about 2 inches above the floor. This keeps the birds
perfectly dry, which they must be during transport or they quickly
go wrong in the legs.
It was found necessary to pad the tops of the boxes for the Pochards,
as before this was done a few dislocated their necks by flying up and
hitting the wood with their heads. I have never known any other Ducks
to do this and it was all the more remarkable because they were
perfectly tame and never made any attempt to escape.

Some other birds obtained in the vicinity of the lake were the
handsome Madagascar Partridge (Margaroperdix madagascariensis) , the
Button-Quail ( Turnix nigricollis) , Bee-eater [M crops superciliosus ),
Sovimangu Sunbird ( Cinnyris sovimanga), and the Madagascar White-

eye [Zosterops maderaspatanus) : most of these were plentiful in native
cultivations. There are many interesting species of birds in the forest
zone, but I was unable to bring home any of these, as I had no time to
go there and trap the birds myself, and the natives have no idea how
to trap arboreal birds. However, I will mention a few briefly. Some
of the prettiest birds are contained in the Coua family. They are
closely related to Cuckoos and Coucals but more closely resemble
Turacous in their bright plumage aud in their habits. There are many
varieties, nearly all of which are very beautiful.
The Vangas, whose nearest relatives are the Helmet-shrikes, are
represented by many genera and include one of the most striking birds
in Madagascar--the Blue Yanga ( Cyanolanius madagascarinus) . There
is another member of the Vangidse which is curious rather than
beautiful. It is known as the Helmet Bird [Aerocharis prevostii) and
has a large peculiarly shaped blue bill which contrasts with its black
and brown plumage.
Other beautiful birds inhabiting the forest are the Philepittas and
Ground Rollers which are Pitta-like birds.

My friend, Mr. P. J. Lambert, through whose kindness I became-
a member of the Avicultural Society, tells me that some of your readers-
might be interested in my answers to the two following questions :--
</bodyText>
<listItem confidence="0.9320069375" page_id="56289490"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
1. How do we avoid mishaps with the adult Firebacks ; that is ;
frostbite, poor breeding results, etc. ?
2. How do we prevent the young Firebacks from dying when about
two months old ?
I have a very strong opinion on these two problems, for I do not
consider that either exists. What exists really is two much more
generalized questions. One must state them as follows : (1) Are the
adult Pheasants properly housed in a logical manner in our aviaries ?
(2) While the chicks are growing are they also reared in a suitable
manner ? Oue must proceed methodically; first explain our problem,
then state the causes and finally offer suggestions, excluding everything
which comes out of the scope of the ordinary amateur fancier.
1. Adult Pheasants. In my opinion the way competent owners
manage their aviary Pheasants is good on most points. The food is
well balanced, the pens contain some form of shelter, which is partly
open and roofed. The aviaries are provided with shrubs and grass.
</listItem>
<bodyText confidence="0.992972" page_id="56289490"  page_num="40" year="" vol="">
But they are generally faulty on one point, the birds are allowed to
roost at nights. I anticipate the reply : " They do so in a state of
nature." Quite so, but the state of nature is an " ensemble " and
widely different from aviary life. Nature affords Pheasants the
proper amount and right type of exercise, food, etc. Confinement does
so only in a restricted degree. With impoverished health the aviary
Pheasants have to face a climate not exactly suited to them. A slavish
imitation of nature is often ridiculous and seldom compensates for what
is faulty in captivity. Let us take an example. Twenty years ago the
apes of the London Zoo were known the world over because they lived
so much longer than those of other zoos. Was that due to an
exceptionally high temperature such as that which prevails in the
tropics ? Had they had built for them enormous big halls with artificial
forests, where they could swing from tree to tree as in their native

haunts ? Were they sprayed with tepid water, ventilated with hot
air, and furnished with a bed of twigs near the roof ; to make a mock
imitation of the equatorial rains, the burning winds, and the aerial
sleeping places of the apes ? Indeed no. What saved the lives of these
apes was the glass that an intelligent management had put between
them and the T.B. germs of our country. This glass, everybody who
has the slightest notion of fresh air will admit, is not only unnatural
but most decidedly contrary to nature. However, it cannot be
dispensed with, as it acts as a barrier against this deadly disease.
Our damp cold and wretched climate are a continual threat to the
general health of our Pheasants. To talk of it is commonplace, but very
few people have studied it in a proper manner. My own experience
and that of others has suggested some remedies. The countries from
which Pheasants come, in other words their native habitats, can roughly
be divided into two groups. Those never cold if sometimes damp ;
others sometimes cold but never damp. We enforce upon our birds the
cold penetrating mists and fogs, the icy rains, the melting snows, etc.,
for which constitutionally they are totally unfit. Even what is known
as dry cold is not to be found in Western Europe, its nearest limits
are Central France and Switzerland. We must compensate our
Pheasants for the unsuitable nature of our climate, and not blindly
try to imitate nature, as this can only be found in their native haunts.
Truly every Pheasant roosts when living its own wild life, but it is
among the surroundings that God has provided and therefore perfect.
There is never an overdose of heat or cold, of damp or dry. Moreover,
they choose their roosts themselves. Our Pheasants have a very limited
choice among the perches and shrubs we place in the aviaries as we
happen to think fit. In my opinion it needs something much keener
than our common sense--our fitting a board here, a perch there, and
a shrub somewhere else--to succeed. In spite of our goodwill, our birds
are not half as well protected against the inclemencies of the night as
they would manage in the natural state. Concerning this subject the
experiences of two other people has impressed me. One is the Argus
hen of a very ignorant fancier. This hen was living in an aviary with a
roof, but otherwise open. Her toes had been severely frostbitten in
25 degrees of frost. Except for this the bird was in perfect health and

went on living in the same aviary for several years. I heard also of a
well-known French fancier who absolutely spoilt his Argus cock by
frostbite, the bird becoming infertile owing to a stiff joint ; otherwise
it was very healthy. This same fancier has since thought it necessary
to house all his Firebacks in the South of France.
In the meantime I was enjoying my own experiences and at my
own expense. My first rare Pheasants were of a delicate nature, viz.
Siamese Firebacks. I did not think they were delicate, there were
many things I did not know at that time. These birds were at least
four years old and the hen had never laid. I had seen them the previous
summer in the aviaries owned by&apos;the person from whom I obtained
them. He kept them in a pen, part of which was an open greenhouse,
where the birds were in the habit of roosting, the rest being open.
January and February were bitterly cold months that year. The pair
were sent to me in March. It was still freezing ; the cock was tolerable,
being only a little bitten with frost in its pads. But the hen would not
move unless frightened into a walk. The tip of each toe was missing,
but whether this was old or fresh frostbite I could not say, for I was too
much of a novice. The cock's wattles were grey and the hen's facial
skin was violet ; in fact, two poor specimens. I was in my innocence
expecting them to breed, naturally in vain. Not once did the cock
display to its mate ; not once did he drum his wings or blow his wattles
out. Once or twice only did he bully his hen, and that was in the month
of September and then a mere peck on its head, and at this time the
latter was walking about almost fully recovered from its stiffness.
Now, in the meantime, my mind had been busy. Why was it that the
toes of the Diardi were affected and also the Argus ? Why not the
lungs, intestines, and tender fleshy wattles that are not hardened
through constant contact with soil, mud, etc. Why the toes only ?
Indeed, I was puzzled. I surmised : " The body is heavily feathered,
the head is plunged into these feathers during sleep. The toes alone
gripping the roost, remain bare, for squatting during these sleeping
hours she protects the rest of the foot. Whether they freeze because
unprotected or because tender is immaterial. The point is to keep
them warm." And we tried. We commissioned the village carpenter
to make a cubic wooden box or shelter with good fitting boards, about

80 cm. in each, dimension. This box and its sloping roof were entirely
covered with bituminous cardboard to make the entire roof perfectly
damp proof. This box had a double bottom, to prevent the cold from
striking upwards. Furthermore, to avoid all dampness the box was
not placed on the bare ground but on wedges. Its floor was matted
with a thick 10 cm. layer of well-pressed straw. From 15th October
onwards the Siamese were placed in this box at dusk and let out next
morning at 7 a.m. This continued until the last spring frost was over.
This is what followed. In the spring of 1930 the hen, which was now
at least five years old, laid her first eggs, twelve in all. In 1931 she laid
thirteen eggs and every egg was fertile, but part did not hatch. We got
another adult cock and in 1932 the hen again laid thirteen eggs and
all hatched. In 1933 nineteen eggs and all hatched. In 1934 she laid
twenty-one eggs and again all hatched. Unfortunately the hen died
egg-bound with the twenty-second egg. A post mortem disclosed that
she would have laid six more eggs. Our next trial was with a pair of
1932 Vieillot Firebacks. These birds were not first brood, and their
owner dared not send them before the winter, as they were not fully
grown. Unhappily once he forgot to shut them up at dusk. It was
freezing and the hen got severe frostbite ; the cock, however, apparently
suffered little harm. Having been successful with the Diardi, we decided
to try again. Save for crippled feet, the hen was a good bird and heavy.
But next winter we suffered another setback. Our gardener cleaned the
box and forgot to press down the fresh straw, and this box was not
fitted with a double bottom. The hen dug for herself a hole in the straw
and we concluded that her toes rested on the bare boards ; anyway
the result was a slight recurrence of frostbite. This is why we strongly
advise that the box should be fitted with a double bottom and that the
straw should be pressed very tightly. When two years old this hen
did not lay--now, had her development been retarded by frostbite ?
The next winter was very severe, and we had four months of bitter
cold north winds. Twice daily fresh water had to be supplied to the
Pheasants, and a quarter of an hour later the water was frozen to the
bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, our Vieillots came through
splendidly. In the spring the hen commenced to lay and she produced
forty eggs, always on alternate days, each one at 7 p.m. ; all the eggs

were fertile, the chicks were perfect. The 1934-5 winter was again very
cold, but we had not the slightest trouble. In the following spring we
had forty-one eggs, Nos. 3 and 4 were infertile owing to a late and
untimely frost. All the chicks were perfect.
Such have been our experiences with delicate Pheasants in cold
weather. But one must not believe that hardier species do not suffer
from the cold. We noticed it again last spring. Out of Edwards and
Elliotts eggs laid during the late frosts some chicks hatched with crooked
toes, others were faultless. I may add that the parent birds were in no
way related, so we cannot say that the crooked toes were due to breeding
from related stock. My Elliot cock, indeed, is an imported and very
beautiful bird. It is never safe to generalize but in such a climate as
that of my valley (damp, bitter winds in winter, frost holding for weeks,
clay soil, etc.), I conclude as follows. If your Pheasants are long-tailed
and " cheap " then let them roost. If they are hardy and valuable,
force them to sleep on the ground. At this level, amongst grass tufts
and shrubs, there is very little wind and, moreover, the irradiation of
the night will make itself felt only on the upper parts of the birds.
But specimens either delicate or very valuable must not only be
prevented from roosting, they must also be compelled to squat on their
toes and bellies on a dry litter and shut box, and this every night through-
out the winter. In this way you will get better results from delicate
species than from hardier ones that are allowed to roost. You will get
more eggs and a high rate of fertility. The chicks will seldom hatch with
faulty toes, and will be easier to rear. Our experience is conclusive.
The Firebacks we so love on account of their beauty and because of
the ease with which they can be tamed thrive in this way as well
as any, if not better. Sometimes, indeed, we are afraid we shall lose
the hens as they are so wonderfully prolific.
To sum up. Delicate Pheasants must not be dealt with as game
but as the barnyard fowl, whose laying power is hindered by cold. I
can guarantee that greenhouses, roomy premises, and heating devices
are absolutely useless as far as aviary bred Vieilotts, Siamese, and
Bornean Firebacks and probably as far as Argus are concerned. A good
shut box with an ordinary door suffices. With it I am quite positive
of complete success. But this does not mean that good results could

not be produced with an open box. In this case the birds should be
compelled to sleep on a very thick litter of straw, perfectly dry, and
made of two different layers, the one below tightly pressed, the other
rather loose to enable the birds to squat in it.
I should be indebted to readers of this magazine who might have
made a similar experiment or would be willing to do so, and I should
be glad to know of the results. Perhaps I shall not be able to thank
them in such English as this article, with which Mr. Lambert has lent
a helpful hand, but I should be grateful all the same, and with me all
aviculturists I am sure. The establishment of one single fact is of more
value to this science than the enthusiastic goodwill which is generally
prevailing amongst all true aviculturists.
Readers who might want the design of a good and cheap box may
apply to the author of this article.

We have already said that there is no problem concerned with adult
Eirebacks ; a like remark applies to the chicks. There is a general rule
for Pheasant chicks of all species. They must be supplied with a certain
amount of heat until they cease to grow. During early " chickhood "
the fostermother hen (or lamp) provides the necessary amount and later
on the heat of the summer months is sufficient. But if the chicks are
late hatched the little summer left is all too short for them. The same
applies to the slow-growing species, and here I am referring to those
Pheasants which do not reach the adult stage until they are two or
three years old, even if not late hatched. In both cases the warmth
that the summer months has provided must be artificially extended,
otherwise one must expect to lose some chicks. The remedy is neither
difficult nor expensive. From a breeding point of view we roughly divide
our chicks as follows : (1) The quick-growing species, (i) early hatched,
(ii) later, (iii) late ones ; (2) slow-growing species, (i) early, (ii) later,
(iii) late.
For instance, a young Edwards hatched in July is treated in the
same way as a Fireback of the same age or thereabouts, or perhaps to
be more exact as a Fireback a little older because Firebacks grow
more slowly.

Y . Malisoux--Must Pheasants Roost ?
Theoretically a third classification might be made according to the
hardiness of the various species, but as it is practically of no use to the
average breeder we will discard it.
Here we must again repeat what was said about the adult Pheasants :
Pheasant chicks must also be dealt with as &apos;poultry rather than game.
No matter if the warmth is given by the hen or by a lamp (we use this
last system) the chicks must be able to warm themselves at leisure
until they are two months old, or three, according to development.
During all that period our lamp is burning day and night. When the
days are quite hot in summer we turn the lamp out for a few hours.
But we light it again if the weather freshens and in any case at sunset.
If the Pheasants belong to the quick-growing species and are already
three months old on 15th July, they will require no more extra heat for
the rest of their lives. But from the beginning of September onwards
we strongly advise a shut box with a good litter, this applies to slow-
growing species and even for a second brood of quick-growing chicks.
In September the nights can still be mild, but they cease to be warm.
Chicks hatched at the end of August or after must be heated all the
autumn and winter by artificial means.
We use an ordinary electric lamp, the sort with a charcoal thread
that does not give much light but is not fragile. I do not know the name
for it in English--[I am afraid I do not know the lamp to which
M. Malisoux refers.--P. J. Lambert.] 1 --but it is just what is required.
This lamp is fixed in an open box. These late chicks must be brought
indoors every night. They must also be kept inside if it is freezing
hard. A well-lighted attic or even a stable is quite sufficient for this
purpose. But they need their box and lighted lamp day and night.
As I write these notes it has been freezing hard for a month,
save perhaps for an odd day or two. It is 3 p.m. and in spite of this
4 Vieillot chicks, hatched on 18th August, are playing about as usual
in their small movable aviary in front of my window. When the grass
thawed this morning, about 10 a.m., they were brought down from
their attic. Their small box, which measures 30 by 40 cm., was fitted
to the aviary, its shutter lifted, and the lamp lighted. The birds are

scratching and exercising ; now and then they retire to the box,
obviously to warm themselves. They are the picture of health.
Five young Diardi female chicks were brought up in the same
manner last year. They were hatched on the 26th August. Not one died,
and we sold the last one this last summer. For health and size it was
not inferior to a two-year hen that we keep as a stock bird. [I can
vouch for this fact, as this hen is at present on my place.--P. J.
Lambert.]
I am quite sure one could obtain quite as good results with Bantams
or Silkies, provided the young Firebacks can be persuaded to sleep
with their foster-mother in a shut box and on thick litter before they
show the first propensity to roost. The chicks must on no account be
allowed to roost. I cannot understand why so many breeders rejoice
when they see their small chicks taking to roost for the first time.
This is the most dangerous period of the growing stage. The growth
of the plumage bears directly on the bird's health, and though the chick
may be too big to sleep under its mother's wing, it is still much too
young to hold the necessary warmth by itself on the roost, at least in
such a climate as ours. One has only to observe them to stand
convinced. If by mistake one of our chicks has been allowed to spend
the night outside on some roost of its own choice, we at once detect
it the next day and, indeed, the day after from the rest of the chicks
by its slower movements and loose plumage.
I am positive any breeder will succeed as well as we do with first
and second brood Firebacks provided he uses a shut box with ample
litter. For the very late broods I am not sure this would be sufficient,
because the Bantam or Silky might be unwilling to mother her chicks
through the winter during the day . At night when the box would be shut
her very presence would be sufficient as the chicks would cluster round
her. One could perhaps combine the two systems.
The only secret is to keep the chicks warm by compelling them to
sleep tightly clustered together on a warm litter and so prevert them from
losing their individual warmth though isolated roosting. Of course
ore must on no account heat a shut box, otherwise the chicks would be
suffocated. To sum up, the roosting is injurious to some adult
Pheasants, prejudicial to all chicks, and even deadly to many of them.

In the year 1932 the Berlin Zoo determined to acquire a little
collection of Humming Birds. We succeeded in keeping these tiny birds
in good condition by giving them cages and food according to their
need. Therefore we enlarged and completed this collection by further
importations so far as to be able to show about twenty Humming Birds
at a time in our Zoological Garden. Up to the present time we have had
specimens of the following species and subspecies :--*

which have been here for more than three and a quarter years, and
moreover quite a large number of other Humming Birds, which are
still in good health, have been here for more than one and a half years.
More details are found in the review in Gefiederte Welt, 1935.
The Humming Birds live in a large voliere and in three large cages,

up to a temperature of 20 to 22 degress of Celsius (60 to 72 degrees of
Fahrenheit). The cages are lit by lamps mounted at each side in order
to show off the varying colours of the birds. They are always decorated
with pots of flowers in blossom, which contrast splendidly with the
brightly-coloured birds. In winter the cages are lit until 8 o'clock at
night, so that the Humming Birds can feed till that hour. Then they
are not switched off all at once but gradually. Thus the birds have
time to look for a place where to sleep. Otherwise they would fly
about in the dark until they were totally exhausted, and then would
have great difficulty in recovering.
Twice a day they are fed. In the morning they get a mixture con-
sisting of three parts honey, one part Mellin's food mixed with water,
two parts cane-sugar, one part sweetened condensed milk, and a little
bit of Liebig's meat extract. This mixture is diluted by a double quantity
of water. In the afternoon they get another feed consisting only of
three parts honey and two parts cane-sugar, and also diluted by a double
quantity of water. This food is put into special bottles preventing the
birds from soiling and glueing up their feathers. Besides, the Humming
Birds daily get also a large quantity of small flies ( Drosophila ), which
they eagerly catch and eat and which seem to be absolutely necessary
to keep them alive for any length of time. These flies are easily bred
in large quantities. The humming birds either catch the buzzing flies
in the air with their bills, or take them off the walls with the help
of their tongues.
Daily the Humming Birds are sprayed with a flower-syringe filled
with luke-warm water. They like to bathe in the water, which after
the spraying remains on the leaves of the plants in their cages. Also
the sand covering the floors of the cages is always kept wet. By these
measures the birds' feathers are always kept in a good state.
When kept in this way Humming Birds do not seem to be more
delicate than many other tropical species such as nectariniae and other
honey-eating birds.
We hope that we in future will succeed in importing new and
interesting species of Humming Birds and shall thus be able to show
them to scientists and amateurs.

THE BREEDING OF JAMIESON FIREFINCHES
By F. Johnson

<bodyText confidence="0.987206848484849" page_id="56289502"  page_num="50" year="" vol="">
I made no elaborate preparation for the breeding of the Jamieson
Firefinches.
The hen I received in a small consignment of Waxbills from
Marseilles eight months ago. The first cock I put her with was bought
from a well-known London store, and survived about twenty-four hours.
I tried another one from the Continent, but he was dead within twelve
hours of reaching England. I secured yet a third cock, he also coming
from the Continent, arriving only half-clothed. I was so disgusted with
such a poor specimen that I took both the cock and the hen and threw
them into a planted aviary along with a lot of Waxbills I was preparing
for shipment to New Zealand. At the end of eight weeks the cock was
looking something like, and I noticed him a few days after come out
of a roller travelling cage that I had filled up with hay and hung up
in the aviary some weeks previously. As this particular aviary contained
over 200 Waxbills of various species, I decided to catch the Jamiesons
up and try them in a secluded aviary in which I had previously tried
a pair of Royal Parrot Finches. Both inside the sleeping shelter and
round the wire netting of the flight I had already nailed a fair number of
hazel-nut branches and amongst the branches in the sleeping shelter,
near to the window, I had hung only one wire nesting box. The four
months the Royals had occupied the aviary I do not thick they had
even looked at it, although I had half-prepared the nest and scattered
about moss, hair, and feathers, in the hope of inducing them to make
home. I finally sent the Royals to South Africa.
However, except for the floor of the sleeper being brushed up, the
aviary was left just the same and the Jamiesons were turned into it.
The first morning of feeding in their new quarters, out of the nest
flew the pair of them, and I thought to myself the best thing to do is
to leave them to their private affairs. I dared myself to peep into the
nest once a week. Little by little the nest was elaborately prepared
with all the shortest pieces of hay procurable and mixed with a little
cow-hair. At the end of five weeks the nesting wire was full and I never
saw either bird for five days.

F. Johnson--The Breeding of Jamieson Firefinches 51
As I had to return to business early the following week, I thought
it best to have a look to see what was really happening and on looking
into the nest out flew the cock. The hen would not move, although
I put my finger in the nest. I came to the conclusion that she was
egg-bound, and I made preparations to deal with it. On going to the
aviary to fetch her to the hospital out flew the little lady, and there in
the nest was one little cream-coloured egg. The noise of both the cock
and the hen made me realize that my place was outside, and not to
interfere with their family affairs, so out I went and I never went near
the nest for ten days. Later I found that they were setting two eggs,
and as the first was definitely laid on 27th August, 1935, I looked in
again 10th September, hoping to find the chicks had hatched out, but
this did not happen until 13th September, 1935. As I had made sure
both were alive, I left them severely alone except for feeding.
I gave instructions to supply them with twenty-four-hour soaked
Indian brown millet and small canary, and also live ant's eggs,
obtainable from the paddock, but the latter were never touched and
the youngsters were fed entirely on soaked seed.
I took the risk of looking into the nest at the end of seven days
and to my surprise found only one chick nearly half-fledged. The body
of the other was found on the aviary floor, its pin feathers just showing
through, it looked to have only survived about four or five days.
However, the remaining youngster continued to thrive and was seen
on the outside of the nest 29th September. On 5th October he was
fluttering about the branches in the flight with both parents joyfully
following him about, evidently very pleased with their handiwork.
I may mention that the youngster is a very strong bird, and both
parents and he are still outside (20th December) and going strong, and
I fully intend wintering them outside if possible.
May I mention that the F.B.L. representatives have seen the
surviving youngster which is still outside, and as I am endeavouring
to winter it outside I shall be pleased to show any member it, if they will
only make an appointment by ringing Hither Green 4257.

By Captain E. H. Barclay
This is my experience of keeping foreign birds of all descriptions,
and it has been a bitter one and hence I have given up all hope of taking
really an active interest in keeping up my aviaries, of which I was
very proud and keen, but there it is. In the first place I was persecuted
by rats, which diminished my numbers very considerably, and what
was more annoying it was generally the valuable birds that were killed.
Well, eventually I overcame that curse for a period of time, and in
spite of placing wire-netting under the ground these pests managed to
eat their way through this and eat their way through the entrance
door. What can a body do with adverse circumstances like this ?
Anyway, I grew more and more disheartened at these disastrous
results, and whatever preventive I attempted was frustrated by some
other disaster. My big disappointment was in the breeding season.
Then I had some Longtailed Grassfinches which did breed, but when
the young became mature they were destroyed by some of the other
inhabitants of the aviary. Then a species of mouse worked its way in
and played havoc amongst the birds, to such an extent that breeding
was quite out of the question. My experience is very bitter, and try
how I would nothing in the aviary seemed to do well. I will say the
first two years gave me every hope that I would have a very nice
collection, some of which I brought back from the Amazon (South
America)--Tanagers, etc. I put heating oil stoves in their shelter,
but do you think the birds will ever go into them ? Not on your life.
The only time they ever will is when there is snow on the ground, but
frost and real cold--not they. Besult, death by exposure. I don't
believe from what I have learnt that any foreign bird will live in an
open aviary unless it is built with thick glass all round, and then
nothing can injure the birds except hailstones or an earthquake ! !
The outside of the aviary is walled in all round, and plenty of shelter
and bushes, but the English climate is no good for these foreigners,
wherever they come from, I am convinced, no matter what you do.
If it is not the climate it is vermin, and I found with these to contend
with continuously keeping aviaries as a pastime was not for me any

longer. Another curse is--I put traps down to catch the mice ; this
did have a certain amount of effect till some slugs found the cheese
and ate the bait, and then, of course, no mice were caught. But if
any of your members can help me to overcome these disasters I should
like to begin once more. But for the time being my zest has gone,
as you will gather from this letter. But I cannot imagine how anyone
who writes articles in your Magazine, and I see photos in Cage Birds
of open aviaries and the most glowing accounts of their owners as to
the welfare and health of their birds--well, all I can say is I cannot
imagine how they work it against this climate in winter especially
and the pests of vermin. Now, you have my experience, and I hope this
experience will not prevent members from joining the Avicultural
Society.

After the trim and garden-like beauty of the Bermudas one gets
rather a shock of landing at Nassau in the Bahamas. It strikes one
as a place which the Colonial Office had forgotten about. Its collection
of ramshackle houses meander away from the docks until they are
finally lost in the " bush " which covers the main part of island. The
one redeeming feature is the amount of glorious flowering trees and
shrubs which help to hide the squalor of the houses.
As the Bahamas are a vast collection of islands stretching for more
than eight hundred miles from north to south, a short stay on New
Providence Island, on which the capital is situated, gives one no idea
of the bird-life of the whole group.
As every one knows, or least is taught at school, the Bahamas were
discovered by Columbus on his first memorable voyage to the West
and from his description of them we gather that they must have indeed
appeared, in their virgin beauty, as the isles of the blest. Covered
with magnificent vegetation they supported the wonderful bird-life
with which the islands were teeming. Not only did the Spaniards
exterminate in twenty or so years, the whole of the human inhabitants,
but they set rolling the ball of extermination which has not

stopped yet. The massacre of bird-life in the Bahamas was greatly
accentuated by the slaves after they were given their freedom, when
they slaughtered, and still do, every feathered creature for food, until
to-day the bird-life is but a mere remnant of its former numbers.
And the Parrots of which Columbus says flocks darkened the skies,
are now reduced to a few individuals living on one single island of the
many hundreds which make up this group ; a similar fate has happened
to the vast flocks of Flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber) which also lived
on the Bahamas.
I was told that the dearth of small birds on New Providence was
due firstly to hurricanes, and secondly to the natives who nearly all
possess catapults and kill almost every small bird. The first explana-
tion is hardly likely, for the hurricanes have always occurred in these
islands and yet the birds were there originally in their thousands.
Certainly small birds are conspicuous by their absence.
The following are a few of the birds observed during a very short
stay at Nassau.
The bird one sees as one nears the islands is a gull which superficially
looks like our familiar Black-headed Gull but on close acquaintanceship
with it one sees that it differs considerably in having the whole of the
back and wings a darkish grey. This is the American Laughing Gull
(Larus atricilla). It is first observed miles from the islands far out
at sea when it comes to follow in the wake of the steamers for scraps
thrown overboard. It flies around the docks and harbour on the look-
out for an odd scrap of fish or meat, but I never saw one perch on quays
or sea-walls for doubtless the birds have learned the kind of reception
they would get from the hands of the black population. This bird
is if anything a shade smaller than the Black-headed Gull and is much
more light and graceful in flight.
In and around Nassau one sees a great many Kingbirds or as we
know them in this country, Tyrants. Whether these are the real
Pitangus bahamensis, I do not know, for I was told that owing to
most of the indigenous species being exterminated many exotic species 1
have been introduced both from North and South America. The
Kingbirds in their habits resemble Flycatchers, always being seen on
the topmost branches of trees, on telegraph wires or any other point

of vantage where it may have a clear view to enable it to catch such
winged prey as flies, moths, beetles and in fact any manner of flying
insects. Every few minutes these birds sally forth into the air, returning
to the same perch, a loud snap of the bill being the only indication
that it has captured anything. The Kingbirds are the commonest
birds in Nassau and are seen in the main streets, squares, and in the
various gardens.
In the country the little Bahama Ground or Passerine Dove
(Chcemepelia passerine bahamensis) is very common and one sees it
trotting along, always in pairs, by the sides of the dusty roads, loath
to take flight and when it does so it flies with a rapid swaying flight
either into a low tree or into the dense " bush This bird is found
in many closely related forms throughout most of the Attillean Islands
where its habits always remain the same, though in many islands such
as Haiti it has been nearly exterminated by the natives. These tiny
Doves are seen to feed on minute seeds which they find on the bare
and arid ground.
Much rarer than the forgoing is the beautiful Key West Dove
(Geotrygon martinica), a bird much persecuted by the black population
owing to its food value. I saw this bird but once in the wild state in
the thick vegetation near a large lake in the centre of the island. It
was extremely wild and quickly dashed into the dense growth of
jungle. I saw two others in captivity both in perfect condition, I did
not attempt to purchase them as I expected to get many more birds
from other islands, but I rather wish now that I had done so, though
I am not greatly enamoured with the pigeon family, for their beauty
does not often compensate for their lethargy and excessive pugnacity ;
the Geotrygon Pigeons which are extremely attractive in captivity
and whose habits seems to resemble those of a gallinacious bird rather
than those of a Pigeon, being the exception.
The most characteristic and certainly the most beautiful bird I came
across in the Bahamas was the splendid Multi-coloured Tanager
(Spindalis zena), a bird comparatively common in the " bush " lands
on the island of New Providence. It is the first bird which strikes
the eye of even the most casual observer, with its unique striped
plumage. This is one of the birds which seems to be the connecting

link between tbe Grosbeaks and the true Tanagers. It has the same
build and looks very muck like one of tbe large North American
Grosbeaks. These birds are comparatively tame and allow one to
get quite close to admire their lovely plumage, in fact I spent the most
enjoyable part of my short stay on the island in watching these lovely
birds as they moved and turned their bodies about as if to display the
wonderful combinations of colour to the observer as they sit in the
small fir trees with which the island is mainly covered. The birds go
about either singly or in pairs but I seemed to see a preponderance of
males. The birds seem to feed mainly on the small yellow currant-like
berries of a certain shrub which is common on the wilder parts of the
island.
The Tanagers would make prime favourites as aviary birds and I
wonder that none have ever been imported. I did not bother to try
and obtain any in the Bahamas as I thought I might be able to secure
a closely allied bird from Haiti but in this I was disappointed. Birds
of this genus are found in most of the West Indian islands and they
differ but little from each other.
Another bird no doubt closely allied to the foregoing is the beautiful
so called Bahama Bullfinch (Loxigilla violacea), a much larger bird
than our native Bullfinch and much more striking in colour, being
of a deep velvety-black with the throat, forehead, and a line over the
eye and the under tail-coverts, a bright chestnut red. These birds
are the denizens of the thick scrub on New Providence and at once
attract the attention of the traveller by their striking plumage which
is very noticeable against the light green foliage of the jungle-like
vegetation. That these birds are quite common is evinced by the
fact that the birds' peculiar cricket-like note or song can be heard much
more frequently than it is seen. In fact so commonly is this sound
heard as one progresses through the " bush " that one begins to wonder
if it is not an insect after all which is making it. Like the Tanager,
the strikingly coloured cock bird is always much more in evidence
than his mate ; possibly because the latter was concerned with her
maternal duties. The female is much more sombrely clad than her
mate and can easily be overlooked. The birds feed mainly on the
seeds of berries which grow so abundantly all over the island and no

<bodyText confidence="0.998911138888889" page_id="56289509"  page_num="57" year="" vol="">
doubt also on insects. Some years ago I was familiar with a sub-
species of this bird on the island of Dominica where it was very common
and took the same place amongst the avifauna that the Sparrow does
in England. Speaking about Sparrows reminds me that the Bahamas
are one of the few places where the English Sparrow does not appear
to have established itself. It had certainly been introduced, but why it
should fail to find a foothold is rather a mystery, possibly the hurricanes
are too much for it.
The Bahama Bullfinch would make a delightful cage-bird and would
no doubt readily breed, but I don't know whether it has been imported;
I rather think the sub-species from Jamaica has been. G-osse speaks
of this bird ( Pyrrhulagra violacea ruficollis) and calls it the Cotton-
tree Sparrow in his Birds of Jamaica and says that he kept it in captivity
and also the Tanager which he calls the " Cashew Bird ".
In common with other parts of the world, most birds on the Bahamas
are found around the old plantations of the natives. Outside Nassau
there are few gardens or fields, as we know them, as there is very
little soil lying on the coral rock. The method of cultivation seems to
be to scrape the soil into holes on the rocky surface and there plant, if
the hole is large enough, perhaps a banana plant or a fruit tree, or if it
is too small for these, a maize plant is put in, hence the plantations
consist of an odd plant here and there growing amidst a tangle of weeds.
This type of land attracts numerous birds, the most conspicuous of which
is the variously named Ani, Savanah Cuckoo, Rain-bird ( Crotophaga
ani), etc. This strange relation of the cuckoo is found on most of the
West Indian Islands where it is always the first bird seen by the newcomer
to the islands. It is totally unlike any other bird I know of both in
appearance and habits. About 14 or 15 inches in length it is a glossy
iridescent black in colour and it has a peculiar boat-shaped tail which
never seems to be quite properly fastened to the body. It has a very
distinctive lazy flopping flight but it never seems to fly far, usually
off the ground into some nearby bush or tree. The bird is at home in
the meadows or savanahs where the cattle graze and is seen in small
flock or family parties of about six or seven. When disturbed the birds
take off one after another and fly in single file until they alight one
above the other on some sloping branch.

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
The Ani lives on large insects which it procures from the ground.
The upper mandible is greatly enlarged and flattened towards the
centre, resembling that of a miniature hornbill. The knife-shaped ridge
of the upper mandible enables the bird to dig in the soil or manure for
the larvae of certain large beetles. When the birds are disturbed they
utter a strange querulous cry resembling that of the Guira Cuckoo.
Few birds are more gregarious than this one and they always give
the impression that they delight in each other's company. I should
imagine the Ani would make a most delightful and intelligent pet but
it would appear that it has never been kept in this country.
A near relative of the Ani is the Mangrove Cuckoo ( Coccyzus minor),
a bird which it in no way resembles either in plumage or demeanour.
This bird does not appear especially to frequent the Mangrove thickets
of which there appear to be few in the Bahamas. It is found creeping
silently about in the dense vegetation which covers the coral rocks
on New Providence Island, in search of caterpillars, upon which it
largely subsists. It is a bird which never obtrudes itself upon the notice
of the observer and if it becomes aware that it is being watched it
quietly slips away into the undergrowth. In colour and shape it
rather resembles the better known American Yellow-billed Cuckoo,
but the beak appears to be longer and black in colour.
A very common but modest little bird is the Black-faced Grass
Finch or Quit ( Tiaris bicolor ), a near relation of the well-known Cuban
and Olive Finches. It is found in the gardens of Nassau, by the
roadsides, and in most of the native plantations or wherever there is a
chance of its finding the minute grass seeds upon which it lives. Being
so small and sombrely coloured it escapes attention in the low herbage,
but as one approaches their feeding grounds one or two birds will
rise up, perch on a nearby branch or wire rail and as soon as the supposed
danger passes, the birds drop back into the flock and continue their
feeding, but should the birds on the look out think the danger
threatening, they will give the alarm note, and the whole flock will
rise up and take shelter in a nearby bush.
Nearly all the West Indian Islands have their own species of honey
creepers, small and rather inconspicious birds reminding one somewhat
of sunbirds (Certhiola bahamissis). This bird is usually seen moving

with rapidity over the masses of flowering creepers and vines searching
for minute insects and sucking the honey from the blossoms. It is
very impatient of observation and soon makes off if it sees that it
is being watched. By the way it settles on the trunks of trees and runs
up the bark it reminds one of the European Creeper. This species is
about 4J inches in length and is greyish brown above with a white line
over the eye and white markings on the wings, the throat is dark
grey and the under parts pale yellow, the bill is long, slender, and curved.
When Columbus landed on the Bahamas he found the various
islands tenanted by countless thousands of the beautiful Ruddy
Elamigoes. Alas ! owing to ceaseless persecution on the part of the
black and white inhabitants these wonderful birds have been reduced
to the merest remnant of their former numbers. Three small colonies
appear to be left, one on each of the following islands, Andros, Abaco,
and Inagua. These are now fortunately protected by the government,
otherwise the birds would have doubtless been exterminated, as the
young ones are greatly esteemed by the natives for food.
Before the discovery of these islands another bird was exceed-
ingly abundant; this was the beautiful Bahama Islands Amazon
Parrot (Amazona bahamensis). Judging by the statement of Columbus
that " flocks of Parrots do obscure the sun " these birds must have
been exceedingly numerous. These vast flocks have now disappeared
for ever and a pitiful remnant remain on one small island, a testimony
to the destructiveness of the white races, though I suppose the black
inhabitants, mainly escaped slaves from America, were responsible
for the slaughter of vast numbers of these birds for food.
This bird is the most northerly of the " Island " Amazons and
is at the same time one of the most beautiful. I made every inquiry
in Nassau concerning this bird but no one seemed to know anything
about its present status.
Every one had heard of them, but all said that they were very
rare nowadays. A friend has recently taken up his abode on Exuma
Island, which is not a great distance from the island where the bird
is still found. He has promised to send me information concerning it,
and also try to obtain a specimen for me.

The O.P.S. was formed last June and already we have reached
a membership of 132, and as members are still coming in very steadily
we shall soon reach the 200 mark. At the inauguration meeting, which
was held at the house of Mr. G. Blay, who by the way is our President,
a temporary committee was formed to function until a sufficient
number of members merited the election of a permanent committee.
This has now been done, although at the time of writing I am unable
to give the names of the new Committee, but I can say that there is
every prospect of a committee that I shall be proud to work with as
their secretary. The importance of a good committee can hardly be
over-estimated in our case for during this year we have many problems
facing us, all of which will require careful thought and active
co-operation. In the first place we have to consider the publication of
a booklet which we hope will not only be interesting but enlightening.
We intend asking well known and experienced fanciers throughout the
world to contribute short and pithy articles and, moreover, every
member will be invited to write his own experiences in rearing and
keeping Pheasants. Again, we intend to set up an exchange board,
as we consider that such a board will do much to stop the in-breeding
of Pheasants, for it will be readily admitted that this breach of all the
laws of nature is flagrant in this country. When the board is working
if any member wishes to exchange a Pheasant of either sex or any
species it will only be necessary to write me and if such a Pheasant is
on our exchange list the exchange will be effected at merely a nominal
cost ; surely such a board will be a splendid achievement.
In the not far distant future we shall hope to import rare Pheasants,
not for the benefit of any particular member, but for the general good
of all members who wish to participate. Thus early in the autumn we
shall hope to find out from members their requirements and send our
order accordingly. All the necessary work attached to the importation
of Pheasants will be undertaken by the O.P.S. It may appear that we
are attempting a lot, but we consider that if we are not ambitious we
shall never make any headway. We are quite determined to make the
Society a flourishing one, and to accomplish this our schemes may

But this cannot be laid at our door, for our ambition is made of nobler

There are still many Pheasant fanciers who belong to the Avicultural
Society but not to the O.P.S. Once more may I urge such fanciers to
join us. Every member helps, it is not so much the financial aspect that
concerns us, although we will admit that money is important, but it is
the moral effect of a large and ever-growing membership that must tell
the tale. The subscription is a paltry 5s.

THE CHERRY FINCH--A CORRECTION
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.987488391304348" page_id="56289514"  page_num="62" year="" vol="">
We were interested, though somewhat surprised, at a statement that
appeared in the note accompanying the Caley plate on Cherry Finches in the
December issue of the Magazine, to the effect that these birds are " one of the
hardiest and most easily managed of the Australian Finches 55 .
Judging by our own considerable experience of them and that of other
aviculturists with whom we have discussed them, Cherry Finches would
seem to merit exactly the opposite of this sanguine description, and one is
tempted, therefore, to assume that this statement must have been culled
from some old book, usually a most unreliable source of information.
We have had at various times numerous pairs of Cherry Finches here at
Keston, some of which have reared fine broods of young ones with us.
Unfortunately, however, a bird that is willing to breed may be just as willing
to die--in this case suddenly and without the slightest cause--and this,
coupled with their inability to winter out of doors without heat, has been our
invariable experience with this beautiful Finch.
Edward J. Boosey.
I regret intensely that I have published an inaccurate statement con-
cerning the hardiness of the Cherry Finch, and am greatly obliged to
Mr. Boosey for his letter. I have never kept Cherry Finches, so had recourse
to Butler's Foreign Finches in Captivity and Foreign Birds in Cage and
Aviary, works which I believed to be reliable, which describe this Finch
as " perfectly hardy, capable of standing severe winters in an unheated
aviary." -- Ed.

generally 4 4 that Pheasants are most friendly creatures and live happily with
small birds and in no way interfere with the other occupants of the aviary
No doubt Mr. Lambert has very good grounds for saying this, but, though
cases of the contrary may be so rare as to be hardly more than proof of his
rule, they are apt to be so painful that their existence should not be forgotten.
In your own experience and mine a cock Peacock Pheasant shared for
months blamelessly an aviary that included a cock Elliott's Pitta that was,
I believe, the first of his wonderful race that ever came to this country and
extraordinarily beautiful, even for a Pitta. At all events, he was a very great
treasure, and time has hardly dulled the pang with which I heard that the
Pheasant had murdered him.
I think that to any advice that weaker birds can be kept safely with
Pheasants should be added the rider that there is risk enough to make it unwise
to let the fellow-lodger be any great treasure and especially any bird that lives
likewise chiefly on the ground.

THE TAHITI BLUE LORY
(\0x25A0Coriphilus peruvianus)

Polynesia is the home of several very beautiful Lories which are
particularly attractive, not only by their small size and lovely colours,
but also by their graceful and playful ways. They are really the gems
of the Parrot family. Fiji, Samoa, Washington, and Fanning Islands,
and a few others, possess several delightful species, whose plumage
shows varied hues of scarlet, dark blue, and green, but the Society
Paumoter, and Marquesas groups can boast of the lovely blue Lories
of the genus Coriphilus .
Unfortunately, these birds have now become very scarce. In the
last century they disappeared from the more settled islands, probably
being victims of rats and other pests introduced by man. Very little
is known of their habits, but it seems that they feed mostly on the
flowers of the coco-nut palm, which still are as numerous as ever,
so that it does not appear that their disappearance was due to destruc-
tion of their natural habitat.
It was thought--even a few years ago--that both species of
Coriphilus were extinct, and it is gratifying to find that is not so,
as several pairs have been brought over to America and to England
lately. It is somewhat surprising, as they are supposed to be strictly

protected throughout the French South Sea Possessions. But it
seems almost impossible to enforce regulations on such remote and
scattered islands.
Let us hope that the Blue Lories will do well in captivity. The
pair which has been deposited at the London Zoo for over a year
seems to be in perfect condition and to live happily in a cage in the
Parrot house, on the ordinary fruit and honey mixture used for all
brushed-tongued Parrots. If they could be bred and propagated
in aviaries, one of the most interesting of the genera of birds threatened
with extinction could be saved.
The Tahiti Lory is very dark blue, with snowy white face, ear-
coverts, throat, and upper breast. The Ultramarine Lory ( C . ultra-
marinus), from the Marquesas Islands, is prettier still: light sea blue
above, with a dark blue cap and breast-band, the rest of the under-
parts mottled white and blue ; bill black. Some pairs of the latter
species have also just been imported, and it is said to be even scarcer
in its native country than the Tahiti Lory.

We had lain at anchor over night in the beautiful Kingston Harbour.
A serene tropical dawn stole softly over the sky revealing a picture of
dreamlike fantasy ; the great Blue Mountains in the background j
towering into the, as yet, pale blue sky. The lowlands at the base
were veiled with a white heat mist, an indication of the heat that would
follow. The sea was calm and blue as it only can be on a morning in
the tropics. It was still and calm, so still that never a leaf of the palm
trees shivered, not a breath of wind ruffled the glass-like surface of the
ocean. The only sound that broke the stillness of that early morning
as the light got brighter on that perfect June day was the chorus
of feathered songsters that floated over the waters from the palm-fringed
shores over half a mile away. For half an hour the peace was like that

of a dream but soon the deck hands were astir and the tranquil atmo-
sphere was shattered by the roar of winches and the coarse shouting
of the cargo hands.
Jamaica, before the advent of the white races there, must have been
a land of surpassing beauty. The whole surface from the seashore
to the top of the highest mountain was covered with magnificent
forest, the trees being of gigantic proportions. Though most of these
giant trees have been felled, Jamaica is fortunate indeed in having vast
tracts of virgin forest left, mostly in the central mountainous districts.
Here the mountains rise almost perpendicularly to a great height
and as this area is unfit for most of the recognized crops, it is
left untouched except where the natives clear patches on the
incredibly steep mountain sides for the production of a few bananas,
yams or mangos. The island possessed formerly a very wonderful
and distinctive bird-life, but in keeping with the other West Indian
Islands scant care or thought was given to the feathered life. Some
species are now extinct, others are exceedingly rare and only about a
dozen can be called really common. There are two reasons for the
diminution of the bird-life, firstly the trapping and shooting by the
natives of vast quantities of birds for food and secondly by the imported
mongoose which has all but exterminated most of the ground birds.
The following are a few of the birds seen on an all too short a stay on
this beautiful island.
The Southern Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura). One would think
on approaching Kingston that there was some great aerial display
over the city, until on closer acquaintance with these seeming aeroplanes,
one realizes that they are no man-made contrivances, but vultures.
There seem to be thousands of them wheeling round and round on
outstretched motionless wings ; no single one in the whole concourse
ever appears to flap his pinions, as round and round they go from early
morning until evening.
The " John Crow 55 as he is known in Jamaica is perhaps the
commonest of all birds on that island. He is seen everywhere, always
with his ever watchful eye on the main chance ; in native backyards,
by the roadsides, on the wharves, walking through culverts, on
rubbish heaps, in fact he is everywhere. I once saw a native woman

washing and gutting a few small fish on the seashore with four or
five vultures standing so close that I thought the birds would snatch
the tempting morsels out of her hands at any moment. As soon as
she was gone there was an immediate scramble for the bits of offal.
There must be a serious food shortage amongst these birds for I
am sure that the available amount of carrion and garbage cannot
possibly be adequate for the enormous number of vultures which
inhabit the island. In Jamaica an enormous amount of green coco-nuts
are used for their milk alone, the flesh and husk being thrown away
and I have often seen the birds picking out the flesh from the discarded
nuts by the roadsides. There has always been a great controversy
about the sense of smell in birds, but the natives of Jamaica aver that
this bird has a keen sense of smell and that it discovers most of its
food in that way. Whilst I was on the island there was a sensational
murder trial and the bodies of the two murdered people were stated to
have been found by the fact that that vultures were circling low over
the house. I was told that the birds will descend into pits or wells if
there is a dead animal lying at the bottom, though I cannot vouch
for the truth of this statement. The birds never seemed to look in
good condition, their plumage appearing worn and bedraggled. Some
birds had their flight feathers so battered that they had a difficulty
in taking off from the ground. I was told that a large colony of these
birds nested in a park in the centre of Kingston, but the place got so
unbearably offensive that the vultures were finally cleared out.
The Mountain Witch Ground Pigeon (Geotrygon versicolor).
Jamaica boasts of nine species of Pigeons, all of them very distinct
and of great beauty. Formerly they existed in vast numbers but
trapping, shooting, and the mongoose have greatly reduced their ranks
until none but the little Ground Dove can be called common, four
species are rare, and one, the subject of this chapter, practically extinct.
In this bird I was greatly interested and by an unusual stroke of good
luck I was able to secure several pairs. These birds had been kept
in captivity for several years and had been sent to America where,
owing to trouble with the Customs Authorities, it had been refused
admission into that country and had been sent back to Jamaica. Of
this bird, Gosse says in his Birds of Jamaica, " No description can

give an adequate notion of the lustrous radiance of this most lovely
bird." It is certainly one of the most beautiful of all known Pigeons
and after the wonderful Long-tailed Humming Bird, can truly be called
the loveliest of Jamaican birds. Even a hundred years ago it was
spoken of as rare and to-day in the mountainous districts the natives
if spoken to about it will say, " All gone, never come no more," and
most of the residents of Jamaica who are interested in birds admit
that it is the rarest of all the birds on the island.
Never common, the native shooters and the imported mongoose
have reduced it to a dying remnant. I only hope that the birds I
brought back will prove easy breeders and the race, in captivity at
least, will be perpetuated. Several of the birds I purchased were
avairy bred from the first original pairs which my friend in Jamaica
procured. According to various people with whom I spoke this
bird inhabits the most obscure and densely wooded mountains, where
it lives mainly on the ground searching for fallen berries and seeds
which form its food. The bird nests on the ground, usually at the base
of some forest tree. This, of course, had fatal results where the mongoose
had penetrated the districts where the birds were found.
I was told that it was necessary to provide the birds when in captivity
with a box on the ground with fairly high sides when nesting, for on
the slightest disturbance the&apos; young will rush out of the nest and hide
in the vegetation or obscure corners. This confirms the statement of
Gosse that " the Mountain Witch lays in March in the angle of the roots
of a tree on the ground ; that the young leave the nest about a week
after they are hatched and are led about by the mother who scratches
for them in the manner of a fowl."
Several people mentioned to me the scratching habit of this
bird. It is strange to think of a pigeon, scratching in the ground but
no stranger than the Cyanoramphus Parrakeets which have the same
habit. In captivity the birds have a very strange habit of squatting
down on the ground with the breast touching the earth and the tail
pointing upwards at a greater height than the head ; the full chestnut
marked under tail-coverts are relaxed and turned towards the observer
so that all one sees of the birds is the spread out under tail-coverts.
This is without a doubt a protective action when the bird is resting on

the ground, for it would then be well nigh invisible on the floor of
the forest ; the under tail-coverts exactly resembling a small cluster
of dead leaves. The birds will remain in this position for a long time
quite motionless.
Gosse says " Its coo consists of two loud notes, the first short and
sharp, the second protracted and descending in a mournful cadence.
At a distance its first note is inaudible, and the second reiterated at
measured intervals sounds like the groans of a dying man. These
moans heard in the most recluse and solemn glens while the bird is
rarely seen have probably given it the name of " Mountain Witch
This Pigeon differs in its general demeanour from any other Pigeons
with which I am acquainted and in many of its habits seems rather to
resemble a gallinaceous bird than a member of the Columbidse. Its
gait resembles that of a water hen. The bird walks quickly lifting
the feet high at each step during which time the tail is jerked up and
down. In fact the bird can run with great rapidity, and in a wild state,
trusts more on its fleetness of foot to escape its enemies than on its
power of flight. In its habit of scratching the ground and of the young
following the mother about shortly after they are hatched, this bird
resembles the Gallinaceous birds. The eggs too, instead of being white
as in most Pigeons, are said to be a buff colour. As these birds were
very expensive I advertised a pair for sale, but had so many requests
for them that I rather foolishly sold all but one pair : these I hope will
breed next season as I have just the type of aviary for them, but
unfortunately at the moment rats have got in, so until these are cleared
out I cannot release them in it. I do not think there is the slightest
chance that any more of these birds will be brought to this country,
which is a pity, as they are certainly the most attractive of all
pigeons in captivity.
The Bald Pate or White-headed Pigeon (Columha leucocephala ).
Of the nine species of Pigeons found in Jamaica five are indigenous
to the island, but this species is not one of them, being found in many
of the West Indian Islands where it is esteemed as an article of food.
The " Bald Pate " is perhaps the most striking of the islands' Pigeons
after the rare and lovely " Mountain Witch In flight the bird

strikingly coloured bird, the whole of the head from the gape through
the eye to the back of the head is snow white, the rest of the body
slate-grey, on the neck are four diagonal stripes of iridescent steel green
feathers which are edged with black. The female has the head more
of a soiled white colour. Like all the other pigeons of Jamaica this
bird is exceedingly wild and wary. This is due to the fact that it is
greatly persecuted by both the black and the white population who shoot
it extensively in the shooting season. It is also trapped and shot
surreptitiously by the natives all the year round. Although a true
Pigeon this bird resembles the Fruit Pigeons in the manner of feeding.
It feeds on all manner of berries and fruits of the forest trees and rarely
if ever descends to the ground. In captivity it is very awkward on the
ground and walks with great discomfort, owing to the very short legs.
The bird has a beautiful carriage and is what one might call " stream-
lined
This bird, while not being nearly as attractive as its congener the
" Mountain Witch " is lively and intelligent and lacks the usual
lethargic demeanour of most of the pigeons. I secured two pairs of
these beautiful pigeons which I brought home with me.
The Pea Dove (Zenaida zenaida). This small but handsome species
is much more robust in. shape than the foregoing. It is about the same
size as a Turtle Dove but much plumper. It is fairly common in the
lightly wooded and cleared district, but like the other Jamaican Doves
it is shy and wary. It is a ground bird, but is seldom seen except in
flight as it usually spots the observer long before one has observed the
bird and all one sees is but a fleeting glimpse as the bird flies swiftly
to safety.
The Dove is a rich cinnamon brown, spotted and marked with black
and with a very beautiful iridescent violet patch on the side of the
neck. I was offered examples of this bird but having so many of the
rarer pigeons and none too many cages I did not purchase any.
The White-winged Dove (Melojpelia asiatica). A true Turtle Dove,
this is a very handsome species, the most striking feature being the
brilliant blue patch of skin around the eye which makes an unusual
contrast to the pale brownish-grey of the rest of the body. It is a fairly
common bird and one which is frequently snared by the natives.

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
In my search for rare birds I would often hear of someone who
had a collection, but I usually found on arriving at the abode of the
person who kept them, that the collection consisted of Doves, usually
" white-wings I was rather surprised to see this apparent interest
in birds by the black races, but I was afterwards disgusted to find that
these birds were only kept as a titbit to add to the " pot " on occasion.
The only other birds the natives keep, from other than a culinary point
of view, are the Yellow-billed Parrots which they hope one day
to sell.
The White-bellied Jamaican Ground Dove (Leptotila jamaicensis ).
This very beautiful species is confined to Jamaica where it is far from
common. These birds live in the remote woods and forests on the
mountains, so are very seldom seen by the casual observer.
I obtained a true pair of these lovely birds, but alas ! tragedy
dogged their footsteps from the first. I put them in a large cage with
the other Doves which I had purchased in Kingston, but on the first
day out, while fixing a perch in the cage, the male slipped out over my
hand. It flew around the ship for a time and eluded all or efforts to
capture it. At length when passing a light buoy, the bird flew towards
it, but had not the strength to reach it so sank into the sea and was
drowned.
This Dove is terrestrial and I am afraid has suffered badly owing
to the Mongoose. It is very light in colour, being pure white below,
and pale fawn above, the sides of the neck being suffused with a beautiful
amethyst pink. It is very rotund in shape. I still have the female
and hope next year to obtain more of this species.
The Ruddy Quail Dove (Oreopeleia montana). This extraordinary
looking little bird is not common in Jamaica, in fact, I believe it is
now rare in all its former widespread habitats especially in Cuba,
where it is nearly extinct. At one time, owing to the depredation of
the Mongoose, it was said to have become very rare in Jamaica, but
now it is said to have increased somewhat in numbers owing to its
now nesting higher up out of reach of that bloodthirsty little pest.
It haunts the deepest recesses of the forests and is seldom seen. I saw
several specimens in captivity in Jamaica and all were badly plucked,
for I was told that it was very pugnacious. I secured only one pair of

these birds which I brought home, and found that they were extremely
attractive, being the tamest Doves I have ever possessed, letting me
pick them up and hold them without making the slightest resistance.
I am rather sorry now that I did not purchase more pairs. There is
something very un-Pigeon-like about these birds and I have never
been able to find out quite what it is.
In colour the male is a bright chestnut with a beautiful purple
sheen, the throat and wings marked with cream. The female is
altogether different and might be taken for another species, being of
a pale brownish olive marked with brown.
The Jamaican Ground Dove ( Chaemepelia passerina jamaicensis).
In Bermuda the little Ground Dove is exceedingly numerous and a
familiar sight by the road sides, but the species confined to Jamaica is
exceedingly wild and wary, and on the first sight of a human being
dash with all speed to safety. This is due to the incessant killing
by native boys with catapults. Attempts have been made to prohibit
natives from owning these catapults, but these have been in vain.
This is one of the tiniest of known Doves, being about the size of
a sparrow, hence its Latin name. To my mind it is one of the most
beautiful and attractive of the Doves and should make a prime favourite
as an aviary bird if it were imported. It is smaller and far more
attractive than the well-known Diamond Dove of Australia, which
is so commonly imported into this country. Gosses gives the weight
of the bird as 1 oz. 16 gr., so one can imagine it is a very tiny creature
indeed.
In colour the male is various shades of grey, the feathers of the
neck and breast laced with darker and lighter shades, the whole being
suffused with a lovely shade of pink, the flights are chestnut, the
wing coverts marked with spots of dark blue.
These little birds frequent the open grass lands and meadows, usually
in pairs or small family parties. They are to be seen trotting along
with nodding heads, stopping every now and then to pick up some
minute seeds. I secured two pairs of these attractive birds, which I
brought home with me.
The Active Amazon (. Amazon agilis). Often in my search for rare
birds in my travels I have been singularly lucky and the present case

was no exception. One of my chief reasons for visiting Jamaica was
to find out something more regarding the status of this exceedingly
rare Parrot. In a previous article in the Magazine written after
a short stay in Jamaica in 1929, I stated that I thought the birds
were extinct. I now find that this generalization was formed after
a too hasty conclusion by having made inquiries in parts where the
bird, though formerly found, has now disappeared. This time I was
more fortunate in being able to visit districts ordinarily inaccessible
to the casual traveller visiting Jamaica. By boarding an " intermediate
liner ", which is the polite and official designation of a tramp steamer,
I was able to circle the whole island, often stopping at small and obscure
ports in our search for cargoes of rum, spices, dye-woods, etc., etc.
One such place was Falmouth, a tiny tropical town and a place more
unlike its English namesake it would be impossible to imagine, a
reminder of the far off and prosperous days of slavery, with many
decaying mansions and planters' houses--a mute reminder of the distant
days of affluence. Except for the shipping now and then of casks
of rum and bags of sugar and annotto, nothing disturbs the atmosphere
of laissez-faire which pervades the place. From this tiny seaport
I made a journey of 25 miles or so into an incredibly lovely district
in the mountains. I had an introduction to a lady who was staying
there, a keen entomologist, and meeting there another lady I was in
turn introduced to a third lady, the mistress of a girls' high school
situated in the most beautiful and romantic spot possible to imagine ;
the virgin forest came down to the very edge of the school grounds,
and from the balconies of the house it was possible to see the far distant
mountains of Cuba. From this lady I learned quite a lot about the
Parrots, that this species, A. agilis, still exists in very small numbers
in a certain nearby and very mountainous district. It is very much
rarer than its congener, the Collared Amazon, and in fact is possibly the
rarest of all the known Amazons, including even the very rare Imperials
and Guildings. In common with A . collaria, it raids the corn plantations
of the natives where it does considerable damage to the growing crops.
This bird seems to move about in certain restricted parts of the island
at different times of the year. During the time I was in Jamaica it
was breeding far away in the deepest recess of the mountain forests.

I left no stone unturned in my search either to secure or to see a wild
specimen of this bird. In the former I was lucky, but not in regard to
the latter, though had I more time I dare say I could have penetrated
the forests with a guide and seen the birds. There was a fine pair of
the birds in an aviary at the Jamaica Institute in Kingston. They
were in company with the two other species from Jamaican territory,
A. collaria and A. caymanensis . These were the first I had ever seen
of this very rare species. A. agilis is slightly larger and more robust
in form than its cogener, A. collaria . It is of a green colour seldom seen
in the Amazon, a rich dark shining laurel green.
I spent a small fortune in car fares, chasing round and tracking
down all the Amazons I heard of, but failed to find a single specimen of
this species in captivity until I met with a dusky person, an extraordinary
individual who had his little garden in Kingston full of very original
types of aviaries, full of Jamaican birds, and all, except some of the
Doves which fought each other, in perfect condition From him
I obtained a wonderful specimen of the Collared Amazon, in fact the
finest specimen of any Amazon I have ever seen ; but alas ! there was
no agilis. Our coloured friend said that he would do his best. He did,
and early one Sunday morning some days later, as I was concluding
my other purchases, one of these birds turned up with its owner.
I really don't know which was the most decrepit, the bird or its owner !
Had I not known the species I would never have guessed it. It had
a pitiful despairing cry, and I really had to purchase it even though the
price was high, just to say that I had actually owned one of these
birds, for I thought that it might be the last of its species !
Once aboard the ship it appeared too weak even to eat. For two
days it refused to feed, but at last nibbled a bit of banana. Finally,
I had to resort to the syringe method of feeding, using the same kind
of food that I was feeding the young collaria on, which was mashed up
paw-paw, banana, and biscuit. The bird was too weak even to bite,
and it only protested with a feeble whimper. In a short time it seemed
to enjoy the food and there was no trouble about forcing the mixture
down its throat.
In the southern part of the Island this bird appears to have dis-
appeared altogether, and it was in that part that my previous inquiries

were made. This Parrot is now only found in certain restricted
mountain forests in the districts of Trelawny and St. Ann, which are
situated in the central part of the northern slopes of the Island. These
areas are very sparsely populated and are covered with thick forest.
But even here the bird is rare. In my search for these birds I was told
on every hand by the natives that the " Black-bills " never lived very
long in captivity. I was always told in answer to my question, " Black-
bills, no good sah, he always die, soon, plenty soon." Why these birds
should die when its congener flourishes is rather a mystery. Also,
why it should have died out while the other bird continues to be still
fairly numerous, because the bird under discussion was far more
numerous than the Yellow-bill a matter of a hundred years ago when
Gosse wrote his book on the birds of Jamaica. In fact, one would have
thought that it would have been the Yellow-bill which would have been
the more scarce, for this bird is in far greater demand as a cage bird
and in the past large numbers were taken and hand-reared to sell in
Kingston.
It has been stated by scientists that the Island Amazons belong to
two groups. The first contains the four great island species
A. imperialis, A. guildingi, A. versicolor, and A. bouqueti, while all
the others, seven in number, from Cuba, Haiti, The Bahamas, Jamaica,
The Caymen Islands, and Porto Bico, are all sub-species of the wdiite-
fronted bird from Cuba. This is true in regard to six of the species,
but A . agilis is entirely distinct and is not closely related to any of the
others. It is one of the few Amazons which have a very distinct
sexual difference, as I will explain later on. It is also evident that this
bird has not the robust constitution of the others and that it cannot
stand the altered conditions which are brought about by the advance
of European civilization.
By a great stroke of luck, I was able to secure, shortly before I left
Jamaica, a perfect and true pair of these birds. I had given to me in
Kingston the address of a native, who some years ago offered a pair
of Black-bills for sale to the Jamaica Institute. He lived at a remote
place near Falmouth on the north coast. By a lucky chance I found
that he was one of the labourers who came to help load the casks of
rum on the ship. He said he hadn't any Black-bills as they were now

very rare but promised to go that evening into the forests in the
interior and try and find out any one who had one of these birds for
sale. Knowing the ways of natives I certainly didn't expect anything
to happen, especially as he had been working hard all day and would
certainly not feel like walking a great distance into the interior forests.
However, the next morning he appeared with a true pair of nestling
birds. They were wrapped up in a parcel of wire netting ! How they
managed to survive from being squashed to death I do not know.
However, they were in perfect condition and absolutely tame. The
native said that he had been into the forests, a distance of 17 miles
and obtained the birds from another native who had had them for
a fortnight. I should judge that they were from six to eight weeks old.
In both birds the plumage was a bright glossy green but not so
bright or rich as in the adult; the male had the ear-coverts washed
with brown, but the chief difference was the fact that the male had
the first four feathers in the primary coverts bright scarlet, whereas
in the female they were green. The male also had but one scarlet
feather on the forehead, while the female had many small scarlet and
yellow feathers intermixed with the green ones of the forehead. The
male also had the ends of the primary flight feathers, which are bright
blue, washed with pale pink and yellow. The bill of the cock was the
same colour as the adult, that is, a dark horn colour, but in the female
the bill was a yellowish colour, very much like that of the Yellow-bill.
The birds were a delightful couple, playing with one's fingers and
also with one another. I put them in a cage with five of my baby
Yellow-bills and they soon made friends and started to preen each
others feathers. They took kindly to the syringe method of feeding
but the hen would go into paroxysms of rage if any of the other birds
were fed before she was. The bottom of the cage was covered with
sheets of newspaper cut to fit, which could be changed several times
a day. On the sight of the syringe the hen would wait to see if she
was going to be the first fed, if not, she would instantly go to the floor of
the cage and amidst cries of rage, proceed to tear the paper into shreds !
After about a week or so, both birds started to nibble at the heads
of sweet corn which I had fixed on to the front of the cage, after that
they started to eat the corn, and then canary seed and various fruits.

The little hen never appear to be very robust or as strong as her brother,
her legs appeared to be slightly weak at the " knees " ! But they both
stood the journey all right and arrived in England in fairly good
condition. On arrival here they were put into a warmed birdroom
and put out every day with all the other Amazons I brought back,
fifteen in number, in a large outdoor aviary containing many growing
trees. Here they thoroughly enjoyed themselves and judging by the
noise they made I wonder we didn't get complaints from the neighbours !
At all events, they did so much damage to the growing trees that I had
to clear another smaller aviary which contained no vegetation, but
in which I fixed up decayed logs and twiggy branches on which they
could vent their destructive desires. In this aviary they were put
every day wet or fine. In fact the rain did them all a great deal of
good, and most of them dearly loved a rain bath, especially the Salle's
Amazons. The birds would hang upside down from the top of the
aviary, open their wings, and relax all their feathers and get thoroughly
drenched, screaming all the while at the top of their voices. After
three months the Actives moulted their body feathers but not the tail
or flights, and soon appeared almost like the adult bird. The hen's
tail feathers had never been very good, they appeared rather soft and
brittle, during the time she was moulting, new tail feathers grew on
the base of the old ones and these did not drop off until the new feathers
were fully grown.
Now, after five months both biids appear to be in perfect condition,
but both have entirely different dispositions. The cock is a good-
natured and lovable bird, while the hen is quick-tempered, peevish,
and always ready to give a nasty nip. In fact, both seem to exhibit
typically masculine and feminine traits.
There is every chance that given strict protection the small band of
survivors will manage to exist for many years to come, but should one
of the marauding parties of so-called scientific explorers set up their
camp in Jamaica as they have done in many other islands within
recent years, then I am afraid that the fate of this species will be quickly
sealed, and all there will be left to tell the tale will be a few fusty skins
in cabinets, and the world will be poorer by the loss of one more interesting
species swept into oblivion by so-called civilized Man.

The other trouble is that given the protection which the birds
now enjoy, the district in which they are found being so remote that
it is very difficult to enforce the law, and the bird being given to raiding
the native's ripening corn, is given no quarter, and whether the bird is
protected or otherwise is of no matter to the native.
So little known is this bird in captivity on the island, that I was
told by most people that it was practically extinct and it was quite
hopeless trying to obtain it. Unless any one goes to the trouble that
I did in going into the districts where it is now found, to procure
specimens, I doubt whether any more of these interesting birds will
ever be brought to this country. A great many scientific names are very
foolish, and this bird's is no exception, for it seems to be no more active
or agile than any other parrot, while the common nomenclature of
" All-green Amazon " is equally foolish, for the bird is scarlet and
blue besides green. " Jamaican Amazon " is also confusing for it
might apply to both birds.
The Collared Amazon (Amazona collaria). This small " Amazon "
Parrot, though not rare in the wild state, has always been scarce in this
country, probably because it is not brightly coloured, or a good talker,
and most people visiting Jamaica have purchased the larger South
American " Amazons " which were usually on sale in Kingston.
This bird is not by any means common, and those who wish to see it
in a state of freedom must travel right out into the virgin forest lands
on the high mountains where small flocks can sometimes be seen. This
Parrot is not kept nearly as often by the natives as formerly. This
is no doubt due to the Parrot ban in both America and England, for
most of the natives kept the birds in the hope that they would be
purchased by travellers and tourists. In Kingston there are now very
few of these birds in captivity. I only came across five ; three of these
I purchased, the other two being in the grounds of the Jamaica Institute.
The first thing I did in landing at Kingston was to tract down
the old " parrot woman " who had a shack near the docks and from
whom I had purchased Parrots on a previous visit to Jamaica. Though
I found her, her stock in trade had vanished, and in spite of my many
questions all I got from her was " Parrots no more sah, parrots no
more sah

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
On the advice of the curator of the Jamaica Institute I went to
see a certain coloured market gardener who might have birds for sale.
There amidst a collection of ramshackle rabbit hutches, etc., I found
a couple of young birds in a small and most utterly inconvenient
aviary. The brutal way in which the owner attempted to catch the
wretched birds with the aid of hammers, pincers, trowels, etc., so
terrified them that I finally tried my hand at the business and eventually
triumphed, though my clean white suit, shirt, collar and tie were so
bespatted with blood (both mine and the Parrots), that I looked as
though I had been in slaughter house! The birds after this treatment
were simply terrified for weeks at the sight of a human being. Another
bird was purchased in Kingston from the black parson and a real beauty
it was, rather reminding one of a Queen Alexandra Parrakeet in the
combination of soft pastel shades of pinks, blues, and greens. Its
condition was rather remarkable as it was fed entirely on dry bread
and rotten fruit, and kept in a very inadequate Parrot cage with an
iron perch, but I suppose its condition was due to the fact that it was
put under the tap every day to wash out the cage, the bird getting
a good deal of water on its plumage. The more I see of tropical birds
the more I am convinced that a good deal of moisture is necessary
on their plumage to keep it in good order, especially Parrots. I was given
strict instructions that if I wanted to make it talk I was to give it green
peppers to eat. It is a strange thing that all the natives of the West
Indies believe this. I wonder if there is any truth iu it ? It may be
of course that the peppers keep the birds in better condition, and having
more interest in things in general, soon pick up words. However the
birds greatly relished these peppers, which I used to buy from the native
markets. They are so terribly hot that the smallest nibble will so
burn one's mouth and blister one's tongue that one loses all sense of
taste for days afterwards and the seeds are like pieces of red hot metal
in the mouth ! and yet the birds eat them with impunity. The bird
purchased from the old black parson at " Ever Trust in God Cottage " !
was in better condition than any other Amazon I have seen, it had a
wonderful bloom on its plumage.
One Sunday a friend and I went into the heart of the forest country
near Moneague, where this bird is found, our main quest being the

rare " Black-bills We asked about every native seen en route if
he or she knew of any Parrots for sale. Usually we were not even given
an answer, merely a shake of the head. Sometimes someone thought
he knew of one but as often as not it turned out to be a rabbit ! As
we got into the wild and very beautiful country our quest seemed more
hopeful. One native had a pair of the birds which he had just taken from
the nest. He brought them from his hut and they proved to be birds of
about six to eight weeks old, almost fully fledged but quite unable to
feed themselves. They resembled the adult exactly in plumage. Going
further on, we came across a native boy who said that he could get us
a couple of " Black-bills ". This sounded too good to be true. He said
he knew of a nest of young birds but it would take him a couple of
hours to reach it and get back again. So we promised to call on the way
back. We continued on our journey but failed to find any more Parrots.
In a couple of hours we returned to the pre-arranged spot for our
prize. Our dusky friend was not there though some of his friends
were. They told us that he would soon be back, but the minutes turned
into hours and at last we were on the point of leaving, as my ship was
due to sail in the early evening and it was then late afternoon, and had
I have missed it, it would have meant a long journey by car to another
port to have caught it again. At last there was a commotion in the forest
and the boy appeared bringing in his basket, not the precious " Black-
bills " he had promised, but three tiny " Yellow-bills ", only a few
weeks old and with hardly a feather showing. Needless to say our
disappointment was great. In reply to our expostulations we were told
that the " Black-bills " were too young, so he brought " Yellow-bills "
instead ! Knowing what would happen to the birds if I left them,
I purchased them in the faint hope that I might be able to rear them.
They were excessively fat and felt more like downy bags of liquid
than any thing else. The natives said that so fat do the birds become
before fledging that the parents starve them so that they are able to fly
when they leave the nest. I can quite believe the truth of this statement.
We brought the birds back to the ship, arriving only a few minutes
before she sailed. I had brought cages, etc., for birds I might pick up
on the voyage, but I had no convenience for rearing young birds, and
Parrots are by no means the easiest of birds to hand-rear.

First of all I tried a mixture of crushed biscuit, banana and paw-paw.
The only available thing for feeding the birds was a fountain pen
filler but this was utterly inadequate. We then tried a small spoon
but the birds refused to accept this ; at last I tried to feed them by
giving them the food out of my mouth, but this too was a failure. I was
not terribly worried for the birds were excessively fat and could at the
worst, fast for a day or so until some suitable means were found.
They were covered with a damp towel so that none of the food
got on their feathers. At first the young birds uttered loud querulous
cries which I was afraid would keep the crew awake all night. Eventually
they quietened down and I hardly ever heard them utter these crie&amp;
after the first four or five days. They were all extremely lively except
just after they had been fed when they all huddled up together and slept.
It was surprising to see the assiduous way in which the birds preened
not only themselves, but their companions. As mentioned before,
the young birds exactly resembled the adults in plumage, also the bill
was the same colour, a bright yellow, but was soft and fleshy. The birds
squatted on their " heels " and there seemed to be a small pad similar
to that mentioned by Beebe, which he noticed in nestling Toucans.
The nestling birds seemed to feel the heat of the lowlands very-
much and I always kept them in the shade or in a darkened room. In
spite of this I lost one of the best while in Port-au-Prince where the
heat was terrific.
The Collared Amazon nests in holes in the highest forest trees,,
far out of the reach of any enemies except the native boys, who mark,
down the trees and watch the progress of the young birds with a view to&amp;gt;
taking them to rear and sell eventually in Kingston. The price seems
to be about 10s. to #1. Two or three eggs seem to be the usual
clutch.

These hybrids were bred by Mr. R. Anderson, St. John's Hill,
Wanganui, New Zealand. The photograph of the extended wing is
particularly interesting, showing, as it does, perfect feather formation
which too often is not the case with aviary-bred Parrots. Mr. R. Ander-
son is to be congratulated on his repeated success in breeding these
fine birds. We should much like to hear which predominates, the
red and yellow or the blue and yellow, when the birds are in colour.--

By The Hon. Mrs. Henry Broughton
Early this summer I purchased a newly imported cock Malachite
Sunbird and in the perfect ignorance which is bliss carried him out
every morning to swing on a hook in a fairly sheltered angle of the
house, with several other birds likewise swinging. At the same time
I procured two pairs of newly imported Lesser Double Collared Sun-
birds, and they were subjected to the same rough treatment, planted
without ceremony on a ledge attached to the house and fully exposed
to wind and sun for the entire day, sometimes until after dark. How
long they would have survived this treatment I do not know, but
fortunately for them I went away for six weeks and the birds were
left in the care of a great expert, who restored them to me in perfect
health.
Then I discovered spiders were much liked by Sunbirds--my
husband became an expert in catching them, and from that moment
the Malachite Sunbird ate out of my hand literally. He gets wildly
excited at the sight of the match-box or bottle containing the spiders.
Flying backwards and forwards uttering his lovely watery call, he eats
as many as are offered him, the result of much toil gone in a few seconds
--then, highly delighted with himself, he flies round the room, soaring

up to the ceiling to catch a fly to round off his unattractive but
healthy meal.
He is the most charming bird. He has never shown the slightest
fear of my two golden cocker spaniels who are always with me--in
fact the Malachite often flies down and walks about on the carpet
quite near to where the dogs are lying. He ignores strangers equally
and flies out of his cage and sets about his fly-hunting just the same
if the room is full of people or empty except for me. The room is a
large one with many windows and filled with orchids, and the Malachite
is a lovely sight as, with a true sense of his own decorative value, he
flies from flower to flower.

It has always been somewhat of a puzzle to me how birds tell
w r hat time of day it is. This applies especially to the breeding season
when male and female take more or less regular turns first at keeping
the eggs, and later the young, warm. What tells the male bird, for
instance, how early in the morning to fly to the nest in order to relieve
his mate, who sits on the eggs all night, and so enable her to get food
and water ?
For answer to my queries, I turned to a pair of Harlequin or Cape
Doves that thrive in a large outdoor aviary together w T ith many kinds
of Finches and some Canaries. In flight these graceful little Doves,
with their hesitating wing motion and their very long, slender tail,
look like huge butterflies. The habitat of this charming little Dove is
tropical and Southern Africa.
It so happened that for several weeks my work during the forenoon
took me near these Doves' aviary so that I had ample opportunity
to tell quite accurately at what time each morning Mr. Harlequin
would attempt to coax Mrs. Harlequin to leave her precious eggs.
Sometimes he had to coax her for a long time, but of that later.
My observations proper began on the first day of August when two
small white eggs appeared in a nest consisting of a few twigs carelessly
thrown together. It was built atop a little wooden box 5 feet above

the ground in an aviary with a solid roof. Nine-thirty said my trusty
watch that first day, but the following day, to my surprise, the male
bird relieved his faithful mate at 7.45. At first he sat quietly on the
corner of the nest-box. Then he began carefully to edge his way into
the nest until he finally sat beside his mate, who seemed reluctant to
leave it, as if she did not trust him very much. The morning of the
third day was cloudy so that the sunlight did not enter the Doves 5
flight until quite late. It was therefore no great surprise to find the
male Dove beginning his daily incubation at 9.32. However, the next
day, which was sunny, found him taking his place beside his mate,
who for some reason known only to herself would simply not leave her
plain abode at 7.40. Having waited in vain for ten or fifteen minutes,
lie flew away and did not return to the nest until shortly before nine
o'clock, at which time he had no trouble whatever in inducing his hand-
some wife to let him take his turn at incubating.
On the two succeeding mornings, both bright with sunshine,
Mr. Harlequin went to work promptly at 7.45 and 7.48 respectively, thus
indicating that the length of his stay on the nest is probably governed
by the brightness of the prevailing light. On these two occasions, the
female, instead of leaving the nest slowly as usual, flew off quickly
at the* approach of her mate. Apparently she was hungry and did not
have to be urged to relinquish the nest for a time.
Even though the sun shone brightly and early the morning follow-
ing, it was not until 8.44, or approximately an hour later than on the
preceding day, that I saw the Doves exchanging places on the little
nest. And, lo behold, the day after that my timepiece pointed to
9.41. " Why so late on this clear morning, Mr. Harlequin ? " I felt
like asking. For answer he continued to sit very still, eyeing me
nervously as if to say, " If you don't want my good mate to work from
this moment on and all the rest of this long day, you had better not
come any closer." At no time during the period of observation did
the birds exchange places again at so late a time. The figures for
the succeeding mornings are as follows: 8.12, 7.40, 9.2, 7.50,
8.50, 8.15, and 8.32.
As soon as young appeared in the nest, the male practically went
on a vacation, for I found his mate doing most of the brooding in the

day, in addition, of course, to the all-night brooding which most female
birds do. It seemed that shortly after the eggs hatched, the male found
the female more and more unwilling to entrust the care of her two
children to him. Not infrequently he would sit beside her for from
twenty to thirty minutes, ready to do his part in keeping the chicks
warm, but their mother would simply not be relieved of her duties. So
Mr. Harlequin left and took the rest of the day off.
It is quite apparent that the male of this particular pair of Harlequin
Doves does not take his home duties and work too seriously, arriving
at the nest anywhere between 7.40 and 9.40. Nor will he wait more
than thirty minutes for his mate to make up her mind as to whether
she wants to leave the nest or not. A handsome but lazy husband this
particular Harlequin, whose sense of time, while perhaps not remarkable,
is nevertheless well developed.

By P. J. Lambert
The Editor of the Avicultural Magazine has kindly asked me
to write a few lines on the Pheasants that were shown at the Crystal
Palace Show and I am very pleased to do so. First I will say that this
was an unqualified success. In only one case was a Pheasant's plumage
disarranged, this was a Swinhoe cock, which bird had evidently caught
its tail in the bars of the pen, but I do not think the tail feathers were
actually broken. All the Pheasants shown did great credit to the
exhibitors. I wall just touch on a few of the winners. Naturally pride
of place must be given to the very handsome Edwards cock that won
the coveted prize, viz. the cup for the best Pheasant in the Show. This
was presented by our President, Mr. G. Blay, is called the " Blay "
Cup, and incidentally was won by Mr. G. Blay, surely a happy result ?
This cock was in perfect condition, for its plumage literally shone.
I use the word " shone " for the feathering of this beautiful cock
Pheasant would appear to do so. It is the great feature of a bird that
is not renowned for gay plumage. Several fanciers who had never
seen an Edwards cock before called my attention to the green lustre

of the wing feathers. It was in perfect condition, not nervous
but moved about in its pen in a manner that suggested it was
desirous of appreciating the honour that had been bestowed upon it.
Personally, I am delighted that a Pheasant of almost sombre plumage
should win the special cup, for I sometimes think that many Pheasant
fanciers and others are inclined to worship at the shrine of " gay
plumage " rather than study and appreciate aesthetic beauty. In
the A.O.Y. Class a magnificent Vieillot Fireback cock was placed second,
and it was an outstanding bird, in splendid condition, and showing
to perfection the points that are so obvious in all Firebacks, dignity
of carriage and, may I say, masterfulness. This Pheasant was only
imported in 1935 and its condition reflected great credit on the owner,
Mr. Blay. The third in this class was awarded to a delightful little
Chinquis Peacock Pheasant. In this case it was surely of great credit
to exhibit a P.P. without a ruffled feather. These Pheasants are very
light of feather and imperfect handling can so easily ruin the appearance
for many months. This little cock was much admired by all, and one
heard many exclamations of delight that such a little gem should be
on view. Would that it had displayed to the onlookers, that would
indeed have caused a sensation.
The Amhersts had a class to themselves. There were only three
exhibits, but all were very fine specimens of this most wonderful bird.
Indeed, I should not have cared for the task of adjudicating the prizes
in this class, and the O.P.S. was fortunate in obtaining the services
of such an expert as Mr. Seth-Smith. M. Delacour suggested that
another year the Pheasants should be prepared for the Show before-
hand, in order to accustom them to the show bench. This matter will
have the attention of the O.P.S. Committee, for certainly one or two
of the Amhersts and Goldens were nervous. The Amhersts were
greatly admired. What bird lover indeed could pass an Amherst cock
without an exclamation of delight ?
A fine show of Golden cocks almost illuminated the Pheasant
section. Flashes of gold, yellow, scarlet, dark green, black, crimson,
and brown, what else could be expected from such a blaze of colour ?
The little cocks were mostly quite happy in their pens and elicited
" rounds of applause ". They were not unduly alarmed and at times

one would notice a cock standing perfectly motionless, the bright
sparkling eyes gazing in wonderment at the human beings who dared
approach them so closely. At one time I noticed six or seven visitors
watching these cocks, on each face there was a smile. The Golden is
such a happy little fellow and it would seem this happiness is imparted
to us human beings who have the pleasure of gazing at such beauty.
In this class again Mr. Seth-Smith had no easy task. There were many
beautiful specimens. Condition told, and also I am inclined to think
that one or two of the crests were somewhat light in colour. The
wonderful carriage of both Golden and Amherst cocks is a remarkable
feature of these Pheasants, the very perfection of grace and dignity.
I am sure this was taken into consideration by the judge. The winner,
owned by Mrs. Sams, was a specimen which carried itself as only a
Golden cock can. Besides the Pheasants mentioned there was a
magnificent Argus cock ; unfortunately this had to be shown in a hall
adjoining and many visitors did not even know of its existence, which
was to be regretted. There were twenty-four exhibits in all, and surely
this is a happy augury for future shows. I have since heard that every
Pheasant arrived at its home in good condition.
The thanks of the O.P.S. are due to Mr. G. Blay for exhibiting so
many rare Pheasants. His example will, we feel sure, be followed by
many next year. The Show was in every way a great success.

The O.P.S. held a most successful general meeting at the Crystal
Palace on Friday, 24th January. Over thirty members attended and
if we take into consideration the fact that the C.P. Show was held
during the week that King George died, this number was most satis-
factory and far exceeded our most optimistic hopes. It was a happy
feature that many members travelled long distances in order to be
present, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Dorset, Leicestershire, Hampshire,
and Northamptonshire were counties that had representatives present :
it was very encouraging to the committee. We were very pleased to
welcome M. Delacour, who made the j ourney from France in order
to be present at the meeting : we think this was very kind of him.
I would mention here that M. Delacour has invited members of the

O.P.S. to visit his aviaries at Cleres in the late summer, this will prove
a most popular expedition.
Many matters of interest were discussed at the meeting. It was
hoped by many that a booklet would be issued in the near future, but
it appears our finances will not permit of such a venture at present,
but the matter is only temporarily shelved.
Members of the Avicultural Society will be interested to know
that many members of the O.P.S. have availed themselves of our
offer to send out on loan copies of the Avicultural Magazine. In
fact this venture has become so popular that I have been forced to
ask some of our members, who are also members of the Avicultural
Society, to lend me their copies in order to keep pace with the demand.
I think this " lending library " will prove of benefit to your Society,
for many of our members who borrow a copy will naturally be anxious
to obtain a copy that they can keep, so they will join the Society.
I think a report of the Pheasant Section of the C.P. Show is appearing
elsewhere in this issue, but I should like to mention that the O.P.S.
provided special baskets for use of members who were showing Pheasants.
These baskets were made good use of, and every Pheasant that was
shown arrived in good condition and not a tail feather was broken in
transit.
I am sure the Show was a revelation to many people who had never
seen Ornamental Pheasants before, undoubtedly the Pheasant Section
was a great draw. I was there every day of the Show and it surprised
and pleased me to find so many visitors took an intelligent interest
in these birds. Next year we shall of course support the Show again
and I feel very confident that the entries will be very numerous. I
should like to take this opportunity of expressing the thanks of the
O.P.S. to Mr. Seth-Smith for the able manner in which he judged the
Pheasants, his decisions gave universal satisfaction.
Finally, the Avicultural Society are being very helpful to us, and
it is most encouraging to note that we are receiving the support of the

The loss of Herr F. Blaauw, the veteran Dutch naturalist and
aviculturist, will be deeply felt all over the world. One of our oldest
members, Mr. Blaauw has contributed many interesting articles to
our Magazine since its beginning. His private Zoological Park at
Gooilust, near Amsterdam, was one of the best in the world. Provided
with an abundance of water and sheltered by immense beech trees
on which Herons and Cormorants nest in large numbers, it contains
a famous collection of Waterfowls and Cranes, as well as aviaries
where Hawks, Ibises, Game and Passerine Birds were kept and often
bred. Most species of Geese have been reared there for the first time
in capitivity and it is partly thanks to Mr. Blaauw's efforts that the
Trumpeter Swan was saved from extinction, young birds bred at
Gooilust having several times been sent to America and liberated in
parts of their native haunts, whence they had unfortunately dis-
appeared. Besides birds, there are at Gooilust very interesting mammals,
particularly White-tailed Gnus and Przevalsky's Wild Horses, and
also plants, most of which have been brought home by their owner
on his return from his many travels to different parts of the world.
Several of Herr Blaauw's studies on birds have been published in
the Ibis and in French and German scientific periodicals, while his
monograph of the Cranes, written in English, is well known to all
ornithologists.
It is greatly to be hoped that Gooilust with its collections will be
preserved as a national monument for the people of Holland.

MR. SETH-SMITR'S MOUSE TRAP
In the August number of our Magazine, Mr. Seth-Smith described his
wonderful trap, and as it happened I was being plagued to death by an
invasion of these little pests, I set to work, and after some difficulty procured
a supply of 64 Little Nipper 55 traps, which I think were slightly larger than
those described. I found that to make them work properly the pedal had
to be taken off and a little rough ledge at the hinge of the pedal filed away.
When this was done we caught any amount of mice, sometimes three in a
four-trap box at one time. Soon we had the mice under control, but I still
keep the traps set, and now and then get an odd one. I think everyone

troubled with mice should make a few of these box traps, and I know they
will bless our late editor for giving us his secret, as I have done.
I have just come across a most efficient cat trap which I hope to describe
fully later on. Cats, I think, are the greatest pest we aviculturalists have
to deal with, especially where one keeps birds about the garden in a state
of semi-freedom.

PHEASANTS WITH OTHER BIRDS

<bodyText confidence="0.996435714285714" page_id="56289554"  page_num="92" year="" vol="">
In the January issue of the Avicttltural Magazine I made a statement
that ornamental Pheasants could be kept in aviaries with small birds and
that nothing untoward would happen. Mr. Spedan Lewis in the February
issue very kindly sends a warning to aviculturists. He kept a Peacock
Pheasant cock with a very valuable Elliot's Pitta ; after a month or so of
perfect harmony, the former killed the latter. Perhaps I ought to have
qualified my assertion, for it would seem that in some cases this may prove
an expensive experiment. But in support of my statement I may be allowed
to say that this instance of the Peacock Pheasant cock killing this beautiful
Elliot's Pitta is the first instance that I have heard of a deliberate murder
under similar circumstances. But I will admit that when I suggested this
procedure I certainly ought to have added that valuable and rare small
birds should not be exposed to the danger that I suppose must be present,
when they live constantly with birds of much larger build and in some cases
furnished with dangerous spurs. My remark applied to the commoner
Budgerigars, Finches, etc.
In the case of Peacock Pheasants, these very harmless looking little
pheasants, delightfully garbed as they are in quaker -like grey, are at times
most vicious and anything but peaceful. I also have good cause to know this.
I once ran a five-month old P.P. cock with seven four-month old Amherst
chicks. I was away from home the day I made this move and on my return
in the evening I discovered that four of the poor little Amhersts had been
murdered by the Peacock Pheasant cock. I will add that although I have
found that I can mix all species of ornamental Pheasants when young, the
one exception is the P.P., these I invariably keep in separate aviaries.
I am very glad that Mr. Spedan Lewis was thoughtful enough to warn
us, I might have received an account for the loss of some valuable small birds.

Had I been as unfortunate in either the keeping or the breeding of birds
as, on his own showing, Mr. A. G. Butler appears to have been, I would
certainly have given up aviculture in despair long ago. But that is not to
say he is always wrong in his statements and, in the case of Cherry Finches,
I venture to suggest he is more correct than Mr. Boosey who, in the February
Magazine, questions Mr. Butler's description of these chastely beautiful little
birds as " one of the hardiest and most easily managed of Australian
Finches ".
Though my own experience in keeping and breeding a number of birds
of this species can hardly be as extensive as Mr. Boosey's, so far as it goes it

agrees with Mr. Butler's. I grant that, until fully acclimatized, they are certainly
very delicate but, once established, I have found them not only very prolific,
but quite as hardy as any other small Australian hardbills. Though I have
never attempted to winter them out of doors, I have kept them in perfect
health and feather all the year round in an inside aviary where heat was
only used in extremely cold weather, and, under those conditions, and fed
on the ordinary menu provided for a mixed collection of foreign hardbills,
they never showed any signs of ailing. Their prolificacy may be gathered
from the fact that, last season, one pair produced and reared to full maturity
eight strong youngsters. These were reared without any live insect food,
beyond an occasional mealworm, and never gave me the least trouble or
anxiety.

Catreus wallichii (Hardw.)
In P.Z.S., 1858, both the egg and chick of the Cheer Pheasant are figured,
the latter hatched in the Gardens. In the account it is not very clear how
the chicks were hatched or even if they were reared, but the article is headed
" On the Indian Pheasants bred in the Menagerie ", And Beebe in his
Monograph of the Pheasants, vol. iii, p. 63, confirms that it laid eggs and
reared its young in the London Zoological Gardens in 1858. Gould, Birds
of Asia, vol. vii, also states that the present bird bred in the Gardens of the
Zoological Society, at Viscount Hill's, at Hawkstone, and at Earl Craven's,
at Ashdown ; Lord Craven also obtained a cross between this bird and the
common Pheasant. So it seems to have been reared a number of times in
England during the nineteenth century. I notice that Elliot also figures
the newly-hatched young. Mr. Stallard does not tell us how his birds were
hatched, did the parent bird sit and hatch and rear its young or were the
eggs placed under domestic hens or other means employed ? Is it not an
understood rule that young must be reared by their own parents in order to
be entitled to the Society's Medal ?
T. H. Newman.
[According to the Zoological Society's Vertebrate List, eighth edition, the
Cheer Pheasant was bred in the Gardens in 1862, 1863, 1865, 1866, 1867,
1868, and 1881.--D. S-S.]

I was much interested in Mr. J. Spedan Lewis's letter on the occasional
danger of keeping Pheasants in small birds' aviaries. Although they nearly ;
always are harmless, there are a few cases where they prove decidedly
impossible. It is all a question of species, of individuals as well. In my
own experience, only one species, the Cheer, is really dangerous; they
deliberately catch and eat small birds. Last summer at Cleres, a pair of
Cheers shared an aviary with a large collection of Waxbills, whose numbers
were unaccountably decreasing. We thought that they were escaping through
some hole in the wire netting, which, of course, we could never discover, till
one day, we saw both cock and hen Cheer seize and devour three or four
Waxbills before our eyes.

Another case was that of a hen Elliot which, at my old home at Villers-
Brettoneux, many years ago, we caught killing and eating a whole brood
of newly hatched Californian Quails. This, of course, was exceptional, as
Elliot's are usually very quiet.
It is therefore advisable to watch carefully at the start those Pheasants
that are associated with small birds, and if the latter are very small and
very precious, it is safer to keep them by themselves, as, at any rate, Pheasants
may frighten and disturb them when they fly clumsily in the aviary.

The Budgerigar vies with the Canary as the most popular small
pet bird kept to-day. Its beauty is undeniable in all its forms, and it
has the further merit of being a " no trouble bird
Budgerigar breeding has assumed enormous proportions, tens of
thousands are reared annually in cages and aviaries, yet breeders have
no difficulty in disposing of good healthy surplus stock, for the demand
seems insatiable.
In such a hobby as this a really comprehensive and authoritative
work dealing with every aspect of Budgerigar breeding and exhibiting
is most welcome, and a book just published by Cage Birds," entitled
The Cult of the Budgerigar , 1 fills this want to perfection. The author,
Mr. W. Watmough, is a well-known successful exhibitor, breeder, and
judge of these birds.
The book contains six coloured illustrations depicting ideal
specimens in different colours, as well as other illustrations in half-
tone, two of which are especially useful as they depict and point out
" show-faults " and are, it is believed, the first of their kind to be
published. The practical advice, covering every detail of housing,
feeding, rearing, training, and general management, makes it possible
to breed and exhibit the best type of bird, even without previous
experience.
The Cult of the Budgerigar may safely be regarded as the only
standard work on the market which deals in a really comprehensive
manner with these charming and popular little Parrakeets.

inhabits northern Australia where, together with the numerous other
small Finches which come from that region, it is sometimes very
numerous and at others scarce, according to the season of the ripening
of the grass-seed ; while in times of drought it is said to frequent
the coastal regions and appear in large numbers at the drinking pools.
This handsome Finch seems to have been first imported into this
country in 1896 when it caused quite a sensation amongst aviculturists.
Subsequently fair numbers arrived though it has always been regarded
as a somewhat uncommon bird and in the last few years appears to
have become rare. The first to breed it in this country was Mrs. Howard
Williams who successfully reared a brood in 1905 from a nest made
in a rush basket, and published an account of the event in this magazine
of December, 1905.

{Concluded from p. 82)
Our next place of call was an obscure little port, and as soon as
tbe native traders came on board offering their fruit, I hailed a canoe
and was taken over to the mainland, where I endeavoured to find
a drug store. Fortunately there was one, where I purchased a small
rubber syringe. As not many white people seem to have reared
" Amazons 55 from the nest, a few notes on the rearing of these birds
may be of interest. I had eight young birds in all and, with the
exception of one which died through the excessive heat when in
Haiti, I reared all of them. I discarded the bone end of the syringe
and used only the rubber ball with a short narrow neck. This proved
an excellent way of feeding the birds and from then onwards they
were no trouble. At first they lost a little weight, but soon picked
up again. Later on I mixed a teaspoonful of Mellin's Food with the
ordinary food mixture, but I doubt whether this really suited them.
The birds were fed four or five times a day. The two species of
Parrots were kept together and the difference in the plumage was
very apparent. The green of the " Yellow-bill " is a bright shining
golden green, while that of the " Black-bill " is a rich, glossy
laurel green.
Parrots which are hand-reared make delightful pets, especially
the " Amazons These birds are quite devoid of fear of human beings,
yet so deeply rooted is their instinctive fear of snakes and other
creeping animals that they are terrified of any animate object
resembling these creatures. One can watch their characters and
idiosyncrasies develop like those of a child. True, most of the
" Amazons " which are seen in this country are hand-reared, but by
natives ; there is a great difference between a bird reared by a
native and that reared by a white person. As mentioned before, one
thing very noticeable in young " Amazons " is the care given to the
plumage, and as soon as they can stand on their feet they are most
assiduous in their preening.
I know of no difference between the sexes in the plumage, except

that one or two of the larger and stronger birds which might be males
have a few bright orange feathers on the bend of the wing.
The Jamaican Conure (Eupsittula nana). --Only in certain districts
is this little Parrakeet at all plentiful, St. Ann's district on the northern
side of the island being one of them, where dense forest covers the
precipitous mountains. From the rest of the island the birds seem
to have disappeared. I made extensive inquiries, but was unable to
locate a single one in captivity, even in the region where the bird is
still found. There is little doubt that in the course of time this little
bird will be completely exterminated, for it is persecuted by the natives
on account of its feeding upon the young corn. Flocks of these birds
can be very destructive, each bird breaking open many heads of corn
and eating only a few grains from each one.
The birds seem to nest in the large earth nests of a certain ant.
These nests are a very conspicuous feature of the countryside, and
are placed either on the trunk of a tree or on a horizontal branch.
The bird cuts into these and there makes her nest. I was told by
several natives that the birds feed their young on the larvae of the
ant. Statements by natives are often very unreliable, so I cannot
vouchsafe for the truth of it.
The Ani (Crotophaga ani). --As in most of the other West Indian
islands, this bird is very common and is found about the pasture lands,
following or perched on the backs of horses and cattle. I was told
that the use of poison dip has resulted in the death of a great many
of these birds, as they partook of the poisoned insects after the cattle
had been dipped.
It is a most amusing bird, holding impromptu parties and often
having games at hide-and-seek in the dense bushes. The greatly
accentuated upper mandible is used for ploughing up earth and manure
in search for insects.
The Cayman Island Paerot ( Amazona caymanensis). --In the old
parson's garden, where I secured many Jamaican birds, was a Parrot
cage made out of a petrol tin and in it was a specimen of this very
rare Parrot. I was told that the bird had been taken in lieu of a debt
of #1, which a dusky inhabitant of Kingston owed to the parson, and
that there was little likelihood of the bird's being redeemed.

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
Needless to say I quickly offered to relieve the debtor of any further
responsibility, and also give him a good profit into the bargain. The
old parson was very conscientious, and refused to part with the bird
until he had consulted the owner. Eventually the owner consented to
part with the bird on condition I paid his debt. The wretched bird had
been fed only on mango skins and stale bread, and very little of that too.
No species of Parrot is confined to such a small territory as this one.
The Grand Caymans are a group of many very small islands which
lie between Cuba and Yucatan, but are adminstered by Jamaica.
The Cayman Islanders are noted for being some of the finest sailors
known, and schooners from the Caymans often visit Jamaica, and in
the old days used to bring some of these small Parrots over. I was
told that these birds are seldom, if ever, brought over now and birds
of this species are very rare in Jamaica. Besides the pair in the Jamaica
Institute, the one I secured seemed to be the only one in Jamaica.
There is little doubt that this bird will soon become extinct, for besides
the destruction of the trees on the Caymans, these islands are visited
by terrific hurricanes, which take a great toll of the bird life.
This is one of the most beautiful of the smaller " Island Amazons ",
and is allied to the bird from Cuba, but it differs considerably in size,
being much smaller, the white on the forehead being much restricted,
and not being a pure white but mixed with pink, black, and yellow.
The bird which I possess has the breast mostly a wine red, the feathers
edged with green.
The Long-tailed Humming Bird (Aithurus polytmus ).--Any
visit to Jamaica by a bird-lover is incomplete unless he sees the
crowning glory of the island's wonderful avifauna, the Long-tailed
Humming Bird. Not only is it one of the most beautiful of the whole
family, but it ranks as one of the world's loveliest birds. A little more
than 4 inches long, it possesses a tail very similar to that of a
Whydah, rather like that of the Pin-tailed Whydah.
The general colour is the deepest velvety black and an amazing
scintillating emerald green. Iridescent green is common in Humming
Birds, but not the green of this bird, which appears in the living bird
like a brilliant green light. On the head is an arrangement of crests
and tufts very difficult to describe. Another very striking feature is

the brilliant coral pink beak which is tipped with black. The two
long tail feathers hang down as though slightly weighted. The inner
web of these feathers is puckered or undulated as though it had been
passed through a goffering iron. It is an amazing spectacle to see these
tiny birds hovering before the flowers with the long tail hanging down
and hardly moving. One would think that such a caudal appendage
would interfere with the flight of such an active creature as a Humming
Bird. I did notice in my brief acquaintance with this bird that it seemed
to perch a great deal, the long tail feathers often hanging over a branch
as the bird rested.
In the distance and in the shade of the trees the bird appears quite
black, as indeed most Humming Birds do. It is only when the sunlight
catches the plumage that the full beauty is revealed. This bird does
not appear to be common on the southern side of the island. I used
to make inquiries regarding it, but was told by every one that it had
gone from that side of the island.
This species is fairly common in certain districts which are on the
northern slopes of the island, and at the edge of the forest lands at a
considerable height above the sea. In his Birds of Jamaica Gosse
gives a long and very interesting account of how he tried to keep this
species in captivity, but unfortunately all his efforts were doomed
to failure, chiefly on account of his failing to supply the birds with
the minute insects upon which they mainly feed.
As with all Humming Birds the nest is a most beautiful structure,
sometimes placed on a twig, or, correctly speaking, I should say built
round a twig ; sometimes it is built from a hanging tendril or lina.
The Mango Humming Bird (Anthracothorax mango ).--This fair-
sized Humming Bird is the commonest of the Jamaican Hummers, in
fact this species is found on most Of the West Indian islands. I usually
saw it around the banana plantations of the natives busily engaged
in sucking the nectar from the banana flowers. At least that is what
they appear to be doing, but in reality Humming Birds feed mainly on
the minute insects which they find feeding upon the juices of various
tropical flowers.
The natives call this Humming Bird the " Doctor-bird ", why,
I have no idea. Like all other members of the family this bird is

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
extremely pugnacious, and two birds will, upon seeing each other,
start a violent aerial combat and will not case until one or the other is
vanquished. I have seen these birds attack Hawks and even Eagles !
The flight of these birds when in pursuit of one another is incredibly
swift. Like the other Hummers, this species appears to be black at
first sight, but when in the right position and the sunlight falls on it,
the breast appears like a glowing ember shining through black.
The Minute Humming Bird (Mellisuga minima). --There seems to
be some dispute whether this is really the tiniest bird in the world.
I did not see it owing to shortness of time on the island, but I did see
the skins and its body is certainly not larger than that of a humble bee,
in fact its total length including the tail and long beak is slightly
over 2 inches. It appears to be the least common of the Humming
Birds in Jamaica, and is only found in certain districts. A lady whom
I met near Falmouth, on the north coast, and who was a keen student
of the bird life of the island, said that there were two species of this
tiny Humming Bird. She explained to me the intelligence shown by
the bird in the construction of the nest, which is so tiny that it is
scarcely large enough to insert the tip of one's little finger. The nest
is so camouflaged that it is almost impossible to find one. If the
nest is built on a tree fern, the outside will be stuck all over with the
fine hairs from the trunk, or if built where it is surrounded by moss,
the bird will cover the nest with bright green moss. Should the nest
be built where there is no immediate material for harmonizing it with
the surroundings, the bird will procure from a distance material which
will render the nest, if not invisible to the casual observer, at least
very inconspicuous. Gosse in his Birds of Jamaica speaks of these
Humming Birds as extremely numerous, but they must have greatly
decreased since his day in 1845.
The Jamaican Golden Warbler (Dendroica petechia). --This lovely
little golden bird makes its home in the humid mangrove swamps on
the coast. To those who do not know the tropics mangrove swamps
stand for something fetid and pestilential; in reality they are anything
but that, and these strange marine woods form the home of many
types of life and can, if one has the inclination, form a fascinating
place of study.

Amongst the sombre greenery, the brilliant plumage of this little
warbler makes it resemble a golden ball hovering about in the gloom
of the woods. The birds must have been breeding when I was in
Jamaica, for I saw many adult birds feeding their young, which were
less gold in colour than their parents and had chestnut markings on
the breast.
The Palm Swift ( Tachornis phoenicohia). --This is one of the
commonest birds about Kingston. It was the first bird which attracted
my attention on leaving the ship, for flocks consisting of many hundreds
were flying low around the sheds on the wharves. I suppose that the
sugar stored there is a great attraction to various bees and flies, etc.,
which the birds were catching. The birds fly with such swiftness
that it would be impossible to identify them were it not for the very
conspicuous white band across the back. Nothing seems to disturb
the birds ; they fly in and out amongst the hundreds of noisy natives,
trucks of sugar, and motor cars which keep coming and going all
the time.
In the afternoons when the sun gets hot the birds stop their
peregrinations, and do not appear again until the early morning. These
birds make their nests at the base of the palm fronds, of a kind of
felt which the bird manufactures by a mixture of its own saliva and
cotton down from the seed pods of various trees. With these birds
flying round the sheds was a much larger Swift of a dull brown colour,
which I could not identify.
The Jamaica Tody ( Todus todus). --This exquisite little creature is
locally designated " the Robin ", but a bird more unlike a Robin
would be hard to imagine. The Todies comprise a small family of very
peculiar little birds confined to three of the West Indian islands. They
are brilliant pale green in colour with a vivid scarlet throat, a very
long and flattened bill, and long hairs or whiskers which spring from
the base of the bill. The total length of these birds, including the
long bill, is only 4 inches.
Gosse in his Birds of Jamaica tells of a specimen which he kept in
captivity for some time and which lived on small flying insects in his
room. In an ordinary cage I think it would be impossible to keep
these tiny birds alive.

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
The Tody seems to have but feeble flight and sits in one place,
taking short excursions after flying insects as they pass. These frail
little birds are remarkable for the fact that they burrow into the
soil to make their nests. Usually the nest is made in a bank like that
of a Kingfisher, though sometimes boxes, which have been used for
growing plants and have been left full of soil, are used. It is amazing
that this tiny creature, only the size of a Humming Bird, should have
the strength to tunnel into hard soil.
It is a pity that this bird is not common, for they must do a great
deal of good by killing an immense amount of abnoxious insects,
such as mosquitos, etc. Todies are such peculiar little birds that no
description can give an adequate portrayal of their unique appearance.
Sitting still on a leafy branch they are very difficult to distinguish
from the foliage. A very striking feature is the pale grey eye, which
seems to turn round almost like a chameleon's.
The Jamaican Woodpecker (Centurus radiolatus ).--This extra-
ordinarily handsome bird is common in Jamaica. I saw it many times
in the woods and also had the good fortune to see a pair nesting in
the stem of a dead palm-tree in the garden of a house situated in a
remote district in the parish of Trelawney. These birds, I was told,
had chiselled out a hole near the summit of the trunk, but were driven
from it by a pair of Caribbean Martins (.Pronge dominicensis), whole
crowds of these birds coming to assist the original pair in mobbing
and driving the Woodpeckers from their lawful home, until at last
these latter birds were forced to quit their nesting hole, and start
a fresh one a few feet below their original home now tenanted by the
Martins. After this the two species of birds lived together amicably
as neighbours and reared their respective families. The head of the
palm-tree in which the birds had made their home had been blown
off in a hurricane and the trunk stood like a lone telegraph pole in the
centre of the garden.
The birds were quite tame, and it was very amusing to watch them
endeavouring to entice the young ones out of the nesting hole. One
of the parents would arrive with a beak full of insects, alight on the
trunk some feet below the hole, quickly run up to the entrance, show
them the food, calling all the while, and gradually back away

endeavouring to get them out, but in this they always failed. Both
parent birds each time they left the nest took away with them a large
beakful of some dark brown material which looked rather like
Christmas pudding ! The hole made by the birds was perfectly
symmetrical and I was told it took several months to excavate.
Besides insects, these birds feed on berries and fruit; the owner of
the house told me that she frequently saw the birds bringing beakfuls
of the red Cordia berries to feed the young upon.
This is a large Woodpecker and most beautifully coloured.
The Jamaican Cliff Swallow (Petrochelidon fulva poeciloma ).--
In large holes which had eroded in the soft limestone cliffs above the
rushing Rio Cobre were large colonies of the nests of these birds.
These nests, which were flask-shaped, were built in clusters of six up
to several dozens, and looked rather like the earthernware jars of some
primitive race stuck on to the face of the rock. There must have been
hundreds of nests on the face of the cliff, and at the time I visited the
place the young must have been about full-grown. Nearly every nest
contained three or four young ones with their heads hanging out of the
neck of these flask-shaped nests. There were hundreds of adult birds
flying back and forwards to the nests supplying insects to the hungry
young. There was also another smaller species of Martin nesting with
these birds, and their nests were of somewhat different structure and
were built close to, but did not join on to, those of the Cliff
Swallows.
March's Black-faced G-rass Finch (Tiaris bicolor marchi ).---The
little bird is common everywhere and is the " Sparrow " of Jamaica.
Its strange cricket-like song is heard on every hand though the bird
is not always seen, for it frequents the ground amongst the weeds and
grass, where it feeds upon the minute seeds and, no doubt, small
insects. Not only do its habits render it very unobtrusive, but its
colour makes it more so, for the male is a dull greyish olive with a dull
black head, neck, and breast, the female is even plainer and lacks the
black, being just a dull olive-grey slightly lighter on the under parts.
The ordinary person in Jamaica does not think this bird half as
common as it really is for, although, like the English Sparrow, it is
found around human habitations, unlike that bird it seems very loathe

to show itself and only when one is almost treading on it does it rise
out of the low herbage.
In its habit, size, and general demeanour it resembles a Waxbill,
its nest too resembles that made by those birds---an untidy structure
of loosely thrown together stems of fine grass, etc., with an opening
at one side.
This bird being terrestrial in habit, the legs and feet soon get
deformed and scaly if kept in captivity in an ordinary cage and
denied the use of soil to move about on. I bought three pairs of these
birds, but on arriving on the ship I found one dead though apparently
in perfect condition. Later, one escaped, and I am afraid was caught
by the ship's cat. I found them extremely pugnacious and it was
impossible to keep more than one pair together, the birds fighting
and nearly plucking each other bare. The two pairs I have in my
bird-room. They are not very interesting, but I am hoping that they
breed next year when put into an outside avairy.
The Olive Finch (Tiaris olivacea ).--This is another familiar cage-
bird whose acquaintance I made for the first time at liberty. In
certain parts of Jamaica it is even commoner that its congener, the
Black-faced Grass Finch, a bird to which it is closely related, but
as though conscious of its greater beauty it is far more conspicuous
than the latter bird, neither does it frequent the environs of towns
as much as the other bird, being found more around the homesteads
in the country and by the sides of roads and lanes outside the villages
in the interior of the island. Its song, while being of the cricket quality
of the other bird, is easily recognizable.
The Olive Finch is also sociable and is found in small flocks or
family parties. When disturbed they take refuge in the nearest clump
of weeds and seldom fly far away. The nest is a bulky, roughly made
structure, domed and with the entrance at one side.
The Yellow-backed Finch (Sycalis flaveola ).--This beautiful
little Finch, which at first sight resembles a Siskin, is apparently not
common and I only saw but few examples. I saw one pair at West-
woods, the school already referred to. Here the bird had built a large
and untidy nest in an orange tree, but it was placed in such a position
that it was rendered very inconspicuous to the casual observer.

Unfortunately this bird, in common with other Jamaican birds,
is decreasing, owing to the natives copying their so-called superior
white neighbours and indulging in the thrilling (?) sport of killing
little birds. Not only boys, but grown-up natives make expeditions
into the country armed with catapults and endeavour to outdo each
other in the number of small birds they kill.
The Louisiana Heron ( Hydranassa tricolor ruficollis). --This small
Heron is very numerous in Jamaica and is found by nearly all the rivers
and streams and often in the brackish inlets in the mangrove swamps.
Numbers are seen together, not in the manner of a flock, but they just
seem to congregate where the food is most plentiful. Unlike the
ordinary Heron, which watches motionless for its prey, this species
wades and scrambles about in search of the small aquatic life upon
which it feeds. I noticed several birds immersed in the water up to
the top of the neck in the rushing streams. This bird is particularly
fearless, and examples may be seen searching for food in the estuaries
of shallow rivers which run through the middle of the small coastal
villages. The birds wander about in the water only a few yards from
the dusky laundresses who seem to be perpetually washing the family
linen (and no doubt, metaphorically speaking, their neighbours' as well!)
in every freshwater stream in Jamaica.
The Little Blue Heron ( Florida cseulea caerulescens). --This
beautiful bird was only observed by the Rio Cobre, some miles from
Kingston. It does not seem so common as the smaller Heron, neither
is it as tame, for on the sight of a human being, there is a flurry of
wings and it is soon out of sight. This is the only Heron I have come
across which, from a distance at least, appears a true blue. I think
this bird lives more by fishing in the orthodox Heron manner than its
smaller congener.
The Florida Gallinule ( Gallinula choropus subs) -- 1 This lovely
bird is not uncommon on the freshwater pools and small lakes in
Jamaica. Although I did not see any of the birds in a state of liberty,
I saw an example owned by the old black parson in Kingston. It was
in a small aviary and in perfect condition though it had no access to
water. I was rather tempted to purchase it, but having a good many
birds and expecting to purchase more in Haiti I left it. This I rather

regretted, as I picked up only a few Parrots in this latter country.
The bird is about the same size and shape as the European Water Hen
and is a beautiful purple and green in colour with exceedingly long
legs and feet, red in colour, which rather resemble a Jacana. This
provision of Nature enables the bird to walk with ease over the floating
aquatic vegetation.
The Least Grebe ( Colymbus dominions ).--On a remarkable lake
near Moneague, which had appeared about eighteen months before and
inundated an area of about 800 acres, covering villages and plantations,
and which is now receding, I first saw this small Grebe. There was a
small family party of these birds and their nest was on the top of a
dead tree which was just on the level of the surface of the water.
This small Grebe is very common in Jamaica and is found wherever
there are stretches of fresh water. On the appearance of a stranger
the bird dives at once and remains under the water for an incredibly
long space of time. Once I watched one in the Rio Cobre. It got so
exhausted by repeated diving to escape our notice that it finally
emerged in such a bedraggled state that it was unable to dive again
and just floated away on the river.
The Antillean Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps
antillarum). --Only one specimen of this bird was seen, also on the
Rio Cobre. It is at once identified by the conspicuous pied bill; it
is also much larger than the other Grebe. It also appeared much
tamer than the other bird and I believe it is rather rarer.
The Brown Pelican (. Pelecanus occidentalis).-- One of the first
birds one sees on approaching Kingston is this Pelican, and what extra-
ordinary creatures they look sailing in the clear morning sky. They
certainly look at a distance more like some prehistoric reptile, a
Pterodactyl, more than any ordinary living bird. The flight consists
of a few leisured wing beats and then a long glide. The head is held
back and the huge beak thrust out from the breast. But no description
of this bird can adequately explain the weird and reptilian appearance
of it on the wing. In Kingston Harbour they can be seen on most of
the buoys, and all manner of posts, standards, etc., which mark the
courses for the ships. They fly in a regular line formation like Ducks.
The fishing is done from the air very much like that of a Gannet.

Although I sailed all round Jamaica I did not see these birds anywhere
else other than in the Kingston Harbour. Evidently they have greatly
decreased since Gosse's time in 1845, for he wrote that the birds were
found in the greatest numbers all round the coast.
It is an amazing sight to see these huge birds fishing. They dive
from a height like a G-annet. Soaring over the ocean they will, upon
seeing a fish, drop with closed wings like a stone into the water. The
amazing thing is that they can rise up immediately out of the water
with no exertion again into the air. There is no laboured flapping of
the wings like a Gannet or Cormorant.
The Jamaican Mocking Bird ( Mimus polyglottos orpheus). --This
is one of the commonest of the Jamaican birds and is a great favourite
on account of its melodious song. It is one of the first birds that
attract the notice of the stranger, both by its song and pale grey
plumage and its habit of flying to the topmost branches of the trees.
In Kingston it is very common, being seen in the main streets and in
all the parks and gardens. On account of its vocal powers it is known
as the " Nightingale
Of other birds seen, the Tyrants were the most common. Jamaica
boasts of quite a few species of these birds, which are usually known
under the name of " Tom Fools " and vary in size from that of a
Blackbird to a Flycatcher. They are very conspicuous from their habit
of taking up a point of vantage on the top of a tall tree and from there
making excursions after flying insects.
The Jamaican Grackle ( Holoquiscalua jamaicensis ) is another
very noticeable bird but not very common. It is of a Starling-like
appearance, glossy black in colour with a striking white eye. It is
extremely quick and businesslike in its demeanour as it searches for
insects in the grass, reminding one of the Starlings on the lawns at home
except that it is much more alert and quicker in its search for food.
The Little Honey Creeper ( Cceraba Jlaveola), as in most of the
other islands, is very common here and can be seen searching the
tangled masses of creepers for the tiny insects upon which it feeds.
It differs very little from the species from the other islands.
Of the two Thrushes one, " Hopping Dick 53 or the Jamaican Ouzel
(Haplocichla aurantia), is fairly common in the wooded districts, where

its loud notes can often be heard and the bird seen in the dense forest
trees. It is rather similar to the European Black, but the black
plumage is relieved with white on the throat, wing coverts, and under
parts. Much less seen than the foregoing is the very striking " Glass
Eye " of the native or Jamaican Thrush (Turdus jamaicenses), a bird
with an extraordinary glass-like eye, hence the common name. This bird
is found only in the mountain recesses and seldom near the habitations
of human beings. The old black parson had a very fine specimen of
this bird, but he refused to be tempted by any price, saying that the
bird was now very rare and if he parted with it he would be unable
to get another. I believe this bird has a very fine song. Of the
magnificent Man-o'-War or Frigate Bird ( Fregata magmficens) I saw
many specimens flying over the beaches and mangrove swamps on
the north coast. These birds spend a good deal of their time resting
on the tallest branches of the mangrove trees. They are often
encountered on tropical oceans great distances from land. In spite
of their great wings and almost complete aerial existence, the birds
seem rather clumsy on the wing ; they give the impression that their
wings are too big to be properly controlled. The feet of the Frigate
Birds are so weak and inadequate that they only walk with the greatest
difficulty.
Mr. Mowbray, of Bermuda, had one of these birds as a pet; he
had had it for over two years and it was brought in the first place
from the Cocos Islands. The bird lived by a turtle pond, spending
most of its time on a perch about 18 inches from the ground. It some-
times flew from the perch into the pond and only with the greatest
difficulty was it able to get out again. From the ground to the perch
was a small ladder to enable the bird to get back again. To do this
appeared to be a great effort, the huge bird taking tiny hops with its
inadequate feet and taking a considerable time to mount the small
ladder. Though full-winged the bird never flew away. It was fed on
live fish, which, with the almost perfect climate, no doubt accounted
for its surviving for so long.
I also saw several specimens of the Coot ( Fulica caribsea ) which
is found on the island : these birds somewhat resemble the Coot
of this country, but the frontal shield is bright red. These birds

appear fairly tame and I used to often watch a family party in the
mangroves near Falmouth. The young birds, not having learned the
ways of the world, were much more confiding than their parents.
Haiti
A more uncongenial place than the " Black " republic of Haiti
cannot be imagined. The least said about this very disagreeable
country perhaps the better. Its one compensation is, or rather was,
that it possessed a unique avifauna, but little of it is now seen by the
casual traveller for the greater part of the magnificent forests which
once covered this very mountainous land have been destroyed; the
only remaining portions being on the high mountains bordering the
neighbouring republic of San Domingo, where the main remnant of
the vanishing avifauna still holds out. In the rural districts one is
lucky to see any birds at all and at the best it is usually only a fleeting
glance as some terrified feathered creature flashes by to safety. It is
not without significance that the Southern Vulture, though existing
in the neighbouring islands of Jamaica, Cuba, etc., is not now found
in Haiti. These birds possibly did exist, but were unable to compete
against the human harpies who now inhabit the land, so died out.
The chief occupation of the rapacious islanders appears to be the
robbery of visiting foreigners. It is also rather significant that one
sees very few really old people. This is possibly due to the fact that
when a person reaches the age when he or she is incapable of being
imposed upon, their throats are slit or they are quietly put away !
Those people who talk a great deal about government by native
races would do well to take a holiday in Haiti, and after a few weeks'
residence would, like the writer, be very glad to pack their bags and not
without a sigh of heartfelt relief, quickly and quietly slip away.
I had previously made a theoretical study of the birds of Haiti,
and hoped to see something of their habits in a wild state, but finding
that the Haitian allows no opportunity to pass to impose on or rob
the foreigner, I quitted the island with my object unfulfilled.
Nearly every bird is killed by the natives for food, and when making
inquiries about the rare Hispaniolan Conure (Aratinga chlorojptera),
I was always told, " Bird no good only to eat." The only birds I saw

S. Porter--A West Indian Diary
before I left the island in disgust were a few specimens of the Black-
faced Grass Finch or March's Black-faced Grass Quit. One misses these
little birds, which are so common in Jamaica and whose call can be
heard on every hand, both in the town and country. The few birds
I saw were excessively wary.
Another characteristic bird of the inland mountainous district is
fhe Palm Chat ( Dulus dominicus), a bird allied to the Tanagers, but
very unlike them in habits. It builds amazing nests at the base of the
fronds of the Royal Palms, between the stems of the seed pods and the
base of the fronds. These huge nests are the work of many birds and
are communal, many birds inhabiting the same nest. These nests
are a very conspicuous feature of the landscape. This is one of the
very few birds that can be called at all common. Why the natives have
not killed this species out I can't imagine, unless they have some
superstition about it, but one cannot imagine superstition standing
in the way of a Haitian when it came to a matter of food. Another
bird which is occasionally seen is the Palm Crow (Corvus palmarum),
a very small-sized Crow with a peculiar flight which lives in the wooded
parts near the native plantations. It is not common and is not found
near villages or towns.
A bird which I was astounded to see in Haiti in flocks of con-
siderable size was the African Black and Yellow Weaver (Textor
cucullatus). These birds are common and one sees in the country
large trees stripped of their leaves with many hundreds of nests
attached to the branches. One of the most remarkable sights in
bird life I ever saw was a large flock of these birds all seeming to be
flying in formation, each with a very long piece of palm frond in its
beak trailing far behind the bird. These the birds were taking to
weave their nests with. How this Weaver first arrived in Haiti will
ever be a mystery, but possibly it was brought there by the French
when they owned the country many years ago.
In the days when the peaceable caribs inhabited Hispaniola and
when the vast forests covered the mountains a small Parrot of the
" Amazon " family commonly known as Salle's Amazon ( Amazona
ventralis) was found in enormous numbers all over the two, now modern,
republics of Haiti and San Domingo. With the coming of the Spanish,

the human inhabitants were soon massacred, and few were left to tell
the tale after the Spanish quitted the island. From the time the
Spaniards set foot on the island the forest commenced to be destroyed,
and gradually the feathered inhabitants were driven farther and
farther back into the interior. The Parrots were doubtless killed in
large numbers for food as these birds were on every other West Indian
Island, and to-day, though one sees a good many birds in the possession
of the inhabitants, it is by no means a common bird, except in the far
interior. Most of the birds one sees in the capital, Port-au-Prince, are
brought by native traders from the neighbouring republic of San
Domingo, where the bird appears to be still common in the dense
forests. The Parrots in Port-au-Prince are either kept in petrol tins
made by the native tinsmiths into horribly inadequate cages, or the
bird is kept at liberty with a clipped wing on a suspended perch on
the patios of the houses. The birds thus kept are usually in good
condition and many talk. The birds in the petrol tin cages have a less
happy fate and are fed only when the owners think about it, and that
is not often ; then they received bits of mango skin, stale bread, or
pieces of yam or sweet potato.
All the birds owned by natives are perfectly tame on account of
their being procured from the nest and hand-reared. I could have
purchased many such birds at upwards from a dollar each, but as
I had already over a dozen Parrots, I only purchased three birds--
what seemed to be a true pair and an odd bird which talked in Spanish.
One of the birds was a youngster not long taken from the nest. This
Parrot rather resembles the Collared Amazon from Jamaica, but lacks
the salmon-pink colouring, also the green is darker and more heavily
marked with black ; the blue on the head is also darker.
A bird familiar to all travellers in the Western Seas is the tiny
Wilson's Storm Petrel (&amp;lt;Oceanites oceanicus), which follows in the wake
of the ship, systematically quartering, in a ziz-zag course, the surface
of the ocean which has been churned up by the ship's propellers,
obviously on the look out for small marine life which has been dis-
turbed. Their flight never falters as they sweep from side to side only
a matter of a few inches above the surface of the ocean. What remark-
able creatures the Petrels are ! at home in the midst of the most

terrifying storms, seeming to fly just beneath the cap of the waves,
and one expects every moment to see them swamped, but such an
occurrence never seems to happen. Spending nearly all their time on
the watery wastes of the world, one would think that Man would be of
little account in the lives of these birds and yet probably no family of
birds has suffered so much at the hand of Man as the Petrels have and
their history as far as Man is concerned is one of extermination. Most
species nest in burrows on small islands and as soon as these islands
were occupied by Man the young Petrels were used to augment the
daily bill of fare. Not only that, but in the West Indies, Australia,
New Zealand, and South America, great quantities of these birds in
the nestling stage were, and still are, collected and preserved for food.
Hence many species, especially the West Indian ones, have been
exterminated and others reduced to a remnant, for in the ordinary
course of events petrels had few enemies and were consequently slow
breeders, most birds producing one young one each year, and at the
most two, so that most species were not able to stand the continued
drain on their numerical strength. The food of the Storm Petrels
consists of minute crustaceans which the birds pick up while on the
wing from the surface of the ocean.

Encouraged by the interesting notes by Mr. A. C. Furner in this
January number of the Magazine, I have dared to send a few dis-
connected items of news from my own very humble collection.
The photograph is of an eyass female Goshawk, Brunehilde by
name. She came over to me from Germany about the middle of
August, and as she came by air mail, arrived in very perfect condition.
She was very wild and nervous at first, but constant carrying and
infinite patience gradually got on the right side of a dreadfully tiresome
temperament. I began training her for work early in September, and
on 7th October she took her first wild rabbit. Since then till now,
4th January, her bag is two hares, one weighing 8 lb., and twenty-
three rabbits. She would have taken a great many more rabbits if

one could have found the time to take her out. She is very obedient to
the lure and has never kept me waiting more than twenty minutes,
and then only once, after missing a rabbit. She works in amicable
concord with my spaniel and a large ferret.
My other Hawk is a Peregrine Falcon. I have only had her a week
or two, but as a trained eyass in 1934, she took sixty-one Grouse, ten
Mallard, and fifteen Cuckoos. So far we are only making friends,
and hers is a very much easier temperament to deal with than the
Goshawk. Last May I saved the lives of two young Sparrow-hawks,
who were about to be done to death by a keeper. These two birds
I trained, and both were taking Sparrows by the end of August, and
were quite steady and obedient to the lure. Unfortunately both
birds came to a sad end. One hung herself in a high tree by a broken
leash, the other appeared to injure herself in pursuing a Sparrow
through a thick bush ; she died a week later.
The season of 1935 from the breeding point of view was not very
interesting here.
A pair of Golden Pheasants were very prolific, the hen laying
twenty-five eggs: twelve young were ultimately raised to the adult
stage, together with four Amherst. It was my first attempt with
Pheasant chicks, and I found them easy to rear, lettuce being a great
help. Any casualties I suffered came from cats. Zebra Finches reared
a few young very late in the season. Two Bullfinch hens, paired to a
Linnet and a Mealy Redpoll respectively, built and laid and sat, but
there were no results. A hen Siskin paired to a Mealy Redpoll
had three fertile eggs and raised two young to a week old, but forsook
them after that. A pair of Indigo Buntings built a nest, but no eggs
arrived, or mice had them. A pair of Cuban Finches built vast nests
all over the place, but stopped then, and a pair of Avadavats nested,
but eggs were infertile. A cock Greenfinch paired to a small Canary
and reared four very dull mules.
A pair of Alexandrians laid two clutches, but no result. The
cock, I am pretty certain, was the failure.
I procured a very rough, sad-looking bird in August. I was told
he was a Blue Mexican Whistling Thrush. He was in a shocking state
when he arrived, no tail, no flights, and very patchy elsewhere, his

head and neck covered with what looked like tiny ticks or feather
lice. For ages I couldn't get a feather to grow ; but after a few weeks
in a cold greenhouse, on a diet of a good insectile mixture, Virol, and
rabbit's liver, he began to improve and now is almost in perfect
condition. He is about the size of our Jay, a dark blue all over, with
grey flecking on head and neck, large strong black legs, a yellow beak
(pale), lower mandible greyish, large full black or dark brown eyes.
So far the only attempt at conversation is an absurd Thrush-like
sibilant squeak. I gather he does not hail from Mexico, but India or
China, but I wish I could find out more about his kind. He is, I am
sorry to say, a murderer : he has eaten a blue Mountain Grosbeak.
I had no idea he was that kind of person, but I ought to have been
more careful, as the fondness for rabbit's liver should have given me
the clue. He is a friendly soul, nevertheless.
The birds indoors at the moment consist of a pair of Red-headed
Gouldians, a Superb Tanager, and an old Shama cock, a great
character.

By Mrs. Cox
The following is an account of a somewhat unusual friendship :--
A young Leadbeater's Cockatoo, hatched and reared here in 1935,
was removed from the parent birds at the age of four months (by
which time they took no further interest in him), and placed in another
aviary, the sole occupant of which at that time was a cock Lady
Amherst X Golden Pheasant.
I was not sure to which sex the Cockatoo belonged, as until
they reach the age of twelve months I find the eyes do not attain
their true colour ; in consequence of which they are extremely hard
to sex. The bird, however, has proved to be a hen.
For the first few weeks after the Pheasant and the Cockatoo met
they kept at a respectful distance from one another, afterwards a
period of indifference set in, relieved occasionally by the Cockatoo
stalking the Pheasant and trying to frighten him by pretending to
swoop down on him, but never quite touching him. Later I would

sometimes see the Pheasant's tail being gently pulled. Some months
elapsed and the friendship between this strange pair has gradually
developed into something almost more.
During last summer they were observed to roost in the open shelter,
sitting close together, and the Cockatoo was seen frequently preening
the neck and head feathers of the Pheasant, and imploring him to
respond. He appears to accept the attentions in the spirit in which
they are meant, but continues to maintain an aloof but friendly manner
towards her.
In August, 1935, I placed a cock Leadbeater's Cockatoo into the
same aviary. She accepted him with interest and they appear to get
on well together, but when night falls the cock bird retires to the
closed shelter for the night, and the hen still roosts close beside her
original friend the Pheasant, whose habit it is to spend his nights
on a perch in the open flight, unprotected from wind, rain, or frost;
this strange performance has continued throughout the winter.
I am wondering what is to happen when the Cockatoos are moved
to their breeding aviary very soon.

TAME LOVEBIRDS
By Helmut Hampe
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.9994093" page_id="56289589"  page_num="117" year="" vol="">
Tame Budgerigars, as is well known, make delightful pets.; soon
there will be hardly a house which does not contain its talking specimen.
It is astonishing what a great variety of speech these little Australians
can master, indeed few other Parrots can vie with them. Many other
species, however, can be made as tame, the various Lovebirds for
instance. They all become perfectly tame and affectionate, provided
of course that they are properly managed, especially if they are taken
from the nest at the right moment and hand-reared.
It is not my intention to describe how to do this in this article,
so I will only say that Lovebirds take far more readily to artificial
feeding than Budgerigars do ; they usually take the warm mixture
at once even if they are four weeks old, which very rarely happens with
Budgerigars of that age. This naturally makes hand-rearing the
Agapornidas, much easier, and though their training began so late they
become just as tame, provided they are kept strictly separate and
receive sufficient attention. They then become far tamer than most
Budgerigars and are never so happy as when they are with their
masters. They give a great deal of pleasure, but are unfortunately
fond of employing their powerful beaks in gnawing and nibbling one's
fingers, a habit which after a time becomes insupportable even when

only done in play. Hens are particularly prone to it, it being their
nature to peel bark for nest-building : they try it on every possible
substance, including their masters' fingers. They simply cannot leave
it off. If interfered with they grow angry and bite in real earnest, as
indeed they do whenever they are displeased. I have found this to
be the case with all the hens I have reared; cocks are considerably
gentler though naturally they bite strangers who meddle with them,
but they never hurt their owners, provided that they have not been
spoilt. They dislike to be teased and must have consistently gentle
treatment and consideration for their idiosyncrasies. They never lose
their individuality and submit themselves absolutely to their masters
as a dog does : their tamer must reckon with this if he hopes to keep
perpetually on good terms with them and have real pleasure in them.
The tamest of the many Agapornidae that I hand-reared was a
cock Fischer's Lovebird. I described his and his sister's juvenile
development in Vogel ferner Lander, 1933, and also gave a sketch of his
behaviour. This bird, named " Pansa ", had several wives and a
whole galaxy of children ; his first mate was a hen Black-cheeked,
likewise hand-reared, his next a hen of his own species, and the third
a hand-reared Peach-faced. Pansa was unfortunately crushed in a
door when he was only three years old and had four nestlings. Only
one hybrid lived to grow up, a large handsome bird on the whole,
most resembling its father. While Pansa and the Peach-faced were
breeding he made up to a tame Abyssinian hen, fed her, and showed
her affection ; he would probably have paired with her but for his
unfortunate death. Pansa at least demonstrated that hand-reared
birds can be used for breeding : he carried out his duties in every
particular, nor did any of the hand-reared hens fail in theirs.
After Pansa's brood was reared the above-mentioned Peach-faced
paired with a Madagascar Lovebird and after that had two young by
a Peach-faced. She was only six months old when the first brood
was reared.
Hand-rearing does the birds no harm unless it is badly carried
out, which unfortunately is often the case, for the majority of bird-
fanciers have neither the time, experience, or patience which are required
to make it completely successful.

There is a possibility that the hand-reared bird will not mate with
its own kind, but prefers human society. This does happen, and it
may be that the instincts of a perfectly tame bird have been so far
changed that even when it has paired a normal brood is doubtful and
unlikely. For instance, Pansa always wanted to help in feeding his
nestlings directly they were hatched, whereas a cock Lovebird does not
normally undertake this duty until a good deal later.
He insisted on going into the nest-box as soon as the young were
hatched, greatly to his wife's displeasure, who refused to let him
approach them. Every time wild screaming and quarrelling took
place until the uninvited guest was driven out. It was a matter of
astonishment to me that the young were not injured on these occasions.
Whether Pansa really intended to feed or to pluck and nibble them
I cannot say; if the latter it was an abnormality not caused by his
tameness, but a consequence of captivity, for it is well known that
many Lovebirds have this unnatural habit of devouring the feathers
and skin of their young. Pansa did it to the older nestlings.
Pansa naturally lost some of his tameness through being paired,
but as for some months previously he was kept single and had become
very attached to me, it did not make much difference. To the end
he always flew first on to my shoulder as soon as he was let out and
busied himself with me. He did not go so often to my wife unless she
was sewing, when his delight was to catch hold of her needle and
unthread it. He partook of everything at meals and was extremely
importunate. When he w r as satisfied he flew back to his cage in order
to feed his babies. The tame hen, of course, accompanied him except
when she was sitting. I could even take him into the garden ; he
flew away once and we got him back through an advertisement, but
after this he would no longer let himself be held nor would he nestle
in one's hand ; this was probably not so much the consequence of
shyness due to mating as because I had sometimes picked him up
hastily and shut him in. That all birds resent and remember this is
common experience.
Pansa and even more his tame hen fiercely defended their nest
against me, which made control difficult; even feeding was not too
easy, because every time a hand was put in to change a food vessel

both birds dashed furiously out of the nest-box to drive it away.
Hands were particularly regarded as enemies and to some extent
considered apart from the person to whom they belonged. Our tame
Lovebirds scarcely ever seriously bit our ears or lips, but most of them
would bite a hand if it approached them while they lay in the other.
The two hands were evidently looked upon as separate entities, one
friendly, the other an enemy, or perhaps another bird.
As a rule the tame Lovebirds treated strange birds wdth complete
indifference. Pansa, however, did not object to the society of some
young Budgerigars which I had taken in order to hand-rear them ;
he fed them freely and displayed to them, and he did the same when
coloured Budgerigars were introduced to him, so did a tame Grass
Parrakeet. I observed Pansa's first attempts at pairing when he was
three months old, and the hens at the same age frequently put them-
selves in position for pairing, so that the question of sex can easily
be decided by this behaviour provided enough time is devoted to
watching and studying the birds. All other indications of sex are
uncertain, at any rate where young birds are concerned.
Pansa and the other Lovebirds sometimes attempted to hold things
" in his hand " but he was very clumsy at it and never, like so many
Parrots, carried the food to his beak ; instead he stood upon it to
steady it while he bit off mouthfuls from it.
In his youth Pansa often stuck twigs and similar objects in his rump
feathers, then he left it off, but when he was three years old he recom-
menced it to a much greater extent. If such observations were made
oftener perhaps it could be determined if the group of the four Love-
birds with white circles round the eyes are particularly near relations
of the Peach-faced, for in their habits and voice and especially in the
appearance of the young there are resemblances which do not exist
with the other species.
Pansa unfortunately never learnt to talk, but we did not take
much trouble with his education. In any case Lovebirds have little
aptitude for speech and cannot compare with Budgerigars. Only a
few talkers are known, and I have only had two Black-cheeked, both
hens, which could say " Come here " loudly and indistinctly. Neither
do they readily mimic sounds, a lack for which their other pleasant
qualities amply atone.

The election for the committee of the O.P.S. has resulted in the
following being elected : P. J. Lambert, 87 votes ; Gr. Beever, 80 votes ;
Captain Scott-Hopkins, 74 votes ; J. C. Bennett, 56 votes ; P. C.
Mackie, 55 votes ; Mrs. F. C. Burchett, 52 votes. Since the number of
votes was published in Cage Birds I have received several more cards,
which bring these members 5 numbers to a higher total. It is rather an
interesting fact that all these elected are also members of the Avicultural
Society. Nearly one hundred members availed themselves of the vote,
and this was quite satisfactory, for it will be realized that many new
members would hardly know by name any of the candidates and such
could not be expected to vote. I am sure that this new committee will
be a combination of enthusiastic Pheasant fanciers and people who will
be ready to work hard for the benefit of the common good of the O.P.S.
Many members are anxious that an exchange board be set up at
once; such an innovation will prove extremely profitable, and will be of
great assistance to members who are desirous of introducing fresh blood.
I am sure that it is not realized to the full that breeding from related
stock is most harmful ; Plumis " in Cage Birds has repeatedly pointed
out the ill-effects of such procedure. Since mentioning the fact that an
exchange board may shortly be set up, I have been surprised at the
number of fanciers who have written me and asked whether I can
arrange for such exchanges. I have been able to effect many changes,
and this owing to the public spirit of one or two members. The ultimate
result of such an exchange board will be of enormous benefit to the
fancy in general. It will mean that members will no longer have to
breed from closely related parents, and surely if the O.P.S. never did
anything else this achievement would in itself justify its existence.
Members of your Society will bear in mind that many of our members
are unable, owing to lack of means, to buy any Pheasants they may wish
for to strengthen their strain, so what a boon this board will be.

<bodyText confidence="0.958516428571429" page_id="56289596"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
In view of the correspondence which Mr. Webb's article on bird importa-
tion has caused, I feel it my duty to point out that Mr. Webb was to the last
very reluctant to write his views at all, knowing that many aviculturists
would consider such an opinion from a collector as bad taste. However,
after more than a year, I succeeded in persuading him to express views that
belong to us both on a matter which we have many times discussed together.
I consider it very generous of Mr. Webb to give us those views under the
circumstances, and I am glad that aviculturists in the main agree with them.
I am sorry Mr. Venner objects to a more scientific treatment of the
Magazine, for many thinking members will see at once that a society which
does work of economic value is more worthy than one with no ultimate
object. However, I am sure that not many aviculturists will admit, as
Mr. Venner does, that the science of ornithology is unintelligible to them.

EGG-BINDING EXTRAORDINARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997810666666667" page_id="56289596"  page_num="122" year="" vol="">
I have just had a rather extraordinary case of egg-binding, and I wonder
if any other member has ever had one like it. On the morning of 15th February
on going into one of my aviaries, I found a Masked Lovebird apparently
dead on the floor--wings spread out and bird quite stiff and cold. I knew this
particular bird had been using a nest-box near the door as sleeping place,,
but I was not sure if it was a cock or hen. I had not shut the aviary myself
the night before, so I could not be certain that the bird had then been quite
well. I picked it up and, being suspicious that it might be a hen and might
have been egg-bound, I pressed it to feel if there had been an egg. Feeling

something there I pressed still harder and the yolk and white of an egg came
away. I then laid the bird down, meaning, when I had finished in that apiary,
to bury her. As I laid her down her beak was partly open and I thought
I saw her tongue move. It seemed impossible and also having, as I thought,
broken an egg inside her, it seemed hopeless in any case. I examined her
again and was sure she was stone dead, but again as I laid her down I fancied
her tongue moved. So, hating to be in doubt, I rushed her in to the fire and
sat holding her in my hand for fifteen minutes before there was a sign of life,
and then one eyelid moved ; I then rolled her in a duster and left her on the
rack above the kitchen range. About an hour later she was most distinctly
alive, not fit to move, but breathing, so I poured three drops of brandy and
three of water into her mouth--I doubt if she swallowed any of it--and then,
still rolled up, I put her in a cage in front of an electric fire. By the afternoon
she could sit and even stagger on her feet and she ate a little millet spray.
Yesterday, 16th February, she seemed better, ate more, and actually sat on
the perch of the cage, and I began to have faint hopes. This afternoon,
17th February, she has laid a semi-soft rough egg, shell broken at one end
and quite square like an envelope at the other, pure white with one speck
of blood on it, and about an inch long, absolutely empty. She now seems quite
fit and has been flying round my sitting-room ; but I have still got her in
front of a fire. On examining the nest-box in which I knew she slept I found
seven eggs--this was apparently her eighth. I should be very interested to
know if any one has had a case in the least like it.

NEWS FROM AN AMERICAN MEMBER
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.90148072" page_id="56289597"  page_num="123" year="" vol="">
Each issue of the Magazine is a delight and I always await its coming
with much anticipation. The January issue was especially interesting
to me because of Mr. Lambert's article on Ornamental Pheasants, and
also the account of Mr. Stallard's successful breeding of Cheer Pheasants,
inasmuch as the Ornamental Pheasant Society of America was organized at
New York on 8th January of this year and appears to be quite successfully
under way.
Officers of the Society are Mr. Philip M. Plant, Waterford, Conn., President;
Mr. Frank Buck, Amityville, L.I., N.Y., Vice-President; and Mr. C. L.
Sibley, Wallingford, Conn., Secretary-Treasurer. Some thirty interested
persons attended the organization meeting and applications for membership
are coming in steadily.
Ornamental Pheasants are very much on the up grade in America
at present, and because of the size of our country and the many and varied
climatic conditions nearly all the varieties so far imported are doing well and
most of them are breeding.
This season Mr. John Robinson, of Aldershot, Ont., Canada, reared success-
fully to maturity twenty-one young Cheer Pheasants. Last year Mr. Robinson
reared some hybrids between the Cheer and the Common Koklass. Mr. Leland
Smith, of Fair Oaks, California, also reared Cheer, Koklass, Satyr, and
Temminck Tragopans, and nearly all the Firebacks. Mr. Jackson, of San
Francisco, California, reared Blue Manchurians in large numbers (as did
several others), a fine flock of Malay Crestless Firebacks (several breeders
have reared these during the last few years, but I have not yet heard of the
Bornean Crestless being reared), Tragopans of various sorts, many Impeyans,

etc. Palawan Peacock Pheasants were reared by several, but I have failed
thus far to hear of any of the Bronze-tailed Peacock Pheasants being reared,
although there are quite a few pairs in the country. Mr. Charles Denley, of
Rockville, Md., reared a nice flock of Malayan Argus, along with several
others of the rarer sorts. Some interesting young reared by Mr. Denley this
season are a result of the Blyth-Satyr Tragopan cross. These are large, and
the cocks, although only of the past season, already show much colour and
brilliance of plumage. Swinhoes and Elliott's have been reared in such numbers
during the last three or four seasons that they are no longer numbered among
the rare sorts. Green Java Jungle Fowls were reared by Mr. Leland Smith
this past season, as they were last also. This Jungle Fowl is suited only to
the warmer parts of our country, and does not thrive in the north, even with
heated quarters in winter. Sonnerat's is rare in this country, only two or
three odd birds being in the country at present. The writer expects to have
some Sonnerat's over from the collection of Professor Ghigi, in Italy, and with
luck they may again become well established in this country as they formerly
were.
Bulwer's are still very rare in this country and have not, so far as my
information goes, yet been bred. Neither have the White Crossoptilons
with the exception of a reported breeding some years ago in the collection of
Mr. Macy. Mr. Leland Smith has a fine pair of Whites, and it is very probable
that they will breed in the climate of California this coming season. Also
at present en route from India are some sixty Pheasants, including Sclater's
Impeyan, White Manchurians, Blood Partridges, Western, Blyth, Temminck's,
and Satyr Tragopans, and others of the rarer sorts. This shipment if received
in good order should give the breeding of some of the rarer sorts a great
impetus.
Mr. Frank Buck, Vice-President of our Society, had a large shipment of
Bulwer's sent over, but on arrival all had perished except one fine cock which
Mr. Buck still has in fine condition.
The Red Jungle Fowl is terribly common, and very cheap in price, and
there is no interest at all shown in theifi by the collectors of the rarer sorts.
Dr. Newill, of Connellsville, Pa., has the Ceylonese Jungle Fowl ( lafayetti )
in some numbers and appears to be succeeding with them. All of the Crested
Firebacks are being most successfully bred by fanciers in the warmer parts
of the country. The writer owns what he believes to be the only pair of
Imperials in the country at the present time. Last season was a failure with
these, for although the hen laid well the cock came into breeding condition
far in advance of the laying season and fertility was poor. Edwards were
bred in some numbers by at least four fanciers this season. In this connection
the writer feels himself fortunate in having reared to maturity nineteen
Edwards from one of his old pairs. We thought this rather a good showing
from a variety which is not too prolific a layer.
Hundreds of fanciers are breeding the commoner sorts in this country,
such as Reeves, Linneated, Silvers, Nepals, Melanonotus, Lady Amherst,
Goldens, Versicolors, Brown Manchurians, Germains, and Gray Peacocks,
etc., and, of course, many of these will continue to develop their collections
by the addition of the rarer sorts from time to time. All in all, the Ornamental
Pheasant fancy seems to be in a healthy state in America, and the new Society
hopes to spread still further the gospel of these most beautiful birds.

GOULDIAN FINCH

Madam,- --I have a cock Gouldian Finch which was freshly imported a year
and a half ago. This bird has been out in an nnheated aviary all this winter
in 18 to 20 degrees of frost and has never looked better ; so that rather proves
it is not absolutely necessary for Gouldians to have heated aviaries. It is
in a large aviary with other birds--Finches and Budgerigars and Long-tailed
Grass Finches ; and many a morning the ice is several inches thick in the
water troughs and the Gouldian seems thoroughly to enjoy it.

DROMANA, VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.996954525" page_id="56289603"  page_num="125" year="" vol="">
Madam, --On reading your Editorial in the November issue I thought
I might be able to send something of interest along for the Magazine from
time to time.
We have several people here in Victoria whose collections are particularly
good, and I think that a few notes about them now and again would be very
interesting reading for aviculturists overseas.
The collection of Pheasants owned by Mr. A. Jaques, of Victoria, is, I am
sure, one of the finest in the world, and his success at rearing them is out-
standing. I should very much like to get Mr. Jaques to give me some notes
for the Magazine. [Please try !--Ed.]
Also we have men like Mr. W. Forster-Woods, Chairman of the Melbourne
Stock Exchange, who, for the sheer love of the birds, has without fuss and
trumpet-blowing imported at great expense some of the finest game birds
ever to come to these shores. Unfortunately game propagation in Australia
is not given the attention it deserves, and although some of these men have
spent small fortunes in giving the country good quality stock to relieve the
strain on our own native game they have not received much encouragement.
It is not through the fault of the Fisheries and Game Department, for
Mr. Lewis, the Chief Inspector, is doing his utmost, but it is really lack of
general interest. I could say a great deal about this matter.
Dr. Clendinnen, the Collins Street specialist, has a remarkable collection
of Parrots and the like, and is an expert as well and is regarded as an
authority, as he is in his own profession.
There are several others who are not only successful business men but have
valuable collections, and know every detail as to how to care for them and,
above all, breed them. Their experiences would be worth while recording.
The letter on p. 314 from Miss Maxwell Jackson is very interesting, and
should give food for thought. Some sort of preparation area for bird fife may
be a sound idea if run on efficient lines, and in charge of capable enthusiasts
who do not make # s. d. the first consideration, and if the project had the
backing of genuine aviculturists and official recognition of respective govern-
ments, who would be able to take the word of the person in charge that all
stock was sound and healthy and true to name, and was going to people who
knew how to care for it, then a great deal of trouble and loss of valuable bird
life would be eliminated.
We are not all perfect, and some are more fortunate than others in
having the money to enjoy aviculture to the full, but the love of wild life must
come from the heart, and our first consideration should be for the birds them-
selves and how best we can all unite to make them contented, and to try as
far as possible only to transport acclimatized mated stock that has every

chance of breeding under proper conditions. The locality and conditions could
be the concern of the board in charge of the preparation area in the country
to which the stock is exported.
In this way I feel sure we would often be able to send a few pairs of healthy
stock which, owing to some stir being caused through a badly managed
exportation, come under the general ban, and rightly so ; for public opinion on
cruel exportation is very strong.
But straighten out the whole business, stress the tremendous importance
of propagation as a preserver of the balance of Nature, and the vital necessity
of bird life in the destruction of pests. Then the business man, the farmer,
in fact all, even people who have never kept a bird in their life, will realize
and learn through the publicity that such a scheme would draw, that
Aviculture is an asset to any nation.
Later on I will send some notes on the care and breeding of some of our
native fauna, and herewith enclose a few photos which may be of interest.
All photos were taken on my sanctuary and propagation area at Dromana.
Douglas Picking.
[We shall all welcome further notes from Mr. Picking on the care and
breeding of birds on his Fauna Reserve. It is good to know that there is so
much interest taken in Aviculture in Victoria, and we wish the enterprising
owners of these fine collections of birds the success they deserve in propagating
them.--E. F. C.]

IS YEW DANGEROUS IN AVIARIES ?
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.988211074074074" page_id="56289604"  page_num="126" year="" vol="">
Madam, --You mentioned your distrust of yew for birds and I have heard
others remind me of its poisonous nature. Nevertheless I do like it for birds
other than parrot-like. Take the following facts regarding this year alone ;
early in February (9th or 11th), I found several young birds lying on the lawn
under yew trees, evidently young Thrushes, or possibly Blackbirds, killed by the
rather severe frosts. They were well grown and partly feathered. The parents
had nested in yew. A Blackbird's nest is apparent in another yew close to
our side door, and from the frequent journeyings of the parents, they have
young to feed during the past two or three days. In aviaries and cages I use
yew branches because I have an abundance but I do wonder if there is not
some special virtue in it, possibly good heat-retaining properties on account
of its resinous substance and multiplicity of fine twigs. A pair of Zebra Finches
bought in the ordinary way and chosen more or less at random about the
beginning of December, insisted upon building a nest in their cage, 36 inches
long. To my astonishment three fully fledged young ones flew out on
14th February. Bengalese in a similar cage have gone to nest unusually early,
and hatched young ones about the same day. In both cases there was a
betwigged branch of yew propped up in the corner of the cage. I have noted
a partiality for nesting in branches of yew in other years, and have never
had to blame it for any accidents. I wonder what the general opinion is.
J. E. Haine.
[It is, of course, well known that wild birds use yew trees for nesting in
with impunity. The danger in aviaries lies in the fact that birds living under
artificial conditions do occasionally bite and swallow substances that they
would not touch if they were at liberty. I found one or two bushes of C.
macrocarpa answered the same purpose as yew in my aviaries and had the
merit of being harmless.-- Ed.]

THE RUBY LORY (Vint kuhli)
By J. Delacour
:Samoa and the neighbouring islands can boast of the miniature
Lories of the genus Vini, as small and pretty, in a different way, as
those of the Tahiti group. More to the north, Washington and Fanning
Islands are the home of a lovely species of the same genus depicted
&amp;lt;on the opposite plate. Our readers can easily judge of its bright
.colouring and graceful shape. But only those who have seen the
specimen now in the possession of the London Zoo can have an idea
of its delightful ways. Tame and gentle, it plays like a kitten ; it is
indeed the most wonderful pet that I ever saw.
It is now a very rare bird in its native islands, and it is a wonder
that we could ever see one alive in London. It does not seem to be
delicate if well fed, and thrives well on the usual Lory food of milk,
honey, and fruit.
According to Mivart, some years ago, a good many Ruby Lories
were exported to the more southernly islands by the natives who came
*every year to gather coco-nuts. They used to catch them in nooses after
they had been attracted by a tame call-bird. " When caged aboard ship,
they exhibited as pretty a picture of love as one can imagine. They
,sat billing and smoothing each other's feathers for hours, and as night
.came on two would get together and sleep with heads turned towards

each other. They lived in confinement but a very short time and bore
it badly. At times, even while we stood watching their lively antics,
one would tumble off its perch and die, apparently in convulsion.
The islands on which these birds are found are very small, and it would
not require a very great effort totally to exterminate them."

The past year has been a " red-letter " one with me, as I have at
last realized a twelve-year-old ambition and won an Avicultural
Society Medal for breeding the Royal Parrot Finch. An account of this
has already appeared in the Magazine (September, 1935), up to the
successful rearing of the first young bird, the survivor of a brood of two.
Early in July the parents went to nest again, this time in a small wooden
box hung on the back wall of the inside shelter of their aviary. On
10th July they were sitting on three eggs, and I first heard squeaks
from the newly hatched young on 29th July. On 5th August I had a
look into the nest with my throat lamp and mirror, and found the three
chicks just feathering. Next day I went away for my summer holiday,,
leaving my birds in the care of my old gardener, who is an excellent " bird
man ". The three young Parrot Finches flew about 20th August. While
I was still away one got tangled in the nest and my man was just in time
to save a tragedy, as he noticed it hanging by one leg at the entrance
in time to save it. When I came home on the 27th all three were flying
about in perfect fettle. I left all four youngsters with the old birds
outside until the second week in December. The weather then began
to be bad and one bird got a chill and died ; I had made the mistake
of leaving them out a week or so too long. The first young bird, a cock,
was now in full plumage, and the old cock occasionally chased him
away from the hen or the food pans, but there was no serious bullying
and they are still together in the indoor aviary. A second young bird
died in January, and I am left with the old pair and a true pair of
youngsters.

Other breeding successes during the season were with Cuban Finches,
twelve reared ; Greater St. Helena Waxbills, two ; Bengalese, six ;
Cherry Finch, one reared by Bengalese ; Bichenos, two ; Black-cheek
Lovebirds, ten. Aurora Finches nested three times and hatched, but
failed to rear seven chicks; in each case they deserted them after a day
or two ; on the last occasion I transferred the two babies to Bengalese,
but although they lived a few more days their foster parents also failed
to rear them. They probably needed considerably more live food than
they got; Bengalese feed their own young almost entirely on
regurgitated seed and a little soft food. Cordon Bleus laid several
clutches of eggs, but failed to hatch any. A pair of Pagoda Mynahs
also laid several clutches of pale blue eggs in an old Budgerigar nest-
box, making a nest of green privet leaves, but the eggs were all clear ;
I don't think they made much effort to incubate; they were very wild
and were possibly interfered with by other inmates of their aviary.
Another failure was with a pair of Silver Pheasants; the hen duly laid
a clutch of eight eggs, which I put under an alleged broody hen, who,
however, only sat for a week and then deserted and spoilt the eggs.
A hen Queen Whydah laid several small white eggs in various
nesting receptacles, but nothing, of course, came of them as there
were unfortunately no suitable foster parents breeding at the same time
in that aviary, or possibly the first Queen Whydah might have been
reared in captivity. I did not find the eggs in time to put them under
Bengalese, and should not have known whose they were had she not
laid in a shew cage later on.
A pair of Saffron Finches built a neat nest of dried grass stems and
root fibres in a Budgerigar box, but the five eggs, marked rather like
a Skylark's, were clear.
The pair of Cuban Finches in the same aviary as the Parrot Finches
nested directly they were put outdoors in May, and went steadily on
until taken indoors in October. They used throughout the same nest,
a coco-nut husk hung under the roof of the open shelter, lining this with
shreds of felt from an old piece of carpet felt hanging on the shelter
door ; they hatched five nests of from two to five youngsters and fully
reared twelve of them. I found that the cock started to bully the
young birds when the next nestful were getting feathered. It was very

difficult to catch up the active little beggars to remove them from their
parents' wrath. On one occasion a couple of them slipped out of the
aviary door and spent most of the day high up in an acacia tree over-
hanging their aviary. An all-wire canary cage baited with millet
sprays was put on top of the aviary with a piece of black thread
tied to the open door, and myself at the other end of the thread ; half
an hour's patience and they were safely inside the cage.
At this time of the year one is anxiously making plans for the coming
season, and perhaps " counting chickens The following possible
breeding pairs will go into their outdoor aviaries at the end of April:
Spreo Starlings, Black-throated Cardinals, Boyal Parrot Finches, Cuban
Finches, Greater St. Helenas, Aurora Finches, Bengalese, Cordon Bleus,
Spice Birds, White Java Sparrows, Chestnut-breasted Finches, Saffron
Finches, and several pairs of Mannikins. Already outside are six pairs
of Black-cheek Lovebirds, a pair of Pekin Robins, and the Silver
Pheasants. The Black-cheeks have taken the place of Budgerigars
as " seed providers ", and have bred regularly and profitably for the
last seven seasons, rearing in all nearly one hundred youngsters.
The Pekin Robins, though a true pair, have never nested in the six
years they have been in the same outdoor aviary ; they may possibly
have laid and eaten the eggs. Failures and disappointments are the lot
of every aviculturist, but the few successes more than compensate as
Captain Barclay will find out if he perseveres, as I hope he will. By
the way, my old Turtle Dove is still going strong at the age of 29 !

I have the pleasure of knowing Miss Chawner and I know that she
has a soft place in her heart for fancy Pheasants. So I am hoping she
will be able to find space in the Avicultural Magazine for the article
on " Ornamental Pheasants ". It is very gratifying to see the increased
interest that is being taken in fancy Pheasants. I have often wondered
why more people do not keep these lovely birds. I have kept them for

many years, and the longer I have them the keener I become. I have
tried through articles in the Avicultural Magazine and other papers
to get people interested and perhaps I have succeeded in a small way.
But it was not until my friend Mr. Lambert came to the front that
things got really going. He is to be congratulated on the zeal and keen-
ness he has shown. We often see each other and talk about the Pheasant
world in general. It is thanks to Mr. Lambert that the O.P.S. was
inaugurated and is proving such a success and a boon to those who
have Pheasants for sale. Miss Grant-Ives is proving herself such an
efficient and workmanlike secretary that members are rolling in every
week. There is no doubt whatever that this Society has been the means
of stimulating people's interest in this fascinating hobby. I am
delighted to see M. Delacour's name as a member. I have the pleasure
of knowing this very keen aviculturist and have paid two or three
visits to his aviaries at Cleres. I have bought many Pheasants from
him, mostly the rare varieties. He has a truly wonderful collection.
I understand M. Delacour has invited the members of the O.P.S.
to visit his aviaries in August. Go, and you will not regret it. You
will see many other tropical birds besides Pheasants, and you may see
some monkeys, and Parrots flying about his park. Just a few words
about the O.P.S. Mr. Lambert and I have had several talks on this
subject from time to time and our main purpose in starting this society
is to encourage more and more people in the keeping of fancy Pheasants.
That object is certainly being attained already. Mr. Lambert tells me
that the demand and interest in these birds is rising rapidly. It has
been, moreover, for the last two years, because the more people who
see these lovely birds the more they wish to obtain possession of them.
But that is not our only object in forming this Society. We want to
try to save from total extinction some of the rarer varieties, by
importing and breeding them in Europe. As M. Delacour remarks,
there is real danger that this will take place very shortly if something
is not done at once. As it is he tells me that that beautiful Pheasant,
the Mongolian, is nearly extinct. Some of you will gape and discredit
this statement, because you may see from time to time advertisements
in The Field , " Pure Mongolians " for sale. They were, no doubt, pure
some years ago, but other blood has crept in since then ! We must

get going and import these birds before it is too late. I am glad that
Miss Grant-Ives mentioned this in her weekly notes in Cage Birds.
I lay much stress on this point. By the way, talking of Cage Birds,
I am delighted to see so many Pheasants advertised for sale in this
weekly paper. I hope before another year or two we shall see several
of the rare varieties changing hands through the medium of this most
useful paper. Another advantage we Pheasant lovers hope to gain,
and that is that we shall be able to correspond with each other and
exchange birds and thereby get fresh blood into our aviaries. With
many of the rarer varieties this is most essential. So much in-breeding
means sickly chicks, weak constitutions, and malformed feet. I could
quote numerous instances of this. I will just mention one. M. Delacour
was the first and only importer of the very rare Imperial Pheasant,
with the result that this Pheasant is terribly in-bred by now. This also
applies in a lesser degree to the Edward's and the Elliot. All these birds,
I believe, were first brought into this country by M. Delacour. We,
indeed, owe a debt of gratitude to this gentleman. I am glad to say
that Mr. Lambert has been able to import some Elliots from America
this winter, which arrived here in good condition. These birds, of
course, will be unrelated to those in this country. I have taken
advantage of this importation and purchased a pair. I am very fond
of this Pheasant. He is a hardy fellow, very beautiful, easy to rear,
and easy to sell. I gave #25 for my first pair, you can now buy a pair
for #10. They have an added attraction in that they attain full
plumage the first year. I recommend this species to a beginner.
Talking of importing Pheasants, I have at this moment well over
#100 worth of Pheasants on their way to this country from India,
from where so many of our most beautiful Pheasants come. The
Satyr Tragopan, which takes pride of place in my estimation, hails
from India. He is a gem and will eat from your hand a month or less
after arriving in this country. The Monaul or Impeyan, the Cheer,
and the Koklas all come from the same part of the world. My consign-
ment consists of all these species, but mostly Tragopans.
It is unfortunately, with few exceptions, the only means of pro-
curing these lovely birds. There are few in this country and they are
not good breeders. If anyone wants to do a really good turn to the

O.P.S. I suggest lie imports some Lady Amhersts from their native
China. They are badly wanted over here. It is pitiable to see the
number of so-called pure Amhersts which are being sold in this country.
Ninety per cent are not pure. It is a pity that the male bird of this
graceful Pheasant becomes so vicious in the breeding season and often
ends in cold-blooded murder. But no collection is complete without
this bird. If proper care is taken during the breeding time casualties
will be considerably lessened.
The breeding season will soon be with us. By the time these notes
are in print we shall be gathering eggs from the Elliot and Peacock
Pheasants, the first to lay. The Peacock Pheasant is a truly delightful
little bird, very hardy, most graceful, and very tractable. But beware,
my friends. Do not give him more than one hen and do not put other
Pheasants with him at other times of the year. If you do, you have
signed their death warrant. I do not recommend Firebacks to
beginners. I see Mr. Lambert gives this same advice in Cage Birds.
I hope the Editor will not think I have taken up too much of her
valuable space.
I w*ill finish up by wishing all my fellow fanciers the best of luck
for 1936. I hope if any members of the O.P.S. happen to be up this
way that they will come and visit my collection, which I believe is the
best in this country.

February, when, unfortunately, it was crowded out. Unless this fact
is borne in mind some of his remarks will seem inappropriate to the
present season.-- Ed.]

affords an attraction for all men. This choir consists of hundreds of
songbirds, which live round about the High Altar in their cages. It is
a miracle of human energy which the choirmistress, Mrs. Alma Lloyd,,
has achieved in training 400 songbirds as choristers. She has her
feathered choir well in hand. She needs only to sing a few preliminary
bars. Then she gives the signal and they always make an excellent
entry. While Mrs. Alma Lloyd directs with her hands the feathered
choristers twitter their song through the light-filled chapel to the praise
of the Highest.
" The bird-choir of Sacramento is widely known. Foreigners coming
to the country do not miss the opportunity of admiring Mrs. Lloyd
and her feathered pets. ' It was a devil of a job (Heidenarbeit!) to get
my feathered friends so far, 5 the choirmistress explained, ' and many
a time I have had my doubts and wanted to give up the attempt--
but success repays all the trouble.

devotions become such a special experience for them, for the old hymns
(church songs) rendered by the birds work on the faithful like a hymn
of the creature in honour of the Creator. 5

world to travel with her little singers. ' We want to serve God and not

Rheas are not suitable for small gardens, but I do not know of
better large birds to keep in the country, either in parks or in ordinary
grass fields. Their size protects them from the attacks of ordinary-
sized dogs and foxes, and any sheep fence will keep them in. They
are absolutely hardy, requiring no shelters whatever other than some
trees, bushes, or hedges. For food, grass has only to be supplemented
with either bran, cooked potatoes, cut-up mangolds, or broken dog
biscuit; in fact, most sorts of foodstuff utilized for cattle suit them.

With the exception of a few cocks during the breeding season, they are
completely harmless as well to people as to animals, other birds,
and even eggs. Rheas are very ornamental and look both amusing
and fine as they walk and graze ; they run very fast, often with spread
wings, in an extraordinary zigzaging way. They prove quite useful
in a pasture, as they destroy most of the weeds, particularly dandelion
and plantain, and they decidedly improve the ground. They can quite
safely be associated with sheep, cattle, or deer. Rheas' feathers are
valuable ; their flesh is very good eating and their eggs about the
the size of twelve hen's eggs, are also excellent. However, these fine
birds have one drawback ; they are rather messy and it is better not
to keep them on lawns and too near houses and well kept paths ; also,
in a garden they would eat leaves and flowers. But in a park or a
meadow they look their best and behave perfectly, never interfering
with domestic or wild animals.
Rheas are natives of South America, from Brazil to Peru, and
Patagonia, and are still numerous in the wild state in several parts.
Being much smaller than their nearest relatives, the ostriches, they
also look far better, having none of the ungainly pecularities of these
giant African birds ; their neck and thighs are well covered with short
feathers ; they have no tail, but their wings, although weakly built,
are large, their long soft feathers covering the whole of the body ; they
have three toes all set forwards.
In their native haunts, Rheas live in open plains, plateaux, or
valleys, and they graze like sheep. They are typical birds of the pampa.
When the breeding season comes near, cock Rheas roar in a curious
subdued and ventriloquial way, and they can be heard far away.
They puff out the feathers of their head and neck, spread those of
their wings, which they open and drop, strutting round the hens in
a beautiful display just as striking as that of an angry mute Swan.
Females are quite dumb and show only their feelings in coming towards
the males and keeping close to them, sometimes two or three at a time,
shaking nervously and their wings kept closely pressed to their backs.
Although it may occasionally prove beneficial, it is not necessary
to keep Rheas in pairs, and many of both sexes can live and breed
successfully together, half an acre to an acre of ground, according to

the quality of the grass, being sufficient for one bird with the addition
of some other food whenever necessary. They squat on the ground at
night, their necks pressed in their backs, often settling down at the foot
of a tree on the opposite side to the wind, if it is strong. In the spring,
fights take place amongst cocks, but they are always harmless and
never last long, a hierarchy between the stronger and weaker birds
being soon established. Rheas do not pair up, the females being often
fertilized in turn by different males. The master cock of the flock
usually makes the first nest: a deep scrape in the ground where he
gathers a few twigs and feathers together. Several hens come and lay
near the nest, in which the cock soon starts sitting, squatting very low.
He brings the eggs into the nest, sometimes from fairly long distances.
When he has gathered a sufficient number, usually from ten to fifteen,
another male starts sitting and attracts the laying hens, and so on
till they have finished laying and there are no more males available.
Owing to various causes, the number of eggs in one nest may sometimes
be very large, and I have known of a cock to sit on more than thirty,
a fair proportion of which duly hatched out.
Common Rheas' eggs are rather elongated in shape and, when
freshly laid, of a greenish yellow' colour, changing into creamy white
later on. The cocks alone perform the whole duty of incubation,
getting up every day once or twice to feed and drink, the hens taking
no interest in the nest after they have laid their eggs, which take from
forty-two to forty-five days to hatch ; the nesting season in Europe
lasts from April till August.
Darwin's Rheas' eggs are slightly smaller and much brighter,
their colour being a deep yellowish green ; their incubation period
is from forty-four to forty-six days and they are laid very early in our
climate, often at the beginning of March.
Difficulties may arise during the incubation ; sometimes a cock
is disturbed by another one who wants to sit with and close to him and
robs him of his eggs, wdiich, as a result, are often broken in the process.
At other times, hens or young non-breeding birds will peck and smash
eggs while the cock is away feeding. The best way to avoid such troubles
is to build up a temporary fence of wire netting round the nest, long
enough to provide the sitting bird wfith a sufficient run to w r alk a little

and feed. It has also the advantage of preventing the newly-hatched
chicks from straying and coming to grief, as they are liable to be
killed by females or get lost and chilled. As the eggs are laid at several
days' intervals, all those in the same nest do not begin incubating at
the same time, and the young ones may be hatched on different days.
It is better to remove the first hatched chicks, as the cock is apt to
leave the nest with a few, leaving the other eggs, which are thus soon
spoilt.
Rheas' eggs can be hatched in an incubator, which has to be kept
very moist and 6* to 8* lower in temperature than for domestic fowls'
eggs. Cock Rheas will rear their own chicks, but it is often difficult
in that case to provide them with suitable food and shelter, and they
are inclined to walk them to death ; also accidents are frequent.
I find it much safer to take the young ones as soon as they are hatched
and to put them into a small movable house provided with a coal
stove as used for young chickens. Besides the necessary heat, young
Rheas are thus kept in safety out of dampness on a wooden floor
covered with straw. They are fed on cut-up green food such as dandelion,
lucerne, clover and spinach, lettuce or any other soft salad being avoided,
to which biscuit meal and bran are added, as well as some phosphate
of lime. The first day or two they may not know well how 7 to feed
and must often be offered food from the hand. They soon learn to
pick it up by themselves. If birds a few days or w r eeks older are available,
it is often convenient to put one or two among newly born chicks,
as they will teach them readily how* to eat.
The heated hut is placed in a field so that a small run with very
good short grass and clover can be arranged round it for the young
Rheas to be let loose in after four or five days when the weather permits.
After three weeks they can remain outside all day in all sorts of weather,
as they take shelter in the hut whenever wanted. The artificial
heat can be stopped after one month or six weeks, according to the
weather and season, and w r hen four months old they can sleep outside
and be let out in a large field. They grow fast and although they only
become adult in their second year, they almost reach full size w&apos;hen
a year old.
There are two different species of Rheas : the Common Rhea

[Rhea americana ) and Darwin's Rhea [Rhea pennata). Some ornotho-
logists have considered the latter as belonging to a special genus
(.Pterocnemia) which, to my mind, has no sound foundation, as differences
between the two birds, if well marked, are neither great nor important
enough. In both species, cocks and hens are alike in plumage and
shape, the males usually looking larger and coarser. The only safe
way to tell the sexes apart is to watch their attitudes in the breeding
season, when it is easy to differentiate between them while they are
calling and displaying.
Common Rheas are found from the north of Brazil to the Rio Negro
River in the Argentine. Three distinct geographical races or sub-
species occur : R. a. americana in the north of the range, a dark and
brownish bird, seldom imported and not quite hardy in Western Europe ;
R. a. intermedia, from S. Brazil and Uruguay, rather smaller, ashy-
grey with a whitish buff neck and a grey interscapular patch, also
very seldom brought over ; the third form, from the Argentine (R. a.
albescens) is the Rhea commonly seen and well acclimatized in Europe.
Of a large size, it is ashy-grey, with most of the neck and a large patch
on the chest black.
The White Rhea is only a selected albinistic variety of the above
Argentine race. It is a very fine bird, snow white, with black markings
on the neck and chest, often rather less apparent than in the grey form,,
yellow legs and bill, and pale blue eyes. It is just as strong and hardy
as the Grey Rhea, and much more ornamental. In a field, at some
distance, it shows up very much better against a green background.
Grey Rhea chicks in down are browmish buff marked with dark
brown stripes ; they very soon grow feathers and then look exactly like
miniature adults. White Rhea chicks are white, often with a few
brown patches, which soon disappear. If Grey and White Rheas are
crossed the result is as a rule grey or white birds ; only twice or three
times have I seen intermediate birds, buff or cream-coloured, looking
rather ugly and untidy. Parti-coloured birds do not seem to exist.
Darwen's Rheas (R. pennata) live south and west of the Common
Rhea, from the highlands of S. Peru and Bolivia, N.W. and S. Argentina
to Patagonia. Three races occur, according to Chubb : R. p. garleppi
in the north of the range, R. p. tarapacensis in N. Chili, and R. p ,

pennata in the south. Only the east lowland form has been imported
at rare intervals. The two highland races are said to be browner above
and to have a smaller number of scutes (eight to ten instead of sixteen
to eighteen) on the lower portion of the tarsus, R. p. tarapacensis
being rufous-brown with grey head and neck, while these parts are
isabelline buff in R. p. garleppi, whose lower neck is dusky brown and
upper surface greyish brown. Typical Darwin's Rheas are brownish
grey, all the feathers of the upper parts showing a broad terminal white
patch. Their plumage is quite bright after the moult, but it gradually
becomes greyer and duller, the white tips more or less wearing out.
The under parts are paler browmish-grey ; no black markings on the
neck or chest. But there are important differences between this species
and the Common Rhea : although the body is of about the same bulk,
Darwin's Rhea has decidedly shorter neck, legs, and bill ; its propor-
tions are not nearly so elongated and angular, and consequently it
looks much better. The enclosed photographs show quite obviously
what a much prettier bird it is. Another of its peculiarities is that the
tarsus is half covered with short feathers in front. As they live in a
colder and damper climate, one might expect Darwin's Rheas to
prove very strong and robust in Europe. This would be a great mistake.
They are of course perfectly hardy in winter, but they suffer in the
hot summer days. Furthermore, though they require the same food
as the Common species, they are much more delicate, coarse grass
will soon kill them. On the rich soft grass of Normandy and in many
parts of England they do well, especially if the field is well grazed
down by animals or cut down short. But in other districts one must
keep them on bare ground, all grass being destroyed. It is only in this
way that the late F. S. Blaauw was able to keep and breed them in
Holland. Besides our lamented Dutch member, the Duke of Bedford,
Lord Rothschild, and myself have been, as far as I know, the only
amateurs who have tried Darwin's Rheas, with very limited success.
At Woburn they have been bred once or twice, but losses have been
heavy. At Cleres, they have lived well when once acclimitized, and young
have been hatched twice, two living for several months and dying of
accidents. Owing to unlucky circumstances, we had no chance of
breeding them during the last few years, as we had only males left.

Common Rhea females put to them were murdered. A new consign-
ment of six young birds arrived early last year from Patagonia. They
have now become adult and are in fine condition, living in a 50-acre
enclosure in company with a herd of the pretty Pseudaxis Deer from
Toukin, Manchurian Cranes, Peafowl, and different species of Geese
and Sheldrakes. We may hope that, this time, they will become
established. At Tring, Lord Rothschild bred some hybrids twenty
years ago between the two species of Rheas ; they looked just inter-
mediate between the parents and, as far as I know, proved to be fertile.
Darwin's Rhea chicks are beautiful, far better in shape and colour
than those of the Common Rhea ; their bill is much shorter, as well as
their legs, the body is rounder, the down finer and softer, very pale
grey with almost black markings.
Although Darwin's Rheas are reported to be so common in their
native land as to prove a pest on whose heads a premium for destruction
is paid, they are very seldom sent over to Europe, as they live far away
inland from any suitable port, and they have remained very rare
and expensive here to this day. Their acclimatization is most desirable
as it would add a very interesting and highly ornamental bird to our
parks.

has been hand rearing Swallows, taming them so that he can let them
fly out at complete liberty and they come back and settle on his hand

the same way a hen Swallow during the winter 1934-5. In the following
spring the pair of Swallows built a nest of mud (which their master
provided for them) against the wall of an aviary 25 feet by 12 feet by
6 feet, using a small wooden platform intended for the Eock Martin
to roost on at night. Five young were hatched, the first two died
because their birth was not noticed and no proper food was supplied ;
the next three were very easily reared by the parents on ants' eggs.
In the autumn the three young birds and the mother were let out, the
male and the female Eock Martin being kept in the aviary as M. Plocq
is trying this year to breed hybrids between the two species.

By Miss J. M. Grant-Ives
Many members of the O.P.S. have urged the Committee to publish
a booklet or journal, and so the Committee have acquiesced. The first
publication will take place about the middle of May. This will be the
first Pheasant journal ever issued, at least we think so, so a few words
as to the contents will not be out of place. The main features will be
articles by world famous aviculturists such as J. Delacour, J. Stefani,
P. Schmidt, Leland Smith, E. G. Bradshaw, Y. Malisoux, and
Scotland, Wales, and Ireland will also be represented ; and last, but
not least, your worthy Editor, Miss E. Chawner. One of the oldest
fanciers in Great Britain will also contribute as well as the youngest.
A short fairy tale, which will deal with Pheasants in their native habitat,
will be included. There will be other topical articles, and the journal
will be liberally supplied with short pithy hints on rearing Pheasants
and on matters relating to the O.P.S., and finally a full list of our
members and their addresses.
Our frontispiece will be ambitious and costly. It is a reproduction of
a magnificent painting of an Amherst cock, painted by one of our
members, Miss Cooper. It depicts an adult cock standing on a bough
overlooking clear water. The cock, observing its reflection in the

showing every feature of this fine appendage. I have mentioned the
contents at length for one specific purpose.
Many members of your Society are naturally interested in all birds
but have not joined the O.P.S. Now I shall be most pleased to forward
a copy of this journal to any members of the Avicultural Society who
sends me a post-card with their full address. This will be absolutely
free and post paid. It will be obvious that we have an ulterior motive
in doing this. We hope that if this journal is perused many will be
pleased with it and consider that the O.P.S. is deserving of their active
support.
I do hope that many members will avail themselves of this offer and
that this effort to popularize still more our Society will have happy
results. We are working very hard to achieve success, and we only
want your support to ensure it.
Of course, all Members of the O.P.S. will receive a copy of the journal.

The Birds of the Firth of Clyde. By J. M. Me William. Published
by H. F. and G. Witherby, 326 High Holborn, London, W.C. 1.
12s. 6 d. net.
This book deals with the bird-life of the Firth of Clyde and includes
all of Ayrshire, Benfrewshire, Buteshire, Dumbartonshire, and the
southern part of Argyllshire. The author says in the introduction that
he assumes " that those who work with this will have read The Birds
of the Island of Bute and The Birds of Ayrshire ", and does not repeat
in this present volume the information he gave previously. He also
refers the reader to Birds of the Island of Bute for dates of arrival of
migrants.
From an ornithological point of view the Clyde district is divided
into two main areas, north and south of the Firth of Clyde, and in some
cases birds are rare in one area and common in the other. It is obviously
of great interest to the ornithologist as it is only comparatively recently

Parrots, Parakeets, and Budgerigars. By Rosslyn Mannering.
Pet and Livestock Series. Cassell and Co., Ltd., La Belle Sauvage,
London, E.C. Is. 6^. net.
This is another of the excellent little handbooks brought out by
Messrs. Cassell and Co., which have done so much to promote
the comfort and health of pets kept by the unlearned. It should be
studied by everyone who keeps or proposes to keep a Parrot, as it
deals with their feeding, housing, breeding, and treatment in health
and disease. Movable aviaries are advocated, plans shown, and no
trouble is spared to instruct the amateur how to erect them and to
arrange for heat, where necessary, and above all for the exclusion of rats
and mice.
Valuable advice is given on hand-rearing birds from the nest and
on breeding Budgerigars for colour variations. Even descriptions of
species and sexual distinctions are given&apos; a chapter, and on the last page
a series of " Don'ts for Parrot-keepers " deserves the gratitude of birds
and bird-keepers alike.

St. Paul's Cathedral. The area is divided into twelve parts, and the
birds to be found in each are described.
A valuable feature of the book is a practical indexed transport guide
as to the means of getting to each place described or mentioned as
worthy of a visit, assisted by the Ordnance map called Greater London,
price 3s., and equipped with a good pair of binoculars.
I can imagine few pleasanter ways of spending a fine day and,
needless to say, Mr. Lockley is a highly efficient guide and discourses
most ably on the birds and beasts which may be seen with average luck
and eyesight. I would, however, remind him that " Barred
Woodpecker " is the accepted name of another species and cannot be
adopted for the Lesser Spotted, however appropriate it appears. Only
the cocks of both Pied and Lesser Spotted have red crowns (p. 11),
even as nestlings the hens have leaden ones.
A pair of Swifts breed every year in a hole in the thatch of my
garden wall, and I have many times seen a bird detach itself from the
throng dashing and screaming high up in the sky and slip noiselessly
into the hole just before nightfall. I have been told by boys hunting
the thatch after dark for Sparrows that sometimes they put their hands
into a Swift's hole and get well bitten, they say by two birds, which may
or may not be the case. As Mr. Lockley says on p. 106, the problem
has not yet been solved.
The black and white illustrations are excellent and show the
distinguishing marks of the species under discussion most unmistakably.
Altogether an admirable book.

RARE-FEATHERED GREENFINCHES
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.997397238095238" page_id="56289635"  page_num="145" year="" vol="">
Sir,--I am sending you a Greenfinch, and shall be very much obliged
for a report on the cause of death.
I do not know if you saw a note a year or so ago in the Avicultural
Magazine by Dr. Hopkinson, in which he stated that he was very sceptical
as to Greenfinches having been bred in captivity beyond the first generation.
He said in his experience his birds hatched and reared successfully but that
the young ones all died either in the following winter or the succeeding spring.
He asked for some authentic information from fellow members on the subject.
I intended to write, but put it off, and did not do so. Moreover I expected
someone else with longer experience of Greenfinches would probably do so.
The matter is of great interest to me because I have been, as you know,
breeding Greenfinches in several new colours from sports. I find it is perfectly
true that they are difficult to deal with, though I have by dint of taking pains
achieved a good measure of success, and have not lost more than about
30 per cent of young ones through disease. To this has to be added the
inevitable losses by accident, especially through owls, hawks, and so forth,
which attack aviaries situated in the country.
I have been unlucky in losing most of the specimens showing the new
colours. Naturally I am very keen to eliminate losses through disease. With
my other British birds, Blackbirds, Thrushes, Sparrows, Chaffinches, Bullfinches
etc., my losses from disease are almost nil, as the birds are kept under natural
conditions in very large aviaries. The question of the Greenfinch is, however
a very important one to me. Mr. A. K. Gill, one of the Cage Birds experts,
thinks that Greenfinches are peculiarly liable to bacteriological infection,
but I do not think this explains the matter, as in some of my aviaries the
population is so low that any danger from this source is practically eliminated.
Death in most cases has supervened after gradual wasting. The Greenfinch
which I sent you a year or two ago was stated to be full of tubercle. I dare
say you will find the same applies to the bird I am sending you now, but if
the bird dies of tuberculosis it points to a deficiency in the diet, yet I supply
them with large quantities of natural food, such a&apos;s chickweed, flowering
grasses, sprouted seeds, besides bread and milk and so forth. I find most
British finches are fairly carnivorous and they do very well on being supplied
with mealworms, maggots, and so forth. Curiously enough one Bullfinch
hen brought up her young ones on earth worms, which seems very strange.
I am always pleased when I see my birds taking animal foods. My Green-
finches, as far as I have been able to observe, are, however, strict vegetarians.
The Ministry of Agriculture has analysed the crop contents of a great many
birds to find whether they are useful or harmful, but their pamphlet on
Greenfinches does not throw much light on the subject. I wish I could find
out exactly what is the diet of the Greenfinch in its wild'state.

THE RECENT IMPORTATION OF BLUE LORIKEETS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99582824" page_id="56289636"  page_num="146" year="" vol="">
Madam, --It is with the greatest pleasure that I looked at the delightful
and very accurate painting, by Roland Green, of the Tahitian White-throated
Lory (Coriphilus peruvianus) published as a frontispiece to the March issue of
the Aviculture Magazine. I read also with interest the notes, written by
my esteemed friend Monsieur J. Delacour, to accompany that fine plate.
However one sentence in that short article seems to need a few words of
comment. After relating the recent arrival in Europe of several pairs of
these exceedingly rare Lories, Monsieur Delacour says that this " is somewhat
surprising, as they are supposed to be strictly protected throughout the
French South Sea possessions. But it seems almost impossible to enforce
regulations on such remote and scattered islands ".
Such statement ps apt to convey the idea that these birds were smuggled
out of the French Etablissements de 1'Oceanie in spite of the protective laws.
From a private letter written to me by another aviculturist, I get that
" il est douloureux pour des Francais de voir menacees par 1'amour du lucre . . .
des especes que la loi protege, avec raison ! " This proves that some French
fanciers think that the importation of those birds has been undertaken as a
commercial proposition, in order to make some financial profit.
Being personally responsible for the importation of nearly half the con-
signment of Blue Lorikeets to Europe, I think that I ought to make clear to
the mind of your readers that our French friends have been in both cases
badly informed about the circumstances of such importation. First of all the
said birds were obtained from Tahiti through a quite regular and special licence
by the Governor of that French possession ; they went also through special
examination by the Government Veterinary at Papete, Society Islands.
The exportation permit has been granted on account of the scientific object
of the experiment purposely to somebody who has done probably more than
anyone else to restore the much persecuted avifauna of Tahiti and to obtain
the passing of regulations for the protection of birds in these islands. As usual,
some people will complain that the licence was granted to foreigners, rather
than to French citizens, but it would be fair to state that since then a number
of French residents in Tahiti tried to keep specimens of Blue Lories alive in
captivity, many birds being wasted in that way solely by lack of proper
treatment. Let us understand that the danger of extermination of those
lovely Parakeets does not come from a few pairs being exported under the
very best conditions to two or three reliable aviculturists, but from the foolish
introduction in their native haunts of rats, mongooses, mynahs, and other
vermin. It is perhaps half a century since the Blue Lorikeet was living in the
island of Tahiti proper, and I really think that it is for the benefit of ornithology
that their behaviour in captivity can be studied before it is too late.
The astonishing amount of trouble and expenditure involved in keeping
a few pairs of these birds in aviaries in their own country, in discovering their
proper management in captivity, in shipping them with the greatest care, and
in conveying that precious consignment to Europe, makes it highly doubtful
in any case as a commercial undertaking, and nobody involved in this experi-
ment will ever get the slightest financial profit from it. At the present time,
most of the birds are in the hands of two aviculturists, one in England, the
other in Belgium, who will keep them under the best possible conditions
and spare nothing to induce them to breed in captivity.

Preservation, I think I realize just as well as anybody else the value of rare
birds, and chiefly of insular species threatened with extinction ; but at the
same time I do consider that the highest goal of technical aviculture is
precisely to try to save such species from extermination by establishing good
breeding stocks of them. Such a scheme should be encouraged rather than
criticized.
I take this opportunity of drawing your attention to a quite accessory
mistake in the above-mentioned notes by Monsieur Delacour. The Ultramarine
Lory ( C . smaragdinus, termed by him C. ultramarinus), from the Marquesas
Islands, has not a black bill, but a light coral-red one, just like the Tahitian
species ; however, in both kinds, the bill is blackish in very young individuals,
but when the birds are four or six months old, bill and feet alike become
yellowish, and then bright red ; the colour of the bill fades quickly to amber
yellow, not only in dead specimens skinned for museum purposes, but even
in any sick bird.
Representing the Ultramarine Lory with black bill and feet, when adult,
was a mistake made by Mivart in 1898 when he published his wonderfully
illustrated monograph on " The Loridae ".
May I add that a pair of my Tahitian Lories has been exhibited--for the
first time and with great success--at the Brussels Annual Bird Show on
8th to 10th February, 1936 ; they were the very first to reach Continental
Europe alive since the discovery of the species in Buff on's time.

SOME SUGGESTIONS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.951012166666667" page_id="56289637"  page_num="147" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- When in London for the B.O.U. March meeting I had a talk
with a few of our members about the Magazine and, as one of the older
members of the Society, I take the liberty of making a few suggestions.
(1) Why is it that the dealers' advertisements have been done away with ?
They were a most useful part of our valuable Journal for two reasons (a) they
gave a list each month of the birds offering in London or elsewhere: surely
aviculturists cannot get on without such firms to supply their aviaries with
even the commoner, but altogether delightful, small birds. Surely these
omissions are not in deference to the rather acrimonious correspondence
which occurred in the Magazine of late ! The explorer-dealer is of little use
to the ordinary aviculturist as he does not publish lists and what he does
bring home is usually beyond the pocket of most of us. I do think members
would welcome the dealers' lists again ; ( b) they are of great interest to look
back at: one binds them with the Magazine and they are a record of prices
ruling in any given year.
(2) In the old days we used to have tremendously interesting and instructive
correspondence in the form of questions and answers. Looking through the
earlier volumes one finds an enormous number of valuable hints on all manner
of subjects appertaining to our hobby. Furthermore, we used to have quite a
lot of information about the causes of illness and death from, I think, Mr. Gill.
These notes were useful and helpful. Surely there must still be a considerable
amount of the question and answer correspondence amongst active members
which, if it found its way to the correspondence pages, would be of inestimable
value to us all.

because those who like myself bind in all covers and advertisements, which is
the proper way to do, will find the volume getting rather bulky and, owing to
the thick covers, difficult to run through when looking for any particular

Madam, --Mr. Chaplin must have misread my letter: I did not say that I
had no use for Ornithology as a science, but merely that to make our Journal
more scientific than it is at present would not in my opinion have the effect
of increasing its popularity. Surely to encourage the keeping and breeding of
many species of birds in confinement and getting the man in the street
interested in this is a sufficient object. I feel most strongly, that this is far
more interesting to the average person than a magazine which generally
refers to species by their Latin names, and in which plumage descriptions,
for example, would be largely unintelligible to many people : we have other
journals of this type and I for one would seriously consider whether the
Aviculture Magazine was serving any useful purpose were it to alter in the
way your correspondent means. With regard to his remarks anent Mr. Webb,
I am, however, in complete agreement, but may I point out that the latter's
humane and public spirited action will be fruitless unless we as members do
something. I again from my own experience state that it appears to be nothing
short of blatant cruelty to encourage the importation of many fresh caught
birds from May to September. To take only one very common example, is it
not the experience of pretty well everybody that African Firefinches die like
flies if purchased in these months ? The waste of money being only the least
of the matter. From experience borne out more strongly than ever by some
recently purchased and gloriously fit specimens of this little bird--the only
way to get healthy ones is to buy in the early spring, when apparently over-
heated cages and water fouled by the birds and then sun warmed, etc., are not
nearly so prevalent in the dealers' shops--it is naturally a fact that disease
germs multiply greatly in the summer months. I do not think I have ever
been able to keep alive a Firefinch purchased in the summer for more than a
week or two and other Waxbills have been little better. I have decided to
refrain from doing so in future and trust others will follow my example. Then
as suggested last year for goodness sake let us have a series of licensed and
controlled bird shops if possible and it should be. Difficult perhaps.
Finally one other matter needs adjustment if we are really to encourage
the breeding of many birds in captivity I suggest that some of us will have to
bring down our prices. I suggest that to charge #14 to #20 per pair for such
birds as Rosellas and Pennants (unless prize winners) which can be purchased
for a few shillings, I am told, in their native land is not serving the best
interests of aviculture. We want more and more of these birds to be bred.
Then why debar all but a few people from doing so ? There must be many

JAMIESON'S FIREFINCR
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.999211095238095" page_id="56289639"  page_num="149" year="" vol="">
Mr. F. Johnson's article in the Avicultural Magazine prompts me to
relate my own experience of the beautiful Jamieson's Firefinch, even though
my own ended much less successfully.
In the middle of last summer I purchased from Messrs. De Von &amp; Co.
a very beautiful pair of Jamieson's Firefinches, brought them straight home,
and liberated them at once in an aviary occupied by nearly a score of common
African Firefinches, Cordon Bleus, and other small Waxbills. The aviary is
one-third section of a multiple wooden structure, having a flight of 14 feet
in length with a shelter shed 7 feet long. Both shed and flight are 4 feet in
width. The floor throughout is of wood, so that there is no possibility of having
growing shrubs of any size. As a substitute a large bundle of green branches
and twigs was placed in the shelter and branches of yew both in the shed and
in the flight. Nest-boxes of many types, coco-nut husks, and other types of
nesting receptacle occupied the corners of the shed, and every other
convenient place.
I found the Jamieson's Firefinches very shy, inclined to hide amongst the
branches, or if searched for, to fly close to the ground until they reached a
place as far as possible from the intruder when they perched on the highest
available twig. The cock has a most delightful little trilling song, and few
birds can look more attractive than a cock Jamieson's sitting on a lofty twig
in bright sunshine, chest out, and throat pulsating, trifling his sweet song and
looking like a glistening ball of fiery red. Despite their gorgeous red colour
they can make themselves really inconspicuous, especially the hen, although
she is only little less red than the cock.
During the succeeding weeks I was astonished at the number of cock
common Firefinches which I found dead, most of them with skull injuries.
Every two or three mornings I would find one or occasionally two, and almost
always in the shed. Reluctant to blame the Jamieson's, I was inclined to put
it down to fighting, or to connect it with the unreasonable hatred and jealousy
of the cock of a pair of Virginian Cardinals occupying the adjoining flight.
After losing some half-dozen or more--all cocks--I decided to catch up the
few remaining ones and transfer them elsewhere. I was aware that various
nests had been built and were occupied, and was particularly interested in a
roughly built flat nest built on a small branch of yew and shielded from view
by overhanging greenery. The hen Jamieson's had been repeatedly startled
out of the vicinity of this nest, but as she invariably dropped to the floor
before flying out it was difficult to determine exactly where she came from.
It had latterly become obvious that she was more and more reluctant to take
flight, and finally I saw her actually sitting on this nest. My hopes ran high,
although I refrained from investigating further.
One sunny day in mid-September, shortly afterwards, I caught up all
the common Firefinches that could be found, and transferred them to an

adjoining aviary. To my horror, on releasing them, I realized that the cock
Jamieson's had also been caught and transferred with the other common
African varieties. The Jamieson's is only slightly larger, and in flight is
distinguished chiefly by the longer and wider tail, by the blackness of the tail,
and by the generalized bright red colour of the body. It is quite easy to make
a mistake ; but you may be sure that it was not many minutes before this
one was caught up again and returned to his old quarters. Anxiously I waited
and watched. What would happen ? Alas ! But one short half-hour later,
on looking into the aviary, there on the ground lay five small white eggs,
broken, incubation being well advanced in each--probably only a few days
off hatching. The nest was being pulled to pieces and destroyed by the cock
bird as though it were his one object in life. The eggs were small, though
decidedly larger than the ordinary Firefinches', extremely fragile in
appearance, pure white, and rather pointed at one end. The nest was rather
roughly built of dried grass and hair, without much of a cup, although the
eggs lay on fine down. The nest gave the appearance of most hasty
construction.
Towards the end of September a fresh nest was commenced on the same
site, but as the season was so far advanced it was not completed.
My birds apparently lived entirely on seed, canary, white millet, Indian
millet, and Niger being available. Soft food was provided, but I never once
saw either bird pay the slightest attention to it, although both were very fond
of small mealworms.
These Firefinches are most delightful and attractive little birds, and if they
really were responsible for the deaths of so many of my other smaller Fire-
finches I can forgive them, knowing how determined they were upon setting
up house for themselves, evidently determined also to take no risk of
interference from other birds whose colour suggested possible rivalry.

The Copper Pheasants of Japan are divided into two well-marked
groups : the cocks from Hondo, the main island, and the northern
parts of Shikoku, have most of their feathers bordered with white,
like the specimen depicted on the adjoining plate, while more to the
south a more uniformly red bird is found. But in certain localities of
southern Hondo and Shikoku, both forms are found, with innumerable
intermediates. The two greatest authorities on the subject, Prince
Taka-Tsukasa and Dr. N. Kuroda, differ in their opinion on these
Pheasants : the former considers that there are two species which
produce wild hybrids, while the second thinks that they all con-
stitute forms of One species, with many geographical races. We
cannot discuss this point here, and as far as aviculture is concerned, we
can be satisfied with the existence of three distinct birds, the Glittering,
Scemmerring's, and Ijima's Copper Pheasants. Copper Pheasants are
related to the other long-tailed species, and particularly to Reeves'
Pheasant ; but not so closely as it might be believed, as hybrids between
them prove infertile, thus showing that deep differences must exist.
Although hardy and laying well in captivity, Copper Pheasants remain

quite scarce in European collections. They are extremely quarrelsome
and the cock often kills his hen, while it is impossible to keep two of
the latter together for long. The chicks are not too easy to rear. Con-
sequently, these fine birds are much sought after and the demand
always exceeds the supply. The Glittering Copper Pheasant usually
is, however, more easily obtained than Scemmerring's, and Ijima's is
the rarest of all.
Copper Pheasants live in mountainous forest districts.

Though foreign Doves were, so to speak, my first love in aviculture,
I soon found that I could not read the enthusiastic descriptions of
Softbills in issue after issue of the Avicultural Magazine of some
ten or twenty years ago without becoming strongly tempted to procure
a Softbill or two. Especially attracted was I by the Softbill's ability
to sing. Never having kept an insectivorous bird in cage or aviary
before and having been told by local aviculturists that their care
necessitated an extraordinarily large amount of time and effort, I decided
to begin keeping Softbills in a modest way.
Having read more than a dozen charming accounts of the Shama
Thrush as a songster of unusual ability and quality, I soon placed
an order for one. Immediately upon arrival the bird won my admira-
tion, for though he had been en route for five days in a small box,
he emerged from it hale and hearty and, to my great surprise and
delight, broke into song the moment he entered his new abode. That
happened more than two years ago.
To-day this Shama Thrush still ranks as the most accomplished
singer among the twenty-five odd varieties of birds which I keep in
cage and aviary. Never have I known a greater mimic. Certainly
in this respect the Shama is far superior to the mocking birds which
he hears outdoors practically the whole day long. His repertoire boasts
the wailing sounds of two Cocker Spaniel puppies, the spirited crowing
of roosters, the cackling of hens, the peculiar rasping sound uttered

by a Japanese Bush-warbler, whom he heard but very few days, and
many other quaint notes. Perhaps the most delightful phase of his
song consists of whistles which are clear, oft repeated, and very joyous.
As a songster the Shama is truly indefatigable, singing literally almost
from early morning until late at night, and even by electric light.
Nor was there ever a more active or more beautiful creature. Graceful
and alert in all his movements, his plumage is as glossy and sleek as
if every single feather of it were indeed brand new.
In the British and other avicultural magazines, I have, with some
envy, read how the Shama has been bred successfully time and time
again. Though I have for the past year and a half tried my very best
to procure a female Shama, I have been unable to do so. It seems
that females are not imported into the United States, though, to be
sure, they seem quite plentiful in the European bird markets.
My second Softbill, and one to grace a very large and roomy
cage, is a Clarino, also called Townsend's Solitaire Thrush or Flycatcher.
The poor bird arrived in a very small, open wire cage from the Mexican
border, there being neither water nor feed in it. He was in deplorable
condition, with drooping head and wings--ready to die. Since he
was too weak to eat, I had to force him to take some bread dipped
in goat's milk. To my joy, he responded quickly. Within a week
he took mealworms from the hand. Before the first month of his
sojourn in Southern California was up, he sang. And such a strangely
beautiful song ! Never before had I heard the like of it. It was like
the tinkling of distant silver bells mingled with the rich, clear notes
of a clarinet--and all uttered very joyously and spiritedly. Once you
have heard the Clarino's beauteous melody, it is likely to linger in
your mind and heart like one of Nature's everlasting blessings. Need-
less to say, my Clarino is now very tame. Unlike other Clarinos I have
listened to, this particular bird's song does not end with the usual
harsh and rasping note. So fond is this bird of bathing that he flies
into his bath cabinet the very moment it is placed in his cage. He
relishes especially chopped apple mixed with hard-boiled egg and some
crushed rusk or biscuit, which mixture he prefers to mocking-bird food.
His cage is so large that he has to fly from perch to perch, thus keeping
in good health day after day.

Carl Naether--A Beginner tries Softhills
After keeping these two charming songsters for a year without
any particular difficulty, I decided to add a few other interesting
Softhills. Thus when a Japanese bird dealer offered me a Japanese
Eobin Eedbreast (Akahige) and somewhat later a Loochoo or
Temminck's Eobin ( Luscinia komadori), I took them gladly, even
though I was soon to learn that Eobins' cages require much more
frequent cleaning each single day than do those of Thrushes. Whereas
Thrushes stay largely on perches, Eobins like to explore the cage bottoms,
thus often dirtying their feet, which, unless given prompt and careful
attention, are likely to develop sores. Both Thrushes and Eobins
as well as their cages are looked after at least half a dozen times
each day.
Both these Japanese birds are good whistlers, though, of course,
their song does not compare with that of either Shama Thrush or
Clarino in length, variety, or quality. The Eobins' notes are heard
mainly in the early morning, beginning at 5.30. They are somewhat
solemn and dignified, yet spirited, and often repeated. They remind
me very much of those of the American Eobin Eedbreast as I have
listened to their song coming simultaneously from hundreds of birds
high up in the sequoia trees of the California Sierras. The Japanese
Eobin Eedbreast has become so tame that he leaves, and returns to,
his cage at will, for he loves to explore every nook and corner of the
room in which his cage happens to be and to fly on the Shama's cage
in order to tease and excite him. Like my other Softhills, the Eedbreast
is passionately fond of bathing, returning to his bath-dish time and
time again until he has splashed out almost every bit of water.
Not long ago, a local bird-dealer offered me a Japanese " Nightingale,
very rare and a very fine singer ", called Uguisu in Japan. A small,
grey bird it was, very shy and very active, which upon careful investiga-
tion proved to be the Japanese Bush-warbler (Horeites cantans Tern.).
Though having peculiar call notes, the bird was most assuredly not
a singer of the quality of a Nightingale or Thrush. Unfortunately I did
not have the Bush-warbler long enough to study his habits and his
song closely, as he died suddenly of a stroke, the same fate befalling
also those specimens kept by the dealer. It was the first loss I had
suffered among Softhills, and to this day I do not know what caused

the bird's sudden death, since he appeared to be in perfect health until
very shortly before the end.
Taken all in all, I have found the keeping of Softbills a truly
fascinating hobby. While their care entails more time and effort than
that of Hardbills, their delightful song and charming tameness have
repaid me many times for the effort I have made to provide as clean
and comfortable surroundings for these insectivorous birds as possible.
I have become so attached to my Softbills that I shall not want to

By E. W. Chaplin
My avicultural efforts have always been on so small a scale that
I have never felt that an account of them at any one time would prove
of sufficient interest to justify the space required for an article in the
Magazine. The same applies at the present time, and it is only with
the idea of putting a little hope into the faint heart of Captain E. H.
Barclay and of possible waverers who may read his very lugubrious
article that I venture to give my experiences.
I am not one of our magnate members, able to buy a bird first
and ask the price afterwards. I have very carefully to count the
cost and what I regard as a treasure they probably place amongst
the " also-rans ".
In my juvenile days I usually had a few foreigners in cages, and
being then fully convinced that their greatest need was as much heat
as possible my fears for their early deaths were seldom ill-founded.
My first open-air venture was with Golden Pheasants. I had seen
them advertised in the Exchange and Mart at modest prices, and
I made up my mind to have some. Eirst I put up an aviary for them.
This was about 18 feet long by 9 feet wide and 9 feet high. The wire
netting that I used was, I suppose, about # in. mesh, anyway, it was
small enough to keep out rats and sparrows, but not mice. I buried
wire netting all round to the depth of about 1 foot. Soon after I started

rats found their way in and I then put a new lot of wire going further
down. It is so long ago that I am not quite sure of the depth, but
I think that it was 3 ft. wire cut in half longitudinally, and buried
with the rough edge at the bottom and turned slightly upwards. That
was over forty years ago, and I do not think that I have had a rat
in an aviary since. Mice were a nuisance until I took to feeding the
birds on tables with one central leg. After a time the little sons of
Satan used to climb along the woodwork and drop on the tables from
above. A disc of tin hung by a string through its centre above the
table put a stop to this little game.
The aviary was boarded all round to the height of about 2 feet
to prevent the birds being frightened by passing dogs. About one-
third of the structure was boarded at the sides and top and the
remainder wired in a similar way. There was at first no division between
the boarded part and the flight but later I filled in with boards the
upper part (the inverted V of the roof). The lower part was left open.
Some time after I had started with the Pheasants, I put in a pair
of Cockateels, and, later, a pair of Virginian Nightingales. Both of
these lived for many years and both nested regularly. The former
reared their young but the latter always deserted theirs when about
ten days old. The Virginian Nightingales had a very attractive song,
some of their notes being so exactly like those of our own Nightingale
that visitors often came in with tales of having heard a Nightingale
at some quite impossible time of the year.
I later built a similar aviary in line with, but about three feet from,
the end of the first. In this I kept Amherst Pheasants and a pair
of Rosellas. This aviary also was open in the same way as the other.
I had the Bosellas for four or five years. One year they sat and fully
reared two fine, healthy young ones. I now think that the reason
that I did not have better results with breeding was that I only gave
them home-made wooden boxes to nest in. I used to put a little soft
touchwood in the bottoms of the boxes. Frequently, even in the
winter, they would, instead of perching, cling side by side to the wire
netting in the open run. Although sometimes I could hardly sleep
for thinking of them they never seemed any the worse for the night out.
I reared many young Pheasants of both varieties, using feather-legged

bantams as mothers. Joseph, the cock Golden, was very tame, and
liked being handled. He had the curious habit of hying straight on
to the top of my head whenever I went into the aviary.
One of his wives (he was a Mormon and had three !) also had a
curious, but less amusing, habit. She almost always laid her eggs when
sitting on a perch, thus acquiring the name of " the Absent-minded
Beggar ". Pheasant owners who have not tried it may like to know
that there was nothing at any time of the year that my birds more
appreciated than bunches of ripe elderberries hung from the roof.
These I hung a little above their easy reach in order that they should
have to jump to get at them.
Later I filled in the space between the ends of the two aviaries.
The sides were the boarded ends of the larger aviaries, the back and
the back slope of the roof were boarded and also the front slope for
about half its depth, the front being wired with fine mesh netting.
Prom the lower edge of the boarding the wiring was carried out like a
dormer window. I had a movable glass frame made to cover this
part in winter but the front was left unprotected except that in foggy
weather I hung a garden mat there. One winter was so cold that the
water had to be renewed two or three times a day.
In this aviary I kept Gouldian and Zebra Pinches, Cordon Bleus,
Pintail Whydahs, and several other varieties. Of these all the cocks
and both of the Whydahs lived for some years and were only disposed
of at the outbreak of the War.
I did not at this time realize that it was not difficult to breed some
of the little foreigners and had made very inadequate provision for such
activities on their part, though just enough to lead their thoughts in
that direction. The result was that each spring I lost most of the
hens from egg-binding. It was not the aviary but my ignorance that
was to blame for this.
Prom 1915 to 1929 I had no aviary but in the latter year I put
up one in my present garden. The end of a wooden shed forms one
side of it. It is 12 feet long, 4 feet wide, and in height slopes from
9 to 6 feet. At the higher end it is boarded to form an inner shelter
with a fairly large window. It has a door into the flight which is
left open in the summer, a small square cut out of the top corner of

the door giving access in winter when the door is kept shut. I later
added glass to the upper part of the flight to keep off driving rain.
My birds have no other protection whatever. In this I put a pair
each of green, blue, and yellow Budgerigars, and a pair of Crimson-
crested Cardinals. The Budgerigars breed only too freely but the
Cardinals, like the Virginian Nightingales, laid two or three times each
year, hatched their eggs, and deserted the young when about ten days
old. They also varied their diet by robbing the Budgerigars of eggs
and an occasional young one. For three years they were in perfect
health and condition and then I gave them away owing to their
predatory habits. I then put in a pair of Zebra Finches. Although
I have seen it stated in the Magazine that they do not do well with
Budgerigars mine did very well indeed.
One little gentleman deserves to have his actions recorded. The
first cock that I put in never looked really fit but he and his wife set
to work in a coco-nut husk and had been sitting for about a week
when he unfortunately died. As the hen was usually flying about
when I went into the aviary I concluded that she was not going to
take on the responsibility of rearing a family without help. I did her
an injustice. Two or three days after the first cock died I bought
another, recently imported. I usually prefer to keep new birds in
quarantine for a few weeks but as the poor little lady seemed lonely
I turned him in with her after four days. Within a few minutes of
his being turned out he flew straight into the husk where the others
had nested. His manner made me wonder whether there could possibly
be young in the nest and I concluded that if there were he had certainly
gone in to settle their little hashes for them. There really were young
and the hen had evidently continued sitting for about a week and for
some days at any rate had fed her family unaided. All day long
the mother and the foster-father tended the family until about half
an hour before sunset when they would allow themselves a little time
off for love-making, sitting cuddled up side by side on a branch in
the flight. One day four young and the next day one more came
out of the nest. All grew into strong, healthy birds, and the foster-
father was as assiduous in his attentions to them as any real father
could have been. All the same I think that sometimes, when the

Three years ago I duplicated this aviary and in it I have Cut-throats,
Zebras, Cordon Bleus, Gouldians, and a Rainbow Bunting. One day
last week (I am writing on 11th February) I was a little alarmed to
see the Gouldian with feathers drenched from a bath that he had just
taken in water dripping from a lump of melting ice. Up to now he
is none the worse for it. The hen Gouldian died early in the winter
but a post mortem cleared myself and the aviary from blame. The
same applies to the wife that I bought for the Rainbow Bunting when
in immature plumage. Mr. Hicks diagnosed a complaint of long
standing but, personally, I think that her death was due to the shock
of finding when she moulted that instead of being a hen Rainbow she
was a cock Nonpareil. The readjustment of ideas required to meet
the situation would put a strain on the nervous system of any really
nice-minded bird.
The Cut-throats and Zebras breed so freely that I do not see why
some success should not attend the attempts to breed some of the
less common birds under similar conditions. In future though I intend
to catch up all hens and keep them in a separate enclosure until early
in May.
If this article is not already too long I should like to say how very
grateful I am to some kind lady, who, a year or two ago, gave a descrip-
tion of her feeding box made with the aid of empty spirit bottles.
I use these in both aviaries and feeding is done only once a week. Each
variety of seed (canary, white millet, and Indian millet) is kept separate;
there is no waste of seed and no husks on the floor of the aviary.

Correspondence on Breeding Lutinos
misleading in regard to the lutino factor in birds (particularly budgeri-
gars) has been published, I take the liberty to address you in the
hope that something in what I write may be of assistance to you in
the production of white Alexandrines.
The lutino is an albino pure and simple. The albino form of any
bird with yellow pigment in its feathers is always a pure canary yellow
colour, providing that no other pigment except melanin is present.
If red pigment be present in any portion of the bird albinism would
not remove or alter the red.
The albino form of any bird possessing only colours dependent
on melanin is always pure white. Blue in blue budgerigars and the
blue portion of the green in Budgerigars and in Nyassa Lovebirds
are dependent on the presence of melanin, and the fact that you have
produced lutino (yellow albino) Alexandrines clearly indicates that
this also applies in the case of Alexandrines. Therefore an albino
blue Alexandrine would be white. (I am presuming that the blue
Alexandrine is all blue with or without black).
As you have the albino factor and the blue in Alexandrines, you
should not have any difficulty in producing a bird with both, because
both are hereditarily transmitted without in any way interfering with
each other's system of hereditary transmission.
I presume that you have the albino factor only in your green
Alexandrines, and that the green colour is dominant over the blue,
and that your albino factor is a sex-linked one, as I believe the albino
factor always is.
Then you have green Alexandrine cocks carrying the hidden albino
factor--that is green split albino cocks, and albino green hens (lutinos
or yellow albinos). No hens green in colour can carry the albino factor.
All green hens are totally devoid of any albino factor.
All green sons of lutinos (yellow albinos) carry the albino factor
in a hidden form, that is all such can produce albino hens and split
albino cocks when mated with a normal hen (either a green or a blue
hen). In such mating half of the daughters should, on the average,
be albinos and half pure normals, half of the cocks should carry the
hidden albino factor and half should be pure normals, totally devoid
of any albino factor.

Cock albinos cannot be produced by any other than two matings,
albino hen with albino cock, and albino hen with split albino cock.
Personally I distrust close breeding of members of the parrot family,
and beg to point out that the albino factor can be preserved and
multiplied without such methods.
Please note that when a pair of normal birds produce an albino
the father is a split albino and about half of his sons will also be split
albinos.
To produce a white albino, mate a green split albino cock with
a blue hen. If the cock is a pure green (not a green split blue) all the
progeny will be green split blues. Half of the cocks will be green split
blue split albinos (greens split to both the blue and the albino factors).
Half of the hens will be albino green/blues, that is lutino split blues.
Mate these cocks to blue hens and each of the split albinos should
produce, on an average, one green split blue cock, one green split blue
split albino cock, one blue cock, one blue split albino cock, one green
split blue hen, one albino green split blue hen (this would be a lutino),
one blue hen, and one albino blue hen (this would be a white albino),
out of every eight young ones.
Or mate a blue cock with an albino green (lutino) hen, producing
all cocks green split blue split albino, and all hens pure normals. Then
mate one of these young cocks with a blue hen producing the eight
classes of progeny as above.
My sole object in taking the liberty of writing to you is to endeavour
to give some little assistance in the establishment of albino Alexandrines,
which will be a great acquisition to the bird fancy. It well might be
that you are fully cognisant of the system of hereditary transmission
followed by the albino factor, in which case I owe you an apology for
this intrusion, and tender same in advance. My only excuse is that
I thought you might have been misled by statements published which
in many cases directly conflict with my experience with this factor.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

<bodyText confidence="0.995967714285714" page_id="56289660"  page_num="162" year="" vol="">
I have this day received yours of 22nd ult., also yours of 28th ult.
You have my permission to publish my letter if you think it would
be of sufficient interest to readers.
You have understood me correctly in regard to the daughters of
the lutinos being in no way more valuable for producing lutinos
or albinos than any other Alexandrines of the same colour, but bear
in mind that daughters of blues or of green split blues are just as
valuable as sons for the production of blues.
I maintain that the albino factor and the lutino factor are one
and the same, and that it is not a colour factor, is not related to the
colour factors, and does not in any way interfere with the colour factors,
or with their hereditary transmission. That conception of the factor
is totally inconsistent with much that has been published, yet I have
no doubt whatever on the point. Now see where this will lead us in
connection with the mating you hope will produce a White Alexandrine.
You write, " I am this season trying a blue-bred cock mated to a
yellow-bred hen and wonder if I shall get a white one." I understand
that your yellow Alexandrines are lutinos--that they have red eyes.
If that is correct they are not yellows, they are albino greens. That
is practically certain, though not absolutely so, because albino yellows
and albino greens are of the same colour. If they are yellows, where
did they get their yellow factor ?
So we may take it as almost certain that you are mating a blue-bred
cock with a pure normal green hen, unless one of her parents is a split
blue or a blue (all sons and daughters of a blue should be split blue,
also some sons and daughters of two greens will be split blue if one
or more of the green parents is split blue).
Unless my conception of the factor is entirely incorrect and unless
your yellow albino Alexandrines have near relatives that are yellow
in colour of feathers (probably suffused with green) and normal in
colour of eyes it is useless to expect to produce normal whites from
the above mating. In order to produce white albinos from that
mating, the cock must be split albino and at the same time split blue
or white, and the hen must be split blue or split white, and even then
they could produce only hens in albinos.

I hope I have made it clear that if all your yellow Alexandrines
have red eyes, then you have no reason to believe that, you have the
yellow factor in any of them, and have no reason to expect to be able
to produce the yellow factor in them, and no reason to expect to be
able to produce normal whites by mating your red-eyed yellows (albino
greens) with blues or green split blues.
On the other hand you have every reason to expect to produce
white albinos, for all you have to do is to get your full albino factor
and your full blue factor together in the one bird. As these factors
are both hereditarily transmissible without in any way interfering one
with the other, you should not have any great difficulty.
I would be pleased to know whether I am correct in assuming that
you have no yellow Alexandrines with normal eyes, and would be
grateful for any information regarding the results you obtain.
I think it is yet too early to shout " Halloo " in regard to the
yellow-winged blues in Australia. I have seen (and produced) so-called
yellow-winged greens with body colour largely powder blue colour,
but always the blue in the juvenile plumage has been replaced in
the adult plumage by a rich green, and it may yet be so in the case
of Anderson's yellow-winged blues that have been so widely advertised
all over the world. Of course, it would be a beautiful combination
of colours if retained as described. But I must warn you that yellow-
wings in Australia does not indicate yellow wings but wings like
those of a yellow, usually heavily marked.
Hoping you will have complete success in establishing both the
white and the yellow albinos in Alexandrines.

A series of three talks of especial appeal to nature lovers were lately
given by Tom H. Harrisson, the well-known ornithologist. The general
title of these talks, which were included in the programmes of
13th, 20th, and 27th April, is " Watching Birds ". They were given
with the co-operation of the British Trust for Ornithology.
The three talks were respectively entitled :--

<bodyText confidence="0.998672875" page_id="56289662"  page_num="164" year="" vol="">
The talks stressed the importance as well as the fascination of
watching birds, told of what has already been done in the way of
collecting and collating information, and showed how the ordinary
amateur may assist in this most worthy enterprise.
The Little Owl has been almost universally condemned as a real
sinner in stealing young birds, pheasant chicks in particular. Few
people have any good to say about it. Since the bird was introduced
and established in Kent and Northants, 1874-1890, it has spread very
rapidly ; has now reached Wales and the north of England (not Cumber-
land). Until last year the bird was protected in all but six counties.
Then British Field Sports Society issued a pamphlet entitled " Investiga-
tion into the Food Habits of the Little or Dutch Owl ". The adjective
Dutch represents exactly the attitude and approach of this pamphlet.
The bird is an alien. We do not like aliens. In point of fact it is no
more Dutch than the Nightingale or Pheasant. However, the pamphlet
had a great effect. Nearly every county removed protection from the
Little Owl on the strength of it. Anyone may kill the bird any time.
This year the newly founded British Trust for Ornithology, whose
object is to integrate bird study along unbiased and scientific lines,
has adopted the Little Owl as a subject for thorough, unbiased
investigation from all angles. Miss Hibbert-Ware, of Girton College,
Cambridge, who has made a special study of the bird for twelve years,
is running the inquiry for them. It is hoped that the co-operation
of all shades of opinion will be obtained. The basis of the inquiry is.

the analysis of the pellets thrown out by the Owls after feeding.
Experiments have been carried out at the London Zoo to find out
how far these pellets are an index of the birds 5 total food. In his
talk Mr. Harrisson described exactly how you could co-operate,
and outlined the whole progress of the inquiry to date.
There is no doubt that the Little Owl is very beneficial to the
farmer, and it is extremely doubtful if it is anywhere near as harmful
to the game lover as has previously been supposed. The well-known
story of the owl killing pheasant chicks and laying them out to catch
carrion beetles has never been confirmed by a good unbiased observer.
It ranks in the same category as the snake swallowing its young.
Moreover in the great many pellets examined to date, thousands of
beetles have been found, but not a carrion beetle. There is no doubt
that the Little Owl does kill young game birds in the first few days
of their life, in some places. The co-operation of the landowner and
of keepers is urgently needed to assess the real extent and value of
this damage in relation to the beneficial services rendered in killing
innumerable harmful insects and rodents.
It is a lovely little bird. Let it be given a fair trial. The maximum
of reliable witnesses are wanted to appear. The way of locating pellets
and larders, and of distinguishing them from those of other Owls and
the Kestrel Hawk was described in the talk. The schedule form that
goes with the inquiry was published in advance in the Radio Times ,
and later in the Listener ; Mr. Harrisson explained it in his talk.
Miss Hibbert-Ware has evidence to show that in the past few years
the bird has decreased considerably, quite apart from persecution.
We hope that as many people as possible will co-operate in making
this report nation-wide, and representative of all points of view and
of all parts of the country. Later in the year you will be informed
of the course of the inquiry and its results.

By Dr. J. M. Derscheid, F.Z.S.
I do much admire the beautiful colour plates appearing in the
Avicultural Magazine, especially those by Boland Green, which,
in my opinion, are unsurpassed by any other, except perhaps the
paintings by the late Fuertes and some of those by Wilhelm Kuhnert.
I have recently added to my collection of Parrots and Parrakeets
a pair of White-breasted Caiques ; those birds are generally described
as having no sexual difference, but my birds evidently differ,
not by plumage but by the fact that one (I suppose the male) has
a much broader and heavier head than the second one ; the bill is
similar in both, but the colour of the iris is bright red in the supposed
male and dull brown-red in his mate.
At the end of January, I obtained some pairs of the little Blue
and White Lorikeets (Coriphilus peruvianus) from the Society Islands,
belonging to the same consignment as the Coriphilus imported then
by Lord Tavistock to England. Having inquired about the natural
food of these birds, I learned from Mr. Eastham Guild that those
delightful little birds feed essentially on the nectar of the small, yellow
flower of a tree called puatea by the natives of those islands ; but that
sometimes they are observed drinking the milk of a broken coco-nut, or
one in which the rats have gnawed a hole. As it is always a problem
to find some kind of fresh food in winter for those Lorikeets, when
sweet grapes are difficult to get, the above observation gave me the
idea of providing my Blue Lorikeets every day with fresh coco-nut
milk, slightly sweetened of course, in addition to their usual Lory food.
My birds seem to enjoy greatly this vegetable milk, and are thriving
on that diet, so that I thought that perhaps it would interest some
readers of your Magazine to know about it. Coco-nuts are cheap,
and at the same time their husks properly opened are useful and
inexpensive as nest-boxes for small Finches and even as dormitories
for the smallest Lorikeets. The fresh pulp of the nut is appreciated
as a titbit by a number of my Parrots and even by my Tabuan
Parrakeets (Pyrhulopsis tabuensis).

my pair of Yellow-fronted New Zealand Parrakeets have young
in the nest, these birds having bred in an indoor aviary for the first
time in November, 1935-January, 1936, the first egg of the second
clutch being laid on 10th February. The parent birds were both bred
at Keston in the middle of last summer, so that they may be con-
sidered as a true record of precocity, not only for their genus, but
even I think for any kind of Parrakeets. Naturally I am as a rule
opposed to winter breeding, even for Lories and Lorikeets ; there are
too many risks and deceptions ; for instance, my Scaly-breasted
Lorikeets laid their usual pair of eggs about 10th January in an outdoor
aviary and the young ones were duly hatched three weeks later, but
after a few days their parents viciously killed them, and began to nest
again; I hear from one of my German correspondents, Mr. R. Aumuller,
that exactly the same thing happened in last January to his Scaly-
breasted Lorikeets.

The Committee of the O.P.S. have been extremely busy lately.
Before these notes appear in print we shall have published the first
issue of the O.P.S. Journal. This has not been an easy task. None of
us was versed in the methods of editing or publishing such a pamphlet.
We only hope that it has proved entertaining. Mr. Bennett, who is
incidentally a member of the Avicultural Society, has been arranging
for the exhibition of Pheasants at shows throughout the country. This
has been an arduous undertaking and the members of the O.P.S. should
be grateful to him for his indefatigable labours. I may also mention
that he has arranged for suitable cages of large dimensions to be made
and these will be available for any show that we patronize. This
has meant a heavy outlay of cash, but we think we are justified, for
without such pens the showing of Ornamental Pheasants would have
been impossible.
Then again, Captain Scott Hopkins has been making plans for the
importation of Pheasants from both China and India. These plans
are only in the embryo stage, and much consideration has yet to be

given to them. It is quite possible that if a sufficient number of
members interest themselves in the scheme, and the money is forth-
coming, which we think will be the case, that either Captain Scott
Hopkins, or some Pheasant fancier who is well equipped with the
knowledge of handling and the care of freshly caught specimens, may
travel to Shanghai and Calcutta, there arrange for the purchase of
well-conditioned birds, and finally travel home with them. By this
means we shall be assured of the birds receiving every attention on
the voyage.
The present system of shipping them is inadequate, and the poor
creatures come over under most insanitary conditions. If this scheme
materializes then we shall consider that for this one achievement the
formation of the O.P.S. will have been fully justified. We see no
reason why we should hide our light under a bushel, we have already
accomplished much. We are well aware of the fact that many pheasant
and other bird fanciers looked askance at us when we first formed
this Society. We w~ere in fact told that such a scheme was doomed
to failure as we could not possibly expect sufficient support from the
comparatively few pheasant fanciers in existence.
It is quite true that we have not received support from many
fanciers who we did hope would give us their active and financial
assistance. We have been ignored by some who could have helped
us greatly, nevertheless, I can now definitely state that we are over
the principal obstacles and are now heading for the straight !

The lack of knowledge of our most common British birds is very

very fond of birds, he can never tell one from another. At the same
time there is no doubt that many more people nowadays than formerly,
and especially young people, take a keen interest in birds and wish
to be able to distinguish the various kinds that they may meet during
their visits to the country. Doubtless present-day facilities for transport

are to a great extent responsible for this. It is far easier now to get
amongst the birds than it used to be, and so onr interest in them is
increased.
It is impossible to learn about birds without a teacher, and this
may be a reliable book ; but it must be of a size that enables it to
be easily carried in the pocket for quick reference during our rambles.
It must also have good illustrations, some of which at least should
be coloured.
Such a book has just been written by Mr. Norman H. Joy, M.B.O.U.,
entitled How to Know British Birds, and is published by Messrs.
Witherby in their Bird Lovers' Manuals series, at 5s. net. It will
certainly be found invaluable to those who love the country and want
to know all its birds.

Madam,-- With reference to Miss Grant-Ives's claim that Gouldians do
not require heated aviaries in the winter, may I remind her that one Swallow
does not make a summer.
Although many Gouldians can stand quite a lot of dry, cold weather,
I do not recommend these birds being unduly exposed to the rigours of our
winters, and one must remember our climate is not their natural habitat.
Most of my Gouldians (over forty of them) have been out in unheated
houses all this winter, at an altitude of 850 feet above sea-level, but in spite
of the fact that these are all British aviary-bred (some fourth and fifth
generation) I have been compelled to transfer some to heated quarters, and
I have lost others from unexpected severe frosts, although they have been
in the best of health otherwise.
During the dark months, I provide my birds as often as possible before
dusk with a hurricane lantern which gives sufficient light for them to feed
by, and also the lantern must give off a slight heat yet not usually sufficient
to prevent the water freezing.
In my opinion foreign birds suffer almost as much through not getting
sufficient food in the short hours of winter daylight as from the cold.
I have seven Cordon Bleus that have been in cold, unheated aviaries for
the last two winters, including the wretched one we are still experiencing
(deep snow here 21st April), yet you cannot possibly class these birds as
hardy.

Madam,-- I was very interested in the coloured plate and the article on
the Gibbon Fiery-breasted Bush-shrike in the January number of the
Magazine.
Among my birds I have another member of the genus, Chlorophoneus
starlci, which I reared from a half-grown youngster. It is a large bird, about
9 inches long. The chin is pale yellow, the upper part of the breast is orange,
fading into pale yellow on the under parts. The head is grey ; the back
and wings olive green.
My bird is very tame, though nervous. When handled he never bites
or pecks with sufficient force to hurt.
The ordinary note is a soft whistle, though occasionally, especially when
alarmed, they make a sharp clicking noise followed by a note like " Jeer ",
at the same time bowing the head down, and depressing the beak towards
the breast.
I have said that I reared this bird, but it would be more correct to say
that its parents and I did it between us. It was about half-grown when
I picked it up off the road and, putting it in a cage, placed it on the verandah
where its parents fed it until it was old enough to feed itself. The old birds
were very shy at first, but quickly gained confidence until they would feed
their baby while I stood within a few yards of them.
Every year they make their nest in one of the grape-fruit trees. Last
season they produced two broods of which the bird I possess belonged to
the first. The one and only occasion on which I found the nest was through
hearing the parents uttering their loud, clicking alarm notes. On going to
investigate I found a green tree snake in the act of swallowing one of the
youngsters. I killed the snake and took the three remaining birds and placed
them in a cage, again leaving them on the verandah for the parents to feed.
Unfortunately, about a week later, an army of warrior ants invaded the
verandah ; all that was left in the morning were a few little bones ! In previous
years I have had two others, both of which were either stolen or escaped
before they were old enough to feed themselves.
How any young birds in the tropics manage to survive all the dangers
which beset them on every side, until they are old enough to look after them-
selves, is a mystery. Between the numerous birds of prey, snakes, and
carnivorous animals of every description, it is nothing short of a miracle
that any get away at all. The mortality must be terrific ! I have often seen
hawks clinging on to weaver birds' nests while they drag the young out of them.
I have not infrequently reared birds by placing them in a cage and allowing
their parents to feed them. In this connection I wonder if any other avicul-
turists have noticed a curious fact ? I have on rare occasions found that,
if I left a young bird to be fed until it was full grown, the parents apparently
deliberately poisoned it. At any rate this is the only way I can account
for finding a perfectly healthy bird, which I had left alive and well an hour
before, dead in the bottom of the cage.
It is interesting to read of the care bestowed by bird lovers at home on
some prized specimen which is comparatively common out here. The Sun
Birds, for instance, come in dozens to suck the nectar and catch small flies
from the flowers in the garden. They appear to be particularly fond of
zinnias where they mingle with the gorgeous butterflies in a riot of colour
as they dance from flower to flower.

Then there are the migratory birds, which always seem to me a link with
home. Chief among them are the Swallows, which are now on their home-
ward journey. By the time they arrive here on their travels south they
have lost their lovely gloss and look exactly as though they had gone rusty.
But before they pass this way again, on their return flight, they have assumed
their breeding plumage once more. During their travels to and fro they
roost in thousands in the reeds at the south end of Lake Nyasa.

Madam, --It may interest the members of the Avicultural Society to
know that I have reared a young (or perhaps two) of a New Zealand x New
Hebrides Zosterop. They were in an aviary with odd Mannikins. I had
no idea they had nested till a few days back. I then searched the bush
and found a neat nest rather like a Chaffinch's with (evidently second lot)
three dirty-white coloured eggs in it, but the fuss the parents made caused
me to search further when I saw one young bird in the bush--Green backed
with whitish green under parts ; eye rings were not noticeable. I also have
three young Sugar-birds (Y.W.) ready to leave the nest in a day or two.
I believe we have had a frost practically every night since eggs were laid !

A CRITICISM

<bodyText confidence="0.975176227272727" page_id="56289671"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Madam,-- I fear I cannot find myself quite in sympathy with your eulogistic
review of Mr. Rosslyn Mannering's Parrots , Parrakeets, and Budgerigars.
The book is of very uneven merit and the chapter on budgerigars is so
much the best that it gives the impression that the author is an experienced
budgerigar breeder who has kept one or two parrots and cockatoos as cage
pets. Having set himself the task of dealing with the entire parrot family
he has had to fall back on the opinions of other writers, good, bad, and
indifferent, supplemented by a certain amount of theory of his own, as
distinct from practical experience.
Some good advice occurs here and there, but the ship is constantly spoiled
for a ha'porth of tar and there are a good many errors and unfortunate
omissions. Heat is recommended for sick birds, but the suggested temperature
is about 10* too low to be effective in any but mild cases. Medicine suggested
is, if my memory is not at fault, the useless magnesia instead of the far more
effective syrup of Dimol or Buckthorn.
There is a good deal of information about nests, but the most important
of all " tips "--the placing of the nest in the flight and not in the shelter
is omitted.
Mr. Farrar's incorrect description of the hen Pennant as differing in
plumage from the male is perpetuated and the lack of helpful, if brief, informa-
tion on sexing various species is rather noticeable.

WHEN TO BUY FOREIGN BIRDS
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.860708074074074" page_id="56289671"  page_num="173" year="" vol="">
Madam, --My experience may be in the minority, but with all foreign
birds I have found the late spring and summer the best times for buying
them, particularly for beginners, as the always difficult problems of artificial
heating and lighting are done w r ith. Flowering grasses and flowering shrubs
with their store of insect life--the long days full of sunshine which can be
safely spent out of doors--all help tremendously towards the health and
happiness of delicate birds--giving them a wonderful bloom difficult to obtain
in the winter.
I hope this letter may be crowded out by others full of helpful ideas,
and make it possible for those with small means to buy Parrots at a
reasonable price.
Knowledgeable bird lovers with even a small garden, might well try
some of the exquisite Parrakeets (so sadly in need of increasing their numbers)
now beyond their reach at prices ranging from #10 to #50 a pair. Thus many
valuable opportunities are lost.
If there were some means of quarantine as I believe they have in America
--whereby members could obtain Parrots at a reasonable price, many dreams
might be realized. Birds costing from Is. to 18s. each in their lands should
be from #1 to #2 here. Let us work for the Prohibition of Prohibitive Prices
for Parrots.
Muriel Maxwell Jackson.
PS .--I should like to add that a week or so ago I received a small
consignment of Orange Cheeks in perfect condition packed in a new white
travelling box, zinc ventilated, new zinc drinkers and sponge, also a good
perch, and these for the modest sum of Is. 6d. each from one of the despised
London dealers !

(Dasyptilus pesqueti)
By F. Shaw Mayer
This strange looking but interesting Parrot is found only on the
mainland of New Guinea. Its home is in the foothills of the chief
mountain ranges between 1,000 and 3,000 feet.
Although it was described by Lesson over one hundred years ago
(1830), very little is known about its wild life.
It moves about in small parties, but is nowhere plentiful. Once
I saw five slowly flying along the face of a high cliff uttering loudly
their hoarse grating cries. It was an impressive sight.
They live entirely on soft berries, especially the figs of the ficus
trees. These figs, about the size of cherries, are sweet and sticky.
The parrots chew them up to extract the juice.
They have proved to be rather difficult birds to cater for in this
country.
Lord Tavistock&apos;s famous bird, which he gave to the late Mrs. Dalton-
Burgess in 1923 and was called by her " The General," was probably
the first to reach this country alive. This bird lived for some years
and did better than the many that have been imported in recent
years.

Before 1923 the Crested Argus had remained one of the rarest
and most elusive of all Pheasants. About a dozen skins of the typical
race from Annam and half the number of the darker form from the
Malay Peninsula existed in Natural History Museums, mostly in
England and in France. Very little was known of the life of the birds.
Collectors only reported that they lived in forests and were difficult
to detect.
In his fine Monograph of the Pheasants, vol. iv, pp. 100-3 (1922),
W. Beebe gave a detailed account of what had been written
on this fine species up to that date, and our readers may be referred
to it. We shall only say here shortly that it was first known by
some feathers deposited in the Paris Museum, of unknown origin.
Yerreaux thought it belonged to some new species of Argus and
proposed for it the name of ocellatus in 1856. These feathers were
figured in Elliot's Monograph of the Phasianidx , 1872, vol. i, pi. 13.
Our knowledge of the bird remained unchanged till 1882, when
Maingonnat, a Parisian naturalist and dealer, received the perfect skin
of a male sent by Major Eheinart; it had been captured 15 miles west
of Hue, in Annam, at the foot of the mountains. The collector stated
that he had never seen the bird during his shooting trips, but had
found feathers which are highly prized by the Annamites, who use
them for theatrical head-dresses. Maingonnat exhibited this first-
known skin of a Eheinart at the Zoological Society meeting in Paris,
and recognized that a new genus, Rheinardia, had to be created for
this striking new species. It had to be altered to Rheinartia, as the

name of its discoverer, to whom it was dedicated, was thus spelt.
Several months later, a second specimen was sent by the Governor
of Indo-China, Le Myre de Villers. The bird had been presented alive
to him by the Emperor of Annam. The royal gift had been sent to
the Residency in charge of an escort of soldiers and created great
excitement. In spite of special care, it had soon died. It had been
snared in the neighbouring jungle, on the eastern slopes of the Chaine
Annamitique, which is covered with very damp, often cool, and thick
forests. Twenty years later, Father Renauld, a local missionary and a
keen naturalist, sent more skins to Paris, and gave some useful
information on the bird's distribution and habits.
The Malayan Rheinart ( R . o. nigrescens) was discovered in 1902.
It is very similar to the Annamese bird, but of a darker brown, with
the spots on the back round and white, instead of irregular and bufE.
In the recently published vol. iii of the Birds of the Malay Peninsula ,
Mr. F. N. Chasen gives the following information :--
" As yet known with certainity only from the lower levels of
Gunong Benom and Gunong Tahan in Pahang ... No more than
ten specimens are extant in museums.
" In Pahang, in certain localities, this wonderful pheasant is by
no means rare, though even shyer and more retiring in its habits than
the more familiar Argus Pheasant. It is found in hilly country up to
the level of about 3,000 feet, possibly rather higher, but also occasionally
descending to the level of the larger rivers, though only in dense jungle.
On the lower slopes of Gunong Tahan, it must have been about equally
numerous with the Common Argus, but certainly ranged higher on the
hill . . . Robinson was unable to distinguish the playing grounds of
the two species, and feathers of both were found upon them . . . They
were sometimes very extensive, up to 10 or 15 feet in diameter, and
were most meticulously cleared, every dead leaf, living and growing
seedling being removed."
To come back to the Annamese Rheinart, it was one of the main
objects of my 1923-4 expedition to Indo-China to learn more about
it and to bring back skins and live specimens. Therefore, I spent several
months in the province of Quangtri, some 50 miles north of Hue,
where F. Renauld had collected Rheinarts and discovered Edwards'

Pheasant. Although I spent several weeks in the damp jungle where
they lived and often called, I never saw one, so thick is the
vegetation and so clever are the birds in hiding themselves. Many
times a day the loud call of the male was heard quite close to us,
generally as an answer to a shot, just as the Spicifer Peacock does.
But the bird never could be spotted. It was most extraordinary, as it is
over 2 yards long with its wonderful tail. But nearly one hundred
specimens were snared, both alive and dead. I left Annam with many
skins and forty-two live birds. Unfortunately, they had contracted
diphtheric roup, and nearly all died before being landed in France,
some surviving a few weeks only. As far as aviculture is concerned, it
was a terrible failure.
In the course of the following expeditions (I went six times to
Indo-China between 1925 and 1932) I heard (but never saw) and
collected many more Bheinarts. By taking great precautions, I
managed to avoid contamination and to bring them over in perfect
health, so that now they are quite well established at Cleres, where
they live long, prove hardy, and breed regularly.
From the experience I had of the bird, both at liberty and in
captivity, I have learned the following points :--
The Annamese Crested Argus lives in the damp forests of the
Chaine Annamitique, on the eastern slope only, the western one being
not moist enough. It is found on a long, narrow stretch of hilly ground,
from the province of Yinh, in the north, to that of Qui-Nhon, in the
south, between 14* and 18* 1. N. It haunts the primeval forests only,
from sea-level to about 4,000 feet. It is very shy and difficult to see,
but it is easily trapped, like all the ground birds of the country,
Pheasants, Partridges, and Pittas particularly. For so doing, the natives
build miles of low hurdles across the forest, with an opening every
20 or 30 yards : a snare, made of a flexible vine, is set at each
opening. The birds run along the hurdles and try to get out through
the openings, when they are caught by the leg. They are captured alive
unless some carnivorous animal comes and kills them before they are
found. But often their leg is " ringed " or injured, and in that case
the bird never recovers. Sometimes snares are baited with paddy or
fruit; the bird is then caught by the neck and almost always killed.

J. Delacour--The Rheinart&apos;s Pheasant or Crested Argus 179
The Rheinart never leaves the thick jungle ; it feeds on berries,
seeds, and insects. In captivity it needs a good deal of meat, fruit,
potatoes, and rich mash. It is common in several localities, particularly
abundant between Tourane and Quangtri in the hills, where we have
obtained many, and to-day they still appear to be as common as ever
in the district. But they are not easily obtained, as they inhabit
unhealthy and difficult localities.
Like the true Argus, the cock Rheinart has a playing ground
where he displays in the breeding season, which seems to last the greater
part of the year, as one finds chicks and young, of different sizes at
the same time, and that almost every month.
The display of the Crested Argus is not very elaborate. The bird
stops dead, his crest fully spread and his neck feathers puffed out,
holding his head low and his neck stretched. Suddenly, he shakes
his wings, utters his call, a long, full and melodious whistle of
three notes, and runs around, spreading his tail sideways, like a
Silver Pheasant.
The hen lays two eggs, pinkish buff, with sometimes small spots
of a darker colour. Exceptionally, at Cleres, I had a clutch of three
eggs. She always lays high up, and it is necessary to hang baskets for
her in trees, otherwise, she will lay from the perch and smash her
eggs. The young take a full year to reach their full size, but the sexes
can be told at four months.
They remind one very much of young Argus and Polyplectrons, and
have the same ways ; they are usually quite tame. They are amongst
the prettiest of young pheasants, having two broad whitish buff lines
along the back, of a striking effect. They require the same treatment
as the Argus. The incubation lasts twenty-six to twenty-seven days,
and when the clutch is taken away at once from the hen, she lays
again every fifteen or twenty days, as much as six times from April
to July.
Young Rheinarts grow slowly and are rather delicate till they are
a full year old. They must be carefully sheltered till May of the following
year--they can be left out afterwards, and I find that adult Rheinarts
are perfectly hardy at Cleres in the open all the year round. I never
saw one with frost-bitten toes, and they have stood without trouble

long spells of frost and as low a temperature as 12*. In captivity
they moult in the summer, and the cocks have their full tail by the
end of the year. An old male at Cleres has one of 5 ft. 4 in., which has

never been observed in wild caught specimens. It is truly a marvellous
bird. He and his mate came to Cleres in 1926, after having been kept
two years in an aviary at Hue, where they had bred. To this day, they
are still in perfect health and they have bred every year. They
must be very nearly 15 years old and the species seems to live a
long time. It is of course only natural, as the cocks take their full
tail at four years only, perhaps even five ; I only have bred so far from
birds five years old.
The main difficulty with Rheinarts is to bring them over in good
health. They must be very carefully preserved from roup, as they
are very apt to catch it and always die quickly if they do. It is essential
to use disinfectants and to isolate them carefully. Also, good soft
food, with plenty of meat, banana, etc., is necessary. After a few
weeks in Europe, they can be let out, and then prove perfectly strong
and hardy, more so than many other species of Pheasants.

By P. W. Teague
I have been asked by many prominent aviculturists to write a few
details on a remarkable feat of moving birds and aviaries during their
breeding activities. I carried out what I should unhesitatingly have
said was almost an impossibility, yet this was successfully accomplished,
by a firm of removers, from Kilpeck to Broadway, a distance of about
57 miles. The birds, aviaries, and cages were most carefully
handled and packed on the large vans at Kilpeck about 2 p.m., arriving
at their destination nearly 10 p.m. that night. Fortunately the breeding
aviaries were on the small side, the largest measuring 6 by 6 by 4 feet,
so that the ones containing nests of eggs and young were packed on
the vans bodily, just as they were. Incredible though it may appear,
I did not lose an egg, or a youngster. At the time of my moving,

23rd July, I had Gouldians which had been sitting a couple of days
only and another pair with a nest of six youngsters only two days old.
In addition to these I had pairs of Ruficaudas, Bichenos, and those shy
breeders, Masked Grassfinches, all with young in the nests, as well
as many pairs of Bengalese in cages with eggs or young, yet not a single
pair deserted, every youngster was reared and every fertile egg hatched
and duly reared. When unloaded at Broadway squeaks for food seemed
to come from everywhere, however, the provision of hurricane lamps for
the cages and four aviaries containing young helped matters. It was
not long before the parent birds came off the nests and commenced
feeding in spite of the fact that these birds were not previously used
to lamp light. All the aviaries containing these birds were fitted with
the glass substitute " Sunralite ", and all cages I carefully covered with
a large mesh canvas so that the birds would have light and air.
Undoubtedly great credit for this successful move is due to the removal
contractors (Messrs. Faulkner and Sons, Leominster), who handled the
aviaries and cages very carefully and took a great interest in this work.
In order that the birds should not discover the changed surroundings
I kept the Sunralite shutters up for several days, only removing them
by gradual stages. My aviaries were visited by two prominent
aviculturists from the midlands a few days before I left Kilpeck and
they again visited me a little time after my arrival at Broadway and
saw these birds and nests. Should any of our members contemplate
a removal at such an inconvenient time no doubt this experience will
relieve them of their anxiety about their feathered pets. This month
I shall be moving again from these temporary quarters, but I anticipate
this second upheaval with tranquillity.
Death of old Gouldians. An item worthy of note is to record the
death of three old imported Gouldians when in the moult during the
severe weather we had last February. One pair was purchased in full
adult plumage over nine years ago, and the third an imported cock
over eight years in my possession--a good testimonial to the feeding
methods I gave in the Magazine a few years ago. Strangely enough
these three imported birds usually commenced their moult in
December, but owing to their age and the long, hard dreary winter
I was unable to pull them through even in a well-heated room. It is

182 P. W. Teague--Experiences in Removal and Feeding Methods
interesting to note the old pair produced one or two nests of young
every year. This removes the only imported birds I had in my stud of
forty Gouldians, which now comprises five generations of English
bred stock. Almost all these birds were in ordinary wooden houses
throughout this awful winter, only aided by a hurricane lantern for
night feeding. It speaks well for their stamina, considering we are
living at an altitiude of 850 feet. Another point worth mentioning
is that I have bred them year after year in the same aviaries, and the
last two generations certainly appear larger and stronger than any
I have previously reared. This improvement, I believe is due in some
measure to the use of Iodised Mineral Salts, but before describing these
salts I should like to mention the results of the continued use of clean
gritty sea sand. Possibly some of our members will remember a letter
I wrote about a year ago on the danger of dusty sand in aviaries. By
substituting clean sea sand for the ordinary dusty sand, I have only
had one case of pneumonia during the last three years, and this was
a bird I had exchanged. The use of this clean sand has practically
eliminated dust, which I have concluded was one of the chief causes
of this dreaded disease.
Now to return to the successful experiment of the Iodised Mineral
Salts for aviary birds. I have repeatedly been asked what made me
try these mineral salts. It has been a practice of mine closely to watch
and observe my birds in an endeavour to find out " that something "
which so many of our aviary birds seem to be looking for. Asking
myself what makes birds eat cuttlefish bone, or rub their beaks down
crude rock salt, or why do many birds actually eat soil, and why does
a sick bird often go to the seed hoppers, look at the seed, and then hop
round the aviary still looking for " that something " it cannot find ?
One day when making a purchase at a corn merchants. I happened to
see a leaflet recommending the use of Iodised Mineral Salts for poultry.
There and then I decided to find out the contents of these salts. This
obtained, I decided to try a small dish of the dry mixture on an aviary
of mixed birds. It had not been there long before I noticed it had been
sampled. I removed it for a couple of days and then watched which
birds ate it. To my surprise, I saw the following birds take small
quantities, Gouldians, Ruficaudas, Bichenos, Masked Grassfinches, and

various Waxbills. I have been giving this Iodised Mineral Salts to all
my birds for the last two years with very beneficial results and I can
now confidently recommend its use for all aviary birds, given dry or
a very small quantity mixed in the soft food for those birds that will
take soft food.
The particular brand I use is called " Churn " brand No. 3. Complete
Iodised Mineral Salts for Poultry, and is manufactured by the British
Glues and Chemicals, Ltd., Kingsway, London. I have now received
their permission to give the analysis and to state that they will be
pleased to send any member a small sample upon request, and should
any difficulty be experienced, arrangements will be made for its supply.
The use of these salts seems to supply " that something 55 which
has been puzzling me for years, and which so many birds appear to
be always looking for in confinement. To quote from their letter " the
actual formula of this mineral mixture is as follows :--

Plus 1 oz. Potassium Iodide per cwt. of the mixture
Further notes from the letter are " after 12 years close application
to the study of supplementary mineral feeding to all classes of stock,
we have no hesitation in saying that Sterilized Feeding Bone Flour
is undoubtedly the finest source of mineral feeding, supplying as it
does, in a soft, easily assimilable form and in the natural proportions,
both of the essential elements Phosphorus and Calcium
Although the birds only eat very small quantities I am gratified
.with the results to date, for the general improvement in the young
stock is most noticeable. All my birds and aviaries are supplied with
these mineral salts in the dry form. A newly imported bird gorged itself
to such an extent with the salts that I had to remove it.
I hope the above will be useful as well as interesting, and I may
add I have of course no interest in any of the proprietary articles
I recommend.

To those who are accustomed to thinking that penguins inhabit
only the cold and inhospitable lands of the far south it will be some-
what of a surprise to know that a species of these birds inhabits a
group of islands actually lying on the equator, this is the Galapagos
Island Penguin. I had the good fortune whilst in Bermuda of seeing
five of these penguins at the Government Aquarium. They were
collected from the Galapagos Islands by Mr. Louis Mowbray, who
was cruising round these islands in Mr. Vincent Astor's yacht, some few
years ago. Mr. Mowbray is the originator and patron of the Bermuda
Aquarium, where a collection of the amazing fish from Bermudan and
Galapagan waters are kept under ideal conditions. Besides being an
ardent ichthyologist, Mr. Mowbray is a keen ornithologist, and keeps
several rare birds under ideal conditions. The penguins have an
extremely well planned pool made of concrete and coral and filled with
fresh sea water, which is constantly flowing in, in this pool are kept
shoals of small fish, so that the birds have a constant supply of live
food. Their agility in catching their food is amazing. Unfortunately,
the birds, when they have fed still continue to chase and catch the
fish and out of exuberance of spirit kill a great many, just letting them
fall to the bottom of the water.
Most interesting was the fact that one of these birds was sitting
on a couple of eggs, which had been laid in a small shelter ; they were
due to hatch in a week's time after I left Bermuda. The top of the
enclosure was opened up for me to see the sitting bird, and also to
take some photographs. The sitting bird very obligingly lifted herself
up and showed the two large white eggs. She seemed very solicitous
about their welfare, repeatedly touching them and turning them over.
Our intrusion didn't seem to frighten the sitting bird at all, and after
the photos were taken she settled down on the eggs again.
Contrary to the general notion that penguins do not build bulky
nests, this pair had seized with alacrity on a quantity of coarse reeds,
which had been given to them and constructed quite a fair-sized nest.

It was rather amusing to see the solicitude of the cock bird in going
into the shelter to see how his mate was going on. The mated birds,
and also the three odd birds which Mr. Mowbray said were of the same
sex, all seemed to get on very well together.
The Galapagos Islands are a small and very isolated group of
islands lying directly on the equator in the Pacific Ocean, many
hundreds of miles west of the South American coast.
These islands belong to the state of Ecuador, which seems to take
little notice of them except upon occasion to exploit the animal life.
The feature of these islands is the very unique and distinctive avifauna,
they are also the home of the well known giant tortoises and various
species of strange looking iguanas.
While none of the birds are brightly coloured, they form a wonderful
example of evolution. Darwin, a little over a hundred years ago, first
brought to the notice of the scientific world the striking example of
evolution in the Geospiza Finches which inhabit the various islands.
Since Darwin&apos;s days these islands have been the Mecca of the type
of scientist who thinks it far more important to have huge series of
skins in museums than to leave living species for posterity. Within
recent years expeditions have been working on the islands, one of
which took away as many as 8,000 bird skins. Each succeeding
expedition takes away more skins and to-day there is but a remnant
of the former bird life left. There is little doubt that unless something
is done, and done quickly, the unique bird life of the Galapagos Islands
will be altogether destroyed.
The penguins have, I understand, suffered severely, being the first
birds the so-called ornithologists met with, and being tame like the
rest of the land birds they soon find their way into the skin cabinets.
Mr. Mowbray tells me that this species is now restricted to one single
bay on Albermarle Island.
There is every chance that the little colony in Bermuda will breed
and increase, for not only have they ideal conditions and natural food,
but they have a climate which is not so very different from their own
original home.

Seeing that I have already given some notes on the wild life of
the Kea perhaps a few additional ones on its behaviour in captivity
may be of some interest.
Of all the birds I have ever kept, and at one time or another I have
had a good many species, Keas are my favourites. I am sure that
were these birds widely kept they would be prime favourites, unfortun-
ately, they are not common and are consequently by reason of their
remote habitat rather expensive and difficult to obtain.
The history of my birds had, perhaps better start from the time
they were acquired in New Zealand. They were very kindly procured
for me by my friend, Mr. Kowland Hutchinson. It was the third
attempt on his part to obtain some of these interesting birds for me.
The first lot were young birds and these I understand died in New
Zealand before shipment. Later on a pair were secured and these were
eventually shipped to London, but unfortunately they never reached
these shores, mainly, I think through the butcher believing the popular
fallacy that they were carnivorous and supplying them with mutton
broth ; so upon going to meet my treasures at the London Docks
all I received was an empty crate, a great disappointment.
After being in New Zealand for some time, four birds, three cocks
and a hen, were procured and were very kindly kept for me by another
friend in Auckland, where they were fed mainly on the Maori sweet
potatoes.
The preparation for the transport of these birds was no easy matter,
but it was done by Mr. Hutchinson, who acted as a kind of fairy
" godmother " to me whilst in New Zealand. A very large crate had
to be prepared, consisting of inch thick timber and the whole lined with
zinc sheeting. And owing to the Kea being one of the most difficult
birds to confine in a small space because of its ability to pick and unfasten
any kind of hook, lock or catch, a double front had to be made to the
cage. Buller, the New Zealand naturalist, complained that he was
never able to procure Keas because they managed to get out of anything

in which they were confined. Judging by what the settlers say in the
South Island, the Kea can manage to gain access to sheds, houses,
etc., by opening windows and prising open badly fitting doors and
when once an entry has been made the birds soon play round with
any movable article of furniture or crockery, etc., and in a few hours
there is complete destruction. I have heard of Keas gaining access to
shacks and houses while the owners were away and wrecking every
small movable object. There is no doubt some exaggeration in these
statements as there is in anything to do with the Kea when told by
the general public, but these birds certainly seem to have a very strong
streak of destructiveness in their characters.
Keas love to smash articles made of china or pottery as I have found
to my cost. Coming over on the ship I soon learned to give them only
tins or enamel receptacles for their food and water, for china ones were
immediately seized and banged on the floor until they were broken.
If the birds managed to get hold of anything breakable in their aviary
it was at once smashed to pieces. It is marvellous how a cigarette tin
or metal cup or mug can be entirely flattened by them in the course
of a few days.
Even the double fronts of the cages didn't stop the birds from
escaping, they would undo the inner door, then get in between the
partition and with their feet against the outer front and their back
against the inner gradually work the former open. Once out it took
nearly half a day to recapture them, the large deck house in which
they were kept on the ship was full of all kinds of lumber, under which
the birds found hiding places much to their satisfaction. Being
terrestrial, nocturnal, and nesting and roosting in small caves and
fissures in the rocks, Keas will explore any dark hole or place that the
ordinary Parrot would be frightened to enter, not only that, but
like an owl the Kea can see perfectly well in the dark. It is a strange
sensation to go into the aviary on a dark night and hear the birds
flying about and feel them touch one with their beaks and yet be
unable to see them. The birds are just as active in the day as at night,
and I have never seen them sleep, in fact I don't believe they do. At
Mount Cook they can be heard flying round all night. When loose
in a room the Kea is one of the hardest birds to catch, not because he

S. Porter--The Kea
is wild, for all Keas are naturally quite tame, but just because he loves
to play " hide and seek " under the furniture.
In spite of the formidable beak which we are told is used for tearing
sheep to pieces (!) I have never been bitten by a Kea ; when once
caught they don't seem to mind being handled in the least. Two girls
told me of an unusual experience when staying for the night in a lonely
hut in the Southern Alps of the South Island. After they had retired
to rest a gentle tapping was heard on the door, which was repeated at
frequent intervals, the occupants were terrified and at last found enough
courage to slip on some clothes and with a big stick go and see who the
unwelcome visitor was, which as you may guess, was a Kea. Tales
told of the intelligence of these birds are legion and after my experience
with them, I can believe a great many of them. When freshly caught,
instead of being a terrified captive like most birds the Kea will quietly
deliberate on the situation until he has formulated in his mind some
manner of escape.
Recently I gave a talk on the Kea at a local natural history society,
and wishing to illustrate my talk wfith a live bird, I put a large Parrot
cage in the Kea's aviary, holding the door open with a piece of wire,
which I held ready to let the door drop when a bird walked inside.
I baited the cage with an apple which was placed in the middle of the
sand tray so that the birds would have to go inside to get it. The Keas
were far too intelligent for my simple method, after a few minutes
deliberating they closed the door, pulled out the sand tray and thus
got the apple through the opening at the bottom, and they had never
seen a parrot cage before !
They have a large enamel tray for a bath which holds several
gallons of water, this they love to empty with a cigarette tin or cup,
each bird having a turn at baling out the water. Like children, they
love to play about with water, and are never happier than when banging
articles about in their water tray and making a splash.
Owing to the neighbours objecting to their nocturnal calls I had
to have a sound proof house made for them in which they are closed
every night, these calls by the way, are to my ear, at least, quite
pleasant, being like the mewing of a Herring Gull, though several of
the neighbours whose ears are not attuned to bird music have said it

sounded like a woman being strangled ! But not many of them have
heard these wild cries ringing and echoing in the wild and romantic
gorges in those far away mountains as I have done, if they had, perhaps
they would find music in those long drawn out nocturnal wails. I have
many visitors to see my birds, but all agree that the Keas are the
most interesting of them all, the birds take quite as much interest in
the visitors as the visitors do in them.
My five birds I have now had for several years and they remain
in perfect condition mainly due to the fact that they have a large
space for flying round and are kept outside all the year round, they
never seem happier than when the snow falls, they tumble and play
about in it like children. Their food consists of all manner of root
vegetables, such as artichokes, parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips,
etc., also apples, various nuts, and there is always a pot containing
a mixture of coarse terrier meal and white parrot maize from which
the birds can help themselves if they feel inclined but I do not think
much of this is eaten. I believe the birds in the New Zealand " Zoos "
are fed on dry maize and are sometimes given meat, needless to say
they do not survive very long.
I often feel that I would like to try my birds at liberty, but I am
afraid that it would be quite impossible to keep them in a state of
liberty, not so much on account of them straying, but owing to the
fact that their hawk-like appearance would make them an irresistible
target for the marauding " sadist " with a gun, whose excuse for killing
any other bird than a game bird, is that " it looked like a hawk
Two of my birds frequently mate and feed each other, so I have
hopes that they may nest, but this will be difficult with the other birds
in the aviary, though the Kea seems to be a very gregarious kind of a
bird and delights in the company of its fellows.
The method of feeding is peculiar, the root is held by the upper
mandible and is scrapped or grated away by the lower with a sideway
motion, the inner surface of the lower mandible has a roughened surface
by which the bird is able to grate the flesh of the root.
I am never tired of watching Keas and their curious and intelligent
ways, I only wish they were easier to obtain and could then be enjoyed
by other aviculturists.

By Mrs. A. F. Verey
Some time ago I wrote about breeding Blackbirds for colour.
I bad some success in 1934 with breeding, but very little in rearing,
my crop for that year being a very pale whitish grey cock that I call
silver, a cream hen, and one or two normals.
The cock was the son of " Mistletoe 53 by her son of the previous
year, a normal black cock which had one white feather on his shoulder,
after the first moult, and one on the forehead after the second. The
hen was by the brother of this cock from an aviary bred hen with no
white blood. There were black cocks from this nest.
I had been closely inbreeding other pairs, mostly brother and sister.
Many of these nests were lost because both parents were inexperienced,
and I found that the young cocks were not very clever at providing
sufficient food for the nestlings so that the hens had to leave them so
often for food that they got chilled, and being so inbred they were
not strong enough to survive.
I also made some bad mistakes in diet, notably by giving too many
mealworms, instead of earthworms.
I was very fortunate in being given a cream hen from the same
district in Bognor, in which Mistletoe was bred, and in 1935 this hen
was mated to the " silver " cock, but did not nest.
The other young cream hen was mated to the cock with the white
feathers and also failed to nest, but the cock from the same nest was
paired with Mistletoe, that is grandson to grandmother, and produced
one chick in the first nest which died at a few days old during some
very bad weather. This chick was white.
There were five chicks in the second nest, four being white, one
died from overcrowding at three days, and one was a mottled darkish
colour. This bird had deformed joints and although I had hoped to
keep it alive and see what colour it would turn out I had to have it
destroyed for its own sake. Mistletoe made a third nest, but some
Greenfinches insisted on laying in it, and the resultant battle destroyed
the eggs. She nested again, all unfertile. However, I reared three,
a cock and two hens.
There were a pair, brother and sister, that were mated in 1934, and

had lost all their chicks, but I left them together. They hatched four
in the first nest--two white, two normal. The normals died almost at
once. Then one white looked sickly, and I took it out at about four
days old, but it died. I helped the mother feed the last one for a day
or two, and then found it so poorly one morning that I took it away
at seven days and hand-reared it sucessfully. It was a cock, and reached
maturity, but was accidentally killed a short time ago.
This pair had a later nest of three. Two were white, and one of a
peculiar plum colour which died. The two whites lived, and one hen
is now in the Zoological Gardens.
As far as I can tell, both sexes carry the white colour factor equally.
I hope to breed from the young whites this season, but the silver cock
is such a bully that I have had to remove the cream hen he was with
last year and put her with the cock with the white mark. Unfortunately
she had just laid her first egg when this cock died, and although I
hurriedly replaced him, she deserted after laying three eggs.
Mistletoe, mated to the same cock as last year, nested, had a fight
with a wild hen through the wire, and being very badly injured,
deserted. She has now laid three eggs and is due to hatch in about a
week. I hope for the be&amp;u, but as she is getting old and this is her
sixteenth nest, I cannot expect too much.
Mr. Scott has lent me a beautiful cinnamon hen, which I have put
with a 1934 cock, which is the father of several whites, and I hope
to get some interesting results. I was very sorry to lose the two dark
youngsters last season. They might of course have moulted back to
normal, or been speckled black and white. It was a blow too, to lose
the cock with the white feathers. He was a most reliable father, besides
siring the " silver He also had a habit of making a display when
courting. I have seen a pair frequently use the top of a box about
20 inches square as a dance room, both birds taking up the same
attitude, beaks touching, flights and tail feathers expanded and
touching the ground, then slowly circling round each other and a
central point. " White feathers " made a circle of grass in a secluded
corner in which he would ofier his mate small pieces of grass. I am
sure from the slight marks in the peat dust that he also danced, but
I was never able to approach without disturbing him. I found him
dead in his playground with a piece of grass still in his beak.

The first Varied Lorikeets we ever possessed here at the Keston
Foreign Bird Farm arrived in February, 1930, and were brought over
to us by an Australian trapper.
There were, as far as I can remember, four in a collection of mis-
cellaneous birds, and as it is a little known species and rarely imported,
into this country at any rate, the amount of reliable information to
be gained from books was nil.
The four birds appeared to be identically alike, but as the sexes
of most Lorikeets are the same this was not to be wondered at. Hope-
fully I paired them off as I thought, but none of them ever looked
inside a box and eventually as their aviaries were badly wanted for
other birds they were all sold.
The next lot that arrived here came unexpectedly during the early
part of 1935. The consignment consisted of more than four birds and
now my previous mistake of sexing was all too obvious--I had been
trying to breed with four hens ! The cocks, I saw, have a great deal
of mauvy red on their throats and upper breast, whilst the hens, although
possessing a certain amount of this colour on their throats, the area
of it was, I realized at once, not nearly so extensive, and the colour
not nearly so intense.
Although I did not cherish much hope of breeding, I put several
pairs into separate small aviaries, supplying some of the pairs with
log nests and some with deep boxes with wire ladders inside. All
were promptly used as bedrooms and the birds remained housed in
this way throughout last summer and winter.
About December I thought I heard feeding noises coming from one
of the nests, but as the box was almost impossible to look into without
seriously disturbing the birds, I left things quite alone. After a time
the noises ceased, so presumably the young (if any) had died.

Alec Brooksbank--Breeding the Varied Lorikeet in Captivity 193
About March, Lord Tavistock and my partner, E. J. Boosey, were
going round the aviaries together, and as there was such a mystery
about the existence or otherwise of the young Lorikeets they decided
they would look in to see what was happening. So with the help of
a torch they managed to peer down to the bottom of the nest where to
their great astonishment (and mine when I heard about it !) they saw
some youngsters, probably hatched about fourteen days or so. In
looking in they had of course greatly disturbed the parents, who now,
we all thought, were sure to desert, but as soon as everyone was out
of sight they eventually, and much to our relief, went back into the box.
From March to May I heard feeding noises again and on 14th May
one youngster emerged. It was exactly like the hen only had a rather
beautiful spot of yellowy-orange feathers on the back of its neck, which
is entirely lacking in either of the adult birds. By night the parents
had induced it back into the nest where it stayed until the 16th, since
when it has grown considerably and is almost as strong and large
as its parents.
The birds have always been fed on our Lorikeet food and sweetened
stewed apple, no further extras of any kind were given when they were
feeding the youngster, which can now take care of itself.
For those who are not familiar with this very beautiful little
Lorikeet the following description is taken from Lord Tavistock's
book, and the photo, which accompanies this article was taken by me
of the parents last summer :--
Distribution--Northern and Western Australia.
Colour--Green, faintly tinged with vinous on the back and flanks.
Crown and feathers between eye and beak, red. Upper breast vinous
tinged with green and streaked with gold. Cheeks and back of neck
slate-coloured streaked or speckled with gold. A large gold patch in
the region of the ear. Breast and abdomen streaked with gold ; back
and wings faintly streaked with pale green. Tail pointed and not
very long. Bill red. Total length, 8 inches. Size about that of a
Peach-faced Lovebird.
As discretion is the better part of valour, I have refrained from
calling this article " Breeding the Varied Lorikeet for the first time
in captivity " although actually I believe this to be the case.

In looking through six month's issues of the Avicultural Magazine
which have accumulated during my residence abroad I see that there
has been quite a lot of controversy regarding " Dealers versus
Collectors I wish some of the supporters of the importation of birds
en masse could have seen a collection of birds on the ship on which
I travelled home. These were consigned from Shanghai and Singapore
to two dealers, one in England and another in Holland. At the start
there must have been well over 10,000 birds. These consisted mainly
of Java Sparrows, Bengalese, Spice Finches, Pekin Robins, Chestnut
Buntings, Chinese Laughing Thrushes, and various other common birds,
such as one sees in the various dealers shops.
The Java Sparrows were packed at the rate of 280 in cages 12 by
16 by 36 inches, every perch was covered by the birds and so was the
wire netting front and the bottom of the cages, birds sat sometimes two
and three deep on each others backs, those which were not able to
reach the seed tin which was always crammed with birds, died of
starvation, the others, Bengalese, Spice birds, etc., were all housed
under similar conditions. The Pekin Robins were packed, a hundred
at a time in cages 5 by 34 by 20 inches, Laughing Thrushes a hundred
in cages 9 by 33 by 20 inches. Mongolian Larks, four in cages 8J by
7J by 6 inches. Four Lilford's Cranes were sent on board trussed up
with rope and with no cage or crate, the owner said he intended them
to travel thus to Holland, the captain of the ship ordered a crate to
be brought, consequently a basket 2 ft. 10 in. in diameter and 2 ft. 8 in.
high was provided, which was a foot less in height than the birds !
Fortunately the First Officer, being a humane man, had a large crate
built for them. Sand Grouse were accommodated in boxes not much
larger than cigar boxes. Mammals including monkeys, slow loris,
bears, and squirrels were shipped under the same disgraceful conditions.
The sole diet for all these birds, seed-eaters and insect-eaters, was
rice with a little red millet for the Bengalese. Hundreds died every
week, handfuls of dead were consigned overboard every day. The
Laughing Thrushes owing to improper food ate each other alive at

only to show a speck of raw flesh or blood and it was seized upon by
its starving companions and soon devoured. By the end of the voyage
not half of the birds survived to tell the tale. The survivors were taken
no doubt and housed fairly decently in the dealers' shops and will
in the course of time be sold to those who rather than pay a collector
or reputable dealer a few shillings more per pair choose to encourage
such shameful traffic. These people are rather like the women who,
buying a fur, choose to close their eyes to all the horrors which have been
enacted before the soft luxurious pelt is displayed in softly carpeted
West End saloons. They choose to close their eyes to the fact that for
one pair of birds sold in the shops perhaps seven or eight pairs have
died miserably during the transportation. This consignment of birds
is no exception, nearly all the birds sent in large quantities from both
Africa and the Far East are shipped under similar conditions.
The owner of the birds stated that he had allowed for at least half the
consignment dying and even then he would make a fair profit on the
survivors.

underpart yellowish green, with pale fawn flanks, I am hoping the
bird will take after both parents. The parents have young again in
the same nest--when I looked there were four eggs, but I doubt if
more than one or two will be reared. However, the young bird of the
first nest is frequently catching flies and taking them to the nest, so
I am leaving him in the aviary for the present.
I put no extra food--only the usual fruits, mealworms, and soft
food, the last named they rarely touched, also the milk sop I put was
never touched, although the pair of Lateralis that I have in another
division--that enjoy eating their eggs !--delight in milk sop.

All members of the O.P.S. received the first issue of our journal
on or about 1st June. Since its despatch we have received many
letters of congratulations and this is a great encouragement to us.
The launching of the journal can be said to be our first big financial
effort to encourage all pheasant fanciers to join our Society, and I feel
very confident that I shall be kept busy enrolling fresh members
for some time. M. Delacour writes a most thrilling account of his
visits to Indo-China when he successfully sought the Edwards and
Imperial Pheasant. Mr. Leland Smith tells us of the progress of the
pheasant fancy in America. Herr Stefani describes the Blue Crossoptilon
Pheasant. There is a splendid article by the late Mr. Bradshaw of
Australia. Just as the journal was going to print we heard of his death
and this was a sad feature of the journal. Mr. Paul Schmidt of Yugo-
slavia discusses conditions in his country and writes in particular
about the Fireback Pheasant. M. Malisoux, who is known to readers
of this Magazine has some very wise and clever remarks to make
about the thinning of eggs just before hatching, advice that may
mean the elimination to a large degree of " dead in the shell ". A
poetical appeal is made by Mr. Edwards of Wales, he suggests that

his country is a natural environment for most ornamental Pheasants
and surely he is right. Mr. Balfour, also known to your readers, tells
us of his novel method of erecting aviaries and also urges all fanciers
to beautify their aviaries by planting shrubs and plants. Mr. Webb
of Northern Ireland, thinks the dry feeding of chicks is quite as beneficial
as the wet method so much in vogue. His argument appears very
sound. To finish the world-wide appeal we have Miss Chawner, your
worthy Editor, representing England. She asks for the active support
of all pheasant lovers and ends her article by a delightful touch of
humour.
Articles from our oldest and youngest fanciers were a happy touch
and these were most worthy efforts. Space will not allow me to deal
with any more features, but may I remind readers of these notes that
I shall be very pleased to send a free copy, post paid, to any member
of the Avicultural Society.
It will only be necessary to send full name and address. I am
sure this journal will intrigue you : it is something quite original,
and has a soul all its own.

AN UNUSUAL WAXBILL

Madam, --The WaxbillMr. Wilson descibes, in the June number (p. 174) must
I think, be an example of what Mr. W. L. Sclater described at the October
meeting of the B.O.C., 1926, as Estrilda xanthrophrys, Buff-browed Waxbill.
{Bulletin, xlvii, p. 32). The description was based on two birds obtained by
M. Delacour alive in Marseilles and presented by him to the Museum.
The habitat was tentatively given as Senegal, from their place of purchase,
the headquarters of the Senegal bird-trade, but this was corrected later
(p. 120) to Abyssinia. I saw the two original skins and recognised them as the
same as some I had seen in Mr. Whitley's collection, one of which was exhibited
at the C. P. Show, February, 1927 (see Avicultural Magazine, 1927, p. 86),
and one identified at the Museum.
Mr. Whitley's birds, he knew, came from Duidua in Abyssinia and some

were known to have " gone astray " at Marseilles, and so probably provided
the source of those bought by M. Delaeour.
Mr, Sclater considered them a sub-species of Eslrilda troglodytes (late
cinerea), the Grey Waxbill.

Madam, --Perhaps it would interest Miss Hibbert-Ware to hear of my
experience of the Little Brown Owl, as I see the British Trust for Ornithology
has adopted this little Owd, as a subject for investigation.
When I was living in Rutland a few years ago, I kept some Bluette Pigeons
and Faintails in two pigeon cotes in different parts of the garden. For
some time the Pigeons kept disappearing, and were found on the ground,
half eaten, and I put this down to rats or stoats, until I began to have my
suspicions aroused, so kept a close watch, and actually caught the little
devil in the pigeon cote killing a Pigeon, so immediately got a friend of mine
to bring her rifle along very quietly and she was successful in shooting it
in the very act, and thus cleared up the mystery of this destructive bird
murderer, a species of bird which will never be a favourite of mine. It had
" cleared off " several Fantails and Pigeons before being found out.

THE DANGER OF YEW
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.983622294117647" page_id="56289708"  page_num="198" year="" vol="">
I was very interested to read in the April Avtcultukal Magazine the
notes by Mr. Haines, " Is Yew dangerous in Aviaries ? "
I firmly believe that at a certain time of the year, namely end of June and
beginning of July, when the yew begins to shed, that it is deadly poison to
Budgerigars, as I have had experience in this respect. I have an aviary under
some yew-trees, where the bits of yew fell through the wire-flight, and I saw
the Budgerigars actually nibbling the pieces of yew off the ground and in less
than twelve hours they were dead. A year before I had branches of yew put
over another aviary to shade it from the hot sun, and at the end of June
the dried bits had fallen into the flight, and I lost a great many that year,
not knowing why they died. I did not realize till last year that it was
definitely the yew that poisoned them. I conclude that when the yew turns
brown it is very poisonous, and at other times of the year does no harm.
I should be interested to hear if any other fancier has had a similar experience,
one lives and learns by experience, and that is my experience ; and I shall
always believe that was the cause of their death.
J. M. Grant-Ives.

THE CHARM OF PHEASANT-KEEPING
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992429418604651" page_id="56289709"  page_num="199" year="" vol="">
I have the pleasure of knowing Miss Chawner and I know that she has a
soft place in her heart for fancy Pheasants. So I am hoping she will be able to
find space in the Avicultural Magazine for the article on " Ornamental
Pheasants It is very gratifying to see the increased interest that is being
taken in fancy Pheasants. I have often wondered why more people do not
keep these lovely birds. I have kept them for many years, and the longer
I have them the keener I become. I have tried through articles in the
Avicultural Magazine and other papers to get people interested and perhaps
I have succeeded in a small way. But it was not until my friend Mr. Lambert
came to the front that things got really going. He is to be congratulated on the
zeal and keenness he has shown. We often see each other and talk about the
Pheasant world in general. It is thanks to Mr. Lambert that the O.P.S. was
inaugurated and is proving such a success and a boon to those who have
Pheasants for sale. Miss Grant-Ives is proving herself such an efficient and
workmanlike secretary that members are rolling in every week. There is no
doubt whatever that this Society has been the means of stimulating people's
interest in this fascinating hobby. I am delighted to see M. Delacour's name
as a member. I have the pleasure of knowing this very keen aviculturist
and have paid two or three visits to his aviaries at Cleres. I have bought many
Pheasants from him, mostly the rare varieties. He has a truly wonderful
collection. I understand M. Delacour has invited the members of the O.P.S.
to visit his aviaries in August. Go, and you will not regret it. You will see
many other tropical birds besides Pheasants, and you may see some monkeys,
and Parrots flying about his park. Just a few words about the O.P.S.
Mr. Lambert and I have had several talks on this subject from time to time
and our main purpose in starting this society is to encourage more and more
people in the keeping of fancy Pheasants. That object is certainly being
attained already. Mr. Lambert tells me that the demand and interest in these
birds is rising rapidly. It has been, moreover, for the last two years, because
the more people who see these lovely birds the more they wish to obtain
possession of them.
But that is not our only object in forming this society. We want to try
to save from total extinction some of the rarer varieties, by importing and
breeding them in Europe. As M. Delacour remarks, there is real danger that
this will take place very shortly if something is not done at once. As it is he
tells me that that beautiful Pheasant, the Mongolian, is nearly extinct. Some
of you will gape and discredit this statement, because you may see from time
to time advertisements in the Field, " Pure Mongolians " for sale. They were,
no doubt, pure some years ago, but other blood has crept in since then !
We must get going and import these birds before it is too late. I am glad that
Miss Grant-Ives mentioned this in her weekly notes in Cage Birds. I lay much
stress on this point. By the way, talking of Cage Birds , I am delighted to see
so many Pheasants advertised for sale in this weekly paper. I hope before

another year or two we shall see several of the rare varieties changing hands
through the medium of this most useful paper. Another advantage we
Pheasant lovers hope to gain and that is that we shall be able to correspond
with each other and exchange birds and thereby get fresh blood into our
aviaries. With many of the rarer varieties this is most essential. So much
in-breeding means sickly chicks, weak constitutions, and malformed feet.
I could quote numerous instances of this. I will just mention one. M. Delacour
was the first and only importer of the very rare Imperial Pheasant, with the
result that this Pheasant is terribly in-bred by now. This also applies in a
lesser degree to the Edwards and the Elliot. All these birds, I believe, were
first brought into this country by M. Delacour. We, indeed, owe a debt of
gratitude to this gentleman. I am glad to say that Mr. Lambert has been
able to import some Elliots from America this winter, which arrived here in
good condition. These birds, of course, will be unrelated to those in this
country. I have taken advantage of this importation and purchased a pair.
I am very fond of this Pheasant. He is a hardy fellow, very beautiful, easy
to rear, and easy to sell. I gave #25 for my first pair, you can now buy a pair
for #10. They have an added attraction in that they attain full plumage the
first year. I recommend this species to a beginner. Talking of importing
Pheasants, I have at this moment well over #100 worth of Pheasants on their
way to this country from India, from where so many of our most beautiful
Pheasants come. The Satyr Tragopan, which takes pride of place in my
estimation, hails from India. He is a gem and will eat from your hand a month
or less after arriving in this country. The Monaul or Impeyan, the Cheer,
and the Koklas all come from the same part of the world. My consignment
consists of all these species, but mostly Tragopans.
It is unfortunately, with few exceptions, the only means of procuring
these lovely birds. There are few in this country and they are not good
breeders. If anyone wants to do a really good turn to the O.P.S. I suggest he
imports some Lady Amhersts from their native China. They are badly wanted
over here. It is pitiable to see the number of so-called pure Amhersts which are
being sold in this country. Ninety per cent are not pure. It is a pity that the
male bird of this graceful Pheasant becomes so vicious in the breeding season
and often ends in cold-blooded murder. But no collection is complete without
this bird. If proper care is taken during the breeding time casualties will be
considerably lessened.
The breeding season will soon be with us. By the time these notes are in.
print we shall be gathering eggs from the Elliot and Peacock Pheasants, the
first to lay. The Peacock Pheasant is a truly delightful little bird, very hardy,,
most graceful, and very tractable. But beware my friends. Do not give him
more than one hen and do not put other Pheasants with him at other times
of the year. If you do, you have signed their death warrant. I do not recom-
mend Firebacks to beginners. I see Mr. Lambert gives this same advice in.

I hope the Editor will not think I have taken up too much of her valuable
space.
I will finish up by wishing all my fellow fanciers the best of luck for 1936.
I hope if any members of the O.P.S. happen to be up this way that they will
come and visit my collection, which I believe is the best in this country.

A SOILED COCKATOO

<bodyText confidence="0.980189611111111" page_id="56289711"  page_num="201" year="" vol="">
Madam, -- I shall be most grateful if you can advise me as to how to clean
and to maintain in good condition the plumage of a white lemon-crest
Cockatoo ( C . galerita). The bird has never been caged or chained and lives
on a collection of large branches whose extremities are supported on two
parrot stands placed about 6 feet apart. The branches, cherry, silver birch,
walnut, oak, etc., are obtained from the country to avoid London soot. My
house in on the high ground at Blackheath and the room in which the bird
fives is a study.
The bird's feathers are perfect in form but never clean, in fact the lower
portions and legs are almost black. The bird has little or no natural powder.
The protected feat ers under the wings are snowy white and pale lemon.
Whether dry cleaning by powder or bathing with soap is best is not known.
A certain oil or grease on the feathers appears to attract and adhere to every
particle of carbon dust in the air. I am at a loss as to the cause or remedy.
Two Roseate Cockatoos under similar conditions keep perfectly clean in
the same room.
N. Hudson.

RED HEADED GOULDIAN COCK
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.985446153846154" page_id="56289712"  page_num="202" year="" vol="">
Madam, -- I have a Red-headed Gouldian cock in one of my aviaries
whose description might interest Gouldian breeders. I bred this bird in
August, 1934, from an imported Red-headed hen, and aviary bred Black-
headed cock which were quite normal in colour.
The bird is almost black except for the scarlet head, and breast which is
more orange than yellow.
The purple on the upper part of the breast is heavily marked with black
feathers and the wings are black except for a few dark olive green feathers.
The plumage has been rather "fluffy" during the winter, but since
being put into an outdoor aviary the feathers have tightened up, and the
bird is getting into very good condition.
I hope to try to breed from him this summer.
Mrs. Kathleen Wilson-Jones.

The Chestnut-breasted Finch occurs throughout the greater part
&amp;lt;of tropical Northern Australia, extending to the east as far as New
South Wales. Several local races have been described, one of which,
M. lepidothorax cayley, from the Northern Territories, is figured in
our plate.
In the past this species has been imported into Europe in some
numbers, and has proved fairly hardy and been bred on several
occasions.
The nest is an untidy domed structure composed of grass, and
generally built in a thick bush or nesting box. Four or five eggs are
laid, incubation occupying about fourteen days.
Canary and millet seed form its principal diet in captivity, but
green food, such as chickweed and flowering grass, is also necessary,
.and insectivorous food when young are being reared.
This is a handsome species and a typical Mannikin, closely allied
to the Yellow-rumped Finch, M. flaviprymna, with which it probably
occasionally produces hybrids in the wild state.

By J. Delacour
Nothing can be more interesting to the aviculturist than the keeping
on his grounds of foreign birds at complete liberty, with the full use
of their wings. But it is not a very easy thing to do successfully, as
it requires good experience of the suitable species and a certain care
in establishing them.
The larger the space one can control, the easier it is to succeed, but
some very sedentary species will be quite content to settle down in
a small garden ; it is only a question of choosing suitable birds according
to the ground under consideration.
The best and most numerous experiments for keeping and establish-
ing birds at liberty have been made by the Duke and Duchess of
Bedford at Woburn Abbey, where many species of waterfowl, game-
birds, Cranes and Pigeons, have now been living and breeding free
for many years ; also our readers know of the many successes of the
Marquess of Tavistock with Parrakeets, Weavers and Waxbills.
There are Macaws breeding at liberty at Lilford Hall. At Foxwarren
Park, Mr. A. Ezra has many full-winged Sarus Cranes breeding, and
he has established there Red Junglefowl, Chukar Partridges, Tigrini,
and other Doves, as well as Carolina and Mandarin Ducks, Fulvous
Tree-ducks, Meller's, Rosy-billed Ducks, and some others. There
are several flying Parrots in the Whipsnade Zoo, and many full-winged
waterfowl at Walcut Hall, Kew Gardens, etc. At Cleres I also keep
at liberty several species of Geese and Ducks, Pheasants, Screamers,
Doves, Parrots, and Cranes.
Perhaps it will be useful to our members to hear of these various
experiences, successes as well as failures, which have taken place at
my own home and at other places, on which I have information.
I am not going to write here about the few flightless birds such as
Ostriches, Rheas, Emus, Weka Rails, and Kagus, which, of course, are
easy to keep at liberty, as they can be confined by any five or six foot
fence. It is the same with all pinioned birds. I will make one exception
only, to say that Scarlet Ibises are well worth keeping pinioned in a.

garden from April to November, as they will feed mostly on worms
and insects and quickly regain, or retain, their lovely vivid red dress.
Naturally, experiments on full-winged birds must be carried out
with species which are naturally sedentary ; but, with special pre-
cautions, a certain amount of success can be attained with more or
less migratory birds. The largest birds that can be kept full-winged
are the Cranes. But only tropical species of sedentary habits give
good results. Others, such as Manchurian and European Grey Cranes
can be induced to stay, even breed, but sooner or later they may
go away. Some are most satisfactory and stay very well, only some-
times straying a few miles in search of a suitable breeding place. Most
probably, Australian and Eastern Sams would also prove successful,
but I know of no experiments with them. Stanleys and Crown Cranes
are also good stayers, but Demoiselles will practically always go,
even young birds bred on the spot, as I have tried it.
With Cranes, it is always necessary to keep the birds with cut
feathers for a year on their ground, and for doubtfully resident species,
to have only the male fly, the hen being pinioned. The drawback
of full-winged Cranes, especially Sarus, is that they may go to other
birds' paddocks, kill them and destroy eggs and chicks. But
there is no finer thing to watch than these huge birds circling round
in the sky or flying low over the country.
Outside of the Common Mute Swan, no other species is suitable
for keeping full-winged. I have not tried Black-necked Swans nor
Coscorobas ; Black Swans usually migrate, although a few full-winged
ones have stayed at Woburn.
Cereopsis Geese invariably stray very soon. Of other Geese, the
South American Chloephagor (Magellan, Ashy, and Buddy-headed)
are excellent stayers ; very probably, Andean, Maned, and Abyssinian
Blue-winged Geese would also prove satisfactory. Egyptian and
Orinoco Geese stay also perfectly well, but the former are very dangerous
to young Ducks, and cannot be recommended. Of the true Geese,
all are migratory, therefore not very suitable, Grey Lags and
Canadians have been kept free with some success, as well as White-
fronted and Lesser Snow Geese ; but they wander about a good deal,
and every year many disappear. Imported Bar-headed Geese usually

fly away, and so do young birds in their first autumn ; but if their
feathers are clipped in their first years, they generally stay afterwards
with full wings ; this, at least, is the experience of the keeper at Kew
Gardens, and this method could be tried with other species. The
different Sheldrakes,'even the resident species such as the Paradise and
South African, have not proved satisfactory with me, and young
birds went away soon after they could fly ; but more experiments
would be necessary to be able to tell with certainty. At the Rome
Zoo, Common Shelducks breed and fly about without leaving the
grounds ; they are most attractive on the wing. Wild Muscovies are
good stayers and amusing in their way of perching on tall trees, and
I think the White-winged Wood Ducks would behave similarly.
Their smaller allies, the lovely Mandarin and Carolina Ducks, do
perfectly well at liberty, even in quite a small place, and most of the
residents species also do well; excellent results have been obtained
with Meller's, Yellow-billed, Spot-billed, and Australian Mallards,
Chiloe Wigeons, Chilian Pintails, Chestnut-breasted Cinnamon, and
Chilian Teal, Red-crested Pochard, Rosy-billed, Madagascar White-
eyes, White-faced, Red-billed, Fulvous, and Black-billed Tree Ducks,
and no doubt other sedentary Ducks would prove equally suitable
to establish in a completely free state.
Many of our native Ducks will stay on a pond if not disturbed.
At Cleres, a number of Pochards, Tufted Wigeons, Garganeys, and
Teal, whether bred there or wild migrants, have remained for years
on the lake. But about 60 per cent of the young birds disappear in
the first autumn ; this is also true of Falcated, American Wigeons, and
a few other species.
The greatest risk of losing full-winged Ducks is the freezing over
of the water in the winter, and if this can be prevented by
springs or a strong flow, very few birds will go. Otherwise, even
quite well-established birds may leave and usually never return. Inci-
dentally, Flamingoes can never be kept full-winged.
Screamers stay well, and are most interesting, as they roam like
Eagles, and settle on the top of trees.
A very good way of keeping the small Waders, including Gable
Egrets, is to liberate them with a cut wing in the spring ; the feathers

will soon grow again, and the birds stay and fly about during the
summer, migrating in the autumn. A fresh stock can be procured in
the following spring.
Practically all game birds can be liberated and kept full-winged
if the grounds are sufficiently extensive and the vermin kept down.
But it is necessary to train them to stay for six months or a year,
with clipped wings, in fenced enclosures.
Full-winged Parrots are a great attraction to any park or gardens,
especially the larger species which are safe from the attacks of Hawks
and Owls. Macaws are perfect, as they stay well, and with the
exception of the rarer all blue species, do not usually damage trees or
buildings, and are ready to breed at liberty. Their flight is a
wonderful sight, and they are perfectly hardy.
Like other Parrots, it is necessary to keep them on the spot for
about a year, either in an aviary or loose, with a clipped wing, so
that they are well acquainted with the surroundings before they can
fly, otherwise they are apt to get lost on the first days.
The different White Cockatoos stay well, and stand the winters,
but they do a great deal of damage to woodwork, and I never could
keep them free for long on account of this terrible habit, which is*a
great pity. I find, however, that my great Black Palm Cockatoos,
also perfectly indifferent to cold, are harmless, and stay quite well.
Their flight is very peculiar.
All the Galahs are very bad stayers. Amazons, of which I always
keep a few at complete liberty, are quite hardy and stay well.
I shall only say a few words of the smaller Parrots and Parrakeets.
I find that Alexandrian and Eingnecks stay well, but they are very
destructive to fruit. All the American Conures are good stayers ; the
Quaker Parrakeets have done particularly well in different German
Zoos, and I had delightfully tame Eed-headed Conures at liberty
at Cleres. Australian Parrakeets are more difficult, but good results
can be attained with cocks as day-liberty birds. Lord Tavistock has
had a great experience of them all, and desirable information on this
subject will be found in our back numbers, and in his excellent book.
Perhaps he will give us one day an extensive summary of the results
he obtained.

A. Ezra--Successful Rearing of the Blacksmith Plover
The same can be said of Waxbills and Weavers, which he has often
tried. Pekin Robins are disappointing. Red Cardinals do rather well.
Finally, Pigeons and Doves of sedentary habits can well be
established at liberty if there are not too many birds of prey about.
At Cleres they seldom survive the winter as the Brown Owls soon kill
them all after the trees have shed their leaves, which is a great
pity. Otherwise Australian Crested Pigeons, Tigrini, Palm, Senegal,
and different African and Asiatic species prove very satisfactory,
and a number of them can be seen at Woburn and at Foxwarren,
where they are a great attraction. Guinea and Snow Pigeons soon
disappear.
I hope these few hurried lines, an answer to an S 0 S message for
copy from our Editor, may induce more of our members who possess
the necessary room, to try some of the birds mentioned. They will
lose practically none of them, by taking precautions, and add very
much to their pleasure and interest in watching birds at liberty, in full
possession of their natural power of flight. Furthermore, flying birds
are more inclined to nest and to produce fertile eggs.

This attractive looking Plover is a native of East and South Africa,
and as a rule a resident species, but migrant in Natal, where it is only
found during the cold weather. It is never found far from water,
and feeds mostly on the border of swamps and marshy ground, on
worms, insects, and molluscs.
They are often met in small flocks of about a dozen birds, and are
not at all wild. When nesting it will fly at an intruder, and try to
drive him away, making an awful noise all the time. They are par-
ticularly noisy birds, and often frighten and disturb game. The call
is a shrill metallic " Click Click " rather like the sound of the black-
smith's hammer, hence its name. The nest is a shallow depression on

the bare ground, some fifty or a hundred yards from the edge of the
swamp, lined with grass and roots. They lay two to four eggs, which
are pointed at one end, sandy buff, spotted with black. I have had
a pair of these interesting birds for nearly ten years, which were brought
over by Mr. Webb, the well-known collector. All these years they
never attempted to nest, but this spring they started making a nest
between two large stones in one of my large aviaries, which is occupied
by several other birds. The nest consisted of small pieces of bark.
The first egg was laid on the 5th May, and another on the 7th. Colour
of eggs fawn, heavily speckled with dark brown and black.
Two young were hatched on the 8th June. Colour when
hatched was brownish-grey, beak and legs slate grey. When nine
days old the colour of the neck and breast began to turn into a dirty
white. The chicks were fed on ants eggs, and finely chopped meal-
worms for the first ten days, after that whole meal-worms, gentles, ant's
eggs, and stock food were given, and it was noticed that the chicks
preferred the stock food to the meal-worms but the ant's eggs were
first favourites. To protect the birds while sitting, a wire
frame, five feet square was put round them to prevent the other birds
in the aviary from interfering. Both birds took turns in the incubation,
but they always left the nest whenever anyone approached. On the
17th July, when this goes to the Editor, the birds are well grown, and
are assuming the colour of the parents, black and white. I don't
believe this bird has been bred in captivity before.

210 A. Ezra--Nesting and Rearing of the European Hoopoe
Madagascar. They nest in holes in trees and also in walls and crevices
and fill the bottom of the nest with bits of straw and feathers and
excreta, with the result that there is always an offensive odour in
the nest. Five to seven eggs are laid, and sometimes up to ten and
twelve--colour of eggs greenish blue or olive. Incubation by hen only.
Nests from April to June. Feeds on insects and worms. Hoopoes
are rare in England, common in Central and South France.
My friend, Monsieur Plocq, sent me a few of these beautiful birds
which he had hand reared in the Vendee. As they arrived here in
October, it was too late to turn them out in the large aviaries, so
they were left all the winter in a large cage in my bird room. In May
they were turned out in one of my large aviaries. There were six birds
in all, and they soon settled down to their new life with dozens of other
birds in the aviary. One pair soon took charge of a log, which was
in the aviary for Parrakeets. This log was two feet in length, and was
hung about six feet from the ground on a post surrounded by ivy
The entrance to the nest being ten inches from the top of the log,,
and two inches in diameter. The inside of the log was 5J inches in
diameter. On 15th May five eggs were noticed, but the colour could
not be seen properly as it was seventeen inches from the top of the log
to the nest, but they appeared to be white. On 30th May three young
were noticed, covered in down. By 2nd June five young could be
seen. Their beaks were very short and wide, and did not appear to
lengthen until the young were fourteen days old and the feathers were
showing colour. When the young were three weeks old they were
almost as big as their parents, and their plumage also the same.
The old birds were not seen to feed the young for twelve days, after
that time the hen bird began to leave the nest more often, and then
one day three of the old birds were seen taking meal-worms and gentles
to the nest. They did not go right into the nest, but just put their
heads in the entrance hole, so it is not known whether the meal-worms
and gentles were dropped to the young, or whether the young stretched
up for them. The depth from the entrance hole to the nest was
seven inches. The young left the nest on the following dates : First
left the nest on 24th June, another on the 25th, two others on the 27th,
two on the 29th June.

Although the nest was examined every day, no more than five
young ones were seen, and it was not until 27th June that we discovered
that there were six young ones. Four were seen flying about in the
aviary, and there were two in the nest. A continuous supply of meal-
worms, gentles, and small earth worms were given, and as there were
a considerable number of birds in the aviary, the only way of making
sure that only the Hoopoes would be able to get the live food was by
placing it in an oblong tin two inches deep, and covered with half-inch
wire netting.
I may mention that three adult birds out of the six in the aviary
were seen to look after the young. I have now removed the three
adult birds and the six young birds from the large aviary, and have
put all nine in a small aviary which they have to themselves. All
three birds feed the young ones, and at the time of writing (17th July),
one cannot tell the young from the full grown. Although these birds
were bred in captivity in 1911, I thought it would interest members
to have details of the rearing of these lovely birds.

This, to my mind, is the most interesting of the three types of the
Umbrella Bird--the accompanying photograph which is taken from
a museum specimen, shows its remarkable peculiarities.
The male is black above and beneath, with slight metallic reflections
on the back and crest, the whole front of the neck and breast are bare
of feathers, the bill is dark and plumbeous, also the feet are black.
The female is very similar to the male, but the head crest is much
smaller, the ne&amp;lt;?k only slightly denuded, and throat rather small.
This bird which inhabits Costa Kica and Yeragua, was originally
discovered by Worcerniez in the cordillera of Chirqui, at an elevation
of 8,000 feet. The following extract is taken from (Carriker Annals,
Carnegie Museum, vol. vi, No. 1, August, 1909) kindly sent me
by Mr. Kinnear, of the Ornithology Department, the Natural History
Museum, on the habits of this bird :--

P. Lambert--Pheasants in Relation to Aviculture
" This remarkable Cotinga has the most varied range of any species
of the family in Costa Rica, being found from sea-level up to 10,000 feet,
where there are heavy forests. It is not an abundant bird, however,
and but few individuals are seen. I saw a pair on Rio Sicsola, near sea-
level, and secured the female. At Cuacimo I also secured a female, and
close by, at El Hogar, secured a pair in 1907. They are always seen
in the heavy forest, sometimes near the ground and again high up in
the trees, and are very stupid and easy to approach."
I believe none of the three types of this bird have ever been kept
in captivity, and consider that our society should do all that is possible
to save these interesting birds from extinction.
The base of the neck is reddish orange, and the throat wattle red
in life.

The Avicultural Society is in a flourishing condition, and our
numbers are satisfactory. But if one picks up the January issue
and scans the names of those who are genuinely interested in Orna-
mental Pheasants, the Pheasant enthusiast receives rather a rude
shock. I suppose one would be correct in presuming that every member
of the Avicultural Society keeps a few birds, whether they are Parrots,
Parrakeets, Finches, Budgerigars, is immaterial. Yet I am sorry to say
it is true that only comparatively few of these members keep Pheasants.
It is surely very surprising and it is difficult to discover a reason. It
cannot be on the score of space, for Pheasants do not require large
aviaries and in fact most Pheasants live in complete harmony with
other birds. It is not the expense entailed, for many of the Ornamental
Pheasants are not expensive, on the contrary. It cannot be urged that
the breeding results are poor, this would be a terrible calumny, and a
fallacy. Most certainly it cannot be said that Pheasants are lacking
in beautiful plumage, for no group of birds in the world can be more
elaborately or delightfully garbed. Again, it cannot be said that

Pheasants are not hardy, for no birds taken as a whole, are hardier.
So what is the reason for the apparent neglect of these exquisite creations,
and this amongst a people who join an Avicultural Society ? I cannot
provide a satisfactory answer, and yet the subject intrigues me, for
it is so utterly incomprehensible. Here we have a group of birds,
many species of which are on the point of extinction, and we hear
such a great authority as M. Delacour repeatedly telling us that this
is no fairy tale, but a fact, and yet our members do not rally to this
most intriguing branch of aviculture. It is true that we have received
great encouragement during the past twelve months, and many well-
known members of the Society have taken up Pheasants, but still not
as many as we hoped for. Many of our members cannot make the
excuse that the more expensive species are beyond their pockets, and
still knowing as they do that future generations of Pheasant lovers
must depend almost entirely upon our efforts to breed these species,
they still cannot bring themselves to take up one of the most
delightful and satisfying hobbies in the world.
Perhaps members will be surprised to know that I am aware of at
least five working men who keep such rare Pheasants as the Elliot,
Edwards, and Peacock Pheasant, quite likely their accumulated
savings for a whole year have been spent on one such pair, they take a
wonderful pride in these birds, and yet have not bought them purely
from a mercenary point of view. I know of one man whose weekly
earnings are but a paltry 505., and yet this good man is saving his
shillings until he has enough in hand to buy a pair of Edwards. I think
it is wonderful, and we have no idea of the sacrifices that enthusiast
makes, it puts some of us to shame.
I think that those aviculturists who keep rare Parrakeets and other
rare and exotic small birds are doing a great service to aviculture, and
I should be the last to disparage their efforts, but as my interests are
almost entirely devoted to Pheasants, I never tire of urging others
to join the O.P.S., and commence the culture of Ornamental
Pheasants. It is possible to keep in confinement every species of
Pheasant, and moreover to induce them to propagate and surely this
in itself should act as a great incentive. Now for one moment let us
look at their great beauty. What a blaze of colour the Golden cock

possesses, and like most other species, it is extremely hardy and breeds
well in confinement. Take the Lady Amherst cock, not so gaudy as
the Golden, but what glorious beauty, can any bird in the world
compare with this most perfectly conceived bird ? The Chinquis
Peacock Pheasant, a most exquisite little creature, one has only to see

a jewel is hard and dead as compared with this gem of nature. Look
at the Indian Monal, clumsy old fellow he may be, but if we except a
humming bird, what bird in the world has such iridescent beauty ?
Gaze on the cock when he is standing in the full blaze of the sun, catch
the fiery copper bronze of his neck feathers, and if one is not entranced,,
then I must give it up.
Take all the Fireback group of Pheasants, there are many distinct
species, and yet each has a distinctive beauty, perhaps the most
beautiful of all is the Bornean of that ilk, stately, charming, and so
proud, aware of its beauty and showing it always to the best advantage.
That most lovely Tragopan Pheasant, here again we have at least
five species, but gaze on the beauty of the Satyr cock. What a marvellous,
blend of colour ; has anyone seen such an exquisite carmine, imagine
him in his mating attire, and watch his wonderful bib slowly distend
until it covers nearly the whole of his breast, then we see a gorgeous
purple with vivid stripes of scarlet. The cock would seem a fearsome
creature when displaying, but he is the most gentle and tame of all
Pheasants, and also the most lovable.
A few more, and I must finish, but I must mention the Swinhoe
cock, majestic and so emphatically masterful, its plumage is a perfect
example of the wonderful designs of beauty in nature. Perhaps the
most striking feature of a lovely ensemble is the strange white mantle
that would appear to accentuate the rest of its metallic plumage. Just
one more, who could pass a Reeves cock without an exclamation of
delight; buff, amber, yellow, white, and brown, this cock is most
peculiarly marked, and to make him still more peculiar, just gaze on
his five-foot tail. No, I must just mention one more Pheasant, for the
Edwards Pheasant makes a greater appeal to many than the more gaily
garbed specimens. His plumage calls to mind that material which is y

I believe, called " shot silk ", of a purplish blue, it scintillates and
appears to vibrate in the rays of the sun.
The other day I was at Mr. Blay's garden party, and we were looking
round his Pheasant aviaries. We had seen most of his Pheasants,
and came to two Edwards cocks. I overheard a lady remark, " Do you
mean to say that is a Pheasant; why it is the most beautiful creature
I have ever seen." Although that remark was not intended for me,
I flushed with pleasure, for I always maintain that the Edwards cock
is one of the Great Creator's most wonderful creations. I always
maintain that it is hopelessly impossible to describe a beautiful bird,
and not having the descriptive powers of a Porter, a Delacour, or a
Goodfellow, I make apologies for even making an attempt to describe
a few features.
But I do wish to appeal to lovers of birds from a more laudable
point of view than mere beauty, for many of these exquisite birds
are on the point of extinction, and unless great and determined efforts
are forthcoming in the near future, then they will be lost for all time.
Can we think of such a sad and catastrophic disaster. The great
aviculturist M. Delacour is doing a wonderful work in preserving
some of these species for all times, but he wants the hearty co-operation
of hundreds of others. If we could only induce a sufficient number of
enthusiasts to join the O.P.S., we could in a few years obtain a sufficient
number of these Pheasants to make many species safe from final
extinction. We must have new blood in many species, and this cannot
be attained without active support. Don't think for one moment
that I am suggesting that any member of this Society who joins the
O.P.S. will be required to put down a lump sum, such is not the case.
We want a sufficient number of interested members to combine together
and arrange for the importation of such rare species as the Chinese
Monal, many of the Firebacks, the Blue Crossoptilon, the Edwards,
the Bulwer, and other rare species, so what can be done about it ?
Surely it must be heartbreaking to M. Delacour to note that at present
but few of us appear to take a serious view of the situation, merely
a handful! We Britishers are renowned for our true love of birds,
and are we going to allow these Pheasants to become unknown to future
generations ? What will they think of us, if visiting the British Museum,

they see a gorgeous Pheasant that has become extinct, and now only
to be viewed in a glass case ? What will they think of this generation
of aviculturists ? The O.P.S. is, I can assure you, doing a wonderful
work, and already plans are on foot to obtain many rare Pheasants.
In fact, some will be almost on their way when these notes are printed.
But the O.P.S. wants the co-operation of the great majority of the
members of this Avicultural Society. Many of you have the leisure
time to devote to the keeping and rearing of rare Pheasants. So I am
now making a most fervent and genuine appeal to you to join the
O.P.S. I would not suggest that fanciers who have never kept a
Pheasant before should immediately embark on the rare species ; it
would be advisable to make a start with some of the commoner species
such as Goldens, Silvers, Beeves, or Amhersts. By doing so they
would very soon learn to love them very much, and become imbued
with a desire to possess the rarer species. During the next three or
four years we simply must make a tremendous effort. At the moment
we have over 220 members of the O.P.S., and this is indeed most
satisfactory.
Now, if my appeal has the slightest effect on the readers of these
notes, readers who are members of the greatest avicultural Society in
the world, may I ask such fanciers to join the O.P.S. We want the
Avicultural Society and the O.P.S. to become a powerful force, and we
want to go hand in hand to help M. Delacour in a work which I can
truthfully say he has devoted the best years of his life to accomplish,
viz. to be able to say in ten years time, " The Bulwer, the Temminck
Tragopan, the Blue Crossoptilon, the Peacock Pheasants, the Mikado,
and many others, are now safe from extinction." Every member of
the Avicultural Society can help to make this ideal come true. I shall
not rest content until almost every member has joined the O.P.S.,
and then we shall rapidly see going forward one of the greatest schemes
ever known to the avicultural world, namely, the saving of these many
species of most lovely Pheasants, not merely for the present generation
to enjoy, but for our children, nay more, for our children's children's
children.
Our Secretary of the O.P.S., and what a worthy Secretary she is,
lives at Wellesbourne, Warwick, and the subscription to the O.P.S.
is a modest 65 . per annum. So please !

Since last I reported concerning the use of dependable foster parents
for various kinds of foreign Doves, I have experimented considerably
with Ring-neck, White, and California Mourning Doves. Though I
know personally a number of Dove breeders who have had good success
with Ring-neck and White Doves, the pairs I tried would invariably
let their adopted young starve, once these had left the nest.
Fortunately, I was able last year to procure a number of pairs of
the California Mourning Dove, which since then I have used exclusively
for raising certain foreign Doves. In no case, so far at least, have
these doves failed to continue to feed their adopted young until they
were fully ready to shift for themselves---surely, a noteworthy record.
All this despite the fact that both colour and general appearance of
some of the adopted offspring differ decidedly from those of the young
of the Mourning Dove. Moreover, whereas certain breeds of Doves are
extremely shy, especially during the breeding season, the Mourning
Doves are quite gentle. They will, as a matter of fact, not leave the
nest regardless of how closely I approach, so that if I wish to examine
its contents, I have to lift the closely sitting bird off. California
Mourning Doves will incubate successfully any eggs of a size similar
to their own, and raise the squabs of any Dove similar in size to their
own squabs. Their use as foster parents this year has enabled me to
raise to maturity many more young Doves than heretofore. Moreover,
since many breeds of foreign Doves seem to possess an unlimited
capacity for laying eggs, which frequently they refuse for some reason
or other to incubate, it is a comparatively simple matter to save the
majority of these eggs by placing them in the nests of Mourning Doves.
Strangely, I have not found that the length of time which eggs have
been incubated is an important factor in getting them promptly
hatched by foster parents and the young birds raised. In other words,
I have placed eggs ready to hatch within three or four days under
Mourning Doves that had been sitting but a short time. They accepted
readily, the considerably shortened period of incubation, dis-
charging their new duties satisfactorily.

Carl Naether--Concerning Foreign Doves
Even though it has been my wish for a long time to raise some
Cape Doves, I was not successful until I placed their eggs under Diamond
Doves which, being usually excellent feeders, raised the young Cape
Doves as willingly and well as if they had been their own flesh and
blood. From now on I shall use the Diamond Doves to help raise
other small Doves of the rarer varieties.
Almost every summer I am considerably troubled by gopher snakes
and lizards, which can do tremendous damage in a bird house in a very
short time. Thus, on going through my aviaries yesterday, I was
surprised to find the female Cape Dove ofl the nest. Immediate inspec-
tion of it disclosed no trace of the eggs ; several Finches' nests had
likewise been robbed of their contents. My search for the culprit
was soon rewarded ; hidden in brush I came upon a two-foot gopher
snake which was eyeing me curiously. Certain--largely distended--por-
tions of its writhing body proved to me that the reptile had devoured
the dozen or more eggs but a short while before. I soon caught it.
If gopher snakes come upon fairly good-sized squabs, like those
of Bronze-wings last year, which they cannot swallow, they will strangle
them anyhow. I presume the proximity of many poultry establish-
ments in this vicinity attracts the gopher snakes, for they are known
to be excellent mousers, and generally quite useful and harmless.
This season I seem to have exceptionally good luck with a pair of
Australian Crested Doves. At this time of writing they have raised five
youngsters, and have two more in the nest. This is an exceptionally
good record, for this particular pair, in view of the fact that last year
they invariably left their young to die of starvation. The only change
which I have made in their care consists of the addition of fresh lettuce
and some bread to their daily menu, which they relish greatly. Meal-
worms they refuse consistently. The giving of this bit of soft food seems
to be responsible for the sudden change in their behaviour. Whereas
the birds, when on a straight seed diet, were frequently restless and
discontented, as if they lacked something, they are now quite content
and have, as stated before, become excellent feeders of their young.
Next to the Australian Crested Dove, the Indian Greenwing is a
delightfully dependable breeder and feeder. Its only fault is its great
.shyness, which prompts the bird to leave its nest so suddenly as often

to dislodge and break the eggs. As a faithful feeder of its young, the
Indian Greenwing, in my experience at least, is unsurpassed. However,
I have learned long since to be careful before generalizing regarding the
behaviour of Doves, or birds in general. The fact that one pair of
a certain breed of Dove does well by no means implies that other pairs
of this breed, even if kept under similar conditions, will do equally,
or even nearly as, well. All of which means that if you are so fortunate
as to have a good breeding pair of a more or less rare kind of foreign
Dove, you should by all means not dispose of it at any price, since it
may be months, even years, before you may be able to obtain as
desirable a pair.
The longer I breed foreign Doves, the more I become convinced
that one of their most needful requirements is privacy, especially
during nesting time. Whereas heretofore I have used largely small
and individual pens, I have found this year's addition of a medium-sized
aviary, planted with a fairly large cherry tree and various evergreen
shrubs, a decided improvement. Not only has this little sanctuary
a much more natural and pleasing appearance, but the Doves actually
thrive in it, as shown by their increasingly successful breeding activities.
Best of all, they now have the seclusion which seems so indispensable
to their continued well-being and happiness. Several pairs of Diamond
Doves have virtually taken possession of the cherry tree, in the pro-
tecting branches of which they have built extremely neat and sub-
stantial nests. They, as well as the various other kinds of Doves in this
aviary, are no longer interested in artificial nesting sites.
O.P.S.
The members of the O.P.S. were entertained at a garden party
at Mr. Blay's house at Surbiton on 4th July. The garden party was
preceded by a general meeting and still prior to this the committee
were invited to lunch with our President. All those present had a most
enjoyable afternoon. The general meeting was a most enthusiastic one,

fine address by Dr. Derscheid of Belgium. In a few delightfully spoken
words he expressed the opinion that the Society had a great responsi-
bility and were facing this in a most remarkable manner. He thought
that we had achieved in one year what would have been good for three,
but we had some problems to tackle that would tax us to the utmost.
There was one thing he would like to emphasize, he referred to the
poor stock of Amhersts in this country, in the year that the Society
had been functioning a wonderful improvement had been affected, but
there was still much to be done. He also thought that members did
not appreciate the beauty of many pheasants, such as the group of
Kaleeges.
The meeting was so pleased with his remarks that he was elected
a member of the Committee on the spot. Much humour was introduced
into the meeting by sallies between our President who incidentally
was in the chair and Mr. P. J. Lambert, the latter was inclined to wander
from the agenda, and was repeatedly called to order.
Personally, I have a suspicion that this was done to create a happy
feeling amongst members, anyway it caused amusement. Members
were shown round Mr. Blay's extensive aviaries, and we were all delighted
with his magnificent collection of pheasants, waterfowl, and other
birds.
Mr. Blay has an aviary which must be the largest aviary in the world.
The garden party was a great success, tables and chairs set out on the
lawn of the Manor House just above the lake, every member thoroughly
enjoying the hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Blay, it was really a delightful
afternoon, I have often expressed my thanks to Mr. Blay for his wonder-
ful efforts to help the Society, it does seem as if he cannot do enough
for us, this last effort is a crowning effort, and may we hope the crown
will ultimately be studded with diamonds !

EGG-COLLECTING--TAKING THE WHOLE

One of our members has written calling the attention of the
Avicultural Society to a notice in The Times of an exhibit by Mr.
Edgar P. Chance, of 130 glass-covered cabinets filled with eggs of
British birds. The collection represents 180 species out of the 200
which breed in the British Isles, and contains about 20,000 eggs.
Mr. Chance appropriates the whole clutch, not merely an egg or two
from each nest, as he believes that if less than the whole clutch is taken
the bird either deserts or else hatches the remaining eggs, thereby
reducing her normal brood. By taking the full number he contends
that the bird is merely caused to repeat, usually the same number,
and in a new nest, at an interval of from eight to eighteen days, according
to species. " Thus a collection, even so large as this one," he states,
" is made without any reduction of our bird population."
Mr. Chance also declares that he has made no attempt to take the
eggs of every British breeding species, and has declined opportunities

to do so in the case of those in need of special protection. Though if
his first statement is correct that " the bird population suffers no
diminution " through wholesale collecting, it is difficult to understand
why he stayed his hand. Mr. Chance has pursued his investigations
to the point of taking as many as three clutches laid in the same season
by the same birds. According to him, only the expert egg-collector
finds the nests of rare birds, and he (naturally !) looks for them only
at the appropriate time. Therefore the repeat layings protect the
bird from further disturbance except, of course, if followed up, and this
would never be done by any reputable collector " to the detriment
of the species ". Mr. Chance does not explain how a second " reputable
collector " who chances on a nest containing a " repeat clutch " knows
that it is a repeat clutch, and therefore taboo. He also may wish to
ascertain how often a bird can be robbed without detriment to the
species.
The article from which I have quoted says that " not everyone
will accept Mr. Chance's reassurances ", and with this most members
of the Avicultural Society will agree.

Madam, --I enclose two photographs which may be of interest to
the Avicultural Magazine. Blue and Lesser Snow Geese are often spoken
of as variations one of another. After hatching and rearing both I find
Lesser Snow's period of incubation to be 24 days and Blue Snow's 26. Blue
Snow from the day of hatching grazed on young grass, clover, etc., like young
Greyleg, this being a sufficient and proper food for them, but Lesser Snow
for the first three or four days look for and depend on fly and then come
on to graze like other goslings. This may be helpful to those who wish to
rear young of either species.

Madam,-- The recognized value of Bengalese as foster-parents for other

this way.
In my experience there is considerable variation in this respect, and it is
in the hope that others will do likewise, and thus provide useful information
for our mutual benefit, that I give below a list of the species I have, so far,
reared with Bengalese, and the results in each case. I shall be interested to
know if the experience of other aviculturists agrees with mine in regard to the
species mentioned.

Madam, --I thought our members might be interested in the breeding of
White-eared Persian Bulbuls. Last year I had a pair in an open garden aviary
and succeeded in breeding and rearing three young birds. This was their second
attempt--the first proving unsuccessful because I had other insectiverous
birds in the same enclosure. These I removed, the Bulbuls went to nest again
hatching three out of four eggs. This year I have the pair in a separate enclosure
about 5 ft. by 10 ft. by 6 ft. high. Their first nest contained three eggs which
were hatched, but during a severe storm last month two youngsters died--
the third is now flying about with the parents and is in fine condition.
Last year I was told that my success with these birds was only the fourth
recorded occasion on which they had been bred in Europe.
I may say that contrary to certain belief I find these birds perfectly hardy
and though I brought them indoors last winter do not intend to do so this year
as I feel quite certain (from experience of other pairs) that even on the north
east coast they will survive a winter out of doors in a good though unheated
aviary.

THE LIDTH'S JAY

This beautiful Jay is undoubtedly a relative of the common Jay
of Europe and Asia. It differs in several striking points ; being a larger,
darker, and brighter bird. It has the peculiar habit of nesting in holes
in trees, whereas the common Jays build a cup-shaped nest on branches.
However, its general shape is that of the true Garrulus of which it
also has the blue feathers barred with black on the wings, both characters
showing well its real affinities. The white streaks on the throat seem
also to link it with the Himalayan Lanceolated Jay (Garrulus lanceolatus).
Both sexes are alike but the young birds are browner than the adults,
the whole head being blackish brown, and they have no white spots
on the wings and tails. It is said that these white marks are only
acquired in the second year.
Lidth's Jays are only to be found on the two larger islands of the
northern group of the Riu-Kiu Archipelago, which lies between Japan
and Formosa, Amami-Oshima, and Tokunoshima. Having such a re-
stricted habitat (each of these islands is slightly larger than the Isle of
Wight) these birds have always been very rare in European living collec-
tions. Formerly, they were common on the two islands, but feather hunters
reduced them to the verge of extinction. Fortunately, full protection

lias been extended to them by the Japanese Government during the
last twenty years, and they are recovering satisfactorily in numbers.
Of course they can only be obtained at rare intervals, and by special
official permission, for European Aviaries. The climate of the northern
Biu-Kiu Islands is only sub-tropical, and Lidth's Jays are quite hardy
in sheltered avairies. It has never been bred in captivity.
I have had eight of these gorgeous birds in my aviaries for the last
seven years and they have done splendidly. They become very tame,
and when in full colour in the summer they are very beautiful. Last
year I had a pair of them in one of my small aviaries by themselves.
They built a beautiful nest in a nest-box similar to a Parrakeet's, and
laid three clutches of eggs, but all these were eaten up by the birds.
I mean to try them again this year, and I hope with better results.
The coloured picture gives you a good idea of the beauty of this wonderful
Jay. I think he is by a long way the most beautiful of all Jays.
From Prince Nobrisuke Taka-Tsukasa
(.Lalocitta lidthi (Bonaparte))
Distribution. --This Jay occurs in Amami-Oshima and Tokuno-
shima, which are in the northern group of Byukyu Islands, and it
has not yet been known from other islands.
Habits. --It is fierce in nature and often attacks other birds and
destroys their nests and eggs. As this Jay keeps almost exclusively
to the thickly wooded mountain-ranges, on these islands, no birds
other than this species is found in those districts.
It feeds on acorns and insects, but it takes a small quantity of
the latter and, according to the peasants who live in the mountains,
it also eats immature bulbous roots and stems of sweet potatoes, but
its staple food is the acorn of Quercus cuspidata, and its distribution
corresponds to that of Quercus cuspidata occurring in these islands.
It is very active and lives in flocks of some half dozen birds in
dense forests and, like the Jay, it is also very noisy. When a man comes
near them they instantly fly away with a warning cry, and it is rather
difficult to shoot them, but if a hunter uses a pipe which is made of
a stem of Miscanthus sinensis by bending it into two and puts some

blades of this grass in it, then the Jays will gather around him and
they never fly away though they hear the sound of a gun.
The flesh of this Jay is not good to eat, but its feathers are beautiful,
and there was once a great demand for them as ornamental plumes,
but now it is protected by law as a natural monument throughout the
year. Unlike other Jays, it generally builds its nest in the hollow of
a tree, lined with leaves of Quercus cuspidata and plantains, but it is
said that on rare occasion it makes its nest like other Jays or uses
other birds' nests. A clutch of eggs numbers three to five, but mostly
five. The ground-colour is pale greenish blue, generally with no
markings, rarely with small pale yellowish-brown spots. The breeding
season is from the middle of February to the latter part of March.
Captivity .*--In Japan it is very easy to keep in captivity ; it feeds
on common Japanese soft food, and if a small quantity of meat is
given to the bird it will appreciate it. Like other Jays it imitates
little bits of the bird's song and will become attached to its owner.
A great drawback of this bird as a cage bird is that it bites the bark
of trees and kills the plants in the aviary. Although I have not yet
succeeded in breeding this bird, I do not think it would be difficult;

By J. Delacour
No order of birds is more popular than the Duck tribe, which
also includes Swans, Geese, and the different groups of birds related
to them. All are conspicuous game-birds, which always have attracted
sportsmen's attention. Most of them are handsome and highly
ornamental, so that they are a wonderful ornament to water, whether
it be a stream, a pond, or a lake. Furthermore, they are much inclined
to breed in confinement, semi or full liberty. It is not therefore to be
wondered at if they are widely kept and bred. There are some large
private collections in England, in America, in Holland, and in France,
and hundreds of smaller ones. Several breeders make a regular living
out of their birds. Of public gardens, the Berlin Zoo certainly shows
the finest collection of Waterfowl, those of other similar establishments

J. Delacour--Notes on Waterfowl
in the world being rather indifferent and often made up of local
species ; such is unfortunately the case in the London and Paris
Zoos, mostly owing to lack of suitable room. The lakes in St. James'
Park and Kew Gardens have nice collections.
At Cleres, I have for many years kept some hundreds of Waterfowl,
and now I am lucky enough to possess nearly 120 species of these
fine birds, although I do not keep the very common and bulky sorts,
such as the Mute, Whooper, and other large Swans, Canadian, White-
fronted, Greylag, Bean, Pink-footed, and Spurwinged Geese.
I have often written about my Waterfowl, their accommodation,
and our breeding results in this Magazine. To-day, I want to say a
few words on the rarer or newly introduced species. During the last
ten or twelve years, quite a number of interesting species, which we
had very seldom or never seen in captivity before, have been imported
and many of these bred and established. Birds which had for years
been greatly desired are now numerous on our waters. I cannot help
thinking that if our late president, Hubert Astley, whose bright
intelligence and keenness were for many years the spirit of our Society,
could come back to life, after eleven years, he would hardly believe
what he would see. So many hours had we spent together looking
at plates or skins of birds and making plans to obtain them some
day, without much hope that we could ever succeed ! Waterfowl,
of which both of us were very fond, often called our attention.
Among the Mallards, three species have now been well established :
the Japanese Spotbill ( Anas zonorhyncha), which also inhabits China ;
Meller's Duck (A. melleri), from Madagascar, and the Florida Duck
(A. fulvigula). The first-named is quite handsome, and let us say
here, not very closely related to the long-introduced Indian Spotbill
(A. poecilorhyncha) being nearer to the Australian A. superciliosa,
I believe. The other two are not very bright in plumage. But all
three are interesting and decidedly useful acquisitions, as they breed
abundantly and are very good stayers in a full-winged condition.
They prove most suitable to stock waters for shooting ; their flesh
is excellent eating.
Some years ago I possessed a female of the very rare Madagascar
Bernier's Teal (A. bernieri), very much a smaller, lighter, and redder

edition of a female Chestnut-breasted Teal, with reddish bill and legs.
It proved hardy and lived several years, but never could be paired up,
as no specimens ever came before or after. It is very scarce and local
indeed in its native island, being confined to a small area in the west.
At last the African Red-billed Pintail {A. erythrorhyncha) seems to
be well established. It is a pretty duck, reminding one of the Bahama
Pintail, but greyer. The lovely Versicolor Teal (A. versicolor) from
the Argentine, which had disappeared from live collections for a long
time, has been reimported during the last three years, and in 1935
and 1936 I have bred a good many ; they are quite easy to rear.
Hottentot Teal (A. punctata), from Africa and Madagascar, have been
brought over in fair numbers in 1929 and 1935 by Mr. C. S. Webb,
and it is to be hoped that this tiny and beautiful species will also be
estpblished, though it has not yet nested in captivity. But a drake on
Mr. Ezra's pond crossed with a Carolina Duck, which reared two
hybrids, looking quite intermediate between the parents ; they
disappeared after a couple of years, being full-winged.
Two rare Shovellers have been introduced : the Red Shoveller
(A. platalea) from the Argentine, a pretty species now well established,
and the New Zealand Shoveller (A. rhynchotis), brought ovet by
Mr. Sydney Porter, who entrusted me with one drake and two ducks
a few have been bred last year and one again this year. They are
difficult to rear.
If we now turn to the true Geese, we are glad to say that, thanks*
to the Duke of Bedford, the lovely Red-breasted Goose ( Branta
ruficollis) is now well acclimatized ; a number are bred annually at
Woburn. The same thing can be said of the pretty Emperor Goose
(Anser canagica), which now breeds regularly with me.
The rarer American Geese, White-cheeked (. Branta occidentalis)
Hutchin's (B. leucopareia), and Cackling ( B . minima ), are regularly
bred in captivity in America, and some have found their way into
Europe, while Wild Chinese Geese (Cygnopsis cygnoides), fine birds,
totally different from the ugly, domesticated breed, are in Messrs.
Stevens' and my own possession.
Unfortunately, the almost extinct Sandwich Island Goose ( B.
sandvicensis) has disappeared from European collections, as also the.
curious African Black Duck ( Anas sparsa).

J. Delacour--Notes on Waterfowl
The Abyssinian Blue-winged Goose ( Cyanochen cyanopterus), intro-
duced only a few years ago, long a tremendous rarity, is now breeding
freely here and at Walcot, while the fine Andean Goose (Chloephaga
melanoptera) has big broods every year at Cleres.
Just after the War, there were only two Sheldrakes in living col-
lections : the Common and the Ruddy. Soon after, a few Paradise
Sheldrakes were imported from New Zealand ; they are now wide-
spread and breed commonly. The South African Sheldrake ( C . cana),
which had never done well before and was considered very rare, has
been bred for the last eight years, and is now well established.
Curiously enough, the Australian Sheldrake (C. tadornoides), of which
there are quite a few pairs here, at Walcot, and elsewhere, has not
started nesting yet, and its first breeding has still to be achieved.
It is a beautiful species, and not nearly so bad-tempered as the other
three Casarca.
But the best acquisition was that of the Radjah Sheldrake ( Radjah
radjah). Mine came from the Aru Islands, and belong to the smaller
and darker form (R. r. radjah), while those of Messrs. Stevens are
from Melville Island, and therefore larger and browner ( R . r. rufi-
tergum). Pure Radjahs have not yet nested in captivity, but I have
bred several times hybrids from a male Radjah and a female Ruddy
Sheldrake. From a female hybrid and another Radjah drake, I have
this year three-quarter bred birds, looking much like Radjahs, but with
a broader pectoral band, interrupted in the middle, and a slightly
reddish wash on the sides.
The South American Comb Duck, once a rarity, has been lately
often imported, but has not nested yet.
This year, a good many pairs of the White-winged Wood Duck
(Asarcornis scutalata) have arrived. Those owned by Mr. Ezra for
three years have not bred yet, but they ought to do so as easily as
their close allies, the Wild Muscovies of South America. Their African
counterpart, Hartlaub's Duck ( Pteronetta hartlaubi), would be a most
desirable acquisition. As far as I know, only one female has as yet
reached Europe alive, in 1930 about, and lived for two years in the
Paris Zoo. The curious Australian Magpie Geese ( Anseranas semipal-
mata) now numerous enough in collections, have never yet bred in
captivity.

Out of eggs sent from Iceland and other northern countries, some
sea-ducks have been reared during these last years, mostly by Messrs.
Stevens, Moody, McLean, and Wormald: Harlequins, Long-tails,
Barrow's and Common Golden-eyes, Scoters, Eiders, Goosanders,
Mergansers and Smews, while in America, Mr. Sibley breeds Buffle-
heads, American Golden-eyes, Ruddy Ducks and Ring-neck Scaup,
some of which have found their way to England and to France.
Among the Pochards, we have now numbers of Madagascan White-
eyes {Nyroca innotata), quite well established, and Mr. Ezra has bred
repeatedly the curious White-backed Duck ( Thalassornis leuconota).
Baer's Pochard remains a great rarity, but the American Lesser Scaup
(Nyroca affinis) breeds well with us. Messrs. Stevens and myself now
have pairs of the interesting Southern Pochard, from Africa and
South America, a bird closely related to the Red-crested Pochard and
the Rosy-bill; it has not yet been bred in Europe.
The extraordinary Steamer-Duck ( Tachyeres ), from the Straits of
Magellan, and the neighbouring coasts and islands, has been brought
over a few times. It is a dangerous bird to other ducks, clumsy, but
tame and fascinating. A pair I kept for several years on mash and
a little meat, mated and built a nest every year, but no eggs were
ever found.
Mr. Webb has brought us from Madagascar the lovely Pigmy
Goose ( Nettapus auritus), perhaps the prettiest of all ducks. My four
pairs are kept full-winged in an aviary, with fast-running water that
never freezes ; they proved to be quite hardy, just like their Asiatic
cousin, the Cotton Teal, which comes now and then, but is a bad
traveller. It remains to breed both species in captivity. Mr. Good-
fellow landed last year one specimen of the pretty Australian species
(N. pulchellus), but it unfortunately died after a few days in England.
There are still a few Trumpeter Swans at Woburn and at Goilust,
in Holland, but none have been reared for the last two years.
Black-necked Swans breed regularly here and elsewhere. The
opposite photograph shows a pair of imported birds which, since 1922,
have nested every year at Cleres. More than all other Swans, they
have a pretty way of carrying their chicks on their back, under the
wings.

J. Delacour--Notes on Waterfowl
I have kept the Tree Ducks (Dendrocygna) for the last. They
are such peculiar birds that they show no particular relationship
to any other ducks. I am pleased to say that the nine existing species
are now all represented in my collection. Of the four commoner
sorts : White-faced (D. viduata), Grey-breasted (D. discolor), Whistling
(D. javanica), and Wandering (D. arcuata), only the first-named has
often nested here, but not for the last two or three years. But Fulvous
(D.fulva) and Black-billed ( D . arborea) breed very freely and regularly,
as also a pair of the rare and pretty Bed-billed (D . autumnalis) which
differ from the commoner Grey-breasted in having the entire breast
and under parts mahogany red. The two rarest and prettiest have
not so far nested in captivity : the Plumed, or Eyton's, Tree Duck
( D . eytoni), a curious and beautiful Australian species, and the Spotted
(D. guttata), a handsome small bird from New Guinea, three pairs
of which were brought to me last year by Mr. Frost. The latter
have wintered out of doors and proved hardy enough, as long as the
water is free from ice ; I keep them full-winged in an aviary built
over a running stream ; alone of their genus they make a loud
noise on the wing, as the air passes through their quills. They roost
high up at night.
I have tried to keep full-winged most species of Tree-ducks, and
found them very good stayers. I only lost a few which went during
a very cold dry winter, when most of the water was frozen over. They
disliked it, and wandered away.
The list of the species of Waterfowl whose acclimatization is desirable
is not as long now as it used to be. All the same, the following still
have to be imported or established : Hawaiian Goose (A. sandvicensis),

When the first frosts of autumn lay low the late summer flowers
and white mists hide the morning landscape and the last brown leaves
are trodden into the sodden paths and roadways, one's thoughts turn
to warmer and brighter lands where the trees are always green and
flowers always bloom.
Some of us, blessed or cursed, as one may think, with the spirit
of the wanderlust, find no romance in the glow of the firelight on
the chilly winter evenings and instead of getting out our skis and
skates, we pack our bags, steal down to that gateway of the world,
the Docks of London, and there, with no tears, waving handkerchiefs,

or trailing streamers, slip unobtrusively away on some old " tramp "
steamer to far distant lands. To leave thus without fond farewells
or fuss is best, for it seems only that we say au revoir to the grimy
old city instead of " adieu ", and in so many months or years we
steal back again and slip once more into the every-day round with
just a memory that seems like some far away happy dream.
The first part of this chapter opens in Penang, that fascinating
island which is the first stepping-stone to the Far East. To the newcomer
it satisfies all the mental pictures that one has conjured up about the
Orient. The writer had travelled thence by " intermediate steamer "
which is a polite name for a cargo boat or " tramp " on which there
are few passengers ; on these " lines " there are usually few if any
women or children to disturb one for " just a look at your pretty
dickey birds ", there are no cocktail parties, or endless rounds of deck
sports or bridge parties to distract one's attention from one's feathered
charges. Only those who have had to get up at 6 a.m. after a cocktail
party the night before to start attending to one's birds know what
a relief it is to be on a ship where there are no such distractions or
temptations.
The object of this trip was to see something of Northern China
and Manchukuo, and not in any way a bird-collecting trip, in fact
I was told " to bring no more birds home, the place is full of them
now ", but unknown to the family I did manage to sneak in a few
cage fronts, and a little " soft-food, just in case ! Quite why I went
to such God-forsaken places as North China and Manchukuo in the
winter time I don't know, I suppose the papers must have fired my
imagination with their stories of wars and bandits, etc. ; but I thoroughly
repented my folly later on.
On the first day in Penang my friend, a resident in Malaya of
many years standing and who spoke Malay fluently, and I, paid a
visit to the bird market, not so much with the object of purchasing
any birds but just to have a look round, for Penang was but the first
of many places to be visited in the course of four or five months of
leisurely drifting about the Far East. But it is as bad as putting a
monkey into a fruit store and expecting it not to touch anything as
to put an aviculturist into an Eastern bird market and expect him

not to buy ! Our first call was in the bird market proper wliicli com-
paratively speaking was fairly clean and orderly compared to most
of the places I saw later on. In fact there was not nearly so much dirt
and smell as in many English bird shops. Nearly all the cages stood
on legs and the bottoms were of wire netting, the droppings which fell
through were frequently hosed and washed away during the day.
True, many of the cages were terribly overcrowded, but the birds
seemed fairly tame and not at all frightened by all the noise and bustle.
The principal birds on sale were the two species of doves seen in
almost every bird shop in the East, the small and rather beautiful
Barred Dove ( Geopelia striata) and the larger Malayan Spotted Dove
(Streptopelia chinensis tigrina ). One sees simply hundreds of these
wretched birds crowded into terribly inadequate cages, in fact one
would think that they would be almost suffocated. These birds are
in great demand by the Malayans and I think also by the Chinese
who spend hours studying a cage full before they buy one. In Chasen's
book, The Birds of Singapore Island, he says, " The Malays purchase
them for a few cents apiece and carefully regard the legs before buying
a bird. Sometimes a prospective buyer may be seen staring intently
into a wire-fronted cage containing scores of these poor little wretches,
and after quite a long time solemnly point out a huddled-up bird in
the far corner of the cage. The inference being that he had studied
the scales on the toes and decided that the bird is a " lucky " one.
Some numbers are lucky, others unlucky, but we have been singularly
unsuccessful in getting Malays to agree on the point, and although
we picked out the older men to interrogate they seemed curiously
at variance as to the amount of the lucky number. . . .Not only is
the number of scales on the toes regarded as of great importance,
but the Malays are very exacting as to the quality of the 6 coo
The bird itself is supposed to protect the house against evil
influences and fire and the owner often demonstrates his affection
for his pet by taking it out with him, cage and all, when he goes for
a walk.
The little Barred Dove is the most commonly kept bird in Malaya,
a large percentage of the houses in the country have a cage or two
containing these doves. The cages exhibit an extraordinary diversity

in design, from tiny bamboo cages the shape of a compressed sphere
they range to very elaborate structures. One which belonged to a
Malay syce in Johore where I stayed for some time, resembled nothing
more than a miniature " roundabout ", which one sees at fairs. It
was an incredible piece of work and defies description, it had a lace
cover as nearly all the dove's cages have in Malaya, it had platforms,
bays, niches, etc. : was decorated with flags, beads, pictures, artificial
flowers, highly coloured tumblers full of brightly coloured rice, and
altogether was the quaintest contraption I have ever seen. Malay
cages are amazing in the variety of their design and also their utter
inconvenience. In most cases it appears that the cage is simply built
around the bird, there being no door or opening other than between
the bamboo lathes, wdien once the bird is in, it just " stays put
Chinese cages, on the other hand, are models of convenience and the
acme of cage-maker's art.
To get back to the doves, the price asked for them in Penang is
15 (Straits) cents, which is less than 4 \d. apiece. There must have
been thousands of these birds in the markets in Penang, certainly
more than anywhere else I went to. One sees a great many of both
species of doves in the outskirts of Penang where they rise continually
from under one's feet on any uncultivated piece of ground.
Another bird which is very plentiful in the markets is the Malayan
Grackle or Greater Javanese Hill Mynah (Gracula javana). I can never
understand why these birds are called either Grackles or Mynahs,,
they appear to be no relation to either. I was told that these birds
were imported from Java. There were literally hundreds of them
in huge flat chicken crates about a foot high with no perches and
with coarse wire bottoms. Those who know the amount of excrement
which one of these birds passes in a day will realize that this was the
best way of keeping them and preventing each bird fouling the other.
All seemed to be in perfect condition and very tame, the reason for
this is because most of the birds have been hand-reared. One dealer
had thousands of them and the price was about 60 cents or Is. 6 d. each.
The most remarkable bird I have ever possessed was one of this
species. I acquired it on my return journey from the Far East when
I was staying on a remote rubber estate in Johore. We could only

get to the manager's bungalow by a trolley which was pushed on
rails by a native boy, the ground being too swampy to allow a road
to be built. It was at the Chinese store at the end of the trolley line
that I first made the acquaintance of " Tuang-ku ", who, in spite of the
name, which means " sultan ", I think was a female. This bird was
remarkable not on account of its rarity or anything like that, but on
account of its linguistic accomplishments, which were really incredible
not to say rather uncanny. It spoke three languages, Malay and Chinese
fluently, English only occasionally. There was a rumour that the
bird once belonged to a sultan in the islands and that it had been
stolen, taken to Singapore, and sold in one of the bird shops. It also
imitated all manner of noises, a Chinese flute, a motor horn, the
screeching of motor-car brakes, the silly giggle of a Chinese " flapper ".
It said the word " Tuang-ku " in at least six different voices with
an entirely different intonation. It held long conversations in the
voices of several different people, particularly those of an old woman,
a man, and a child, in fact many times I used to think that a party
of natives was outside the bungalow, I went out only to find it was
" Tuang-ku ". Every possible whistle it was able to imitate.
Unlike most birds it was not at all shy of airing its accomplish-
ments, one had only to go up and speak and a long flow of language
followed. I am quite confident that the bird knew what it was saying.
This bird had originally belonged to the owner of the estate, who,
I understand, had given a big price for it, but so loquacious had it
proved to be that it was given to the Chinese storekeeper. I believe
it proved a great attraction at first with the Malays, but like all other
novel things, they soon grew tired of it and " Tuang-ku " was taken
from out of the shop and relegated to a dark back room. I believe
it used a very obscene Chinese word. Naturally I was most anxious
to acquire such a bird, but the Chinese owner was not anxious to
part with it. At all events we were invited to the store for dinner
on the Chinese New Year and what a feast it was ! with bird's-nest
soup, shark's fins, beche-de-mer, bamboo shoots, chopsuey, and
in fact every delicacy of China ! When the drinks had flowed freely
and everyone was in a good humour, I broached the question of
" Tuang-ku We pointed out that it was not getting the right food

and it was not looking at all well, in fact it might die at any
moment and that of course would be a great shame. So eventually
the bird became mine on the condition that I would give the children
some Chinese records, when I heard the records, I knew at once which
I would rather hear, the bird or the so-called Chinese music !
So " Tuang-ku " was borne back in triumph to the bungalow.
During my stay on the estate the bird had to be hung some distance
from the bungalow owing to its noise, which did not in the least disturb
me. Often wild birds would come around in answer to its calls and
whistles. The bird had such a varied repertoire of calls that it was
difficult to know which were its natural ones. These birds are quite
common in Malay and later on during my sojourn in Malaya I frequently
saw them flying over the garden, easily distinguishable by the round
white patch in the wing. Sometimes the birds would alight in the
rubber-trees and answer the tame bird. A Malay boy once brought
me a youngster which he had recently taken from the nest; as I had
so many birds I did not purchase it. The natives never treat " Softbills "
very well and none of these birds which I saw in captivity ever looked
in good condition.
" Tuang-ku " certainly talked better and more distinctly than any
parrot I have ever heard.
Alas ! he was fated never to leave his native shores: just before
we were leaving for England he died. It was my fault, and I have
never been able to forgive myself for the act which robbed me of a
real companion and friend. I felt that I had murdered him. I had
sweetened his rice with a small amount of sunbird mixture and, staying
away longer than I anticipated, the food went sour and he must have
eaten it. The next day I could see that he was fated to pass to " that
last strange change 55 . I could do very little. I stayed up all night
and at one o'clock he died on my knee. I never thought I could care
for anything or anybody as I cared for that bird. I felt his loss more
than if it had have been my best friend. For a time it was impossible
to realize that he had gone. I seemed to hear his voice everywhere,
I realized the terrible irrevocability of Death. What would I not have
given if I could have but saved him ! Poor " Tuang-ku ", we buried
him in the full blaze of a tropic day beneath the waving palms near

a white coral beach. I felt as though my heart was buried there with
him too. We planted a palm-tree over his grave and perhaps in
time his remains will be transmuted into the green leaves which
will reach up as though to meet the brilliant tropic sun by day
and the pale silvery moon by night. Even now I can hardly bear
to think or write of him.
To get back to the market in Penang. Another bird seen in great
quantities is the well-known Southern Bed-whiskered Bulbul ( Otocompsa
jocosa erythrotis), a common but to my mind exceedingly handsome
bird with its trim and immaculate black and white plumage set off
with a dash of crimson on the cheeks. These birds are greatly prized
as songsters and the price asked was very moderate--30 cents, or 9 d.
in English money, which was also the price of the exquisite little
Malayan Hanging Parrots. Who could possibly resist these ? I had
to buy a dozen just to release them from their miserable little prison.
It seems the rule in Malaya to keep these little birds in incredibly
small bamboo cages, and once in these there is no way of getting
them out again unless the cage is cut to pieces. Needless to say they
soon get into a horribly sticky mess, and their life in captivity is, alas,
very short indeed. I think these are amongst the world's most beautiful
parrots.
As I was expecting to go on to Manchukuo and possibly Siberia,
it was impossible to take these birds on with me, so my friend arranged
with a Malay to look after them until I returned. Another bird which
I was unable to resist was the huge Bulbul, the Yellow-crowned
(.Trachycomus zeylanicus), rather a misnomer for a bird which has
an orange head. This is one of the giants of the family, and is about
the size of a Missel Thrush, and is rather a striking bird in appearance.
Later on in Singapore we saw cages full of these wretched birds all
in the most dreadful condition. It is stated that this bird is greatly
prized by the Malays on account of its sweet song, but I never saw
one kept by a Malay. This Bulbul is confined to the Malay Peninsula,
Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and is found only in the vegetation
bordering rivers.
I naturally made inquiries regarding the wonderful pheasants
which are found in Malaya and I was told by a Malay that he had

a very rare one. I felt quite thrilled for the moment, thinking it might
be an Argus, but it turned out to be a young male Javanese Peafowl,
the price asked was the equivalent of 35s., which I found afterwards
was a very reasonable price for one of these magnificent birds. I had
unfortunately to leave it, as I could hardly ask my friend to look
after it.
There were many examples of the Buffalo Mynah (Aethiopsar fuscus
torquatus), a bird which the natives say talks.
After the market ve visited the bird shops and saw there a galaxy
of old favourites, such as Diamo+/-id Sparrows, Cockatiels, Roseate,
Lemon-crested, and Mollucan Cockatoos, and Australians, such as
Zebra Finches, Budgerigars, etc. There w^ere many Malayan birds,
Java Sparrows (these in thousands), Dyal Birds, Babblers, Zosterops,
Weavers, Mongolian and Chinese Larks, also many examples of the
Malayan Shama, a very much larger and finer bird tnan the Indian
one. There were examples of a rare Starling from Siam, Sturno-
paster contra floweri, a strikingly handsome bird of black and white
colouring. I was very tempted to purchase a tame Black-capped Lory
and a Mollucan Cockatoo but I resisted.
On the whole I think the market and shops in Penang were better
than those of Singapore, certainly the birds were in better condition.
Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Maiaya was very disappointing
from a bird point of view. There was only one bird shop of any size,
but that was stocked with very few birds of indigenous origin, the
only ones being a quantity of Javanese Tree Ducks (Dendrocycna
javanica ). These birds I think were not of local origin but had come
from Java. They are very attractive and I felt rather tempted to
get some on my return, but I did not visit Kuala Lumpur again. The
price asked was very reasonable, only $1, or 2s. 4 d. Here there
were more overcrowded crates of doves and thousands of Java Sparrows,
in comparison with the tens of thousands of these latter birds which
one sees in the bird shops there seem to be very few kept by the natives.
I rather fancy that they, like the Sunbirds and flower-peckers, are
used for culinary purposes by the rich Chinese, the wretched birds being
clapped alive into a ball of clay and thrown into an oven, later on
when the bird is taken out all the feathers come off in the clay. Efforts

have been made to stop this traffic, but it is very difficult, as the
Chinaman's idea seems to be that everything alive was made to eat.
Here, too, were many old Australian favourites, Swainson's Lorikeets,
various finches, etc. There were various Mynahs, and one of the
small " Island " Cockatoos ( K . sulphur ea). I noticed many Ring-
necked Parrakeets, but they were not the Indian ones. The native
market was searched in vain for pheasants, but I did not know then
that all the Malayan Pheasants are strictly protected, none is allowed
to be exported or sold and no pheasants of any kind from Malaya are
brought to this country. Those which we get are from Siam, Borneo,
and Sumatra. At one time I believe Fire-backs were offered in the
market for food. A pathetic sight in the livestock market in Kuala
Lumpur was a number of cages of little fat woolly puppies intended
for Chinese " chow ", though I don't see there's a great difference
between eating a puppy or a lamb. It is just a question of custom.
Ever since my acquaintance with the tropics, mangrove swamps
have proved a never-ending source of interest. In fact, to anyone
interested in Nature, the exploration of these so-called abodes of
fever provides a fascinating study. These swamps are an Eldorado
for every branch of Zoology--for the ornithologist, the pisciculturist,
the entomologist, etc. The swamps have their own special forms of
life, which are not found elsewhere. There are even many species
of Sunbirds which are found only in these places, and they are specially
the haunt of Kingfishers.
Most of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula is fringed with
vast tracts of these marine forests and nothing gave me greater pleasure
than to hire a " sampan " and leisurely drift with the tide up the
endless creeks which intersect these vast areas of "no man's land ".
It is here that one sees the most brilliant Malayan birds, for little
of this area has been interfered with by Man, except near towns,
where the trees have been cut down for firewood. Inland where the
forests originally were, the land has been cleared for vast plantations
of rubber estates and with the disappearance of the native flora both
the birds and the insects have vanished. In fact one sees very few
birds in Malaya except where the indigenous forest has been left.
Rubber planters will tell you: " Oh, there are no birds in Malaya

except a few sparrows ! " In the swamps remain the native vegetation
with the indigenous insects which feed on it and which in turn are
preyed upon by the birds.
After the blazing heat of towns, and ships, the peace and quietude,
the calm waters and pleasant green shade provide a much appreciated
haven of refuge. It. is quite impossible to land in most of the creeks,
for the moment one's foot touches the " land ", one sinks up to the
waist in bottomless mud. It is very tantalizing, for on every hand
one hears a chorus of bird calls, but is unable to follow them up. As
mentioned before, Kingfishers are the commonest birds, but what a
galaxy of these gorgeously apparelled birds there are. First there is
the exquisite White-collared ( Halcyon chloris humii), a medium-sized
bird of snow white and brilliant azure blue. This is one of the
" Halcyon " group which find their food not by fishing but by preying
upon small land animals such as crabs, lizards, centipedes, etc. This
is one of the commonest birds in Malaya and is found all along the
sea coasts and is a very conspicuous object in the towns and villages
which border the water. It takes up its position in some advantageous
place, such as the top of a dead tree or on a post, and from there swoops
down at any small living object within vision. I have frequently seen
the nesting holes high up in the trunk of a dead and decayed tree.
This bird would no doubt be easy to keep in captivity. I still have
a closely allied species from Australia, the Mangrove Kingfisher, which
I have had in captivity for several years. Another common Kingfisher
is the equally lovely White-throated (. Halcyon smyrnensis), a bird
with a very wide range. It is a little larger than the former with rich
brown breast, white throat, and brilliant blue wings and tail. This
is common all over Malaya and differs from the other bird in being
found inland, and is often seen in parks and gardens in the towns.
In the old days it formed the largest percentage of " trade skins "
exported to Europe for millinery purposes; since those days it has
no doubt increased. I saw one specimen in captivity but it had
recently been caught and was very wild and doubtless would not
survive long.
A much smaller bird than the previous one is the Common Malayan
Kingfisher (Alcedo atthis hengalensis) , a bird almost indistinguishable

from our European one. It fishes in the true- Kingfisher style and is
to be seen darting low over the waters of the creeks or sitting on the
aerial roots of the mangrove trees just above the water waiting for
its prey.
The most beautiful of all is the lovely Pileated or Black-capped
Kingfisher ( Halcyon pileata) a bird of multi-coloured plumage and
of larger size, its brilliant plumage is set off by a large red beak. As if
conscious of its vivid coloration it is shy and rather suspicious, and
it is very difficult to get a close view. It is a bird almost exclusively
of the mangrove swamps and is seldom seen inland. It feeds mainly
on crabs and no doubt on the quaint mud-skippers which are seen
in thousands on the banks of the creeks or basking on the roots of
the trees. Another Kingfisher sometimes seen and never forgotten
is the unique Buddy or Lilac (. Halcyon coromanda), which is clad in
a very peculiar shade of brilliant golden rufous shot with shining lilac
or mauve with the back silvery blue. Seen flashing through the sombre
tunnels of green vegetation over the inlets which intersect the swamps
it presents a picture of incredible beauty. It is shy and wary and
is the least common of the lot. I only saw it in the vast mangrove
swamps which border the coast of Selangor.
The beautiful Chestnut-backed Bee-eater ( Merops viridis), is
commonly seen in pairs hawking for insects over the creeks in the
swamps, its favourite perch being on an exposed branch overhanging
the stream from which it takes excursions over the water for flying
insects. These birds are not suspicious like the Kingfishers, and they
will allow one almost to pass beneath them before taking wing. At
times I have seen them hawking for insects with the Swallows out
over the sea at the mouths of the creeks.
Perhaps the most brilliant or at least the most conspicuous bird
of the swamps is the Black-naped Oriole ( Oriolus chinensis indicus).
A bird of the most vivid golden yellow and black plumage and with
a loud melodious call. It is a bird which would catch the eye of the
most unobservant and the sight of this brilliant creature flashing
through the cool green archways over the streams lingers long in
one's memory. It is only a winter visitor, returning to China and
Manchukuo in the spring to breed.

S. Porter--Wanderings in the Far East
A bird which is the very antithesis of the foregoing is the Black-
necked Tailor Bird ( Orthotomus atrogularis), a quiet and unobtrusive
little bird inhabiting the lower foliage in the swamps. It is famous
for its unique habit of sewing together large leaves in the form of
a pouch or pocket in which it makes its nest. It is of warbler-like
appearance, and has a reddish head, long beak, and tail which is
carried at an elevated angle. I later became very familiar with this
little bird whilst staying in Johore, it frequented the bushes around
the bungalow, always on the search for small insects upon which it
lives. It has a very distinctive call, a loud " tweet-tweet ", which at
once enables one to locate it. I was never lucky enough to find the
nest, though I think it was the nesting time during the period I was
there (January to March). These little birds are quite fearless, and
I was able to watch them through my bedroom window, pursuing
their continual search for a livelihood, which I do not think is a very
hard task in the tropics.
The mud banks of the creeks which swarm with marine life make
an ideal home for the Common Sandpipers ( Tringoides hypotencies).
Malaya is the winter home, or at least one of them, of this very widely
distributed species, and here let us hope it finds sanctuary from the
man with the gun who is always waiting to " greet " it when it arrives
in its summer home in the north of Europe and Asia, though when
we hear of people bagging fifty couple of " snipe " (which is the name
of all small shore birds) in a morning near Singapore, it does not look
as if it gets much respite ever there.
I often saw the bird around the mud flats of the mangrove swamps,
either solitary or in pairs, but never in flocks, it is quite tame and
seldom takes wing, even when one passes only a few yards away.
When disturbed it flies low over the water with a soft, whistling cry,
and soon settles again on the mud-flats, where it searches for the
small Crustacea which form its main food.

BIRD WATCHING ON HICKLING BROAD

Having spent two enjoyable trips bird watching on Hickling Broad
it has been suggested that a few notes on the subject might be of
interest to readers of the Avicultural Magazine. Both visits were
made during the Easter holidays. The first was in 1935, and the party
consisted of four. This year the same four went again with an additional
one, all keen bird men. Unfortunately this Easter was a week earlier
than last year, and this deprived us of seeing some of the rarer and
later migrants which we were more fortunate in seeing on the previous
trip. The weather too this year was far from ideal, with a much lower
temperature and a persistent wind blowing most of the day. We
stayed at the village " pub ", " The Pleasure Boat ", a most excellent
spot in every way. The inn is right on the edge of the broad and from
our bedroom windows we had a magnificent view right down the
broad. The weather was very fickle, in the early morning the water
was as still as a mill-pond and with the sun shining brightly the broad
looked wonderfully blue against the tawny masses of reeds. Then as
" sure as eggs ", about 8 o'clock each day it clouded over and the
wind would get up and blow with an unpleasant force most of the
day. This had the effect of keeping what few earlier migrants had
arrived silent. We used to take out a rowing boat for the whole day
and row up the reed-fringed dykes and channels ; the tall reeds and
the dwarf willows here kept off the cold wind, and having drawn
to the bank we would lie listening for any unusual bird sounds. Last
year, as I said, Easter being a week later and the weather considerably
warmer, we were fortunate in hearing on the first night Bitterns booming
in various directions--one quite close. It is a most unique sound.
We were lucky too in putting up one and watching it wing its way
over the reeds--a sort of " owl-like-heron " flight. This year they
were not nearly as vocal, but one was very near and we could distinctly
hear the " intake ".
Perhaps I should explain to those who have not visited this beautiful
piece of water that bird life is very strictly preserved by the owner,
Lord Desborough, and the sanctuary is in charge of Mr. Jim Vincent,

H. Scott--Bird Watching on Hickling Broad
a very well-known naturalist. It is here that both the Marsh and
Montague's Harriers nest--one of the few remaining spots in England.
On an afternoon of our earlier visit we were taken by Mr. Vincent
to see the Marsh Harriers and we had a very surprising and pleasing
experience, for we were able to see at the same time five Harriers
in the air at once--both pairs of Marsh and Montague's and a female
Hen Harrier, resting there whilst on the Northern migration. This
unusual sight of all three species of Harriers in the air at the same
time has only been seen by Mr. Vincent on very few occasions during
his many years of watching, so we were indeed fortunate. Through
some very fine glasses I was able to get some splendid views of both
the March Harriers as they rested at intervals on some stunted trees
growing in the marsh. At other times they were quartering the
ground and several times we saw them bringing food for their young.
On another occasion we were taken to a small, sheltered piece of
water--this, too, was in 1935--which is frequented by Shovellers.
From this same piece of water a small party of Gargany Teal got up
and gave us a splendid view, the bluey grey tints of the drakes being
most noticeable. These beautiful little duck had only been here a
short while, having recently journeyed from the south to their nesting
haunts on this broad. The Shoveller drakes made a fine sight with
the sun shining on them as they circled around. It was near here
that we were shown the nest of a Bearded Reedling and saw both
cock and hen bird feeding young. This year we were not so lucky with
this species, though we heard their very distinctive but not loud note,
which resembles more than anything else two small coins being knocked
together. We only saw one bird which flitted past the boat.
On the last day of the 1935 trip two of the party had to leave
early so the remaining one and myself had a somewhat lazy morning.
Whilst lying in the boat in the full sun we saw a bird which we had
heard mentioned on several occasions but which we little expected to
see, a Black Tern. A beautiful specimen swooped and circled around
and gave us a first-rate view of this now rare bird. In the old days
it nested extensively in Norfolk and was there known as the Blue Darr.
This one was passing north on migration.
Among other birds we were keen to see was the Willow Tit; one

of our party had an intimate knowledge of it as it nests in his grounds
in North Norfolk. The single bird we did see I fear I should not have
recognized unless I had been put wise ; I should have passed it for
a Marsh Tit. But apparently the note was somewhat different and
the black of the head is of a duller tint.
The weather being cold and blustering kept the birds very quiet,
and only when the sun shone strongly for any length of time did we
get any bird notes and then only the more ordinary ones. Chief of
which were Willow Warblers and numerous Common Wrens whose
joyful song was heard in all directions ; also a fine Robin miles away
from any houses. It was too early for the Grasshopper Warbler, whose
curious song was heard quite frequently in 1935. Reed and Sedge
Warblers were much in evidence then. That year too a single Bewick's
Swan had chosen to stay and was consorting with the Mute Swans
which live on the broad. We had several good views of it and its
very straight neck was quite a distinctive feature. We did not see
it this year, and I did not hear if it had remained. Coots were extremely
tame and confiding and a pair used to swim up the narrow water-way
to the door of the inn. There were several pairs of Mallard, most of
which were fairly tame.
It occurred to me that such a wonderful expanse of water and
reeds and preserved as it is, ought to hold a wonderful lot of waterfowl
and I believe that if several pairs of the various species of British
wild fowl--a few pairs pinnioned and the rest with the flight feathers
of one wing clipped--were turned down, say in the autumn, those
with clipped wings would still be unable to fly till the following autumn
and would probably have nested in the meantime ; and from these a
nucleous of breeding birds would be established. I understand both
Gadwall and Pintail have become nesting species in Norfolk by similar
means.
While still on the subject of British birds--this, however, has
nothing to do with the broads--I should like to record the somewhat
curious habit of some Nightingales. There are many pairs round here
(Ipswich) though none actually nest in my garden, the nearest nest
would be three or four hundred yards away. But for the last three
years, from about the beginning of July until well into August, a single

This pretty Weaver lives in Kenya Colony, between Mount Kenya
and Kilimanjaro. The female differs from the male in having the entire
top and sides of the head black. In their native country they breed
in October and again in May, according to Hinde, but Jackson found
them breeding at Nandi in July, and reports that the nest resembles
that of the common Yellow Weaver, which was built in a small tree,
about ten feet from the ground. It contained three eggs, white or
blue with big brown spots. They do not seem to nest in colonies, but
isolated. Usually they are seen singly or two or three together, some-
times eight or ten. For members who do not know this bird I will
give the colours.
The cock bird : Front of head yellow, back of head to middle of
back, black ; remainder of back and tail, olive green ; under parts,
yellow ; wings, black and olive-green, and black line from beak to
back of eye.
The hen bird : The same as the above, with the exception of the
head, which is all black.
My friend, Mr. Guy Falkner, gave me a lot of Weavers he had
collected last year in Kenya, and as most of the birds were in eclipse
plumage, I did not know what varieties I had. These were all turned
out into a large aviary last April. The birds got into colour in May,
and soon began building. A nest that was built by a pair of silver-
eared Mesias in a cupressus, and used as a sleeping place by them, was
commandeered by the Weavers, and to this they added a good deal,
making the nest, Kidney stated, with the entrance-hole just under

When feeling in the nest on 16th June, it was found to contain three
eggs, the colour of which was pale blue, heavily speckled with reddish-
brown spots. Two young were hatched out on 25th June, one of which
disappeared five days later. The third egg was removed and found
to be infertile. The surviving young one left the nest on 12th July,
when he was almost as big as his parents. The colour of the young
bird is : Head, back wings, and tail, brownish-green, under parts pale
yellow, beak and feet, pale grey. The old birds had access to insec-
tivorous food, stock food, mixed fruit, and mixed seed, but it is not
known what the young one was reared on with the exception of meal-
worms which they were always looking for. The young one is now
(6th August) quite independent of its parents, who are at present
bringing up one or two more young ones. This bird has never before
been bred in captivity.

As no books that I have access to have described the young of the
Green Wood Quail (Rollulus roulroul), perhaps even a sketchy description
may be of information. The display of the parent birds consisted of
passing each other twigs, leaves, and various grasses, which they threw
in the air or over their backs. The cock every now and again pressing
his whole body, from the tip of his bill to his tail, to the ground and
emitting a staccato chuckling. His beak was wide open at the time, dis-
playing to the full the crimson gape. The hen was last seen on the
20th May, and did not appear again till the 7th June. During this time
she was fed by the cock, as she was never seen till she appeared again
with three chicks, dark rufous in colour, the back and head being almost
dark brown ; their size, if anything, smaller than a bantam chick.
Upon their wings becoming fully feathered a small creamy spot
appeared on the tip of each of the wing covert feathers. Apart from
this there seemed to be no difference in their original colouring. The
legs were grey and eyes reddish brown. The peculiar bristles on their

foreheads next appeared, and the feathers on the back, a dark olive
green, while the tail feathers were almost a dark bine-green. The breast,
now fully feathered, has merely turned a shade less rufous ; while the
head and neck are still in " down ". The third chick was taken out and
hand-reared, owing to both the parents and remaining chicks driving
it off with great brutality. Alas ! poor bird, it met an undignified death
by being sat on by my wife. It was very friendly and most intelligent,
but used to jump on the armchairs and sofas for an occasional siesta.
I measured the unhatched egg and found it to be 33 by 26 mm., rather
a sharp oval in shape, and white in colour, and of a fine, though poorly
glazed, surface. I was interested to note that both the parents and
chicks took to the trees when disturbed in spite of thickly planted
shrubs and grass. Another inmate of the aviary is a Crimson-fronted
Barbet, which I have found impossible to keep alive more than a month
or two unless hand-reared. Out of five reared by hand I have one
survivor now nearly three years old. His diet is mainly any soft fruit
and grain-powder mixed with water. There seems to be no difficulty
with any of the larger Barbets. I have always heard that Zebra Finches
were the world's record holders as regards reproducing their species,
but in my experience the Diamond Dove should be awarded the palm.
For whirlwind 100 per cent methods can you beat feeding two families
(their own) and sitting on a new clutch at the same time ? All my pairs
have either bred or are sitting for the fourth time since the end of
January (28th). They seem to be in such a hurry to finish off and start
again that they very often throw their young out of their ridiculous
nests. For this reason I hang a small saucer-shaped basket under-
neath the nest, and should an accident happen a ground-floor only a
few inches away is there to receive them.
Is the Crested or Topknot Pigeon hard to rear ? Mine never get
beyond the fully fledged state. Bronze-wings, however, do very well, and
are easily reared. I have often read that Sunbirds cannot be kept
together, but I find that if each bird is allowed one food-pot to itself
there seems to be no trouble. I have a pair of Purple-rumped and
Purple, as well as a pair of Mrs. Gould's and a single Nepalese Yellow-
backed--all in the same aviary, 20 by 10 by 11 feet. As an aid to feeding
insectivorous birds, including Sunbirds, I find a meaty bone or a piece

of offal wrapped in wire-gauze and suspended in the aviary is a great
help. Birds soon get to know its significance, and line up to catch the
first fly or gnat attracted. Sunbirds appear to dislike bathing in the
ordinary way, but prefer diving into dew or rain-soaked leaves. I have
seen them seizing a branch in their feet and vibrating their wings
amongst the wet leaves. A pair of Himalayan White-tailed Nut-
hatches prefer diving into their pond rather than use the rock in the
centre. They very often can scarcely reach the further side after their
plunge.

Mr. Ezra's account in the August number of his wonderful success
with his Hoopoes has encouraged me to resurrect from the pages of
Bird Notes the original account of the breeding in 1911, to which
Mr. Ezra refers at the end of his article, and which formed the basis
of the Hoopoe entry in Records of Birds Bred in Captivity (Witherby,
1926).
This was No. 326, and ran as follows :--
" Has been bred on several occasions," teste Neunzig ( Einh ., p. 428b
A success in the U.K. is recorded in B.N. 1911, 222, 257, and in the
October inset, Aronstein in Cork.
The Bird Notes account (p. 221 not 222) appeared in the August
and September numbers of the 1911 volume. I give it here in full, so
that it may be considered as a whole, and in conjunction with other
information since received.
" Nesting of Hoopoes "

" I think the fact of the nesting of my pair of this beautiful and
interesting species will be of general interest, more especially as I believe
this to be the first time that they have done so in captivity.
1 The name at the head of the account is as given above, but in later volumes
of Bird Notes it appears as " Mark Armstein I do not know which is correct.

E. Hopkinson--Breeding of Hoopoes
" The birds are a pair I procured from De Von and Co. in May, 1910 ;
they were somewhat wild at first, but after about three w r eeks they settled
down and developed into fine specimens of their kind.
" About the middle of May last, I noticed the hen looking--as I thought
--for a nesting site, and I immediately supplied her with a box and building
material, which she took to at once, and prepared it for occupation. The
first egg she laid on the ground, the remainder of the clutch were duly
deposited in the box. Incubation went forward very satisfactorily, and the
eggs proved fertile, they are due to hatch on 8th July. I have every hope
of being able to rear them, as the pair are exceptionally tame. The cock
is most attentive to his mate, and is constantly feeding her. The eggs are
rather long in shape and of a pale blue colour. She has sat very close from
the commencement. I found that if I trespassed anywhere near the nest she
made a peculiar spitting noise, somewhat like Tits.
" On 8th July five chicks were duly hatched out, and at the time of
writing (11th July), are going on splendidly. I had a look at them to-day,
and one would hardly believe the development made in a few days. When
first hatched they were almost white, now they are a dirty grey and about
three times the size they were when I first looked at them. I notice their
beaks at present are no different from those of young thrushes and
blackbirds.
" Diet.--I feed them as follows : D. D. and Co.'s best Nightingale Food.
This is mixed with raw eggs and silk-worm cocoons, and the whole fried in
fresh butter--the birds partake of this freely and thrive on it. I should
mention I place it in a box and cover with bran to the depth of four or five
inches. I also supply in another box, beetles, gentles, and mealworms, which
I also cover with bran, as I find this method gives them exercise in picking
out their foods, and helps them to keep in condition. That the foregoing
treatment is about right is amply demonstrated by the fact that, after a
year in captivity they were sufficiently fit and vigorous to attempt to repro-
duce their kind, with at any rate partial success, and with every indication
at the present that the young will be fully reared."
This concluded the August instalment of the account, and was
accompanied by an Editorial note to the effect that the young were
fully reared, and that further details would appear in the next issue.
Note the words " fully reared ", and yet the young could have
been then only 20 days old, from the dates given ; 8th July hatched,
28th July at the end of the article.
Mr. Aronstein's account continues (p. 257) :--
" Now that the young are fully reared, I can offer the following additional
particulars :--
" The hen alone incubated. I never once saw her off the nest, she sat so
close that I was under the impression that she must be dead in the nest, and
became so anxious that I put in my hand and was relieved to find she was
all right--she is so tame that she did not come off, merely making a sort of
' spitting ' prote st. I regret I cannot give exact period of incubation as she
was sitting some days before I was aware of a so interesting an occurrence.

" The nesting place was quite a dark corner, behind a box placed behind
two old breeding cages ; behind this box I noticed her going in and out,
and concluded that she was looking for a nesting site, so I placed an ordinary
flat chocolate box, into which I put a little chopped hay; she made no
attempt to form a nest, but laid her eggs in the receptacle just as it was
placed for her. The young now leave the nest box, but go back to it again ;
they have not come down to the ground yet. They are in grand feather,
and almost equal to the old birds in colour ; three of them now have beaks
fully inches long, and they erect their crests well; the latter remind you
of the crest of the Rose-crested Cockatoo, a double formation, V-shaped.
" I have just noticed that the old pair are now going through the quaint
antics they indulged in before nesting commenced. The cock will take a
mealworm and offer it to the hen, she opens her beak and he places it almost
inside, but withdraws it again ; this he will continue for five or six minutes,
just as if it were to tease her ; for this reason I am expecting them to
nest again.
" It will probably be of interest if I state that my aviary is rather
small, and the number and mixture of its occupants will doubtless occasion
some surprise. (List of these given, see below.)
" I have had four clutches of Blue-winged Sugar-birds eggs hatched out,
but ... in each instance they died after the third or fourth day, owing to
being unable to get enough insect food. Having such a large number flying
together in a limited space, it is most difficult to supply sufficient live food.
To-day (28th July) the first egg of their fifth clutch has been laid, and I am
hoping for better luck."
The list is indeed surprising for it includes about sixty birds ;
British Finches, about a dozen small Foreign Seed-eaters, a Pope, a
pair of White-headed Tits, a Golden Oriole, three Waxwings, a Wood-
warbler, a pair of Sugar-birds, and the two Hoopoes and their five young.
The wonder is that anything could breed in such mixed company,
especially such small birds as the Sugar-birds, which five times got as
far as young which lived for a day or two. It is rather a pity that the
actual dimensions of the aviary are not given, for one knows how
widely different are people&apos;s ideas as to the meaning of " small " (or,
for that matter, " large ") when speaking of aviaries or cages.
We get no more information about the Hoopoes later in the
volume, but in the October inset the Editor includes " Hoopoe, M.
Armstein " in the list of those qualified for a medal for breeding a
species " for the first time in this country or captivity ", and on p. 189
of the 1912 volume, also includes it in his list of birds bred in captivity.
By the time my Summary of Breeding records appeared (1932),
I had become rather sceptical about this record, and some of my friends
even more so, so that in that Summary I put the Hoopoe among the

As regards the German record (presumably earlier than our Irish
one), Karl Neunzig is my authority. In his Einheimische Stubenvog&apos;el
(Magdeburg, 1913) he says, " bred several times ", and gives a Herr
Koder of Nuremberg as one who had attained success, but he gives no
particulars or references, though even in their absence, we can take the
fact of their having been bred abroad as established, for in everything
this German work with its companion volume on Foreign Birds is
always accurate.
Can anyone supply further particulars of the above, or other cases
of breeding Hoopoes ?
In " Members Advertisements " in Bird Notes for September, 1911,
this advertisement appeared: " For Sale, guaranteed aviary-bred
Hoopoes, in perfect feather, bred by me this season. Two cocks, one hen ;
30s. each or #4 the three.--M. Armstein, 30 Grand Parade, Cork."
I at once wrote for and received two, certainly birds of the year.
They were in good condition, and very tame. I kept them for from 12
to 18 months. I cannot now recall excactly how long, they died while
I was away from home. I see no reason why the record should not be
accepted as genuine.

I am sorry to think that my last notes in this Magazine should have
appeared after the death of our late President and great friend, Mr. G.
Blay. Possibly some of the remarks I made will have seemed in poor
taste, but the Magazine had gone to print, and I could do nothing.
Mr. Blay was instrumental in the formation of our Society, and we held

the inaugural meeting at his house, and also a general meeting and
garden party only two weeks before his death.
From the date of the inaugural meeting to the day of his death he
took an extraordinary interest in our affairs. He was a man of very
definite decisions, but was never dogmatic.
On the day before his death he wrote to Mr. Lambert, and I think
his words are worth repeating : " I do not agree with your views, but,
of course, I am always anxious to support the Committee, and would
not dream of opposing them."
That sentence sums up in a few words his delightful character.
Although he had fixed and concise ideas he was so interested in our work
that he would never oppose the Committee if they came to a decision ;
this is surely the right spirit.
The O.P.S. has lost its best friend and adviser, and we shall, more-
over, always miss his generosity. He was a wonderful collector of
Pheasants and other birds, he would spare no expense provided he
knew he was having a fair deal, and he loathed any underhand dealings,
and was the very soul of integrity and honour. It is sad to think that
such a great aviculturist has passed over, but we shall do everything
in our power to perpetuate his memory, and in our future activities-
we shall always respect his one emphatic wish, and that was that we
should not accept charity and should be self-supporting.
After the last general meeting Mr. Blay took some of the Committee
to Surbiton Station, and when a member of this Committee endeavoured
to express his thanks to him he stopped him with the remark : " Don't
say another word, you know I like to do all I can for the O.P.S." Then
he whispered : " If the Society are ever short of cash, just let me
know ; but I insist that this shall be an anonymous gift."
That remark was typical of all that he did for the O.P.S. We mourn
his loss, but his memory will for ever be with us.

COCKATEILS AS FOSTER PARENTS

Madam,-- Re foster parents, I find that a good pair of breeding Cockateils
make excellent fosters, and I do not see why they should not be excellent
for rearing more valuable Parrot-like birds.
I have an old pair that will not only rear their own, but do not object
to bring up other Cockateil babies and Budgies, in fact any poor baby whose
parents prove heartless they will adopt and bring up whether they have young
of their own at the time or not.
In fact, I have found Cockateils excellent parents, but sometimes young
birds on their first nests will neglect the young (the fault being with the cock
I always think), but if I find the cock throwing out the babies or neglecting
them, I just pop them into an old-timer's nest, and they will rear them, and
later on the young pair will learn better ways.

Madam, --For the second time in succession I have lost several rare and
valuable Australian Parrakeets, carefully selected and packed, owing to
another person with an import permit bringing over on the same boat diseased
and badly packed birds that started an epidemic of infectious enteritis (always
identified with psittacosis by the Ministry of Health) which spread from
his birds to mine. It is difficult enough to get parrot-like birds into the
country already, and this kind of stupid and inhumane carelessness is the
best way of getting imports stopped entirely.
Infectious enteritis is a dirt disease pure and simple, and never occurs
where birds are properly packed, not more than two together, in roomy boxes
or cages provided with floor trays and perches which can be, and are, taken
out regularly and cleaned.

tailed Finch, is a native of Australia, and is not considered hardy
even in its own country. In Yol. XI, fourth series, of the Avicultural
Magazine, pp. 412-14, Mr. H. V. Highman, Hon. Secretary of the
Avicultural Society of Western Australia, describes their nesting and
successful rearing of young in confinement in a large outdoor aviary
among a mixed collection of birds. The nest was constructed of grass,
oval in shape with a side entrance, and both birds incubated the three
white eggs in turn. They ate a great deal of soft food, a mixture of
crushed biscuit, dried flies, and egg yolk. Incubation lasted a fortnight,
the young had luminous globules on each side of the gape like Gouldians,
and were reared almost entirely on the soft food. The fledglings were
drab olive green, did not show any real sign of colour until three months
old, and did not moult into complete adult plumage until six months
of age. Sexes are not distinguishable with certainty until then.
Mr. Highman's pair went to nest four times and reared seven young,
the same nest was used throughout.
The following year Mr. S. D. Potter also bred these Finches, but
his birds behaved quite differently from Mr. Highman's. He writes

was undertaken almost entirely by the male, that a fresh nest was

By the Marquis oe Tavistock
The past summer has been a moderate season, the great amount
of wet and cold in the early part having a discouraging effect on some
birds and being, perhaps, responsible for a rather unduly high mortality
of young in the nest.
Plum-headed Parrakeets were a complete failure; a lutinistic
hen paired to a normal cock had clear eggs, as also had a lutinistic
pair. A normal-coloured hen bred by myself from lutinistic parents
and paired to a normal cock hatched a brood, but lost them at various
ages, and the only survivor was so rickety that it had to be destroyed.
I am coming to the conclusion that P. cyanocephala is one of the most
difficult of all Parrakeets to breed and fully rear. It insists on nesting
very early and, if kept back long enough to give its young a chance
of escaping the spring frosts, falls into moult. Although they get on
all right on first leaving the nest, the young birds after a few months
enter on a period of extreme delicacy which continues at least until
they are through their first complete moult, i.e. until they are about
eighteen months old.
A hen Plum-head paired to a cock Slaty-head reared one strong
hybrid, losing the remainder of the brood in the nest. I bred this
cross a few years ago from different parents.
Ringnecks also had a bad season ; various pairs of lutino-breds
had clear eggs or lost their young in the nest, and one lutino hen bred
by myself did not lay at all. I also lost a lutino-bred cock, his widow
rearing one green young one.

A lutino hen, the sister of the one just mentioned, reared two
nice lutino-bred greens, her mate being a wild green cock.
The rarer Psittacula did better ; although one pair of Malabars
fell into moult as a result of being kept back too long in deference
to the egg-binding propensities of the hen, the other pair reared three
very fine young ones. Derbyans also reared three fine young. The
young cock I bred last year unfortunately died of a chill produced
by the vile weather of early June. I at that time supposed him to
be a hen as his beak colour had turned as black as his mother's and
showed no sign of turning back to orange. I know of no bird in which
one sex--the male--is so markedly more delicate in confinement than
the other.
The three pairs of Layards all nested, but one hen had clear eggs ;
the second (a pinioned bird) lost all her young ; while only the third
reared a good brood of four, one being somewhat lutinistic. The
successful pair insisted on making their nest-hole very low down in
their log and but little above ground level. The pair of Layards of
last year's breeding which I had kept turned out to be two hens, but
they did not exhibit any of the abnormal delicacy of young Plum-heads
when put back in the aviary after a winter indoors. It is noteworthy
that young Derbyans, Malabars, and Plum-heads all leave the nest
with red beaks which, after a few months, turn black, and, in the
case of the males, back again to red later.
Eoseate Cockatoos were a failure. A white-bred cock and a normal
hen lost their young when about half-grown. My old white cock was
remated rather late in the year to an albino hen and she did not
lay. His mate of last year was put with a supposed albino cock, but
I am inclined to think " he " is a hen too and a broken egg was the
only result.
After a good deal of trouble with infertile cocks I at last achieved
success with Leadbeaters and two very fine young ones have been
reared. Gang-gangs did nothing, but the cock is a useless creature,
pinioned and a plucker both of himself and his mate.
Palm Cockatoos did nothing and the old hen Banksian laid an
egg on the floor of the shelter and broke it.
The two pairs of Eacket-tailed Parrots showed considerable interest

in their nests but did not lay, being, I think, put ofi by the bad weather
in early June. The new pair had wintered successfully in an outdoor
aviary with a well-heated shelter. The secret with these beautiful
but often difficult birds seems to be to import them only in spring
and summer and get them into movable outdoor aviaries as quickly
as possible. If you have to keep them caged for a long time you are
almost sure to lose them.
The Queen of Bavaria Conures did not lay for the second year in
succession. I think the weather was again to blame as, although the
species is quite hardy, it seems to need really hot weather to bring
it into full breeding condition.
After an unsuccessful initial venture with a pinioned cock and an
extremely delicate hen, I succeeded last year in obtaining three Red-
breasted Conures with sounder constitutions which spent most of the
winter in a movable outdoor aviary with a heated shelter. In the
spring the cock paired with both ladies who lived amicably together
and eventually two eggs were laid, of which he took almost sole charge,
but unfortunately without result.
The Blue-fronted Amazons--normal cock and lutino hen--got as
far as pairing but again no eggs appeared. I am going, next year,
to try whether another pair in the next aviary may set them a good
example which they will be encouraged to emulate !
My old pair of Barrabands hatched three young but when they
were almost ready to leave the nest the hen fell ill and died. I had
had her about sixteen years. The cock reared the family alone but
one young hen killed herself in a night alarm. When newly fledged
young Barrabands are fearfully nervous and dash violently about on
the slightest provocation. Rock Peplars hatched two ; one died in
the nest and the other was reared but it was not a very good bird, i
The hen, whom I intend to dispose of, is the brightest-coloured one
that I have ever had but she is such an idiot that I can endure her
follies no longer. She has a rooted objection to a sensible kind of
nest and for years used to lay her eggs from the perch and then incubate
the abstract idea of them at the place from which they had been
projected earthwards. Finally she condescended to use a box with
a wooden bottom of a type not well suited to infant Rock Peplars

and though she reared a few young in it she has proved latterly a
lazy feeder.
Crimson-wings which for years have been regular and successful
breeders failed entirely this season. My old breeding hen had died
and her successor refused to take to any kind of nest or sit on eggs
anywhere but on the floor of the aviary shelter, a hopeless place for
a species whose young above all things need to be in the open air.
The second hen hatched two young but lost them inexplicably when
half-grown. She laid again but got bored and deserted her fertile eggs
a few days before they were due to hatch. Hen Crimson-wings are
not enthusiastic sitters. Normally single-brooded, they can rarely
bring themselves to incubate two clutches of eggs for the full time
in the same season and the Keston Foreign Bird Farm have a hen
whose ideas of the period of incubation for Crimson-wings are unhappily
about three days short of Nature's, so even the first clutch is deserted
when on the point of hatching !
The old breeding hen King, after wasting two seasons with an
infertile mate, again this year reared a nice family of four with a
new cock.
A cock Salwatty and hen Amboina King had had a stormy matri-
monial career. Three years ago they produced a young one but it
w r as rickety and died after leaving the nest. Shortly after this tragedy
the hen suddenly turned on her mate and scalped him.
Next spring they were again introduced and seemed pleased to
see each other but within twenty-four hours the Amboina once more
scalped her husband. Last year I kept them apart, but this season,
being short of aviary room, I decided to treat the Amboina as one
treats cock Parrakeets that are dangerous bullies and partly cut her
wing. They agreed all right but did not nest.
With the exception of the Browns, which, after their maddening
custom, wasted the whole summer in two successive moults, Broad-
tails did fairly well. The old pair of Mealy Rosellas reared two
broods of five and three. A second pair had five but the cock took
a sudden and violent dislike to one of his offspring and tore off its
upper mandible. The others were not molested and the pair did not
nest again. Oddly enough a very prolific and reliable breeding cock

I. Harman--Two Handsome Honeyeaters
Red Rosella at Keston this year behaved in the same way. Yellow-
mantled Rosellas reared four and have another brood in the nest.
A young cock Yellow-belly I bred two years ago and a new hen
had a family of five but one was killed in the same night alarm as
killed the Barraband. The old pair have young in the nest.
Pennants had two good young ones and one rickety one that had
to be destroyed.
Yellow-rumps also had two good young and one rickety one.
The cock Stanley died when the hen was only starting to lay,
but she finished her clutch and hatched four and reared them single-
handed.
The success with Swift Parrakeets has been recorded elsewhere,
one pair rearing two young and the other, one.
A pair of Sclaters Hanging Parrots had been very anxious to nest
all winter. They soon took to a nest but the hen got badly egg-
bound with a soft-shelled egg which had to be removed artificially--
a difficult operation, reflecting credit on my aviary attendants' skill.
Some weeks later she laid a normal egg, also with difficulty, and
incubated it, but it proved clear. A further attempt was made but
the first egg disappeared and the second is now being sat on. The
Sclaters are the first tame and friendly Hanging Parrots I have had
but I fear, like all their genus, they are going to prove infertile in
captivity in this country--I wonder why ?

It is surprising bow rarely one comes across any of the Honeyeaters
in captivity. This great Australian family, the Meliphagidae , includes
151 species, every one of which is worthy of a place in the bird-room.
This large company is divided up into many sub-families, and the
species vary considerably in appearance and coloration. Not all of
them are gaily coloured as the well-known Noisy Miner ( Myzantha,
garrula) which looks like one of the Starling family. Some are most
curious as the Friar-bird (Tropidorhynchus corniculatus) and the
Yellow Wattle-bird (. Acanthochaera carunculata).

But the vast majority of these birds are small in size, from that
of a Willow Warbler to a Hawfinch, and of extremely graceful shape,
with slender bills fitted for probing flowers, and a kind of brush at the
tip of their long tongues. It would be useless to try to review such
a vast family in a single article, and so I will confine my remarks to
two species, familiar to me from personal observation, which have
recently been imported in small numbers.
First, the White-bearded Honeyeater (Meliornis novae-hollandiae),
a striking little bird with fierce-looking white eyes. The coloration
is not very easy to describe. The head is glossy jet black ; a white
line over the eye ; a tuft of silky white feathers on each side of the
throat, and another similar tuft lower down on each side of the neck.
The upper parts are mottled brown and black ; wings and tail black
and chocolate brown, with a conspicuous patch of lemon yellow on
the outer edges of the wing quills ; under parts white, thickly striped
with black ; irides white ; bill sharp-pointed, black ; length, about
inches. Habitat: Tasmania, Bass Strait Islands, New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia, and the more southerly part of Queensland.
Though normally found in almost any type of country where there
are any flowering trees, this bird is easily attracted in great numbers
to any garden in its native land by planting a species of Laburnum
{ Cytisus) popularly called the Tree Lucerne. This tree, a number
of which were growing in the garden of a house in Tasmania where
I lived for some years, bears masses of white pea-type blooms all
the winter months.
As soon as the autumn days arrived, so came the White-bearded
Honeyeaters. During the summer they moved away from the coastal
scrubs into the cool, heavily timbered gullies and mountain sides,
where they breed. Besides the White-bearded species, several smaller
kinds would approach the trees, but alas ! the White-bearded is as
fierce as he looks, and is a regular little demon towards his brother
Honeyeaters.
Almost any time I entered the garden one of these Honeyeaters
would be found perching cheekily on the highest twig of a bush, chatter-
ing away in its characteristic monotonous, rasping, chattering voice,
apparently issuing a challenge to all and sundry. Sooner or later his

gaze falls upon a mild Spine-bill or a Crescent Honeyeater feeding
in all innocence upon tbe very same busb as bis exbalted self. Such
impudence ! Surely the fellow has no right to do such a thing! Were
not the Lucernes planted just for the benefit of White-bearded Honey-
eaters ? Then, without further reflection, our conceited little bird
makes a furious swoop on the invader into sacred realm with a loud
snapping of the bill.
Not enough just to scare the wits out of the gentler bird with
hawk-like descent. He must be chased and chased until he would
never dare venture in the garden again. So up in the air the two birds
go, the White-bearded following like a Skua after a Tern. The hunted
one darts down like lightning into the thicket hedge, but the chase
goes on until he is forced to find a more comfortable feeding-ground,,
or wait until an opportunity occurs to creep back into the garden,
unseen by his enemies. White-bearded Honeyeaters spar with each-
other when there is no other bird to fight.
These birds are always very fascinating to watch, the golden-edged
wings flashing in the sun as they fly swiftly from shrub to shrub making
a pretty sight. In its actions, however, the White-bearded Honeyeater
is slow when compared with the brisk alertness of the Spine-bill. Like
most of the family this bird is nomadic or quite possibly migratory,
though most text-books consider it a stationary bird. In Tasmania,
at any rate, it retires to the more mountainous districts in summer,
at which season it feeds mostly on insects, which it often catches
on the wing like a Flycatcher. In the autumn it invades the gardens
and also orchards to feed on half-rotten apples and pears.
Thickets of Ti-tree which almost always grow near streams are its
favourite nesting grounds. The nest itself is usually placed about
ten or fifteen feet from the ground, not at all well concealed, but often
very difficult of access on account of the prickly shrubs in which it is
concealed. It is an untidy affair of fine twigs and grasses, but is always
cosily lined with sheep's wool, or the cottony fibres of native flax.
Two or three eggs are laid, and these are very pretty. They are of
a pinkish buff colour, spotted at the larger end with reddish-chestnut,
this often forming a zone. When its nest is approached the White-
bearded Honeyeater becomes very excited, and gives itself away by

giving forth a continuous screeching until one is fairly deafened with
the monotony of the sound.
The other Honeyeater I shall describe is a smaller and infinitely
more beautiful one, the Spine-bill (.Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris).
Briefly this may be described as looking something like a large Yellow-
winged Sugar-bird in shape, but rich chestnut below and dark green
and blackish above. The actual colouring is as follows : Crown shining
greenish-black ; back of the neck chestnut-rufus, passing into chestnut-
brown on the back ; rump greenish grey ; throat, cheeks, and chest
white, the first with a patch of chestnut-brown in the centre ; black
half-moon shaped band on the side of the chest; abdomen chestnut,
lighter under the tail; wings and tail mostly black, with greenish
tints; length, about 4 to 5 inches. Habitat: Tasmania, King
Island, Furneaux group (in Bass Strait), New South Wales, Victoria,
South Australia, and Queensland.
Though possibly not quite so common as the last-mentioned species,
the Spine-bill is very evenly distributed in all parts of its range, but
is particularly common on the dry scrub country, covered with Austra-
lian Heaths ( Epacris ). In the winter these plants flower, and then
are visited by regular little flocks of Spine-bills which cling to the
stems and suck out the sweet nectar.
It is a pretty sight to come across a number of these birds crossing
Epacris country. They are so elegant in flight, and dainty in move-
ments. Mostly they feed on low-growing flowering shrubs and plants,
and rarely frequent the high Eucalyptus trees, the haunt of many
species of Honey eaters. In disposition the Spine-bill is most fearless,
and allows itself to be approached very closely, a fact which leads
to the destruction of many of its numbers by small boys armed with
air rifles and catapults.
An unusual habit of this lovely little bird is to hover Humming-
bird-like in front of flowers, at which times the tail is very widely
spread, plainly displaying the white outer feathers, normally not
noticeable. Its vocal capacities are limited to a decidedly shrill little
note.
The nest is very hard indeed to find. It is a neatly made cup-shaped
structure, composed of moss and strips of bark from Eucalyptus trees,

and is lined with grass, then feathers. It is placed in a thick bush.
The eggs number from two to three, and are buff-pink, sparsely spotted
with rich brcwn and a little purplish grey.
I should imagine that if obtained in good condition both the White-
bearded and Spine-bill Honeyeaters would be very easy to maintain
in captivity. Some specimens of the Spine-bill which I saw a few weeks-
ago in a London store looked rather the worse for their journey. There
is, however, a lovely specimen in the newly fitted-out natural forest
aviary in the Small Bird's House at the London Zoo. This was pre-
sented to the Society by the Hon. Anthony Chaplin some years ago.
I have often admired it.
Incidentally, why is there nowhere to sit down in the Small Bird's
House ? I am seriously considering taking a deck chair with me next
time I go there as a formal protest !

Once again I have the pleasure of recording my breeding successes
from 1st July, 1935, to 30th June, 1936.
Melba Finch (Pytelia melba ).--I must admit that this species had
me puzzled for over a season on account of continual failures. I always
encouraged these birds to nest under cover, and in the majority of
cases the young were dead in the shell. This finally led me to believe
that insufficient moisture was obtained for the natural development
of the young. I then liberated this particular pair into a large garden
aviary, where they nested straight away, and eventually raised three
strapping youngsters. When only a week out of their nest, the cock
built again, this time raising two more. From the following nest,
No. 3, three more young ones flew, but at this stage trouble began.
The young Melbas from the first nest had coloured up. Unfortunately
I discovered too late that the old birds were busily occupying their
time chasing them round their 50 ft. flight most of the day, neglecting
the three latest fledglings, which obviously died of starvation. I would,

therefore, advise fanciers who intend to breed this species, to separate
the young immediately when independent from their parents. Two
further young ones were recently reared. Actually ten young Melbas
left their nests, raised by the one pair. Two were lost in the first
moult, leaving me five for the season ; not a very high average, but
I expect to do better next season on the foregoing experience. I have
found them most consistent layers, and I feel sure if fanciers con-
centrated on the Melba Finch the trouble would repay them hand-
somely. Three to four white eggs are usually laid, and their loosely
made nests, oval in shape, are thickly lined with feathers. Incubation
usually occupies twelve to thirteen days. There is nothing striking
in the coloration of the fledglings, being mainly olivaceous above,
and greyish-green below. Kump and lower tail feathers red, beak black.
Live food, such as termites, mealworms, etc., are essential, and they
are particularly fond of young succulent grass ; when feeding young
they consume a considerable amount.
Bronze Mannikins (Spermestes cucullata ).--These birds have
proved most prolific. One pair reared eighteen young. One outstanding
nest of six was raised, although four or five eggs appear to be the
usual clutch. I have raised these birds without any prepared food,
but consider that they do better on a little live food, and for this
reason I should think they might prove better foster parents for some
of the rarer foreigners than the Bengalese, the latter not being partial
to live food.
Cordon Bleu (Urwginthus phcenicotis ).--These lovely little Wax-
bills are extremely delicate when first imported. After moulting,
however, they appear to be quite hardy in this climate. Two pairs
produced fifteen young this season, and I have found them to be
more prolific than the Blue-breasted.
Cuban Finch (Phonipara canora ).--I think these pretty little finches
are an acquisition to any aviary, although I would liken their so-called
melodious song to that of a squeaky bicycle. Two pairs reared fifteen
young between them. They appear to be continuous breeders in this
climate. One nest of four young was successfully reared. Three eggs
represent the normal clutch. The colouring of young Cubans, being
almost identical to an adult hen.

268 H. S. Sewell--Breeding Notes from Toorak, South Australia
Olive Finch (.Phonipara lepida ).--Like the foregoing species, they
appear to be very free breeders. Ten young Olives were reared. I have
noticed that these Finches are particularly fond of a little fruit. The
characteristic of the Weaver is in evidence by their strongly woven,
pouched shaped nests.
Black-headed Mannikin (Munia atricapilla ).--I would class these
common Mannikins as difficult to breed, not so much as to the actual
rearing of the young, the difficulty lies in inducing the old birds to
nest and lay, as they possess a very nervous temperament, like the
white-headed variety, although I found the latter even more difficult.
Four white eggs were laid in a strongly constructed, oval-shaped
nest, rather smaller than one would expect for a bird of their size.
Four young were reared. They apparently take a long time to assume
full dress, as I disposed of them at four months, when they were just
showing signs of breaking colour. This species were not given any
special food, but I particularly noticed that the old birds spent most
of their time gorging green seeding grasses in their aviary ; flying-
on to a grass stalk, the bird would bend it to the ground and extract
the seeds.
Beautiful Fire-tailed Finch (Zonaeginthus hellus ).--This family,
I consider, is by far the most delicate of Australian Finches in captivity..
My breeding pair built within their shelter, amongst some gum branches,
a very large loosely made, oval-shaped nest, almost the size of a football.
The entrance was bottle-necked, sloping downwards. These birds prefer
long stems of dried grasses for nesting material. A few feathers were
used for lining ; four white eggs were laid ; incubation occupied
fifteen days from the last egg, when two youngsters were hatched.
Live food was supplied in the form of Termites. These two youngsters-
grew into fine birds when I liberated them into another aviary two
months later. Unfortunately a cat quickly terminated their lives :
however, that part of the business has since been taken care of. I hope-
to do better with Zonaeginthus hellus next season.
Peters' Spotted Finch (Hypargos niveiguttatus ).--A pair of these
beautiful finches was sent to me from England by a fancier last spring,
and I must admit surprised me by nesting a few weeks later. This-
nest, however, proved to be infertile. A second nest in October went-

along very well for a time, when one morning to my astonishment
I found two plump, half-grown youngsters dead on the floor of the
aviary, as were two others in the nest. Both nests were built on a
flat beam in their shelter, protected by bushes. The third nest was
built out in the flight directly on the ground, partly hidden by dried
grasses, oval in shape, and constructed of coco-nut fibre and fine
grasses, and was thickly lined with feathers. Four white eggs were
laid, incubation occupying fourteen days. Four young Peters left
the nest and were successfully reared. The old pair again surprised
me by nesting again in June (mid-winter) : after a lapse of several
months, three more youngsters left their nest, but one apparently
died of cold, and another broke its neck, leaving me with five young
birds for the season. They assumed full colour in two months from
leaving the nest in this climate. These finches are extremely nervous,
especially the young. They also appear to be semi-ground birds,
and with me usually decide to adopt this habit when on the show
bench. This species is very fond of live food.
Orange-cheeked Waxbill (Sporoeginthus melpodus ).--These little
Waxbills have proved harder to breed than the casual fancier might
imagine. They appear to be so very active that they cannot find
time to sit on their eggs. Several surprisingly well-built, oval-shaped
nests were constructed of fibres and fine grasses, directly on the ground.
The entrance is bottle-necked, sloping downwards, but most of these
nests were built just to occupy their time. I have a few pairs of these
Waxbills, and I found when one pair would lay, they would desert
their nest immediately. Eventually I induced a pair to nest amongst
some twigs within their shelter, and observed that when a pair decided
in earnest to incubate, the cock would build himself another very
small nest, directly on top of the main structure. This attic, so to
speak, then becomes his nightly sleeping quarters during incubation.
With reference to the brood that was successfully reared, four white
eggs were laid, incubation occupied twelve days, and later three young
birds left their nest. The body colouring of the young is similar to
the adult birds, excepting the orange ear patches, which are smaller
and very pale, beak black.

Truly the pitfalls and experiences of breeding and rearing Parrakeets
and other birds are many and varied.
This year I had a very fine pair of Red Rosellas. The cock bird
was two years old and the hen one year old. They were in an aviary
with a long flight by themselves. I gave them a grandfather clock
nest-box, and filled this with peat, moss litter, and a certain amount
of rotten wood on the top, which I had seen recommended as a
good thing to use. This pair, after much inspection of the nest, and
continual peering in at the entrance, finally decided to go to nest.
They laid three eggs and the hen disappeared for some time, so I pre-
sumed she was sitting. After a time she reappeared and I frequently
saw her and the cock going backwards and forwards to the nest. This
went on for some time, but then we noticed their journeys ceased.
After watching for some days, we decided to open the box, only to
find three young ones dead. These seemed little doubt of the cause
of their death, as there was besides the young birds a large crawling
colony of quite a hundred earwigs in the nest-box. The young birds
were bitten above their beaks. These plagues had either bitten the
young to death outright, or had caused the parents to desert.
My second most unpleasant experience in this most unpleasant
year was with my pair of Many Colours. The aviary in which they
live is warmed in the winter. It has a long outdoor flight. I have had
a .certain amount of trouble with my hen Many Colours, so had been
extra careful with the one I now have.
We put in the nest-box at the end of April and noticed the cock
and hen were inspecting this. I hoped they might be going to nest.
All looked most promising. Suddenly the hen went absolutely bald
and lost all her feathers on her head except a narrow line of small

feathers straight up from her beak to the back of her neck. She had
no feathers round her eyes and her head was quite bald. This gave
her a most odd appearance. Of course this quite put an end to our
hopes in the way of a nest. Thus my hopes with two lots of my
birds were dashed for this year. I must add that in both cases I applied
to Mr. Seth-Smith for help, not knowing what to do, and he, with his
never ending courtesy and kindness, gave me the best of good advice*
which, of course, I took, with the result that the hen Many Colours-
grew a new lot of feathers, but showed no further sign of nesting.
I hope the Kosellas will profit by his advice next year.
I think all aviculturists owe Mr. Seth-Smith endless gratitude for
the more than kind way he always helps, and this in spite of all the
many things he has to see to in his work at the Zoo. I, for one, am
always most grateful to him.
It may interest our members to know what remedies were proposed
in these cases. As far as the Many Coloured hen was concerned, Mr. Seth-
Smith asked, when communicated with, under what conditions the
bird was kept. I replied that the aviary they were in was slightly
heated and kept as a rule up to 60* and quite dry. His
answer was that possibly the conditions were too dry, and to damp
the floor. We did this, with the result that shortly the lady's head
became covered again with feathers. However, she showed no further
signs of nesting.
With regard to my second sad experience with the Kosellas versus
earwigs. I went to the Avicultural tea party at the Zoological Gardens,
and I talked to some of our members about my experiences and asked
their advice. I was told that I should get some cheap sponges and
put them in beer and sugar and place near the part these plagues are
in. They will then go into the sponges and should be shaken out and
drowned. I have also seen lately in The Times in reference to these most
tiresome insects that carbolic disinfectant poured on the ground,
round whatever it is wished to protect, will preserve it from their
depredations. These remedies I shall most certainly try next year.

These beautiful and graceful birds have nested with me for the
last three years, and although most of the eggs were hatched out each
time, none of the chicks lived longer than a couple of weeks. The
chicks always looked healthy and strong when hatched, but seem
to die suddenly and apparently from no disease. As these birds were
kept in the large animal enclosure the parents used to take the chicks
for long walks all day long and feed them on grasshoppers. I came
to the conclusion that it was a mistake to have the birds in such a
big enclosure. The chicks were not only walked off their legs, but
we were never able to get near enough to feed them. Last autumn
I decided to put two breeding pairs in two separate small pens in my
orchard, and these are the birds that nested and have reared their
young. One pair started sitting on two eggs on the 3rd June, and
one young one was hatched out on the 5th July. The second egg was
unfertile. Being in a small place we were able to feed the birds on
gentles, earthworms, ants' eggs, and mash. The ants' eggs and gentles
were covered over with some earth and the birds worked for them
and got most of the food which otherwise would have been eaten by
sparrows and other birds. After the first week the young one began
to grow visibly and by the middle of August had lost practically all
his brownish down and began to grow feathers like its parents. By
the third week of August the chick was half the size of the parents
and started growing a tail and the head assumed the white colour
of its parents. At the time of writing (7th September) the chick is
a robust bird and is practically reared, eating everything, including
wheat.
The second pair of Stanleys started sitting on 2nd May but both
eggs were unfertile and were removed on 3rd June. They laid two
more eggs and started sitting on 6th July. Two chicks were hatched
on 4th August. Both are doing splendidly and should be reared without
any difficulty.

A third pair that nested on 7th June in the large animal enclosure
had their eggs removed by the end of June, as they were both unfertile.
Stanley Cranes make most devoted parents, and no one is allowed
to get anywhere near their chicks. Two men went into their paddocks
to feed them, as the birds were really dangerous, and would attack
one man if he went alone. Although Stanley Cranes have often nested
and have hatched young, no young ones have ever been fully reared,
and this, I believe, is the first one to be reared in captivity. In my
experience Stanley's are free breeders and most people have had them
nesting and even hatching young, but none have been reared. At
the present moment there is a young one at the London Zoo, which
is three weeks younger than mine and looks like being reared.
I enclose two photographs of the two pairs of Stanley Cranes. One
chick is just over two months old and the others are just over one
month old. I am delighted at last to have reared young Stanley Cranes.
A TAME BULLFINCH
By E. Kathleen Goddard
A short time ago (about two years, I think it was) I purchased
a Piping Bullfinch. He piped two little tunes perfectly and became
extraordinarily tame. Of course, during the moult he was silent;
but when over it to my dismay I found he had forgotten his songs,
and could only remember little bits of perhaps a bar or two, and
although he would sit on his perch and try his very best to get the
whole tune, it generally ended in a disastrous jumble of notes most
painfully out of tune ! Then one day a friend told me that unless
one whistles the tunes the birds have been taught, whilst they are
moulting, they forget them. So (not being able to whistle) I put Bullie
into a room with a Boiler Canary and in a very short time he could
sing exactly like his companion, but the notes were softer and more
mellow. Needless to say I was delighted. This summer I thought
a fly in a big outdoor aviary would be beneficial to my pet, so out
he went, with some Gouldians and other small Finches. I soon, how-
ever, discovered that Bullie did not at all appreciate his change
of air, for every time I went near the aviary he would, fly to the side

and sit and sing his little Boiler song with his absurd little head and
tail on one side and if I entered the aviary, he would perch on my
head, still singing most lustily ! One day a friend suggested that
Bullie should have a wife, and kindly lent me a lovely hen. The pair
were transferred to a larger aviary and were naturally quite alone.
Mrs. Bullie quickly went to nest and laid five eggs. I was greatly
excited although I never saw my bird take the least notice of the
fair lady ; however, when nothing appeared from the nest after she
had been sitting for three weeks I took a look at the eggs and all were
clear ! Mrs. Bullie would, I firmly believe, have been still sitting,
had I not assured her it was useless ! So she was restored to her rightful
owner, and my naughty little bird is now back in his cage, beside his
Canary pal, and is as happy as possible and declares he has no use
for wives or changes of air and much prefers singing his little songs
to me !

Your gesture that notes on " common " birds are wanted I suppose
also means that the " common or garden " members of the Association
may express their views without appearing " clever ". When I go to
the corn dealer I hear so much about cleaned or polished, or double-
polished or cleaned seed that it makes me think. You see, my aviaries
are quite small as things go, are wooden floored, at the top of the
garden, and I have home-made hoppers for the seed and give them
a shake each day so that the seeds scatter on the " dirty " floor and the
dear vulgar birds with such wretched table manners actually appear
to relish the food better from the floor than from the table. I buy
cheap grass seed at 2s. a stone : this I think is nothing more nor less
than stable loft sweepings cleaned and riddled and the birds, despite
the frightful price charged for the cleaned seed I supply, actually
seem again to prefer this stuff. At times I get a sack of these sweepings
unscreened direct from a stable loft and put that in the aviaries and
the birds, " dirty little beggars," and the foreigners are just as bad
as the British birds, seem to revel in this dirty stuff. A friend in the

Midlands at times sends to me what are called screenings. These are
what are left after they have thrashed the corn. At first this stuff
came cleaned, but I asked for it dirty and I will explain why. One
day I was in a common sort of corn shop where they sell corn and
all kinds of feed for horses and two gentlemen came in and took away
in their car some small bags of sweepings and each man gave the
attendant 2s. 6d. When they had gone the attendant explained they
were gentlemen from the University and they wanted the stuff to trace
the insect life. Now I have a friend in Scotland who has a farm, and
for years has caught up wild birds, put them in rough wire aviaries,
and had no end of luck in breeding, and he twice a week gets a shovel
and gathers up a fresh cow " flap " and throws that in the aviary, as
it attracts all kinds of live stock and the birds want them to feed their
young on. I have hard- and soft-billed birds together, and in one aviary
have a Thrush, and there is one Canary which actually scraps with
that Thrush and takes its mealworms from it. I have wee Waxbills
that struggle with mealworms, so that these seeds, all the more if there
is insect life clinging to the seeds, are naturally essential to the food
of the birds. Again, I have a Parrot, this being the only bird in the
house. She is at liberty all day and is mostly on the top of her cage
when in the house. She is taken to the slop stone in the washhouse
under a dripping tap each morning and there is a gardener's saucer
there if she wants a bath, which she takes about three times a week.
Then she is placed on the lawn in the garden, when she invariably
goes to where there is some loose soil and messes up her beak and
feet. Finishes up by climbing a fruit tree and then is brought back
to the top of her cage. So she is a dirty beggar also in her feeding
habits, grovelling in the soft dirt in the garden, but she is in perfect
feather, and does not attempt feather plucking. Incidentally, I have
a tree branch about 15 inches long and about S inch in diameter, which
I keep and she perches on it when being brought to and from her
cage. At one time when I followed the rules of the book and had
all clean and spick and span I had great success in picking up dead
birds each day. Now it is rare and invariably the result of an accident,
and I have definitely come to the conclusion that both British and
foreign birds want dirt to revel in.

The Zebra Finches have produced six beauties--one cock I have
had about five years ; he is still very vigorous--the other pair broke
their eggs. Both hens are now sitting again. The young birds were
so long in making their appearance that I feared the terrible weather
had killed them, but one morning when I opened their aviary door
they were all in a row on the swing with papa, mamma, and the other
hen all sitting behind, looking very excited. About two days later
one was sitting on the door and suddenly found himself swung into
the orchard. He took wing and flew strongly out of sight. Feeling sure
he was lost I was delighted to see some hours later a tiny grey speck
on the roof of the houses, " mewing " piteously. I called and he flew
into an apple tree. I gently drove him towards the aviary near which
I put a large cage where soon he sat down very tired, but would not
enter it, so I put a tiny travelling cage near and he popped straight
in and at once returned to the bosom of his family. Evidently
expecting the prodigal's welcome, he sat crying in the middle of the
floor, but mamma looked coldly at him. However, after a few minutes
she flew down and literally combed him from head to foot with her
beak, going over each leg separately. He crept into the nest, looking
rather crestfallen and was soon asleep. He refused to eat with the
others the next day, and I saw the mother pull his head round and
poke the food down his throat. Hardly three days later I found him dead
with a hole pecked in his head.
The Cordon Bleus are sitting but they are overdue and no sign
of young. Silverbills nesting, but no eggs so far.
Two Half-masked Weavers have a hen Bullfinch for company,
as I was unable to find a hen of their kind. The old cock makes violent
love to her : as soon as she appears in the flight he flings himself in
front of her and sings just like a lemonade bottle bursting ! He sings
in my face, too, and when I applaud he begins all over again. He
only allows the younger cock to present " Bully " with a flower which he
picks up in the flight. She ought to relent to this passionate wooer
as he has built her a most wonderful castle in the air. It swings from

the top of their house, globular, and with the entrance below, but so
far she only looks bored.
My old Nonpareil Bunting used to take mealworms from my hand,
but since he has found a wife and has a home of his own, treats me
rather cavalierly, but he does sing very sweetly late at night. Sometimes
as late as 11 o'clock his sweet, little trilling songs float up from the
orchard through the bedroom window ; it is very delightful.
The Orange Cheeks are sitting in a large cage in the birdroom.
One rattles the door as soon as he sees me and we go to the meal-
worm jar together. After two I say " No more ! " When he picks up
the empty skin and dangles it before me until I have to relent. He
even fetches it from the back of the cage when I am too hurried to
let him out. He knows his name " Cheeky " as well as a dog does,
and searches my fingers and pockets for hidden dainties.
Almost the greatest pets are the Grey-backed White-eyes. They
look for insects hidden in bags, prying open my hand, sure some fat
spider lurks there. They love to bathe in the arum lily leaves and
splash the water all over me or they insist that I hold the china bathing
dish when the arums are over. They too are lovely singers, sitting
very close together ; one seems to take the treble and the other murmurs
a soft little accompaniment. Unfortunately they are both cocks. When
they came to me they were very sticky and their one idea was to
share the three feathers they possessed. Their owner had not under-
stood them, but soon with great care tiny black pin points came out
all over them, and now they are in perfect feather.
" Bonny," my black-headed Gouldian, lives in the vinery and when
anyone comes to see him I tell him to show off, when he at once flies
as quickly as possible round the vinery, but never touches the glass,
comes back, and does a queer little dance on the top of his cage. Every
night he hides in the vine and I pretend to look for him and he always
rushes out in my face when at last I see him and say " Bed now,
Bonny ". He goes into his cage at once. He frets so when I have
to leave him that I think perhaps some day he may be gone when
I return. He is a bird child and knows a great deal. Birds are so
lovable, so interesting, and the study of them and their entrancing little
ways are such a joy. It makes one wonder how anyone can live
without pet birds.

THE AFRICAN BLACK CRAKE
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.98765737037037" page_id="56289826"  page_num="278" year="" vol="">
Gallinula flavirostra Swainson, 1837. Senegal. ( Rallus niger. Gmelin,
1789. Cape. (Not Miller.) Habitat: Tropical Africa.
The first arrival was, I believe, the small lot brought by Gurney
from East Africa in 1908. Delacour had some at Cleres about 1920,
and Gamage imported some in 1926 (see Avi. Mag., 1927, 60). The
Zoo received their first specimen in 1927 (probably from Gamages
consignment) and Webb brought a few more from Portuguese East
Africa in May, 1930, three of which went to Whitley's, where I saw
them in 1931. Since then others have occasionally arrived.
This Crake was bred by Sich in 1930, about six young being reared
from two (? three) nests. See Avi. Mag., 1930, 270 ; 1931, 57, 81
(medal) ; 1933, 106.
I knew this bird well in West Africa, and have kept them occasion-
ally, finding them easy to feed, as they thrived on boiled rice as a staple.
At home they would probably not be so easy as the supply of insect
food, so easy in Africa, where white ants, grasshoppers, etc., are always
obtainable in any number, would be more difficult, but those who have
kept them here could tell us more about that.
Coloured plates of the species are to be found in Swainson's Birds
of West Africa (1927), vol. ii, 244, plate 28 (old, but quite good), and
Bannerman's Birds of Tropical West Africa (1931), ii, p. 14, plate, p. 31.
The name niger used for so long has had to give way to the later
flavirostra on account of preoccupation.
The above was written as an answer to a correspondent, but may be
sufficiently interesting to other readers to permit its appearance here
again.

to be able to report that over 90 per cent of our original members
have renewed their subscriptions and this, surely, gives some indication
that members have been satisfied with our efforts. A very pleasing
feature of the steady influx of new members is that fanciers are joining
from all quarters of the globe : Japan, New Zealand, South Africa,
Australia, and Canada are all well represented now. We were always
anxious that our Society should be world-wide and our ambition is
being fulfilled. America has now her own Society and naturally we
cannot expect many new members from that great country, but we
were all delighted to know that the Society had been formed, although
may I dare to add that we were rather proud of the fact that we were
first in the field.
Interest in ornamental pheasants is increasing at a most happy
rate and, as an instance or perhaps I should say proof of this, it is
interesting to know that at least two well-known manufacturers of
small bird aviaries are now turning their attention to special pheasant
aviaries, these are being designed primarily for pheasants although
provision is made for those who may care to keep small birds as well.
Within the next few months it is quite likely that we shall launch
an intensive campaign. This may sound very militarist but we
intend to be forceful. The Committee feel that there are dozens of
public parks and zoos which do not at present keep ornamental pheasants.
We are going to do our utmost to persuade the authorities of such
parks to keep a few pheasants, we may even arrange to supply them
with a few cocks in order to stimulate their interest. So I think the
O.P.S. is progressing steadily towards the goal for which we were
founded, viz. to foster and increase the interest of our public in orna-
mental pheasants.
CORRESPONDENCE, NOTES, ETC.
I visited recently a friend who has a small collection of Parrot-like birds
and little room for movable aviaries. He had tiled floors for the flights, a
little sand being thrown down under the perches for the sake of greater
cleanliness. The effect was very pleasing ; the birds looked well and had
a good health record and the tiles were cheaper than cement.
Tavistock.
When I kept birds my shelters had tiled floors and I fully agree with
Lord Tavistock as to their convenience and pleasant appearance.--E. F. C.

BENGALESE AS FOSTER-PARENTS.
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.992363244444444" page_id="56289828"  page_num="280" year="" vol="">
In reply to Preb. Sweetnam's inquiry re Bengalese as foster-parents.
Probably my list of successes will be helpful and of interest to others.
Completely reared : Diamond Sparrows, Ruficaudas, Blue-headed Parrot
Finches, Bichenos, Masked and Long-tailed Grassfinches, Yellow-rumped
Serins, Cape Canaries, Green Singing Finches, Zebra Finches, Cuban Finches,
and Gouldian Finches. In the case of Gouldian Finches some of the young
reared under Bengalese do not appear quite so large as those reared by the
Gouldians themselves.
I have also reared many different kinds of hybrids under Bengalese.
I still have a hen Cordon Bleu that was reared by Bengalese. On another
occasion they reared one Fire Finch Wax bill and one St. Helena Waxbill
(large variety).
They have often been called upon suddenly to take a nest of deserted
eggs or young, and in many instances did the work quite successfully.
Just over a fortnight ago a pair of Gouldians were in and out of the nest
continually, when upon examination I discovered the nest contained twelve
eggs. Six of these eggs were placed under a pair of Bengalese who had only
laid two eggs and the other six eggs under a pair who had not even laid an
egg. Both pairs sat well and to-day (September 15th) I find chicks hatched
under both pairs. Another instance of the usefulness of these fosters. Three
days ago a pair of Gouldians suddenly deserted a nest of six eggs which
I discovered stone-cold. These were placed under Bengalese who had laid
three eggs, but they took to the new eggs and now three young have hatched.
My method in this case was to warm the cold eggs in my mouth before placing
under the Bengalese (then have a good rinse out with a mouth wash). Of
course it remains to be seen how many of those hatched I shall rear.
Some of these little Bengalese are truly wonderful foster-parents and
I cannot understand why they are not made more use of. I have tried various
breeds of Canary hens for foster-parent duties but they are not to be com-
pared with Bengalese. Bengalese breed very freely with me. From four nests
of six eggs each they have fully reared twenty-two young.

Our members will hear with interest that Mr. Goodfellow is on his way home
and expects to land in England about the end of September. He writes that
with the exception of a finger-tame Crested Falcon, a few Sunbirds, and four
exquisite Blue-winged Pittas, his stock consists entirely of Pheasants and
four species of Partridges. Of Pheasants he has Reinhardt's, Edward's,
Malayan Peacock (P. malaccensis), and Palawan Peacock Pheasants, Argus
and various Firebacks, including the Siamese.
Mr. Goodfellow intends to stay only a short time in England before
starting again for the East, and hopes to return next spring with fresh
treasures. Everyone will be glad to hear that he has recovered from his
recent severe illness followed by two operations, and hope that he will bring
back more good things next spring.

This beautiful little Finch is well known to all of us, and has bred
freely in captivity, where it seems very well contented and gives
little trouble.
It was first bred in England by Mr. R. A. Todd in 1897. The sexes
are identical in plumage, and there seems to be no certain way of
distinguishing the sex of a given bird. It has been asserted that the
*cocks are slightly larger than the hens, and their central tail-feathers
longer, but this is open to doubt.
In my aviaries this Finch was, generally speaking, inoffensive, but
-could hold its own if another bird tried to bully it, and made itself
respected. It will interbreed with the Parson-Finch, and it is claimed
that the hybrids are fertile.
It is particularly desirable as a show bird, because it is exceedingly
graceful and always keeps itself sleek and in good plumage. It flies
very swiftly, and is usually chary of its song.
Mr. Seth-Smith " found egg-shaped reed baskets, seven or eight
inches in length with a hole at each end, greatly appreciated by this
.and the other G-rassfinches both for sleeping and nesting in, although

the nest is often built among the branches in the aviary without artificial
framework. Grass seems to be the material mostly used."
The Long-tailed Grassfinch inhabits North and North-West
Australia. The young are much greyer than their parents, and have-
black bills and feet.

The most conspicuous bird around the coasts and in fact anywhere-
in Malaya is the beautiful Brahminy Kite ( Haliastur indus intermedins ),
a large Hawk, with the head and breast pure white and the rest of the
body a rich chestnut. Its shrill screaming can be heard throughout
the day and so loud are the cries that in the mangrove swamps where
there are many of these birds, the noise drowns the sound of the smaller
fry. These Hawks wheel around in the sky with outstretched, motion-
less pinions on the look out for any odd bits of meaty refuse or garbage.
Around some of the harbours one sees large numbers of these birds,
though in the larger towns they are decreasing as they form an easy
target for the thoughtless wretch with a gun who makes the excuse
that it is a bird of prey to slaughter it. I doubt if ever these birds
kill anything alive, preferring to live like Vultures on garbage and
carrion at which they are adepts in snatching ofi the surface of the
water with their feet. They will follow ships for miles in the hope
of obtaining meat thrown overboard. The nests of these Kites are very
conspicuous objects on the landscape and are usually built high up
in some lone half-dead or dead forest tree which has been left standing
when the rest of the jungle has been cleared away. Another Kite
sometimes seen in the company of the foregoing is the White Kite
(.Elanus cseruleus). This is a much smaller bird and is only a migrant
to Malaya. Around the swamps, especially at the mouths of the
creeks, one sees small flocks of the lovely Kesident Malay Coast Swallow
(Hirundo javanica anambensis), a long, cumbersome name for such a

small, beautiful creature. Sometimes a pair of Bee-eaters can be
seen consorting with these birds as they hawk for insects low over
the surface of the water. These Swallows appear to be a beautiful
shade of shining steel green on the upper surface but in the dried skins
in museums they appear blue.
In the air about the public parks and in most of the large towns
in Malaya one sees huge flocks of two species of Swifts, one of moderate
size and the other very minute. They fly with incredible swiftness
so that the eye can scarcely follow them in their flight. The larger
bird is the Malayan House Swift (Apus affinis subfurcatus), a bird
very common in most of the towns, especially in Singapore and Johore
Bahru. It builds its nests under the protruding upper stories, often
in the main business streets and often in the bazaars themselves, the
birds flying in and out over the heads of the crowds of customers.
At night the bazaars are shuttered up and the birds are not able to
gain access until sometimes late in the morning. Usually there is a
whole conglomeration of these nests, one being built upon the other,
and owing to each nest appearing to be built in layers they rather
have the appearance of huge wasp's nests.
The other bird, the tiny Eastern Palm Swift (Tachornis battassiensis
infumata), is noted for its extraordinary nesting habits. Robinson, in
his book The Birds of the Malay Peninsula , says : " The nests are
attached to the under surfaces of palm leaves of the loftier species . . .
are composed of the floss of a thistle-like seed, mingled with dark-
winged seeds but with no feathers, compacted with the saliva of the
bird . . . the nest itself is a bisected oval about If inches long by f inch
wide . . . the hollow for the reception of the eggs about OH inch."
One sees huge flocks of these tiny birds flying around the tops of
the huge palms, looking more like a crowd of flies than anything else.
After a rainstorm the birds mount high up in the air until they are
almost invisible.
Another Malayan Swift ( Collocalia innominata) provides the nests
from which the Chinese make their famous " bird nest " soup. The
birds build their nests high up in dark caves and these are reached by
huge scaffoldings of bamboo poles. The nests are very small, about
the size of a baby's hand, and are composed entirely of the birds'

saliva ; they are very thin and brittle and look as though they were
composed of a rough, light-coloured tallow.
The soup, which is supposed to be very nourishing, though I can
hardly see how saliva can be nourishing, looks very much like sago
pudding but tastes quite nice, in fact I grew rather fond of it. I suppose
that other ingredients are added, for the Chinese never seem to serve
up a " straight " dish, most dishes, served amongst the wealthier
Chinese, at least, seem to be a conglomeration of a good many things,
and most of them are extremely appetizing, even Beche-de-Mer.
In the towns in Malaya there is the inevitable Sparrow, but a very
clean and refined edition of our cosmopolitan English bird : it is known
as the Malayan Tree Sparrow. It is not nearly as obtrusive or con-
spicuous as its European cousin and if one is not interested in birds
it would pass almost unnoticed. Another very common bird seen in
the vicinity of the towns is the little White-headed Munia [Munia maja ),
locally known as the " Cigar Bird ", from its supposed resemblance
to a half-smoked cigar, though to me this resemblance appears to be
very remote. In this country, where it is imported in large quantities,
it is commonly known as the White Nun or Mannakin. These little
birds are seen everywhere in small flocks feeding on the ground, where
they pick up small seeds, especially those of the various grasses. They
are most common in the public parks, where the grass is short.
Chasen, in his book Birds of Singapore Island, says, " It goes about
in flocks, and is perhaps most often noticed hopping about on the
grass of lawns not too closely cut, and makes rather a comical figure ;
the little parties jump up when disturbed, and go off like a lot of big
bees or tiny Quail with a straight flight and feeble squeaks. It is
caught in great numbers and is a common cage bird. It feeds on rice
and seeds and makes its nest in reeds or high grasses, laying several
white eggs." These birds are very common in the Singapore bird-shops,
and they can be purchased for a very low figure, somewhere about
10 cents or 3 d. a pair.
The familiar Java Sparrow is another common bird seen in the
vicinity of the towns. Countless thousands of these birds are imported
into the Singapore market from Java, Sumatra, etc. ; one sees cages
packed with solid masses of these birds, there must be thousands in

each cage ; where they all go to seems a mystery, for one would think
that the supply greatly exceeded the demand. Evidently they must
be extremely common in the islands or the species could never stand
the continual drain on its numerical strength. A great many birds
are exported to both America and Europe, but I think a great many
are sent to China, where they are sold as gastronomical delicacies under
the heading of " rice birds
Dyal Birds or Straits Robins ( Copsychus saularis musicus), as they
are locally known, inhabit most of the parks and gardens; they are
very Robin-like in demeanour and are favourite cage-birds, especially
with the Chinese. This bird appears to be much larger than the one
we are familiar with at home which is exported from India. The only
sea birds I saw around the coast of Malaya were the White-fronted
Terns [Sterna albifrons sinensis). These graceful "Sea-Swallows"
skim over the surface of the water, diving every now and then with a
splash as they see some small fish. Graceful as these birds are, their
dive into the water cannot by any stretch of imagination be called
elegant. They seem to more or less throw themselves into the water.
In the mangrove swamps we frequently heard the call of the Whistling
Tree Duck, but we never saw them.
Singapore proved singularly disappointing in its bird-shops. One
hears so much about the bird markets of this city and imagines it a
veritable Eldorado for the aviculturist, one somehow expects to see
all the feathered treasures of the East there, Birds of Paradise, Lories,
Pittas, Pheasants, and many others, but as with many other anticipated
joys the realization is often a sad blow. It was to me (at the time
at least, but not afterwards when I realized how the birds would have
fared), when I found that the main stock-in-trade of most of the bird-
shops consisted mainly of domestic fowls, Ducks, and Java Sparrows !
of course with a sprinkling of other birds. The reason is not hard to
find, for the dealers know little or nothing of the feeding of the birds
and every bird, no matter what its species, is fed on rice in some form
or another. For fowls, Ducks, Parrots, and all other seed-eaters the
ordinary hard paddy rice is given, for frugivorous birds such as Bulbuls,
Mynahs, etc., boiled rice is given, for Lories, Hanging Parrots, etc.,
rice water, mixed with a few drops of condensed milk--if a bird does not

live on rice, well, it just doesn't, that's all. The strange thing is that
most shops sell various foods for birds imported from China, including
very fine dried flies which are really small water beetles ; one can also
buy all manner of seed though, strange to say, not sunflower seed,
though the best I ever saw was in China, the kernels are so large and
nutty that it is used as a kind of hors d'ceuvres, with pumpkin seeds
before a meal. Consequently one never sees such birds as Pittas, Chats,
or the small " Softbills ", even such birds as Lories and Hanging
Parrots gradually languish and die. There were few rarities, and most
of the birds I purchased from the shops were more or less bought more
out of pity than anything else. There were the inevitable cages with
their thousands of Java Sparrows, every perch filled with birds, hundreds
on the floor and still more clinging to the wire sides unable to get a
footing anywhere else, in fact all that one usually sees is a solid wall
of breasts and pink feet as it is impossible to see into the cage. Various
species of Munias or Mannakins are also treated thus. Parrots, no
matter of what size or species, are chained with a heavy wire to a
cumbersome bamboo perch usually only a few inches long. Unfor-
tunately in many cases thick wire is tightly bound round the unfor-
tunate creature's leg so that in time the flesh is chafed away and the
wire rubs on the bare bone. I bought out of pity several of the lovely
Malayan Blue-rumped Dwarf Parrots (Psittinus cyanurus), whose legs
were almost severed by this means of attachment. I never saw Parrots
looking so pathetic. A little larger than Masked Lovebirds, these
wretched birds were chained to bamboo perches about 4 inches long,
which in turn was stuck into a short but thick piece of bamboo, the
top of which, cut just above the joint, served as a cup for the dried rice
upon which these birds were fed. The birds, not being used to captivity,
fluttered as soon as anyone passed and were left most of the time
hanging by one leg to the perch. I never saw any bird looking so sorry
for itself. They looked singularly unattractive in their dull juvenile
plumage, which is dull green, the wing feathers edged with yellow. But
when they have assumed the adult plumage they are very attractive
indeed. The male has the entire head a pale silvery blue, the upper
back sooty black and the lower back and rump violet blue, the wing
feathers are green edged with bright yellow, and under the wings

is a bright red patch ; the lower parts are pale green, fading to blue.
The female is quite different; she has a brown head and is bright
green with a yellow throat and only a small blue patch on the back.
This strange little Parrot is very rarely imported into this country,
why, I don't know, considering how attractive it is. It is supposed
to be hard to keep alive and is said to need a very high temperature.
I found no difficulty in keeping my birds alive, but I fed them mainly
on fruit and green food and never subjected them to a low temperature.
These birds are entirely different from, any other Parrot and are not
closely related to any other member of the order. Their movements
are curiously slow and deliberate, reminding one of a chameleon ; they
appear to have no neck and the beak seems to rest upon the breast.
Little or nothing is known of the wild life of this bird and it appears
to have been very seldom kept in captivity over here. Most of the
birds I purchased seemed to be starving as no doubt they were. I would
like to have purchased the whole lot, but had I have done so their
places would soon have been filled by others. All the birds I saw
were in immature plumage. I do not think that they are often offered
for sale in Singapore : at a certain time of the year a number come in,
but if they are not bought up they quickly die as their delicate con-
stitutions cannot stand the indigestible rice upon which the dealers
feed them. Then there are the Lories ; these, too, are fastened with a
piece of bamboo with two holes in it, one for the birds' legs to go through
and the other for the perch to go through. I purchased three of the
very rare Perfect Lorikeets (Psitteuteles euteles), a small bird from the
island of Timor, mostly bright green, and looking rather like very small
Scaly-breasted Lorikeets, but lacking the yellow marking on the breast.
Unfortunately these birds escaped in Johore. I purchased a couple
of the Jobie Island form of the Black-capped Lory: this has a red
collar which the typical form lacks. In addition to these I obtained
a perfect pair of Scarlet Lories (Eos bornea), also an odd one which
proved to be a great pet, in fact it was the favourite of everyone
on the boat I travelled home on. It loved to crawl all over one, gently
touching one's ears and lips with its brush-like tongue ; it liked to be
laid on its back and have its breast tickled; however, since being
placed in an aviary it has lost a great deal of its tameness. I also

had a very tame Purple-capped Lory and a Scaly-breasted, all of
which arrived home safely. Lories make delightful pets, but their great
drawback is that they are very messy birds and need a great deal
of cleaning out. In one of the shops I purchased some of the exquisite
Long-tailed Parrakeets (Psittacula longicauda) which, in my opinion,
is quite the loveliest of the Palseornis Parrakeets, to which family the
well-known King-necked Parrakeet belongs.
I have seen one or two bedraggled specimens over here but they
could not compare to the perfect specimens I saw in Singapore ; though
quite tame the birds were evidently freshly caught for they were in
perfect condition. Their plumage is unique with its varying greens,
blues, and lovely peach-bloom pink and their very long, whip-like blue
tails. The first bird I secured died of starvation whilst being taken
out to where I was staying in Johore, the wretched bird evidently
having been given no food since it arrived at the bird-shop. Later
on I secured four perfect specimens, two cocks and two hens. These
I left in Johore, but they unfortunately died whilst I was in China.
I do not think the feeding of these birds is properly understood, neither
do they live for any time in the bird-shops, in fact I think most die
of sheer starvation by being given hard, dry rice which they refuse to
eat. This is not surprising, as the birds feed mainly in the wild state
on the blossoms of various forest trees. I believe that the few specimens
which have reached this country have proved to be very delicate.
To get back to the Lories. I was told that in times past huge
numbers of these birds were imported into Singapore from New Guinea
and the Dutch East Indies, but so terrible was the mortality amongst
these beautiful and harmless birds that the administrative authorities
approached the Dutch Government with a view to co-operating with
them in the suppression of the traffic in these birds which were fast
diminishing in their respective islands. So the exportation of these
birds from the Dutch East Indies was stopped, which was a good
thing as the birds, owing to bad feeding and neglect, died off like
flies. I was told that in the old days if one went round to the bird-
shops in the early morning the floors would be covered with dead birds
which were thrown out of the cages and were swept up and often
filled several dustbins outside the shop. Now, the few Lories one

sees are smuggled in. I saw one large crate of Black-caps, all in a
terrible state, every day their number grew less and in a week only
about a quarter of the original number were left.
I was surprised to see a great many Australian birds in the shops,
also African and South American. These, I believe, are brought from
their respective countries by Chinese sailors who do this trading to add
to their meagre wages.
I saw quite a few Swainson's Lorikeets in the shops, these had been
brought by Chinese sailors from Australian ports.
Amongst the rarities which I saw and purchased was a female
Muller's Parrakeet (Tanygnathus sumatranus ) from the Celebes.
There were a few mammals, such as pathetic-looking gibbons, including
some very attractive white and cream ones which I was greatly tempted
to purchase, but knowing to my cost that monkeys and birds do not
mix very well, I refrained. On the whole the bird-shops, which are
owned by the Chinese, and located in the Chinese quarter, are dark
and foul smelling death-traps for the unfortunate creatures which
Fate decrees shall enter there.
The absolute antithesis of all the foregoing was to be found in a
zoological park owned by a Mr. Basapa, a wealthy animal dealer
of Singapore. This " zoo ", which is situated some miles outside of
the city, is in ideal surroundings, and in the spacious aviaries I saw
a galaxy of rarities such that I have not seen for many a day.
Most of the birds were in very good condition. The following are a few
which I can remember : Sarus, Stanley, Crowned, and Demoiselle
Cranes ; various species of Cassowaries ; numerous Malayan Pheasants,
including Bornean and Malayan Argus, Yiellot's, Sumatran, and
Siamese Crested Fire-backs, also Buff-tailed and the rare Crestless
Bornean Fire-backs; there were several of the famous Bulwer's
Pheasants. I was rather disappointed in these, as it was the first
time I had seen them alive. In museum specimens they are made to
look all tail, which when spread is no doubt very impressive, but in
life the tail is held horizontally and folded very compactly, which gives
no idea of its large size ; in size the birds resemble a small and slender
Fire-back. Unfortunately a good many of these birds were maimed,
owing to being caught by the legs in snares, in fact I should think that

80 per cent of Fire-backs and Argus are either killed or seriously maimed
in the catching. The birds are caught with fine nooses and if held
by the neck the bird is soon strangled ; if caught by the legs the struggles
of these large and very strong birds soon dislocate the limbs. I think
there is a great deal of needless cruelty in the trapping of these large
Pheasants and it is a great pity that these attractive breeds cannot,
like the commoner species of Pheasants, be established in this country.
The trouble is that they cannot stand the cold winters in this country
without heat. Also the number of eggs laid in a season by these birds
is very small, especially by the Argus, whose normal clutch is only two,
which is strange considering the enemies these birds have in their
native forest which, before the advent of Man to the forests of Malaya,
swarmed with carnivorous mammals and huge snakes. A bird's egg-
laying capacity is usually regulated by the number of enemies which
prey on certain species ; for instance, such birds as Eagles which
have few or no natural enemies, lay but one or two eggs in a season,
while such birds as Partridges will lay more.
Yet in spite of the small families of the Argus Pheasants, these
were and still are quite plentiful in the forested areas in Malaya. I think
the protective colouring of the female has a great deal to do with the
preservation of this species, for of all the Pheasants her colouring
would render her practically invisible in the dark forests, the wonderful
mottling giving the general aspect of a dark shadow broken up by light
filtering in through the forest leaves.

WATERFOWL AT SOUTH LAKE, WOODLEY

Having two fairly large sheets of water, on which--or at any rate
on one of which--there congregate in winter some thousands of wild
Duck, we had long decided that a few ornamental waterfowl would
provide a welcome attraction, especially in the summer months when
all the Duck, with the exception of a few Mallard, depart. But it was
not until the autumn of 1935 that we actually bought any birds.

And, having bought one or two pairs, it was soon decided to get more,
and then more still; so that by the time of writing we have a fairly
representative collection.
However, before enumerating some of the more interesting water-
fowl on the property at present, it would be as well to give some idea
of the conditions under which they are kept.
Although there are two lakes, the tame birds are only kept on
one, the other being set aside for the winter migrants, and such surplus
stock as we decide in the future cannot be safely accommodated
with the rest of the ornamental birds. The lake on which the birds
are kept, then, is a piece of water of some 20 acres in extent,
surrounded on three sides by rhododendrons, and on the fourth by
a more or less continuous line of reed beds. One end is deep, 18 feet
in places, and the other shallow, for the most part never exceeding
4 or 5 feet, and a good deal considerably less. The bottom of the
lake is a mixture of mud and coarse gravel, with enough mud to ensure
a plentiful supply of insect life, and enough gravel to give the Ducks
anything they need in the way of grit, etc. There are two islands
in it, one covered in grass and the other in loose scrub, as well as an
eminence, which when covered with lumps of pudding-stone, provides
an admirable rocky projection on which the birds can rest. At one
end the lake narrows into a bottle-neck, which is wired off as an enclosure
for new arrivals and young birds. Finally there is an arm, which
consists of a pond, connected with the lake by a cutting. This, too,
is wired off and is useful for quarrelsome males and such in the breeding
season. Surrounding the whole lake and taking in another 70 or
80 acres of rough land (rhododendron, woods, bramble, and swamp)
is a fox-proof wire fence. The birds therefore have nearly 100
acres of all sorts of ground on which they can roam at will. The
soil is light and does not hold the water (a great advantage in time
of hard frost). The one thing lacking is grass ; for, except for the
lawn and a few places round the edge of the lake, there is none at
all. Despite that the Geese and other grazing Ducks do not seem
to suffer any noticeable disability. Why we do not know, but we
suppose they get enough vegetable food of other sorts to keep them
in health.

At any rate, the birds we first purchased consisted of most of the
British surface feeders, Carolinas, Rosy-bills, besides the more com-
monly kept foreign species. Doubtfully we purchased pairs of Pink-
footed, Bar-headed, and Bernacle Geese, and hoped they would manage
without the grass. The one, as one might say, interesting bird, was
a pair of Goosanders, which we believed would be able to make a living
for themselves out of the numerous small fish that live in the lake.
They have fully justified our confidence, for of all the Duck on the
lake at present, none seems so consistently at home ; their diet, I
should say, has always been supplemented by a daily ration of raw
meat, but this is given them, rather to keep them tame, than as a
necessity. We made few additions during the winter, contenting
ourselves with improving the existing facilities ; however, in the
early spring a drake Gadwall, apparently a wild bird--though they
are decidedly uncommon in this district, came and settled with us,
and later on, a drake Garganey (somewhat rare anywhere) also came
and mated with a pinioned bird. Indeed it seems to me that not the
least fascinating part of keeping ornamental waterfowl is the attracting
of wild birds (Pochard, Tufted, and Wigeon), which within a very few
weeks come and feed as if they had been hand-reared on the place.
I suppose this is a commonplace with those who have kept birds for
any length of time, but for me it is still one of the most fascinating
parts of the whole business.
Breeding results this spring were, I believe, in common with many
other people, decidedly poor ; of course, many of the birds had not
by that time settled down, and of those that had, many, such as the
Geese, the Shelduck, and the Wigeon and other Ducks, do not breed
their first year. So that by the end of the breeding season, all we h#d
to show were a few White-eyes, European and American Pochard,
Common and Bahama Pintails, Gadwall, Garganey, Shoveller, Man-
darins, and Carolinas. The Carolinas indeed were more promising
than the rest, some thirty or forty reaching maturity. Many, it is
to be feared, were lost through inexperience, such as a brood of Red-
billed Pintails, which were killed by their mother (a Silky-Wyandotte
cross) which had already been sitting too long. Incidentally, we have
come to the conclusion that, while conditions are as they are at present.

there is no hope of young Duck being successfuily brought up by their
mothers. Jays and Crows in the air, and pike in the water, effectually
kill any ducklings that are not quickly caught up and segregated.
The trouble this year at any rate was that we could not spare sufficient
time in looking for the nests ; no easy matter at the best of times, and
still harder when there is so much cover available ; and diving Duck
at least are pretty well impossible to catch, once they have hatched
and got on the water.
Next year, however, we hope to do much better ; not only will
there be more birds breeding, or old enough to breed, but there
will be better accommodation for them, and, we hope, the weather
will not be quite so miserable.
Since the spring we have acquired a number of new ducks, and
now possess some seventy odd species, numbering about 300 pairs
in all. Some of the more uncommon birds are Cackling, Orinoco,
Semi-palmated, Maned, and Black-barred Upland G-eese, Red Shoveller,
Versicolor Teal, Barrow's Golden-eye, Eider, besides Canvasbacks,
Red-billed Pintails, and the Goosanders which we had originally.
We hope very shortly to be taking delivery of pairs of Harlequin,
Scaup, and Black-billed Tree Ducks. I might also add that we have
tried keeping specimens of the Red-throated Diver and the Common
Guillemot, both of which were received through the kindness of Messrs.
Stevens. Although the diver apparently settled down well, it unfor-
tunately disappeared after a week ; and the Guillemot succumbed
to cold. I am doubtful about Guillemots, but I am sure Divers and
Grebes could be kept with ease, were they once established at a more
favourable time of the year.
In conclusion I should say that next year we hope to keep a certain
amount of Duck full-winged--all our future Mandarins and Carolinas,
most of the British birds, though they most probably will clear off
in the spring, and some of the Geese (e.g. Magellans) and the Tree
Ducks.
By that time, vermin, at present our greatest enemies, should have
been materially diminished.

BREEDING OF THE BLACK-HEADED AND
WHITE-BREASTED CAIQUES
By Lady Poltimore
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99959578125" page_id="56289854"  page_num="294" year="" vol="">
As there does not appear to be a record of the breeding of Caiques
in captivity, I have been ashed to give an account of my pair, whose
sole offspring left the nest about two weeks ago.
I procured my Caiques in the spring of 1931, through the kindness
of our Secretary, Miss Knobel, in whose possession they were at that
time. The cock is a Black-headed Caique, and the hen of the White-
breasted variety. They are a very tame and delightful little pair,
the hen especially being a great pet, and never so happy as when
she is being made a fuss of, and will come on to anyone's hand. The
cock is more nervous, and has been very savage during the nesting
season.
For a year after I first owned these birds, I kept them in a cage,
letting them out for a fly in the room each day, but they are such active
birds that I thought they should have more freedom and exercise,
so in the summer of 1932 I put them in an aviary of which they were
the only occupants. This aviary is heated by hot-water pipes, and
has a garden flight which they use in warm weather, but they are
always shut into the inside portion at night, and in the winter. I have
found these birds very susceptible to cold, and during the time that
they have been breeding this summer, we have often had to give
them artificial heat.
For two years in succession they have laid two clutches of eggs,
incubating them for a month, after which period we have examined
the eggs and have always found them to be clear.
This year they started nesting operations as usual in May (I do
not allow them to have a nest-box earlier than this as our springs are
very late and cold) and the hen laid four eggs, and started incubation.
The hen remained almost entirely in the nest-box, coming out only
to feed, and the male sat on a perch just outside ready to attack any
inquisitive person who ventured too near his nest! Both the gardeners
who clean this aviary and feed the birds have been badly bitten by
him on many occasions. After about four weeks, the gardener examined

the nest, expecting as usual to have to remove the eggs, but to his
surprise he found two young birds about two days old, and two eggs
in the box. Two days later he made another examination, and found
four young birds. After an interval of a few more days he again
examined the nest, and found that the two birds last hatched were
dead, and had apparently not been fed : the first two appeared to be
doing well and growing. I was away from home when the Caiques
were hatched, and on my return I told my gardener to interfere with
the birds as little as possible, as the cock became so frantic if anyone
approached his nest that I was afraid he might do the young birds
harm in his agitation.
When we again examined the nest two or three weeks later, we
found that one bird was twice the size of the other, and I feared then
that they would not be successful in rearing the smaller one, as the
larger bird seemed to be getting most of the attention and food. The
cock seemed to be doing most of the feeding, and was untiring in
his efforts. The smaller bird lived for about six or seven weeks, but
it did not thrive or grow, and it died. It was fully feathered, resembled
the hen (a White-breasted Caique) in plumage, but was very small.
The surviving bird remained in the nest for about 2J months, and when
it eventually left it for the first time, it was as large as its parents
and quite strong on the wing. We watched it for a long time peeping
through the entrance hole at the world outside, before it decided
eventually to come out. It still spends a good deal of its time in the
nest-box, coming out to feed and fly about with its parents, but if
anything alarms it, it quickly scuttles back into the nest-box again.
The three always sleep in the nest-box together.
The young bird now feeds itself, but it will not yet touch any hard
food, and lives on soaked biscuits, soaked sunflower seed, and fruit.
I saw it to-day for the first time, attempting to eat a small piece of
a walnut. While they were rearing their young, I provided the old
birds with soaked biscuit, soaked sunflower seed, and white oats,
besides their usual dry seed mixture, and they ate largely of the two
former foods. I also tried them with Trower's Cecto, damped, and
mealworms. The Cecto they did not touch, but they ate greedily as
many mealworms as they could get. I also provided them with unlimited

fruit, such as pears, oranges, grapes, and apples, all ripe, also walnuts,
as they are especially fond of these.
The young bird is exactly like the male in plumage (a Black-headed
Caique), except that his thighs are green like the female, and he has
more, of her salmon colour at the back of his neck. At a distance,
it is difficult to distinguish him from his male parent, and his colour
and plumage are as good as that of the adult pair. I think he is a
male, as he is much more pugnacious than the hen, and I have seen
him attack her when she is feeding from the same dish. He is very
tame and allows us to pick him up and handle him, but is frightened
of strangers.
I hope if these birds breed again next summer to be able to give
a, better account of the exact time of incubation, but as I was away
from home when they hatched and also afterwards, I was not able
to make any notes, and my gardener did not keep any records.

By E. M. Lupton
It was in a shop in London I saw him, slim and graceful, sleek
and trim, gorgeous in his crimson garb, flirting his wings and his long
slender tail, and taking an inquisitive interest in everything around
him. Home he came, and Reuben he was called. After a while very
cautiously he was introduced to the aviary--in a disused billiard
room--with its mixed collection of some thirty foreign birds, both
larger and smaller than himself. But out again he had to come, and
quickly too, for obviously death was going to result, either by murder
on his part, or from heart failure from sheer terror at the look in his
fiery eye. So in a double breeding cage Reuben took up his abode,
where his beauty and his friendly ways were a delight to all.
Presently a wife was procured, more sober than Reuben in her
brown dress, but with vivid touches of brilliant red, and " Ruby "
was her obvious name. For some weeks love-making progressed on
\0x25A0cave-man lines. When shut apart, Ruby would clamour for a peep

at her beloved, and vainly try to find a way through, the dividing
door. When together, Reuben, with head feathers raised and wings
outspread, would drive her round till she fled in terror to a corner,
and her pursuer was once more shut away. Obviously, if they were
to breed, these was nothing for it but to wire off a portion of the aviary,
where they could set up house. This was done, and they were given
a compartment some 5 feet square by 9 feet high, with a good twiggy
branch for perching and a pile of heather fixed up in the corner to
make inviting cover.
No sooner were they installed than peace reigned. Before long
a home was being built of odds and ends of seeding grass, and presently
the curve on their crumpled tails proclaimed that both parents were
sitting. Shortly young were heard in the nest and hopes ran high.
Besides providing a perpetual supply of gentles and mealworms, plants
were ransacked for green-fly and corners for spiders. On 12th May
five dusky little birds precipitated themselves from the nest, strong
on the wing, perpetually hungry, a credit to their parents. So proud
was Ruby of her performance that she decided to show what more
she could do, and without delay went to nest again.
On 26th June another five poured forth from the same little nest,
equally flourishing apparently, without such diligent supplies of
green-fly and such anxious care.
The area was now becoming congested, but still perfect amity
reigned, and Ruby once more went to nest. By degrees, however,
the elder sons were showing signs of adolescence, donning crimson
waistcoats and raising their voices in imitation of their father's dainty
little trill. Reuben felt their presence was becoming a nuisance, and
early in August all ten were removed to a roomy cage.
On 6th August another five infants braved the outside world, but
one was only feeble, and unable to face an active life. The other four
were well grown and vigorous as ever.
This, I thought, will do. Ruby shall now rest on her laurels. For
a fortnight I should be away from home, and on my return would
break up the colony. But no ! Ruby thought otherwise. While still
hard at work filling four hungry gaping mouths, a new little nest
was constructed a foot or so below the discarded home, which was

This Tanager is popularly known here as vieilloti : whether this
is correct I am not sure. It belongs to a group which comprises vieilloti,
mexicana, and flaviventris from Trinidad, Northern Brazil, and Guiana,
media from Venezuela, boliviana from Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombo, and
Peru, and brasiliensis from South-Eastern Brazil. All of them were,
until the last year or two, very rare in captivity.
I had brasiliensis at one time, a duller colour above, and quite
white below. Mr. Ezra has boliviana, perhaps the gem of the series.
Vieilloti or mexicana, the subject of these notes, is, when first imported,
very bright sulphur yellow below, bright blue to almost black above,
the wings, which are black, show a greenish tinge, and there are two
very bright shoulder patches ; the yellow fades a good deal in captivity.
I acquired my pair, which came I believe from Trinidad, in the
winter of 1934 ; first the hen, quite a youngster just beginning to show
colour; later came the cock, a very fine fellow, larger, especially in
head, bolder in mien, and as the sexes are alike I hoped I had secured
a true pair and so it turned out.
They never fought, but during the winter months I saw no courtship
whatever. In late May they were turned out into a large planted
aviary. Whenever I watched, they appeared to be unconcerned.
I did, however, once catch the cock feeding the hen; they never seemed
to emerge from any nest, until one day, when I produced mealworms,
there was intense excitement! the hen snatched one, and flew into a
wooden travelling box fitted with a small shallow basket, in the corner

of the aviary about 4 feet from the ground. Never had they been
seen there before, but now both were quite brazen about it, and con-
stantly flew in carrying mealworms. I was mystified, but continued
to supply these and fresh ants' eggs besides fruit, insectivorous food,
and nectar.
This state of things continued for several days, when I began to
smell a bad smell from the nest; the feeding continued, however, until
one morning there was a strange quiet--'the birds were sitting listless
on their old favourite perch. On looking round I found a nestling
dead on the ground, about twelve days old, yellowish white legs,
feet, and beak, blue-grey flights, and whitish below.
The nest was shallow and round, made of tiny pieces of very soft
hay and small feathers. The egg I never saw, so cannot describe.
This happened in late August: very soon the weather became cold
and I brought the birds in, and placed them in an indoor aviary.
They were still in breeding condition, the hen attempting to make
a nest here, there, and everywhere with no results.
In late May this year I again turned them out in the same aviary.
They began well, when one sad day I found the hen dead, so ended
my chance of breeding this very beautiful Tanager.

Breeding notes on my birds for this very wet and unsummerlike
summer may be of interest to members. In a small outdoor aviary
a pair of Diamond Doves have done well, having four nests at regular
intervals and hatching and rearing eight young birds. Sharing this
flight was a cock Bibbon Finch and a hen Zebra Finch, which had
paired up together. However, early in the season the Zebra escaped
in spite of a " safety " porch. This porch was soundly constructed
with the front and door of \ in. netting. Nobody noticed, until the bird
escaped, that in a fit of absent-mindedness the top had been covered
with 2 in. netting through which the hen Zebra had not the least
difficulty in passing and was quickly lost to view. The Cut-throat did

J. C. Bennett--Breeding Notes
not seem to notice the absence of his mate but devoted all his time
to watching the Diamond Doves. He spent most of his time on the
highest perch in the flight and immediately the Doves left the nest
would immediately fly down to the nest and brood the eggs or young
Doves. This performance was repeated daily and for each of the nests
and he could be seen brooding two young Doves each as large as himself.
His usual attitude was to stand between the birds with his wings
outstretched over them. When the Doves returned to the nest he
would retire to his perch at the top of the aviary. Even when the
young Doves had left the nest he would sit between them on the
perch, but directly there was another clutch of eggs he returned to
his self-imposed task of brooding the eggs directly the parents left
them. It is interesting to conjecture what might have been the
result if the hen Zebra had not escaped. I have never come across
such a display of the paternal instincts in these birds before and it
would be interesting to hear if other members have.
Zebra Finches, Cubans, and Long-tailed Grass Finches have bred
without any fuss or trouble, although the first-named have not been
as prolific as usual. Of the other Doves, the Emerald-spotted and
the Tambourines have made no attempt to breed. A pair of Carolina
Ducks, although they had a pen to themselves, made no attempt
and never went near the box--made to look as natural as possible
--but in this case I think this was owing to the fact that I had to
go through their pen to attend to a pen of Golden Pheasants and the
Ducks were disturbed. This arrangement--or want of arrangement--
will be altered in future, and as the Carolinas are much steadier now
I hope for better results next season. In August I obtained a pair
of young Mandarins, 1936 birds, and these have quickly become tame
and come running for scraps directly I approach. These small pens
are ideal for taming nervous birds and my method is to enter the pens
as quietly as possible and stand quite still until the birds have settled
down and then attend to their wants without any bustling movements.
I found this worked well with about twenty young Golden Pheasants,
and they are now quite tame, although these birds seem to sense
immediately you enter the pen, however quiet you may be, that you
have come to catch some of them, and their tameness vanishes imme-

diately. Come back again later to feed them and they know, in some
uncanny way, and are as quiet as ever.
A pair of Jamaican Ground Doves, obtained rather late in the
season, raised my hopes by showing signs of nesting. An ordinary
Pigeon pan was placed in their aviary with a few bits of grass and
straw arranged so that a few pieces drooped gracefully over the edge
and after a few days the cock bird was obviously interested and
repeatedly drove the hen towards the nest. For weeks nothing happened
and then the hen was seen to be sitting, the cock taking his turn on
the nest. Two eggs--rather large and white--were laid, but I discovered
that the birds sat steadily during the day but spent the night side
by side on a perch in the outside portion of the flight. This method
of incubation, as might have been expected, did not result in the eggs
hatching, and I am afraid it is now too late in the season to expect
any results, but there may be a chance as in the next aviary a pair
of Indian Green-winged Doves have been steadily producing young
ones since last February.
Three pairs of Pekin Robins, each in a separate flight, have done
nothing. At one time my hopes were raised by noticing the hen of the
best pair carrying pieces of dried grass about, but that was as far
as matters went.
Last year a pair of Pileated Finches, although they had a flight
to themselves and everything that I could imagine they would require,
made no attempt at breeding. The cock, always in perfect plumage,
was found dead one morning. This year the hen Pileated seemed
attracted by a cock Indigo Bunting so they were placed together.
At first they kept at opposite ends of the perches and later were seen
feeding side by side, but that was as far as matters progressed and
at the present time the Bunting is going out of colour. Back in
June I was moving cautiously down the garden one night to listen to
the Nightingale and soon after taking up my position under some
trees the song began, first as a sleepy twitter and then becoming
stronger. Returning to the house by another path I found that the
" Nightingale " to which I had been listening was my Indigo Bunting.
Perhaps the influence of moonlight and a lovely June night added
fco the glamour of the song but it was very beautiful. I do not recollect

By F. E. Matthews
To have success with foreign bird-rearing in our wayward climate
one must be a person " of hope and forward-looking mind I deem
those who tried their prentice hand in 1936 need the type of " hope "
described by Pope, " which springs eternal in the human breast ! "
This spring I started to group together in an aviary those little birds
most likely to agree--taking advice from seasoned breeders. However,
the close confinement to barracks caused by the daily showers seemed
rather to upset the general morale. Everyone seemed to get in some-
one's way ! Things improved when the Silverbills were removed from
proximity to White Javas and Diamond Doves. The eggs laid by the
Silverbills were so numerous that one wondered if both birds were hens.
At all events, they enjoyed sampling every nest indoors and out. A
smartly tailored pair of Orange Cheeks proved just as bad in the matter
of interference in the affairs of a pair of Zebra Finches in a smaller
aviary. The Orange Cheeks never seriously set up house, while the
Zebras sampled each box until the Orange Cheeks left, when they
annexed the small cone-shaped basket intended for the others. Cordons
and Orange Breasts close by, though in great form, agree they won't
be bothered with housekeeping.

In another aviary Ribbon Finches, Bengalese, Silverbills, and
Combassons seem all great friends together. The Ribbon Finches are
mildly interested in boxes under cover, and when the sun shines inspect
those in the open. The little courting song fades out, however, as soon
as Jupiter Pluvius again obscures the landscape.
Amongst the birds the Blue Ribbon must be awarded to a pair of
Diamond Doves. Seldom have I met such fine examples of constancy
and endurance. They have a house and small wire enclosure to them-
selves. They made their nest in an old wire sponge basket, which has
been attached to the wire netting, holding seeding grasses. No box
or tray under cover appealed to them, though the house is open to the
air on one side. Through all the stormy nights and driving rain this
pair have taken it in turn to cover the eggs. The two sitting together
when the weather was worst. They have reared two fine youngsters.
Needless to say, we provided shelter lest the nest should be swamped.

By J. M. Grant-Ives
The autumn and winter bird shows will soon be with us. The
O.P.S. have launched a campaign in connection with these. The
Committee feels that the very best way to bring Ornamental Pheasants
before the public is to show them at the big centres. We have had
many difficulties to surmount, one of the most difficult being the
provision of suitable show pens, and also baskets for the transport
to and fro.
We have now purchased some thirty specially designed pens, and
many baskets: these have cost us a considerable sum of money, but
we are confident the outlay will be merited.
The O.P.S. has met with the greatest courtesy from the Committees
of all the shows concerned. We shall during the next few months be
showing Pheasants at Glasgow, Bradford, Doncaster, Newport, Norwich,
Nottingham, Bristol, and London. In all cases the O.P.S. have been
permitted to appoint their own judges, and M. Delacour has promised

Mrs. K. Dr alee--Breeding Violet-eared Waxbills
to judge at the Crystal Palace Show. Mr. J. C. Bennett, a member
of the Avicultural Society, has had the responsibility of arranging all
matters in connection with the showing of Pheasants, and he has
naturally kept in touch with me and the Committee. There is a
great deal of detail work to cope with, and the Society should feel
grateful to him for all he has done.
Now that we have made all our arrangements, we can only hope
that individual members will support these shows in a whole-hearted
manner.
Apart from the showing of Pheasants the Committee are doing
everything in their power to foster the culture of Ornamental Pheasants.
We are producing writing-paper which will bear a coloured plate of
a Golden Cock : this will be quite small but an elegant design, and
every member will have an opportunity of buying some of the paper
with their full address printed. Naturally we have to make a nominal
charge, but we are inclined to think that this will prove a popular
undertaking.
Perhaps some members of your Society may be interested, if so
I shall be very pleased to forward particulars. We have also bought
two volumes of Beebe's Pheasants , their Lives and Homes. These
books will be sent out on loan to any member who cares to write
to me for them, a small sum being charged. I point out a few of
our activities so that your members may see that the O.P.S. is actively
engaged on the purpose for which the Society was formed, viz. to bring
before our public the desirability of keeping Ornamental Pheasants.

Our member, Mrs. Drake, Mylor, Falmouth, has succeeded in
breeding Violet-eared Waxbills. The two young birds left the nest
and lived to be independent of their parents, but both unfortunately
perished during Mrs. Drake's enforced absence from home. I give
Mrs. Drake's account of the occurrence as sent in her letters, and
hope that she will write a detailed description for publication in our

E. Iiojpkinson -- Mr. Sewell&apos;s Breeding Record 305
In her letter dated the 31st August, Mrs. Drake wrote as follows :
" I had a little parcel on Saturday (29th August), and it contained
a Violet-eared Waxbill (young), also my daughter wrote saying she
found both young birds dead on Friday evening. They were seven
weeks old, might have been more, as the disturbing of the nest is not
possible with foreign birds. Before leaving home on the 20th July,
I felt two very big and strong birds in the nest. On the 10th August
my daughter saw them sitting on a bush, and said they looked quite
old, not as young birds usually do. They were probably a month in
the nest before leaving it, as my Cordon Bleus when not disturbed
do, and then fly out looking very like their parents."
Mrs. Drake wrote again on the 13th October : " The young bird
had so much bright blue on its back, and its beak changing from black
to red, that I think my dates were wrong, as seven weeks is rather
early for that type of bird to have colour like that." \
Mrs. Drake's last letter is dated the 16th October : " The baby
Violet-ears had been feeding themselves for the last fortnight, my
husband saw them daily."

The breeding successes Mr. Sewell of South Australia describes
in the October number (p. 266) make a great record and the whole is
of particular interest to me as I have seen his collection.
I here attempt to compare his single season's successes with what
other records there are.
Taking Mr. Sewell's order the species bred are :---
Melba Finch.-- Five young reared from three nests. I have
record of two previous successes (1) Willford in the Isle of Wight in
1915 and (2) a German one in 1927, and I do not think there are many
others.
Bronze Mannikin.-- " Very prolific ; one pair reared eighteen
young," says Mr. Sewell. Have been bred a good many times and have
been found easy by others. Neunzig says that one breeder reared them
to the fifth generation.

E. Ho&apos;phinson -- Mr. Sewell&apos;s Breeding Record
Cordon-Bleu.-- " Two pairs reared fifteen young." Were first
bred in France before 1859 and often since both at home and abroad,
but it is not easy to rear the young.
Cuba Finch.-- Two pairs also reared fifteen young with Sewell.
Everybody who has had them found them easy to breed. The first
breeder appears to have been Dr. Buss in Germany about 1880 and
Hawkins the first in the United Kingdom in 1899.
Olive Finch.-- " Ten reared." Have been bred elsewhere easily,
the first record of success being before 1880.
Black-headed Mannikin.-- Four young reared of this " difficult "
Mannikin. This I think is the real triumph of the series, for although
everyone has kept these birds without any difficulty and often for years,
the only attempts at successful records which I know are Neunzig's
statement that they were bred by Dr. Russ and a record in Bird Notes ,
1912 and 1913, where Dr. Easton Scott describes success for which the
F.B.C. Medal was awarded. In spite of this award there was great
doubt as to the reality of this " success ".
Fire-tailed Finch, Zoneeginthus bellus. -- Two young reared till
old enough to be removed to another aviary, but were then unfortunately
killed by a cat. Have been bred before in Australia, but I do not think
elsewhere.
Peters' Spotted Firefinch.-- Four reared from two nests. Mrs.
Drake in Cornwall was the first breeder in 1935, and has repeated her
success since, I think.
Orangecheek Waxbill.-- Three young reared. Another case of
success with " difficult birds ", for difficult everybody who has tried
to breed them has found them. Neunzig says " occasionally bred,
first by Dr. Russ ", and there are a few recorded successes in the United
Kingdom, the first being Miss Alderson's in 1901 ; she managed to,
rear one young bird out of four hatched.
Mr. Sewell is indeed to be congratulated on his record and from a
bird-breeding point of view on living in a warm place, where live food
in the way of white ants, a curse to everyone but a bird breeder, seem
always available.

Bird Migration. By A. Landsborough Thomson. 5s. net.
Publishers : H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High Holborn,
W.C. 1.
The why and wherefore of bird migration is one of the most
interesting problems in natural history, and one of the most difficult
to solve.
This little book gives a simply written account of the subject,
starting from ancient beliefs such as the supposed hibernation of
Swallows in the mud at the bottom of ponds, and later describes the
modern methods of study, marking individual birds, etc.
The directions of migration, its seasons, speed, and altitude by day
and night, with particular reference to the movements of young birds,
are carefully given in detail, and examples are cited from many parts
of the world including the Southern Hemisphere, also of the journeys
undertaken by purely tropical species.
The reasons for, and purposes of, migration and its original causes
are fully gone into, including the great question, how do migrants,
particularly young birds making the journey for the first time and
apart from their elders, find their way ?
The book is illustrated with photographs giving bird's-eye view
of coastline, showing bird traps and the ringing of birds, etc. It also
contains maps and diagrams of " recovery localities " and principal
directions of migration to and from the British Isles in autumn. Those
who wish a fuller statement are referred to the author's earlier and
larger Problems of Bird Migration , and papers published by him in
The Ibis .

Songs of Wild Birds. By E. E. Nicholson and Ludwig Koch.
Published by Messrs. H. F. and G. Witherby, Ltd., 326 High
Holborn, W.C. 1.
Several attempts have been made in recent years to secure
gramophone records of the songs of birds in several countries, and
here Mr. Witherby has published the latest and most successful attempt
made by Messrs. Koch and Nicholson, working in conjunction. Their
book not only describes the songs and their singers, but includes records
of the songs themselves made from wild birds singing in freedom.

Correspondence
The value of this innovation will be plain to everyone, for one
hearing of the natural song will do more to help students aud those
interested in birds to identify them by their song than pages of the
most careful and graphic description.
This is the pioneer publication in this branch of ornithology.
Mr. Nicholson is one of the foremost makers of bird censuses, witness
his excellent review of the Heron population, and he has broken new
ground here which is likely to be the forerunner of many similar
undertakings. The records which are sent out with the book include
the Nightingale, Cuckoo, Robin, Wren, Willow Warbler, and others,
and his book is valuable also for his recognition of the many causes of
song and his deductions and apt observations.
Mr. Koch is responsible for the actual recording, and was given
facilities for his work by Mr. Julian Huxley in the wild bird sanctuary
at Whipsnade. Altogether, the songs of fifteen British species of birds
have been obtained, and if worthily reproduced give a really correct
impression. Mr. Huxley contributes the foreword.
The publishers, Messrs. Witherby, are well-known pioneers in bird
study. They are, if not absolutely the inventors of the craft of bird-
ringing, at any rate among its foremost exponents and practitioners.
Students all over the world will owe them a debt of gratitude for this
publication of a book with sound illustrations.
The book is issued in a box, which also contains the underlying
gramophone records. Its price is 15s. net.

Madam,-- Mr. Ezra in his account of his success with these Cranes (p. 273)
says that he believes his young birds are the first to have ever been fully
reared in captivity. According to Crandall's list in the New York Zool.
Society Bulletin, 1917, p. 1449, they were bred in the U.S.A. (before 1917)
and the young presumably reared, as is stated to have been the case with
all the species included in that list. This record appeared as No. 653 in

These birds were bred for the first time in the United Kingdom by
Mr. Reginald Phillips, who published an account of his success in the
Avicultural Magazine for 1902, and was awarded the Society's
Medal. Three young were reared in a bulky bottle-shaped nest with a
side entrance made of grasses usually gathered green, lined inside
with fine grasses and feathers, and fixed in a forked stick. The eggs
.are pointed oval, surface slightly glossy, pure white in colour. They
kept their young so closely hidden that it was not until the 20th July
that he knew for certain young had been reared. The immature
birds may readily be distinguished from the adults by their black
bills and generally duller colouring, but chiefly by the absence of the
red-brow stripe.
On the 1st August, Mr. Phillips noticed one young bird showing
Ted on the brow, and by 10th September all three were coming into
colour. The account does not say if any special food was supplied to
the parent birds.

By R. and N. Stevens
For many years it had been our ambition to fence in an area of land
containing a large lake, so that it would be possible to keep many
species of waterfowl. The idea was that they would breed, and that
many of the young birds would be allowed to grow up full-winged, so
that in time our sanctuary would call to mind the halcyon days of long
ago, when wild Ducks, Geese, and Swans were really numerous in this
country.
Lately it has been our good fortune to see our ideals materialize
here in Shropshire, after many months of searching for a suitable place.
The lake is river-shaped, which is a distinct advantage, as although
it is 40 acres in extent, all the birds can be easily seen by walking along
the water's edge. It lies from north to south, and a belt of trees protects
the whole length of its eastern side. Round the lake 160 acres of park
are enclosed by fox- and otter-proof fencing, and the enclosure is
divided into three areas by fences which follow the line of bridges over
the water. In the south enclosure lies the house and garden. In the
north enclosure a spruce wood flanks the western shore. This wood is
intersected by canals leading from the open water, and so the place
is ideal for the wintering of Tree-Duck, some of which cannot stand
exposure to hard frost.
At our last home in Worcestershire we used to keep the waterfowl
on what might be called the intensive system. The ponds were
insignificant in size and so were extremely crowded. When the time for
emancipation came it was rather an undertaking catching up all the
birds, of which there were about twelve hundred, and many wet hours
were spent in trying to outwit the divers, which quietly sank and joined
the fishes under the water when chased. However, in the end every
bird was caught and safely transported here by road.
In addition to stock birds for breeding we put on the lake a few
hundred waterfowl which had been reared the preceding summer
and left full-winged, that is to say they had not been pinioned but had

R. and N. Stevens--A Sanctuary for British and Foreign Waterfowl 311
had the ten flights of one wing clipped. There were Shoveler, Wigeon,
Gadwall, Pintail, Shelduck, Chiloe Wigeon, Carolina, Mandarin,
Falcated, Ruddy Shelduck, Bahama Pintail, Cinnamon Teal, Red-billed,
Black-billed, and Wandering Tree-duck, Red-crested Pochard, Rosy-
bills, and Canadian and Grey-lag Geese.
We had been careful to erect the fencing in such a way that it was
unnoticeable, in other words there were no visible boundaries to prevent
our birds clearing off altogether. Turning out in these circumstances
such rarities as Red-breasted and Emperor Geese, Rajah Shelduck,
and North American Ruddy Duck provided a delightful feeling of
recklessness.
For the next ten weeks all our new-found pleasure was blighted
by the depredations of an otter, which we discovered to our horror
had managed to get enclosed, apparently j ust before the completion of
the last few yards of the 3J mile fence. In the end he was caught, after
killing 150 duck. To-day he looks a beautiful beast in his glass case
in the office, although at times we feel like throwing an ink-pot
at him.
Last winter many wild Duck came to visit us. There was a flock of
about forty Tufted, the same cf Pochard, also Mallard, Wigeon, Teal,
Pintail, Shoveler, Goldeneye, and one Whooper Swan, besides numerous
waders, a Black Tern, and an invasion of Crossbills. It was interesting
to note how quickly they realized they were in a sanctuary, and very
gratifying to be able to walk past the Ducks as they sat on the water
only a short distance away. Two pairs of Tufted remained to breed.
When the nesting season came round it was extremely interesting
to observe the places most favoured by the fowl for this purpose. The
islands were in great demand, and there was a considerable amount of
skirmishing for their possession, which ended in their being used by the
Geese and larger Shelduck. Actually there was no serious fighting in
spite of the fact that people prophesied disaster when we turned out such
cantankerous birds as Cereopsis, Andean, Magellan, Spurwinged,
Egyptian Geese, and different species of Shelduck. It is true that at the
feeding hour some of the smaller ducks occasionally receive a jab in
the back, but at all other times the species separate and go their

312 R. and N. Stevens--A Sanctuary for British and Foreign Waterfowl
separate ways. Bad tempers seem to be engendered only by conscious
confinement. Except for the tree-nesters, practically all the Duck
nested in long grass, avoiding heavy cover, as was expected.
The next thing we looked forward to w~as the moult, when many of
the fowl lost the stumps of their cut flight-feathers and grew whole
flights in their place. By the middle of August many Ducks were flying,
and the excitement reached its climax when a dozen Grey-lag Geese
spread their wings in the recovery of their full powers. Now we have
great flocks of waterfowl which can fly. There is nothing to prevent
their clearing off altogether, of course, so it is very gratifying to find
them sufficiently fond of the place to make it their home.
One of the greatest pleasures is to see a bunch of foreign Duck flying
high over the house, and calling in voices which would be unfamiliar
to a home naturalist. Thus when half a dozen Buddy Shelduck, by
their audible muttering, compel us to look skywards, or Chiloe Wigeon
call excitedly as they rush headlong for the lake, one experiences that
same delightful thrill which is ordinarily reserved for those rare occasions
when sighting vagrants to these shores.
Probably the best time to see the fowl in flight is at the evening
feed. Then they gather in from all parts of the lake and nearby ponds
and streams, of which, happily, this estate has more than the usual
share. There are times when the sky seems to be full of Duck, flocks
crossing and re-crossing, and then again one hears the sigh of falling
birds and the swish of extended feet braking on water.
Now that the Mandarins and Carolinas can fly we get more accurate
glimpses into their private lives, such as they would be living in their
native homes of China and North America. It is a very pretty sight to
see them just now, perching freely in the oak-trees, feeding on acorns.
A Mandarin drake on a twisted branch within a frame of dried autumn-
tinted leaves is a lovely picture, and a powerful reminder of expensive
fire-screens.
Another very enjoyable aspect of a bird sanctuary is that it is not
only a great attraction to birds, wild and tame, but a great draw, a
meeting-place, for people with kindred interests. A few weeks ago
we had the great pleasure of seeing M. Delacour's world-famous
collection of waterfowl in France. We were frankly envious of many

HONEY-EATERS
By Dr. E. Hopkinson, C.M.G., D.S.O., M.A., M.B.
The Meliphagidae, an Australasian family of nectar-eaters, make
good cage or aviary birds and now that their feeding is better under-
stood are found to do quite well in captivity. They are never common,
but are much less rare nowadays than formerly, when the main idea
of feeding them was sugar-water with the natural result, early end.
The following list contains those which have been imported as far
as I know, and it attempts to give some idea of the avicultural status
of each species.
White-naped Honey-eater, Meliihreptus lunatus (Vieill).--Has
been in the Zoo (No. 595 of Low's List, 1927) and also at the Berlin
Zoo. This and the next are Australian.
Strong-billed Honey-eater, M. validirostris (Gld.).--Has been
at the Amsterdam Zoo, teste Neunzig.
Waigiou Honey-eater, Myzomela eques (Lesson and Garnot).--

Cardinal Honey-eater, M. cardinalis (Gm.).--Mayer and Good-
fellow brought four from the New Hebrides in April, 1934. The Zoo
kept one, the others went elsewhere. Mrs. Shearing exhibited one at the

alive in 1936. I have seen a good many in Australian aviaries and they
seem really to thrive in captivity.

cluded in the Zoo Australian collection, 1908. These two and the next
twelve are all Australian.
Warty-faced Honey-eater, Xanthomiza phrygia (Shaw).--Zoo.

to ever come again owing to export regulations and increasing rarity
in New Zealand.
" Tui," Prosthemadura novaeseelandiae (Gm.).--Zoo. No. 607. Once
quite commonly imported and did well in confinement. I can remember
that Zache, the bird-dealer in Great Portland Street, often had them
about 1890 or earlier. Rare now in New Zealand except on the

which . . . lived to reach the Berlin Zoo in 1901. One was still alive in
1913." This species inhabits New Britain ; N. n. novaeguineae (Muller)
from New Guinea and Waigiou has not yet been imported, I think.
Silvery-crowned Friar-bird, N. argenticeps (Gld.).--Zoo. No. 615.
Payne and Wallace brought four in 1908 and three of them were still
alive in 1913 (B.N., vii, 97 ; 1913, 208). In 1920 there were two Friar-
birds in the Zoo, which I think were this species, and others have been
there more recently. Habitat: North Australia.
The Yellow Honey-eater, Broadbentia jlava (Gld.) is said to have
been imported, but Neunzig says " doubtful ". Two other species (and
probably others) have been kept in Australian aviaries ; these are
Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera (Lath.), the Crescent Honey-eater, and
Myzomela dibapha (Lath.), the Sanguineous H., or " Blood-bird ".
I conclude by mentioning that " Neunzig " above refers to that
author's Die Fremdldndische Stubenvogel, 1923. Aviculture, vol. i,
deals with the family, but only to the extent of two pages. Any
additions to this list will be welcome as a help to completeness.

Articles written for the Magazine about this time in recent years
have been headed " Breeding Notes from a Somerset Aviary ". That
I have but little breeding to " note " this year may be partly due to
the removal of my considerably reduced breeding stock from the
milder climate of Taunton to unfinished aviaries here, at Enborne,

quite sufficient to discourage any but the most prolific birds. In com-
parison with former years all my birds were at least six weeks late in
going to nest, most of the earlier clutches were addled, and 1936 has
been my worst breeding season for years. It is but poor satisfaction to
hear the same tale of woe from many others.
Even Red-headed Parrot Finches, which I regard as amongst the
hardiest and most prolific, as well as the most delightful of the smaller
foreign hardbills, have been disappointing ; two pairs having reared
only seven young to date ; as against twelve last season. A friend, who
rather specializes in this species, reckons he can sex his birds by
appearance. I confess that, though I have tried each and every supposed
test, I cannot do so with any certainty and, as happened this season,
my " hens " have turned into cocks--a rather unfortunate habit in the
case of a species the females of which I have found almost impossible
to obtain at any price during the breeding season. As the importation
of Red-heads seems to have almost ceased, and the available stock is
now mainly aviary-bred, this scarcity of hens is rather surprising. In
my experience it is easy enough to sex adult cocks by their call-note
and behaviour, but the hens cannot be so easily detected. As with many
other species, two cocks will nest, roost, and go about together, and
generally behave as though a true pair. It may be worth mentioning
in this connection that when, for any reason, the parents are not
available to incubate or rear, a good pair of Gouldians are excellent--
in my experience even more satisfactory than Bengalese for rearing
Parrot Finches.
The behaviour of the Gouldians with me this season goes to support
the contention that they are particularly susceptible to local conditions,
of which I think the water supply is the most important. When at
Taunton I found them both delicate and uncertain breeders. Here,
on the contrary, they have been just the opposite, and one of the first
species to go to nest. The alteration may, of course, be partly due to
strain--though my present pairs were picked up more or less at random,
and by way of experiment to see how this locality would suit them.
If they are to be used as fosters for semi-insectivorous birds I find it is
a good plan to get them on to milksop, upon which many such species
can be effectively reared. Mine made free use of it when rearing Parrot

Finches this season, and the young so fostered and fed seemed to mature
as quickly, and be quite as hardy, as those reared by their natural
parents.
Cherry Finches have been disappointing this season in comparison
to last--when one pair reared twelve young. T think they require a
really warm summer to do well, and they certainly didn't get it this
year ! Some Cherry hens seem to suffer from a malady akin to egg-
binding, and with similar symptoms, even though no egg is concerned.
If caged in a warm place for a day or so they generally recover quickly,
and seem none the worse for the experience. Incidentally hen Cherry
Finches seem even scarcer than Parrot Finches, and repeated advertise-
ments and inquiries failed to secure a mate for a fine cock, which is
still languishing as a bachelor. After three abortive attempts Ruficaudas
are only now (October) rearing their first brood. The earlier failures
were due to addled rather than to infertile eggs and this, and similar
experiences this season with Dufresne's Waxbills and some other species,
makes one wonder whether there may not be some foundation for the
old belief that a severe thunderstorm--of which we had several just
then--may not contribute to this result.
For the second year in succession Black Seed-finches (Melopyrrha
nigra ) have failed to rear. In each case failure was due to the hen going
into a moult and deserting the young just before the latter were ready
to fly.
To any members interested in Doves I commend a species I have
" discovered ". Until I can take the parents to the South Kensington
Museum to compare them with the skins there, I cannot be sure that
I have correctly identified them as the Bronze Kecked (Zenaida
auriculata), which they certainly resemble very closely. My pair were
privately imported from Chile, and are quite the steadiest and most
delightful birds of this family I have come across. In size a little larger
than the Peaceful, the cock is rufus-coloured with a good deal of
iridescent bronze on the throat, the hen duller with no bronze, and the
young dark grey with indistinct barrings on the wings. The species
seems very prolific ; my pair, though freshly imported, immediately
laying a succession of rather large eggs, which they either neglected or
only partly incubated, until they settled down in earnest in September

and proved most exemplary parents. In steadiness they vie with
Barbary and, though confined in a small aviary they have, so far, shown
no tendency to attack their young. Whatever species or subspecies
they eventually turn out to be I hope to propagate them as very suitable
for aviculture. They feed from the hand and seem quite devoid of that
nervousness which makes so many species of Dove an annoyance rather
than a pleasure.
In September I was fortunate enough to secure---at a price !--
two pairs of that rare and beautiful species the Painted Finch (Emblema
picta), which I am informed is now scarce even in Australia. These
were privately imported and said to have been aviary-bred. One pair
I passed on to my friend, our member Mr. Gerald de Pass, and, being
so late in the season, put the other pair in an attic which I have had
adapted as an inside aviary, with a small flight-cage and " central
heating " designed mainly for winter use. A week later this pair seemed
to be interested in a wire-netting cylinder partly filled with hay, placed
low down in the aviary. On inspecting this a few days later I found it
contained three eggs, apparently deserted by their owners. The hen
Painted Finch had started to moult. As previous experience has warned
me never to discard derelict eggs in an aviary containing any rare
birds, I optimistically gave two of these to a pair of Ruficaudas and the
other to Bengalese--both these pairs having just started incubation.
At the moment of writing it looks as though my optimism was to be
rewarded for in the Bengalee nest there is one youngster, which is
certainly a Bengalee, and another which as certainly is not; while the
other nest contains at least one fledgeling unlike any young Ruficauda
I have ever seen.
It may be expecting rather much to rear Painted Finches in an
unheated outside aviary at this time of the year. Should I be fortunate
enough to do so I will ask our Editor to include a further note about
them next month. According to that benefactor of Aviculture,
Dr. Hopkinson, they were bred by Mr. H. Willford in 1910, and (from
the same pair) by Mr. Mathias the following year, and by A. J.
Patterson in 1935, but apart from a short article by Mr. Seth-Smith
and an excellent plate in Yol. X (1932) of the Magazine, there does
not seem to be much information available. In his valuable book on

Australian Finches Mr. Cayley gives but little information about this
species. In no account have I seen it mentioned that they spend much
of their time and always roost on the ground.
I would add a word to the recent correspondence about the value of
Bengalese as foster parents, in agreement with Mr. Teague that their
virtues in this connection are not sufficiently realized. Apart from the
incubation of deserted eggs, their regular use in the case of rarer species
often means securing considerably more young per pair per season from
the latter. If the whole clutch is removed and given to Bengalese or
other suitable fosters the rarer pair will generally lay again within
ten days or a fortnight, instead of waiting six weeks or more until their
young are independent. Individual pairs of Bengalese vary con-
siderably in reliability and it is advisable to mark those which have
proved good rearers of their own young before entrusting them with
those of more valuable species.
Note ( later ).--All four young referred to in the above article have
been reared--and all are undoubtedly Buficaudas ! The solution of the
mystery of a youug Buficauda in the Bengalee nest is to be found in a
completely forgotten note made when transferring the eggs, to the effect
that one Buficauda egg was placed in the Bengalee nest, together with
two Painted Finch eggs. Evidently, as was only to be expected under
the circumstances, all three Painted eggs were infertile. Confusion
was made " more confounded " by the one Buficauda reared by the
Bengalese squeezing through the half-inch netting separating the com-
partments, thus making it appear that the pair of Buficaudas had
produced four young from three of their own eggs !

By G. H. Blair, F.S.A.A.
One day a friend of mine asked me if I would like " a pink and grey
Parrot " and immediately I recognized the " Galah ". This bird had
been offered to him, but as he had a family and no aviary and the bird
w r as reputed to be spiteful he decided to pass the offer on to me. Need-
less to say, I was not long in making up my mind.

Accordingly, a stated day having been appointed, I collected the
64 pink and grey Parrot " and proudly conveyed " it " to my home.
I say " it " because at that time I had no idea of the sex, and, of course,
that was the next thing to be discovered.
Now another weakness I have other than birds is books, and I have
collected all kinds of literature on birds. I delved into various books
and articles and came to the definite conclusion that my Galah was
a hen. Naturally the next step was to find a cock, but this did not seem
quite as easy as I should have liked, because although I went to see
several Galahs they all turned out to be hens.
Some considerable time had now passed, in fact, even had I found
a cock the end of the breeding season had arrived so there was no hope
of doing anything that year. However, I had won the bird's affection,
and I dare not go round my aviaries without stopping at the one she
occupied for a little tete-a-tete. She became so tame that I could walk
about my garden with her on my shoulder without any attempt at
escape.
But the great day eventually arrived---I heard of another Galah,
and on visiting the house where it was kept I found, to my delight, that
it was a beautiful cock. The deal was very soon satisfactorily con-
cluded and I returned triumphantly with the " gentleman It wn,s
December, but a day or two after I got him home we had a very mild
spell of weather, and I decided to introduce the couple. I had no
intention of permanently releasing the cock but " the best laid schemes
. . On the Sunday morning I took him down in his cage to the hen
and hung him in the flight. There was an immediate display of interest,
which rapidly developed into enthusiasm, so I opened the cage door.
Instead of him making his exit she, the forward miss, was in the cage
with him. It was a case of love at first sight. After much screeching
and raising and lowering of crests she tempted him (how old this
feminine accomplishment is) out of the cage, and there, perforce, he
stayed because I couldn't get him into the cage again. I visited that
aviary with trepidation every morning for weeks because the weather
changed and we had a spell of fog and frost. He didn't seem tc mind,
however, and the two birds seemed to spend hours preening each other's
feathers.

G. H. Blair--Galahs
And then the spring of 1936 came round, and my enthusiasm over-
ran the bounds of discretion, because as early as March I installed a
" clock " nest in the flight of their aviary. There was an immediate
display of interest in the nest, and simultaneously a decided intention
to keep me out of the aviary. Where once there had been affection for
me there now was almost hatred. I didn't mind, because I felt that it
was a warranty at least of their good intentions for the coming breeding
season.
On the 16fch of March she laid her first egg, but must have been
dissatisfied with the attempt, for it was thrown out without ceremony.
Three days afterwards she made a second attempt and apparently this
met with the entire approval of both of them, for she commenced to sit.
From that moment I left them severely alone, and read all I could
about Galahs. My spirits were somewhat damped by reading in
Lord Tavistock's wonderful book that breeding results could not be
expected in an aviary less than 28 feet by 12 feet---mine was only half
this size, and a " fixed " structure to boot. All my " birdy " friends
thought me a wonderful optimist, and my non-birdy friends smiled
patronisingly and felt sorry for me. Still I hoped and on the 20th of
April I heard sounds of life in the " clock ", and a week later the
opportunity arose to take a " peep "--I took the opportunity and saw
my first young Galah. It w r as an ugly little thing, quite naked and for
all the world like an outsize in young Budgies.
Various " peeps " proved that the youngster was growing apace
and on 4th June it made its first appearance in public. It looked
beautiful, and the parents were inordinately proud. They fed it
assiduously for weeks after it left the nest, and then, wonder of wonders,
went to nest again and in due time presented me with another bouncing
youngster, which has now left the nest and is entirely independent of
its parents.
To such experienced aviculturists as Lord Tavistock the breeding
of Galahs may not be much of an achievement, but to the ordinary
sort of fellow with limited time, space, and money like me, it is some-
thing of a milestone. It was my first success in breeding any of the
Parrot-like birds with the exception of Budgies. During the whole of
the breeding season I fed the birds on a mixture of Spanish canary.

smaller quantities. Galahs are most interesting birds to keep, amusing
in their habits, and kept singly, of an affectionate disposition, but they
have a well-developed propensity for eating through the woodwork
of their aviaries, so that it is necessary to protect these from their
wonderfully sharp beaks by stretching wire-netting over all the

(Estrilda nonnula)

This Waxbill was very rare in captivity until 1935, when Mr. C. S.
Webb brought a number from the Cameroons, as well as pairs of

<bodyText confidence="0.951709473684211" page_id="56289891"  page_num="323" year="" vol="">
Estrilda atricapilla, known as the Black-capped Red-flanked Waxbill.
Mr. Webb has given me some particulars which may be of general
interest.
They are forest Waxbills, living in the open spaces among the
undergrowth. Estrilda nonnula nests in low bushes, while E. atricapilla
is often found nesting in small trees. Their distribution extends from
the Cameroons, through Central Africa, to the western side of Kenya
Cclony. E. nonnula when first caught is easy to establish, while E .
atricapilla is much more difficult, and has to be fed on the grass-seed
on which they feed in their wild state for some little time. I understand
that these are the only two Black-crowned or Black-capped Waxbills
in existence. It is curious that being in many respects similar in
appearance they should live, as they often do, side by side as distinct,
species and with different habits.
My pair of E. nonnula made an attempt at nesting last year, but
got no further than laying tiny rounded eggs of creamy white colour.
In May this year they were again turned out in an aviary, with
inside shelter and outside covered run. With them was a pair of the
beautiful Red-headed Parrot Finch ( Erythrura prasina) ; in the inner

portion of the aviary I placed a large bundle of pea-sticks, reaching
from floor to roof; the Red-heads soon made a typical nest in this,
and the Waxbills followed with one above it touching the low roof;
it was domed and rounded, made of soft hay, and lined with a
few feathers. Eggs were laid and came to nothing.
In July the weather was dreadful--constant rain and very cold.
The Waxbills repaired their nest and soon were evidently sitting,
because one bird was always missing. I supplied seeding wild grasses,
insectivorous food, yolk of egg, but they abandoned their nest and sat
disconsolate ; so I went in and found four dead youngsters from one
to four days old and came to the conclusion they had died through lack
of something in the diet. The birds began again, and this time I
determined to leave no stone unturned ! I soaked many seeds in wet
sand round the water-pot; so that they were always germinating. I
gave the birds fresh seeding grasses twice daily, and my kind friend,
Mr. A. Morrison, sent me a huge box of leaf-mould teeming with live
ants' eggs. The Waxbills at once began eating them, and they
accounted for a surprising number per day ; for a time they ate little
else, they seemed to search for and find minute insects, and they loved
a flowering grass-seed, called, I believe, Boa jperennis, which abounds
in London gardens fortunately.
The hen slept in the nest the first twelve days or so after hatching
but afterwards she slept out with the cock ; they were both very
secretive about their affairs, but later they frequently went into the
nest while I was watching. I managed not to interfere until the
youngsters were nearly due to leave the nest; and then one day I did
dare all, and boldly went in and felt inside to retire happy and
relieved, for I touched masses of little warm quills !
I then removed the Parrot Finches and their young to another
aviary, and had the pleasure some days later of finding four healthy
little Waxbills out and about--not over wild, and well able to find
their way in and out of the nest, which they did frequently in the day
and always at night. At the time of writing the birds are two months
old and they still all sleep in the old nest. In coloration these young
Waxbills are very like the parents, but the beaks are black and not
tipped with red above as in the adults, and they have white beads at

the base which are still visible to-day and show up well in the photo
published with these notes.
Both parents fed the young ; no distinct sound came from the
nest, though I felt pretty sure I heard them ; still there was no certainty.
A week after leaving the nest they were picking up hard seed
for themselves.
The parent birds were anxious to nest again, and the hen did, in fact,
lay one egg and then showed signs of inflammation, so I removed her
indoors where she quickly recovered. From then onwards the cock
carried on alone. It was during this last courtship that I saw the cock
display in the usual manner of Waxbills, with a long piece of hay in
beak he slowly jumps up and down, uttering a small note, at which
sound the hen comes to his side and pairing takes place.
After many failures it is a source of pleasure and satisfaction to be
able to record the successful rearing of this lovely little quartet.

By Mrs. K. Drake, Mylor, Falmouth
For seven years have I tried to breed these beautiful African
Waxbills, never getting any further than the eggs, sometimes just
hatched. This year I was very fortunate in finding a good supply of
ants' cocoons at the very time it was needed, which no doubt pleased
them much. The shelter is 4 feet square, and the outside flight 14 feet
by 7 feet 6 inches by 6 feet, and planted with one thick shrub where the
nest was, and three or four smaller flowering shrubs. The nest was the
usual Waxbill domed affair of hay and feathers, and there were about
three other nests, some with eggs in, white ones. I thought the eggs
were hatched about the 14th or 15th July, but it must have been much
earlier. I must have got muddled with some of the earlier nests left
still in the bush, as when I had a 'phone message calling me up to Town
on the 20th July, I flew up to the Violet-ears' aviary to see how advanced
the young birds were and felt two very big, well-feathered (not down)

birds ; they certainly must have been nearly three weeks then. I told
my husband what to do and left a huge supply of live ants' cocoons,
also showing him where there were more to be found, then I went to the
station on my sad journey. A week after my young daughter came
home and took charge of my birds. I wrote and told her to watch the
Violet-ears carefully as they ought to be out of the nest. Not till
the 10th August did I hear from her that " the young birds were sitting
in the bush, which, by the way, was considerably overgrown and needed
clipping badly The young must have been nearly five weeks old,
instead of just out of the nest; also my husband says he saw the young
birds eating spray millet with their parents. I then wrote my
daughter to remove the young in about two weeks' time or earlier, not
later ; but the " little daughter " thought she knew best, or was too
engaged with her two young friends spending a week with her ! So
the next news was " both birds found dead this a.m., the 28th August ".
I think the birds lived 8 to 8J weeks. I was dreadfully disappointed
when I received the dead body, so plump and then showing that lovely
blue on the upper tail-coverts and the black beak was changing to red.
On the 10th August my daughter calculated their measurement as
3 |inches from beak to tip of tail, the tail alone measuring 1J to If inches.
For weeks before I left, the parents seemed to live on seeding grass
and live ants' cocoons, and later devouring the heads of mealworms,
evidently feeding their young on those three articles ; a little later
more Indian millet and spray millet and C.L.O. food was taken. When
I left, those foods also were hurriedly written down by me, to be given
three, four, or five times daily as I had been doing. The plumage of the
young birds was a light brown, with black tail, black eyes and beak,
feet greyish.
There is one more item I must not forget to mention. When I was
feeling inside the nest, there being three or more nests all close together,
I found the two birds in a nest with two openings, their heads at one
end and the tails sticking out at the other. First I thought it was the
hen still sitting, but both parents were flying frantically around.
Would the two openings be easier for the parents to slip in and out, or
was it because at that time the weather was extremely hot ? The other
nests I have since pulled down with eggs in, and one with dead chicks

a week old in, had only the one opening. With luck next year I shall
make a point of examining the nest after the young leave.
Of course, do not go away with the idea that I look into nests daily !
It was because of my urgent call that I had to find out, so as to write
everything down re feeding, doling out new feathers, etc., etc., for my
good husband to carry on. There is no doubt the parents had killed
the young, as they went to nest again near the outside of the bush,
and heavy rains at that time spoilt it. I think I have said all.

LABOUR SAVING IN THE AVIARY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.99483468" page_id="56289897"  page_num="327" year="" vol="">
By Dr. M. Amsler, M.B., F.Z.S.
When going the rounds of other people's aviaries I have often
been struck by the fact that the average aviculturist is a most unprac-
tical person--or is it that he is so interested in and devoted to his
birds that he never thinks of himself ?
It is the rarest thing to come across a gadget or any form of labour-
saving device which one goes home and copies.
If you can spare me the space in your columns I should like to
mention just a few of these which may come in useful to others, and
incidentally save much time in the daily routine.
One often sees bird-keepers going backwards and forwards--first
for the mealworms, next perhaps for some fresh water, and then
they find they have forgotten the spray millet. All this va et vient
disturbs the birds and means a lot of unnecessary opening and shutting
of doors, quite apart from time wasted. I have for years used a very
simple little affair on the principle of the drawing-room cake tray---
it consists of two shallow boxes--one stands on the ground and by
means of battens nailed at the ends the upper box stands about
18 inches higher and has a round wooden handle nailed across the
top, by which the whole contrivance is carried about. The handle
for convenience in carrying, should not be more than 2 feet from
the ground level. On the top floor I carry canary, Indian, and white
millet in " Bath-Oliver " biscuit tins, there is also room for the meal-
worms, the soft food, and one or two small boxes of delicacies such
as niger, hemp, maw seed, etc.

328 Dr. M. Amsler--Labour Saving in the Aviary
On the lower shelf are the water-can, and a big tin containing
the Pheasants 5 mixed corn. Two most useful adjuncts are a flat spade-
shaped scraper which can be used instead of a spoon for serving out
the soft food, and for the usual scraping and cleaning, and also a
little mop on a handle--lately presented to me by my wife--price 2 d.,
I believe. This is most useful for swabbing out the water vessels
before replenishing and now the mornings are getting chilly all
those who suffer from cold hands will find this a great boon after
having experienced the chilly effects of using an ordinary sponge in
frosty weather.
We have of late read a good deal about Pheasants and have been
encouraged to keep them in aviaries containing small birds. I do
so myself and am very fond of Pheasants, but a note of warning should,
I think, be sounded.
Pheasants are very intelligent or cunning and wherever you put
food for the smaller birds they very soon find it.
As one cannot afford to feed such birds on spray millet--or soft
food, costing 2s. a pound, some means must be devised to frustrate
them. I had thought of having a frame with 3 in. wire mesh to cover
the shelves carrying the small bird's food and made a rough experi-
mental model, but it was no use, as the Pheasants clambered up and
poked their heads through the netting--any smaller mesh would have
excluded medium-sized birds such as Doves, Thrushes, and Starlings.
I have now completely circumvented my Pheasants again with
an arrangement resembling a cake tray. Mine are made of wood and
consist of four little platforms about 9 inches square, one above the
other, and suspended by a wire from the aviary shed roof--the idea
is not original, for many of the aviary appliance manufacturers supply
a similar contrivance, the frame being made of strong wire with two
or more shelves which carry the earthenware seed pans.
Some softbills are dreadfully wasteful with their food. Shamas,
in my experience, are the worst offenders. This can be remedied to
a large extent by fitting a tin or zinc lid to the soft- food receptacle.
I use a glass tongue dish about 4 inches in diameter, and the zinc
cover has a circular hole, some 2 inches across. One thus has a flange

economy, I think there is also this advantage, that there is very little
food left lying about, which in time might become sour or otherwise
unwholesome.
While on the subject of soft food it would be interesting to have
a census of those who moisten it with water, carrot, apple, etc., and
those who use some form of fat instead of water. For years I have
been using dripping, melted and mixed with the food in the proportion
of about 2 lb. of fat to 5 or 6 lb. of the mixture. Not long ago I asked
a leading exhibitor and judge of softbills how much fat he advised
one to use, and his answer was that fat was poison to softbills, and
that he was surprised that a man of my experience should use it.
1 hurried to my aviaries to see whether all my birds were dead, and
was relieved to find they looked much as usual. I do not keep the
very delicate and difficult species, and it is possible that my mixture
would upset such subjects as long-tailed Tits, Wrens, or Dartford
Warblers, on the other hand, the fatted food does not go sour and
is eaten to the last crumb--whereas food moistened with water often
smells bad at the end of one day in hot weather, and must be
thrown away.
In many a well-appointed aviary I have often seen catching nets
which almost made one weep. Sometimes they were old landing nets,
in which the poor birds, of course, become hopelessly entangled, more
often one sees an ordinary butterfly net which is also an unsuitable
weapon. Birds are usually caught up in the outer-flight portion of
the aviary---the roof of which is flat---a pear-shaped ring to the net
is therefore wrong, the best shaped ring is an equilateral triangle
with its apex at the handle of the net, which should be a thick broom-
stick, 2 or 3 feet long.
The ring itself is best made of stout galvanized iron wire and a
most important point is that it should be well padded. This is done
by wrapping a large amount of cotton wool or tow round the wire
and keeping it in position by a spiral binding of thin string--the net,
made of butter muslin, can then be fixed on---it should be about
2 to 3 feet deep and conical in shape, deep so that the bird does not
easily escape when once caught, and conical so that one does not have
to hunt for him in the corners of the net.

Dr. M. Amsler--Labour Saving in the Aviary
With a properly made net, constructed on these lines, it is the rarest
experience to have a bird injured in catching up, a frequent necessity
in the keeping of birds--and in my opinion one of the most disagreeable
duties connected with our hobby.
So strongly do I feel on this point that I have at last found time
to fit each one of my aviaries with a little box-like affair some 2 feet
long which hangs on the wires--in this I can place the food pans.
I have a movable wired front with a trap-door, which fits all the
boxes and all one has to do is to pull a string when the required bird
or birds enter the box. At one end of these trap boxes there is a small
opening through which captured birds can be driven into a cage,
so that no handling whatsoever is really necessary.
The only drawback to this method is that it takes time and that
it is necessary to keep the birds without food for an hour or so before
" setting " the trap.
Every aviary should, in my opinion, have a water fountain and
a seed hopper as adjuncts to the usual water and seed vessels. If
by any chance either of these two are overlooked you have the assurance
that your birds will not go short for that day.
The best hoppers and fountains are home-made from clear or non-
coloured wine bottles, such as are used for white wines. Two brackets
are firmly fixed to a piece of strong deal, about 18 inches by 6 inches.
The lowest bracket is merely a platform to take the water or seed vessels.
The next one above this is shaped to take the shoulder of the bottle
so that its mouth comes not nearer than J in. from the bottom
bracket and at the top of the board is fixed a strong wire ring which
fits the base of the bottle and keeps it in a vertical position.
To clean the inside of the bottle when used for water it is occasionally
necessary to shake it vigorously after pouring in a little water with
some coarse sand or gravel. When used as a seed hopper it is best to
fix up a shallow box or tray just below the contrivance, for some
birds, especially some of the Parrakeets and Budgerigars will empty
a whole bottle out of sheer devilry, also it must be remembered that
birds have to learn to use these hoppers--this they very quickly do
but in the event of using them to the exclusion of the ordinary
open vessels, one must always remember to place one or two ordinary

food and waterpans about the aviary if a new bird is expected. In
less than no time he will learn to copy the other birds, after which
the above precaution is not necessary.
Doves are perhaps the stupidest of birds in finding their way
about a new aviary. Why is it that these otherwise charming and
easy birds are such fools ?
I refer particularly to their habit of suddenly becoming scared
and dashing about the aviary as if one were chasing them.
The ordinary seed hopper which one can buy is quite a good affair,
but not totally devoid of risk, for the lower end of the " shoot " through
which the seed slides down is liable to become blocked with dust and
husks, and although a casual glance at the glass front indicates that
there is plenty of seed for the birds, a closer inspection shows that
the poor things are pecking away and getting nothing.
In these days when the whole world, including our Government,
is advocating physical jerks and deep breathing, we aviculturists
can at least hold up our heads and say that we as a class draw deep
breaths at least a hundred times a day--and many of us do it in the
open before breakfast. How much breath we do waste in blowing
away husks, much of which could be saved by a little common sense.
If there is any wind at all, all that one need do is to pour the seed
from its containers into a box held 2 or 3 feet lower. This not
only gets rid of husks but also blows away the dust which, of
course, usually accumulates in the pan when it is merely shaken and
blown.
I have lately made a little gadget which still requires perfecting--
but which even now is most useful.
It consists of two little boxes about the size of cigar boxes--which
are superimposed with a space of some 3 inches between the upper
and the lower. The bottom of the upper box is made of large mesh
perforated zinc, which will allow a hemp seed to pass through easily
--the lower box has a bottom of fine wire gauze which will not even
allow the passage of Indian millet. When seed is poured into the
upper storey it all runs through with the exception of seed which has
been fouled and any odd bits of rubbish which birds often carry into
their seed pans--a shake or two and all the dust escapes through the

wire sieve at the bottom, after which all that is necessary is to give
a good blow between the boxes and one gets rid of all the husks.
I have just read through these notes and it has struck me very
forcibly that I have written in a vein which appears to presuppose
a great superiority of knowledge on my part--the explanation is
that I am of a practical turn of mind and a bit of a carpenter to boot.

A GOOD CAT TRAP
By W. H. Workman
I wonder if aviculturists in England are as much bothered with
predatory cats as we are here round Belfast. One year I had a Teal
taken oh my small pond, but a B.S.A. 22 air-rifle settled accounts
next morning when she returned for the drake. Then the wretched
brutes would sit on the tops of the aviaries bouncing about and
frightening all the birds into a wild state of panic ; a gun was no use
here. Finally we had a hard frost, the pond got frozen solid, and in a
few days I lost four valuable ducks, not counting odd ones at other times.
A friend came to the rescue with his cat-trap and now peace reigns,
for we had little trouble in capturing four enormous semi-wild cats,
which we quietly despatched in a good deep pond. From that time
we have had no trouble ; we seem to have rid the country of these
murderers.
The trap which I am about to describe was made for me by Messrs.
John Rogers, Ltd., of 68 Victoria Street, Belfast, and it cost the small
sum of 18s. 6 d. As you will see from the photographs, it is a long oblong
box of square wire-mesh sitting on a galvanized sheet-iron floor--*
length 3 feet, breadth 1 foot, height 1 foot. You will see from the close-
up the door opens upwards and outwards with a spring at the top and
a long rod, which, when the door is closed, stands straight up (Fig. 1).
To set the trap this rod is pulled down and just caught in the trigger-
loop (Fig. 2), below which the bait is hung. The cat smells the bait,

goes in at the open door, seizes the bait, releases the trigger, and the
spring does the rest by instantly snapping the door to. Now comes the
ingenious part of the trap, for a large cat could push the door open if it
wasn't for the " Locking Bar If you will look closely at the " close-
up " of the door (Fig. 3), you will observe two vertical rods, one on each
side, with a horizontal sliding rod running up and down them. When
setting the trap this rod is held at the top and lies just above the hinge
when the trap-door is open, but immediately the door closes, down
falls the horizontal bar along its guides and most effectually locks the
door against any pushing from the inside.
For bait I found fish-heads were excellent, but they must be fairly
fresh. The cats wouldn't touch them if too old, perhaps they got dried
up hanging out in the air and lost their rather unpleasant aroma.
This trap can be put to other uses, such as catching up birds in an
aviary. Simply bait the floor of the trap with suitable food, attach a
long string to the trigger, and, when the bird is in, a slight pull is all
that is required to make a successful capture.
THE ENGLISH STARLING IN SOUTHERN
TEXAS, U.S.A.
By James B. Housden
In one of my visits to Southern Texas, U.S.A., I found the enclosed
in one of their local daily papers : " English Starling, Imported Pest,
Discovered Here. Fruit Crops Menaced by Bird. Attack Native

it to A. K. B. Witte Memorial Museum.

334 J. B. Housden--The English Starling in Southern Texas
and in nooks of buildings, they crowd out a class of native birds that
managed to hold their own with the Sparrows. In the fall they gather
in large flocks, doing much damage to fruit; even in the breeding season
flocks gather in cherry orchards, when cherry-seeds are literally rained
down. What damage they will do to fruit in Texas is not yet known.
" The bird is larger than Red-winged Blackbirds and smaller than
the Meadow Lark. At a few feet it is a dark bird, with light speckling
on the feather-tips. At close range there is a beautiful bronze sheen
about the head and breast. The tips of the feathers are pointed instead
of rounded, an important feature for identifying the bird. The main
objection to the appearance here of the Starling is that it will drive a
dozen native birds to the backwoods, where they cannot be enjoyed."
My first visit to my brother's Southern Texas home (a bungalow
on the border of the forest, no roads or paths ; after a storm the tract
was like a river). Our home had a gallery (verandah) on three sides of
the house. I found a seat on the gallery where I could overlook all
the gardens near, and a large tract of the Texas Blue Bonnet (the
national flower of Texas). All around was very beautiful and gorgeous
flowers everywhere ; bird life was very apparent.
Almost the first thing I noticed were some rough tree trunks
(carrying some telegraph wires); some pretty Red-headed Woodpeckers
had made their homes in the round holes they had made in these
tree-trunks ; also some small Tits were doing the same in other holes.
On one side of the house a pair of Humming Birds would wash
under the leaky tap of water and fly up to a wire just over my head to
preen and dry themselves, watching me with their small black eyes.
From the top of a post a beautiful Red Cardinal sang most of the day.
On another side of our bungalow grew a number of rose-trees, bearing
blue roses ; a pair of Humming Birds built their nest in one of these
trees. Sitting on our gallery one had the opportunity of watching many
birds. One afternoon I was interested in a flock of English Sparrows
in some tall trees mobbing, as I thought, an Owl. I found it was one of
the Goatsuckers (the Whip poor Will) that caused all the excitement
to the birds all around.
Four gate-posts with movable tops, in front of the house, I found
were occupied--the first by a pair of Long-billed Marsh Wrens, the

next by a pair of Brown Creepers, the third by a pair of English
Sparrows, and the fourth was a hornets' nest.
I found the American Mocking Birds and nests in abundance. This
bird has been adopted as the " State Bird of Texas ". One day I
picked up a young bird, fully fledged ; it was a beautifully marked
bird, and as it began to scream the old birds flew at me and pecked my
cap. I put it in a place of safety and when I came back the old birds
attacked me again.
Near the house we had a mealie patch ; when the cobs were young
and tender, beautiful Hangnests (Baltimore, Orchard, and Bullocks) and
a number of other kinds of birds came there to feed. Near our dining-
room window a pair of Mourning Doves built their nest; these were
very tame until the young were hatched, then the hen bird would drop
from the nest and flutter over the lawn as with a broken wing, to draw
one from the nest, in the same way as our Peewit does at home.
After a storm it was surprising the number of nests (chiefly English
Sparrows) that one found in the road, washed down by the storm. In
these, when built in trees, I found the entrance near the bottom of
the nest.
One very hot day I was sitting watching a number of Mocking Birds
hunting for grasshoppers. While watching these birds I saw with them
what I thought was a Purple Grackle ; to my great surprise I saw it
was a beautiful cock English Starling (the only one I have ever seen
in my journeys in Southern Texas, Arizona, or Mexico).
These are favourite birds of the writer's at home (they build near
my house at Sydenham). I thought that afternoon what gave me
the most pleasure--watching Humming Birds and other birds or the
Starling ? I think the latter.
After being away from home several months one may get, like the
writer, a little homesick. The Starling's food, I think, both at home
and abroad are several kinds of insect pests.

It was with, a certain amount of trepidation that the O.P.S. decided
to make the showing of Pheasants one of their principal methods of
popularizing Ornamental Pheasants. We will now admit that we had
to work more or less in the dark : we were told by some that Pheasants
would show badly, and would by their repeated attempts to gain their
liberty from the pens, create a very bad Impression rather than a
good one. Our fears were partly allayed last January at the Crystal
Palace Show, but now I am able to give first-hand information on the
great bird show that was held at Glasgow the last few days of October.
I felt greatly honoured in being asked to judge the Pheasant section,
but I do not wish to dwell on this. I was in attendance for the two
days, and I was amazed at the extraordinary interest that was taken
in our Section.
Many people would not believe they were Pheasants, whilst others
were certain they had been painted.
There were twenty-five entries, and this was a most satisfactory
number for a new venture.
With the exception of one very naughty little Golden cock, all
the others appeared perfectly content: one lady remarked to me,
" The Pheasants seem to be thoroughly enjoying their publicity."
During this winter we are patronizing eight more large shows,
and if they are as successful as the City of Glasgow Ornithological
Association, then we need have no fears for the future.
I should particularly like to thank the Committee and all officials
of this show for their wonderful hospitality and unfailing courtesy,
this I do on behalf of the O.P.S. They could not have done more for
us, and made me realize to the full what a wonderfully hospitable
country Scotland is.
If any members of our Society have felt nervous about showing
Pheasants, let me most definitely assure them that they need have
no qualms.
I know for a fact that none of the Pheasants shown were prepared
specially for the show at Glasgow, but all with the exception mentioned
behaved themselves in a most admirable manner.

BLUE TAHITI LORY
</sectionHeader>
<bodyText confidence="0.989667608695653" page_id="56289909"  page_num="337" year="" vol="">
Madam, --I have been the proud possessor of a skin of the rare Tahiti
Blue Lory for some years, and it was a great pleasure to see the coloured plate
in the March number of the Magazine with M. Delacour's article.
Quite recently I had the good fortune to see three live specimens in the
private aviary of Mr. W. J. Sheffler, of Los Angeles, who has had the birds
for nearly a year. They were brought over by Mrs. Fredrika Bonestell, of
Oakland, and are the only live specimens in the United States. They are two
males and one female, in splendid condition, kept in small cages. Mr. Sheffler
fully hopes to breed them, and I think that the conditions here are most
favourable, more so in Southern California than in Europe. After having
tried with no success to get the little Lories to eat almost every kind of fresh
fruit, the only fruit it was found they would take are fresh pears procurable
here all the year ; they are also fed daily with boiled milk and honey. Lately
it has been noticed that they are ready to mate, but the reluctance of the
female has necessitated their being separated for the present.
Dr. Derscheid, of Brussels, remarking on this beautiful plate by Roland
Green, says that his paintings are unsurpassed by any other, except perhaps
the paintings by the late Fuertes and some of those by Wilhelm Kuhnert;
which opinion I share. However, I should like to mention some of the other
bird artists whose work is held in very high esteem. Perhaps not so well
known in Europe, but a painter of the first rank in America, is the sportsman-
naturalist, Major Allan Brooks, of British Columbia. His work shows a
strong influence of that wise old master, Joseph Wolf ; his favourites I should
imagine are the larger birds, such as the Waterfowl and birds of prey, while
those paintings published in a recent National Geographic Magazine are not,
in my opinion particularly his best productions.
Jaques, of the American Museum of Natural History, had the enviable
opportunity of studying the birds in their natural surroundings in South and
Central America, and his recent work, reproduced in Dr. Murphy's Oceanic
Birds of South America, evolves a style quite different to that of his colleagues.
Archibald Thorborn is perhaps best for British birds, whereas H. Gronvold,
illustrator of many scientific papers, has a special talent for infusing bird
skins with motion and life ; however, I must say his best work are the Harriers,
and he once told me when he was illustrating Kirke Swann's Monograph of
the Birds of Prey that he had during his youth observed the Harriers closely
and intimately in his native Denmark.
The readers of the Avicultural Magazine must recall the beautiful plate
of the Glittering Copper Pheasant in the June issue by S. Kobayashi. To me
this particular painting is just as beautiful, if not more so, than any of those
of Fuertes or Wolf. No birds from shapeless barnyard fowl to the fast flying
Swifts escape his talent if he can but see them when they are alive. He gained
his first distinction amongst the English readers for the rare Korean Sheldrake,
reproduced as the last plate in Phillips's Monograph of the Duchs, and he has
of late contributed a great many plates to my own Birds of the Philippine
Islands.

Madam, --In my remarks on Mr. Sewell's breeding successes in the
November number (p. 306), I gave Mrs. Drake as the first breeder of Peter's
Spotted Firefinches. I ought to have said " First in the U.K.", for they
have been bred earlier abroad. M. Decoux has written to point this out,
namely that A. Voigt reared young in Germany in 1928, and he gives the
reference " Die Gefiederte Welt, 1930, p. 806." M. Decoux adds that he
thinks that other German breeders have also been successful.

Madam, --It may be of interest to record that the pair of Red-and-yellow
Macaws ( Ara chloroptera) which have nested on previous occasions at
Lilford, have again reared young whilst flying at liberty. On this occasion
two well developed young birds almost identical in appearance with their
parents left the nest on 27th October, and are now (9th November) flying
about with our four adult birds, which include a male reared in 1934.
As usual, nesting operations in the same tall tree occupied the entire
summer, from May onwards, the young never showing themselves until
they appeared on the wing.

Madam, --With regard to the coloured plate of the Long-tailed Grass Finch
which appeared in the November number of the Magazine, I think it should
be pointed out that while the bird at the top of the plate is the typical Poephila
acuticauda acuticauda of Gould, which occurs in north-western Australia,
the one in the centre with the red beak is Heck's Grass Finch (P. acuticauda
hecJci) of Heinroth, which occurs in the Northern Territory.
The lower figure represents an immature, though nearly adult, specimen
of P. acuticauda acuticauda in which the bill, which is black at first, is changing
to yellow, the feet having already become flesh colour, and the central tail
feather attained nearly full length.

MR. PORTER'S "WANDERINGS IN THE FAR EAST"
Madam, --Regarding the article " Wanderings in the Far East," November
instalment; please allow me to correct several obvious mistatements.
First, in the matter of Chinese bird shops of Singapore, which shops, by
the way, are all under strict supervision and regularly inspected by a
European Police Officer, especially detailed to that duty. They are on the
whole no better, and certainly no worse, than those of the average London
or Continental dealer. What they may lack in light (no great desideratum on
the Equator), they most definitely gain in warmth and fresh air. As to the
food supplied, if there is any European capable of teaching the Chinese
anything on birdkeeping, I should like to meet him. My considered opinion,
based on thirty years of close association in business and friendship with the

Straits Chinese, is that of all aviculturists, for sheer practical common
sense, in caging and handling, for unremitting care and attention to their
avian friends or stock, as the case may be, they stand unrivalled.
As for the " absolute antithesis ", I'm afraid the writer has been singularly
unfortunate in his choice of a contrast. Admitted the spacious aviaries and
ideal surroundings (N.B. of a public zoo, as distinct from a mere shop), the
less said about the knowledge of, or care of its very temporary inmates, the
better.
Second, Lories : The present scarcity on the Eastern markets is solely
a matter of supply and demand. Parrots (including Lories) are not on the
" protected " list of birds and animals of the Netherland Indies, and are
still available but, with the existing " ban " on all Parrotlike birds throughout
Europe and most of America, trapping for the market is at present practically
at a standstill.
Regarding the leg shackling of Lories and Parrakeets : Has our essayist
ever tried to keep either in a wicker cage ; or where does he imagine the
Malay or Papuan trapper, whose entire worldly goods comprise maybe a
loincloth and bush knife, would acquire metal cages or wire netting to the
value of several dollars, especially for birds he would be lucky to sell at
fifty cents. Apart from that, what could be more practical than the bamboo
or hardwood swinging perch with coco-nut shell shackle ? Clean, strong,
light, portable, and giving a bird the maximum amount of liberty for wing
exercise consistent with safety.
Some time ago we had three Lories, a Radja ( C . insignis), a Crimson-
fronted ( C . scintillans ), and an Edward's. Each bird had its own 8-in.
perch and stand, the three fitting snugly in a small travelling case measuring
9 by 12 by 12 inches. For several years, these three birds accompanied
us through Malaya, Sumatra, and Java, Siam, Indo-China, the Moluccas,
and New Guinea, eventually reaching England in 1927. " Paddy," the
Crimson-fronted is still to be seen at the Zoological Gardens, as bright and
active as ever, and still wearing his original leg ring !
Finally, Pheasants : That estimate of 80 per cent casualties among trapped
Pheasants is most misleading. Five per cent would be high. Moreover, if
the writer had even the foggiest notion of the methods employed, he would
realize the utter improbability of a Pheasant ever being noosed by the neck
W. J. C. Frost.
A PROLIFIC BLACK SWAN
Madam, --Thinking your readers might be able to give me some informa-
tion, may I recount what seems to me a rather extraordinary performance
on the part of a Black Swan female which I have.
The Blacks are famous for being free breeders, but a pair which I have
seem unusually prolific. In January of this year, this pair nested, the female
(a three-year-old bird) laying four eggs which were chilled and failed to
hatch. In April the birds nested again, with another clutch of four eggs,
two of which were hatched and reared.
In late August another nest was built, this time inside a low shed, and
five eggs were laid on which the female started to sit on 7th September.
After sitting six weeks, we removed the eggs which, though fertile, had failed
to hatch for some reason. The eggs were removed about 20th October, and

the female, after sitting on the nest a day or two, stopped sitting. Now
comes the part which seems unusual to me : on 30th October I noticed the
penne again sitting on the nest and, on examining it, found three newly-laid
eggs. She is now sitting steadily, having laid three more, making a clutch
of six.
It seems quite unbelievable to me that in so short a time after leaving
her former nesting, she could have managed to lay another and larger clutch,
yet there can be no doubt about it as that is the only pair of Swans (except
a non-breeding pair of Whistling) on that pond, which is thoroughly fenced
in so that no other birds could possibly get inside.
Possibly some of your readers can give me an explanation of what seems
to be a most unusual performance.
